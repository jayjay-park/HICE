The authors Dr. Bini amp Dr. Cohn replied in the same issue Annals of Surgery   e by conceding that the critique correctly points out that there are significant discrepancies regarding what constitutes a pit bull among violent dog breeds. There is also a defense of the study that was submitted to JAVMA Annals of Surgery by Carol Miller RN and not accepted for publication but reposted on DogsBite.org Ms. Miller defends three case presentations but does not address the issues of DBRF inconsistencies inaccuracies of dog populations or unreliability of media breed identifications.,science,ceeu2be,1,t5_mouw

3764,0,t3_1u5odz,Heres the screenshot of the site if it doesnt load for some people.  IntroductionSeveral mammalian species spontaneously align their body axis with respect to the Earths magnetic field MF lines in diverse behavioral contexts. Magnetic alignment is a suitable paradigm to scan for the occurrence of magnetosensitivity across animal taxa with the heuristic potential to contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of magnetoreception and identify further functions of magnetosensation apart from navigation. With this in mind we searched for signs of magnetic alignment in dogs. We measured the direction of the body axis in  dogs of  breeds during defecation  observations and urination  observations over a twoyear period. After complete sampling we sorted the data according to the geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the respective sampling periods. Relative declination and intensity changes of the MF during the respective dog walks were calculated from daily magnetograms. Directional preferences of dogs under different MF conditions were analyzed and tested by means of circular statistics. ResultsDogs preferred to excrete with the body being aligned along the Northsouth axis under calm MF conditions. This directional behavior was abolished under Unstable MF. The best predictor of the behavioral switch was the rate of change in declination i.e. polar orientation of the MF. ConclusionsIt is for the first time that a magnetic sensitivity was proved in dogs b a measurable predictable behavioral reaction upon natural MF fluctuations could be unambiguously proven in a mammal and c high sensitivity to small changes in polarity rather than in intensity of MF was identified as biologically meaningful. Our findings open new horizons in magnetoreception research. Since the MF is calm in only about   of the daylight period our findings might provide an explanation why many magnetoreception experiments were hardly replicable and why directional values of records in diverse observations are frequently compromised by scatter.,science,ceev6x1,60,t5_mouw

If these DNA fragments with a certain memory that can be only interpreted by the brain are passed on then the development phases are also affected thus evolution. The avoiding certain smell could be because the smell was paired with a harmful consequence and conditioned as a threat so the brain would store this memory by causing chemical reactions within the body that could rewrite its genes.At least thats how I see it with only  year of college level biology.

Before being diagnosed my grades from th to  and freshman in college were Fs and Cs. I have always loved school and learning even though I failed just about everything except art. While in college my wife notices that I studied for about  hours a day for  days a week but yet I would get Cs or fail the classes. She suggested that I go see a doctor because it was not right for someone that wants to learn the material and dedicates that much time and not even pass the class. My doctor diagnosed me ADHD I at first was hesitant about his diagnosis because Im not hyper but my mind does trail off a lot and I dont like being medicated for anything. After some internal battles about taking the medication I decided to take it. After one semester I managed to go from Cs and Fs to all Bs and I retained everything I learned. I dont take my medication everyday may three times a day those days I dont take it I feel fine and I still study and make an effort to teach myself how to study in hopes that one day I can get off the medication. ,science,cehxxoe,1,t5_mouw

36148,0,t1_cei88im, Hansen  and Kelogg  are both a very long time ago in this context. The rate of retractions in science generally is increasing principally because of better detection and higher standards. It would be interesting to see if the same increase in retraction can be seen in climate science which deals explicitly with confirming the AGW hypothesis at a theoretical level. I wouldnt say peerreview is minimum requirement for anything truly scientific it is a shortcut to reducing the inherent risks involved in running a scientific publication mill. It is mechanized appeal to authority.The only minimum requirement should be valid reasoning and good methodology and sound empirical support. In the long run that is what tends to win out I would like to believe. Graphics with no explanation of methodology get my warning bells ringing and I dont now where your .gif is from. What is the observed temperature for example. Where is it from and how was it arrived at? I tend to be swayed more by sources that describe their methodologiesHe later explains his reasoning further hereLet me clarify what my aim was in this study. The first IPCC report from  and John Houghtons excellent book both make specific predictions over a timeframe short enough where we can actually compare with measurement. It is no good predicting the climate in  since we will all likely be dead by then. Good science makes predictions which experimenters test ie. forecasts  not hindcasts. A simple doubling of CO in the atmosphere calculated for example with MODTRAN forecasts a temperature rise of only about . degree. Current models assume positive feedbacks with HO leading to enhanced warming but these assumptions also need testing.The data show a warming effect of around . degrees since the prediction was made back in . Since  however both trends for HadCru and UAH show no further rise. Only the IPCC lower limit prediction of a . degree rise by  remains compatible with the data. Furthermore an increasing rate of change to be expected by any positive feedback mechanism is also not evident.If you can show me specifically what the error in methodology is here I will gladly change my mind but...I dont accept post hoc corrections for whatever reason that were not explicitly included in the original prediction. Also the average of modeled predictions is not a prediction itself.Here is another graph showing the same thing but his time with error bars and later predictions  Using skeptic models as a reference point is disingenuous because the source of most skepticism is either a denial of the faith in model outputs in the first place and b denial of the existence of feedback loops and trigger points which are not explicitly observable in the historic record.,science,ceijpe9,-1,t5_mouw

How is that adjustment not okay in this context? I dont see what the problem is in testing models using more precise parameters. From the link you providedgtThe IPCC FAR ran simulations using models with climate sensitivities the total amount of global surface warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO including amplifying and dampening feedbacks of .C low .C best and .C high for doubled CO Figure .  However because climate scientists at the time believed a doubling of atmospheric CO would cause a larger global heat imbalance than is currently believed the actual climate sensitivities were approximatly  lower for example the Best model sensitivity was actually closer to .C for doubled CO.gtFigure  IPCC FAR projected global warming in the BAU emissions scenario using climate models with equilibrium climate sensitivities of .C low .C best and .C high for doubled atmospheric COgtFigure  accounts for the lower observed GHG emissions than in the IPCC BAU projection and compares its Best adjusted projection with the observed global surface warming since .I fail to see what the problem is here. Can you explain it clearly?gtI can predict anything correctly if I allowed to adjust my prediction afterwards to match subsequent observation.The adjustments arent arbitrary though. Thats where your argument fails.gtLow blowIs it? I see you comment more on climate studies from a contrarian position than I see you comment on musicologyrelated ones.

39742,0,t1_ceixvvu,Not depressing surprising. Dare I say kind of encouraging. Im black. Usually Im the one calling Reddit racist. Unfortunately blacks particularly working and underclass ones in America have to deal with a legacy of shitty genes caused by  years of slavery and intentional breeding government programs that encourage incarceration and poverty and recently the CIA shipping hard drugs into their neighborhoods for government profit. Blacks are more likely to be framed for a crime or caught engaging in illegal activity. They are more likely to be viewed suspiciously by police and the general public and watched or arrested because of it. Whites have also had these problems but not to the same extent. Let me be clear poor whites in this country have been sterilized by the government beaten down by the corporate world and worse. But they could always count on the fact that blacks had it worse. Lynchings are a testament to this where communities of poor whites vent their frustration by killing innocent blacks without much legal repercussion. Seeing the number of young white males being incarcerated go up to me means police may be doing their jobs better.EDIT Forgot something. This country makes money off of people being in prison. Before we made money off of factories making weapons for the world wars and before that it made money by growing cotton and tobacco. We live in a prisonindustrial complex in which prisons are built in blighted communities in rural areas providing jobs and all that. People from other blighted areas usually cities are arrested and given lengthy sentences and are shipped to these places where they provide essentially free labor making all manner of state materials from chairs to documents. The government needs people in prison. That in addition to what I posted above makes it reasonable to believe  of black males are incarcerated by . EDIT  Actually its really depressing. The number gap is smaller but both rates are higher. The government is getting more not less dependent on this fucked up system.,science,ceiyelm,4,t5_mouw

But if theyre getting proper nutrition from their food then supplements may not be necessary for them. TLDR Vitamins are extremely important. Source Farmer. Ive watched hundreds of new born animals and young animals die from vitamin deficiency. We started pumping them full of vitamins after realizing what was going on and havent lost a calf since. Except to coyotesEDIT For clarity the calves that died of deficiency were often born to new mothers and had to be hand raised. Artificial milk has nutritional value but at that age is not good enough on its own. Especially if the calf didnt get a proper dose of colostrum. Adding vitamins and minerals to that has helped us to eliminate any calf deaths from under feeding. ,science,cejikzn,27,t5_mouw

94281,0,t1_cep5suh,The problem arises immediately after an algae bloom.  There ends up being a massive amount of algae some of which dies and starts to decompose and some of which is consumed by zooplankton.  At this point theyve already removed all the CO from the water as well as other nutrients important to algae.  This is the point where oxygen levels get really low.  Also when algae die they start to sink in the ocean and they end up being decomposed by any bacteria there.  But bacteria use up oxygen too so they end up making the water anoxic.  Finally oxygen isnt that soluble in water so it tends to diffuse from the water to the atmosphere during an algae bloom.,science,cep5wyv,7,t5_mouw

Remember this discussion was prompted by the question Does East and West Antarctica make sense given they are at the pole?.

Drunk driving kills more than  people a year accounting for  of all traffic fatalities in .  Do you think that  of drivers are drunk at any given time?  Absolutely not.  Does that mean drunk drivers are responsible for a disproportionately higher number of traffic fatalities?  Absolutely.  To put that into perspective CJIS reports total firearm homocides for  at  which by simple numbers drunk driving is killing more people.Ultimately your whole angle makes little sense.  DUI laws unfairly target the poor?  I fail to see how.  Drunk drivers of every socioeconomic status are picked up and at the same time theyre killing thousands of people each year thats not a case of poor people being unfairly targeted.  This is a dangerous illegal activity that not only puts their own life but also the lives of others at risk and there are literally countless examples of that.Look at the recent Texas case that got lambasted for the affluenza defense where an  year old drunk driver killed  people and paralyzed another.

Clinical psychology makes exceptions for differences in cultural experience and when practiced well does not trample on what is basically a pretty normative human experience.  This is not to say that God is real or unreal questions of faith are by definition beyond the purview of science. If God is telling you to rip up every newspaper you see or is planting the thoughts of Julius Caesar in your brain that is another story. Calling religious experience delusional is pretty bush league and respects neither your position nor the profound seriousness of actual delusions.

Its not like Im shaving my butthole and I have to worry about fecal matter infecting a cut in my face.I am white. I keep the pubic area medium short with a pair of clippers. Same goes for my armpits. It looks good and all but I am more concerned with the fact that it prevents me from smelling like crotch all day. I sweat a good bit. The balls are the only part I shave and only on occasion. That I just do because it feels nice to hold them in your hand. FWIW Ive never gotten any kind of razor burn on the balls even though I often have it on my face when I shave.

The tether changes its orbit thanks to an electrical current flowing through the wires which creates an electromagnetic field that attracts the debris and pushes the net away from Earths geomagnetic field. This is in no way saying its maneuvered using earths magnetic field. It uses an electric current generated in the craft to maneuver the net and also uses electromagnetism to attract said debris.

170019,0,t1_cexrvmz,Black holes have had their definitions debated and explored for the better part of a century.  I mean RIndler Misner Thorne Wheeler and Weinberg just to name a few all wrote about the definition of black holes and the difficulty in creating a single definition or description that captures the entirety of the phenomenon.  That difficulty is what seems to give rise to the rather lay definition that a black hole is anything surrounded by an event horizon.  But most of the definitions actually used in theorems regarding black holes have more precise definitions such asgtAn asymptotically flat spacetime M is said to contain a black hole if not every point of M is contained in the causal past of future null infinity.And there is still great debate about the proper way to define them.  The point Im making is that the headline seems to be crafted for sensationalism and generating reaction rather than informing the reader as to the overall idea of the article.  Hawking isnt saying that the phenomena we know as black holes doesnt exist he is saying that our understanding and definition of them might need to be changed.  The headline could have read Hawking proposes new definition for black holes and it would be eminently more informative than your current title.I can pretty much guarantee that because of this headline someone at my next family get together is going to casually mention in conversation Hey I heard that black holes dont exist after all did you hear that?  Scientists just cant make up their mind. and Im going to have to explain how that isnt actually the case and thats the point of science etc etc etc.  So thanks nature youve preruined Thanksgiving for me.,science,cexsqsv,14,t5_mouw

This is truly basic statistics.So the way they calculated a  specificity is bullshit as far as I can tell. It looks like they took True Negative  All negative  . This calculation actually gives you the negative predictive value NPV of this test for suicide in a bipolar population. The NPV can be helpful in characterizing a test but should never be confused with the specificity and is highly dependent on the prevalence of suicide in the tested population  its not intrinsic to the test. Looking further in the paper they have this jewel of a linegtThe present computation evokes interesting theoretical issues regarding the interpretation of the concept of specificity. For example is the observed high raw specificity due to a low background frequency of suicides or to a high frequency of suicide preventing reactivity?There are no theoretical issues regarding interpretation of specificity they just calculated the NPV instead which is known to vary with prevalence or background frequency of the condition of interest.TLDR  Appalling misrepresentation of data either due to complete ignorance of basic stats or willful introduction of ambiguity to confuse reviewersreaders.,science,cexui7v,1,t5_mouw

Second the models cant be trusted if the models could not even predict the current  year pause. If they cant predict current conditions they certainly cant predict future conditions neither. if the models could be trusted they would have predicted the pause. They didnt and most Warmists with the exception of the two that have written books trying to explain away the pause are still in denial that we are even IN a pause. The fact that most Warmists do not even know anything about the current pause and live in denial of it is akin to a Young Earth Creationist position. I could go on and on. I am wellstudied on this topic since I was once the classic Warmist myself. But at some point you must follow the evidence where it leads NOT where you wish it was. Was there warming? Sure. Is there warming now? No. Are we following the knowntrend that occurs before collapsing into a miniiceage? Yes. Is the sun showing signs of the dormancy required for a miniiceage event to occur? Yes. Scientists went on the best data they had on the s and made predictions. Predictions that have not panned out. Its time they ate humble pie and admitted they were wrong something that is easy for any real scientist and begin investigating just how a miniiceage may impact us.

197187,0,t1_cf0w7e7,For a dumb question it sparked a lot of discussion with my colleague to try and get a good answer for you D. One of these universal truths we never actually questioned properly.  It has a bit to do with surface receptors which the bacteriophage binds to start an infection. Bacteria express different receptors depending on the state of the environment which may be for taking in nutrients or getting rid of waste etc. Some of these arent expressed when the bacteria detects that the environment has changed. Some bacteriophage propagation is improved by changing the bacterial growth media. Also when the bacteria are growing dividing and replicating they are actively undergoing DNA transcription which means that the phage DNA is actively transcribed instead of new proteins and this increases the growth rate of the bacteriophage. If a bacteria isnt undergoing DNA transcription then the bacteriophage DNA will just be in the cell doing nothing.   ,science,cf0wh5e,3,t5_mouw

212504,0,t1_cf2crus,Im going to change this quote to make it so that its something I can agree with.  Ala FTFYgt...recreational cannabis is primarily consumed because of the THC...Medical Cannabis is primarily consumed for CBD amp CBN.As for alcohol its yeast shit.  It is produced in the dark it is the result of yeast removing energy from a  molecule.  It is a single chemical molecule that is inaccessible with anything but the sugar amp grain it comes from.Cannabis is a plant that spends a year practically building these molecules by hand itself in the light.  THC without CBD CBN and others is not cannabis.gtAssociating THC with cannabis is not an unreasonable thing to do because its the only place you can find it outside of a laboratory.Heres the misnomer you are vectoring upon The same is true for CBD.  What distinguishes THC and Cannabis from Ethanol and alcohol is that there is nothing in any alcohol  that automatically comes hand in hand to prevent the worst effects of alcohol.Quite frankly Ive known too many kids whose parents smoked pot while they were gestating and grew up with remarkably greater intelligence.Its anecdotal Im not using this statement to prove anything.  Im using to explain why I refuse to take the results of this study to mean anything conclusive about cannabis use during pregnancy.  Its not Its a study about THC use during pregnancy.  Weve mountains of materials explaining why Marinol or the distribution of THC alone is a bad idea and puts users unnecessarily at risk for an issue Cannabis addresses.  With further scientific study I believe we will find this is not the only counterbalance effect the varity of cannaboids produced by cannabis.Studying THC alone as here helps us understand exactly what these other cannaboids are doing.  It doesnt tell us anything else about cannabis.TLDR The study of ethanolalcohol is incomperable to the study of Cannabis cocktail of cannaboids or any specifically isolated cannaboid.Alcohol is not a drug the same way other drugs are.  Alcohol is not a mimic for any nuerotransmitter.  Alcohol is a solvent.,science,cf2ndjq,2,t5_mouw

The gained energy is essentially coming from the sun so what youve got is a corn field acting as an extremely inefficient solar plant. Then you have all the gasoline and resources used to grow harvest and transport the corn. Then you take fairly major energy loses when converting corn to ethanol. In the end you might barely end up with more available energy than what was put in.Government intervention isnt hurting the ethanol market it created the ethanol market. Without government mandates and subsidies there is no way that ethanol could compete with fossil fuels.

261526,0,t3_1x3vv4,Article The observable signature of late heating of the Universe during cosmic reionizationAbstractgtModels and simulations    of the epoch of reionization predict that spectra of the centimetre transition of atomic hydrogen will show a clear fluctuation peak at a redshift and scale respectively that mark the central stage of reionization and the characteristic size of ionized bubbles. This is based on the assumption   that the cosmic gas was heated by stellar remnantsparticularly Xray binariesto temperatures well above the cosmic microwave background at that time about  kelvin. Here we show instead that the hard spectra that is spectra with more highenergy photons than lowenergy photons of Xray binaries  make such heating ineffective resulting in a delayed and spatially uniform heating that modifies the centimetre signature of reionization. Rather than looking for a simple rise and fall of the largescale fluctuations peaking at several millikelvin we must expect a more complex signal also featuring a distinct minimum at less than a millikelvin that marks the rise of the cosmic mean gas temperature above the microwave background. Observing this signal possibly with radio telescopes in operation today will demonstrate the presence of a cosmic background of hard Xrays at that early time.,science,cf7v6z7,2,t5_mouw

In order to create a star we would need to have so much hydrogen that the combined mass alone of the Hydrogen created enough gravity to initiate fusion. They say Jupiter is  Hydrogen and even that wasnt enough mass to become a star.Black holes are made by having so much mass that the escape velocity requried to exit the gravity well of the object is greater than the velocity of light itself. For this reason light doesnt escape. So.. I doubt any blackhole would come of it because we arent increasing mass to initiate the fusion reaction.

338196,0,t1_cffrvnq,As a statistician Im not entirely convinced of the value of effect sizes. Constant and mindless dependence on pvalues is definitely a problem but Im not sure effect sizes is really a meaningful solution. The problem is really at least three dimensional unless you are Bayesian and then you can reduce it to two dimensional. You need to assess the practical meaningfulness of the effect estimate e.g. the effect size the probability of seeing a similar result given the null is true p value and an estimate of the probability of the null being true. A Bayesian p value is interpretable as the probability of the null being true. Frequentists could calculate a p value adjusted for the likelihood of the null e.g. more likely to be true nulls require greater evidence against the null but that isnt going to happen. It really is a two dimensional problem at the very least. No scalar value will be able to determine both how big is my effect and how strong is my evidence. We need to stop trying to use scalars to do that. ,science,cfftoow,1,t5_mouw

Similarly a significant negative correlation was observed between apparent liver blood flow per unit volume of liver liver perfusion and age p less than .. The reduction in liver volume apparent liver blood flow and perfusion may at least partly account for the decline in the clearance of many drugs undergoing liver metabolism which has been noted to occur with aging in man.Age and alcoholgt Alcohol is more toxic in the ageing organism because of changes in its metabolism distribution and elimination which lead to central nervous system effects at lower levels of intake also ageing organs such as brain and liver are more sensitive to the toxicity of alcohol.Age and mindAlthough that link is not a study it references studies in the article.gt And behavioral interventions with animals such as training enrichment of the environment increased social interaction and simple physical exercise have increased neurogenesis in adult brains Gould et al. a Kempermann et al.  Kempermann et al.  van Praag et al. .ampnbspgt In older people positive effects on cognitive function have been reported in response to antioxidants and to behavioral interventions such as exercise and training e.g. Jama et al.

Schaie  Schaie  Willis Age and healinggt CONCLUSION In healthy humans aging leads to delayed epithelialization.gt ABSTRACT The aged patient is more susceptible to wound healing problems because of the interactions of body systems environmental stresses and disease with an aging process that takes place over many years.... Compared with a younger adult the aged patient generally heals well following the same healing process but at a slower rate. gt Our results show that the age of the patient is a very important factor for facial nerve recovery.Reduced recovery for traumautic brain injurygt This study supported our primary hypothesis that older patients show greater decline over the first  years after TBI than younger patients. In addition the greatest amount of improvement in disability was observed among the youngest group of survivorsCorrelation between age and speed of AIDS developmentgt Thus irrespective of exposure category a year increase in age at seroconversion was associated with a fold increase in the risk of death and a fold increase in the risk of developing AIDS excluding Kaposis sarcoma. For people with haemophilia the factors were slightly larger especially for mortality .... Mortality from liver disease in haemophilia patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus is higher than in those who are not coinfected and older age is a risk factor in liver disease progression. There is no evidence among individuals aged  years at seroconversion that the effect of age at seroconversion varies with time since seroconversion either for mortality or for development of AIDS.,science,cfgbc83,1,t5_mouw

355106,0,t1_cfhibgh,This is perhaps technically true as it could always be postulated that the very last remnants of an infection are always eliminated by the immune system rather than the antiviral drug but it is a theory that could basically never be tested since the hypothetical remnant infection is by definition undetectable.It is not true that no antiviral drugs can actually cure a viral infection however hepatitis C is the best example where treatment can lead to a cure in  of cases. There are viruses where our current best treatments cannot effect a cure HIV and herpes simplex being the most well known. This is because these viruses can latently infect a cell where the virus is present in some form in the cell but is not actively producing new viruses. Since most antiviral drugs target the replication process latent infections of this sort are extremely hard to treat.HPV has no latent phase so there is no reason to expect antiviral drugs would not be able to completely eliminate the infection if they are sufficiently potent.. Just to note the way latency works in these two viruses is completely different and the two should not be assumed to share any characteristics beyond the simple fact that they are not replicating. This form of latency should also not be confused with clinical latency in HIV infection or any of the other meanings of latency within virology. ,science,cfhknhr,21,t5_mouw

371877,0,t1_cfj8e5d,Any responsible scientist always considers the implications of their work  this is something weve discussed.One of the things Ive seen with optogenetics and how its discussed in the popular media is that there are always questions about misuse well intentioned ones that seem to rest upon science fiction style scenarios involving mind control or in this case noninvasive induction of pain. While I like a good scifi story as much if not more than the average person see my posts in rprintsf if youre curious what I like  I think these concerns are somewhat misplaced. Optogenetics is even by scientific standards a quite complex technique. There are many moving parts  you need to use viruses or transgenesis to induce opsin expression that requires surgery you typically though not here need implants which requires surgery too. Its not exactly subtle  you need constant high intensity light for most effects. If you have the ability to interact with a person for extensive periods of time and operate on them surely there are far worse things you can do than attempt to in the future maybe optogenetically control them. That seems somewhat inefficient.More seriously though whenever theres a new technique this sort of conversation is good and important. All Ill ask is that it be factually informed and take into account the intrinsic restrictions of the technique. In this case we believe and the scientific track record over the past  years backs this up that optogenetics will be used for great good and will help us understand much more about human disease and potentially have utility as a treatment. Though as Ive said frequently here thats a long long way away we have many challenges to cross before we get there. ,science,cfjb6o4,15,t5_mouw

Youre frustrated and annoyed. The person on the other end is being awkward and tries to avoid giving you the money back. You demand to speak to their manager. Youre not shouting at them but youre making a demand and youre serious about it. This is an authoritive tone of voice and its the tone you should use to command your dog.If youre struggling to envision it try comparing the sound of that voice versus the sound of your voice when you greet a friend or the voice you use when idly chatting to a coworker. Its about inflection not pitch.Another tip Id give when dealing with dogs is to straighten your spine. If youre sat or stood in a hunched or slouched position dogs pick up on it as a submissive or passive stance. If you straighten yourself up even when sat down your shoulders move higher and broader your head raises and you appear larger and more dominant. Dogs respond to that.,science,cfkw0kp,40,t5_mouw

390608,0,t1_cfl5k86,Amen to that!Right now Ive got a few extra pounds and Ill chalk that up to personal responsibility.  Translation  I love bread.  But twice in the past I gained weight to a point that I dont feel was healthy and it wasnt entirely my doing.  The first time I was injured and was prohibited from doing ANY exercise for about two months.  On top of that I lived in a damp apartment with a mold problem and that really screwed with my lungs for a while and I was getting sick a lot.  The second time I was working a very highstress highhours job and wasnt sleeping well and had little time to work out.  Plus as many of you know stress and lack of sleep really makes your body crave sugar amp carbs and leads to inflammation. The problems I had were really mild compared to what some people go through in their daily lives.  So I think its very important to acknowledge how privileged and also the design of many cities plays a role in obesity.  When I see how much time many of my friends and relatives in suburban and bigcity areas spend car commuting I think its a miracle any of them get decent exercise at all.  Those of us living in small towns amp metro areas with good public transit are very very lucky.  Those of us that can afford leisure time with which we can choose to work out or spend time on Reddit are also fortunate.  ,science,cfl93cz,1,t5_mouw

Theres a good chance Ill be a candidate for a replacement knee in another  years anyway.  My doctors suggested its best to stick to low impact cardio if the pain bothers me. But what is much more likely is as my doctor does if youre already physically active and still overweight  your doctor will shift the diagnosis from physical activity to your eating habits because if you are even moderately active   the real determination of whether youre gaining wait or losing it is your calorie intake. I know a few doctors that will take diets seriously including stuff thats all the rage right now like Keto but most PCPs and even most nutritionists were trained in the old school basics.

Along with the carbon tax a national sales tax based on the types of products purchased would help in moving from a consumption to a conservation economy will also have an impact on the type of goods and services we purchase. Well no longer buy the disposable products but buy things that will last for life or be easily repaired just to avoid paying the taxes again. Savings would increase and our economies would be less leveraged even though they would slow due to decreasing demand for goods.Global strategies like population control or a a global carbon tax besides being draconian infringe on sovereignty and disproportionally affect countries based on their wealth making a global consensus virtually impossible. Leave us the freedom to purchase what we want just give incentives through rearranging the tax structure to get us to want to purchase things that are good for the environment. My fear though is that the income tax wont go away and that a national carbon or sales tax would be implemented and end up hurting the economy further.

I certainly think he could be way off base with his timeline but my point is he sees a future where we become more than apes.  And he has dedicated his life to studying the technologies that will take us there.  Maybe hes overly optimistic but hes not pulling things out of his ass.  Many scientists and businessmen agree with him and Im personally excited to see what the next generation of scientists do with these coming technologies.  No we dont have flying cars and robots in every home yet but the futurists of the past didnt know where technology was going as well as we do now.  Now we can see the pace of robotics energy biotech and nanotech.  Theyre all in their infanttoddler phase now and many thought they would be further.  But they will most likely grow up fast.  The only way they will is by young people having a desire to become scientists instead of businessmen and sports stars.

526935,0,t1_cfzwh87,Sorry to correct you but the issue in Texas was over over scientific inaccuracies in a biology textbook favoring a bit heavyhandedly evolution.  You are probably doubly confusing it with the standard anti academicfreedom legislation rhetoric which claims that the legislation tries to push creationism when in reality it only allows for teachers to teach critical thinking skills when dealing with scientific topics like evolution. It even explicitly forbids teaching religion in science class. The Darwin lobby contiually tries to conflate intelligent design with creationism to try and paint intelligent design theorists as antiscience.  The reason books like this one or dawkins book encounter resistance to allow them in public schools is the same reason you wouldnt allow a creationist childrens book in public school it promotes a particular ideology namely materialismwhich is a central tenet of atheism. The state shouldnt be promoting any religion or irreligion in public schools. It is generally fine to teach about evolution in schools so long as you arent preaching it at students.

Wikipedia seems to suggest one thing Ringwoodite is notable for being able to contain water within its structure present not as a liquid but as hydroxide ions oxygen and hydrogen atoms bound together.  while  the referenced portion that leads to that statement in the wikipedia article  doesnt seem to suggest that at all.  It contains neither the term hydroxide  nor lattice bound OH references.   What it does state is  gtThe most hydrous ringwoodite could contain up to about  wt HO and gtHowever the relationship between HO content and its influence on various physical properties important to geophysical research relies on precise determination of HO concentrations in the crystal lattice. which have suffered from the absence of an absolute spectroscopic calibration for water content.Which seems to imply that it is not OH  hydroxide stored in the crystal structure  but in fact HO as a whole molecular structure.  I dont know if the author of the wikipedia article is incorrect or if my understanding of the constant reference to HO in the paper itself is misconstrued by the papers definition of HO as OH and not HO.  Feel free to explain what I may be missing here.  Edit  Additionally  this structure here it would appear that both distinct HO with Hydroxide bound at magnesium vacancies occurs in the crystal structure of Wadselyite another Olivine polymorph.       This suggests that it very well may be molecular water  HO.  nd edit  I accidentally replied here instead of to  sorry for any confusion this may have caused.,science,cg3khwq,1,t5_mouw

In my opinion this is not an adequate measure of intelligence on the human scale. Other studies on IL from over a decade ago have already shown a correlation between IL and memory and plasticity.

This article is about a level  multiverse which is the idea that individual universes sprang forth from cosmic inflation in areas where inflation slowed down forming a bubble in which we exist. Think of a block of swiss cheese. Each of these bubble universes are distinct physical entities and would have distinct laws of physics.Then there is also a level  multiverse which is based around the idea of the hubble volume the bubble of our universe we are capable of observing which is about  million light years across.

591340,0,t1_cg6zra1,I want to make sure I am understanding you correctly. You are suggesting we make corn more expensive to produce than it is now in order to make it more similar in price to other produce thereby making it so less people eat it as often? While that would work why would you want to? Dont lose sight of the fact that much of our soy and corn goes to industrial use and it is not all food. Sure corn flakes are cheap but  of what is in our gas tank comes from crops like corn. Soybeans are used for more than I can keep track of due to their high oil content. And both corn and soy are used for feedlots. My point is that decreasing productivity of these commodities would hurt other industries because human consumption of them is just a fraction of what they are grown for. And on a side note be careful of how much of the local produce kool aid you are drinking. I would argue that the claims it is tastier are unsubstantiated and is what organic companies would like you to believe to shell out more money for it. A tomato is a tomato whether it is grown in your backyard or in Mexico. What makes a plant more tasty is how well it grows and how much care has been taken of it which can happen even from far away. Usually the local growers are trying to fill a niche of higher quality produce but the higher quality is not directly related to distance traveled. Do you see what I am saying? For example we buy bananas from all over the world and as far as I am concerned those are pretty dang tasty. I would say that if you are really concerned about emissions then local produce can be beneficial. But beyond that is just some Whole Foods marketing to make you spend more for produce IMHO,science,cg7hmav,1,t5_mouw
591461,0,t3_20vur1,Population isnt a problem  the problem is resource consumption and weve all been convinced that population growth is the driving factor. Think about it though  population is booming in developing nations where resource consumption per capita is minimal. Then compare that to resource consumption in developed nations like the US and Europe. It isnt kids in Kinshasa that are driving SUVs and feeding growing demand for industrial agriculture. In both the US and India  of food is wasted although at different times on the farm to fork chain which means huge amounts of water fuel chemicals labor and time are thrown away while people are malnourished.

592217,0,t1_cg7f2yr,gtYes it can because science works. Planes fly we go to the moon we send robots to Mars we cure diseases and makes faster computers all using science. Try doing any of that without employing the scientific method and see how well it works.This is not how something validates itself. Some clarification around the terms being used here before proceeding A proposition is valid IFF it is true when it logically follows from its premises. When somebody believes a proposition this means that they hold that the proposition is discretely true A proposition is valid but also false unsound if it logically follows from its premises but the premises are falseAll methods of scientific enquiry are at a fundamental level either probabilistic all apples I have observed so far are red therefore it is likely that all apples are red or axiomatic all apples I have observed so far are red and it is true that if for all known X Y then X is Y therefore all apples are red.Probabilistic methods of enquiry do not infer that their explanations for things are true. For example claiming that it is true that the Earth revolves around the Sun because it probably does is logically invalid.Axiomatic methods of enquiry are valid  from the premises it is true that all apples are red. However at least one premise must be assumed to be true. One must believe that this premise is true without logical justification in order to claim that these methods lead to true explanations of descriptions of things.Why is science works not adequate justification for belief? Because in order for you to claim that it is true that science works you must make an axiomatic argument. Which requires you to assume that the axiom you are trying to justify is already true. You have to believe the axiom is true without justification in order to obtain justification for it  circular reasoning. This is known as the problem of induction.So all existing forms of the scientific method are not selfvalidating.,science,cg7l7l1,2,t5_mouw

598212,0,t1_cg8302b,gtThe problem is that many vaccines arent just for the person getting them. Quite right! I would argue that no modern immunization program has the primary objective of protecting the individual that is an added secondary benefit. The primary objective is to protect the entire community by reducing the population level attack rate by hampering the ease of transmission through the network that is each community. Analogy You can think of society as a graph with each node being a person and each edge connection being a relationship or routine contact. The pathogen travels along these edges from one susceptible individual on to the next. Lets pretend this is a board game to simplify the analogy. The pathogen only gets a few rounds on each node it infects they either die or recover. It has to move on quickly so it rolls a dice to see if it jumps to the next person never  transmission and can attack multiple times per node per term but it only gets a set number of outbound attempts for each node basic reproductive number. If it doesnt move on to at least one new node it dies.Now imagine a moderately effective vaccine is developed that reduces the likelihood that any one node acquires the illness once exposed by . Every time the pathogen tries to jump from susceptible to susceptible it rolls the dice but now has an added  chance of automatic failure.Now imagine two graphs of m nodes each only one of which has m nodes got this vaccine. While it doesnt sound like much at first when you imagine the graph you can get some idea of how incredibly effective the vaccine is at the population level. It slows the pathogens spread through the network incredibly and in cases where the basic reproductive number is low in our analogy attempts to spread the pathogen can be entirely eliminated and lose the game Smallpox Polio in the West.In short Herd immunity is the primary goal and offers far more protection than the effects of an individual vaccine. No vaccine is near  effective flu vaccines are usually  effective but mass immunizations are amazingly effective.Those who say they dont need a flu vaccine because they are young and will easily survive the flu are missing the entire point. Ironically new research has shown that due to their higher contacts per day centrality on the graph young folks should be first to get the flu vaccine even if they are least at risk themselves. A paper I saw recently showed that an old person who gives their vaccine to a school age child in their family is more protected by that action than they would be by taking the vaccine themselves.Source MPH in infectious diseases working on PhD in computational modeling of epidemics.,science,cg89qqj,8,t5_mouw

605018,0,t3_211i4y,This is happening because we live in a society that values hierarchy a bit more than knowledge. Several ways that has impacted research and decisionmaking in research in general scholars publish more instead of less e.g. the common publish or perish more papers providing information or observation rather than expanding knowledge this ties in with publish or perish gatekeepers in journals that promote  demote work based on affiliation funding is similarly structured gatekeeper structure  affiliation made explicit and enforced through awarding fellowship e.g. Fellow of some societyWhile some of these e.g. fellowship enable people to quickly recognize a likely contributor of knowledge the way it has been developed over the years has basically reduced it to a gatekeeper state where just industrial or funding affiliation will get you in not meritorious but political.A way to break this hierarchical structure is to cooperatively set up a dual tree of knowledge and information where every scholar can apply their efforts in an objective peerreviewed way and see where their contribution is in the greater context. There are many advantages to this approach We can observe research areas that are clearly undeveloped more gains are made where theres a larger gap in understanding instead of following everyone else Knowledge is accumulated objectively independent of any journal society etc. We can clearly distinguish the development of key branches from evolutionary progress instead of depending on the opinions of gatekeepers of research societies Emphasizes the research of key results instead of more data data  information while valuable is not of the same quality as testable validated widelyapplicable theories this also promotes less but better writing instead of profligate writing.,science,cg91l73,4,t5_mouw

Here it is in a nut shellI went to a casino to meet up with a friend of mine who deals poker. While I was waiting for him to get off from work I went to the bar and ordered one glass of wine. At some point I must have made the rookie mistake of looking away from my drink. Time frames are fuzzy but I ended up being totally smashed and talking to several guys asking me to join them on their party bus. I guess somewhere in my the back of my head I still realized I had an obligation to my friend so I excused myself from my new friends and went to him. In an attempt to shorten this up my friend saw how smashed I was and made sure I got home safely. It was later confirmed by the bartender that I did only have one glass of wine.

There are aircraft assisted rockets pegasus but those are limited in payload capacity and currently can only achieve Low Earth Orbit.Edit  Also you could possibly use a slightly smaller rocket but it is still a full fledged rocket.  Even though you might be able to get by with less rocket it still requires all the parts and consideration of a full sized rocket.  Thus the cost is almost equivalent from that perspective.  Then you add in the complexity of the aircraft.  The aircraft would have to be modifieddesigned explicitly for the purpose of launching rockets into orbit.  Its very likely that you would want the aircraft to be unmanned as the safety considerations would be daunting to say the least.All this said I think the low end launch cost to launch a satellite on the Pegasus is about  Million dollars.,science,cgjsxbb,2,t5_mouw

708665,0,t1_cgkcdxi,gt remember that an equivalent to FGM is cutting off the head of the penisYawn. That old number.Homology vs NeurologyIn order to understand this subject fully you can really benefit from a complete and comprehensive dissemination of the structure function and  anatomy of the male and female genitalia and the associated medical and scientific research in these matters.Watch this great video. Totally professional and insightful. Amazing. So much great knowledgeKen McGrath Senior Lecturer in Pathology at the Faculty of Health Auckland University of Technology and Member of the New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Scientists discusses his research into the neural anatomy of the human penis and the physical damages caused by circumcision.McGrath is author of The Frenular Delta A New Preputial Structure published in Understanding Circumcision A MultiDisciplinary Approach to a MultiDimensional Problem Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Genital Integrity Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights in the st Century held December   in Sydney Australia.Abstract Textbooks and papers referring to penile function state that the source of penile sensation is solely the glans and often justify the existence of the prepuce by stating it protects the sensitive glans. These statements are contrary to the neuroanatomical and physiological facts accumulated over more than a century. This study reviews the findings of Taylor et al. that the prepuce is the primary sensory platform of the penis and describes a new preputial structure.This interview was taped in Berkeley California ....and from the Global Survey of Circumcision HarmRemoval of the male foreskin and the female clitoral hood female foreskin are anatomically equivalent. However neurologically speaking removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the external glans clitoris is for females. This video discussion of penile and foreskin neurology explains why. Contrary to popular Western myth many circumcised women do report the ability to feel sexual pleasure and to have orgasm albeit in a compensatory manner that differs from intact women suggested reading Prisoners of Ritual by Hanny LightfootKlein. Similar compensatory behaviours for achieving orgasm are at work among circumcised men who must rely on the remaining  or less of their penile nerve endings. Just as clitoridectomized girls grow up not knowing the levels of pleasure they could have experienced had they been left intact so too are men circumcised in infancy unaware of the pleasure they could have experienced had they not had  of their penile skin removed. The above video also explains whats really behind the erroneous comment made by some circumcised men that they couldnt stand being any more sensitive..Heres how the penis and the clitoris both develop separately from the genital tuberThe male foreskin and female clitoral hood are anatomically equivalent but equivalent is an everyday way of explaining it. The proper term is homology.In the context of sexual differentiationthe process of development of the differences between males and females from an undifferentiated fertilized eggthe male and female organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue. A typical example is the ovaries of female humans and the testicles of male humansSo the clitoris and penis may be said to be homologous and the same can be said of the foreskin and clitoral hood. But that does not mean they have the same function or scale. For instance the male foreskin in a adult is around  to  square inches in size whilst the female clitoral hood is much much smaller. An analogy can be made to male and female breast tissue as both are homologous. But of course female breast tissue is much much larger than male breast tissue and the female breasts have multiple important functions.You cannot really equate amputation of male breast tissue with amputation of female breasts.Also please do remember that the clitoris is a very large organ most of which is internal to the female.The visible part  the glans clitoris  is only a small part of the whole clitoris. So when a woman suffers partial or total amputation of the external clitoris when undergoing the crime of FGM only a small part of her clitoris is removed.You can read a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the foreskin here. This relies on research in the British Journal of UrologyForeskin Sexual FunctionCircumcision Sexual DysfunctionBritish Journal of UrologyFinetouch pressure thresholds in the adult penisMale circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohortConclusion What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the male? The foreskin with its  nerve endings. What is the most sensitive part of the external genitalia of the female? The glans clitoris with its  nerve endings. Hence Ken McGraths conclusion neurologically speaking removal of the male foreskin is as destructive to male sexual sensory experience as removal of the clitoris is for females.,science,cgktu6j,3,t5_mouw

759256,0,t1_cgqkcl8,Sure.  For the sake of simplicity lets say there are only three groups of people in the world raw material producers chemical producers and consumers that use chemicals.The raw material producers and chemical producers come to an agreement about a price to purchase raw materials.  This is set by the supply and demand of raw materials and the produced chemicals  i.e. the market price.  The chemical producer comes to an agreement with consumers on a price to sell its chemicals to consumers in the same way.The chemical producer buys the raw materials to produce chemicals but in the process emits SO a major component in acid rain.  Acid rain is known to damage buildings reduce crop yields etc.  These costs are quantifiable by consumers and will ultimately get reflected in market price for goods.  Perhaps not immediately but over time they will become known.However what about costs that are more difficult to quantify?  What about the fact that acid rain can reduce biodiversity over time which could affect our ability to source new antibiotics for example?  How about acidification of oceans known for killing off coral and fish?  Acidification of arable land that slowly reduces our ability to produce food?  This is what I meant by environmental costs.I would argue that environmental costs are  real costs borne by society in general  not easily discoverable via the normal price mechanism of supply and demand and  borne by third parties outside the economic transaction.  The raw material producer and the chemical producer do not agree on a price that is artificially higher to offset ocean acidification as that cost is borne by others not the parties to the transaction.In order for the true price of environmental costs be borne by parties in an economic transaction I see a legitimate need for government to impose a pollution cost adder to the transaction that would offset the environmental cost of the pollution emitted.Hopefully I articulated my point well enough!,science,cgql16v,18,t5_mouw
759299,0,t1_cgqkx90,gtI believe the term or method of statistical analysis to be flawed in favor of researcher opinion rather than actual fact. I know there are exceptions and if used fairly and correctly it is a wonderful process. The problem is that the only way for it be  effective is to use  of all info on the subject over all time. This is obviously impossible and so the info used is up to the researchers discretion. Its an easy way to skew results.It would be an easy way to skew results if these things happened in a vacuum. If you were just talking about one guy doing statistical analysis in his basement for himself then yes he could prove whatever he wants. But your discussion of the problems leaves out every check and balance on research and then damns the type of research. Collaboration the scientific community standards and peer review all keep the kinds of things you worry about from happening. They keep the badbiased analyses from getting published.

774721,0,t1_cgs8gwi,gt the nuance on how firm should we really make our convictions in certain areas.I would focus here on the in certain areas part of your perspective. First note the context or area where I made my statement about never changing my mind. My statement related to how science works and whether or not science proceeds strictly based on experimentation and analysis of data or whether politics enters into the process of science too. So the issue becomes whether we can have a high degree of certainty in that area.I maintain that my direct observations about how science works provide sufficient evidence to me personally for me to say with conclusive certainty that politics plays a highly significant role in the process of science and science does not proceed based only on experimentation and analysis of data. I work as a scientist. I know how science works from my first hand experience and direct first person observations. I see this as on the order of trying to convince me that the Sun does not cause daylight. Think about where the funding for most science comes from. Although some very significant science happens with very little funding a great deal of science can only proceed by convincing people to fund the research. Important advances in science can suffer tragic delays all due to the political resistance of people who have no related expertise with respect to the decision making power they have over the resources required to fund the research. Science does not proceed in a political vacuum either. Watson and Crick felt driven to work on the double helix partly because of their political aspirations about who would get credit for making the discovery. Hooke claimed that he deserved credit for Newtons inverse square law of gravity. A letter Einstein wrote to Roosevelt played at least a small role in the process of science related to what we know today about the physics of the atom.,science,cgsc96k,4,t5_mouw

Its only measurable fact is the amount of money you waste to get high to do the things you used to enjoy sober or perhaps doing nothing at all. Whats immeasurable is your old self slipping away ever so slowly being replaced by a new version of yourself riddled with the symptoms that Marijuana introduces to you over the course of years. Slowly you go from confident to paranoid. Slowly you change from well versed to barely able to recall the words you used everyday. Slowly you see weed take more and more of a priority over the things that you used to feel were important. Slowly your social relationships wash away as your priorities shift. Ive seen this drug destroy people Ive never seen it build anyone up.

The problem is that when MOGS is messed with liked knocked down with siRNA the good glycosylation events that are critical to the cell are prevented as well as those necessary for virus replication. I think the hope here would be that delivery could be targeted to a particular tissue and cease before that tissue is completely destroyed like radiation for cancer treatment. These kids being alive demonstrates that the line where the tissue is destroyed can potentially be moved far further back than what we previously thought.

789263,0,t1_cgtweia,The short answer is that an increase in entropy does not immediately equate to the loss of information. The problem with information loss in black holes actually has nothing to do with an increase in entropy. Rather it has to do with a decrease. When you have the option of sending a zero or a one into a black hole that is an entropy of one bit. But according to Hawking after it is caught inside of the black hole then there is no uncertainty left because the black hole is the same whether it swallowed the zero or the one. This is such a bad violation of everything we know that it simply cannot happen this is the thought that started me on this entire journey.

For example In a recent report titled Indications of anomalous heat energy production in a reactor device containing hydrogen loaded nickel powder and published on arXiv G. Levi and coworkers put forth several claims concerning the operations and performance of the socalled ECat of inventor Andrea Rossi. We note first of all that the circumstances and people involved in the test make it far from being an independent one. We examine the claims put forth by the authors and note that in many cases they are not supported by the facts given in the report. We present results from thermal calculations showing that alternative explanations are possible were the authors seem to jump to conclusions fitting preconceived ideas. In general we find that much attention is drawn to trivialities while important pieces of information and investigation are lacking and seem not to have been conducted or considered. We also note that the proposed claims would require new physics in not only one but several areas. Besides a coldfusion like process without production of any radiation also extreme new material properties would be needed to explain what rather seems to be a problem of correct measurement. Therefore it is clear to us that a truly independent and scientific investigation of the so called ECat device convincingly demonstrating an anomalous heat energy production has not been presented in the arXiv report and is thus todate still lacking,science,cgy5p1w,1,t5_mouw

OGlcNAc transferase OGT which adds OGlcNAc to proteins and OGlcNAcase removes.  Contrast that to phosphatases and kinases which have hundreds if not thousands of different enzymes.  If you want to truly manipulate a cell and address metabolic abberations many DNA transcriptional events and virtually all intracellular signaling cascades that are out of whack targeting OGT or OGlcNAcase would be a very attractive idea.  The OGlcNAc modification is likely one of the best explanations of how altered metabolic states can lead to global wide perturbations of all cellular function.  Hell not only is the OGlcNAc modification involved with regulation of virtually all intracellular proteins and signaling cascades the OGlcNAc modification is also an essential part of the histone code and heavily regulates many aspects of epigenetics. This is why I say I put all my money on the idea that major diseases will be most properly characterized as metabolic problems when metabolism through carbohydrates is such a powerful regulator of virtually all cellular events down to the genetic level.  ,science,cgyr3ef,3,t5_mouw

Im not against it of course I would even like it to just end already instead of having to be stuck for  years until marijuana gets semiglobally legalized but i think completely legalizing it will increase its use specially in the long run considering how it will be less and less of a tabu with the yearsI think we shouldnt use wether its consumption will rise or drop as an argument to legalize it trying to use the argument that its consumption will go down if its legalized is admitting it is bad and I dont think its bad so I personally dont say but if we legalize it less people will use it to convince people who are against its consumption that legalization is a good thing.Finally the people who do this studies have said it time after time. Its hard to hit the right spot in this massive population scans a lot of consumers say that they dont consume any drugs at all and its just hard to actually measure consumption rates.

867864,0,t3_24282k,So one of my majors is Nuclear Engineering and I was kind of skeptical of some of the claims in this article. For example I have never heard of laboratory experiments where resistance to radiation is increased. It takes more dosage over longer periods of time to see effects but that is because the cells heal themselves over time.Anyway I just want to point out how little radiation we are actually talking about. From the article the dosage rates go as high as . microSieverts per hour. This is . Sieverts per year. Now the NRC limit looked up here for workers in the nuclear industry is less than . mSv per year and this is supposed to be a pretty safe limit. The birds were only exposed to  times that at the most so it was probably a lot less. My impression is that the birds arent really adapting just that the radiation levels around Chernobyl has been decreasing and is now at relatively safe levels compared to older studies. It doesnt properly cite previous studies though so its hard to speculate what kind of radiation fields the old studies took place in.,science,ch2xitz,2,t5_mouw

I think its a valid conceptual framework that we can debate about but its not going to be like okay at  on May th we hit singularity now we dont know wtf is going on. For one technology isnt a singular entity if the singularity theory is correct we should expect singularity to occur at different times in different fields. Also it fails to take into account the nature of technological advances  its not a smooth curve its closer to a series of punctuated equlibria. Singularity may best be imagined as a shortening of the time between equilibria  but how short? A month between significant advances? A week? A day? Finally he ignores economics entirely even if singularity were to deliver us huge advances like artificial bodies and fusion power and HalfLife  it takes time to engineer produce and distribute these wonderful new things.The economic objection is actually pretty serious. At some point after we pass the cusp of the theoretical Curve of All Technology it will become clear that were in a time of technological deflation. At that point incentives to deliver innovations to the public dramatically decrease. Why spin up even a totallyultraadvanced ubernanofabricator line to make the iPhone  when Android phones will significantly outpace you next month?

But much of the complexity that you keep referring to is not there in the simplest life and according to the theory of evolution developed in later generations.

It explains why though they are outwardly similar squid and human eyes function quite differently. On to point two Fine. Anthropocentric. Finally their experiment was designed to provide evidence for a hypothesis. Sure they mixed things together with an end in mind. That end was to show that what they thought might happen would. They had to do the experiment to see what would happen. The designed the experiment to have the best chances of that but they didnt control the phase partitioning of the solutions or membranes.

Everyone has CXCR receptors but CD subjects express more of these receptors which is apparently hereditary. Youre right that generic markers of inflammation or immunoresponse have yet to be identified that are applicable to all people.  CD patients have an immunoresponse to alphagliadin by definition but some people have an immunoreponse to betagliadin gammagliadin omegagliadin or to WGA wheat germ agglutinin.  Letting in a flood of random polypeptides into the bloodstream cant be good and which markers the body decides are nonself might just be random. I think markers that indicate generic inflammation or immunoresponse in wheat sensitive people will be found soon though Im also guessing theyll be food antigen specific eg wheatpotatoes causes response to solanine wheatapples causes response to Mal d  etc.It could also be that microbiome affects the immune response.

Their word on a good day before Katrina should be taken with a grain of salt. But with Katrina remember that one of the highest ranking members of the NOPD was so exhausted that he admitted to reporting any rumor of rape that could get the feds involved.Meanwhile the police during Katrina were repeatedly brought up as some of the most appalling bit of chickenshit desertion opportunistic looting violence brought out by paranoia and just plain thuggery.

Look up the lipid hypothesis and recent reversals on the dangers of salt changes in what is considered to be a safe exposure to acetaminophen to start. Then when you look up rbgh  ask yourself how trustworthy and agency is that says We know this  hurts cows are not sure if it hurts humans yet so drink away until we find science that answers the question to our satisfaction.The available evidence shows that the use of rBGH can cause adverse health effects in cows.

The title of the article focuses on withdraw symptoms from exercise while the article spends its entire time discussing exercise addiction.As someone who exercises a lot let me say there are withdraws. I put in about  hours a week between gym and personal run training. When I have to take time off for something like injury I typically go through a variety of mental responses. First my mind tells me that my body is getting weaker even though there has not been significant time to become weak. Then my body tell me I am gaining weight even though the scale and eating habits would be to the contrary. Sometime in there I become depressed for a few days followed by anger and frustration at my inability to work out like I want to. Often I find myself coming back into my routine far before I am actually rehabilitated and I lie and tell myself things like I will just force my body to be healthy by abusing it harder than before. For instance last time I had tendonitis I started rehab while still in pain telling myself I would make the tendon stronger even though there is no possible way to strengthen a tendon...which I knew.I wish the article would of talked about stuff like that instead of just putting in some tiny blurb about how its like alcohol withdraw which it isnt and honestly I feel like spits in the face of true rehabilitated alcoholics.,science,chnlypv,4,t5_mouw

We would take turns one person reads the particle and the other changes its spin in a binary series that spells out letters.Remember that these spin states are entangled to each other regardless of distance.

Whether or not its desirable or possible or feasible to combat global warming has nothing to do with the measurements and the predictions.The idea that the science is political in nature is one of the biggest deceptions that has been created in this sphere. The science tells you what has happened what is happening and what is likely to happen  hell the IPCC report uses multiple different future emissions scenarios so that we can have predictions under a range of different progression cases.It makes zero sense to respond We dont have the money for this when someone tells you Global average temperatures have risen by X degrees over preindustrial levels and will likely rise Y degrees over the next century in scenario Z. Its like me saying Gravity at the Earths surface is .ms and someone responding But that means we need too much fuel to make this plane cost efficient. Im sure it does but it doesnt have any impact on the facts.When I look at temperature records and glacier mass balance data I dont stop to ask whether the results are going to be consistent with what my government wants to spend on countering the effects. That would be tremendously corrupt. I look at the best possible representation I have of the reality because thats what science is.

Whether this is due to the exposure or confounders is another question. People living on farms are quite a bit different than those living in the inner cities in many ways. This can be social status like education income etc. They certainly differ in how aware they are of certain things like allergies. So far it is questionable how much of the farming effect is environmental. I think few would dispute that exposure to roach and mouse allergens in the city is corellated to social status and quality of housing which are of course strongly corellated themselves.

What supporting structuresorganelles do you think would be necessary to allow the introduction of Nostoc into other plants?  You might be far too early in your research to be able to address such a question but as a synthetic biologist myself I have been fascinated by the idea of developing synthetic organelles in order to isolate a complex reaction.As you look at the relationship between Azolla and Nostoc please try to define what type of relationship they have and for what reasons it might be symbiotic.  What benefit does the Nostoc receive from being housed inside Azolla?  Lastly how can I follow your research?

1185301,0,t1_ci2y85t,Azolla will grow anywhere as long as the climate is temperate to hot. It doesnt do well in winter but it can stand moderate amounts of heat particularly when it has established itself. In my experience the azolla takes about a week to settle into a new climate before going into fullreproduction mode. In many places you have to understand that this is an invasive species. Once it gets a hold of your body of water good luck getting it out. It can be considered a pest but at the same time if you use it and cultivate it in a manmade reservoir for agricultural purposes it can be a godsend. You can save a lot of money by using it as partial substitution for your feed and as long as your pond is moderately large enough you can take quite large amounts of it out of the water without harming the reproduction.Imagine this  azolla is so damn prolific that it will literally overgrow its pond and turn to mulch on itself because the azolla quantity is so great. In certain environments you can easily scoop off an inch off the surface of the pond and get nothing but azolla. There are a few caveats to growing it but heh do you really need a manual for growing one of the worlds most invasive species? ,science,ci2yrcs,15,t5_mouw

It is racist to classify intelligence by skin color.    These kids who are black are only lower intelligence because their parents failed them their skin color means nothing.

Those that say skin color has an effect on academic achievement are racist.    I lived in a nice middle class area growing up where there were almost no welfare users since there were major steel mills with well paying jobs and lots of people with college degrees commuting to jobs in chicago.  I had several black friends all with parents who had college degrees and good jobs.  None of them had any academic achievement problems based on skin color.  My one black friend was tied for  out of  in our grade.  He got full rides to any college.  Everyone else also went to college.    Also in  it is very easy to be a black child in the US for advancement.  If you have decent grades you can automatically get into all prestigious states schools and get it all paid for.  There is no excuse for any achievement gaps based on skin color.    Even my friend who was ranked number  got grants based on skin color when his parents were a rich lawyer and a doctor who were both black.  not joking about this at all it was fucked up that someone so rich could get free money based on skin color.

1230876,0,t1_ci834nr,Insulin makes you hungrier but it doesnt make you eat more. You still have to make the choice. Once you eat more your body stores the excess as fat no matter what form of calorie it came from. Ketosis probably helps at breaking down fat for weight loss while at a calorie deficit but the primary function is still to eat less.The psychological component is not hunger itself but your reaction to hunger. A thin person is regularly hungry but they often learned at a young age to accept it and move on. Many fat people I know have no concept of what it means to feel passively hungry for most of a day because they are used to eating constantly. Keto satisfies the fullness thing so that you dont have to psychologically deal with hunger and thats fine and dandy but dont act like youve discovered some sort of calorie magic.,science,ci83a9e,1,t5_mouw

I cant even begin the exaggerations and blatant lies that people use in these job interviews much worse than in Western countries. cant speak for Korea and ChinaThis means that the article only speaks for minorities in the US and it is possible that this cultural modesty is in fact partly a projection that came forward from discrimination. The question here is if the attitude of the interviewers didnt affect the Asian applicants to be more modest. I see this as something that happens in society rather than just this studyBecause the article is behind a pay wall I cant read it completely but all I see is that Asians did worse in interviews. Then they moved away from the discrimination thesis Which Occams razor would prefer and decided to pin it on them being more modest.

Still that is a huge drop in a single generation definitively suggestive of an environmental factor. If the population selection and the statistics were stringent enough I have to admit that T levels may play a significant role in obesitiy. The problem I have with these kind of correlation studies especially when applied to a problem like obesity or cancer is that they are taken out of context by popular media. These problems are largely the result of a multitude of converging factors and no single factor alone can give rise to them.Point being that while Im willing to concede that hormone levels may play a role in obesity I still think there are a large number of public health initiatives directed at modifiable behavioral factors that would have a more meaningful impact in the current obesity problem. Most people with weight problems cant just blame hormonal imbalancesat least not at the onset since morbid obesity affects the endocrine system.

The message of the study aligns pretty well with the evidence that multitasking degrades task performance across the board. gt ... regardless of whether a quiz on the material immediately followed the lecture or took place after a week the penandpaper students performed better. The act of typing effectively turns the notetaker into a transcription zombie while the imperfect recordings of the pencilpusher reflect and excite a process of integration creating more textured and effective modes of recall.I take it these results are in a sense stronger than those of the Michigan State study in question since they are not restricted to the effects of nonacademic use of laptops.,science,cichq7g,20,t5_mouw

1274437,0,t1_cicnrhr,gtIm not sure what you mean here. We all share a common ancestor with the organism that evolved to be conscious. I meant that if your idea is that consciousness sorta just came along as a byproduct of some other trait that is adaptive if thats what your saying then if the trait evolved more than once through multiple pathways then presumably some people might have evolved without qualia. But yeah a lot would hinge on what trait were talking about I would guess and I admit Im way out of my depth in this line of speculation. My main point is that if qualia are epiphenomenal then it strikes me as weird that all typically developingnonbrain injured humans have it. gtThat being said there are numerous examples where humans dont gtexperience consciousness or qualia. Right but in the cases of brain damage from what I know people are still able to function reasonably well largely because the relevant experienceslearning were laid down prior to injury. I think people are still able to learn new thingsform new memories without subjective experience but I dont recall if their functioning is limited in virtue of lack of qualia. It would be interesting to find out actually. Hard to imagine feeling motivated to do anything if you dont actually subjectively feel anything! That said some feeling could be subconscious.And re fetuses sleep and comas despite outward appearances and lack of memory I think its very difficult to say that those states involve a complete lack of experience. gtI agree with you that consciousness is ubiquitous in life with varying complexity from very simple to very complex. I wonder if consciousness itself is not fundamentally dissimilar just substantially gtmore complex than far more simple and primitive physical forces that atoms and chemicals abide by. Have you read about panpsychism? Its the philosophical view that mind is a fundamental aspect of reality. Leibniz was a notable panpsychist. Dualaspect monadism is the idea that the basic stuff of reality is both mental and physical depending on ones perspective subjective vs. objective. Pretty cool and fun to think about. Thomas Nagel discussed it in his recent book and although he doesnt support the view he offers some pretty good criticisms of the materialist world view. There is also a nice review of panpsychist thinking through out time called Panpsychism in the West. Some parts are dry but the last sections of the book review some interesting and some wacky panpsychist ideasarguments by scientists physicists and biologists.gtBut I dont think the fact that we feel these sensations pain the gtfeelings of agency or choice etc necessarily implies that these mental events have an effect on their predicate causes or primary phenomenon.Youre right they dont imply that but they suggest it. I know there is research indicating that people show signs of making choices before they are consciously aware that they have and I think these findings are valid. Not everything has to be conscious but I suspect that without subjective experience wed be a lot less effective and productive in life Unfortunately for us some degree of anxiety seems to be a great motivator. And then theres the flip side  people whove experienced too much pain in life and the dysfunctionality that results.,science,ciczpct,1,t5_mouw

1321851,0,t1_ciibnoj,Good question. Not directly no. My guess only a guess would be that they look at something like police reports or accident reports or breathalizers or blood work when available to determine the degree to which these incidents occur in the presence of alcohol. In other words how many car accidents occur where someone had alcohol in their system? How many murders occur when someone was drunk? Etc.But also note that your inference that without booze that ALL of those alcohol related incidents would go away doesnt follow. Just because alcohol is involved doesnt mean alcohol caused it.Alcohol certainly increases the likelihood of all of those but removing it wouldnt have removed all of those murders etc. Some would have happened without the person being drunk its that the alcohol might have pushed them over the edge.,science,ciibpwg,20,t5_mouw

Feel better! Think positive! etc. are what do not work.That said I understand that  experience makes you feel  emotion Have you thought about it from  perspective and things like that help.In the end people who are hurting want above all to feel like they are understood and that what they are feeling isnt wrong per se.

1387033,0,t1_ciq4132,gtIs it accurate to define gene in a recursive manner such as this? A gene is a scientific definition of gene or a mutation of a gene.This is a good place to start. A gene is nothing more than a series of nucleotides genes can be coding or noncoding here we are interested in coding genes. Coding genes are those series of nucleotides which are used to determine the order of monomers in a peptide or nucleic acids in a nucleic acid molecule. You may recall from intro biology classes that our range of nucleic acids for this discussion consist of A T C and G.Hypothetical geneA has a specific nucleotide sequence ATATAT  this sequence codes for a portion of a polypeptide. It is a gene by virtue of a frame of reference this series of  nucleotides is one tiny portion on a list of millions of similar nucleotides on the same molecule. Hypothetical geneA is copied incorrectly in one of the progeny of an individual of geneA carrier  these sort of errors happen all the time. This new progeny contains mutant geneA consisting of the sequence ATAGAT. This is now a brand new gene. It contains all of the characteristics of a gene we merely define this portion of the sequence through a frame of reference. If mutgeneA does not kill or sterilize offspring then it can be passed on in the progeny of that offspring  it could now just as well be called geneB but different fields have different conventions about how and when to rename a gene or to consider it a mutgene.tldr a mutant of a gene is just a gene in which the parent and progeny do not share the same nucleotide sequence.,science,ciq5a8s,2,t5_mouw

Interstellar space is filled with enormous fields of gases and plasma and dust many times larger than our Solar System moving in all directions. Each eddy of that also has its own bow shock in whatever direction its moving.Our Suns power creates a giant bubble around the Solar System that protects us from most of that. But the further you get from the Sun the weaker it is until its eventually too weak to overcome those outside forces. At that point is a balance of forces crashing against each other known as the termination shock. In the simplest terms its where the Suns outward force is equalled by outside forces pressing in.Past the termination shock is a zone called the heliopause in which these two forces are more or less equal.

Its not preventing an eruption but basically forcing one to happen in a semicontrolled manner. This hasnt been tried yet though there are rumours the Soviets tried it without success but I dont think they published research that was basically a giant failure and used military resources in their secretive Pacific missile testing range which also happens to be an active volcanic area. Itd be an incredibly fun thing to do research on but youre basically going to need to convince the military to let you use an incredibly accurate and very very high powered explosive to essentially trigger a natural disaster.

In the st case they would look for toadsfrogs who were poisonous and thus they couldnt eat them but if they threatened the animals they would make themselves huge up to the point they would blow themselves up then when they blew themselves up they could safely remove an organ which vital and very healthy for them. In the nd case which i found even more interresting they found wallnuts but had no way to open them. They used the heavy asian traffic to crack open the wallnuts for them. They dropped the wallnuts on the road and the cars would smash them open. It came with a problem though. It was dangerous to pick up the wallnut again. So they found out they could use a crossingpath which had traffic lights. They dropped the nuts on the crossingpath then waited for its lights to turn green. When the light turned green they would join the people crossing the road and pick up their nuts. Needlessly to say it blew my mind when i saw how clever they were on the nd situation.,science,cj6kc6p,11,t5_mouw

Straight at the keeper is likely to get saved if he doesnt move.

Theyre able to replicate quickly with no serious affects besides the common hair falling out diarrhea vomiting etc. Though there is the slight risk of picking up other cancers Squamous Cell Carcinomas from cancer therapy  it still is another alternative to our current and most commonly used alkylating agents. Of course we do have Cell Cycle Specific CCS type chemo drugs but these target only rapidly dividing cells as you mentioned and again work directly at the DNA as intercalators and breaking strands. While youre right to say that MYC is an important factor for all cells  remember that normal nonpathogenic cells have not lost their ability to stop cell progression. There are a number of factors that keep these oncogenes in check. Of course cancerous cells have lost this component so even still  targeting a key transcription regulator does seem like a step in the right direction since it seems it would be more selective. ,science,cjnxznz,1,t5_mouw

Or were all the actors the exact same weight age and gender which would of course defeat the purpose of the study?

1768042,0,t3_2eq71j,gtThe vaccine whose success at blocking infection was described by its own designers as surprising and unexpected appears to work by stimulating the production of a previously unknown group of CD Tcells that stopped the monkeys CD cells from recognising SIV as a foreign invader thereby preventing an immune response to SIV. This suppressant effect  which works in the opposite way to a traditional vaccine  means that the SIV is deprived of the SIVspecific immuneactivated CD cells it needs in order to proliferate and establish an infection in the body.This is strange by causing your immune system to ignore HIV you avoid infection  which makes sense as HIV targets the immune system. So how do we purge the virus from the body?I assuming theres a mechanism that causes viruses to slow disintegrate in the body on the molecular level. Otherwise youd expect random encounters between the virus and their target to occur occasionally and still eventually lead to full blown HIV infection  just slower.Im not confident this is a cure or vaccine  Im not even sure if this is progress. It is interesting though.EditThisgtThe vaccine consisted of inactivated SIV administered alongside doses of familiar bacteria And thisgtTwo initial safety trials are now planned in humans. In one HIVnegative volunteers at low risk of HIV will be given the vaccine to see if it stimulates the same immune and virussuppressant responses. In the other HIVpositive volunteers on fullysuppressive antiviral therapy will be given the vaccine and then taken off ART six months later if test tube results suggest the vaccine has produced such responses.Now this scares me a little. It is going to consist of a deactivated HIV virus and some bacteria  and I dont think the deactivation rate is perfect though the risk of infection through oral ingestion is very low.Id start with the HIVpositive trial first. We need a good treatment now more than we need a vaccine  after all AIDS is a chronic illness unlike most of the diseases we vaccinate against.,science,ck20n4h,28,t5_mouw

There have only been a few thousand cases over the last  years.  Even in Africa this is not enough time or evolutionary pressure to lead to a population with any resistance.  The people with immunological resistance are that way because of chance essentially.  As far as Germany goes the marburg out break again was so tiny that it would have no population level effects.  Everywhere is essentially equal on this one.  As far as it killing to fast from an epidemic control point of view that is a good thing actually.  It highly limits the spread of the virus.  Look at the Marburg outbreak.  It was very quickly contained with little problem.  Marburg is about as infectious and contagious as ebola is and they were able to contain it easily in s Germany.

1811225,0,t1_ck7f1hm,Its not an ASSUMPTION that randomness is better than the equilibrium state. Its a fact that randomness is the optimal strategy. See where it says An ideal game eventually develops a certain pattern. Using a set of math equations described by game theory it is easy to predict this pattern on paper. When the players are each making the most strategic choices the game hovers around what is called an equilibrium state.This is why I can make statements about it. Because it is EASY to predict that the optimal strategy is random and that this is what approximates the equilibrium state. It says over and over that the strategy is to base your choices on any pattern you detect. The game is LITERALLY rock paper scissors.

Despite processing in the peripheral nervous system described in the article somatic sensation depends on primary sensory cortex for it to be a conscious percept. Even though a limb might be missing the brain area responsible for monitoring that region still exists without input from the limb it becomes hypersensitive to intracortical connections and can be activated by other cortical areas which would not normally be strong enough to do so. Referred pain is a similar phenomenon that people without amputations can experience. ,science,ck7k4ly,1,t5_mouw

For example Most of the big penalties are for intent to distribute and just because they are leveling that charge at you then kids plea. But if its just underage they can plea it down to something that isnt even going to remain on their record. Its how our twisted legal system works. compare weed to alcohol Even from the article we are discussing it says Palamars research shows that because of marijuanas legal status teen cannabis users are much more likely to get into trouble with the police than teen alcohol users.Yet teen alcohol use is also illegal. Its just not really enforced  not in the same way that current war on drugs laws are enforced.

1870035,0,t1_ckegtra,I disagree with your decision to use the word impact there at the end. It implies that if they didnt smoke weed then they wouldnt experience any of the problems listed in the study. Who is to say that the same problem that drove them to smoke weed isnt the same problem that causes their underachievement of educational goals or poor mental health?Imagine a kid who is depressed withdrawn and has feelings of isolation. Instead of confronting those problems in a healthy way maybe its because typical support systems like family arent available to them or they could even be the root cause they choose another route. They choose to smoke weed and the effects of the drug as well as the friends and therefore support and commiseration gained lessen their initial negative feelings that drove the decision. All we see as a society though is their decision to do drugs and join a bad crowd. Now lets say they choose not to smoke weed or do any drugs and their feelings of isolation instead withdraw them into themselves and even further into depression. The result could be suicide or violence. We have seen those two very different outcomes in the US and both scenarios include the negative impacts of this study but only one of them involves weed. I dont think marijuana use will help a kid who is at risk of poor mental health or not achieving educational goals. However I dont think marijuana is the root cause of the problem. A multiplier probably. A decision that compounds risk definitely. Its a drug after all once you start regular use its a whole new ballgame of problems and issues. But the root cause of poor mental health and failing to graduate goes much deeper than smoking pot. It is tied up into the process of decision making that lead to the drug use in the first place which like I tried to explain above can be tied to a multitude of things depression family situations anxiety bullying feelings of inadequacy and the list goes on.I just wish we focused more on understanding what was going on inside of these kids heads and hearts than simply judging the actions they make as they become adults and learn to deal with life.,science,ckej6mg,2,t5_mouw

1870939,0,t3_2fzt8d,gt First the causality isnt  percent clear. The researchers did a fantastic job of trying to account for a number of confounding factors. But particularly when it comes to the educational outcomes there are a lot of factors at play. For instance if a teacher knows or even suspects that a certain kid is using drugs that may predispose the teacher against that student. Teachers are very likely to stigmatize drug users says Joseph Palamar coauthor of another recent study comparing teen marijuana and alcohol use. That stereotype gives kids problems and that kids not gonna want to go to class.gt Palamar also says that because marijuana is an illegal drug you have to buy it in an illegal manner and then youre exposed to the black market. Marijuana use is affiliating you with other kids some of whom might be problematic  people more likely to question authority. You become affiliated with things that might have a negative impact on your education.gt Moreover Palamars research shows that because of marijuanas legal status teen cannabis users are much more likely to get into trouble with the police than teen alcohol users. And in many cases if you have a drug conviction on your record you become ineligible for college aid. If you get caught with drugs youre not able to go to college he told me.gt In other words many of the problems associated with teen cannabis use are likely a function of the drugs illegal status.EDIT In any case I dont think its good for any kid to habitually use cannabis recreationally. However if its prescribed and used properly I dont think a teen should be stigmatized for using their medicine.,science,cken3qw,1,t5_mouw

1871087,0,t1_ckehwkk,Agreed.  We got out of previous recessions in the s s and after  by cutting interest rates which prompted people to refinance their homes and pull out a hefty chunk of their equity.  This gave the middle class a load of spending money which helped get companies hiring again which gave people more money to spend and so on...Obviously that scenario cant happen when peoples home values collapse.  This time around its the wealthy and companies that are flush with cash.  The rich have found plenty of ways to risk their capital without all the extra effort of actually creating anything with various financial vehicles.  Companies are not going to spend their cash reserves unless demand picks up.

Make them think about their aggression and how its a side effect of some sort of event in their life where something reinforced that aggression worked out positively for them.  You can access some parts of your memory long forgotten on mushrooms and if you are receiving therapy while on a proper dosage you will be able to get there without losing your self to a large amount of the psilocybin.That and it really can ground you as a person making you realize that even nature isnt something to be aggressive with because were all living and breathing things.  The trees breathe animals breathe and were all one in the same of life.So in conclusion yes I believe it will help people who are troubled in their minds in any aspect.  Key word for it is if taken properly however.  If you gave someone troubled more than their mind can handle it will likely upset them more.

If you lie and cheat your way to the top but succeed and never get caught it is fine because you did not lose any face. Morality only matters as far as what people know about you. If you lose face you must work twice as hard to maintain your original standing.Guilt based societies rely on the individual to feel what they did is wrong. Other people will forgive you for your transgressions as long as you personally hate yourself. Shame based cultures will shun you until you conform or meet their expectations.,science,ckikkj4,8,t5_mouw

Right now we can do a couple seconds before but really thats just because the earthquake has really already started and we just havent felt a big shake yet.It is extremely difficult to predict before because we dont have good D models of fault surfaces at depth and it is very difficult to measure stress along a fault surface sure you can measure a few spots but at the end of the day we are talking about large planes of fracture and even  points of data are pretty useless. Indicators like in this study will have to be used however we already see a large spread between  months and almost immediately before the earthquake occurs. Unless they can somehow correlate the amount of change in the chemistry of the water with how soon the earthquake occurs I feel as though this study is pretty dead in the water.Although that doesnt mean they shouldnt continue to explore this route because they might be able to use it in combination with some other indicator to narrow it down.

1981637,0,t1_ckryymg,It is the case that in many fields psychology for example all the scientific method can do is provide us the best possible estimate. There are generally too many grey areas for us to say without doubt that many accepted theories are fact. Moreover the problem with science is not necessarily the methods but the people employing these methods. People that bring their own opinions and biases into their work whether they intend to or not. People that have built careers in the field and are constantly defending their own work. Ultimately they have a personal interest in convincing others of their own efficacy.I use the courtroom as an example to raise the concept of reasonable doubt. While in academia the accepted theory of the time is good enough to teach and keep in mind that these theories are constantly evolving but it is not always strong enough to erase all doubt. I equate personality tests to polygraph tests. Polygraphers will cite evidence and experience to defend the efficacy of their methods the same way that psychologists do. ,science,ckrzktz,1,t5_mouw

1985694,0,t3_2hf4qb,The problem with this analysis is it focuses too greatly on the biological aspect of selfishnessaltruism ignores the profound impact ideology can have in transforming our minds. Our biological evolution has been surpassed by the evolution of our ideas and concepts which may allow us to adopt frames of thought that may act directly contrary to and override our biological impulses.Take the profound sexual shame and repression within many Christian institutions. One would think from an evolutionary perspective that except for a handful of asexual genetic deadends creatures would not willingly cut themselves off from sexual contact and refuse to breed. Yet the entire core apparatus of the Catholic Church some priests many of whom are not asexual sequester themselves from sexual contact. Some of them fail their vows yet a substantial portion remain celibate for the duration of their lives. Not only is this the case but it has been the case for millenia. If ideology is not capable of overcoming our base biological impulses then how can that be?But if you look at it from an ideological perspective it makes more sense. An ideology does not need reproduction to spread. If a priest goes celibate and gives up all earthly pleasures and goals like reproduction yet converts or maintains the faith of  other members  one would expect his ideology to spread regardless of the fact he does not breed. In fact you might find that an ideology that has a celibate specialist class devoted to propagating its ideals could outspread and wipe out an ideology that has no such specialist class. Just like agricultural societiesideology wiped out huntergatherer societiesideology in most of the world without necessarily changing the biological framework underneath ideologies that emphasize traits counterproductive to biological reproduction like altruism without benefit or celibacy may be able to spread and at least partially alter our perceptions even if a strict evolutionary perspective would not allow it.Other animals dont have language as complex as our own nor do they have the ability to record it for thousands of years nor the ability to propagate and sustain complex ideologies across populations of billions for thousands and thousands of years without substantially changing their brain structure. I think to say Well these animals do altruistic things for purely selfish reasons therefore humans do all altruistic things for purely selfish reasons because otherwise it would be selected against is fundamentally flawed as a result. I think that our ability to create and maintain ideology is one of our greatest evolutionary assets as it allows dramatic shifts in our societies in ways other animals are incapable of. In the same way we can train animals to act in ways contrary to their biological impulses like we can train a tiger to avoid mauling its owner we have essentially domesticated and trained ourselves. We dont need to wait our DNA to evolve because our technology and ideologies can do so far faster and more effectively.In other words evolution selected for some degree of selfish altruism over the course of our history but also selected for adaptable societies capable of rapid transformation through ideas instead of biology. Part of our altruism is for the former reason part of our altruism is in fact selfless due to the latter and the ability of genuinely altruistic societies to spread ideas more effectively than only selfishly altruistic societies.But Im not a scientist just a dude writing shit on the internet so dont take this uneducated rant for anything other than it is.,science,cksh5yt,8,t5_mouw

The idea presented in the paper is that youd require multiple coincident events in several different devices to conclude that a ultrahighenergy cosmic ray shower event occurred. The odds of this happening for the abovementioned sources get to be very low the more devices you require. So you can mitigate this background quite effectively.The energy reconstruction is performed using a likelihood fit of the shape of the cosmic particle shower profile which is indicative of its energy. The shape is measured by fitting to all the phones that were taking data at the time using their geospacial coordinates. So no a single phone cant really tell the energy of the particles that it sees this is why a network of so many devices is called for.You should give the paper a read ,science,cl90ogv,3,t5_mouw

For example in the Abstract we have Morally we could apply such an argument to Mtheory... perhaps it should be Moreover or in an reference to Moyal of MSFT Moyally. I have never heard of a moral application of physics outside of a junior philosophy class. The typo repeats in . where it says in all physics morally one needs to first imagine that string theory... may indeed be the correct description for all physical phenomena. This suggests he means moral as in dont torture puppies.This is not a small complaint...if he does not use moral correctly how do we know whether he is using the word quantum correctly. This is not a complaint about his English...it is a complaint about the language that is Physics.There seems to be basic misunderstanding of QM when the author says The success of QM is of course a justification to accept the mysterious rule as correct. The math in QM is a dual to the physics as FMa is a dual to mechanics. FMa does not explain mechanics it is a mathematical rule that predicts mechanics. The math is not the Physics.The problem is that String Theory like QM is only a set of mathematical rules...and as Lee Smolin says in his The Trouble With Physics has been unable to make any testable predictions in  years of trying.If you want to see a physical explanation for QM read John Bush and his Hydrodynamic quantum analogs  Bush shows that drops moving under the influence of waves in the supporting fluid can provide physical examples of quantum mechanical puzzles.I admit I do not have the math to critique sections  and  of the letter. Despite the author assuring The remainder of this paper should be understandable to the reader without having to know anything about strings or string field theory. The letter may be a superb argument in mathematical philosophy...but it makes no testable predictions is not science and the author clearly does not understand that the math is not the physics the basis for understanding physics. ,science,cls0dkg,2,t5_mouw

One in NZ is our snapper  fishery which should be closed because its effectively collapsed  the problem is it encompasses more than one population and one is doing much worse than the other. We had real problems with out Orange Roughy fishery which has now bounced back to some degree and time will tell if weve learned our lesson on that one.I cant think of many in Australia right now but Southern Bluefin Tuna is not doing well. Bluefin Tuna are a model for how to not manage fisheries well as well see.The Western Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is one stock off the U.S. that is not doing well at all its worse than its Eastern stocks and is considered collapsed by many sources and due to its inherent differences makes for slower growing fish than the Eastern ones.  The Sardine fisheries off the coast of California are another example of poor management  it collapsed pretty heavily after a large boom in production that resulted in Cannery Row only to show signs of recovery then another collapse again in recent years.,science,clss0qf,2,t5_mouw

2343586,0,t3_2m6d68,Ive seen a phenomenon which seems to be similar to the DunningKruger Effect but happening at the other end of the intelligence spectrum and Id like to hear your thoughts about it.And now for the somewhat lengthy explanation of what I mean. Ira Glass has famously described why beginners in art are often frustrated They get into the field because their taste level is high but as beginners naturally their skill level is low. And because their taste level is high theyre aware that their skill level is low. The disappointment comes from the gap between what they enjoy and what they can make. Thats all pretty straight forward I think.The weird effect that Ive noticed is something that happens among MFA students specifically creative writing. As you become a better writer your taste level also improves and can outpace the improvements to your skill. The result is that you feel even further away from your goal despite being significantly more skilled. Or to rather inelegantly use some numbers to explainThe writer gets into it because he has good taste T. But his skill level is low S. If he pushes through and keeps at it his skill level will improve until hes starting to feel pretty competent S. Then he enters an MFA program and studies writing more. Both his taste and skill increase T S. The result is that his skill has increased by roughly  but when he used to feel just  away from being a good writer now he feels  away.We could write this off as the T writer simply being naive about good writing but I dont think thats the case. After all he got to be T by reading published writing that was often written at S. So when he reaches S he may actually be perfectly capable at producing publishable and commercially viable work. The weird part is that he feels even less worthy of publication than when he was S.Im sure theres a question in there somewhere.

The pay gap shrinks when comparing women and men with identical education and experience in the same job but there is still an unexplained  pay gap which suggests that persistent pay discrimination still occurs in the workplace.

Two wellpowered familybased exome sequencing studies targeting de novo mutations reveal novel insights into the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorders ASDs. The first study by Iossifov et al. analysed the genomes of gt simplex families  that is families in which neither parent nor siblings of a child with ASD are affected  and showed that  of de novo missense mutations and  of de novo likely genedisrupting mutations contribute to  and  of diagnoses respectively. Of note genes affected by spontaneous mutations were often expressed during embryonic development or encoded chromatinremodelling proteins. The latter finding was also reported in the second study by De Rubeis et al. who sequenced the exomes of  autism cases and  ancestrymatched or parental controls. The researchers also found that mutated genes were enriched for those encoding products involved in synaptic formation and transcriptional regulation. Together these studies highlight the promising role of exome sequencing for the discovery of diseaserelevant genes in neuropsychiatric disease.,science,cm3hu9r,1,t5_mouw

2380912,0,t1_cm5x69j,Some geneticists want to see adaptive advantage everywhere. lm not one of them.  Most BRCArelated diseases strike later in life when reproduction is done and this especially in our evolutionary past with far lower survivorship.  It would have been invisible to natural selection basically.  Also we know from very clear and multiple studies that the risk even of the same mutation can vary greatly over even the decades since the genes were discovered. That is environment makes a huge difference in risk.I dont know about FGFR in this context but BRCAs are mutation repair genes as I understand it.  They dont cause cancer but they allow cell lineages to accumulate mutations that along with whatever else may have been inherited lead to a cell being transformed into a cancer cell.  That is at least one reasonwaiting for those mutationsthat onset is not immediate at very young age.A trial of a drug inhibiting a gene called PALP that is also involved in DNA repair was designed to let the cell die of mutations rather than be repairedsomething like that.  So the problem is not to inhibit BRCA but to let mutations a damaged BRCA gene failed to detect.  But the trial failed to produce an effect and was stopped as I understand it.Again however I am not working in any area of gene therapy so my answer is likely incomplete at best.,science,cm5zm27,4,t5_mouw

2440666,0,t1_cmd432h,I wrote this elsewhere in the thread. You may like it.    gt Lets take an example of a theoretical genetic trait in early humans that made the person sterile but superstrong so strong that she can guarantee their familys survival in an otherwise harsh climate.gt gt gt gt And lets say the trait is a simple Punnett square recessive one where if two parents each having one dominant and one recessive gene breed  of their children have recessiverecessive genes sterile superhumans  of their children have dominantrecessive genes fertile regular humans but with a recessive gene tagging along like their parents had and  or their children have dominantdominant genes fertile regular humans that will never have superhuman children.gt gt gt gt Each sterile child would indeed eventually die without reproducing and passing his genes to offspring but their family unit would survive due to their siblings uncanny ability to rip a sabertooth tiger in half and go off to form their own families. Fertile siblings with dominantdominant gene combinations would never be able to bare superhuman kids leaving their children though  fertile incredibly vulnerable to danger and unlikely to survive to adulthood. But fertile siblings with dominantrecessive combinations that mated with others of the same combination would have a chance to have several fertile children along with a sterile child that looks like the Hulk and can beat a wooly mammoth to death with its own trunk.gt gt gt gt Thus a gene may be favored by evolution even though receiving it from both parents or it coupled with another specific gene results in a child that cannot reproduce. In fact something similar but less cartoonish than my example is actually documented in humans living in regions affected by malaria. Sicklecell anemia is a recessiverecessive gene trait that pretty much guarantees an early childhood death if untreated by modern medicine yet it is quite common in malariaprone zones. This is because getting a dominantrecessive combination provides resistance to malaria gt gt gt gt I aint saying theres a gay gene or genes but simply saying Gay people dont reproduce doesnt immediately disprove the theory.,science,cmdddx4,3,t5_mouw

2443365,0,t3_2nh1mn,Ocean fertilization will save us all I firmly believe that at this point.You increase fishery yield sequester ridiculous sums of CO and all it takes is very very finely ground iron sulfate in modest quantities.Its not even that much.  Russ Georges extremely controversial release of  tonnes of iron sulfate into the Alaskan fishery has been linked to both a massively increased salmon yield from the fishery but also an increase in phytoplankton mass over an area of up to  square miles.Such a large area is unlikely imo but even if it was true there are well over  square miles of deep iron depleted ocean surface on the Earth.  If we seeded all of it  tonnes of iron sulfate that could potentially sequester over  billion tonnes of carbon.  Essentially the entire global emissions.Thats assuming this preliminary test and data are accurate which its almost certainly being overly optimistic.  We likely can successfully seed quite a bit more than  ton per  square miles without causing any oxygen depleting algae bloom.  Coastal dust storms blow thousands of tons of material over a much much smaller area causing significant blooms that still dont result in any benthic fishkills from hypoxic waters. tonnes of iron sulfate plus a fleet of ships to distribute it would also only cost a few billion dollar total.  We could sequester the entire globes CO emissions for essentially pennies. Obviously a metric fuck ton more research needs to be done and a reasonable step up plan would need emplaced to ensure we dont destroy the fisheries instead of bolster them but phytoplankton are the base of the entire food chain in the oceans.  They have depleted a bit in mass in the last  years likely from ocean acidification so increasing them at least a little bit we can be assured wouldnt cause catastrophe.  ,science,cmdpdj6,1,t5_mouw

I think we have to utilize translatable data set in a methodical and progressive fashion starting through simulated models eventually making it to animal models then finally a careful clinical study. If you think carefully about it youre proposing a logical fallacy. You say that doing a mouse study does not always provide applicable data to go to inhuman absolutely true. But then you say that going from pure theory to inhuman is logical? Just because its clinical trials does not mean its not inhuman. What you propose simply has no regulatory technical or ethical basis to happen. Regulatory  You MUST show fitness for use with some form of rationale study before you even go near humans. While this specific study is commercialized product there must be an evidence of indication of use to begin studying for it. Your statement seemed general anyways. I have personally authored multiple submissions to the FDA regarding initiation of clinical trials for Class III Combination Products. Believe me when I say that due diligence and proof of such is about x more than you would expect in a school lab capacity.Technical  Ive kind of touched on this but youre talking about hypothesizing straight to fitness for use testing. The interim steps are not only necessary for scientific veracity but absolutely necessary for indication of use. The regulatory landscape has changed drastically in the last two years so were talking about no more it works for this random thing but we dont know why when you indicate it for use. Doctors can of course still prescribe it as they see fit.  The technical aspects to establishing a conclusion is a stepwise approach. Now please once again notice I didnt say to NEVER do final fitness for use testing but only after a long process should it even be considered. Ethically  Obviously clinical trials for final use would be beneficial for some pathologies. The FDA has given special priority for these intended treatments in the form of Early Feasibility Studies allowing inhuman even predesign verification testing. This is a brand new pathway and as such may change in the future years. For everything else to say that you can go from theory to practice when were not just talking about health risks but possible life and death is just ludicrous. Youre not only violating the credo of all who are in the medical profession but youre being egotistical and arrogant.

2642951,0,t1_cn3grhr,Disagree.  Reward seeking behavior isnt doing work its doing things that avoid work.  Stress in general tends to cause people to avoid stressful situations and seek out comforting and rewarding situations. This generally leads to a pattern of avoiding work avoiding confrontation and slacking off. It means that say youre in an office where Reddit is blocked and youre not allowed to browse it during work hours but you like to read Reddit as an escape.  If you are under little stress thats OK.  Youll do your work. You can do all your redditing at home. If youre under a lot of stress you will find a way to proxy it or go to the bathroom and read it on your phone or do some extra work to do that reward.If your employer is making your workplace stressful working at your job is not a rewarding behavior youre going to seek.  Not even if youre being paid. For instance repeat the same experiment.  Have one group stroke a teddy bear and the other group put their hand in ice water.  Give each of them a cash reward the longer they either stroke the teddy bear or submerge their hand in ice water.   Also leave in the smell of chocolate and let them eat it when they are finished.Id bet that the person submerging their hand in the water will still strain more to smell the chocolate than the person stroking the teddy bear.  But the group of people stroking the teddy bear will do that longer and get the larger cash reward.  The person with their hand in the ice water will want that more immediate reward and to be able to stop feeling that stressinducing discomfort.  The person who is doing the routine behavior that is not uncomfortable will be able to keep up with it longer without distraction. ,science,cn3kdza,130,t5_mouw

But writing in stuff into the brain is a little exaggerated. All theyve done is allowed the optogenetic signal to express a protein they encoded.The coolest part however is the use of the holographic technique to cut their beams into little beamlets and then activate specific cells.

2660489,0,t1_cn5mfet,X inactivation does happen randomly but it happens at an early stage of development. Youre correct in your observation that the patchy pattern would be very unlikely if random X inactivation happened in a fullgrown cat. X inactivation is still an active area of study but the current understanding is that it happens in two stages. First XIST is randomly expressed by one X chromosome at the  cell stage. Whichever chromosome does this is coated with the XIST RNA and consequently inactivated. Later in development XIST expression is downregulated and inactive X chromosomes are reactivated. Finally cells begin to differentiate and XIST is once again expressed by one of the two X chromosomes. Which X chromosome expresses XIST as best scientists can tell is determined randomly. Once an X chromosome is inactivated at this stage of development any cells descended from it will also have that X chromosome inactivated and thats why we see the patchy pattern on calico cats. Basically the cells in an orange patch descended from the same cell which had the X chromosome containing the orange fur allele active and the other X chromosome inactive.There are other more complicated genetic mechanisms at work in calico cats for example the white fur on calico cats is controlled by a separate gene which results in the difference we observe between calico cats and tortoiseshell cats. Im not familiar with a lot of the genetic mechanisms that control cats coat color so I cant comment on the unique patterns you see on your kitties but it could have something to do with X inactivation and how the coat color gene on that chromosome interacts with the other genes that influence coat color.,science,cn5ur0n,2,t5_mouw

The above is not correct  our cameras must be manually activated by the officer at the beginning of the incident and manually shut off at the end.  They are not constantly running.  They have enough battery life for about two hours of operation.  The picture quality is really excellent though.I would personally oppose any attempt to have police officers wear a recording device which is CONSTANTLY recording while theyre onduty.  Ill be completely frank in explaining why we work a job where you routinely see things which can be distressing and one of the ways to cope is a lot of very dark humour.  In a patrol car late at night things are said between colleagues which would be perfectly acceptable in any other place of work  criticism of colleagues comments about suspects and the abovementioned dark humour  but which you wouldnt want listened to by an outsider who doesnt know your sense of humour or understand the context of whats being said or could even be the person youre criticising.  Think about the way you communicate with your colleagues  would you be as close to them if your supervisor could listen to your entire conversation?

The way Im imagining the soil bacteria to be working is that they constantly at a low level express some receptor system for detecting the presence of a signal molecule and when it is present that molecule binds to the receptor induces some shapechange that transduces the signal through one or more steps into a series of inhibitors and transcription factor proteins that then turn on the replication process... As such the regulatory machinery is always being transcribed at a low level both when the cells are growing and not and thus would not be expected to have a differential gene expression profile.  Still the idea of placing cells in a sterile environment and in a natural environment and then comparing gene expression is fun.  Id suggest thinking more on that.,science,cnil88t,1,t5_mouw

We would most likely practice till dark every day and thanks to no lights on the field it would actually take away from total practice time. Game days I may need to leave school a class or two early depending on how far away it is but in reality that will only be a few days out of the year.I get to sleep in will be more well rested in early classes and be able to stay awake better. Ill be tentative by the time I get to school and with AP Calc first period I would really benefit from being  cognitive when I have to learn about derivative tests and implicit differentiation.Im a procrastinator I often do my homework in the mornings and if I have a lot of stuff to do then so be it I have even more time to get my homework done and I dont have to use up my nights.Senior year currently a Junior I only need to take  classes. I can elect to take a late start not have to come to school until  every day not have any traffic to worry about.

I believe it would be as easy as educating and incentivising people to not have kids.gtOther efforts are easier.Not having kids would be far easier than placing a premium prices on food water and energy. If you want to increase the contrast between the haves and the have nots then letting population expand while resources dwindle is the way you would do that.gtWe also see that as population decreases people consume more per capita because resources are cheaper.Please take a moment to consider the inverse of that statement population increases people consume less because resources are more expensive. Youll then get an idea of just how ugly life will be when the lower income earners can no longer afford to pay for basic resources and only the wealthy will be able to afford to run their heaters air cons and computers.For reference...gtA study by statisticians at Oregon State University concluded that in the United States the carbon legacy and greenhouse gas impact of an extra child is almost  times more important than some of the other environmentally sensitive practices people might employ their entire lives  things like driving a high mileage car recycling or using energyefficient appliances and light bulbs.,science,cnrn72i,0,t5_mouw

We dont know what dark matter is the current thinking is that it is a new kind of elementary particle.Dark energy is totally different it cannot be made of ordinary particles which respond to gravity in the ordinary way.

Most likely what happened was that chunks of DNA were excised from plant nuclei via transposons and deposited in animal genomes which allowed them to sustain the plant organelles.I know its weird but we have documented this occurring. I mean if you really wanted to get into some interesting thoughts you could think about the fact that a gene from your SO could leave their body via transposons and enter your body while you guys slept and incorporate itself into the genome of one of your own cells thus making your mate part of you ... literally.

Something caused the initial radioactive atom to be formed.  Usually the splitting of another atom or the collision of other atoms.  Its decay is simply the result of that formation.  When you are born you have a  change of dying.  When you die is the variable that is as of yet impossible to predict.  Similar to decay.  But your birth is certainly the cause of your death!If you are referring to the  radionuclides that date before the time of formation of our solar system the mechanism for their creation may still be unknown but isnt necessarily without cause.

3072139,0,t1_cogdoun,I agree. The limiting factor of what we know is the time frame of reference that we have. If we are on the upward or cresting stage of expansion we wouldnt really know because that is our only frame of reference to call upon. Its harder to come up with a plausible theory of what we dont know rate of expansion or plausible contraction of Dark energy  than it is to take what we can observe and form a hypothesis. Science changes over time. We cant hold all laws and theories to be absolute because our frame of reference is constantly changing. The only thing we can do is take our hypothesis and try to integrate it into what we currently know to see it if holds true. What I also want to mention is that while dark energy is somewhat of a placeholder it is needed to explain the acceleration of the universe and is explained by the cosmological constant. This states that if there is a positive amount of dark energy the result is a negative vacuum force which drives explains the increasing velocity of the universe. Dark energy also accounts for roughly  of our universe as there is not enough matter in our universe to correlate with its change in acceleration. ,science,cogfa6x,2,t5_mouw

So an mg. bottle contains mgml over a ml bottle thats mg.As for cigarettes its more like mg of nicotine here in the UK but Ive no idea if thats across the whole cigarette or on a perpuff basis.It is true however that nicotine absorption from ecigarettes is lower than from a regular cigarettegtNo matter how much I got out of a hit it would never really put me over that ceilingSome vapers had similar problems to you and started to use eliquid that was steeped from tobacco leaf in order to get more of the alkaloids out. It is called whole tobacco alkaloid eliquid The problem is in the steeping process as well as pulling out the extra alkaloids you probably also end up pulling out some of the more harmful chemicals although its definitely still better than burning the stuff.gtAnother possible difference is that eliquid nicotine is anecdote incoming extracted from potatoes rather than tobacco theyre both nightshades!.Ive no idea if pharmaceutical grade nicotine is made from potatoes Id heard it was extracted from tobacco Ive always assumed the potatotomatoaubergine etc. thing was just something militant provapers liked to pull out so they can say its not really a tobacco product. gtI wonder if the extraction for eliquid only gets nicotine.I expect pharmaceutical grade nicotine which is what any reputable eliquid lab uses goes through some fairly rigorous chemical analysis to earn its title so I very much doubt theres much other than nicotine and propylene glycol in it.Im well aware that  of my ecigarettes effectiveness comes from the throat hit and the feel in the mouth thats why I vape mg eliquid because it kicks my throat like a mule.

For me nicotine isnt even that addictive theres something else less tangible about regular cigarettes that got me hooked which Ive always assumed was the MAOI nicotine potentiator and other alkaloids.

The dust bowl wasnt just a weather event  it happened around roughly the same time as mass mechanization of agriculture too. So increasingly the American farm required fewer laborers too.

It seems like uInTheUnions recommendation is more about the latter. Also Im not familiar with that author which brings me to my second suggestion try to find something that is written by a wellknown mindfulness researcher or a therapist who uses mindfulness in a manner supported by research again not knocking uInTheUnions text. Just relaying general good practice.Sometimes it takes a little investigating but you can stick to some bigger names in the field for some really insightful and useful stuff thats been proven to work. uPippiPong suggested a reading on mindfulness for depression coauthored by Williams Teasdale Segal and KabatZinn. These are THE big figures in mindfulness research and practice today and you can feel confident picking up any of their stuff and kudos to uPippiPong on emphasizing researchbacked reading!. Though unless depression is specifically what youre working on that book may or may not be the best place to start.For someone just getting into the mindfulness game I think KabatZinns book Wherever You Go There You Are is a great place to start. It was written over  years ago but KabatZinn really started the mindfulness movement in the West and this book is what a lot of todays mindfulness work is built on. Id also strongly recommend anything by Ruth Baer such as Practicing Happiness which is much more current.Hope that helps!,science,coom5uh,2,t5_mouw

3151461,0,t1_cojtyou,The guy who played Borat has a cousin a neuroscience researcher from New York who studied a group of closeknit computer engineers in a Scandinavian country. They tended to intermarry within their group and have a higher rate of autism in children than the rest of the communities or the city. Since engineering has long been thought of as a stereotypically autistic profession it suggests that the parents were somewhat autistic too and the kids got a double whammy.He generated some controversy by saying that this overdose could be called an extreme male mind angering some feminists who cried foul over the notion that engineering and mathematics are gendered professions and that math and logic are boys skills. The reason he believes this is because of a possible link to fetal testosterone in the autistic kids that did something to the developing brain. Testosterone being the male hormone it naturally follows that the engineer parents would have a male mind with a lot of mathy tendencies.The title of this book The science of evil and some chapters inside suggests a possible link between autism and sociopathypsychopathy that made a lot of other people mostly parents of autistic kids and adult autistics really mad because it seems to suggest that autism to the extreme leads to an Adam Lanza serial killer. IMHO none of these kneejerk reactions preclude the necessity for investigating the theory further.

If the HPV vaccine were cheap I am sure there would be universal support for everyone including men getting it but its not its extremely expensive. You dont just give everyone any medical treatment that could possibly in a remote circumstance benefit them or their partners regardless of the cost. Many studies on giving it to men have been done that have found the benefit of preventing rare cancers simply isnt worth the current cost and it seems to have been recommended in the US only after extensive lobbying from its manufacturers who obviously stand to make money the more people who get it. Its unit manufacturing cost is next to nothing most of the cost was in developing it so they are making hundreds of dollars on each additional person they can get it into.These studies have also factored in herd immunity and have also found that there would be far more benefit from extending vaccination coverage of females which is still quite low well under  of young women in many states than trying to get men to get it also.It is simply not such an important vaccine for men indeed it is debateable whether men should be getting it at all. ,science,couel1g,0,t5_mouw

Its very real and very powerful and everybody is subject to it.Im only poking at this because nearly every week someone at work talks about their gluten free diet and its so completely obvious they have no idea what theyre talking about.One of them has doctor diagnose allergies to corn.  Those are real and hes been on a treatment plan for several years.  So a few weeks ago he comes in and declares himself Gluten Free so of course I have to ask.So he tells this story about how he felt foggy all one weekend so he decided to see if it was gluten by eliminating it from his diet.  Magically HE FELT BETTER!  He then went online and found a list of symptoms and every one of them matched right down the list!Well lets just take a look at this testing methodology.  No control.  Sample set of ONE and he evaluated his own results.  Didnt eliminate the possibility and highly likely reason of an accidental ingestion of a corn product on the prior weekend.The other part is the people who just hear the word diet in Gluten Free Diet and associate it solely with losing weight.  More nonsense.For the people with real diagnosed gluten sensitivities this is wonderful.  They have more choices of food and restaurants than ever before at least for now.

Going a step further it might be possible to convince people they will be safer using it when they arent really high risk for getting frostbite. By convincing parents to use it to keep their children playing outside in the snow safe or convincing skiers they might regret not using it you might be able to get a much larger market.

If youre familiar with running statistics you know that you have to be very careful in how you interpret outliers. Its possible that these three subjects have real NCGS but its also very possible that they have appeared this way for some other reason such as false negatives in exclusion screening.Also think about the numbers here. Out of  people who are convinced they have NCGS maybe three of them actually have it? And that isnt even well established?

At first the evidence seemed to be strong just look at the sea of glinting specs in any university lecture theatre or academic conference and you would seem to find proof of a link. Yet epidemiological studies suggest the effects are much smaller than once believed. The more we studied it and measured the amount people read the more the association seemed to vanish says Flitcroft. One large study following the progress of children in Ohio appeared to show no correlation at all with reading though we should not yet rule out the effect completely says Jacobsen. Instead many now argue that it is the time spent indoors rather than reading per se that matters most. Study after study from Europe Australia and Asia have all found that people who spend more time outside are far less likely to get shortsighted than people whose lives are mostly confined within four walls.To me this indicates that they discovered that what you call Link to intelligence is not as strong as previously believed.Also regarding genetics they writegt Our genes may still play a role in deciding who becomes shortsighted but it was only through a change in environment that the problems began to emerge.Its not so much as to dispute it its more to consider whether or not genetics actually meant anything in the matter which they concluded it likely does this suggests further research is needed to determine it entirely.,science,cp55agz,2,t5_mouw

But even still the aerosol is made up of a ratio of Propylene Glycol and Vegetable Glycerine seems standard the ratio changes depending on what the user wants out of the experience. a nicotine infused liquidoptional most ejuice comes in nonnicotine versions. and flavouringsfood grade is my understanding..Common issues people bring up are accroleinsic but the temperatures needed to produce that are higher than your standard vaping setupbut could be found in an improperly conducted study if youre burning out coils through prolonged activation diacetyl which is found in some buttery flavoured juice but many venders are opting for nondiacetyl flavourings and allergies to the ingredients or other preexisting issues people have and the effect those ingredients have.Additionally the potential to burn the wicking material exists if the device isnt properly saturated. When you get dry hits or a burnt flavour I assume youre inhaling burnt cottonwhatever wicking material you use and I dont know the adverse effects those could have. However that is only something you get occasionally from improper usewhich some studies have probably found through improper testing finding all sorts of nasty stuff.The only other issue I could think of is using nonorganic wicking materials. You wouldnt want to be vaping off bleached cotton but organic cotton is far and away the most popular wicking material amongst serious vapers and is used in the coil heads of many recent popular atomizers. This is where I feel any study should look. The ingredients of the juice the wicking material and standard vaping operation to get a true idea of what an actual vaper experiences with a variety of devices and juice. It would also be helpful to study what youre getting from dryburnt coil hits separately since they are a rarity but still a potential concern.,science,cp70xwa,1,t5_mouw

3350864,0,t1_cpa7zg4,From the papergtIDR involves six core steps. First onetoone workshops between a film director and actors are used to develop composite fictional characters that draw in part on selected aspects of the actors work histories and personal lives as well as those of their peer groups. Second the method involves deep immersion in character and context in preparation for filming. Third the director strategically withholds details of the dramatic context from the actors  so that in the present instance they are briefed to perform as participants in a social psychology experiment but not given any more specific information e.g. about the nature of the study or its design. Fourth the method uses realworld design and environments as much as possible. In the present case this involved attempting to faithfully reproduce both the laboratory environment and the shock machine. Fifth filming involves long takes and multicamera coverage. This is made possible and relatively inexpensive by modern digital technologies and frees the actors to focus on their interactions with the environment and other participants. In the present case individual takes or recordings were up to  minutes in length. Sixth at the conclusion of the first take the film director conducts a debrief with each actor providing information about the project and its aims differentiating between the behavior of the character and how they personally might have behaved and addressing any questions or concerns they might have.,science,cpa81z1,4,t5_mouw

I think they need to educate people and disassociate these things from being a disorder because youre intelligent and have skills and talents others dont have that will help in a multitude of ways. I also doubt you have a problem functioning in a way that works for you which they could learn to work with so I bet its more likely you just dont function well in the way they want you to.

This study could have made me conclude it was just a placebo so I read the study in full.The study doesnt measure erections it doesnt ask questions on erection quality and it doesnt investigate erection functionality without porn.The study actually  studdies asks men to self report arousal and asumes that arousal is equivalent to erections. This is a major flaw in any ED scenario arousal is occuring without an erection. That is the disfunction. Assuming that arousal allways corresponds to an erection shows a misunderstanding of Erectile Disfunction in men. It just asks men to report their level of arousal whilst watching porn. It finds that those who watch porn regularly are more aroused while watching porn than those who dont watch porn regularly. Which makes sense there are plenty of studies which show sexual tastes are at some level conditioned. What the study doesnt do is record arousal from other stimulus. Recording arousal from self stimulation an exotic dancerreal person etc. Would give the study the data to see if greater porn watching leads to greater arousal in real life scenarios. However this observation is not made.In order to draw the conclusion they have made they need to have Measured erections in some way Used control groups Used stimulus other than porn as a comparison Asked about porn viewing historyThe study does none of these things.This also isnt a study in itself it is a meta analysis. There are  studdies of data used and none of those studdies directly investigated erectile dysfunction.Give it a read dont immediately form opinions based on the single sentence summary of the abstract.,science,cpi2qyz,6,t5_mouw

3445578,0,t1_cpkzsne,I dont know what I think. But I know this stuff is concerning. Mind weighing in? On trust The White House has officially admitted that fake vaccination programs have been used by the United States as a cover for covertly stealing DNA samples from the public as part of the socalled war on terror. The aim of the scheme carried out in the Middle East was to use DNA analysis to identify suspected terrorists who would then be targeted to be killed by the United States. Can you link to a single independent randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study proving either the safety or effectiveness of the HN swine flu vaccines that were pushed so heavily? How about this study that said the influenza vaccine reduced influenza infections in  out of  people. Or put another way  of those injected with the vaccine received no benefit and no different outcome. What about the CDC list of additives in vaccines like Aluminum Antibiotics Formaldehyde MSG and of course Thimerosal? How about the comments from this guy who asserts that clinical trials are outsourced to developing countries where it is far easier to shape the results you are paid to deliver? On trust again Theres this video that shows a Pentagon FunVax presentation on how the military can spread a virus and use a vaccine to extinguish undesirable human behavior. Then theres the whole Merck can of worms. According to the whistleblowers court documents Mercks misconduct was farranging It failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented ii used improper testing techniques iii manipulated testing methodology iv abandoned undesirable test results v falsified test data vi failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine vii falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling viii falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA ix falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract x engaged in the fraud and concealment describe herein for the purpose of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for mumps vaccine xi mislabeled misbranded and falsely certified its mumps vaccine and xii engaged in the other acts described herein to conceal the diminished efficacy of the vaccine the government was purchasing.

The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cows milk whey and casein as a protein source a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source lactose as a carbohydrate source a vitaminmineral mix and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cows milk mostly in the United States and Great Britain and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods including cows milk resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of  and months.Wikipedia,science,cpq7kc6,2,t5_mouw

But considering how much rice our family ate daily cooking it in the manner described in the article would more than likely been healthier for us.  While I agree with you regarding the need of calories to survive for some individuals  particularly in cultures that rely heavily on rice   cooking rice in a manner that changes the form of starch becomes the healthier option simply because of how much more is eaten in these regions. And while lowering the rice intake would be the most obvious way to decrease the amount of calories it sometimes isnt an option I can only speak as to my experience growing up poor but my family ate lots of rice because it was extremely cheap and essentially a filler food to supplant for other foods we lacked and we did so until being full.

Actually drives me crazy to see cancer patients taking B vitamins without telling their oncologists without realizing that not only can the vitamins interfere with chemotherapy but they may be making the cancer cells grow faster.And multivitamins have never been shown to help mortality while there are actually studies showing they may increase your mortality.  Nobody has ever even studied what happens when you have such a huge mix of vitamins in your gut at the same time are there reactions between the different vitamins and minerals in vivo that were not realizing?  Thereve been some studies that suggest that certain mixtures of vitamins can lead to the formation of stuff thats not so healthy but nobodys really done a well funded study on this sort of thing.And then theres the fact that over the counter vitamins may or may not even be what theyre labeled as.Eat a healthy diet full of green leafy veggies though and you seem to reduce your risk of death for all sorts of stuff.,science,cpvitej,1,t5_mouw

However we dont have conclusive data showing that nicotine causes increased risk for cardiovascular disease although it is reasonable to hypothesize that this is probably due to a lack of data more than a lack of effect.

All of the ice on earth would be melted long before then.  But albedo is not simply a positive feedback due to ice loss.  There is an increased albedo as you evaporate water due to increased in cloud cover.  There is also a warming component to this high clouds warm but the point is that these things max out at a point due to physical limitations.  Feedbacks were something I covered in a freshman course in my undergrad education.  Its not something unknown to me.  But the reason theyre called feedbacks are because they just amplify the warming or cooling and dont actually facilitate warming on their own.  If you have literature that is up to date that suggest a runaway effect is possible then by all means post it.

3560949,1,t1_cpxzc9n,Thought that for a long time as well but its not true.  Of course burning more energy than you consume will result in weight loss but that doesnt mean theres not more to it. Yes in a pure energy since by definition a calorie will always be the same but we are not pure energy.  We have these pesky things called hormones which can work to our detriment or benefit.  The biggest factor is the effect these calories have on our blood sugar.  The more a calorie affects our blood sugar the faster it gets put to use.Thats why simple carbs are so great post work out because we use them right away for the repairs our muscles now desperately need. If I ate a bag of skittles while sitting on my couch they would immediately go to storage fat because my body has no use for them. Constant blood sugar spikes can cause a whole host of other health issues as well.Sorry for the long winded response but this is one of those things I wish was made clear to me a long time ago.  The misconception comes from over simplified science and is perpetuated by people who want to rationalize less than stellar eating habits like me for a while ... and sometimes still today.

I commented above and including what I thought was an enlightening and entertaining interview with Bob Bakker on the BrontoApato topic.As your other replier stated the head is different. Basically what we colloquially  know as Apatosaurus was named first. The scientific name is Apatosaurus ajax.  Some years later the same guy Marsh btw a well known paleontologist who named lots of dinosaurs including stegosaurus and triceratops named another species Brontosaurus excelsus. A handful of years later another scientist grouped these two species in the same genus since the first specimen was not fully grown they were found in the same fossil bed among other things. In taxonomy names are  given priority based on agethat is the oldest assigned name has precedence over later names in cases of conflict. Thus Apatosaurus subsumes Brontosaurus.Basically this report highlights a paper that says actually these two specimens are not similar enough that they should be grouped in the same genera. If this eventually becomes consensus then Brontosaurus will be back.,science,cq44c19,2,t5_mouw

Eventually both groups transition onto placebo. The pain was still being mitigated to a certain extent while on placebo. But after another certain period of time one group would remain on placebo while the other group transitions onto some antimorphine drug.Despite it being ages since there was any morphine left in the patients systems the group that took antimorphine drugs fared worse than those still taking placebo.

3695418,0,t1_cqdhpet,Correct. The numbers are likely different for the test applied. That is exactly what I said. That doesnt mean that the effect was due to probiotics and it doesnt mean that the interpretation isnt still subject to intrinsic error. A p value of . corresponds to a  in  chance that the null hypothesis no difference is valid.  Meaning that at the error level computed the same results would be expected to be found by pure chance at least once every  times the test is performed. What this literally translates into is a situation where p values will be artificially lower when systematic error or bias isnt properly accounted for. I get it you want to believe that altering your diet will change everything about everything for you. When investigators go fishing across a myriad of subjective and qualitative fields like they did in this study the odds are pretty good that something is going to show up with a low p value.

I am coming from this a little biased because Im a physician presently work in a CLIAapproved reference lab specifically doing moleculargenetic analysis of this type.I just felt that the title of the posted article would be pretty misleading if someone with a nonmedical background with or without a cancer diagnosis was to read it.  Molecular testing for the wellcharacterized gene mutations is very good.The excessively large gene panels are out there and being ordered.... but fortunately still only quite rarely and usually never in your more routinetype cancers.  At present we are only getting a rare order for larger panels from cancer patients referred to genetic counselors or very atypical cases.  This is probably a good thing as a whole for patients.  Large panels like those provided by FoundationOne for example provide a slew of information.... much of which has not been vetted by the medical literature.  Many of the mutations may or may not be pathogenic oftentimes just coming down to a scientific best guess.  From experience I can tell you that even seasoned oncologists have a hard time knowing what to do with the info which may or may not be pertinent for the patients care.I think it will take longer time than what is popularized by the media to sort out this information and hopefully it will prevent healthy people from getting unnecessarily sequenced.

3751194,0,t1_cqjkddc,Great Questions!.  Primarily exvivo systems will be able to address the CRISPR treatment immunigenicity as the protein is inherently cytotoxic anything that breaks DNA is. There are just too many potential problems if you were to introduce CRISPR into a person as a treatment as you noted immunogenicity localized apoptosis random integration carcinogenicity etc..  We can suss out the successfullytreated iPS cells exvivo and ensure that they are in working condition with no extra mutations caused by the CRISPR before differentiating the cells and transplanting them back into the person.  This will prevent any immune response from the CRISPR treatment.. The transfection efficiency of SFHR is quite high between  in iPS cells if we use newer technologies like nucleofection.  The main problem is the low integration efficiency of our correction fragmentin the Some Background lab note on our project proposal page I discuss this in depth and describe a technique I developed that would help us select for corrected cells. Another huge factor is the speed cell growthwe can only work as fast as the cells grow so that prevents us from making quick progress on experiments like this..  Ill let my dad come in and answer this question in relation to CF.  I have more experience with Sickle Cell Anemia and know that you need roughly  of the bone marrow to be expressing corrected betaglobin in order for Sickle symptoms to be completely ameliorated.  CRISPR essentially ups the integration efficiency of our correction fragment.  Plasmid treatment works but isnt permanent and doesnt carry through mitosis.And I think Ill take you up on your offer to rant.  I have a personal qualm against the hype surrounding CRISPR.  Its real advantage is that its easier to make than say TALEN or ZincFinger Nucleases.  All three of the systems do the exact same thing induce double strand breaks in the DNA at a predetermined site.  The discovery of CRISPR didnt fundamentally change the techniqueit just made them easier.  Gene editing techniques have existed since far before CRISPR so all of the attention it gets is quite absurd.  The really impressive tools were ZIncFinger Nucleases but they were so difficult to properly make that no one gave them the proper credit.  They were the first nucleases designed to induce sitespecific doublestrand breaks in DNA and do the exact same thing as CRISPR except they were developed  decades earlier in the mid s.

Using Rawls is only supporting that argument. I dont thing you can definitively claim that the slippery slope doesnt exist. It also seems to me that the slippery slope opponents of IVF were talking about includes this sort of genetic modification. Next pathogenic genes dont exist at least Ive never heard of them. If youre talking about treating genetic disorders how do we define what is a genetic disorder from what is just an unfortunate phenotype due to bad genes. Beyond that why is it fair to favor people better due to what we define as a genetic disorder? You could look at height for example. If someone has a genetic disorder that causes them to under produce growth hormones theyll be short. If someone is just short theyll be short. Either way theyre short and either way with enough understanding of the genome we could bring them up to average height. Doesnt it seem unreasonable to treat only the person with the genetic disorder? If we assume that this is unreasonable and that we should treat them this opens the way for cosmetic genetic modification. Thats the slipper slope that might exist and why wouldnt it be a possibility? ,science,cqmou4o,0,t5_mouw

Catalytic converters force CO and incompletely combusted hydrocarbons to react with a metal catalyst typically platinum to produce CO and HO.

If so everyone agrees that most purported vestigial structures do have functions they arent functionless but the function has changed and the original functions eventually hashave been abandoned.  Thats good enough.I guess it depends upon how you define whale as well but whatever way you regard Basilosaurus Pakicetus Ambulocetus and the rest of the fossil ones the hind limbs that they had and that served a variety of functions are now reduced to a relict of their former functionality.  In modern whales the hips are there and the bones and muscles in question relate to them and are developmentally the same as limbs.  I dont see what the problem is with that interpretation.  If youre saying they are some kind of de novo structure thats completely independently derived that would be interesting and news to me.  References would be appreciated.If youre trying to make the point that this is all an interpretation sure Ill accept that.

3957133,0,t1_cr79ync,gt The assumptions youre making are most likely false.They arent.gt Given that the expert in the area has stated that the particles are clearly visible under SEM BTW x is possible using SEM under ideal circumstances... x would be more reasonable though youre probably wrong.Being visible using the secondary electron detector is not a guarantee of anything.  Secondary electrons are emitted from the very top few nanometers of the sample before multiple scattering events occur.  This makes high resolution images possible.  That is an important distinction in a scanning probe technique.  Magnification is a meaningless number.gtEspecially because the anomalies you mention require huge differences in focal volumes.Which are present once the beam undergoes multiple scattering.  Not focal volume per se but penetration depth.  Characteristic xrays are emitted from a far larger volume.  In something like pure Carbon for example the Carbon kalpha xray will be emitted from a volume as large as  microns and more or less that deep.  Probably the most instructive diagrams to look up would be phirhozeta distributions.  In a complex material this interaction volume must be accounted for as well as whether the scattered electrons still have enough energy to cause the transition of interest and the likelihood of xray reabsorption or fluorescence.  Its not a trivial problem and proper quantification requires the conditions I mentioned polished flat homogenous along with proper standards.gt If the thickness of the film is even close to an order of magnitude of the change in thickness then the data from EDS will be good enough for these purposes.I am unsure as to what you are attempting to say.gt If not then selected area EDS would still give pretty accurate data.Qualitative data.  Im reasonably certain thats all thats being asked of the technique in GSR analysis.  The presence of some combination of metals or light elements within a carbonaceous particle would be indicative of some gun powders or primer chemicals.  Full quantification isnt necessary.But this is the danger of EDX people assume that its the pointclickquantify analysis that it isnt.  Just because the software package will spit out semiquantitative analysis numbers for any spectrum collected doesnt mean that theyre any good.If youre looking for further information this is a good place to startA more formal treatment can be found here but youll need journal access,science,cr7chx5,1,t5_mouw

3984184,0,t1_cra2dkc,Fourth year nuclear engineering student and it was most definitely a design flaw in addition operator error. The plant was designed with a positive void coefficent. Water heats up causing boiling producing steam. The steam bubbles or voids are introduced into the coolant. For the RBMK which was water cooled but graphite moderated this reduced the amount of water coolant and thereby increasing the amount of moderator.Planned testing was being done at the reactor and it had been pushed back so a operator shift switch also occurred night shift was less familiar than day shift. The operators planned to be at  of their rated power. They also switched off the Local Automatic Control that automatically adjusted control rods and then withdrew all of the rods. The rods were tipped with graphite so when they were inserted the moderationinducing graphite displaced the light water not heavy water coolant causing another spike in power. Yes systems were disabled but the design was far from sound and I have heard nothing about visiting politicians in any of my classes or textbooks on this incident.,science,crafkom,1,t5_mouw

3995823,0,t1_crbilqw,Resistance training can have cardiovascular effects. Think about it what does cardio exercise typically imply? Elevating the heart rate...right? Well when you lift weights what happens? Your heart rate increases. Your heart rate will increase more rapidly with a higher intensity i.e. more weight however you can not perform a high intensity exercise for long without rest. This is essentially why you get a different cardiovascular adaptation from low intensitylong duration exercise compared to high intensityshort duration exercise. With that said you will still likely get adequate cardiovascular responses from resistance training as long as you train for long enough. The more sets you perform as long as intensity is adequate the more often your heart rate elevates. A minute to  hour workout should be adequate even with appropriate rest intervals interspersed.  Also as Lemming pointed out resistance training has an additive effect to cardiovascular training. This is because as I mentioned earlier it stresses the body in a different way. Your body adapts to stress. However it adapts specifically. When you alter the stress you alter the adaptation. Its Selyes principle of General Adaptation Syndrome.   However recent research has shown that strength may be a bigger predictor of mortality than cardiovascular fitness. Leg strength has been shown to be the  predictor of mortality even over VOmax. This is why resistance training is now being used for hypertensive and cardiac rehab patients in hospitals across the nation.

4000382,0,t1_crc909a,gt Well it seems youre switching arguments here a little bit by focusing on simplicity and quantifiability as important rather than ethical constraintsWell my point was that the ethical constraints arent as over reaching as they are in psychology. You can do a lot to figure out how something like a leg or a single cell works before you come anywhere near ethical considerations. The main difference is that biology studies a range of systems and subsystems that do not need to be worried about ethics. When I say simple and quantifiable I mean you can take a lot of things apart and modify them to see what happens and create comprehensive models. I dont mean the objects are simple themselves just our ability to de and reconstruct them makes them a more simple subject to study which is afforded to us at least in part by the fact that ethics dont necessarily hinder study.

They arent coauthors. As for  essentially every living experimental physicist has helped at least one of these authors with some part of this work.I think you fail to appreciate the sheer scale of the LHC project. If a specialist spends years of their life doing original demanding work with the sole goal of producing this paper and others like it why shouldnt they be an author?Physics might have a slightly lower threshold for authorship but it cant be much lower. A large fraction of the worlds experimentalphysics work is conducted at CERN and papers like this really are the culmination of all of that work.

Okay well then you have a very idiosyncratic idea of what science does which radically contradicts whats been pretty well understood since the enlightenment.The reason science rather than just dicking around with random arbitrary variables has made real material gains is that scientists have traditionally cared about the  actuallyexisting real world and the implications of what theyre doing.In fact the most successful idea of fruitful science has been to focus just on the relevant parts of reality needed to answer the biggest most meaningful questions to the exclusion of everything else. This is why physics achieves far greater depth than even the more legitimate social sciences. Physicists narrow things down to very very well defined limited phenomena that they can measure while excluding everything else and then test them with purpose. When things get too complicated they hand it down to the chemists who in turn hand it to biologists and zoologists and so on until eventually political theorists with different hats and pretenses are left holding the big bag of shit that no one else wanted.

4054232,0,t1_crhfuip,Hi Im a European who has graduated on American history and have lived and worked as a journalist on both continents. My answer would be this The United States is a very big and diverse country. It has a strong tendency to let all schools of thought flourish from hippies to the ultra religious pilgrims from orthodox Jews removing bike paths to successful cannabis legalization movements. Over the past fiftysixty years religious activism has had a outsize influence in politics. However the law is clearly at the side of science. In certain regions this still sparks controversy. Political gerrymandering look that one up   has given these regions an outsize influence in national politics. The controversy you read about is not so much about the United States going astray but has to do with the unreasonable power certain institutions have like school boards that are under the influence of these fringe religious activists. In general however things arent so bleak. Universities and certain government agencies in the  United States are  in the end   clearly some of the biggest scientific forces in human history.,science,crievv5,1,t5_mouw

4060269,0,t1_crj1bb3,You are welcome. And I see. Well when you cited yourself as the source of your information I assumed you were unaware. In your defense your outline covers a relatively large amount of time. I just happened to come across it in the mists of my studies so it is fresh in my mind. Especially Lomekwi  which is a discovery I have been anticipating for a while now. A couple more questions before I let you go how is saying that the Acheulean Industry is a progression form the Oldowan misleading? Are you suggesting the Acheulean is the result of convergent evolution? The Oldowan and Acheulean are surely distinct typologically but I think it is completely within reason to say that they are genetically related. I dont know about lumping and splitting within Early Paleolithics I think we first need enough data to split and lump! but I know that it is a point of contention within the early hominin fossil record though it is not as if we have any more data in that respect!. But I agree that there is evidence for an evolutionary trend of the Acheulean from the Oldowan though the factors which facilitated this change are still not completely identified.  There is indeed some evidence of usewear on the core forms which is not surprising to me as I am sure that early hominins had several uses for a pointed heavy instrument during the PlioPlesitocene. However the flakes definitely would have been most useful and the cutmarked bone found often in association with them gives us a at least one motive. And it is all right I dont expect other students of archaeology to have the same background or interests that I have I myself cannot tell you much about anything that happened in the archaeological record after  kyr and before  A.D. at length the Great Pyramids were built no?. So long as the correct information is being carried across I am satisfied.,science,crj3mz5,1,t5_mouw

4069487,0,t1_crk3uuk,This is true! I saw a documentary on the BBC about KFC and theyve got researchers investigating the effect of the food on people. They add certain chemicals to the food deliberately. For example EMonosodium Glutimate increases appetite and its added to so much junk food e.g. Chinese food Pringles. I dont think this is a coincidence. The food industry now is like the cigarette industry back a few decades ago..denying the negative impact of their products onto consumers. The food industry are actually profiting off the obesity crisis because they bring out diet products and tout low fat claims but what they dont say is that these products are full of sugarsweeteners and that sugarsweeteners will result in weight gain. So really its falsemisleading advertising. I also saw another documentary on the BBC which is available on youtube and it told how the EU parliament was going to regulate the food industry but then the food industry put pressure on the MEPs Members of European Parliament by saying oh this will hurt jobs and lo and behold the regulation reform was dropped. The food industry lobbies politicians on a regular basis. I saw that the same thing happened in the US. The US introduced a healthy eating plate but then Harvard designed their own healthy eating plate because it felt that the food lobbyists had played too big a role in the formation of the healthy eating plate. For example the US healthy eating plate talks about eating grains whereas Harvards plate emphasizes wholegrains as opposed to refined carbohydrates. Refined carbohydrates have been shown to lead to weight gain overweight and obesity. The US healthy eating plate has an emphasis on low fat diets whereas the Harvard plate talks about healthy fats such as olive oil. The corn industry in America is huge. I saw the documentary Food Inc and chickens and cows are now being fed corn instead of grass and this is leading to chickens that can barely walk and sometimes die because theyre being made to put on weight too much. Chickens and cows are supposed to eat grassthats their natural dietbut corn is cheaper because its subsidised by the US government. And corn is put into everything chemically e.g. dextrose etc and that really messes up with peoples health. Grassfed chicken etc is recommended but of course its more expensive so people on a lower income wont be able to afford it. The food industry knows thisthey essentially outprice the good food for the minority who can actually afford it and sell the crap food to poor people. Corn in its original form is actually a wholegrain but it shouldnt be given to animals like chicken or cows! And it shouldnt be turned into chemical crap because that just strips it off any nutritional worth and actually makes a toxic food product. Highly processed food will always be less nutritionally sound because theyre essentially stripping the goodness out of the food. Its cheaper to make and thats what the attraction is. The food industry does not care about peoples healththey just care about profit. Cows are also given antibiotics routinely and theres talk that this isnt healthy for humans..that are we in turn consuming those antibiotics? ,science,crk5e1f,2,t5_mouw

4128797,0,t1_crqvebn,I too am no quantum physicist but based on my understanding the reason we have a hard time wrapping our minds around this concept is because of how we interpret time. Since we are moving so slow in the spatial vector and so fast in the temporal vector time for us is a sequence of cause and effects  frame by frame  linear. However a particle experiences no movement in the temporal vector because its travelling at C.So hypothetically if a particle of light that left the sun was sentient the amount of time it would experience between leaving the sun and hitting the Earth would be  i.e. the entire travel would be instant. Based on this it would make sense at least to me that if something affected the particle along its trajectory say a grate floating in space around Venus any consequential distortions may be uniformly applied along the entire trajectory. For us it would seem like the particle is sending info back in time but from the particles prospective there is no cognizable difference in terms of the moment it passed Mercury and the moment it hit the grate around Venus as if it experienced all those moments or frames simultaneously. Just how I think about it as a layman. ,science,crqwny8,10,t5_mouw

Global access to information and ideas that are not conducive to their continued beliefs in the things their parents take for granted and never questioned. In seconds you can find very well written and thoughtinducing articles on any subject imaginable. The truth is that the freely available information on the internet has inculcated the concept into the minds of previously religious families that religion is a mythology just like the stories you read about Zeus and Thor. However this will have a drawback as religious fundamentalists get more savvy to the use of these technologies they will have a more and more adversarial attitude toward any expression of these concepts and will create virtual walled fortresses of their religion online.

The data they used to come to that conclusion stems from an article published over  years ago. I was quite young  years ago so I dont remember how media reported back then. But I find it difficult to understand why such a key piece of the research wasnt updated to recent times. It would be similar to someone doing a study on societies view of samesex marriage then using data from the s even though opinions have changed dramatically in the last decade. But I guess the end message remains true. Media influences the way people see the world and people create biases based on how they perceive the world.

4177588,1,t1_crwevyg,Of course if we know that CO has an impact natural cycles or not we can think about this more in depth. There are obvious variations and cycles of earths climate. The point of global warming is not that human made CO is the only or even main driver of global warming but that events which cause the natural CO and temperature balance including whatever natural cycles they go through to go a little bit awry will have great impact on the climate and species living in the environment at least in the short term. We know from the Permian extinction that a run away greenhouse effect though in this case caused by methane released from the ocean floor due to physical forces on the earth debate here over asteroid vs volcanic activity can lead to other changes within an environment beyond temperature that nearly wiped out life as we know it the Permian had a  species extinction rate.All perfectly natural. The external natural events though did break the usual balance out of whack maybe even just a little bit causing a positive feedback loop that led to near absolute destruction. Obviously life is still on earth and is thriving in a way it maybe never has before. Obviously the climate changed again thanks to the same natural cycles that have sustained life and the climate over milenia. It is entirely possible that the majority of the rate of change seen is totally natural. The problem is that even a little bit extra added on will totally change the outcome of the function and rate of change compounding as well over time exponentially. The majority of Climate change acceptors do not think man is evil or that the world is destroyed or that man is to blame for all that ails earth rather they worry that in the next  years things could get much much worse while we have the ability and knowledge to help make them better ,science,crwg7ow,3,t5_mouw

The main problem right now is with the not poor enough to be helped by government but not well off enough to not need help which makes up a large part of the population. However in many cases its actually a bad idea to be well off and need medical care.The reason its this way is mainly because of the way our Medicare works with private insurance and the way our EMTALA works. EMTALA is the law that prevents hospitals from dumping poor patients in need. Before this law some hospitals would refuse to treat indigent patients no matter how dire their need. I remember videos of patient dumping and that was before everybody had video in their phones.Its not that any of these is necessarily bad though its just that they they werent made to work together so in combination they set up perverse incentives which warp the cost and payment system.Combine all that with the political situation here and you get people saying Government cant do anything right generalized to all actions of all governments. There are people who actually believe this in the face of all evidence to the contrary.Those people are currently in power and doing everything they can to block a sensible solution or even to fix the system weve got.

Certainly criminals will still put in an effort to obtain weapons. But by preventing them from obtaining them legally you raise the transaction costs of acquiring a gun and by making it illegal for them to carry it without a permit you raise the expected cost of owning a gun i.e. the chance of being fined or imprisoned for possession of a weapon has risen from zero to some meaningful amount multiply whatever the costs those punishments are times that  and you have an approximation of the cost increase.Now those increased costs wont solve murders overnight or probably even meaningfully reduce the murder rate over the course of  years. But over time it is basic economics that as you increase the cost of something the quantity demanded will dwindle. And it seems basic logic that as the cost of gun ownership by criminals rises and the quantity of guns demanded by criminals dwindle thus raising the cost of committing a homicide its considerably more difficult to kill someone without a firearm that the homicide rate would fall.,science,cs5hopg,16,t5_mouw

This helps those who hate bridges destroy more bridges while it does serve to educate engineers on how to build better bridges it still gives some validation to those who hate bridges.

The need for RampD was mentioned notably in the context of AMR for development of new drugs diagnostics and vaccines and for NTDs supporting research on NTDs and importantly in coordinating RampD efforts. However surprisingly little reference is made to RampD for Ebola. Furthermore these issues are dealt with in silos and little reflection is given to the failures of the current RampD system to deliver appropriate tools for important public health needs. We need to see more concrete outcomes which we hope can and will materialize from the G and the next World Health Assembly.

4311231,0,t1_csbazjw,Cosmic inflation is an important aspect and pointing to metric expansion of space is also important but the thing people really need to have as a fundamental is that we live in an accelerating universe.The problem with saying big is the universe after cosmic inflation was relatively big compared to it before but the universe now compared to after cosmic inflation is still an immense difference  we arent just bigger we are magnitudes greater in size.This is why pointing to metric expansion of space is good but it again falls short in really showing just how quickly its expanding and thats why pointing to the idea of an accelerating universe is key its also my favorite because its how you can tell a fool when they say we live in an infinite universe. So the idea that is most important here is that the vacuum of space is literally bleeding out more space such that not only are objects moving apart from the momentum of the big bang but also the distance in between those objects is growing because space is being generated. More so by saying we live in an accelerating universe we are really stating how metric expansion of space is changing over time which is to say we live in a universe where the cosmic scaling factor is greater than zero.,science,csblov4,2,t5_mouw

A majority of past human attempts at engineering the environment have gone disastrously e.g. introducing kudzu to the American South as an attempt to fight erosion and if climate engineering goes wrong were all screwed.

4373240,0,t1_csil1ea,Well the title here might be a bit oversimplified. Its not one synapse that holds one memory but thousands and millions. And any serve more than one purpose not to mention more than one memory.Try to imagine a memory as a web of neural synapses and multiple webs can intersect andor overlap to various degrees. Something that triggers and inaccurate memory might tug on one point on that web or even an intersectingoverlapping web but eventually the pull activates the right web and you get the full memory.For example you remember what strawberries are and recalling that involves those parts of the brain involved in object recognition e.g. the areas of the brain that participate in taste sight etc. the areas of the brain that participate in bridging those sensory areas with areas responsive to reinforcement types etc.. And to take it up a notch remembering that time you ate strawberries at your grandmas house now includes the strawberry web as well as the grandma web the grandmas house web etc. And then when you mind starts to wander to conversations you had with your mother you start dominoing into other webs.And this makes sense if you think about how neurons work after achieving a breakpoint they are activated and send out neurotransmitters to the next neuron. In terms of webs you create a chain reaction. Fortunately we also have neurons specialized in inhibiting neural activity so our chain reaction doesnt end in epilepsy or some other similar disorder.,science,csillf4,1,t5_mouw

To achieve these goals a new research center dedicated to the study of vertebrate paleontology is being built while new expeditions are already schedule for  and . The Projecto PalNiassa aims to create a regional excellence center with regional and continentwide objectives.The Projecto PalNiassa organized multiple scientific expeditions to excavate vertebrate fossils in Mozambique namely in   and   and . These campaigns have been clearly successful and dozens of complete skulls and skeletons from synapsids and other reptiles have been collected prepared and described. Lately the description of the first fossil vertebrate species from Mozambique named Niassodon mfumukasi was collected and described by the Projecto PalNiassa international team. As a result of this international and multidisciplinary teamwork this fossil considered as a holotype was collected in Mozambique prepared in the USA CTscanned in Germany described in Portugal and is currently in display in Maputo at the Museu Nacional de Geologia.There is a strong commitment to intertwine Mozambican and international scientific communities in order to stimulate research and increase enthusiasm in Mozambican academia as well as those involved in such type of research in Southern and Eastern African regions by means of an invaluably important diverse and undescribed fossil record.Longterm Objectives To create a leading paleontological research center in Mozambique To stimulate research and entrepreneurship in geological sciences via Paleontology in Southern and Eastern Africa To prepare and study the vast amount of fossil material collected from previous and future expeditions To promote future excavations to discover new vertebrate fossil localities in Mozambique and contiguous countries To create strong institutional ties between Portuguese and American centers of excellence in paleontological research and their Mozambican counterparts To train new scientists and fossil preparators from Southern and Eastern African Countries. To train the MNG staff working in natural history collections. To organize educational projects conferences and workshops to cooperate with school teachers on Geology and Paleontology and geoconservation issues to enhance formal education system and bring environmental and geoconservation awareness among students.

Other issues from customer point of view is that there are other ways to prevent apples from browing and that browned apples while unsightly are still fine to eat.

While a student I took a very interesting class on plant molecular genetics and we studied several big GM crops in detail including golden rice roundup ready plants and mosaic virus resistant cassava.   One thing in particular that made me very interested in the field of genetic modification was the possibility of producing polyhydroxybutyrate PHB a degradable bioplastic in transgenic plants. This research has some very exciting green and sustainability implications.  I was wondering if Monsanto and other agricultural companies have started to investigate possible leads on this technology?

They report that these breaks facilitate dynamic changes in chromatin organization in a localized fashion with the precision of a single nucleosome.  Their findings demonstrate changes in chromatin structure within  nucleosomes of the promoter that promote accessibility of transcriptional activators.The difference between the older papers and Madabhushi et al  is that the transcriptional activators and RNA Pol II are already present before breaks form.   In Ju et al  RNA pol II isnt present until  minutes after treatment Figure A antiPolII .  So if chromatin is in a transcriptionally poised and decondensed state why is a DSB necessary for expression?Their suggestion is that it allows enhancer elements which may be millions of base pairs away to interact with these genes.,science,csk5n4u,1,t5_mouw

Youre missing the point the point is that when we rely entirely on tools and physical experiments we arent meeting our scientific potential. Rational deduction from a logical matrix is just as legitimate as experimental results the problem is that not everyone has the same capacity for the first method and that leads to communication issues. With experimental results you can offer proof to people who may not be fully capable of understanding how something works because you can repeatedly demonstrate that when you push the power button the computer comes on for instance. A toddler can grasp that without being able to understand how the computer itself or even the power circuit works.

In  the Commission identified the health risks of climate change and made crystal clear just how dangerous it is for human wellbeing.The  Commission was formed when we realised that everything that had been predicted and described in  had already happened What was needed next was to explore the pathways forward and a report to look at how responding to climate change can be good for public health.The analogy that was talked about at some of our preliminary meetings was that a health professional concerned about the health impacts of tobacco consumption would no longer be content with only looking at the biomedical links between tobacco and ill health the responsible physician would start to look at public health interventions that can be put in place to reduce consumption and minimise the harm to individuals.

And since that difference is smaller doesnt it mean we are retaining less heat?Edit yes it is. The phd made a tiny tiny error he meant that the difference is getting larger. Lets go through a simple exercise to demonstrate this the article states that the water is heating up therefore lots of heat is going in. However its also not cooling down or releasing heat. Therefore theres a net gain in heat.I.e  Heat in   heat out   heat remaining in the system The equation can be positive for heating or negative. If the difference is  then equal amounts of heat is entering and leaving the system.,science,csyew6a,0,t5_mouw

Id put that under accidental death along with car accidents and earthquakes. I think most people understand that miscarriages and failed implantations are things beyond our control. Its a nonstarter for a discussion on abortion.gt theyre forced to admit that in the early stages of growth the mothers life is clearly more important than that of the bundle of cells that represent a potential personIm with you on the priority of life discussion but you cant claim to understand the nuances of the science of pregnancy and then talk about a bundle of cells or a potential person.A fertilized egg is human life. There is no rational argument to be made here. Every human that exists began life as an embryo and every embryo is on its way to becoming an adult human being it doesnt stop at baby. At no point is the organism replaced. Its is on a continuous development path culminating in a fullgrown adult human being.Biological arguments about abortion e.g. cluster of cells hunk of flesh etc. are formed solely to emotionally distance oneself from the natural revulsion from terminating human life. They exist solely to dehumanize the organism to spare the psychological effects of deliberately ending the life.gt Eventually the question becomes when are we really talking about a person with all the rights to life of a fullgrown human and thats a tricky discussionIts nice when people recognize this. The only rational argument to be had about abortion is regarding legal personhood priority of life and the balance of individual rights. Plenty of people are capable of differing opinions on this.But biological arguments hold no place in the debate.

Ask a prolife person if the death penalty or life in prison would be appropriate for a person who has committed a premeditated murder one that was not in selfdefense one where someome actually hired a killer and was in attendance to see the act committed. Most Americans would. But ask if a woman that has had an abortion should be killed by the state or imprisoned without parole for the rest of their lives and youll get a different answer.  Penalties most people would be okay with applying to murderers seem naturally abhorrent when applied to women whove had abortions.

4571643,0,t1_ct6n629,Meg  Awesome to see youve used the interface and are mapping fans. Thats fantastic! Thanks for the question.  Do the best you can with those that are cutoff. Absolutely mark them. We cutup the large HiRISE images into smaller chunks that we show on Planet Four. We have about  pixel overlap between the image above and below and left and right.  So someone else will see the other image where the source isnt cutoff and likely mark it. But please do mark it. We combine the results from many classifiers to identify sources so having your marking for the edge sources helps us identify it and also some Planet Four images wont have that overlap since they are the edges of the full frame HiRISE image. So even if its the edge do your best to mark it. You can drag the marker to keep only part of it on the screen if that helps match its shape. ,science,ct6v6uz,1,t5_mouw

So the right answer ethically is as described previously  to not prescribe an antibiotic and attempt to help the patient understand why it wouldnt help them and might hurt them antibiotics like all medications have side effects and furthermore why we need Antibiotic Stewardship. This does work sometimes sometimes pisses the patient off but thats the worst of it but can lead to them leaving the practice going to some other doc or ER or Urgent Care for Antibiotics which if enough people do that threatens income and can lead to low patient satisfaction scores which many insurances tie into reimbursement payment amounts. Not that the above is to sound greedy but docs do go to a lot of school and have a lot of debt and more relevantly a ClinicOffice IS a business.

She saw how the women responded and how she was comforted but Mrs. Turkle said she felt awful. She believed that it was wrong to comfort someone with an entity that could not connect emotionally.

Watch what happens in the Midwest when a low pressure system comes through. It literally acts like a conveyer belt to transport moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to Oklahoma Kansas etc. At the same time a rain storm isnt just a big mass of water moving from one place to another. Its a disturbance in the atmosphere that causes disruption of air as it moves from one place to the next think of a snow plow driving through a snow covered road As it reaches area of increased moisture the resulting rising motion of that moist air causes it to release its water in the form of precipitation.

4675726,0,t3_3eret9,Hello Dr. Hawking.  I think one of the reasons people are worried about technology eventually harming humanity is because it is money that drives the research and development.  And most of us realize that the rich and powerful of our world are not concerned with eradicating disease and poverty.  They will likely use their money and power to develop AI and technology that will benefit their position and pocketbook.  If I am understanding correctly your plea to the public and campaign is that we make sure that the technology is used to benefit mankind and that we weigh all new developments with a perspective such as how will this effect employment? or how will this effect the environment?  Such as the current argument of how many professional drivers will lose their jobs when self driving cars and trucks become commonplace.  Will it be worth the proposed safety and environmental benefits?If this is correct how would you like us both the common people and the scientists to stand together against corporations with money and power who are often only concerned about the bottom line and shareholders?

And they will not be able to afford education because they dont have an income.Owners will not cut prices just because they can. Your credit card bill not go down by half just because stuff get done more efficiently the change if any will be small.This way you are increasing societys economic output as a whole but the rich will be richer and the poor poorer.

Essentially the growth process boils down to heating up the constituents until they vaporize and then letting the vapor condense on the Aucoated Si substrate.  Because of some very interesting thermodynamics the vapor only condenses where the Au is on the substrate and nanowires are grown.  As more material makes its way to the substrate deposition also starts to take place on the sidewalls of the nanowires and they become nanobelts and eventually nanosheets.By altering the positions of the source materials and the substrate within the furnace we can fairly precisely control the amount of each element that is incorporated into the devices although mechanizing this process would of course produce more consistent results.,science,ctl6vtk,5,t5_mouw

However for every obese women not gaining can in fact be a net loss as the weight of mom is converted into baby.We do recommend that women gain within the recommended guidelines.  I will also say that for women who meet with a dietitican in pregnancy like those with a new diagnosis of diabetes will often start a better eating program like quitting soda starting walking etc and initally experience weight loss in pregnancy. If the baby is growing well and mom is eating well from a good variety of foods then I look less at the total number of weight gain and more at the total picture. For very obese women those more than  lbs overweight there is data that weight loss was NOT associated with poor fetal growth while excessive weight gain WAS associated with babies being overly large macrosomic and a higher risk of cesarean delivery.

In actual fact phytoplankton are by far and away the biggest source of carbon storage.  They are algae which bloom on the surface of the sea.

4760697,0,t1_ctum27r,I think it all depends on how you define emotion. This has been the bane of emotion research for centuries and is the reason for a lot of conceptual confusion and mixed research findings.Indeed the most important problem you would have to consider when studying animal emotions is operationalizing emotion.  Which theoryies will guide you?  Off the top of my head I know some researchers who would say animals can experience emotions.  But others would say they dont.  And others would say that we cant know.   The main difference among them is their definition of emotion.As you noted you certainly could create a model that predicts emotions based on muscle activations but it would be difficult.  There are a good number of papers attempting to predict human emotions using data on psychophysiology facial expressions neural activity and more I dont know this literature that well actually. These models actually perform pretty well but still lack some accuracy. Moreover its not clear whether they can be applied outside of the context of that specific study.Re licking stamps A lot of the variability in human emotion that we see can be accounted for by culture social norms history language etc.  Nonhuman animals arent nearly this complex.  I think the only way to answer your question sufficiently though is to invoke the Conceptual Act Theory which very basically states that emotions arent carved in nature.  We dont have discrete modules in our brains for fear anger disgust etc.  Instead emotions are conceptual acts.  For example the emotion of fear is an interpretation of a situated affective experience e.g. feeling negatively and feeling highly aroused in the context of fleeing from a snake.  That is fear is just a concept that we use to organize a variety of similar but still heterogeneous instances.  This allows us to communicate our feelings and it facilities selfregulation. Thus because fear is just a concept according to this theory we shouldnt expect it to necessarily correspond to highly specific patterns of facial expressions physiology behavior experience or cognition.  Consider the concept bird it encompasses both the penguin and the sparrow yet these birds are very very different. Consider the concept fruit it encompasses strawberries watermelon coconut olives tomatoes etc. yet these are all very different. This is just like the fear concept.Note that this theory predicts that because nonhuman animals cant make conceptualizations like this they cant experience emotions.Not sure if I went overboard here or didnt quite respond to your comment correctly but theres a lot of interesting ground to cover!,science,ctumpjs,2,t5_mouw

4808727,0,t1_cu0m1pr,I read an article by Hansen where he advocated for a carbon tax and tariff fed into an energy tax credit. The net effect on personal liquidity would be nil.  But the effect on the electricity and energy markets would be simple. Lower carbon sources would become more favored by utilities than they are. Depending on the scale of the tax they may be more favored than carboniferous energy sources.It does depend on passing a straightforward bill  with little to no ridership to foul the flow of money. Cant bet on that happening.Meanwhile the  jurisdictions different preferences may mean that producers of carboniferous fuels go elsewhere. But because its a tax and tariff they wouldnt be less averse to our market. Other countries will achieve higher emissions profiles in the shortterm. This would likely be reversecorrelated to their GDP. But with the now uncontested cheap fuel their economies may improve. They may decide to pay for the luxury of clean air as China has started to.All in all i dont think its the worst idea  as good as any floated thus far.,science,cu0oha0,2,t5_mouw

It is between  and  or  and  and the closer to  the more tightly the data points will cluster around the line or the more the line is mathematically representative of the correlation of the variables. It is known as the Pearson productmoment correlation coefficient  the second image is a great visual for understanding what it represents.r can vary widely in how to interpret it depending on what youre studying. Generally in the physical sciences r values will be very high in biological or life sciences they are often much lower. It is very common in life sciences for r values of .. to still be indicative of some degree of dependence of the variables which would not be the case in a physical discipline.

4815908,0,t1_cu1kly2,gt If lab grown meat tastes the same and is cheaper then theyll be all for it.  One Im not super convinced on that. If some people are so pedantic that theyd eat more meat purely out of spite I dont see them eagerly adopting labgrown meat. And I have doubts that labgrown meat would not be required to be labeled or that animal meat wouldnt just start using voluntary labels and then people would buy that instead.  At any rate my real issue is that perfect labgrown meat especially that is cheaper than animal meat is a long way away. In the meantime there are literally dozens of meat alternatives on the market that are competitively priced and offer familiar textures and somewhat reminiscent flavors. However probably  of Americans have never even tasted one for whatever reason. I think we should be focusing on stuff like  existing alternatives and  not thinking every single meal has to have a big hunk of meat as opposed to saying lets do nothing until  years from now when hopefully grade A labgrown meat is  a pound.,science,cu1l1vl,1,t5_mouw

As the authors acknowledge this study is crosssectional and correlational limiting its interpretation in terms of establishing causation. The proposed sleepdependent model fits the study data statistically but there are plausible alternative hypotheses. For example amyloid deposition may affect memory and sleep simultaneously by disrupting their respective networks Fig. b. AD risk is related to increasing age genetics and environmental factors such as exercise and diet that influence AD pathology. Age is also associated with changes in sleep such as decreased NREM slowwave sleep and modification of sleep has been associated with changes in A in both mice and humans,science,cu2lzvd,2,t5_mouw

Were you referring to your computational collaborators?I am interested in learning how the computational group added to this research the article made the process seem a little bit backwards to me. Intuitively I would expect computer simulation to be done first and once the appropriate conditions are found through large amounts of iteration they could be verified with a physical experiment. Can expand on the role of the computational group in this finding?Additionally can talk a little bit more about the parameters that you tweaked before this experiment? How long did it take you to get this specific experiment to work? What did you expect from this specific experiment?One more question. You say that the parameter which controls molecular orientation is the ratio of the temperature of the glass and the temperature of the solid surface upon which the glass is deposited. Could it instead be more related to the speed at which the glass makes the transition from the original temperature to the final temperature AKA the time it takes to reach the appropriate T? I am about start a computational science Masters so I am really interested in the contributions that can be made to research from someone with that kind of background.

It is all theories and tests that are scaled to a tiny fraction of what the real problem is.Maximum of  years of data compared with the earths life which is in the millions.  A lab which is a tiny spec on the earth.  To be honest both side have nothing.  I tend to side with the deniers because that creates dialogue.  Most of the arguments I hear are that most scientists agree so you might as well agree.  Its like the equivalent of come on join the band wagon  What kind of scientific evidence is  percent are in agreement?  The  agreement is a technicality.

4954706,0,t1_cuj11lj,The article the Washington Post story references is behind a pay wall I think.

In his TED talk Lozano describes using PET to identify areas that are over or under active in people with depression  for example  and suggests that stimulating the under active regions will improve matters.  He says something similar for Alzheimers.  Im surprised that tickling these regions with electricity doesnt kill you or cause a seizure but there appears to be excellent evidence that some excitations cause positive effects.  But the mechanisms underlying all this seem only to be understood at this sort of handwaving level.    By the way this would make for a great AMA.Outside EM stimulation has been observed to cause increases in brain activity  lots of early empirical data about visual or other hallucinations showed something was happening  and the response to EM stimulation has been observed with fMRI.  Now devices are available that are designed to produce this in a controlled manner.    How is it happening?

If a stem cell was made to differentiate into a muscle cell it would for all intents and purposes be a muscle cell but it would by no means be something you could implant properly. The current issues with implants are that the bodys immune response recognizes the cells as foreign due to something called the major histocompatiblity complex MHC. This is unique with individuals and has huge variability. So if your own embryonic stem cells were use to produce a specific cell type it could possibly be implanted but there are still many issues with having a cell or tissue being implanted. By no means do I think it impossible but we are still a ways away from a full enough understanding to have grown implants.,science,cupfym9,2,t5_mouw

First of all what job hiring process is based solely on quantifiable qualifications? Ive done a lot of hiring and a large part of it is personality fit and intangibles that come out during the interview process and make someone just seem right for the job. Ive never seen a hiring based solely on number of certifications or years of experience. There are a multitude of things that you look for when hiring and adding a different ethiccultural perspective to your team is a perfectly acceptable criteria.This is true of colleges as well. Having a multitude of ethnic backgrounds is beneficial to all the students at the college because it prepares them for the diverse real world.

Because there is no such thing as a perfect direct replication wouldnt it be better to use the replication resources to find the boundary conditions for these effects?

5015413,0,t1_cuqcyfe,Very important questions. The short answer is that we do not know.  This is the first systematic effort to get an estimate in a field and it is not even definitive for psychology.  As you note the closest other estimates based on empirical data are reports of replication efforts in cancer biology by Amgen and Bayer.  As crude estimates those observed  and  replication rates.  However we dont know how to interpret those reports because none of the studies methods or data were made available to review.  In partnership with Science Exchange we are now conducting a Reproducibility Project in cancer biology detail here   We are also working with folks in a few other fields to develop grant proposals for Reproducibility Projects in their disciplines.  Our hope is that this project will stimulate systematic efforts across disciplines so that we can have better data on the rate of reproducibility and why it might vary across research applications.There are reasons to think that the challenges for reproducibility are pervasive across disciplines.  There are many reasons but a common one is that the incentives for researcher success are pushing toward getting published not getting it right.  We talk about this in depth here  .  Is psychology unfairly targeted?  Well if people are using the Reproducibility Project to conclude that psychologys reproducibility problem is worse than other disciplines then yes because we dont yet have evidence about differences in reproducibility rates.  As for myself I think the main story of the Reproducibility Project is a positive one for the field  the project was a selfcritical community effort to address an important issue that people in the field care about.  Science is not a publicity campaign it is a distributed effort to figure out how the world works.  The Reproducibility Project is just an illustration of that in action.,science,cuqjpon,79,t5_mouw

5056628,0,t3_3k8br7,Hello Dr Stuart Kim! I have long thought that it is not so much the genetic variable that is responsible for extended life as much as diet altitude latitude and exposure to nature. For example I remember watching a short documentary years agothat I cant find but will keep looking for about a small French town with a staggeringly high amount of centenarians. One of the common themes of this town was a high level of butter used in the cooking and that a duck or chicken basted constantly in butter was one of this towns dishes. I have noticed that the old people I know that eat classic food are a lot more alert and healthy than the ones eating weird soyoil based food and other highly processed foods which I know is anecdotal but definitely reinforces for me at least that there is some validity to this claim. What do you think?EDIT Sorry forgot to mention why I believe altitude plays a significant role due to oxygen content of the atmosphere. Oxidization from what I understand is one of the ageing mechanics so it would on the surface at least seem like being exposed to less oxygen would help you live longer.,science,cuvijdj,4,t5_mouw

It wasnt all willy nilly however at first I was given the option to have it in ampules for injection rather than the OxyNorm instant release capsules. There was that moment sitting in the doctors office my dad sitting next to me and being confronted with the situation Id always fantasised about the doctor prescribing injectable Opioids legitimately. Except I knew I shouldnt do it and that if I did it might end very badly... so I opted for the capsules. Ill admit I opened a few up and sniffed some but that was in the first weekfew days.

With methadone you know how much youre getting whereas it can be crapshoot with heroin. Or you can be buying Fentanyl which can leave addicts dead with the needle still in their arm. And no methadone doesnt always cause problems with long QT time. Its an issue you only see with methadone patients on high mg dosages its easy to detect with a  min. ECG. In Scandinavia the usual practice is to switch the patient to morphine instead of methadone.As for pharmaceutical heroin its used in some countries in Europe but also have its own problems. Primarily that unlike methadone which can be given daily heroin patients need to come to their clinic three times a day to shoot up.

Economists dont just sit around and ponder this stuff over morning coffee and then publish a paper saying that its just the way it is.For example you can take the most basic thing that everyone knows about economics the laws of supply and demand and behind that theory were a number of economists who had to prove that an increase in demand has a causal relationship with an increase in equilibrium price. ,science,cv9cr08,10,t5_mouw

In the healthcare sector there is no freedom to choose your care such as in a life threatening situation where you may have lost all mental faculties consciousness or may be in dire physical need of emergency attention. Therefore the healthcare market cannot be capitalistic in nature. You cant choose due to the nature of saving a life.

5208955,0,t1_cvdudx1,Maybe but I can see a few issues..  What happens to this material at high temperatures?  A tire is a bunch of different components but cured as one so itd need to be able to withstand C without changing properties or melting as that would cause it to migrate..  Where would it be put?  Wherever it is put youre looking at a non homogenized piece of the tire an extreme weak point because its not cured to the rest of the tire.  So putting it directly under the tread would probably cause tread seperation or belt or inner liner wherever it is put in the tire.  This would massively decrease the service age of the tire not to mention the danger. And putting it on the inside might work essentially outside the rest of the tire but how does it react in air?  Oxygen degrades rubber so if you put it on the inside it might degrade after a short amount or it might just fall off because its not cured to the rest of the tire..  It would add weight to the tire and with the fuel efficiency regulations coming about thats very important.  Rolling resistance for a tire can seriously decrease a cars fuel efficiency.None of these problems are insurmountable but it would takes years of experimenting testing and probably other new technology to make this viable from an economic technological or environmental viewpoint.  And these are just issues I thought of in a short time.  So like I said previously neat concept but not quite there yet.,science,cvdve3p,20,t5_mouw

The look of confusion when a child is provided with a rich explanation of a thing is often avoided by parents seeking an easier path to address an inquiry. We can invest in our childrens understanding of language by being keen to provide a more complete message then helping them elucidate their understanding with more familiar simpler terms. Every question is an opportunity to refine understanding and we shirk our duty as parents when we speak too crudely.There have been many strengths of our species that have been shown to be common to our primate cousins. Some species of primate have been shown to be capable of a sense of self. Some species have been shown to be capable of teaching their young simple tasks.I think humanity differentiates itself by our ability to abstract concepts through verbal communication and mathematics. We can communicate across many generations through oral and written language to share our understanding of society and nature. I posit that being able to share the representation of a sense of reality in thought is our defining strength as humans.,science,cvgow6i,3,t5_mouw

5255568,0,t1_cvjgdmz,I believe climate change is happening and in part because of human activity.Heres the rub I have with some of it. Are the effects going to be extensively negative on the ecosystem? From what Ive read CO enrichment can increase plant growth speed by up to  when reaching CO levels of ppm. Continuing on this scientists are constantly worried about the positive feedback loop that we are seemingly establishing because Water Vapor is the most dangerous greenhouse gas and as the temperature increases so does the amount of Water Vapor. Increased plant growth would seem to offset this in some way or another by providing negative feedback in that loop.  Lastly will we be in an ever warming atmosphere or will it revert back to an ice age as it has in years past? Lets say we turn our planet into a place of constant thunderstorms and clouds due to all the water vapor. I havent seen any articles on whether or not we will reach a point in which the thick upper level clouds from persistent thunderstorms will be enough to reverse the effects of global warming. Short wave radiation is reflected by the thicker cloud types that we see in the lower parts of the tropopause.If you look at the vostok ice core samples you see a pattern of rapid rise in global temperatures followed by a slow decline with dips and surges in temperature. My theory is that the increased convective activity in combination with other factors ice sheets... I dont know much about all that stuff so I cant speak to it will provide negative feedback to the positive feedback loop and bring global temperatures back into the normal range.,science,cvjhfo4,-1,t5_mouw

It seems to me we should be talking about the QUALITY of the science not so much the quantity. Scientific research is about learning new things. As we discover things the head count of people knowing this new knowledge goes from  to  and then hopefully rapidly to many more. But just before and just after that discovery the QUANTITY of scientists who dont know ie who are incorrect is close to . Copernicus is an example. He theorised the Sun was at the centre of the universe. If you did a straw poll at the time . of scientists thought the Earth was. Thats a large number but they were wrong. On the other hand Im not sure how one would go about discussing the quality of research. ,science,cvjjd5r,1,t5_mouw

I mean we dont know that it was just  that went extinct either.The question being asked is are we comparing known extinction count over known species count or just the the extinctions counts.Even if there were over  species at the time the asteroid hit if we dont have records of all of them but we can say with some certainty that  of the known species went extinct in the first century following the asteroid thats still probably a travesty regardless.,science,cvltbkz,3,t5_mouw

5305781,0,t1_cvpv6wr,Thanks for being understanding. Theres nothing quite like having a discussion with someone with opposing views.Well Im not saying it disproves God. Im just saying that things we used to explain through various religions like why the sun rises seasons weather natural disasters cause of both mental an physical illness now have better explanations through science.For every scientific progression religions domain becomes a little bit smaller.About if the perception of experiments are accurate. If the conditions are the same any experiment can be replicated. So there are a set of rules in the universe. A set of constants.And I think this is what youre asking about. Why these constants exists and why they are exactly those numbers? My answer is why does it have to be a higher intelligence that created these? Did they even get created? Can not something be existing without having been created at some point? I think this can be scientifically explained some day when our understanding of time and light has progressed.As many people probably have told you already. The burden of proof for Gods existence lies with the one making the claim not those who are skeptical. So far I see no proof of God.Ill leave with a quote from someone I admire immensely.What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

Intelligence doesnt shield you from the negative effects of arrogance quite the opposite intelligence is a feature arrogance is a behavior. Many Nobelists started doing pseudoscientific studies later in their life fueled by their arrogance that whatever they do must be scientific because theyre famed scientists. But science doesnt work like that. Science isnt what a scientist says its what can stand legitimate criticism from other equally good scientists. A good scientist is always in a very precarious position just about to be proven wrong.

5329236,0,t1_cvsum9t,E. O. Wilson and others have suggested homosexuality might be beneficial and explained evolutionarily through an inclusive fitness model. Take for example the grandmother hypothesis which suggests the reason female humans do the absolutely bizarre thing of  ending reproduction halfway through our lifespans menopause is because they can then focus energy resources and time on grandchildren. And that this has a marked impact on the fitness of those grandchildren as seen in a number of studies. So while most animals reproduce until they drop it actually improves the odds of my genes getting on further down the lineage if I stop reproducing and begin investing in grandchildren who of course carry  of my genes. Similarly aunts and uncles share  of their genes with their nieces and nephews. So it is possible that periodically having an aunt or uncle who doesnt invest resources energy and time into their own offspring and instead diverts that to nieces and nephews may actually result in a higher likelihood those shared genes survive another generational leap. One of the problems with this suggestion though is that it is a fairly modern and Western view of homosexuality. When we look historically and crossculturally people arent necessarily pair bonding or multimate bonding in the case of polygamy because they find one another sexy. It is primarily about having children and secondarily about what that bond means politically amp socially. Arranged marriages and marriages for economic political and religious obligations were the norm and still are in some regions. Often individuals are also not considered real adults until they produce children. Even in many hunter gatherer societies coupling and sex is about making babies and not pleasure. For example Hewletts work on the Aka showed that they had frequent sex  times a night every third night but described it solely as an obligation in order to make more children. In other words people werent coupling just for sexy fun damn youre hot time. They were coupling for children and many people were and still doing so with partners they werent necessarily sexually attracted to. Many societies do have spaces for people who choose not to reproduce or are not allowed to reproduce but we typically dont see that in small scale societies which is how we spent most of our evolutionary history. ,science,cvsvczr,22,t5_mouw

5352980,0,t1_cvvuu0j,No. Xray scans only differentiate between atoms not molecules. This is because the energy is so high in order to penetrate through the body that molecules arent even visible to the xray it has a small interaction cross section only individual atoms can block them.So this means you cant tell that theres gunk carbon vs. body tissue carbon. Maybe if the concentrations were incredible different but even then detecting carbon isnt really easy in the body due to its low Z number how big the nucleus is.And if you look at the periodic tableMost of the elements in your body are low Z. Not likely to block Xrays at all and when you do it is not possible to differentiate between carbon and oxygen or hydrogen without also using a low enough dose of xrays not to kill the patient. Calcium stands out. Thats why we tend to use Xrays on bone fractures. But if you look at iodine its even better. Thats why we inject it to detect coronary blockage and whatnot. Im not a doctor. However there are methods of separating bone and tissue with xrays. I wont get into that because it involves taking two xrays of different energies profiles because each atom responds to different energy xrays differently and then you subtract out the images. Whoops there I went.So the carbon from the soot would be indistinguishable from your lungs.MRIs may be able to work better. MRIs can work on low Z atoms because they work much differently.

5379289,0,t1_cvz7mtk,Agreed with the second point.To the first let me clarify You are correct in stating that in socialism one is paid what their labor is worth.To that degree it is safe to say that doctors contribute to society a great deal so should be compensated by society a great deal. However it is also safe to say the same for farmers. In fact one could argue that farmers are more important than doctors.Point is Socialism benefits society while capitalism benefits the individual. Among other forms of economies of course. Which is better? Its hard to say. Id argue that the good of society outweighs the good of the individual but both can work to the benefit of the other. It all just comes down to what your fundamental beliefs are really. But IMO socialism is more fair.

5441631,0,t1_cw6yil3,It can feel that way depending on what you learned previously and how the TED speaker links together what you already know.Sometimes this happens in regular college courses hopefully at least once to every student when a particular class makes all the classes before it in that area of study suddenly assume their places on a tree of knowledge and it all makes sense.  Its a wonderful powerful moment when it happens.TED talks are meant to make people think and they do this wonderfully.  I think its their impact combined with a casual audience that tries to turn them into something theyre not  a better way of teaching and learning that seems much more effective than regular learning.  It has to do with the emotional desire for knowledge.  The statement Knowledge is power is true and almost every person wants a little more power over their life and world.People who hear a high impact speaker as in a TED talk tend subconsciously to not want to think hey that was a neat talk and then go on with life.They want to believe that this talk in some measure changed the course of their life.  They want to believe they now know more than they did.  They want to believe they understand.  The alternative simply expressing that they listened to an interesting speech that is now over is far less emotionally appealing than having received a revelation.Having secret or advanced knowledge is emotionally appealing as is the elitist feeling of having been a person smart enough to listen to a talk not everyone has listened to and understood.People want to believe theyre special so they tend to take TED talks as life changing events instead of nice podcasts to listen to in traffic.  This is not entirely a bad thing since it can awaken a hunger for more knowledge. ,science,cw77z4v,57,t5_mouw

Its not that things dont change its that they dont change in the same way that single isolated particles do such as a photon in a dark room.  The macroscopic effects of bulk materials and of materials in the semiclassical region such as transistors are all explained ultimately by these quantum mechanical laws.This paper talks about Rubidium atoms in an optical trap.  Classically we expect these to not be able to move from their position in the lattice like an egg in a carton because they dont have enough energy to get to the next lattice point.  However quantum mechanically we say that each atom isnt a point its spread out over an area and everywhere in that area has a probability of finding an atom there.  This can include the next lattice point over even if its somewhere the particle couldnt get to classically.  So sometimes we look and the particle is in the next point over because there was a probability of it being there.  The longer we avoid looking at it the further this probability cloud spreads and the further away we could find the atom.These researchers continually looked at the atom and every time they looked they reset the cloud which we call collapsing the wavefunction probability cloud.  This kept the quantum mechanical effects from taking over and the atom tunnelling through the lattice to the next point.  Since the atom also couldnt move classically it was stuck.,science,cwar2j8,2,t5_mouw

5483957,0,t1_cwcd4pv,gta lot of nonwestern cultures dont find minor keys sad for instanceIve always wondered about this.  It seems to me that a large part of why minor keys are considered sad is because people write sad songs in a minor key which they do because minor keys are considered sad...I mean most of the examples of the effect Ive seen on the internet change things like the tempo instruments and vocal style when adapting a song into minor key.Consider for example this adaptation of Blackbird into minor key.  In addition from changing from major to minor the guitar is replaced by piano and the tempo and pattern of the lyrics is altered.  Now I understand that the artist in question isnt making these adaptations to demonstrate the sad feeling of minor key and is deliberately changing these elements in order to increase the sadsomber tone of the piece.  But i do think that this is representative of most of the cases where you can hear the same songpiece in a major and a minor key e.g. minor key adaptations of theme music in gritty or dark reboots,science,cwcmkax,3,t5_mouw

5501830,0,t1_cwe6ubo,I wasnt referring to mapping signals sent along the cortex I meant signals sent along the nerve.  From what I read Hubel and Wiesel did cortex induced testing not testing with the nerves themselves.  What Im suggesting is monitors on the nerve as the signal passes thru the nerve from the retina to the thalamus we record the signal strength frequency velocity etc and associate that signal with whatever stimuli we put in front of the individual.  There wouldnt be any EKGs involved since most information at the cortex level isnt complete information.  We may be able to understand what the image is supposed to be or have an idea of it but we cant see what the image is or was just based on information we receive from the cortex.  This is because some processing along nerves is done while the signal is en route we yank our hands from fire without necessarily knowing its hot and some is done at the thalamus.  If some theories are proven fact then the information we get from the cortex the electrical pulses measured here is actually our brain cross referencing the current stimulus with previous stimuli.  Walks like a duck talks like a duck I must be seeing a duckSecond The optic nerve isnt as complex as Im getting from your definition.  This is a cross section of the optic nerve.  Each eye has  quadrants that send their signal down specific nerves. Diagram  This much we know.  The optic nerve itself is . mm the size of a normal  gauge earring and increases to . mm in some areas.  So its not exactly microscopic.  The arrays we have available currently are th of a mm.  and The max arrays they have now combine  of these to form grids for larger areas.  The cochlear nerve used for hearing implants is roughly the same size and we make due with a . mm electrode.  So its feasible to make one designed for the optic nerve.Your third point seems to be in a different direction.  The electrodes Im talking about would be connected to the optic nerve somewhere between the retina and the thalamus.  As far as their ability to read and write theres not much to read and write by the electrode itself?  The electrode would be connected to a port on the body that would be attached to a computer to handle the reading of the signal.  And electrodes we have today are capable of measuring electrical pulses as evident in many tests.  As far as writing this too would be controlled by an outside source that would regulate the pulse and send it via the electrode to the nerve where its carried to the brain for processing.  Heres the base idea in an easy to follow thought.A webcam is connected via HDMI cable to a computer.  I tap into the signal being sent along that HDMI cable.  If I take the signal and record it.  Then recreate the signal as best I can.  Could I remove the camera and send the signal along that cable where I tapped into it.  Would the computer be able to tell the difference between what I sent it and what the camera saw?The only ever response is its too complicated or its too tiny but its not.  Its the same size we work with regarding other implants.  They have retina implants that essentially do this.  But why not take it a step further database it and use that information to create countless new technologies. Think the Matrixedit typo,science,cwews7c,1,t5_mouw

It not only fed them but salted cod was caught salted and sold all over the world and made the New England fisheries some of the richest in the world. This goes all the way back to early colonial times. I know that even in my lifetime I have seen the cod numbers vastly decrease.  When I was young big cod were easily caught and were large and in big numbers.  Now when I catch a cod it is very rare and usually cause for celebration as they are one of my favorites to eat.  I used to catch them almost every time I went fishing in the ocean and now I only catch a few a year.  They are fewer and further out.  Its really sad as the cod was once a staple fish of New England and specifically Massachusetts and that is becoming a thing of the past.,science,cwhphhh,19,t5_mouw

5533735,0,t1_cwixjc6,That is perhaps partially true. To simplify a bit Cancer is made of cells that are like the other cells in your body except for a few bad changes that have made them replicate out of control. For example perhaps some of the cells that make up the lining of your intestines have turned into a cancer. These cells naturally have to replicate a lot because they tend to fall off as your digested food flows by and get swept away. If on top of that you damage the part of the cells DNA that governs how often it replicates it may start to replicate too fast and too often thus creating a mass.Again this is a bit of an oversimplification  for one thing the most common path to cancer is actually damage to the error correcting function of the cell. Once your error correcting doesnt work right you start to collect a bunch more errors some of which might then impact the part of the cell that governs how often it should replicate.The authors of this paper claim to specifically be able to detect actual cancer i.e. whether or not there are cells in your body that have gone through this whole process accumulated a bunch of errors and are now so damaged and full of errors that they are replicating out of control.,science,cwizeux,3,t5_mouw

5535040,0,t1_cwiauyo,If understand your question correctly I would restate it asgt What chemical signal would prompt the bacteria to seek out the infected area?IE Those chemical signals would also have to be discoveredmanipulated before this putative superhero bacteria could even be put into action.The article does not speculate on that but from the OP articlegt Ayres team discovered that during an infection by the pathological bacteria the E. coli left the gut and moved into the fat tissues to induce protective responses that nourish the muscles.gt Normally mice with lung and intestinal infections see a drop in a hormone known as insulinlike growth factor  IGF a molecule that signals the body to retain muscle mass. But the protective E. coli activated the IGF pathway in the fat tissues maintaining normal IGF levels and maintaining the animals muscle in spite of the pathogenic infections.gt The Salk team further found that the E. coli strain was activating the IGF muscle maintenance pathway through an intermediary a molecular complex in cells known as the inflammasome. Part of the bodys innate immune system the inflammasome responds to an infection by triggering inflammation in the infected area to destroy the offending microbes. The E. coli used this same alarm system to tell the body to maintain IGF levels and hence muscle mass.So there are complex chemical interactions that seem to act as signals between all these cells but keep in mind that the cells are not truly consciously talking to each other. The system just kinda works mostly ya know?I kind of see this as a possible example of parasitismevolvestomutualism coevolution where some sneaky bacteria have been tolerated because they were pretending to be helpful to the host system by mimicking some chemical signals? then eventually became part of the usual help system so now they are actually helpful.

The people are saying how much they love them comparing them to American cultural figures and one teen says that hes not for murder that hes prolife but if he could be a mass murderer he would Mickey and Mallory.The host them goes on to say that the viewers in tv land dont remember things that this is all junk food for the brain.The movie is very graphic an intense but it really makes a statement about this type of thing IMO,science,cwnqc0n,2,t5_mouw

In reality you should start with very short high intensity bouts of  seconds or so with . minute  rest and as your fitness improves then increase the duration of high intensity work or keep initial intensity fairly low for  minutes and build intensity as fitness improves. Im surprised to see this as HIIT training was huge nearly a decade ago but is apparently making a resurgence in popularity. Its great for helping you improve fitness and burning a lot of calories in a short amount of time and if you work hard enough youll definitely experience EPOCExcess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption the rest of the day which does feel great.

If you are in an accident and receive a concussion and are fine in three days that still counts as a head injury for statistical purposes. So does a traumatic brain injury that leaves you incapable of caring for yourself or dead.The marching point of the articlegtWhats clear though is that theres no justification for health or safety professionals to bang on about cycle helmets as if they were a panacea.  Their focus needs to be on reducing the risk of collisions occurring in the first place by reducing traffic volumes and speeds creating safe and cyclefriendly roads and junctions tackling bad driving and reducing the risks from lorries.

If the methodolgy was solid enough that a positive result would be publishable a negative result should be equally valid specially if the methods are discussed in detail to allow subsequent experimenters to distinguish possible confounding variables that might have yielded a negative.Thats a great advantage of publishing negatives sucessively controlling the experiment until either were certain enough of the negative or were certain enough of the positive. A researcher reads X conditions dont lead to M and maybe tries condition Y instead again finding the experiment under Y conditions doesnt lead to M while finally someone might realize you need a certain control to finally verify that under conditions Z you observe M.It can in principle be a huge time and cost saving tool for science provided the condtions of adequate discussion of methodology for negative results.From a more mathematical perspective the hypothesis A causes B has nothing special compared to A causes not B  just think of A leads to C where Cnot B.,science,cwth0ml,13,t5_mouw

5652920,0,t3_3siy92,Hi Alberto thanks for the AMA. Im looking into doing sustainable engineering as a PhD so Im looking forward to your answers. I believe wars could be fought over water this coming century if were not careful so thank you for the work you do!So Ive always wondered about how the international space station recycles all of its water. Their efficiency is impressive. Would it be possible to take that technology and adapt it to work in a single unit one that you could sell to individual households much like we do home appliances today? Therefore each house would be able to recycle as much water as possible in a highly local way. All the showerbathtap water and urine from houses skyscrapers and businesses recycled. Even a small uptake would have an immediate effect on relieving pressure on the sewers and increasing urban water efficiency.edit wording,science,cwxst7h,2,t5_mouw

5695703,0,t1_cx32j6b,No I think the argument that every job requires production and therefore pressure on scientists is no excuse for falsification makes sense. I dont disagree with what youre saying about the flaws in the system but your counterargument is essentially based on  excusing scientists for prioritizing money over integrity in the face of institutional pressures  claiming it isnt necessarily intentional to cheat the system implying that these falsifications are not still problematic and the responsibility of the scientist and  saying that knowledge of there being a lack of replication studies makes it easy to falsify data.None of these arguments differ from the arguments that could be made in order to justify cheating to get ahead in any other position. Unless we think that personal integrity and individual responsibility have no place in professional ethics then we cant excuse scientists for falsifying data any more than we can excuse anybody else from unscrupulous practices There are plenty of jobs where there would be a financial benefit or maybe even the threat of unemployment motivating individuals to be dishonest.  Many individuals face scrutiny if their work is not up to a certain standard even if they meant well. We cant assume that a good possibility of getting away with acting unethically is an excuse to act unethically. Would a detective be excused for planting evidence in order to make an arrest just because it would be easy to pull it off?I understand that youre talking about the issues with the current approach to publication but the environment around scientists does not change the fact that they should be responsible for their actions to the same extent as anybody else.

They have many clues that it exists but no clue what exactly it is.The universe is still a collection of objects but every single thing is connected to that outer layer. That connection also allows things like entanglement and wormholes work  this is what they mean by wormhole is equivalent to entanglement.

That is why I know that trying to define groups on allele frequency only works if there are alleles that are differentialy represented between the groups. Because Irish and British populations are not well isolated gene flow between groups because there is s history of admixture and because the populations did not diverge until relatively recently in human history the odds of finding alleles that are differentialy represented in each group is going to be challenging. And it is extremely unlikely that any combination of such alleles will provide the statistical power necessary to sort individuals into either an Irish or British group with any reasonable level of confidence.,science,cx3ih1w,10,t5_mouw

5729121,0,t1_cx707m1,gt Is it not the case that the arrangements of these cells and their neighbors form the initial filtering for this secondary processing? Yes this is correct. RGCs are already organizing the information from photoreceptors at the level of the retina and this organization is exploited by the brain to infer motionshapeetc.gt Im not suggesting that the eye or the optical nerves are doing any kind of processing in of themselves but that they are designed to detect certain shapes preferentially by virtue of their arrangement.I would think of this the other way around. The visual system is designed to exploit the organization and nature of the retinal ganglion cells.gt I was taught that was the explanation behind certain line based optical illusions that theyre artifacts of the arrangement and firing of cells on the retina rather than how the brain processes that information.This cannot be the whole explanation behind illusions like the MullerLyer illusion because we know that context affects illusions. Even expectation about the color of an impending stimulus can bias your initial perception of it. Ultimately it does not make sense to speak of the eye being subject to illusions independent of the brain since the ganglion cells are just giving you binary signals from their receptive fields. The brain is necessary for any subjective sense of length shape motion etc.,science,cx794jm,1,t5_mouw

I have to first hear what it is I want to play what sounds then execute the techniques that achieve those sounds without including anything that distracts from where Im taking the audience and hear that Ive executed it correctly while hearing and preparing the sound that comes next. All the while Im listening to the other musicians to coordinate the sound I produce with the sounds they produce. The feedback loops are not strictly serial but instead overlap. And quite possibly Ill be singing so I have to provide the same feedback loops to the voice that I provide to the instrument. The ear may not be magic but it is magical.So you can focus your attention on multiple things and react to them? Thats not magical nor your ear thats your brain processing the information from your ear. The ear is a microphone plugged into the main computer and is not responsible for managing information received only to pass it along. Musicians are better at distinguishing different music tracks and notes this is obviously not because the ear bones have gotten better at determining the difference they still vibrate the same way they always did whats better is your brains perception of the information given to it.gtDont equate something as complex and refined and well understood as music with something as simple as binaural beats by attributing the outcomes to the same cause called Placebo effect. It disrespects both the power of music and the power of placebos. Hearing is one of our brains most complex processes engaging across several areas of the brain to interpret and assign meaning to something that is physically nothing more than pressure waves propagating through a gas albeit very complex pressure waves.Ah I think Ive found the real thorn. Im sorry you think Im diminishing the power of music perhaps I should have been clearer but what I meant was that binaural beats and music both work the same way the effect is entirely caused by the individuals interpretation of the received information.gtThe placebo effect can be just as complex and real but less understood. Were just starting to have a scientific look at positive psychology within a neuroscience framework. We dont understand it but we can see and measure the effects e.g. male athletes have a rise in testosterone levels AFTER they win a competition. Stay tuned.Ive acknowledged that we dont know how specifically the placebo effect works. As far as looking at psychology from a neuroscience framework they drilled into peoples skulls in ancient egypt to cure people of these psychological diseases. They thought they were caused by demons but whatever. If you mean from a chemical perspective Ill agree its been a deal less time but when you think about it the first psychiatric medications came out in the s so its been about  years since then. Dont disrespect the history of scientific progresses made in the field.gtAs for binaural waves they sound like an early attempt to do for the brain what a pacemaker does for the heart. It may prove valuable someday for something. The odds are against it not because its a stupid idea with no merit but because most ideas just dont pan out. Panning out is long hard work and can depend on knowledge that has not yet been acquired. Ill reserve judgement. After all were having this conversation through something made from silicon sand who thought that up.They were an early attempt before they were tested now we know them to not work. They have already not panned out. The hearts pacemaker is the sinoatrial node a clump of neurons which are the origin of the hearts beat signal. The SA node is the direct cause of the hearts beat. As Ive stated brainwaves are our measurements of the electrical activity happening in the brain. They do not cause the brains processes they are the result of them.gtThe practice of medicine is just that a practice with trial and error. Its an experiment with a big learning curve. Like musicians physicians know what outcome they want to see and they create techniques to achieve that outcome. Like musicians many historical physicians have said what happens if I do this and most of the time they stepped in shit but sometimes they discovered something of great value to someone. Aurothioglucose comes to mind. Injecting metal into a knee joint to treat the symptoms of arthritis sounds kind of dodgy even for   but it worked sometimes. By now someone has likely figured out why.From Wikipedia on AurothioglucosegtThroughout history gold was used to cure diseases although the efficacy was not established. In  gold drugs were reported to be effective for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although many patients reacted positively to the drug gold thioglucose was not uniformly effective.As far as medicine being a process of trial and error everything involving knowledge is. You cant know what works without knowing what doesnt work unless someone teaches you and then you dont know for yourself for sure and checking to see if what you think works really does.Heres a great article about it Heres a video posted by a binaural beats channel where they dont tell people what its supposed to do and instead ask them to comment whether or not they felt anything and what they felt. Hilariously enough one commenter even says This one was mildly soothing which I would expect. I do not think there is any doubt that this sort of thing works though I think it can only be verified anecdotally. You can see the variation in the responses some had no effect some were calmed some got headaches or became upset as well as various other reactions. This helps illustrate the fact that they dont consistently work for everyone. In contrast medicine proven to work works on the large majority of people in the same way. The relaxed reports can also be explained by something the article I linked mentions typically binaural beats are added with white noise which by itself has a calming effect on many people. Youll notice this channel also has a SHITLOAD of videos posted after the one I linked. This illustrates how successful and easy to make these binaural channels are. Youll also notice the claims made by believers in binaural beats are wideranging increased memory lucid dreaming astral projection increased levels of creativity body healing enhancing motor skills improved reaction time heightened vigor tapping into your subconscious mind curing insomnia stress relief telepathy reduces blood pressure increases athletic performance increases bloodflow to the brain and precognition. Youll notice many of those relate to stress which we know can be controlled by the individual experiencing it and some are complete and total bullshit like astral projection precognition and telepathy. Many still are selfreported effects like pain relief or better memory or enhanced creativity which when actually measured under controlled conditions appear as they would normally.A page where the question was asked one bullshit answer given and one actual answer given. Hilariously the right answer is much shorter.Wrapping it up almost done.In conclusion the efficacy of binaural beats is entirely dependent on the observer. The things it seems to help with are almost always new age crap or the exact things youd expect a placebo effect to cause.And finally a WebMD article on the placebo effect. Youll notice such things that can be effected by it include but are not limited to depression pain irritable bowel syndrome and menopause. You also may notice directly under that part they mention a study on asthma where a placebo was used. While participants reported an improvement they did not do any better on breathing tests.There it all is!

5766976,0,t1_cxban4r,Different baking temperatures causes different chemical reactions to occur.  Let me focus on caramelization of sucrose common table sugar.  At  degrees Celsius  degrees Fahrenheit the sucrose molecule will start to break apart.  As the process proceeds hundreds of new and different compounds form giving sour and bitter flavors and browning occurs.  The sweetness goes down while the darker and more bitter the food gets. This is why sometimes I bake my cookies at a lower temperature to prevent caramelization and sometimes I bake them at a higher temperature.  It depends on the final flavor I am trying to create. Someone already mentioned the Maillard Reaction in comments above and did a nice job explaining it.  This is one of my favorite chemical reactions and many of my students have done research on the Maillard reaction in regard to its effect on flavor and nutrition.

These birds breed very easily in captivity and are very common to the point that a wild caught individual would cost more and be less desirable of a pet. Deforestation probably accounts for  of the the decline due to the adaptability of this species. This is not a species that only eats one kind of rare nut or only nest in one kind of tree they range from dense forest to savannahs. I would say the biggest reason for the birds decline would be from hunting and pollution. People could shoot down a number of these birds for their meat and feathers and these birds are probably killed off in large numbers by different pesticides.,science,cxcczwx,6,t5_mouw

5814418,0,t3_3usm8q,I have only skimmed through the article due to time constraints but these are some thoughts about the main arguments. Also I should say that my research interest and grade dissertation are about a couple of late Pleistocene sites in the southcentral Andes. This might also explain any language shortcomings Ill do my best.I think the researcher has certainly acknowledged a very relevant aspect of social dynamics and while it is something that archaelogically we cannot trace we dont get any material evidence about moral disputes and distrust it is important to consider this because were dealing with people and not mere arrowheads and bones.However she seems to put too much emphasis on this emotional phenomena as the reason for dispersal which IMO is misrepresenting its place on the explanatory model we need. I think it is insufficient as a motive because morality is a social agreement and its terms change greatly over time and space as does the set of laws that rule the collective process of solving any conflicts. Surely groups sometimes break up and divide because of a number of disputes but most of the time you can only solve issues in the ways that your societal and cultural context allows it. This means that you can only choose those paths that are considered possible and this varies greatly among different social contexts.A good example could be this in the case that my girlfriend would cheat on me with my best friend what could be my reaction? Me being a chilean young guy from a welloff family with a college education leftist views judeochristian morality and so on probably I would choose nonviolent ways of dealing with it confronting them public shaming throwing a fit etc.. But there are plenty of other social contexts even in my own city where killing them would be a perfectly possible course of action. Obviously that wouldnt even occur to me. So universalizing these things as the author does is problematic as it naturalizes one of the most variable things across human societies morality.This gets even more problematic when doing it to one of the most complex processes of our history as is the dispersal all over the globe. I think that the idea she presents should be considered as one of the mechanisms for group breaking and dispersal since it is obviously that any other reason such as population density resource scarcity or whatever which I also acknowledge as problematic does not explain it in human terms. In other words that there might be subjacent reasons or motives for the rapid dispersal Im partial to high birth rates among early HG as a part of it but these thing have to work under concrete interpersonal relations and thus breaking up and moving afar might be an acceptable course of action given certain forms of conflicts which may vary and not only have to do with distrust but still.Even the author mentions when talking about the Baka of Cameroon that while emotions around conflicts provide the most energy to movements the main reason for young men to travel is to learn innovative craft skills in the hope of proving their worth and being more desirable to women. So as we say in my country lets not put the cart ahead of the oxen.,science,cxhtzh4,32,t5_mouw

When I went over the genetics of cancer for my course the hallmarks were brought up in lectures.It sums up what cancer is essentially and thus the problems faced when trying to deal with it. Here is an image for a more user friendly take Self sufficiency in growth signals  insensitivity to anti growth signals  tissue invasion and metastasis spreading  limitless replicative potential  sustained angiogenesis angiogenesis  keeping blood supply to feed the cancers growth  evading apoptosis apoptosis  programmed cell death a normal cell with screwed up genes will often kill itself to prevent it becoming a cancerous cellThe reason you hear about so many supposed cures is because often enough its news articles ill equipped and with poor understanding trying to make sense of a labs work who in no way want to downplay their findings more grant money more research more influence more name recognition etc. These guys havent even done clinical research it could be found that RAS the growth protein being switched off is far more important a couple years down the track in making sure your bone growth and regeneration isnt inhibited or something. Youll often find most cancer research is an attempt to disrupt one of these hallmarks of cancer. For example if you prevent a malignant cells attempt to evade apoptosis the screwed up cell will shrivel up die and likely just get vacuumed up and fed to a macrophage. If you break the ability for sustained angiogenesis the tumours size is greatly limited to the blood vessels surrounding it if it cant metastasis its contained and wont spread etc. And youll also find not all solutions fix the problem neatly or sufficiently.In a way we have cured cancer via chemotherapyanti cancer drugs The life expectancy for those with cancer have increased across the board consistently every decade as we do find more and more ways to inhibit cancer growth and thus slowly edge out the mortality that cancer represents. But there isnt some catch all magic drug you can take and live forever and the side effects are by no means pleasant purposely breaking down vital proteins because the horrific side effects are better than death is possibly where this study is looking at.

Easiest way is likely to reach out to people directly involved and see what they need or offer to financially help money talks. This can be quite difficult however given  red tape that may not be avoidable. Also keep in mind universities and  public institutions come with an extra player who understandably take the majority percent in patents usually.Today a lot of larger corporations and investment groups have a ridiculous amount of capital to throw at any profitable technology. So how can a small private investor get involved? I cant speak for the biotech industry so much as the chemical industry but usually requires either getting financially involved in the preliminary stages or waiting for the company to go public. The chemical industry has less demand for specialized companies which leads towards wanting less outside investment due to thinner margins higher competition. R amp D is still desired but the costs have curtailed demand chemical industry.What i will say generally is the biotech industry takes a more favorable approach towards private investors by forming publicly traded companies before being bought out. That favors smaller investors getting involved prior to a market ready technology being offered.,science,cxltyj9,12,t5_mouw

It might be passed on it might not.  When sex cells combine and begin to divide the idea of the cell simply doubling its DNA and splitting is a very simplified view.  For example look at this   This is one of the largest obstacles that faces the transfer of epigentic changes.  So in some cases the epigentic change gets reversed in the offspring but in other cases imprinted genes that changes can stay.  The next question is Do these changes have any effect on the offspring?  So for example here are the children fatter? do they get diabetes heart failure grow a third eye all die from cancer?  Or in most cases the changes does nothing.  Even if the change does get passed on what happens after that is anyones guess.  The field is still very new we have started to link some genes and epigenetics changes to actual measurable differences in offspring but we are still years away from a understanding well enough to use it in any marketable applications.,science,cxmivab,1,t5_mouw

The reduction of variety of crops thus is not a result of anything bad  it is a result of a good thing farmers wanting to maximize their returns.The idea that this is somehow bad is rooted in ignorance and superstition.We create new strains all the time and old ones go away. It is how farming has always worked. If you can farm better than other people why wouldnt your neighbors adopt your better methods techniques and crops? Indeed this is how all technology works.gt Mesoamericans didnt use monocultures they used the three sisters system where corn squash and bean were planted together.Depends on where youre talking about.

I find Level  to be the hardestbest workoutIf youre open to giving things a try perhaps if you have a spell where youd rather work out at home give Jillian Michaels  day shred a try. Its free on youtube. You need  lb handweights amp a mat if youre on a hard or gritty surface. Its a fantastic HIIT workout you can easily adjust things to suit your needs amp it takes  minutes. It gets me muscle definition amp builds my enduranceenergy quick.I adjust moves for my fitness level for injuries amp for my preferences.  If Im exhausted or out of shape sometimes my form goes to shit on things like squats or lunges if I try to do them too quickly. So Ill follow along but go a bit slower than the video maybe add a brief pause on the most painful part so its still hard enough.  My knees hurt if I land a jumping jack w my feet out to the sides so I land em w my feet under me like Im jumping rope. Same reason I dont do skaters jumps that land sideways on  leg so I sub another hard cardio move like Burpees. I have very high arches amp backwards lunges make them hurt so I just do forward lunges.  I hate pushups so I sub doing anything else in plank personal fave  plank w a  lb weight in each hand raise  limb at a time. For the same reason I drop the pushup from Burpees amp just jump out into plank position for that part of it. Its still plenty hard. Easy changes to make.Ive been doing this workout for years. It makes a big difference in my appearance real quick every time I go back to it. Even when I dont reign in my calories enough to see much of a weight loss this workout still makes very noticeable changes in my appearance energy level amp mood.

Cochrane systematic review evidencebased dentistry has shown that composites fall out much sooner when it is placed without a dental dam perfect isolation. Adhesive efficiency goes down by huge margin. On average Cochrane states that composites last  years with proper isolation whereas without a dental dam or improper adhesion technique such as avoiding the threestep technique and going for a simpler autoetch allinone technique it has been found the filling fails because of secondary caries through marginal infiltration within a couple years average  years.  of the time it isnt on the patients habits but actually the lack of proper isolation during fillings especially for composites. This isnt the case for amalgam one of amalgams advantages is the fact that it is still very efficient when proper isolation cannot be obtained and glass ionomers for root caries.

Its super profitable to sell prescription opioid drugs and heroin on the street because law enforcement is always cracking down on it and driving up the price. The penalties for dealing heroin are insane you almost certainly go to prison for  years if you get caught if not more. Its clearly not working there is to much money in it due to prohibition.What we could do is allow hardcore addicts to obtain opiates legally through state run clinics the same way we allow them to obtain methadone and buprenorphine under our current system only in this scenario we give them what they want instead of a substitute. All the biggest customers all the hardcore addicts would flock to these programs which would more than pay for themselves btw and the price of prescription opiates and heroin would go down. Suddenly a life sentence for dealing with something that isnt very profitable doesnt sound like such a good deal. People quit selling it because they cant make any money at it they start doing other things for money. Now suddenly we see that high school kids no longer have access to this crap. Congratulations we just ended the prescription drug and heroin epidemic in America hallelujah! ,science,cy82xzp,10,t5_mouw

6037189,0,t1_cyaxtr6,Its kind of an odd term in this use not that its wrong because it sounds similar to purebred a term used to describe animals artificially cultivated by humans with limited genetic diversity. Bison were a complete naturally occurring species with plenty of intraspecies genetic diversity so theyre like any naturally occurring species and despite the pure terminology here bison are very different from artificially cultivated purebreds. Cattle were bovine specifically bread for certain traits limiting their genetic diversity. So saying these bison are pure without cattle genetic influence is like having a group of wolves without say poodle genetic influence. The wolves are doing just fine on their own from a genetics standpoint. Might there be some diseases that bison are more susceptible to than modern cattle? Definitely. However overall modern cattle species are likely to have less genetic diversity with greater risk of autosomal recessive disease than bison and introducing their genetic material to bison may overall increase disease among bison. ,science,cyazljz,12,t5_mouw

Still the brain itself in an average man today isnt that much different from a man  years ago. The difference is that you are a product of generations of men who have developed ways to remake their environment in ways that made survival easier and passed that information on among each other and to their descendantssuccessors who then worked on the ideas they inherited improving on it and even developing new ones of their own.

I can believe that it is more difficult through the lense of your TBI but I encourage you not to fall into the trap of thinking the VA is attempting to discount your TBI. I think if you went over your records which you can request at will and receive digital copies of for all VA treatment within  hours of said appointment through My HealtheVet you would find that this is more due to the diagnostic overlap of TBI residuals and comorbid PTSD and that the physician who evaluated you using the screening tool for TBI most likely determined your subjective complaints in light of objective examination more likely resulted from your PTSD. It absolutely is hard to come to grips with someone else who doesnt suffer from your disability judging the severity of the disability especially in terms of compensability but I think you are really not doing justice to the VA medical personnel providing your care by claiming that they are treating you with throwaway medicine. Im sure they within the guidelines provided by the VAs administration are providing you the best care that they can with the tools they have.

However if our goal is to make it completely legal we have to be reasonable and spread correct info. Nothing works for everyone and thats ok. Benzodiazapines are the number one drugs prescribed for people with anxiety disorders. Marijuana works better for me than any Benzo including the Xanax my Dr saw fit to shove down my throat. However for some people Xanax is a life saver and Marijuana doesnt  really help their anxiety. That doesnt make Medical Marijuana any less important. Its about helping those of us who it does work wonders for. For everyone else hopefully they can find what their body needs. Its the same way with everything. Tylenol doesnt work for my fianc but ibuprofen works wonders for her. For me the issue is about compassion. Compassion isnt exclusive to medical Marijuana. For this guy compassion is about the drugs he needs to have the best quality of life possible. For him opiates are his only hope.

6132590,0,t3_3zjy4e,Hi! I have a bunch of questions if you dont mind!. SpaceXs Falcon  rocket whichll carry Jason to orbit on the th was grounded for six months after a launch failure in June. In addition prior to the rockets grounding the launch date had slipped from March to August of last year due to F certification issues. Overall Jason is launching  months later than originally planned. How did this delay impact a the satellite construction amp integration process b overall spacecraft costs and c the missions scientific goals?. What is the precise mass of Jason to the nearest kg preferably? Some sources have it at kg others at kg others at kg? Itd be great if you could specify dry vs. wet mass.. Are you able to disclose the target injection orbit? Although CNES describes a  km  operational orbit is the injection orbit that the rocket delivers the spacecraft directly into the same? Or does the spacecraft itself do any of the insertion work using onboard propellant?. How much commonality is there between the three Jason spacecraft? Externally they appear very similar since theyre all based off the same bus Jason   but how are the instruments and other systems different?,science,cympm64,163,t5_mouw

6135698,0,t1_cympr82,Interesting question Bhagzogzy. You are correct that only a few percent of the ocean has been mapped the conventional way by ships and most of what we know about the topography and geology of the ocean floor has been inferred from satellite altimetry. Our research along these lines is outlined hereThe Google Earth overlays that my colleague Dave Sandwell made are really cool and I thank Slalomstyle for linking to them. Jason will not at least initially add much to ocean floor mapping because it will refly the same orbital ground track previously surveyed by TOPEX Jason and Jason. This is a deliberate feature to allow us to monitor changes in sea level over years and decades. We dont expect to get new information on the ocean floor under these tracks from Jason. But after Jason has been calibrated to Jason then we can move Jason to a new orbit. If there is reason to believe at some point in the future that the orbiteers will no longer be able to maintain Jasons orbit then it will be moved out of the way of Jason to avoid a crash that would produce space junk. The outoftheway orbit may bring Jason over new points on Earth we havent seen before. The gaps left by previous orbital coverage are large enough for unknown seamounts to hide in so eventually an endoflife mapping mission by Jason may show us new seamounts.And farther in the future after JasonCSSentinel has been launched and intercalibrated to Jason we may be able to move Jason to an endoflife mapping orbit. So in the long run after Jason has done its primary job of monitoring ocean dynamics and climate we may be able to use it for more bathymetry from space.WHFSmith,science,cyn2bqh,19,t5_mouw

I have played football since I was in rd grade currently play at the college level and have never had a diagnosed concussion. Sure I have had minor headaches and such after hits but that also happens when you head the ball in soccer or are hit in the head with a basketball.People need to understand what is happening and know that if you have a bad concussion like cant go to class or are hurt by the light or sound that maybe you should hang it up. I have always said if I get a bad concussion it would be hard to continue to play football. But with proper tackling that was big for me never use your head you can play football without concussions. The NFL needs to invest in working to change the way kids tackle and hit or else this will just become a bigger problem.

Somewhere to get bulk bought items home. If you have a car great. If not keep in mind that in a lot of places that means either walking and carrying all of your groceries at once and managing any kids you have in tow at the same time or riding the bus which means not only carrying all the groceries to and from the bus stop along with toddlerherding and babytending but also probably bag limits. Our bus service limits you to bags you can hold in your lap  youre not allowed to put them down on the floor both for safety reasons and to discourage the homeless from ridesitting. So if youre carrying a diaper bag or even a large purse that leaves you with room for basically one or two small grocery bags if you have a big lap. Realistically its whatever you can fit into a backpack and still carry. And thats assuming your lap isnt already occupied by a baby.. The means to safely and hygienically store bulk grocery items and the subsequent bulkcooked food. In lowincome housing rats mice and roaches are endemic making longterm or even reasonably short term storage of many foods untenable. And this is true even if you keep your own place spotless since theres nothing you can do about the neighbors who share wallsfloorsceilings with you. Even if pests are not a problem storage space in. Most lowincome apts and public housing dont have pantries or a lot of cabinet space and maybe one or two small closets for everyones clothes and other belongings. A lowincome family living in public housing with a few kids basically doesnt have enough space to store even a reasonable assortment of household items like pots and pans dishes shoes clothes and other items let alone storing bulk food out of the reach of kids pets and pests.  Plus fridges in lowincome places are often the bare minimum size to hold a weeks worth of food if that many small apts come with those little dorm fridges or ones not much bigger than that. And of course this is assuming you even have your own place and arent living in a shelter or just renting a room in someone elses house. If thats the case all bets are off. Youve barely got room for your family and less than the basic necessities let alone food or cooking utensils.. The appliances necessary to prepare such food and to prepare it in more than minimal quantities. Its not unusual for lowincome housing to have substantial issues with kitchen appliances and storageprep space. Had this discussion with some friends a while back and it was just horror story after horror story about living in places with stoves that were shorted out and a fire hazard to use not even to mention the gas options...shudder shoddy electrical wiring that you didnt trust to leave a crockpot hooked up to overnight ovens that never worked not enough counter space to even set a crock pot out let alone store one not enough storage for even basic small pots and pans etc. Heck I know one family who makes pretty decent money lower middle class easily and who has three teenage sons to feed who went an entire year with a nonoperative oven because the landlord kept putting them off about getting it fixed. And they were in no way shape or form living in lowincome housing. The reality is a lot of landlords suck a lot of lowincome housing is substandard and maintenance underfunded on a good day and that means that a lot of poor people are stuck with dodgy cooking options like a microwave and one working burner if they have any options at all see renting a room or living in a shelter above.. The time and energy to cook said food from scratch. Which if youre balancing two or more jobs and kids on top of the other stresses lack of resources and timeconsuming realities that poverty entails chronic illness and pain long public transpo ridetimes massive timeeating errands because you have to walk everywhere dont have internet to pay bills online etc just isnt happening. Its all well and good to say it just takes this and that and a bit of the other. The reality is for a lot of people two out of those three just arent there. Exhaustion both physical and mental compounded with lack of resources like cooking experiencetraining time constraints lack of someone to handle the kids while you do everything necessary to make it happen like chopping veg and stirring the pot that can be dangerous for small kids to interfere with and having adequate space to do bulk food prep before and storage of the food after on top of insufficient cooking options basically means that cooking from scratch in bulk andor from bulk staples is something that actually takes a minimum level of privilege a little more free time more sleep a second pair of hands or a dedicated housewifehusband a bit more money a car a pantry etc to manage. Ive both lived in poverty and worked with povertyfocused organizations and Ive seen and lived these realities firsthand. Its easy to say something is easy or just takes a little work. But the truth is saying that means you have or had a level of quite likely unseen and unrecognized privilege that a lot of people dont like access to a vehicle a decent grocery store a kitchen and safe storage options for the food you bought.,science,cytkomt,2,t5_mouw

All I meant was that their ethical guidelines that their common sense and Intelligence are not something that popped into their head naturally. They were thought it by some source or another be it ancient books or a slow forming from society in general. Common sense morals do not exist. That is why cultures can vary so widely on what is moral or not. If you raise a group of kids completely isolated from the rest of the population their sense of right and wrong may vary widely from the fairly standard sense of right and wrong experienced in the U.S. My point was not that the book are correct and the teachers are not. My point was that our standards for right and wrong are not intrinsic they are learned from an outside source. To claim that your teacher has the real true standard of right and wrong is stupid because there is no more objective measure to base it against. It will always vary by society and individual. There are no fundamental ethical truths. There are ones that are heavily pushed by groups of people such as those who practice medicine but that is just because that foundation has been decided by their society.

I say somewhat because although there are many comets with similar orbits these orbits arent what most people would think of if asked to explain what a comet is.The prototypical comet orbit most people would think of first is a very elliptical orbit that comes zooming in from way out past Neptune. P however never gets closer to the Sun than Earth and never gets much farther away from the Sun than Jupiter.Thats unfortunate in a way because wed like to know what those comets are like but we dont have the capability of matching an orbit like that. It would take a lot of rocket to do that and because solar panels all but give up once you get past Jupiters orbit that means you have to haul a heavy radioactive battery or enormous solar panels which means even more rocket. Rosetta had to go into a low power hibernation mode to survive the trip to Ps orbit.Fortunately Ps orbit is new. Jupiter stole a good chunk of its energy in a close encounter in  putting a comet that we would have had no chance of reaching right at the edge of what we can. Before the Jupiter encounter it wasnt a way out past Neptune sort of comet but still. A few decades is almost nothing on astronomical time scales so P is as good as close as were going to get to one of those prototypical comets for now.,science,cyy32jc,17,t5_mouw

If you mean that he trusts his workexpertise on his own research and has critical doubts about other researchers in his field than I say great thats how peer review is supposed to work. But I think you meant that he trusts everyone in his field but has doubts about other fields of research. When I present research to a peer reviewed panel at  academic conferences my team is up all night trying to anticipate how we are going to be critically attacked academically. That was and is a good thing for science it keeps everybody on their toes. The double blind research model was designed to fight bias. Bias is a big problem in science and its the reason the very idea of state sponsored science is a real problem for me. Politics and religion should have no place in science. The integrity of all science has been called into question by the actions of a few in your field and I dont like it. Creating results to fit any agenda should be a criminal offense. It used to be publish or perish and there was tenure to be sure you could say what you wanted without interference. Now it seems like its publish but go along to get along or perish Any field that is quoted by the president as being . in agreement is suspect and should be treated as such by any critical scientist in any field. Instead any critique is met with derision and name calling from the fan base. Somebody even tracked down the Italian scientist that published a badthe . paper to find out what was wrong with him. Hard science to use your term means theory based science. I was actually being snarkier than you thought what I meant by divining was do you have a theoretical prediction youre testing of course the answer is no. In the s Columbia University had control of the Biosphere in Oracle AZ they did several research projects and left with a summary of the time there with a recommendation that CO and atmospheric studies be conducted in the future. Here is a chance for a bright young scientist like yourself to make a name for yourself by conducting experimental scientific research in a controlled environment. Just like hard sciences you just might build the results into a Grand Unified Theory of the Environment. Just like Einsteins General Theory of Relativity or that last theory that he died working on I think he called the Grand Unification Theory also known as the theory of everything.

I.e. one of the following must be true There is no other intelligent life in the galaxy.  Numerically this seems unlikely though it is believable if we consider possible selfdestructive tendencies of an advanced civilizations. There are advanced civilizations that are able to colonize the galaxy but not willing to or at least not willing to interact with Earth.  This is the solution you propose.

6297203,0,t1_cz5ctgs,Nick Normal cells make ROS during cell division with the highest levels derived from superoxide generated during mitosis. But ROS generated during the cycle is highly regulated in time and space and normal cells have a significant antioxidant reserve capacity.  In contrast cancer cells constitutively produce high levels of ROS. To tolerate this cancer cells rewire their redox signaling circuits including upregulation of the expression of some but not all antioxidant enzymes. Enhancing ROS production during a normal cell cycle causes cell cycle arrest activation of stress responses or apoptosis.  Cancer cells generally lack the appropriate checkpoints and stress responses or have corrupted them to their advantage and they dont care about DNA damage. It is one of these adaptive survival response we are trying to target.,science,cz5f5kw,1,t5_mouw

6315514,0,t1_cz6sa9m,gt      gt gt gt gt If current trends of greenhouse gas emissions continue th current long term trend will continue. Would that be accurate?IANA scientist but my understanding is that even if we cut all emissions tomorrow the warming trend would not stop immediately. It would continue on virtually unchanged for a while before even slowing down and its going to take an even longer time for things to start cooling again.The main reason for this is that heating up an entire planet takes a lot of time and therefore the global temperatures we measure right now do not fully reflect the effect of the amount of greenhouse gasses that currently already are in the atmosphere. Think about when you fill up a hotwater bag the outside surface doesnt become hot immediately. In fact IIRC with our planet its the way water i.e. the oceans behaves when warmed up is the biggest cause of this temperature inertia which I know is different from the hotbag scenario because the water is already hot but... anyway. If you ever travelled between somewhere on the coast of a big landmass and further inland in late spring or autumn youll have experienced this. The coastal regions warm up slower in spring and stay warm longer into autumn because water reacts more slowly to changes in temperature than land does and thus the air temperatures differ. These are surface effects which can change noticeably within a few months. But the oceans are deep.tldr Our planet is currently still colder than it should be at levels of  ppm CO amp  ppb methane in the air. These arent fully priced in yet.also take this with a grain of salt  sorry if Ive typed any BS somewhereEDIT found a source Yup Earth is bound to heat up for a looong time regardless of when and how we finally come around and act.,science,cz7i5pn,2,t5_mouw

6349854,0,t1_czb7dkr,Thanks for the writeup.  This should be the top comment and I suspect it will be shortly.  I want to add a few points for perspective.  As the title suggests transdifferentiation has been proposed and worked on since Yamanakas breakthrough work around a decade ago.  Indeed many cell types have been directly created from a separate adult cell type without the need of a pluripotent intermediary  Also most of the work up until now has actually been trial and error.  Thus this paper and algorithm will serve as a very valuable tool for researchers.  With this said there are still some things to be considered for future regenerative medicine purposes.  For instance  there are still unknowns to this methodology as epigenetic memory of the cell type of origin may linger. This could potentially be problematic as certain epigenetic marks which help define a specific cell type may limit the true identity of the transdifferentiated cell type causing problems in terms of research on insert disease here.  in terms of regenerative medicine it is desirable to insert a transgene through nonintegrating methods as lentiviral genomic integration can be random and lead to activation of oncogenic factors which lead to cancer  Recently we have taken ways to avoid this either through smallmolecule directed differentiation strategies or through the use of nonintegrating episomal vectors which are eventually washed out through cellular proliferation   Some would also argue that proceeding through development as an embryo would is key to establishing true cellular identity.  When we culture human pluripotent cells in vitro they continue to follow through a normal human developmental timeline.  For instance when creating neurons from pluripotent cells multipoint neural progenitors are formed first followed by neurons and with longer time in culture yielding glial cells which is normal in human neurodevelopment  In order to get oligodendrocyte cell types we need to culture cells for over  days the same as when they begin to appear in a developing fetus.   The intrinsic age of the cell including factors such as DNA damage telomere shortening etc would be passed on to the transdifferentiated cell type.  This is potentially a good thing when modeling things such as neurodegenerative diseases which are agedependent.  Indeed a recent paper shows how transdifferentiation may be key in yielding more true agerelated phenotypes  This can also be a bad thing however as this could affect the overall quality of the cell type created and thus influence the cellular system that may be interesting to researchers.  The most important thing that is needed in this field is really to determine if transdifferentiated cells are identical to the adult cell type of interest.  A huge problem in stem cellderived cell types is that they are young aka immature.  Their transcriptomic profiles and phenotypes resemble that of a developing fetus for the reasons stated previously.  We need to find ways to age or mature cells into a cell that more truly resembles their adult counterparts.  One way to do this may be by expressing the gene involved in Progeria or a fastaging syndrome  I personally believe that transdifferentiation is part of the solution but also D culturing systems will be required.  We know that progenitor cell types can be transplanted into a mouse and mature into an adult cell type  This is likely due to the D micro signaling environment niche that the host animal provides for maturity.  Hopefully these algorithms will aid in speeding up research in these areas and incorporating D culture systems composed of multiple cell types. I realize this is scienceheavy so I can provide simpler answers if needed.,science,czbeov2,9,t5_mouw

You also dont see what the other person is doing most of the time thats why it doesnt work well with the algorithm used here.What players do is to scout using cheap units early in the game and once they see what the other player is building extrapolate from that based on a list of viable build orders currently in use. Then they alter their own build order based on their current situation and what they think could be a good counter. The other player does the same though.From an algorithmic point of view there are many more fields on the playing board than on a Go board so the decision tree is much broader in Star Craft. Unlike chess and Go you can also move all of your units at the same time.,science,czezlqy,4,t5_mouw

Bowling analogy the pins all go from the scattered to standing back up and the ball rolls back down the alley into the persons hand. Something to do with Tachyons? The other is effects being measured as if something happened despite it not happening till afterwards. Analogy The pins scattered and then ball rolls down the lane at them.Delayed choice? The last is the one I thought was interesting. Current measurements act like a certain event happened despite the presumed events at the time not being seen. Analogy The ball misses the pins and then a few moments later the pins are scattered as if the ball was a strike the entire time.

Our biggest contribution in my mind is that we took a lot of verbal arguments that people were making and we wrote them in a mathematical form and then solved the math and realized that there were some direct consequences of these assumptions that were not apparent in the original claims. So you can think of the model here as a really efficient way to perform logical deductions from a given set of claims. The really cool thing is that the equations our model uses are all relatively uncontroversial and minimalLotka Volterra has been around forever and the Henrich culture evolution equation has been tested over and over again.

6478172,0,t1_czos1l2,We have theorized that empathy evolved from our natural instinct for parental care. In every mammal species there is a mother that cares for the offspring during a period of time when they are quite vulnerable. That mother needs to be able to sense and respond to the physical and emotional needs of the offspring and the mothers that can do that best will have offspring that survive and thrive. A few mammals also have biparental care where the father also responds to the needs of the offspring. This is empathy in its most basic form. In at least some species that ability to sense the emotional needs of others and the motivation to respond to those needs has adapted to be directed toward other adults. This is how evolution generally works  through slight modifications in systems that are already present for another purpose. Being able to sense and respond to others in need particularly among highly social and cooperative animals that rely on each other for survival provides a selective advantage that allows empathetic traits to evolve. Empathy is our evolutionary heritage one we share with many animals and probably all mammals.,science,czpe23o,3,t5_mouw

6563174,0,t3_45ijke,Heres something I posted in the rtechnology story about this which probably should go here as wellCheck this out Editorial Essay Why Do We Still Have Journals?Administrative Science Quarterly June    Costs  to download the PDF but you can view it for free in scihub.The tldr is that paid journals are necessary to maintain high quality science. gt In this essay I argue that the core technology of journals is not their distribution but their review process. The organization of the review process reflects assumptions about what a contribution is and how it should be evaluated. Different review processes thereby create incentives for different kinds of work. gt At their best journals accomplish three things certifying convening and curating.gt Certifying is what the review process does validating articles as having made it through a vetting process however organized.gt Convening means that specific journals are able to bring together interested and engaged scholars in a way that the abstract endeavor of organizational scholarship cannot. The membership of the editorial board reflects a journals ability to attract the voluntary and mostly anonymous labor of outstanding scholars. Ideally scholars will regard a journal as a community but not a club.gt Curating suggests that what is published in a particular journal is likely to be worth reading. In a field in which  or more papers are published every year it is helpful to have the assurance that papers in a specific journal will be worth your time.gt Journals can also serve a civilizing function. Through their editorial practices journals can enhance the legibility of arguments and findings. Graduate programs rarely teach students how to write well and good scientists are not always good writers. Many of us believe that our Stata output ought to speak for itself and that the words surrounding the tables are mostly ornamental. Although many journals have dispensed with the close editing of articles entirely those that continue to do so serve a civilizing function by training new authors in how to write for an audience.gt The review process is what ASQs founding editor James D. Thompson would call a core technology for journals. Journals organize the review process in many different ways reflecting assumptions about what the journal is trying to accomplish and what qualifies a paper to be published. Here are a halfdozen possibilities that I have seen in various combinations at different journalsgt . Accuracy papers have a true intrinsic value the goal of the review process is to identify those whose value is above a particular thresholdgt . Impact the value of papers is uncertain ex ante the goal of the review process is to identify those likely to be highly citedgt . Development the value of papers is altered by the review process itself the goal of the review process is to identify promising papers and make them good enough to end up in printgt . Innovation papers exist to advance the state of the field through new methods new findings new insights new theory the goal of the review process is to distinguish the innovative from the mundane and the merely wronggt . Keeping score papers are markers of achievement in the academic careers of their authors the goal of the review process is to provide a reasonable judgment while minimizing the trauma to the author andgt . Community papers are convening devices for a community of scholars the goal of the review process is to inform and refine the taste and judgment of the participants in the scholarly enterprise. These are not mutually exclusive and different journals emphasize different combinations of values. It is fair to say that there isnt broad consensus in the field around which of these are the right values.,science,czy6qpi,11,t5_mouw

6568011,0,t1_czyitx9,Rail traffic control systems engineer here. This is correct. In my industry we address these concerns in two ways . Total physical network separation. Railroads often maintain their own communications backbone dedicated to traffic control and other critical services. To gain access a hacker needs to overcome physical security layers in addition to network security layers. Not impossible but pretty hard. . Distribution of vital functions. Any controls that come over the line to a device in the field are treated as requests. Field devices have embedded logic that will execute or not a control request depending on the state of the system. Controller wants to run two trains into eachother? You can request it all day but the logic in the field will prohibit an unsafe command from being executed.In the case of selfdriving cars physical security is probably not going to work out given wireless communications will be most likely be involved.

Some of those diets have actually been shown to reverse progression of plaques in arteries. However such a diet is extremely hard for most people to follow and often is a goal that not only cannot be achieved but is sometimes a discouragement to people in modifying their diet . For that reason I recommend that people moderate their animal fat intake and lower their calories to a level that they can tolerate in the long term.

Experiments show for example the fact that the expansion of the universe is accellerating that the cosmological constant is positive but very small. So we live in de Sitter but nearly flat.EDIT inflation has to do with some quantum field that rides down a potential until it finds it minimum.

The consequences of engaging in or not engaging in a transaction are not an externality.If there was a flouride factory that was leaching the right amount of flouride into the water that would be a positive externality.  If there was a toxic chemical factory that was leaching toxic chemicals into the water that would be a negative externality.An externality is something that is external to the transaction not a consequence of a transaction.gtBut more to the point are you seriously going to do an accounting of human suffering?Thats pretty much exactly what economists are paid to do.

Among other things theres a now famous video of a sea lion raping a penguin.There have been some interesting experiments done where primate enclosures have been redesigned to give the females the choice in intercourse and their behavior indicates that it is often indeed nonconsensual and can be categorized as rape.Regardless its how its referred to in the literature sort of like how the gorilla thing is categorized as singing despite some folks here on Reddit saying they disagree with that particular definition.Thats fine but if you disagree do some research and come up with a different term and convince others who study behavior to also adopt the new term.

For instance you can either keep the same materials and open up concerns that you have a different subject groupgt An original study that measured Americans attitudes toward African Americans  was replicated with Italians who do not share the same stereotypesOr you can change the materials to better suit the culture of your participants and open yourself up to claims that you are studying different phenomena.gt An original study that asked Israelis to imagine the consequences of military service  was replicated by asking Americans to imagine the consequences of a honeymoon If you want to make broad claims about how people function your results should be at least somewhat invariant to the subject group and materials.And by the way the military service vs. honeymoon sounds like an awful change to make the way that Gilbert et al put it but when you actually look at the materials its not that much of a difference people are being asked how betrayed they would feel if someone promised to take on a work project for them and dropped it if they had to leave for either military service Israel or a honeymoon US. That change was just incidental to the culture since there isnt mandatory military service in the US. You can view the original and replication materials here,science,d0q1ech,14,t5_mouw

We in public health can not at times subjectcase recruitment is a major issue and a limitation we accept and have to deal with.Also this isnt one study at this point its multiple imagine this particular paper published not in a vacuum but with other studies as well and this looks at a very particular aspect in a well defined case that in itself is rare at times. You are absolutely right that N doesnt prove anything but N here isnt trying prove anything its saying that given everything thats happened and all the research thus far this is also very much possible and heres a closer look at it.The Lancet study published by Wakefield read it when you get a chance was a godawful piece of work for a number of reasons none of which exists for this one. Likewise the paper doesnt even say theres a link just a possibility of one and to look at an outcome class that everyone isnt necessarily talking about stillbirths and spontaneous abortions. Microcephaly still results in live births so were systematically eliminating the  other birth outcomes which can be problematic.You would be surprised how little information is actually taken in by medical professionals namely because of how busy they are. Not every state has good health information flow.Lastly to go back to the type  and type  for real life problems here. Case definitions are the jump off point here right now everyone is looking at Zika linked to microcephaly and deservedly. However what if Zika can cause other birth defects outside of microcephaly as in what if Zika can cause these defects but no microcephaly? Then we would be underreporting our cases and the case definition might have to be expanded and future studies would have to reflect that. Now obviously we are not at that step but this information is important and when you think about it whats the best way to share information among researchers? Published peerreviewed papers. If we just falsely assume that Zika can only cause microcephaly then can run afoul later. Likewise if we falsely assume Zika can cause these issues theres no real harm here.,science,d0tu804,2,t5_mouw

6881271,0,t1_d0w8f2d,The simple answer is theres nothing like the Mormon Church.  Its amazing sociologically.  It really does seek to structure social life through not just rules but through creating norms.  Family Home Night is a great example.  You end up with cultural Mormons also called Jack Mormons in a way that you dont have cultural Episcopalians though you do get cultural Catholics and cultural Jews who maintain affiliations even if they no longer hold normative beliefs.  From the start of Utah history the Mormon church was dominantthe Boy Scouts most famously in many places theyre a de facto Mormon youth group but also for many other social institutions that are nominally secular.  It becomes selfperpetuating.Theres a really interesting article about how Vermont and New Hampshire started at similar places and end up quite different The reaccomplishment of place in twentieth century Vermont and New Hampshire history repeats itself until it doesnt.  People moving to Northern New England had a choice of where to go and Vermont became associated with one set of values and New Hampshire with another.  Theres a reason why Bernie Sanders was the mayor of Burlington Vermont and not Portsmouth New Hampshire.  Now New Hampshire of course is number two on the list so I dont meant to suggest that religious people moved to New Hampshire but that people select into environments and that this then creates feedback loops within those environments.  Vermont also had a range of social activities not associated with church.  The Grange movement of the th century was strong in northern New England. Im from a town in Massachusetts thats just white collar suburban now but until WWII was blue collar rural.  We still have a building that used to be the grange hall thats used for townorganized social events like lectures square dances etc.  There have traditionally been lots of other civic and municipal organizations that give people social outlets.  This is anecdotal but I have Mormon cousins in Southern California.  Most of them not only married young and were part of a Mormon institution for most of their lives many even went to BYU but even the ones who went to private schools were involved with the Mormon organizations there but thats often how they expect to meet their partners.  Many of them ended up going to a local Mormon church in Southern California that was known to be where all the singles went!  Mormonism structured their lives and when it structures your life its much easier to stay with it.  This has similarly been used to explain the revival of Orthodox Judaism.  Sociologists in the s all predicted it would die and that Conservative Judaism would fade away.  Conservative Judaism meanwhile has declined tremendously its no longer the largest Jewish denomination whereas the institution building of Orthodox Judaism day schools summer camps college Hillels and Chabads etc. etc. has led to low attrition and when you combine that with high birthrates which the Mormons also have means you have a movement far larger and more successful than sociologists of the s could have ever imagined.  In Vermont meanwhile churches arent and werent the same focus of social life.  I dated a nice Jewish girl from Vermont and it was interesting talking to her father who was a local school teacher.  He said that one of the big reasons that young people kept leaving was that besides there being relatively few high paying jobs it was very hard to meet other young people to date and marry.  There was no local singles church one could go to meet other young single people.  Instead besides moving people would do other things this was in  before internet dating had really taken off.  He was listening to this weird electronic music station and he explained this was quite popular in Vermont in part because they threw these big ravesparties in fields that gave young people a chance to meet each other romanticallike.So I think the hard part of sociology is that its often institutionalist pathdependence that matters rather than timeinsensitive demographic variables.  A lot of my favorite sociology ends up being sort of history with theory and comparison rather than regression analysis.  Thats of course how Darwin came up with his theory of evolution but its hard because its often not very falsifiable in the Popperian sense which means its hard to reject the inevitable mediocre work.,science,d0wb2rn,69,t5_mouw

6905091,0,t1_d0yne8n,gt Can you explain why nuclear energy is safer for the earth rather than oil energy?As was said no carbon emissions except for uranium extraction which is always going to be present even in solar or wind. Significantly larger energy product per unit volume so you need less nuclear for an equivalent amount of oil.Also heres the best thing More radiation is released by coal power plants than nuclear power planets. Quoth the abstract to McBride J. P. Moore R. E. Witherspoon J. P. amp Blanco R. E. . Radiological impact of airborne effluents of coal and nuclear plants. Science  . emphasis minegt Radiation doses from airborne effluents of model coalfired and nuclear power plants  megawatts electric are compared. Assuming a  percent ash release to the atmosphere Environmental Protection Agency regulation and  part per million of uranium and  parts per million of thorium in the coal approximately the U.S. average population doses from the coal plant are typically higher than those from pressurizedwater or boilingwater reactors that meet government regulations. Higher radionuclide contents and ash releases are common and would result in increased doses from the coal plant. The study does not assess the impact of nonradiological pollutants or the total radiological impacts of a coal versus a nuclear economy.The study is based on the assumption of the plant currently not trying to emulate Chernobyl or Fukushima. Which given the fact that the only plants that have had terrible accidents are old Fukushima and Chernobyl andor horrible Chernobyl designs is a pretty safe assumption to make.gt And what to do with nuclear waste so it wont affect our planet?If you dont want to recycle the highlevel waste like fuel rods which will vastly reduce the amount of waste and allow you to generate even more energy... the easiest and simplest solution to the radioactive waste problem Stick it in a deepass hole in the ground.No seriously thats the simplest and easiest solution.

It works similarly to HIV and HSV where it goes latent and then randomly pops up basically sitting around chilling in the body and having random outbreaks. Herpes is very similar which results in cold sores where it sits latent within the central nervous system and randomly manifests itself resulting in cold sores. This happens because it actually morphs itself into your DNA so when those cells multiply eventually it multiplies as well making it impossible to be detected by your immune system.Again similar to herpes though most people are assymptomatic meaning they may never show symptoms of it.

7042197,0,t1_d1ejr80,Im basing most of my assumption on Christianity and Islam being almost wholly tools of the state. As Rome began to collapse it became very convenient to have a doctrine to be happy in subjugation and the belief of redemption if you only stayed content in your current means and not rise up. Similar for the succession of caliphates through the Ottoman Empire only hardened from the Crusades having invaded their lands. Judaism originated as something closer to eastern religions like Taoism or Shinto where the obedience to God was kept through the observance of rituals that kept people safe despite the lack of scientific knowledge of why things had to be done a certain way.  I dont really know enough about eastern religion and its use in governance to really comment on it fully but given he way human nature works I wouldnt be surprised if it was in fact used in the same way. ,science,d1el98q,1,t5_mouw

7044544,0,t1_d1esfb0,Giving up on religion is not the same as giving up on finding a meaning for life or feeling connected to other people or the greater universe.  For me going through the existential crisis went from none of it matters to figuring out what did matter personally.   It was liberating to give myself permission to search for what makes me feel better about myself.  For me that meant figuring out how to be a better person who I like  without worrying about the opinion of the church or a god.  I could use my own criteria and trust my own feelings.  My feelings let me know when I am or am not meeting my own definition of what a good or valuable person is.  Maybe its a residual part of my religious training but I do find meaning and feel better when I do things that help others.  I also give myself permission to do things to take care of myself.Letting go of religion also made it easier to understand other people without the filter of the church getting in the way.,science,d1euup1,3,t5_mouw

One commentI agree that the effects are small and maybe even trivial. I couldnt find the exact numbers you cited when looking at the paper. The convention of describing effects of . as small is for Cohens d effect sizes. I think youre pointing out correlations in which case it would be .  small .  medium .  large. Same conclusion though. The authors report a Cohens d of . for low IQ and . for high IQ. Id argue that the . would be interpreted as small nontrivial. Of course they didnt report the confidence intervals so tough to say. So contrary to the headline that smart people are happier in urban settings the results seem to say that people in urban settings are less happy than people in rural settings regardless of IQ. Its just that the higher IQ group didnt drop as much but then again per Figure  it may be because the high IQ group wasnt as happy as the low IQ group in rural settings. ,science,d1k7nlr,4,t5_mouw

7095707,0,t1_d1kboat,gt Is the food production increasing or decreasing because of climate change? Margaret How climate change affects food production is very complicated. Sciencewise at any given agricultural location climate is changing in a particular way  maybe higher average annual temperature maybe higher winter temperatures maybe much drier or in some places wetter. And so farmers at any particular location need to change what theyre doing if they want to maximize their yields. In many cases it might be hard or expensive  for example increase irrigation in peak summer months. In others it might be easier or cheaper  for example use less fungicide because warmer and drier temperatures discourage certain plant diseases. Some farmers may look to more heattolerant cultivars of their crop. Others may switch crops entirely. Some areas that were not previously suitable for farming will become suitable. And likewise some areas that were good for farming may become marginal. I was talking a few weeks ago with a wine grape scientist who works in Europe. It was fascinating to look at whats been going on there in just the past few decades and with future forecasts. What seems apparent is that places in the south of Europe such as in Italy and some parts of France will become less and less usable for wine grapes. And portions of central and more northerly Europe are going to become better and better for wine grapes.Thats just the science. When you then look at the societal implications... well its hard and expensive to change. So if youre a farmer somewhere and you have to figure out how to change and what to change theres going to be some time in there that you lose some production. If you think about the established culture of wine grapes in Italy and France its going to be enormously painful for people to have to give up growing grapes that their families have grown for many generations. Likewise in newly useful agricultural areas many landowners may not realize that they can grow new crops and it may take a while for them to learn and adopt these crops. So in the shortterm there will almost certainly be a decrease.And Ive really only been talking about commodity crops. If you think about the large number of people who do sustenance agriculture food production will likely become more erratic due to increases in droughts and other anomalous events. So more famines I think unfortunately.,science,d1ko2a2,8,t5_mouw

News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at its important to understand the journal article.AbstractgtMoral judgments play a critical role in motivating and enforcing human cooperation and research on the proximate mechanisms of moral judgments highlights the importance of intuitive automatic processes in forming such judgments. Intuitive moral judgments often share characteristics with deontological theories in normative ethics which argue that certain acts such as killing are absolutely wrong regardless of their consequences. Why do moral intuitions typically follow deontological prescriptions as opposed to those of other ethical theories? Here we test a functional explanation for this phenomenon by investigating whether agents who express deontological moral judgments are more valued as social partners. Across  studies we show that people who make characteristically deontological judgments are preferred as social partners perceived as more moral and trustworthy and are trusted more in economic games. These findings provide empirical support for a partner choice account of moral intuitions whereby typically deontological judgments confer an adaptive function by increasing a persons likelihood of being chosen as a cooperation partner. Therefore deontological moral intuitions may represent an evolutionarily prescribed prior that was selected for through partner choice mechanism,science,d1uuare,2,t5_mouw

7196009,0,t1_d1w0udx,When I was in school for chemistry I TAd an orgo  class which was mostly made up of pre med students. And if we consider that class a case study most doctors arent all that keen on chemistry and arent very good at it. And then when you get into biochemistry theres just far too much there for anyone except a specialist to truly understand. Have you ever seen one of the sigma Aldrich published bio chemistry pathways posters? Its  feet tall and  feed wide and every inch is covered in  point font and lines intersecting all over the place. So add on top of that all the actual doctor stuff doctors have to learn after undergrad. They obviously have the ability to read white papers and study results of trials. Some but not all even dive into the methods and additional info sections and analyze for themselves whether its a slightly BS study or not. So when it comes to SSRIs theyll read studies showing that class of drugs usually at least work somewhat somehow. The only speculation to the mechanism is a chemical imbalance whatever that means since the effect of the drug is to stop seratonin reuptake effectively increasing concentration in the brain. This is rather equivalent to changing your oil by pouring  quarts over your whole engine block and noting that usually around  quarts actually makes it into the system. A lot of the time it makes the system as a whole sticky and sluggish after a while though and sometimes the whole car lights on fire.But this is both too complex and too cynical to tell a patient suffering from depression and there hasnt been many alternatives so they just pass on the chemical imbalance meme and it gets adopted into the cultural lexicon over time. Although theres been a lot more research on the subject recently. Supplementation of the seratonin precursor hydroxytryptamine seems to work for many people. One hour IV treatments with ketamine three times a week for two weeks seems to be showing excellent results so far  see extremely significant results IIRC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to work for many people as well although its hard to do a true double blind placebo study with this method since you can actually feel the magnetic strength. Granted the mechanism for both of those is also unknown. But theres at least alternatives to the SSRIs coming out now.,science,d1w4lbn,4,t5_mouw

Most analyses have been geographically or taxonomically restricted and the few quantitative global analyses have been limited by coarse temporal resolution or overly simplified climate reconstructions or proxies. gt We present a global analysis of the causes of these extinctions which uses highresolution climate reconstructions and explicitly investigates the sensitivity of our results to uncertainty in the palaeological record. gt Our results show that human colonisation was the dominant driver of megafaunal extinction across the world but that climatic factors were also important. We identify the geographic regions where future research is likely to have the most impact with our models reliably predicting extinctions across most of the world with the notable exception of mainland Asia where we fail to explain the apparently low rate of extinction found in in the fossil record. gt Our results are highly robust to uncertainties in the palaeological record and our main conclusions are unlikely to change qualitatively following minor improvements or changes in the dates of extinctions and human colonisation.,science,d1x4pw6,2,t5_mouw

It isnt a decision being made individually by millions of people who each can devote maybe a few hours to the problem.While the system isnt as efficient as it could be although anyone who tells you that all administrative overheads are unnecessary is deluded just as much as anyone who says that the current system is perfect there is certainly benefit to having a defined group of people making decisions if only because it makes it easy to figure out whos responsible.,science,d2076fy,2,t5_mouw

7273917,0,t1_d24y52a,Most cancerous cells arent able to undergo sustained proliferation in any tissue environment. The process of metastasis requires several complex changes to cellular functions its not as simple as cells just leaving the primary tumor and embedding elsewhere. A solid tumor is essentially an organ that includes not only the cancerous cells but also activated stromal cells immune cells and blood vessels so a metastasizing cancer must recruit or create these elements to grow. I think the article is imprecise in its description of these tumors in this sense. The fibrous capsule isnt the only thing preventing metastasis in this type of cancer the cells themselves have not acquired the ability to grow outside of the primary tumor.If a cancer is not prone to metastasis in the first place a biopsy doesnt carry much risk. Usually this isnt really known beforehand its probably one of the most important reasons why youd want to do a biopsy so there are biopsy techniques that minimize the risk of seeding cancer stem cells in the needle track and circulatory system. For example a coaxial method can be used where a larger outer needle is advanced just to the edge of the tumor then a smaller inner needle inserted into the tumor for biopsy.In the case of thyroid neoplasms this is probably overkill. As someone else already pointed out its a very superficial organ so a direct fine needle biopsy is fairly easy to do.,science,d24zuvb,68,t5_mouw

7284709,0,t1_d267izx,So before becoming aware if this article I would have thought the same. Us humans are creatures of habit and the most effective strategies for breaking bad habits is replacing them with new better habits and then getting used to the new situation.In the study a cohort of obese individuals are studied during a year of weight loss followed by weight maintenance. Right after weight loss hormone levels indicate a calorydeprived state. According to our default hypothesis this is where the cohort should start adapting to the new situation and maintain their weight loss by not adjusting the newly ingrained habits.In the study it is observed that after a year of maintaining the new weight most hormone levels have recovered to how they were before weight loss. It seems likely that weight was lost and subsequently maintained through the making of new better habits. I see no evidence against this. Nevertheless it cannot be denied that the having adjusted of hormone levels themselves will become very helpful in maintaining the new weight after the first year.Edit Better writing,science,d2680x0,2,t5_mouw

However they must make policy.Because the actual science requires several years of study to understand consensus among those who have done that study is the best surrogate for having done the analysis oneself.  gtNow my question was about why youre trying to convince us using consensus instead of with the science itself.If the policy discussion can only legitimately happen in light of climate science evidence then it cannot happen because the policymakers simply are not equipped for discussion at that level and neither are the people they represent.Secondarily  lack of consensus has been a buzzword used by climate change denialists in order to cause a delay in action of any kind so its normal to expect some papers to inspect and in this case debunk that claim.  Specifically here  and here TLDR Consensus is how confidence in argumentvalidity is communicated between the scientific research community and nonscientific policy community. Public perception is that without consensus action should not be taken.  Groups have publicized a myth that there is no consensus in order to stall action.,science,d26tm7l,9,t5_mouw

7322871,0,t1_d2a7fry,Hi!  This is Amy Sturm LGC past NSGC board of directors member and the NSGC Cardiovascular Genetics Expert.  Youre right genetic screening is not part of a standard health checkup at this time for complex diseases like hypertension.  This includes other common complex diseases like coronary artery disease diabetes and many cancers too.  By complex we mean that they are multifactorial in nature and there are many risk factors including environmental exposures smoking poor diet as well as genetic factors!  Many genes and variants have been discovered in research that contribute to these types of diseases.  The current issue is does adding this type of testing  Add to the specific risk assessment for a patient? and  Help to motivate healthy behavior changes?  Ongoing research will help us answer both of these questions and if one or both answers are YES then I think in the future we may well indeed see genetic testing for common complex diseases as part of the screening process.  It is also important to know that there are specific hereditary types of high cholesterol and cancer.  There is a common condition called Familial Hypercholesterolemia.  Ive written an NSGC blog about it which can be found here   Ive also written a blog about red flags that may indicate you have another type of hereditary heart disease   And I think shrimp alfredo  in moderation  might be okay!,science,d2ak6cx,1,t5_mouw

The good news is that if you do WGS you need to do it once or twice at the most. The barrier at the moment is reimbursement. Once Medicare starts reimbursing the test the other insurers will follow suit.Single agent therapy will always produce resistance unless the target is a universally used protein by all cell in the tumor and with such addiction that the cells cannot survive without it. That is not a common occurrence and thus we need to understand the heterogenous nature of the tumor to decide what combination of inhibitors and even standard chemotherapy to use.

If there was a second light that flashed at the same time twice as far away you would see that one after about  minutes.The key point about the cosmic background radiation is that it comes from a time about . billion years ago when the entire universe was glowing. So what we really see with our telescopes is light from a part of the universe that is so far away that the light it emitted . billion years ago is only just now reaching us.The light from that time from all the closer parts of the universe has already gone by.

We put the same mechanism outside the box. Then the box is closed. When the box is opened later automatically what will happen? Either  is alive and  dead  is dead and  alive both dead or both alive. Now say the system of  and  was in a box with physicist  on the outside. What happens when he opens the box? Well for him inside the box is  of  possibilities so all possibilities are in a superposition. The two original superpositions have become  greater superposition. If we put   and  in a box with  on the outside the same occurs and so on. Thus I concluded that when two superpositions interact they must merge into a more complex superposition. The only problem I have with it is that I dont know what I am in the grand scheme of things am I just a possible outcome of a superposition? ,science,d2fuw90,1,t5_mouw

I wonder if anyone has looked at what the most popular methods of partaking in a place like Colorado especially before and after legalization.  Dabs in particular seem like they might end up being pretty popular because you can basically shrink it down to an ecig like form factor.  The only thing really holding that back is how expensive and hard to get dabs are on the black market and that device markers cant easily advertise or reach a market that has consistent access to dabs.

It does have its problems and there are obvious covariates that are incredibly hard to control for namely other drug use and other black market activity that effect this study.  You just cant get around that no matter how careful you are especially when the substances in question and the potentially nasty covariates are illegal.The study is interesting.  It might be compelling enough to advise women not to smoke during pregnancy as a simple precaution.  To really at the truth though you either need a compelling pathway explaining how marijuana is doing what it is doing to pregnant women or have a population of smokers where you have a little more confidence that you are controlling for the blindingly obvious covariates associated with black market drug usage.,science,d2hf231,-2,t5_mouw

7394394,0,t1_d2hygla, Stop the behaviour take their attention away from the behaviour and put it on you telling them to stop. Use the Parent Voice possibly even the Death Glare if required. Deescalate. Most cases of misbehaviour are down to an uncontrolled escalation of emotion.  Focus on disrupting the selftalk loop thats keeping them agitated.  Make them put the issue on hold until they can calm down.   Refuse to engage with the topic until this happens.  Interrupt if they try to go round the loop again. Once the situation is under control  Praise them and switch to a nicer friendlier tone for calming down.  Extract an agreement that the blowup and the behaviour was unacceptable  Extract an agreement to try to avoid both in future.   If old   Make clear that they coped with the emotion badly and that this needs work.   Teach better ways to manage the anger  frustration  disappointment  etc that caused the problem. Offer comfort and affection be nice to them and let the matter drop. You never get personal you never get nasty or mean you never ever ever shame or humiliate. You never do anything that could be seen as revenge and you always always give them a route out of trouble  a specific behaviour that will immediately improve their situation. Herd them to somewhere dont just back them into a corner. I dont punish at all. I dont hit i dont confiscate or ground I dont revoke privileges I dont impose consequences if you have to deliberately impose it its not a consequence its revenge. And amazingly enough my kid has turned out just fine. Hes got a healthy respect for firm boundaries but hes not afraid to test soft ones. Weve got zero problems with his behaviour at school and random strangers are generally impressed. Its harder work but its effective  and teaching coping skills is the only way they can learn selfdiscipline in the absence of external authority.

The reason skeletal muscle is utilized rather than proteins is because the body recognizes lack of glucose as starvation and during starvation the body is programmed to survive off of its two major energy stores  fat and muscle.  With no dietary glucose present in the blood insulin wont be secreted from the pancreas and glucagon will be in control of metabolism.  Under glucagoncontrolled metabolism the body is in a state of skeletal muscle proteolysis and adipose lipolysis.  Unless the hormone signal is changedback to insulin via glucose consumption no amount of dietary fat and protein inhibit the breakdown of skeletal muscle.  People who have been consistently on no carb diets as well as those who are simply starving both will show methylhistidine in their urine  this is a product of actinmyosin breakdown in skeletal muscle.  This is a good indicator of just how essential dietary carbs are to body function.  An interesting side note here  food supplies delivered to famine ridden areas mostly consist of dried rice packs for the simple reason that only carbs will inhibitslow the starvation process.

Working in cognitive science I guess most of your colleagues have no idea about what you are doing when presenting your computational work so how do they react? Are they trusting results from computational studies? Also do you feel like most people in your field from the cognitive side have the knowledge to tell apart good from bad studies in modelisation? I ask because I often read studies with trivial computational simulations with predictable conclusions or sometime just plainly bad studies with a bunch of free parameters that look like they have been carefully selected to give a good fit between the model and the data.

7428962,1,t1_d2mhzp7,What this study shows is that the shorter the delay the higher the probability that someone claims they choose the right red circle in trials in which they claim they had enough time to make a choice. Now it so happens that the number of times they claim they did not have enough time to make a choice is also highest at the shortest delay and going down with increasing delays. The number of times the yes  response was chosen actually stays pretty consistent across all delays. The increased probability of the yes response in the short delays seems to be due to an increase in the number of times the participants claim that they did not have enough time to make a choice and not due to an actual increase in the amount of times a yes response occurred. To me this shows that the shorter the delay the more likely people claim that they did not have enough time to choose. They authors seem to interpret it as people choosing the red circle more often that they should by pure chance which is quite a leap indeed. ,science,d2mmj60,3,t5_mouw

We also have solar system evolution models to explain the orbits of our currently known planets the Nice Model which has Jupiter Saturn and Uranus moving pretty far from their formation positions and interacting with each other in gravitational resonances to enhance those movements. Those same resonances could also result in an additional planet involved in the mix getting a very big gravitational boost to put it into a much higher and eccentric orbit than the major planets of the solar system. The important finding of this paper is that this is indeed a viable scenario given the current state of the solar systems planets. The also looked at other scenarios of an exoplanet capture but my reading of the article is that these are considered to be possible but much lower probability than the inner system planet ejection theory,science,d2u1eb5,13,t5_mouw

Some stories were fluid with lively vocabulary and as hoped participants rated them as better and more involving than others that told the same facts in a hesitating and digressive manner.gt But surprisingly attraction didnt depend on being swept up in the story  that is wouldbe partners whod produced a more engrossing story were not rated as more attractive than the bores.,science,d2zpcbw,1,t5_mouw

I am a PhD candidate doing basis research in nanotechnology so I would say I am a hybrid between a traditional physical chemist and a materials chemist. I am about half way towards the completion of my PhD and am not entirely sure what I would like to do after. I am considering doing a postdoc and then further pursuing an academic career but I am not completely set on that. I am not particularly keen on going into industry to just purely be a chemist. Thus I have also been looking into working in government or in closely related private think tankspolicy institutes as well as considering maybe transitioning to another sector like finance.

But there is a constant push and pull between the two that is likely necessary for the survival of a cultural system.

I joined a fraternity because it was made up of like minded individuals STEM types who like to socialize had structure in place for volunteer and social events had affordable room and board and offered scholarships for everything. We took care of business during the day and partied our asses off at night. Most of my class ended up going to graduatelawmed school. We also had several members that didnt drink or rarely drank. They were never pressured into drinking and usually had the same attitudes toward drink once they hit graduation. I think you could blame most of this on selfselection  people know what they want when they join and its usually what they get. If they came there to party theyre going to see an intervention as a joke and ignore it. I think thats probably the case with nonGreeks that like to party as well. ,science,d3d7b5p,-1,t5_mouw

7672265,0,t1_d3e956a,These are a basic overview of some of the biologicalevolutionary differences and how they influence behaviors with regards to children.  Luckily humans are adaptable and its not the eitheror situation that youre trying to make it.gtFor all living things the basic biological bottom line is to reproduce and have offspring that in turn have offspring. Genes of individuals that fail to reproduce are eliminated from the great evolutionary game of life. This means that the behavioral inclinations coded in those genes are not passed to subsequent generations. There are some subtleties herefor example highly social animals bees humans can often contribute some genes to the future by aiding close relatives who possess the same genes rather than reproducing themselvesbut such subtleties dont alter the basic biological reality.gtFor female mammals and certainly for female primates reproducing successfully is a very expensive proposition. Female primates carry an offspring to term protecting and nourishing it within their body often for many months. They must risk the hazards of childbirth. Then they provide milk to nourish it for weeks if not months or even years more. They must protect it care for it and support it sometimes for many additional years before it is old enough to reproduce. Women must bear protect and care for a child for a minimum of twelve to thirteen years before that child is capable of reproduction and in bearing giving birth to and rearing offspring women risk and invest far more than men do. For every parent raising children whether in the United States Brazil Thailand or Ghana the extensive costs involved in time energy risk and resources resonates deeply. And then in most cultures once a child is raised females remain involved in ensuring that the offspring of their offspringtheir grandchildrenalso survive. For females this is beyond doubt or argument an extraordinarily expensive process.gtTherefore the ideal condition for female primates is social stability for long periods. Serious social turmoil anything that threatens the life of these expensive offspring before they can reproduce is hugely counterproductive. What this has meant in womens evolutionary history is that any serious turmoilwhich certainly includes a war that might result in the womans death or the death of her childrenhas been highly counterproductive for our female primate ancestors. War for our female ancestors as well as for modern women is an extraordinarily dangerous threat to reproduction.gtFor male mammals including male primates the biological game is usually quite different because they do not invest as heavily in the survival of their children as females do. In some primates fathers contribute nothing beyond their sperm. While human males often become involved in support and protection of their young this isnt the case in all cultures see for example the Mosuo described by Hua where technically there isnt even an institution of marriagevii. In few cultures does a fathers investment approach that of a mother though there are some notable primate exceptions tamarins for example. But compared to females male mammals including male primates are generally more involved in spreading their seed widely than investing heavily in any given offspring. Should males loose offspring as a consequence of conflict or war they can more easily sire replacement offspring than females can bear give birth to and raise replacements.gtTherefore for many male primates including men social stability is not as high a priority as it is for females. In maledominated cultures for example much of mens social lives centers around rearranging the social order in their dominance hierarchies to achieve greater social status.viii Joshua Goldsteins War and Gender provides a comprehensive review of the importance of forming dominance hierarchies by male primates and that includes humans.ix Hrdy in her book The Women that Never Evolved defines dominance as the ability of one individual to influence or coerce the behavior of others usually by threatening to inflict damage but also by promising to give or withhold rewards.x Sometimes this involves using physical violence. In humans dominance does equate with status and with the ability to control others. By extension war is an expression of the inclination to controldominate others carried out on a grand scale.,science,d3eaik4,1,t5_mouw

On the other hand I think you would agree that many women do want to take a more active role in child rearing and thus choose to earn less. gtRather than just attribute blame to women we need to analyze the collective choices both women and men make and why.Its not blaming women to observe that they make different choices from men. A lot of women are happy to earn less money if it means they have more time with their children. This is especially the case if they have a higher earning spouse and women are far less likely than men to marry significantly lower earning spouses.  ,science,d3ecj5i,1,t5_mouw

The V positions behind the lead bird get filled because the other birds find it the most energetically favorable place to be then when the lead bird gets tired it falls back into one of those spots. Interesting question there is why they dont all fight for the best spots and wind up going nowhere.For the sea turtles it simply seems that the presence of more baby turtles makes it  easier. I dont think there is any coordinated behavior though. So totally density dependent as opposed to traitdependent. Would also like to point out that evidence suggests baby sea turtle mortality has little impact on population growth or size.

Thats why I strongly believe money spent on PV panel research is better invested elsewhere nuclear to solve our CO issue.However what is often forgotten where solar power can help is for water heating. If you want to use solar power install panels for water heating and not for electricity. They are far more efficient and you save more CO by doing that. Note that large scale solar power plants actually do that they heat up liquid not necessarily water I think in Andasol its some kind of oil and then drive a classical steam turbine the oil heats water. Thats why it can also produce some power at night because the heated liquid is stored.

We dont say that people with broken arms are immoral or that pointing such out is Hate Speech. To suggest that mental illness is different than physical ailments is precisely what advocates have been trying not to do for the last two decades. Thats not the argument being made here. The issue isnt with people saying others are mentally ill when they are diagnosed with mental illnesses defined in DSMV. The issue is with people calling someone mentally ill who doesnt in any way suffer from that mental illness.gt Additionally the politicization of transgender topics is grating. What precisely is transgenderism minus dysphoria? Is it like being paraplegic with the full use of your legs? Or depression without anxiety or death without the ceasing of life? From the DSMV Gender Dysphoria Fact sheetgt  It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.gt Dont be ashamed of having a mental illness. Theres nothing to be ashamed of. Youre broken same as everything else in nature. Theres always defect and diversity. Own it.Which is really beside the point. If youre mentally ill own it. Theres something wrong with you but that doesnt make you any less of a person.If someone isnt mentally ill however..

7727915,1,t1_d3kc6y2,Based solely on your comments regarding illness and the assumed need to correct a problem I would think that transgender would be easier to deal with than homosexuality. However difficult it may be to do so with a transgender diagnosis one can at least point to the difference between body and mind needing to be corrected through gender reassignment. With homosexuality the only fix is to acknowledge it as a chronic incurable condition and leave people to live their lives accordingly. My personal opinion is that the modern approach to homosexuality where enlightened society accepts it as being part of the normal range of being human is an example of a valuable goal regarding many conditions. That is not to say that there is nothing that should be treated but that we should consider carefully what we choose to treat and how we go about doing so.Getting back to how we deal with transgendered people I think we have to start with accepting that it is both within the range of being human before we consider what range of treatments are useful to the individual. ,science,d3klyai,-1,t5_mouw

These different cultures do have different hunting methods but that doesnt necessarily mean the different hunting methods are the direct cause of the differing genetic populations. The different groups do other things separately though too so a member of the same group as you will seem like a better mate sense they will share behaviors that you know are beneficial to your groups survival. And its not the same as different groups of animals hunting more of one prey in different areas because its way more complex than that. A group of wolves in one area with higher deer populations might eat mostly that while another group eats mostly rabbits and raccoon. But they wouldnt develop a completely different hunting method and separate themselves sexually. The orcas have developed complex hunting methods that require tremendous team work and intelligence. Its not just hunting different prey its an entirely different way of surviving and since survival is what really matters in the wild a culture forms around it. On top of that the groups of orcas diets arent necessarily controlled by the abundance of food in their area its controlled by what the pod likes to hunt. Theyll still chose to hunt seals if thats what they do even if there is way more fish around. Its a lot more like an ancient indigenous culture that is huntergatherer vs agricultural to me. They hunters may have hunting gods and animal gods they worship while the farmers have sun and rain gods. The way we survive and choose to live our lives is what creates a culture. ,science,d3r5eu3,34,t5_mouw

7808551,0,t1_d3tq2op,While its true that education and religion have historically been connected I think you are creating a false dichotomy when you say that universities and upper classes secularization either led or followed one another. By necessity they happened concurrently.Secular movements have existed within academia since before ancient Grecian philosophy. Secular movements wax or wane in support depending on the political and social landscapes within which they existed. In ancient Greece secularism was a respected branch of philosophy and was a topic for debate. That is because there werent direct punitive consequences for being an atheist and the spread of ideas was popular sociologically. Comparatively in modern Turkey less than  of the population is Atheist due to crushing social pressures and harsh apostasy laws.When a social or political landscape or both change in such a way that secularism is likely to expand BOTH the upper classes and education are going to concurrently become more secular because they are generally the same groups of people. Wealth is strongly positively correlated with education. That being said if one is driving the other it is likely education leading the way as it is directly responsible for exposure to secular ideas.

In addition the Kyoto process and climaterelated policies represented a low cost for the countries involved  up to . of GDP for the European Union and an even lower fraction of Japans GDP. This is around one quarter to one tenth of what experts had estimated after the agreement was reached in  for delivering the targets set  years ahead. The US never ratified the Treaty and Canada withdrew but all the rest continued and Kyoto came into force in .gtThe results reported in the Climate Policy journal are the first published results to use the final data for national GHG emissions and exchanges in carbon units which only became available at the end of . They show that overall the countries who signed up to the Kyoto Protocol surpassed their commitment by . GtCOe yr  gigatonnes of CO equivalent per year.gtThere is often skepticism about the importance of international law and many critics claim that the Kyoto Protocol failed. The fact that countries have fully complied is highly significant and it helps to raise expectations for full adherence to the Paris Agreement said Prof. Michael Grubb EditorinChief of the Climate Policy journal and cofounder of research network Climate Strategies.gtThe researchers found that most of these countries reduced their GHG emissions to the levels required by the Kyoto Protocol with only nine Austria Denmark Iceland Japan Lichtenstein Luxembourg Norway Spain and Switzerland emitting higher levels. The nine countries only just overshot their targets  in total by around  of the average annual emissions capped under Kyoto  and were able to comply with the Protocol using the flexibility mechanisms. The researchers also found that overall compliance would have also been achieved even without the socalled hotair windfall emission reductions from Eastern Bloc countries.,science,d478rh3,9,t5_mouw

7932035,0,t1_d47b6j4,gtsince dumping the tritiated water from even Fukushima in the ocean would barely increase oceanic concentrations past homeopathic levels...You do realize the ocean is separated into layers right?     The ocean is not just some big swimming pool.    The top layer of the ocean is called the mixed layergtThe mixed layer is characterized by being nearly uniform in properties such as temperature and salinity throughout the layer. Velocities however may exhibit significant shears within the mixed layer. The bottom of the mixed layer is characterized by a gradient where the water properties change. Oceanographers use various definitions of the number to use as the mixed layer depth at any given time based on making measurements of physical properties of the water. Often an abrupt temperature change called a thermocline occurs to mark the bottom of the mixed layer sometimes there may be an abrupt salinity change called a halocline that occurs as well. The combined influence of temperature and salinity changes results in an abrupt density change or pycnocline. Additionally sharp gradients in nutrients nutricline and oxygen oxycline and a maximum in chlorophyll concentration are often colocated with the base of the seasonal mixed layer.What this all means is that the top layer of the ocean gets mixed by wind and waves so it has uniform properties and there are boundaries where this mixing stops and the properties of the water changes relatively sharply.  This mixed layer depth was measuredgtFrom  profiles the average mixed layer depth in the western equatorial Pacific during the two WEPOCS cruises was  m which is about a factor of  shallower than had previously been thought. The mean depth of the top of the thermocline was found to be  m so there is a nearly isothermal layer that is deeper than the mixed layer. This discrepancy is attributable to salinity stratification.Yes Japan is not western equatorial but the point is that when you are talking about layers of mixed water that can get as low as  meters  arguments based on having the radiation mixed with the whole ocean are shown to be based on false assumptions.  When you factor in ocean currents and the mixed layer of water on the ocean surface you start to realize that the radioactive elements leaking from Fukushima are not as well dispersed as most people assume. ,science,d47mw3f,3,t5_mouw

We will continue to see a gradual decrease in many manual labor jobs due to automation and other things.  Now certain manual labor type jobs may not be easily replaced such as plumbers electricians etc. however the total number of manual labor jobs has been reduced across the board. Also the total availability of work in these medium to high skill manual labor positions is far less than the demand for such work by employees.Further I predict that in the next decade or so we will also see a big drop in the service industry jobs as well due to automation...   if say Mcdonalds pursues kitchen operations automation you will see the creation of  positions involving the maintenance and operation of those machines which are medium to high skill level type jobs and the elimination of a dozen or two low skill labor manual labor ones. ,science,d4h3sm5,1,t5_mouw

What gene changes drive beta cell exhaustionfailure to cause TD is the big unknown in the field. We need to test whether reducing RCAN in beta cells stops this but its difficult because mouse models arent perfect and human islets from TD are so rare to obtain.

The making of fertilizer and the transport of agriculturally related things takes an enormous amount of hydrocarbons and as you imply yourself the carbon footprint of beef farming is enormous. There are sustainable ways to farm animals and the end product of a holistic farm can be far healthier for us than the current output of meats and eggs. But we should acknowledge too that we need to feed an increasing number of people and to do this without the consequences of a high carbon footprint is likely going to need genetic modifications. Many people find this uncomfortable and in an unregulated or poorly regulated environment I dont blame them. But if GM agriculture is necessary then we should make sure that the equally necessary regulations and safeguards are in place too.

8113187,0,t1_d4qypfm,gtSo is there any reason why the Navy doesnt just use a different kind of plane instead of having to compromise and share with the air force?The Navy has continuously had problems procuring aircraft for like  years. They keep ending up scrambling to pick something because their current aircraft are end of life and all their development attempts at a replacement fail. They were extraordinarily lucky with Grumman and the F which was hastily designed after the FB turned out to be a nonstarter. They ended up picking a real turd with the FCD but only because they dicked around so long that congress said pick something already in development and do it right now so they said fine well take whatever the USAF didnt pick and ended up with a badly navalized YF. Then theres the FEF which is a case of the Navy saying we cant risk trying to develop another failed jet and some clever guy at McDonnell Douglass saying how about an upgraded F... resulting in essentially a whole new jet the size of an F that only superficially resembles the small light fighter it replaced having only like  parts commonality.With a track record like that its not surprising that theyd go along with a joint development. The problem is that within the Navy there are too many people pulling in different directions and insisting on a myriad of capabilities some of them mutually exclusive.

Theoretically speaking you expect a certain performance from a battery and you rarely ever get there. People have been at a loss to understand all the factors that contribute to this lack of full capacity. This study points us in that direction.Using one of the worlds most powerful soft Xray microscopes  the Scanning Transmission Xray Microscope STXM  at the Canadian Light Source CLS in tandem with decades of combined experience in materials science Banerjee and collaborators from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Binghamton University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST were able to image a traffic jam of lithium ions chemically driven through the nanowirebased channels of a simulated battery.For a battery to function properly you need to get lithium ions in and you need to be able to pull them out Banerjee said.

However global warming has increased the temperature without El Nio. As a result we are seeing more bleaching with smaller El Nio events than we used to. In fact the current global bleaching event started before this El Nio did and the biggest Caribbean bleaching was not during a significant El Nio. You can read more about the current bleaching event and how it relates to the El Nio here The two things we have to do to reduce bleaching is  reduce the amount of CO in the atmosphere and  reduce local stressors to enhance the resilience of the coral reef.  means reducing problems of overfishing pollution habitat destruction and physical impacts on corals by divers or boaters,science,d4u9hx0,1,t5_mouw

They dont understand that its not an even playing field or even acknowledge it when you explain it like you did in your comment.The answer to your original question is tricky. Something has to be true before you can prove that its true and this has a lot of good indications that it is but its nowhere close to proven so it kind of falls into the same category as some of the quack medicine marketed as natural and that sort of stuff for now.As a parallel if you are interested in losing weight exercise can help change what foods you crave but I think losing weight is a bad reason to exercise. I think it leads to selfloathing frustration and failure. Playing sports because you enjoy them or training because you want to improve needs to be where the motivation comes from.,science,d5cob1o,2,t5_mouw
8282436,0,t3_4swe7h,The research by scientists at Swansea University and British Antarctic Survey is published in the journal Science today Friday July . The study reports that glaciers flowing to the coast on the western side of the Peninsula show a distinct spatial correlation with ocean temperature patterns with those in the south retreating rapidly but those in the north showing little change. Some  of the  glaciers in this region have retreated since records began in the s.Dr Alison Cook who led the work at Swansea University says Scientists know that ocean warming is affecting large glaciers elsewhere on the continent but thought that atmospheric temperatures were the primary cause of all glacier changes on the Peninsula.

With this study stating that the aerosols themselves can cause irritation that takes this away from just the cheap ecigarettes and pushes it into all ecigarettes.  The type of aerosol may make a huge difference in how much irritation is caused with possibly some formulations not causing any problem but I can not speak to that.We already know from both cigarettes and asbestos that ongoing irritation of the lungs can lead to lung cancer so...

One would be wrong.Enforcing the current laws would reduce crime to a level at which future laws arent needed.This is directly contrary to the wants of the people passing most gun laws.Hence why straw purchasers arent prosecuted And when they do get caught they get super lenient sentences. gtA federal judge in Atlanta on Monday sentenced Jalita Johnson  to one year of probation for lying when she bought the gun in April. Johnson bought the Glock semiautomatic handgun plus a round drum magazine and ammunition from a pawnshop in Jonesboro Georgia.gtJohnson replied yes to a question on a form asking whether she was the actual buyer of the gun.gtProsecutors said Johnsons boyfriend Marcus Wheeler a felon gave her money and told her what to buy.Keep in mind the punishment for that particular crime is a  year felony and they sentenced her to probation. Barbara Cleveland got  months in jail for straw purchasing at least  guns the absolute minimum from the sentencing guidelines she appealed this as being too harshgtThe jury found Barbara and her brother guilty on both counts. Barbara faced a statutory maximum of  years imprisonment as well as guideline ranges of  to  months imprisonment and  to  years supervised release.gtThe court found that a guideline sentence would be appropriate.

Many states have rather strict laws about howwhere you store your guns  you cant leave a loaded gun in your car or in your nightstand in my state for example. My state requires that you keep your guns in a gun safe with trigger locks on and ammunition stored separately when not on your person.But in reality people who feel the need to carry a gun for safety not people who shoot occasionally for sport probably arent doing all of that. Theyre probably leaving a gun in their car so they dont get carjacked. Theyre leaving a gun in their nightstand in case a burglar breaks in.

However many residential burglariesperhaps up to  percentgo unreported.Now a little logic.......If you dont report a burglary for whatever reason and a police officer shows up on your doorstep saying that he found your gun and the police officer asks you why you did not report it as stolen. How are you going to react?  You are already on the defensive and look suspicious for not reporting a crime.  You dont know if somebody may have used your gun in another crime or if there may be an ongoing investigation.  Maybe they want to bring you in for questioning.  What is the easiest way out of this very uncomfortable situation?  Tell the cop that you did not know the gun was stolen.

But since the bacteria are airborne how terrifying it could spread like dandelion seeds across the region. Maybe anyway. If thats the case Id love an invention where wed create a tiny net for us to capture the bacteria and keep them contained. It would seem risky to get even close to the area unless those brave souls want to be in quarantine for a x amount of time. Oh goodness concentrations of bacteria? Never occurred to me! From my limited layman knowledge bacteria are hearty little things that adapt rather quickly. This article is a great example of that.

8511951,0,t3_4wa0cr,Hello Doctor Pimentel and thank you for coming to Reddit. You are just the type of person I would enjoy to hear some feedback.Last October I started having strange indigestion. I went to the docs office and they told me that I had taken too many NSAIDs to deal with my back pain from a canoe trip. They said I had an ulcer.But this wasnt the case. I was taking proton pump inhibitors and this actually made me more sick. Eventually I had an upper endoscopy done to see if I had any sores in my stomach and also take a sample for celiac.Suffice it to say they found nothing. But during the time between scheduling for my upper endoscopy and the occurrence of the symptoms I stopped eating gluten products. So if i have celiac we may never know.To this day I still deal with a little discomfort but I have definitely noticed a decent improvement when I dont eat gluten. No matter if its simply contamination from food made in a plant with other wheat products I will feel awful the next day. In a few days it heals just a little. But even so  there are plenty of times where I just dont feel good. Even if I havent had wheat contamination around me.My questions for you are do you believe in gluten sensitivity? Is there any of your research involving the affects of gluten on the GI tract? I have also read there is speculation that microbiota might even be involved the process of breaking down the gluten molecule. So more importantly should I look into microbiota treatments instead? ,science,d65juoi,1,t5_mouw

8557081,0,t3_4wy39o,Temporary Reddit hug of death it seems. But I just got through. Heres the text if youre having issuesSurfaces that discourage bacterial growth are in high demand particularly as more patients require catheters and implants. Last month we reported on a new antibacterial surface that incorporates molecular compounds that can block bacterias ability to communicate and form biofilms which interferes with their capacity to resist antibiotics and coordinate an assault on the host.On an implant human cells and bacterial cells compete to colonize the surface. Obviously any surface that can give the upper hand to human cells is preferable. So an international team of researchers used nanotopology to devise a surface that physically rips apart bacteria while leaving human cells alone.The team was aware of prior research on dragonfly wings which are composed of bactericidal nanostructures. A synthetic material with similar bactericidal properties is called black silicon. As shown in the image above black silicon is made up of tiny spikes reminiscent of a bed of nails. Because bacteria are very tiny these spikes place tremendous mechanical stress on them and they rupture. But human i.e. eukaryotic cells are gigantic by comparison. Like a human laying on a bed of nails these cells should in theory be just fine.To test this the team coated surfaces with either black silicon bSi or regular silicon Si and preinfected them with either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus both human pathogens. Then they added cells from monkey kidneys called COS cells to determine how they fared in the presence of pathogens with or without black silicon. See figure below.As shown above the monkey cells colored green had a hard time growing in the presence of bacteria if there was no specialized black silicon surface. P. aeruginsoa completely precluded the monkey cells from growing on the regular silicon surface while S. aureus made the monkey cells sickly. On the other hand if grown on the black silicon surface the bacteria were killed and the monkey cells grew quite nicely. Furthermore the black silicon surface is capable of killing both Grampositive thick cell wall represented by S. aureus and Gramnegative two outer membranes represented by P. aeruginosa bacteria.Importantly the authors demonstrated that black silicon does not appear to cause problems for eukaryotic cells. Microscopy revealed that the monkey cells membranes deformed around and engulfed the tiny spikes. Additionally black silicon was implanted into mice and did not trigger an inflammatory response.The authors conclude that to their knowledge this is the first time that it has been demonstrated that eukaryotic cells can grow on a surface that had previously been contaminated with deadly bacteria. Hopefully the authors are seeking to commercialize this technology as it seems to be quite full of promise.Source Vy T. H. Pham et al. Race for the surface eukaryotic cells can win. ACS Appl. Mater.

Well turns out thats not true its good for a variety of reasons and were just finding out what some of them are. It can only be common sense if you know the background.Likewise with astrocytes a cell type in the brain. For the longest time they were just seen as supporters for neurons which were regarded THE essential nerve cells. Well turns out astrocytes do much more than that. Ive collaborated with a research group once found out that astrocytes also produce signals which are much slower and of a different type than the neuronal ones. Everybody thought they were crazy and doing bad work. Well turns out it was true. Turns out astrocytes are responsible for a myriad of functions and were just finding out which ones they are.When you look at the DNA as our source code it seems so absolutely obvious. However when the DNA structure was discovered and the suggestion of the code of life was made the vast part of the scientific elite decided that was a bunch of bullshit. For a long time. Well they were wrong.The thing is scientists should be open to new ideas and especially should be open the ideas that challenge their own work.

In East Antarctica however our understanding of their behaviour and impact is more limited. Using gt optical satellite images and meteorological records from  we provide the first multiyear analysis of lake evolution on Langhovde Glacier Dronning Maud Land S E. We observe  lakes and  surface channels up to . km inland   m a.s.l. from the grounding line and document three pathways of lake demise i refreezing ii drainage to the ensubglacial environment on the floating ice and iii overflow into surface channels on both the floating and grounded ice. The parallels between these mechanisms and those observed on Greenlandthe Antarctic Peninsula suggest that lakes may similarly affect rates and patterns of ice melt ice flow and ice shelf disintegration in East Antarctica.,science,d6p7zwf,2,t5_mouw

If you properly design an experiment and control for everything it certainly can support causality. Read the wikipedia article on this and better yet something like Causality by Judea Pearl. The way correlation doesnt  imply causality is used in reddit in the vast majority of cases is so general and an abusive memefication of that phrase. There are certainly many times for appropriate use of that phrase. However It would be as if one designed an experiment in a vacuum chamber where you hit the ball with a hammer measure its trajectory and conclude that the energy of the hammer was partially transferred to the ball causing it to move in the exact trajectory measured and given by classical mechanics and a redditor could just dismiss that conclusion because correlation does not imply causality. ,science,d6pvnl9,2,t5_mouw

8760183,0,t3_500ksa,Wouldnt it make more sense to just make the process of swapping batteries for electric cars easier? The batteries at swapping stations could be charged via solar energy and loaned with a minimal fee similar to the price of a full tank of gas. Hell it might even create a new market for the oil companies. They put up battery swapping stations and to ensure that they remain carbon neutral a law could be enacted that requires them to charge their batteries with noncarbon based alternative energy. Not that Im supporting the idea that oil companies should gain control of another market but hell if it means the death of fossil fuels and the start of a cleaner future Im all for it.,science,d70om1u,30,t5_mouw

Intelligence as in spies espionage satellites etc. Knowing what the other country is doing and thinking not always as glamorous as a movie.One week he told us he wouldnt be present for the next weeks classes. You see the President needed him to advise on some matters of Intelligence.I also took a couple classes with one of the worlds top experts for ethnomusicology  the study of music in cultural contexts looking at how different cultures understand music how styles and instruments spread etc. In the past several decades there has been a real attempt to record music of the world  much like some indigenous languages are disappearing so too are many types of indigenous music. For the better half of a century people have been trying to collect and record the little that is left. He would wistfully tell you how the subject of his work and life for decades was basically over because everyone just listens to Britney Spears now.Tough class but loved it. Getting to hear lessons from one of the top experts in a small field someone who was passionate and realistic about their work... really a thrill.

8793085,0,t1_d73w972,Your question as I get is is phrased as Wouldnt this ONLY apply when the disadvantaged population has a large enough disadvantage that more often than not it kills the animal before it can procreate?The this is evolutionary advantages.There are hugely numbers of different animals with different strategies about creating the next generation.  Humans eg spend a lot of time protecting and raising children almost for  of their lives far more than other animals.  In humans this mean that parents who have certain qualities will better protect children giving them an advantage.  This end game of this is that humans will be selected to live longer healthier so that they are able to provide this care.  Hence the evolutionary pressure on humans is to select for longer lives because children needs so much care for such long periods.  It is perhaps not surprising that humans start to age about  years after they stop being fertile that is about  fertility declines and at about  humans start to age more quickly after  years of raising the last child.So in humans having a disadvantage after you procreated may be serious because it may lead to to your death and then to the death of your children before they are established as adults.  So in humans there are evolutionary pressures  even after children are born procreation has occurred.  This is not the case for may other animal and plant species.And this is very different in other animal species because there other strategies and different environments shaping the evolutionary forces.What makes this more complex is that even in the absence of evolutionary pressures there are random mutations and drift in the genome.  Geographically separating species and then waiting a long time will result in two different species even if there were no evolutionary pressures  just the random drift will cause the gene pools to become separated.,science,d74t5tn,1,t5_mouw

8830610,0,t1_d79a0pe,I think its disingenuous to say people dont eat themselves into diabetes and then say that exercise and diet are critical for preventing Type  diabetes. Genetic disposition plays a role but it only sets the stage.  Placing stress on the insulin production can be prevented or sped up depending on how much sugar is constantly in the bloodstream.  You can move yourself into and out of the diabetes range by measuring your Ac levels by what you eat and how much you burn off through exercise.I checked out the blog and while I appreciate the links to actual science and reputable sources it still reads as conspiracy theory saying that the medical community is hiding information about diabetes and purporting doctors as uncaring towards diabetics until they can put them on the newest most expensive potentially dangerous but heavily marketed drugs.,science,d79bdqz,0,t5_mouw

8832674,0,t1_d79jewl,No magic bullet on the horizon but successful interventions will probably be pharmacological like substances to trick the body into delaying meal initiation and speeding up meal termination. There is a lot of basic research being done on how the normal hunger and satiation signals produced by the body are altered in overeatingobesity and how they might be normalized to promote weight loss quiet the hunger signals and amplify the satiation signals. On the other side of things its well known that as people lose weight their bodies become more energy efficient and their metabolisms slow down combating this is another focus. And yes amphetamines hit both sides but unfortunately are very much so not safe and its surprisingly difficult to find a drug therapy that works but wont get you addicted andor give you a heart attack. Obesity is interesting because behavioral modification is in most cases all that is needed to treat the issue but it is so so difficult to modify something as innate as eating palatable food PLUS the body is fighting the weight loss the whole way. We really do have to resort to fooling the body.Sorry for all the edits tired and on mobile.Extra edit a commenter brought up fecal transplants yes this is another potential therapy that I believe is undergoing clinical trial.

In short I dont know the answers to these questions. We know there is a cue of some kind that oyster larvae use to select where to settle and that genetically diverse reefs get more larvae so presumably they smell better or are more likely to contain the compounds a particular larvae is looking for. There is some great work by Danielle Dixon and Mark Hay looking at preferences of coral larvae and all sorts of coral reef species to water collected from protected reefs vs. degraded reefs. In short everything prefers the healthy coral reef. As far as if other oyster reef species can distinguish between diverse and less diverse reefs we havent tested that yet. I did read some articles recently that fish did lose some ability to orient under OA. The pesticides we use have very short halflives and do not bioaccumulate. I dont know that crabs or other animals can tell if oysters have toxins or not.

There is so much external stimuli at a concert its hard to tell reality from the trip sometimes. In a quiet room its just you versus your own mind. Introversion can lead down some uncomfortably rabbit holes. Being quiet helps you focus. You stare at stuff it starts to move. You look around constantly the visuals have less opportunity to manifest themselves. Also theres a certain comfort to being surrounded by scantly clad members of your preferred sex that takes your mind off fear. Finally I think dancing reduces anxiety as well as having an environment you can freely explore and friendly people.If you feel self conscious about dancing and the scary hippies look sinister and you hate the music then I do agree youd be better off elsewhere!,science,d7jyylt,2,t5_mouw

This is extremely welldocumented. Why does your study completely ignore this fact? Are the emissions benefits which are dubious at best not completely offset by the fact that most cars older than  are completely incompatible with ethanol simply due a fixed fuel pressure?As a mechanic I would love to voice my support for the UCS but it is incredibly disingenuous to pretend that ethanol blended fuel is good for consumers and the environment.

When I need more power than my panels produce my meter spins forward. When I need to charge my electric vehicle I plug it in to my house. I have replaced the need to go to fossil fuel based stations by turning my house into a charging station. If this became the norm then none of us would need fossil fuel based stations. By all being tied to the grid then when one of us is away from our home charging station we can go to Fast Charging stations which pull that excess energy from the grid and fill up our batteries there.

8999221,0,t1_d7tcwhr,gt I question how the issue of IP is not exacerbated by the use of gmos. Because the legal issues are not different depending on whether the trait is achieved through genetic engineering or through traditional breeding as far as I am aware. I would love to be informed of any differences.gt Although issues of IP exist currently without gmos the first living thing to be patented was a genetically modified bacterium. And how is this relevant given that you can patent nonGMO organisms? Does the fact that it was a bacterium remove the concern with regards to plants? If not why should the fact that it was a GMO remove the concerns in regard to nonGMO?gtAlso the US Supreme Court ruled in  that mere isolation of a genetic strain is not sufficient to claim IP. The cultivars uses in modern farming are not simply isolated so I fail to see the relevance.gtWhat has happened in many cases is that farms growing their own seed that are located near gmo farms have crops that pollinate with the gmo plants and are later sued for unlicensed usage of corporate IP resulting in the economic destruction of independent and family farms across the world.Do you have a source for this? It is a claim often used when discussing GMO but every time a source has been provided it has turned out not to be nonintentional contamination but rather to be very much on purpose by the farmer who are later sued. Again I would love to see a case where this was not the case.,science,d7tkf31,3,t5_mouw

It can be shown that travelling faster than c causes t to become negative. With the way we view that that means that the effect would precede the cause. This then would seem to suggest the information was sent to the past. From my understanding there is actually no violation present here in the theoretical sense. You simply have t.

9092384,0,t3_54qwzg,This is a quire interesting find. With this they can reverse engineer the the possible dna sequence it came from. However before people get excited the gene they end up making will not be that of the original.I studied some of these techniques when I was doing my biochem undergrad and the basic concept is that since we know the codons for each amino acid the gene can be deduced. However the issue is  and there are a few are codon degeneracy Because a single amino acid can have multiple codons the number of possible genes that can be generated can be huge. If we looked at an oligopeptide such as metmetmetpro we can see that there is only  codon that can make methionine but  codons that make proline. as a result we end up making  different genes. Sure each gene produces the same product in theory but we dont know which version worked the best in the living animal. It like getting an extremely close knock off of an iphone.  post transnational modifications when we look at a gene in an organism and then compare it to the mrna we find that the mrna is much smaller then the gene and then when we compare it to the protein the protein is much smaller. the differences in each macro molecules size is due to the cleaving of regulatory segments that control the expression of the molecules and expose site for modification. one such sequence in proteins is the n terminal signal. this is a short peptide that directs a protein for folding in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once the protein to be made is transported that signal is cut off. if we were to take one of our generated genes and express it that signal is not there and what ends up being produced may end up being a misfolded mess. so what will be the direction of this research based on what ive said above. We know that we have gene homology with many organisms that are currently alive such as with yeast or lab mice but we also share homology with creatures in the past. This makes sense becuase our genes derived from what was from the past. What they may end up doing is using the genes that they generate from the protein sequence and use them as dna probes to find genes that share homology with probe. It will be difficult becuase remember that a polypeptide sequence is drastically smaller then any gene. hope this helps.,science,d84raw8,10,t5_mouw

9102604,0,t1_d85c256,We did examine sex as one of more than  potential predictors of progression from MCI to AD. However our analysis was not designed to identify every possible predictor of MCItoAD progression but rather to identify a small number of predictors that when used together maximized the accuracy of the prediction. The best performing model incorporated scores from cognitivefunctional assessments and structural MRI measures and predicted progression with  accuracy. Although sex may have an effect on the rates of cognitive and functional decline as suggested by Lin et al.  our analyses did not identify sex as a unique predictor that added significant predictive information over and above the other included predictors. Its possible that the effects of sex are already in part reflected in the cognitive  functional assessments and brain MRI measures that were selected as predictors in our model i.e. predictive information provided by sex may be redundant. Alternatively its possible that sex was not identified as a reliable predictor of progression in our study because we used a different dependent variable than Lin et al. Because we used a binary outcome variable clinical diagnosis of progression or no progression from MCI to AD dementia as opposed to a more finegrained outcome variable such as scores on a specific cognitive or functional assessment e.g. ADASCog CDR as used by Lin et al. our approach may not have been sensitive enough to identify sex as a predictor of progression.,science,d85zjly,4,t5_mouw

9114354,0,t1_d87de7y,Are you responding to me or the comment above? My response was offering a phenomenological explanation to umagus s question about advantage. I was positing that regardless of any systemic bias or aptitude differences the observation is that you have  capable engineers who get hired and they run an even gender split. In that all things being equal in todays climate companies actually think and take note of the gender breakdown of their engineering departments and that a company with a department lagging in women engineers can both acquire a new capable engineer and help offset a gender imbalance that they may be trying to correct.These factors can contribute to the relative competitiveness of a female engineering graduate when compared with her equally capable male graduates. At no point do any of the new hires have any sort of capability deficit but rather external factors combine to make them a more sought after candidate.My point was that from the frame of reference of another male graduate who didnt get hired maybe from a capability deficit or just all the spots being filled he may interpret the relative percentages of female graduates w jobs and wo jobs to the male statistics and lament the unfairness of the situation. Edit I elaborated in further comment chains that I wasnt making value judgments about the oughtness of the situation rather describing a hypothetical breakdown of events leading to a student calling the system unfair wo a proper contextual understanding.,science,d87ecgj,13,t5_mouw

So lets say I want some pancreatic beta cells that I can transplant into a patient with diabetes. How do we go from an ESC into a functioning beta cell? Well it turns out its really really difficult. We dont really know how to do it and we need to be very careful because if we mess up the cells can go haywire and form tumors in the patient. But we are learning from embryos because embryos know how to take an ESC and turn it into a functioning beta cell. A blastocyst early embryo is essentially a ball of ESCs as the embryo develops the ESCs go down different paths some become heart cells some become blood cells some become kidney cells etc. So stem cell biologist are going back to the embryo and studying how it develops in order to replicate it in petri dishes.,science,d8mi9a6,60,t5_mouw

9309491,0,t1_d8vlpvr,I work with nanoparticles as catalysts. Currently the majority of pharmaceuticals and chemicals produced require at least one type of catalyst and are typical homogenous catalysts. Homogenous catalysts are free nanoparticles small molecules metal salts etc. The issue here is that these homogenous catalysts are typically one time use only. I think you can imagine that this is less than desirable and cost ineffective.My research focuses on heterogenous catalysts which the nanoparticle small molecule etc. is put on a much larger support material. By putting a nanoparticle on the support we are able to recycle the catalyst and use it multiple times.This is just one example of recylcing nanoparticles.I also worked with magnetic nanoparticles which have the benefit of being easily extracted from a solution by an external magnet so you can reuse them easily.,science,d8w1nz4,2,t5_mouw

9348953,0,t1_d90zmsp,As a though experiment.Probably carrying animals back instead of eating what you could and leaving the rest was a logical benefit of walking in two legs.Still animals are heavy and you need to split them up. Pulling and tearing is a possibility but it would need help. Moreover some animals are just too big and you need to break the bones. The solution is to smash the parts with a stone and carry that.Throwing the stones was certainly not a good solution you would want to crack at it carefully make sure you dont break the gall bladder and poison the meat with bile etc. From here on it was probably noted that some stones were better at cutting the animal apart and then at some point someone found out you could improve sharp stones by sharpening them further and it made sense you could even sharpen stones that werent sharp at all to begin with.And then youd get tools.Of course who knows if this was how it happened at all. We cant even be sure if stone tools really were first maybe they are just the oldest tools that could survive until now. Maybe bones and sticks came before.

The process of losing weight is clearly far more complicated than simple CICO but the mechanism by which weight loss is achieved is entirely dependent on creating energy imbalance. None of the things you mention can create or destroy energy. CICO is heavily promoted for weight loss because it is an incredibly powerful tool when used appropriately. When people say all that matters is a calorie deficit they are not trying to claim there are no other factors that influence ones ability to lose weight but rather that energy imbalance is literally all the only physical requirement for weight loss. Its become vogue to turn around and distort that into a straw man claim that humans are robots who can easily regulate calorie intake no matter their circumstances which basically no one is is actually saying.,science,d9553t4,5,t5_mouw

Thats the source of the hostility in case you didnt realise it You misrepresented what I said to try and discredit my statement. EDIT And apparently have now edited your original response to a more accurate one. Thank you.Adrenaline is one of the stress hormones. The article demonstrates very clearly that stress hormones have detrimental effects on accurate recall. Lack of accurate recall produces poor results in the memory test used in the article. If you want me to produce a paper where someone injected with adrenaline takes that specific memory test I probably cant find one but if I have to provide peerreviewed evidence for questioning whether an article has taken account of confounding factors theres no way at all to question any innovative papers because there is no concrete evidence that a potential confounding factor is a confounding factor.Adrenaline affects higher brain function. This is established scientific fact. Thats what the fight or flight response is about. It is entirely reasonable to assume a hormone that inhibits higher brain function will affect your performance in certain tests of brain function.

Whoever attempts to kick it first will likely win the battle so its a case of two people making an instantaneous subjective decisions as to when they should go for the ball. Ergo this leads to players going for the ball too early in an attempt to take the initiative in a sense. Imagine the ball has been passed into the penalty box. As a defender you would make the decision between a potential goal or a possibly reckless challenge. If they allow the former they wouldnt be doing their jobs.

Also placebo is clearly inferior to a truly working medication. I mean if the medication truly works you in effect get both belief in the medication AND a true effect whereas a placebo only delievers the belief not to mention that a sizeable minority get no placebo some even get the opposite the nocebo. When you test a medication against a control groupplacebo the noncontrol group has to get a statistically significant better result for the medication to be counted as valid.

Lets assume that we got an answer that said same sex couples children had more behavioral issues. What could you extrapolate from that ? The only real take away form a study like that is Dont be gay. Not scientifically useful. Instead you could study kids with behavioral issues and find cross overs in parenting style. Such as spanking types of discipline and level of discipline. Then you could study those things specifically and find out how they relate to parenting. If you actually wanted to address issues caused by same sex couple raising childrenif they existed. You should study parenting styles and then find what has a negative effect on children. Then study if there is a higher or lower rate of those styles between same sex and non same sex couples. Studying just behavior issues in children with same sex parents tell us nothing. Because even if we got a result that would merit follow up. We would need to do a study to find out what to follow up. So why not just skip it and study parenting styles and their effects on kids. Like a recent study about how chores help children be successful later in life and that spanking causes more behavioral issues in children not less.

9484241,0,t1_d9hwee8,This answer is much more of a personal feeling since this is outside of my field of expertise but I did do a literature review a few months ago on the subject. Theres research being done by panel or equipment manufacturers on using different polymer front encapsulation for example. But why not use glass you might ask? Glass is impenetrable by airwater and is transparent to UV. Unfortunately glass is expensive and heavy. It turns out they are also prone to delamination failure through side infiltration anyway especially since we have moved to frameless panels. Thus polymer front sheet are becoming the norm at least for consumer based installations and its a good thing. Lighter and cheaper is the way to go in my humble view. As for your question my feeling is that there is two failure timelines being addressed and they are both constrained by module price restrictionreduction goals transparency requirements and strict manufacturing conditions. Manufacturers are making sure the panels dont mechanically fail in the short term from  weeks to  years for example. Water infiltration is a bitch and it can happen within weeks of putting a new module out in the weather dont forget heat UV high wind hail etc.. Once youve passed this first short term threshold youre in for the long term failure which you are hoping is as slow as possible and that depends a lot on the polymer type and formulation manufacturing processes and other adhesives being used UV degradation. Most organic materials including our skin is prone to UV degradation unfortunately...Very few materials can withstand weather for decades paints lose their colors and peel off plastics become yellow and brittle metals rust wood bends etc. In the end solar panels are the technological products I know that are the most stable especially given the price point. They are usually guaranteed for decades and are relatively easy to recycle and replace at endoflife Basel convention. Put them on your roof and the roof will fail before the solar panels.You can look at publications from Meyer Burger not affiliated for studies on encapsulation adhesives and failure rates for different manufacturing processes and encapsulations.Personal rant here we usually shit on Chinese manufacturers that have driven prices of modules deep into the ground but I have yet to hear or read anything negative about the failure rates of their modules please prove me wrong if it isnt the case!. With that said dumping prices did screw every PV startup a few years back and chances of new tech emerging. But the exponential growth were seeing in the PV industry is due to a maturing technology and mass manufacturing in China.,science,d9i4xdi,2,t5_mouw

9513194,0,t1_d9lh9li,DB The word moderate has a lot of different meanings depending on who you ask. In some of my work Ive argued that a lot of people we think of as moderate are actually more extreme than the people we typically think of on the far left and the far right.The idea is this. Quite often when we try to figure out how liberal or conservative someone is in general we average over their views on many different topics. By this measure you see no surprise that Republicans are pretty conservative they have conservative opinions on most things and Democrats are pretty liberal they have liberal opinions on most things. However most people have a mix of liberal and conservative opinions  e.g. maybe they oppose gay marriage but favor taxing the rich or support gay marriage but oppose taxing the rich. These are the moderates. What I show in my work is that these people are actually less likely to have moderate opinions on the individual issues. So when it comes to taxes for example moderates who have some liberal views and some conservative views are actually more likely to favor extreme ideas like a maximum national income or no taxes whatsoever.The intuitive reason for this is that hardcore Democrats adopt the Democratic position on most issues and hardcore Republicans adopt the Republican position on most issues. By definition these positions are within the mainstream because many people share them. But moderates are generally less engaged with politics and less likely to adopt the parties positions as they own  which leaves them both with a mix of liberal and conservative positions and with positions that arent within the mainstream of American politics.,science,d9lpcgj,10,t5_mouw

It seems logical that for sensing motor intent in the persons brain you might attach sensing apparatus closer to the limbs but what have we learned in this field in general?  If it helps my interest is in controlling external soundvideo synthesizers with thought.,science,d9oaqrw,3,t5_mouw

Ive been able to keep a nichrome coil going for months by burning off the old liquid deposits it does not oxidize or offgas at all.  As long as there is liquid around the coil it will remain far below any temperature required to start offgassing metal think of boiling water in a paper cup as long as water is inside the cup it will never burn.  I only replaced it because I was bending it around too much trying to load it with cotton and snapped it.Edit only lung issue Ive had so far was a cough that lasted for about two weeks but I found out that I was sensitive to propylene glycol and have since switched to much higher ratios of vegetable glycerin with no issues at all.  Definitely have much greater lung function since Ive stopped smoking real cigs I can actually wake up in the morning with clear lungs and not hack out giant brown phlegmballs and make it up  flights of stairs without losing my breath.  If there is some hidden long term danger to my lungs from my ecig then its doing a pretty good job of staying hidden unlike when I was actually smoking.,science,d9oxa11,1,t5_mouw

Even with a supercurrent i.e. current without any resistance the spin doesnt matter.But our memory storage almost exclusively uses this spin information it forms the basis of magnets! To be a little reductionist electron spins come in two types up and down   and   and when we record data in hard drives we have sections domains where there are enough electrons with all their spins aligned that we can easily distinguish between up and down between  and .Whats been done in this article is that they created a method for reliably creating short wires which  carry current without resistance and  record spin information in that current. Its an advancement in the area known as spintronics which is essentially trying to make computers fastermore efficientbetter by using spin information rather than current amperes.

9641271,0,t1_da18gx8,Im really wondering where you get these numbers because they wildly disagree with the CDC Not claiming youre making them up or anything because its wrong in both directions.gt Also there are  deaths by gun violence in US per year. Many are suicidesThere are roughly k homicides yearly and around k suicides with a firearm. Thats where the often quoted  a year comes from.gt another large bulk is adolescent accidental deathThis statement is wildly inaccurate  in  Page   in  Page  similar numbers in past years. And thats ALL accidental firearm discharge deaths not just gt or even adolescents. gt GUNS ARE  KILLER lt yrs of ageLets look at under . The CDC doesnt actually break it down by that specific age group but thats ok. Accidental  discharge  of firearms Under  year      Total for  and under Considering both accidental drowning and accidental exposure to smokefire both individually at least double that with JUST their  age groups  and  Im gonna go ahead and say your statement is false. You may be getting it from the fact that unintentional injuries IS the largest single cause of death in that age group and others up to the mid s. But accidents involving a firearm are only a small part of that.When we look at realistic numbers So rounding up lets say theres k homicides and accidental deaths a year and around k suicides. Now put it into context. Its a nation of  million people with around . million deaths a year. Do the math gun violence is nowhere near the national issue its made out to be. Its well publicized yes but not some huge glaring problem especially when its been dropping along with all other violent crime for the past  years.,science,da1hh5g,2,t5_mouw

9642676,0,t1_da1c8qy,Thank you for a great question. We have looked in one way or another at most of not all of what we prefer to call molecular penetration enhancers MPE. Our experience across a broad range of actives concentrations and formulation formats is that there is no universal penetration enhancer. Rather there is an MPE or much more typically a combination of MPEs which we term multiplexed MPEs MMPEs that works best for a given active. And that combination will usually not work nearly as well for a next active.As we cant predict ahead of time which will work best we need to make measurements and we prefer to make lots of measurements so that rather than trying a handful of formulation compositions in our Cascaded Screening approach we might look at a few hundred formulation compositions.,science,da1nq28,3,t5_mouw

I made a detailed critique of it before which Im pasting heregtImagine being an inertial observer in deep space. What happens if the vacuum energy density is integrated over the light horizon radius of the observable universe or more simply over the surface area of the COBE Sphere with a radius of . billion light years? The result is rather startling and can be rearranged such that the gravitational constant can be shown to be a long wavelength consequence of the quantum vacuum rather than a fundamental constant.Meaningless numerology. Even if those numbers did agree right now thatd be mere happenstance the universe is in expansion which means that any relation derived from the radius of the universe in the present is guaranteed not to work in the past or future. Really anybody can find numerical relations that seem startling but it doesnt mean nor imply anything. For example the cosmological constant equals approximately  joulekm. Does this mean anything? No. No it doesnt. Secondly the radius of the observable universe is not . billion light years but rather . billion light years so the numerical relation doesnt even work.gt The constant K is of numerical value unity but with units of Joules.meter for dimensional consistency. To illustrate the significance of this finding the equation can be rearranged as follows K omitted for clarity All of this work is meant to illustrate the point that two physical constants the gravitational constant G and the quantum mechanics physical constant h can both be shown to have a common mathematicalfundamental relationship to dark energy or the quantum vacuum. Emphases addedNo joke I actually typed the thing about dark energy being approximately  joule per cubic km before I read this passage. I didnt expect hed literally use this very fact mere sentences later with a straight face.gta sea of electron and positron pairs that pop into and out of existence as they spontaneously create and annihilate otherwise known as the quantum vacuum. The myth that will not die. The vacuum is the vacuum dude. By definition it is the eigenstate of particle number with number zero i.e. there are no particles or antiparticles in it ever.gtInterestingly the Dirac Sea approach an earlier vacuum model predicted the existence of the electrons antiparticle the positron in . Not sure what this has to do with anything but the Dirac sea approach has been shown to be fundamentally wrongheaded though it remains a useful analogy in certain contexts.gt  The Casimir force was first predicted by Casimir in  when he realized that as two parallel uncharged metal plates are moved closer together they only allow virtual photons of appropriate integer wavelength that fit within the gap between the plates.There are no virtual photons involved in the Casimir effect. The name virtual particle refers to internal lines in Feynman diagrams which are a visual aid for computing perturbation theory expansions of scattering amplitudes and other useful quantities. These lines have properties in common with real particles eigenstates of particle number and have become to be known as virtual particles by analogy.In contrast most calculations of the Casimir effect are not perturbative at all and what is being computed is simply the effect of the boundary conditions imposed by the plates on the zeropoint energy. This can be done directly by looking at the Hamiltonian of the theory i.e. the expression that defines the theory in terms of the local energy density. You can even use the free theory for this which makes the calculations very very simple and no virtual particles are ever in sight.gtA historical conventional analog to the idea behind the Casimir Force can be drawn considering training given to sailors of the tallship era who were instructed to not allow two ships to get too close to one another in choppy seas lest they be forced together by the surrounding waves requiring assistance to be pulled apart.Yeah no. The pressure due to the vacuum outside the plates is zero and inside the plates it is actually negative. Its the opposite of what were accustomed to think its not that the vacuum outside the plates pushes on them the vacuum inside literally sucks them in. This is not true in general the Casimir force for a sphere is repulsive that is it tends to inflate the sphere. Unexplainable in the boat model.gt So if the vacuum is never really empty and the dominant density contribution to the quantum vacuum arises from the electrodynamic force could the quantum vacuum be treated as a virtual plasma made up of electron positron ep pairs and as such have the tools of Magnetohydrodynamics MHD used to model it? If so then an apparatus could be engineered that could act on the virtual plasma and use it as a propellant. No. Your typical plasma is made of particles and these particles have a rest frame. If you were immersed in such a plasma you could take a few particles and toss them out the back of your spacecraft generating thrust. But youre in a vacuum and the vacuum is Lorentzinvariant. The medium can carry no momentum by itself since it looks the same in every reference frame. If you want to impart momentum to your spacecraft you must create particles and toss them out the back. In other words the only realizable version of this vacuum propulsion is a flashlight. gt The radius of the hydrogen atom nucleus is given as R.xm. The radius can be used with the mass of a proton to calculate a quasiclassical density of the hydrogen nucleus. Calculate equivalent local vacuum fluctuation density as a function of local matter density present using the dark energy density value v  .x kgm. The next step is to determine the volume of this vacuum energy density necessary to sum to the hydrogen ground state of .eV .x Nm. To the point what is the radius of the bubble of encapsulated vacuum energy density? The calculated or predicted radius is r  .xm which turns out to be an exact match to the given value for the Bohr Radius a  .xm. In the process of checking the validity of the equation we have just derived the Bohr radius as a consequence of cosmological dark energy and that the dark energy fraction should be exactly  in lieu of the .  . Readers familiar with the history of the development of quantum mechanics will recognize the profound implications of the above findings.More meaningless numerology. The radius of the atom is a function of the mass of the electron not the proton. This is not just the quantum mechanical prediction mind you you can make an atom with a muon the electrons heavier cousin and its radius is smaller just as predicted. This is what makes muon catalyzed fusion work for instance. Readers with even passing familiarity with QM would be thoroughly unimpressed.gt This same methodology can be applied to dark matter models for galaxies to see if there is a similar correlation when treating dark matter as a virtual ep plasma.It was a matter of time until he said this illdefined thing can explain dark matter and dark energy really.gt Although galactic halo magnetic field strength and structureis not fully understood the predictions can still be compared to the data and models available.What predictions?gtFigure . Galactic Halo Magnetic FieldAhhh the log scale. An excellent tool for making orderofmagnitude disparate quantities seem related. Not that I know what these quantities are anyway.gt The quantum vacuum is continuous but has different density depending on multiple input parameters just discussed one being the density of conventional matter such as the copper walls of a resonator unit. As the momentum information moves through this barrier the density of the quantum vacuumwithin the copper walls is many orders of magnitude less than the squeezed state inside the enclosed region meaning any momentum information lost through a collision process with the copper lattice is many orders of magnitude less than the total momentum information gained by the source of the electric and magnetic fields the copper thrust chamber. This means the departing momentum information will have a long range effect as the quantum vacuum field carrying this information is very weakly interacting with conventional matter due to the very low quantum vacuum densities. This is why we still feel gravity even though we put a thick plate of steel between us and the earth. A gravity well is a hydrostatic pressure gradient in the quantum vacuum while a QVPT is ahydrodynamic pressure gradient in the quantum vacuum.What? No seriously what?

If you look at ultrasounds you will often see one twin pretty much on top of the other in awkward positions which can lead to blood flow being cut off.One thing to think about is that the average child is .lbs at birth but their overall surface area and volume may be smaller than twins. In comparison twins are likely to be .lbs at birth. Fraternal twins will have their own amniotic sac in addition to the mass and volume of the babies in the womb.

9878950,0,t1_dav8pla,I agree that csections are significantly more common now and there may be a better explanation for the trend they found. The authors arent even claiming it is causal  they just posit it as one possibility they considered. But I also agree that over a long enough timeline we may see a real impact. Certainly as you point out medical interventions are getting more and more impressive and this does mean more and more people carry alleles for conditions that would have been selected against in the past.Also this is clearly a population level frequency shift. Women in rural areas of developing nations are not likely getting cesarean sections. Some of the media hype about this is overblown and talking as if it is a change to all humans. Part of the reason Ive been responding is that there is a lot of confusion about what the authors are actually claiming vs what the media is reporting. And just general misunderstandings of existing ideas in the field that this article is speaking to.

Some scientists believe CTE Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy was a cause or at the very least a contributing factor to the tragedy. CTE is a degenerative brain injury caused by massive andor repeated blows to the head. It was originally known as being punchdrunk because mostly boxers were found to have the injury but its becoming an increasingly common finding in the brains of NFL players and professional wrestlers like Benoit. ,science,dazuo3f,1,t5_mouw

9924552,0,t1_db16q91,We dont believe single journal articles. Few have in medicine for  years or more. I recall my training dept. head who told us that in !!  Those articlesfindings must be confirmed  times and as so few are even confirmable we just sort of ignore those which dont fit anything in our experience knowledge of pathophysiology. First thing we ask is does this article make any sense? And then is it confirmed? and of course mostly is it published at all!!!the state of scientific amp medical publishing is dreadfully a mess and not getting any better. We dont even use new drugs OKd by the FDA very much until  years have passed. Those who do are too quick out of the starting gate quickly find themselves in the losers circles.The only exception to that is if our colleagues in Eurozone or Canada and Mexico have a LOT of experience with such a drug and we know its problems indications and extensive experiences from them.Essentially pharma is barely out of the folk medicine era now and the rest of the sciences are regressing a lot too. We believe it IFF it works and works clearly such that a child could almost tell the treatment of whatever type works. otherwise given the costs of new meds we simply ignore it so our patients dont get hurt or sue or worse.  knew a physician who got his clinic blown up by disgruntled persons!! That is the state of things since Bush the father with the FDA. No one for  years in the USA has fixed this drug problem at all. its disgraceful.The NEJM had an article in Dec.  about creating an independent drug review board to greatly reduce this FDA problem. So far nothing has been done. Its that bad.The people know these facts. This is why the Donald won. He knew the leadership of this nation from the top down is very very corrupt and negligent and arrogantly dismissive of anything useful and valued. Now it gets shaken up. Sadly it had to take this long. but corrupt leadership amp dictatorships only change when too many die. Thats whats happening now on many many levels.Interestingly enough Obama actually created the conditions which weakened the leadership paving the way for Trumps strong man solutions and win. how could a single man opposed by the TWO bush Presidencies the clinton presidency and the sitting President literally the entire media AND big business and defeat them all soundly besides!!  Our forefathers built well this structure here. The stocks are up  points since  Nov. This is not a coincidence. perhaps things will get better.

In this study we designed a modular ensemble of  deep neural networks DNNs of varying depth structure and optimization to predict human chronological age using a basic blood test. To train the DNNs we used over  samples from common blood biochemistry and cell count tests from routine health exams performed by a single laboratory and linked to chronological age and sex. The best performing DNN in the ensemble demonstrated .  epsilonaccuracy r  . with R  . and MAE  . years in predicting chronological age within a  year frame while the entire ensemble achieved . epsilonaccuracy r  . with R  . and MAE  . years. The ensemble also identified the  most important markers for predicting human chronological age albumin glucose alkaline phosphatase urea and erythrocytes. To allow for public testing and evaluate reallife performance of the predictor we developed an online system available at  The ensemble approach may facilitate integration of multimodal data linked to chronological age and sex that may lead to simple minimally invasive and affordable methods of tracking integrated biomarkers of aging in humans and performing crossspecies feature importance analysis.,science,db260b5,2,t5_mouw

As you suggest attrition bias is a big deal in psychiatric research and how you treat dropouts in the statistical analysis can totally change your conclusions. In the end if you want good data from a large sample you either find a big metareview or hope NIMH will fund another giant study.The nice thing about clinical research though is that you dont always need tremendous statistical power because small statistical differences usually arent clinically significant. Lets pretend we had a gigantic n and solidly determined that paroxetinetherapy gave a remission rate of  versus  for therapy alone. For adding paroxetine thats a number needed to treat of  to get one patient to remit. For any individual patient thats a trivial difference compared to things like cost time and side effects. On the flip side lets say we were only adequately powered to detect a  difference and failed to find it. We havent proved them identical but weve suggested theyre close enough that we wouldnt care about further differences.Alone this study cant tell us much about the relative effect sizes since the confidence intervals are pretty big but its a worthy addition and consistent with NICE guidelines that recommend targeted therapy alone as the firstline treatment for social anxiety disorder.,science,dbb7epc,1,t5_mouw

I can remember being in the depths of depression and jumping from platform to platform because everyone else didnt update fast enough or regularly enough at am. So while my overall social media use wasnt huge in the early hours you might even sign up to new platforms and poke around and hope to see something comforting reaffirming or reinforcing. ,science,dbft757,1,t5_mouw

10041388,0,t1_dbgdvc3,It would be impossible to push any nation into using antimatter for weapons. There isnt enough money in the United States to create enough antimatter to rival a single bomb. Creating a gram of antimatter would cost tens of trillions of dollars with our current level of technology and that figure wont be any better in the foreseeable future. Of course its always possible that some miraculous eureka invention would allow for efficient manufacturing of antimatter but if that were to happen there is no way it would be used for weapons such a device would be the jewel of mankind and under the careful watch of the entire world. The appeal of antimatter weapons isnt about creating a bigger bomb  we already have nuclear weapons that can cleanse the Earth of mankind. Antimatters potential as a weapon comes from its ability to unleash all of the energy stored within its particles all at once so you could theoretically make a mm bullet that can destroy a truck.Antimatter annihilates itself and the thing it touches. The particles within the atoms of matter and antimatter are perfect opposites of each other the moment they touch they instantly unleash their energy. If you were hit with all of the antimatter that we have produced to date youd probably get a very severe burn as well as a radiation burn.CERN is definitely generating more questions but science is limitless and the more answers you get the more questions you can ask. We create a theory gt we test the theory gt we prove the theory gt we start to wonder what else is possible within the theory gt we create a new theory.

Youve been told that food  love that you give soup to people when they are sick casseroles to people who have had loved ones pass away that food is the way to a mans heart. I think in some way it helps to mitigate some of the helplessness that people feel when seeing a loved one deteriorate. Ive seen people estranged from their family suddenly take a keen interest in the care of their sick parent and it may be guilt in those cases better late than never right? but I dont think you can assume that people who fuss are automatically guilty in some way or are abusive.

Is your vision that we will take advantage of highly parallelized nanopore sequencers such as those being developed at Oxford Nanopore? When do you envision these technologies will hit the market with significant coverage?I also wonder if its necessary to do whole genome sequencing  if a fingerprint was sufficient previously could say  sequence reads be enough to generate a speciesspecific genetic fingerprint that can be compared to a database of known sequences? How easy do you expect it will be to definitively rule out the sequence reads that are being generated from belonging to environmental nonpathogenic bacteria phage the food source itself etc? Will sequences from these associated species also be saved and categorized?Thanks again!,science,dc8vwn5,2,t5_mouw

We have to spend  figures to learn how to fix these analyzers not to mention parts. After we get everything going and the sales team gets us contracts we find out the manufacturer discontinues part X so we have to go online and pray. Weve bought broken machines on eBay before just to cannibalize for parts. Service can be expensive but its mostly to cover the cost and not to get rich.

10304826,0,t1_dcbwvha,Reading the VCSEL wikipedia article makes some sense of it. The paper behind this BICSEL development makes reference to the fact that VCSELs are the current stateoftheart for embedded lasers such as in optical fiber transmission.Instead of generating a specific wavelength of light using a gas or doped crystalline VCSELs use distributed Bragg reflectors to restrict the generated wavelength of light to a specific range. In short you pump electricity across this component and one of its edges shoots out a highlycoherent laser beam.BICSELs seem to advance on VCSELs by being composed of a structure of cylinders that can be deposited on a D plane instead of requiring many layers deposited on top of each other as in the case of VCSELs. However the linked article seems to obscure a key problem in BICSELs right now  they dont pump their own light. They are optically powered instead of electrically powered whereas VCSELs are inherently electrically powered. This is a huge complication requiring a separate lightemitting component to make them work.,science,dcc3vit,17,t5_mouw

The definition of a causal relationship is one in which you know which direction the of the causation. If youre aware that two variables are correlated but are unsure of the direction of causality or uncertain if theres another confounding variable that explains the relationship then the relationship is considered correlational not causal.gtI dont mean to semantically pick this apart but it seems like there is too much room for error from one study performed in the manner you describe it is my thought that you would have to approach the problem from multiple directions in order to isolate and define the variables and the objects they affect and then to identify the type of relationship the direction of causality.Oh there is this is why there would ideally be replication studies and followup studies. But keep in mind researchers do often account for many different variables when performing research. Youre correct that one single study cannot determine definitively whether there is a causal relationship between two variables but the original question I responded to asked more generally how causality is determined in psychology not how science determines some sort of ultimate truth.,science,dcguh7v,10,t5_mouw

10449888,0,t1_dcsh10b,There was a really interesting study not this one that suggested seeing more conspiracy theories may actually encourage you to believe more. It was a simple network analysis type study so it is limited in what it really tells us. But they looked at people on FB who shared a conspiracy theory here defined as belief in a conspiracy that does not seem to have reputable supporting evidence and how their engagement with other conspiracy theories broadened the longer they were engaging with those networks. People usually start out with just one vaccines cause autism climate change isnt real evolution is a lie etc. Sharing them with their FB feeds often means a positive feedback loop. This is especially true if they find a FB group dedicated to the topic. But within that feedback loop are people who also hold onto other conspiracies. They share their ideas and you like them perhaps just to be nice. But now more and more conspiracy theories will show up on your feed because thats how the algorithm works. Eventually people who started out invested in just one conspiracy broaden to liking and sharing conspiracies across all four categories health environment diet and geopolitics. So in your example that would be like coming into a music group a fan of Miles Davis. And after spending significant time there you may still have a deep love for The Prince of Darkness but your tastes will expand not only to other jazz greats but also folk classical and the blues. Engaging with other music lovers opens your eyes ears? to genres you otherwise would not have paid attention to and you begin to appreciate it. Even if it isnt your favorite music you may find yourself enjoying Woody Guthrie and talking about the politics of his music. And even sharing some of his songs on social media. Because thats what engaging in a deeply invested music group can do. ,science,dcslayx,2,t5_mouw

10457156,0,t1_dctefcn,I have read that. From the pagegtDetection does not imply attribution of the detected change to the assumed cause. Attribution of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence see Glossary. As noted in the SAR IPCC  and the TAR IPCC  unequivocal attribution would require controlled experimentation with the climate system. Since that is not possible in practice attribution of anthropogenic climate change is understood to mean demonstration that a detected change is consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing and not consistent with alternative physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings IPCC .The page itself reiterates all Ive said as its making determinations based on the most likely correlation based on observations of the earth itself in past occurrences andgtunequivocal attribution would require controlled experimentation with the climate system.So its the best thats possible but not unequivocal proof. Perhaps I am being as rigid as I am on semantics in retaliation to all of the hyperbole I have witnessed in science journalism. I agree with the intent of those that make wild statements about climate science to try to convince so called deniers the name itself is condescending and counterproductive to education but I disagree intensely with their methods.

Especially with persecution  delusions of grandeur its pretty common to start assigning religious reasoning.Dont mistake me  Im not saying that religious people are crazy. People with inwardlyfocused issues often look to whatever framework has been presented that can give them meaning or structure. It just goes to show that religion is a deeply archetypal source of meaning for our lives and when someone is desperate and their mind needs some external source to focus on they may turn to religion depending on their background.EDIT your point still stands.

10482481,0,t3_5q4vtr,Original source journal articleNicotine reverses hypofrontality in animal models of addiction and schizophreniaNature Medicine  doi.nm.Received  October  Accepted  December  Published online  January Abstractgt The prefrontal cortex PFC underlies higher cognitive processes that are modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR activation by cholinergic inputs. PFC spontaneous default activity is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophreniaa disorder that can be accompanied by heavy smoking. Recently genomewide association studies GWAS identified singlenucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in the human CHRNA gene encoding the  nAChR subunit that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia . Mice with altered nAChR gene function exhibit PFCdependent behavioral deficits   but it is unknown how the corresponding human polymorphisms alter the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying behavior. Here we show that mice expressing a human  SNP exhibit neurocognitive behavioral deficits in social interaction and sensorimotor gating tasks. Twophoton calcium imaging in awake mouse models showed that nicotine can differentially influence PFC pyramidal cell activity by nAChR modulation of layer IIIII hierarchical inhibitory circuits. In SNPexpressing and knockout mice lower activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide VIP interneurons resulted in an increased somatostatin SOM interneuron inhibitory drive over layer IIIII pyramidal neurons. The decreased activity observed in SNPexpressing mice resembles the hypofrontality observed in patients with psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and addiction . Chronic nicotine administration reversed this hypofrontality suggesting that administration of nicotine may represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia and a physiological basis for the tendency of patients with schizophrenia to selfmedicate by smoking.,science,dcwapwl,1,t5_mouw

As say a larch from northern California has much different DNA specific to those climates than a larch from southern British Columbia. So in order to move a tree species up in latitude or elevation they select the seed stock from the highest elevation and most northern fringes to gradually work the species further north and higher in elevation as they have the highest chance of survival in those temporary extremes.As well I believe it is assumed that any insects and birds that these trees will depend on  be resistant to will follow the change in climate much faster than the trees would be able to we are just helping the trees move faster.,science,dcycrda,1,t5_mouw

10510680,0,t3_5qh64v,Im pretty sure this is correlation and not causation. Obviously drug use is associated with other events like being poor and being exposed to more crime. Typically the younger a child is the more the other factors like crime and poverty have to play a part to expose that child to drugs to the point that theyd try them. The older they get the more exposed to drugs they are naturally so the more likely they are to try drugs like marijuana free of the other adverse conditions again like poverty.

10516154,0,t1_dd03igj,Okay sodium channels are probably the main excitatory ion channel in the brain. What happens is glutamate or any other excitatory neurotransmitter will hit the NMDA or any other excitatory receptor and this causes depolarization activation of the neuron.Sodium channels are triggered and this causes the excitatory signal to be  transferred. Sodium channel activation eventually leads to calcium channel activation which causes neurons to grow generally through calciums effect on cytoskeletons LTP mitosis ect and this helps create memory and connections between neurons.In autism and epilepsy there seems to be excess excitatory activity. No two cases are the same though. Some people have autism because they have reduced GABA main inhibitory neurotransmitter  directly opposes glutamate some people have autism from too much glutamate ect the result is the same  excess excitation. Many times this is genetic someone has a broken genes that control inhibitory tone in the brain. Others might have excess oxidative stress and this could cause loss of regulation in the brain. When theres loss of regulation shit starts breaking if theres loss of regulation than excitatory tone is not controlled properly.What happens in epilepsy is what is called runaway excitation basically excitatory signals create more excitation creates a positive feedback loop which ends up causing the brain to be frozen with pure excitation and once this reaches a certain threshold the person will have a seizure.Im not sure why some people are epileptics and some people are autistic. A lot of times people have both but I wonder why sometimes people only have one or the other  probably their specific genes and environment creating a unique excitatory dysfunction. For example maybe epileptics have less GABA and autistic people have more glutamate  both have excess excitation but its expressed in different ways those are just examples not real.Having higher sodium channels basically increases excitation and this leads to more connections between neurons generally. In some people this can lead to better memory and intelligence. But in people with too much excitation  like some severe autistic people have  the benefits will cancel out as neurons will be killed from too much calcium influx and this will have a net negative effect on their intelligence. Having a good amount of inhibition in the brain is also helpful for thinking though. Your brain must be in balance for accurate calculations to be made. The reason things like medical marijuana ketogenic diets or various inhibitory drugs like gabapentin or benzodiazepines help treat epilepsy and autism is because they reduce excitation and bring balance to the brain.Hope that helped I tried to make it comprehensive. ,science,dd04ak9,5,t5_mouw

The distribution of the eggs in the horseshoe crab is leftright symmetrical not just on the one side like with the trilobite. It suggests that they were placed there by another organism to me.

I often wake up because hes snoring loudly taking up too much space etc. When I sleep in my own bed my sleep is very good there are no distractions like a TV but I also tend to sleep for way too long because nothing is waking me up.

10713136,0,t1_ddkrgr1,In my opinion you get the best results with rotational grazing. Grasses grow faster and build top soil faster than forests. Forests are incredibly slow at building soil. They build great soil they are very stable they hold more water in the soil they do more for the ecosystem as a whole and they stabilize hillsides better than grasses but in terms of getting carbon into the soil they are slow. Depending on where you live you can graze up to  or  cycles a year on grassland.The soil that makes up the corn belt was built by bison and other ruminants during the post ice age period. It was ten feet deep in some places. Rotational grazing that is planned by farmers and moderated with electric fencing can be even faster and more effective than ruminants that are just chasing grass and avoiding wolves.This requires active management though so you might need to look into a local farmer who is doing grassfed beef or lamb and see if he wants to team up.,science,ddkzad3,8,t5_mouw

10735189,0,t1_ddn3xud,gtSo is this preserved DNA technical sufficient to clone the animal?Short answer NopeLong answerWe cant do it yet. The problem with current technology is that you basically need a viable nucleus to transplant into a host cell. There is effectively a  chance that this specimen contains any viable nuclei. What it will contain is a lot of fragmented and damaged pieces of DNA and protein. In order to clone this turtle wed need to be able to accurately sequence its DNA possible but depends on exactly how good the preservation is assemble the genome in silico possible but very difficult to assemble completely using short ancient fragments synthesise artificial chromosomes based on the reassembled genome as far as I know we cant currently do this apply any epigenetic modifications that criticial for gene expression were struggling to even read these from ancient specimens let alone replicate them on an artificial chromosomes and repackage the DNA probably possible using enzymes from a related species. This is also why we dont have cloned mammoths or any other species that has been extinct for an appreciable amount of time. We cant even clone a thylacine for this reason and theve only been extinct  years.gtIf it was what are the ethical reasons to not go ahead with it if any?There is a lot of discussion about this that you will find if you google deextinction. Briefly though one argument that has been made is that its unethical to bring back a species purely for it to live in captivity. Many candidates for deextinction have no habitat to go back to or would be dangerous to humans if they were returned to their habitat.,science,ddn95s3,2,t5_mouw

The crossbreds they had do u remember if the crossbreds are sterile? Did the crossbreds form a basis for an entirely new species that can keep multiplying on its own. This would require the crossbreds to actively seek out each other I presume.Hmmm interesting.I wouldnt worry about the concept of micro and macro being universally accepted within our scientific community. So many things we talk about arent especially in the area of evolution. Some hot debates have taken place between scientists on this topic. Im still learning and trying not to be a dogmatic.

Its also alarming that in a discussion of people rising to power through the subjugation of others your first instinct is to refer to them as successful. Just because you cant see certain systems of oppression dont mean they dont exist. Its quite telling that once a scientific eye is turned to human behavior it suddenly becomes convenient to wax philosophically about humans who are simply failures.

I would also make it an international crime to fail to properly care for those affected by disasters.

That fact that there may be asymmetric gene expression in the brain even though they show that is much lower than in the spine is almost irrelevant since we can see lateralisation before the motor cortex is part of the equation.,science,ddz2gi2,5,t5_mouw

10856616,0,t1_ddzpht3,gtIf both sets of numbers are close to true and have a hypothetical causal relationship it means gays are significantly overrepresented in suicide statistics almost all gays attempt suicide and further that almost every gay suicide is related to marriage legality. Well some of this is demonstrably true at least based on existing evidence but its more a question of proportionality rather than raw numbers and it seems like youre touching upon the latter?. For instance LGBTQ youth are nearly  times more likely to attempt suicide when compared to straight youth. Suicide attempt rates hover roughly around  for LGB youth and  for transgender youth according to the Williams Institute.Note about the final cited source I didnt want to link to the Williams PDF directly and the article has more information if youre interested.As for the point about it being related to marriage equality you might find this interesting.,science,ddzs7jl,2,t5_mouw

10892215,0,t1_de2umts,We have two methods of searching for and finding life in our galaxy.The first is that we look for exoplanets that may harbor conditions similar to what we know supports life the other is that we send radiowaves out into the cosmos.The first approach is problematic because life could exist outside of what were looking for our instruments exclude a subset of potential candidates and it takes many man hours to comb over and study the data or to write the programs to do it.  And if we do find life our current technology means nothing we make can visit there inside of hundreds of years.The second approach is problematic because it assumes intelligent life other than us has a use for radio waves and the waves are directional.What we really need is a different approach.  I dont know how long this would take but I imagine it would be faster than even sending a probe to our nearest solar neighbor but we need a way to blot out the sun.  Imagine a large  very large!  array of solar powered panels held into relative position by magnetism.  Then through the power of magic the panels can tilt or rotate to either allow all of some of or none of the suns light through.  Well that ladies and gentlemen is a giant beacon.

Yes that means the average person may pay slightly more for food but thats not a problem because the pay is greater the welfare is better etc. In total though the effect is positive. People who eat healthier need less healthcare and are more efficient workers.My country does help poor people eat better by paying them better. We also have more unions greater regulation on how much theyre allowed to work and a lower overtime line. This means that even poor people should generally work similar amounts to others and still get paid better than they would in America for example. Since people have more time off most families actually make homemade meals. Eating out is expensive too and since the food regulation is really good and healthy foods are pretty cheap you can make a lot of good stuff at home.I agree that businesses should give employees a greater share of profits in the United States. That takes regulation and America continually rejects regulations that would help the poor and lower middle class most. Americans vote against their own interests because of their political views.Making unhealthy foods more expensive encourages people not just the poor to eat healthier. And those healthy foods we want them to eat are not taxed. It means that eating some dried beans bread rice vegetables etc. would be cheaper than eating a McDonalds meal. This is good for their quality of life as well. It also encourages food makers to create healthier foods as they are more economically viable. And of course it also means that junk food like candy is heavily taxed. So when it comes to pleasure eating and snacking people are less likely to eat candy.Governments do try to sway your decision making through taxation. Why is this controversial? The fact that its cheaper to make deep fried chicken wings than it is to farm kale and celery is completely arbitrary. With regulation and taxation you can make healthier foods relatively cheaper and cheaper than if there were no such taxation and regulation. Can you explain why this is a bad thing? Theyre not stopping you from eating unhealthy theyre just making it an uneconomical choice one that is not primarily motivated by the badforyou food being cheaper.Im Norwegian editing this as I realized I never mentioned and you may be curious. Its far from a Utopia and we have our societal problems but I dont know anyone who isnt happy with the regulation and tax around food. Its has such a positive effect on health and happiness. To see that many Americans are against this kind of government involvement is unfortunate.,science,de96bq8,1,t5_mouw

Every condition is separate and could be attributed to the referrals or the area you live in not having properly trained clinicians.Its like surgeons some are more equipped than others to utilize techniques and some are more competent better skilled than others.Some take their jobs seriously some dont I have no idea why there clinicians you saw were it successful with you there are probably several reasons for it that I wouldnt be able to help you understand without context but Im telling you that depression is not black and white sometimes its a chemical imbalance sometimes its a compilation of issues or even issues that occurred in childhood it could be other issues you are struggling with that are compounding depression the point is that these techniques without professional guidance may be good for people with mild depression as a stopgap measure or who are simply in a temporary funk but without proper guidance relapse is much more likely.

10965283,0,t1_deayt93,Thank you for your explanation this is the best and clearest reply to the questions Ive been wondering about.  Im aware that Im pretty ignorant on the topic which is why I try to listen to a lot of the arguments Ive heard and try to understand where the other side was coming from but the people I talked to definitely couldnt put it in the scientific terms that make it clear.  I wasnt aware research had shown that autism is so linked to genetic markers or that there were indicators for a fetus having been exposed to the controversy around things like testing for Downs syndrome or the bioethics of abortingbirthing anencephalic babies I can see the huge implications but the stance makes perfect sense now.  Edit All that said I still believe there are merits to the other side of the discussion from family members who passionately advocate for their loved ones who are not high functioning enough to be able to argue about labels dive into the politics of whether they want to be called an Autistic person or a person with autism  advocate for themselves etc.  There still seems to be a huge split within the autism community I think part of that is those who are able to advocate for themselves are not very good advocates for the autistic people who cannot  perhaps the seeming lack of compassion  maybe a lack of ability to perceive the split between identifying oneself as specialAutism is a gift vs seeing the very real struggles and pains of some others  is an inherent consequence of autism itself.  Perhaps it is more difficult to escape from blackwhite views of oneself and others or to acknowledge that not everyones experience is your experience.Anyway your response has been enlightening and I hope I didnt offend you or anyone with my questions and observations.  Hopefully there are others with similar ideas who will see your comment.  ,science,deazplb,2,t5_mouw

10992407,0,t3_5wz4i7,Study Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic OceangtAbstractgtThe uptake of anthropogenic CO by the ocean decreases seawater pH and carbonate mineral aragonite saturation state arag a process known as Ocean Acidification OA. This can be detrimental to marine organisms and ecosystems. The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change and aragonite is expected to become undersaturated arag lt  there sooner than in other oceans. However the extent and expansion rate of OA in this region are still unknown. Here we show that between the s and  low arag waters have expanded northwards at least  to  N and deepened  m to  m depth. Data from transwestern Arctic Ocean cruises show that arag lt  water has increased in the upper  m from  to  of the total area north of  N. Tracer data and model simulations suggest that increased Pacific Winter Water transport driven by an anomalous circulation pattern and seaice retreat is primarily responsible for the expansion although local carbon recycling and anthropogenic CO uptake have also contributed. These results indicate more rapid acidification is occurring in the Arctic Ocean than the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with the western Arctic Ocean the first openocean region with largescale expansion of acidified water directly observed in the upper water column.,science,dedydh6,5,t5_mouw

Inbreeding would be likely in the new mammoths though if a stable population is the goal youd be starting off with likely a small number of genetically distinct individuals.Im assuming there arent thousands of mammoth genomes sequenced.However we need not be limited to natural sequences. While no one has ever studied functional genetics in mammoths a lot of genes and sequences will likely be pretty similar to sequences weve observed in existing healthy animals and can predict whether there are harmful mutations in the sequences from the siberian samples.To bring a mammoth back will likely require another technology discussed by the group talking about bringing mammoths back synthesizing whole genomes from scratch. So wed be able in theory to make changes to the genome and introduce artificial variation into the cloned mammoths. Inbreeding is associated with problems because youre more likely to get two nonfunctional copies of a gene if those bad versions exist in the population.If you are able to identify nonfunctional versions of the gene and dont synthesize genomes with those nonfunctional versions of the genes in them then there actually wont be any problems in inbreeding. There are completely inbred populations lab mice for example where every single animal is genetically identical aside from sex chromosomes obviously. There are no recessive alleles in these populations. Sibling mice breeding with each other doesnt cause any problems because there are no recessive alleles to uncover.If the mammoth population has no recessive alleles inbreeding will occour but not the problems associated with it.Of course these are big ifs but so is the whole mammoth plan.,science,deh9qv8,2,t5_mouw

The only limitation being that you cant safely use strands like AAAAAAAAAAA or CCCCCCCCC etc. We already have random bits of garbled noncoding DNA in our cells IIRC at the end of our chromosomes to delay the deterioration of actual useful DNA strands.

Drug targeting in chemotherapy has been studied a lot. It can be considered nanotechnology because of size. But essentially it revolves around finding a receptor that is unique to cancer cells and then finding a molecule that will bee line it to the receptor! If we find a receptorligand combo that is unique to all and only cancer cells we could have a revolutionary drug on our hands but it is very difficult to do! The other application to cancer is illuminating MRI contrasting agent like they mentioned. This is where nanopartlicles come into play. As for the active drug targeting is more of a bio molecular problem than a nano technology one. So far ,science,demqz7z,1,t5_mouw

If you consider coal power safe then you are okay with coal producing more airborne radioactive particles than nuclear. Along with everything else it does produce also. Where in nuclear your byproducts are non airborne rad particles and water vapor. Coal has and will cause more cancer than nuclear always. Even with these horrible disasters that occur a safely operated coal plant causes more harm than all those disasters.While I feel that solar and wind are great. Solar has its issues to with efficiency. We would have to cover a immensely large area to be able to produce enough power for one city of  million. And also the same issue with wind. Solar power also requires rare earth minerals which cause about the same environmental harm I would assume. Nuclear is the safer and efficient source of energy.

Alcohol is a driving factor in  of robberies  of sexual assaults  of aggravated assaults  of domestic violence incidents and  of homicides.So the real question is do you follow your own logic and advocate the return of Prohibition?After that we also have to deal with the fact that there are many many alcoholics and hardcore drug addicts that dont break the law otherwise or pose a threat to anyone but themselves. Not every coke addict steals or robs. How is it okay to lock every individual up because the group they are in has a disproportionately high rate of crime? Whats next locking up every young poor black male because they have a disproportionately high rate of crime?Wouldnt it be better to simply let people do what they do then if they actually rob someone arrest them for that?gt Or resort to sexual favors in exchange for cash or drugs.If there was ever an industry that would benefit from legalization as much as marijuana would prostitution would be it.,science,deqryk9,6,t5_mouw

11107385,0,t1_deqzd1w,It is a super contentious topic when you come to the evolution of emotions however the most widely accepted explanation is they are highly derived basic instincts for survival in groups and that is why species such a monkeys and other social mammals seem to display such emotions. In that sense all humans would share these tendencies as they are based on traits that evolved in animals long long ago. Homo neanderthalensis came out of Africa branching from Homo erectus around  thousand years ago so by this point such emotions would likely already have been well established. The paper is saying they found genes that are associated with lighter skin bloodrelated diseases and greater biological capacity for depression are more common in Neanderthal DNA so yes it is that they evolved a greater tendency for these traits rather than establishing the traits themselves.Interestingly if no subsequent tendency towards these traits has been made by nonNeanderthal lineages since they would probably be less prone to immunology related diseases and depression. Of course with easier travel in the modern age hopefully the tendency of these negative traits could be lessened with global movement dependent on the dominantrecessive nature of the genetics.,science,der0gg8,1,t5_mouw

11144460,0,t1_dev6t8o,Can I offer my two cents as a trans man? I think the idea of transgender would probably still exist even if tomorrow men and women were treated completely equal and gender norms and stereotypes were abolished. While yes in todays world I couldve probably gotten by pretty decently had I remained an incredibly tomboyish woman but my two big reasons for transitioning was that I constantly wished my body could have the aesthetics of a man sharp jaw muscles flat chest penis short hair etc and that even when we reach near perfect gender equality theres still going to be subtle connotative differences between when a man does something and a woman does something from cooking to ballet to kissing to grocery shopping. Its not necessarily a sexist connotation such as men are better cooks that women or something of that nature but there are subtle details that can be inferred between the two that are likely to be right and personally I feel a different vibe thinking about the way a man is perceived doing things compared to a woman doing those same things and I preferred being seen through the mantinted glasses I suppose.Tldr even if gender norms reduced to a negligible amount something thats unlikely to happen within the next  years imo people would still be transgender and transition because of subtle connotative differences between genders and for the aesthetic of the other sex that wouldve been impossibleincredibly difficult to achieve without the aid of hormones and surgery.,science,dev7o3e,38,t5_mouw

If you are a transman and might be at risk for a heartattack should you look for the female or male symptoms?

11150187,0,t1_devqafv,I mean Im not trying to divide the world neatly between east and west.

I am more or less of the belief that more traditional cultures have in some instances been generally accepted and if not totally normalized at least tolerated in large.But also I really didnt mean to use Western here as a point of contrast. Its more that Im talking about Western civilization because thats the context in question. In Thailand for instance conception of transsexuality is completely different and its more commonaccepted but also these people still face huge problems of their own. How Western civilization comes to view trans people will be in its own terms. More or less the history of transgender people in the modern west begins in like the s and so the phenomenon is still very new to us resulting in it being hotly debated. I imagine that in another  years well generally have more defined terms to refer to different aspects of gendervariant life and while there will be differing outlooks on these individuals it wont strike many as so shocking as it does today.,science,devv14a,3,t5_mouw
11151469,0,t1_devfqcg,Firstly  it sounds like the majority of your issue is with your experiences with men and what you think men are like to young girlswomen rather than the reality. Bathroom sexual assaults or assaults in general are incredibly rare. You also dont need to pass as a female to enter the womans washroom  a man could simply walk in and commit a crime regardless of what he was wearing. Secondly statistically the biggest threat to your daughter is their current or previous romantic partner or a male family memberfriend of the family. The highest rates of sexual abuse happen in the home or in a safe place to the child. If you were really worried about your childs safety and protecting them from sexual predators you would be better off refusing to allow male relatives and friends time alone with her. A large portion of child sexual abuse also occurs from an older sibling experimenting on the younger child so you should also avoid situations where theyre unattended together where this can happen. Thirdly you pretend boys are girls and girls are boys all the time. Unless you know the configuration of the other persons genitals their chromosomes hormone levels etc you have no idea what their sex actually is. Everyone uses social cues like facial hair visible breasts voice pitch mannerisms clothing to determine if someone is male or female. Its why the signs on the door to the washrooms show a person in a dress in a person in pants instead of a vagina and penis  theyre simply symbols to indicate that people who express themselves femininemasculine use that room not whether they were born XX or XY or other. So if you dont know what their genitals look like how do you know theyre really male or female? If youre a woman wearing pants do you still use the washroom that shows the person wearing a dress or the washroom where the figure is wearing pants?Lastly I would recommend reading up on the genital tubercle and how sex characteristics are actually formed in the fetus. Every fetus starts with structures that can develop male female neither absent or a mix of both intersex. The tissues are all the same they just form or arrange themselves differently. Biologically most Ive seen is femalecan become pregnant while malecan inseminate though theres always multitudes of variations on that fish that change gender male seahorses become pregnant birds with  sexes hermaphrodites asexual reproduction etc. ,science,dew09cu,3,t5_mouw

A recent example that we see every day in the hospitals mom slurring her words on the telephone or not coming to the door daughter goes over and finds her on the floor in the throes of a massive stroke. Off to the hospital for treatment even if the damage is done we can likely keep them alive to send them to rehab. From there in rehab if they dont progress then stay long term for years and years usually. If you take the daughter out of the equation mom dies on the floor in the kitchen years before she would have if her daughter hadnt saved her.And even if the daughter doesnt visit her ever in the home thereafter shes still going to live and have her basic needs met by the staff so statistically it does lengthen lives.

I had a woman who drank bleach and was whining she wanted narcotics because she burned her throat her throat wasnt red there was no irritation to the mucosa and she kept yelling at me to get her a dinner tray  based off her yelling the fact she still had a very intact appetite and her mouth looked impeccable she was talking and acting appropriately  why narcotics? I just do my assessment though document as necessary and its the doctors call for narcotics. There are times I tell him I disagree and why  but ultimately if he still wants it given I document concerns with it and give medication as ordered. There are patients who need pain management that I strongly fight for to get narcotics even if they have addiction history. I had a former addict who was hit by a car and had an open fracture. The doctor didnt want to prescribe anything heavier than mg of morphine. Hes still sitting there screaming and in obvious pain  mg to someone who has a tolerance isnt going to work. Eventually over the years you just pick up on these things. ,science,df4dioy,46,t5_mouw

Severe Haze is a classification given to smog levels.For Beijing these affects on weather patterns prevents the smog from being blown or washed away. Beijing isnt near any mountains and no coast is surrounded by mountains on three sides that prevent the smog from easily being carried away. Without the usual weather it just sits there and builds until it hits Severe Haze levels.The equivalent would be your trash collector coming once a month instead of once a week because the roads have too many potholes.EDIT Factual corrections.

You can just put it in a pan with a lid with boiling water and simmer for the amount of time the rice requires  minutes for typical white rice. The idea that you need a specially designed tool for such a simple and nonintensive task that doesnt take much time is strange to me.However if youd like a more scientific justification for not using a rice cooker rice tends to contain heavy metals particularly arsenic. The best way to cook rice to remove the arsenic is to cook it in as much water as possible and discard the water. So cook it in a very large saucepan and instead of letting it absorb the water you cook it until its done and then strain the rice.Rice cookers are the worst way of cooking rice when it comes to retaining the arsenic since all the water is just absorbed into the rice and the arsenic doesnt go anywhere except inside you when you eat it.,science,dfp1coz,1,t5_mouw

These are widely used amongst Autism Centers of Excellence yet very little in other settings. But to proliferate their use would require a huge increase in the number of qualified experts to run these test. Do you think these methodologies are practical as solutions to the high variability in diagnosis quality? Or are other methods yet to be developed a more realistic target for getting more reliable diagnosis for every child? Thank you again!,science,dfwn7va,2,t5_mouw

My daughter curled up on the floor in a ball eyes closed and covered her ears. Her then teacher though she had fallen asleep and left her there but in actuality it was to loud and bright.Clothes are a nightmare often she feels its gone on wrong and will try again and again to get it on right.She hates to be alone shes gotten better. We love near a railway track and often she will refuse to be alone in the bathroom for wees and poops as the trains unexpectedly going past terrifies her.The food was the big issue her refusal to eat at all had her falling off growth charts. Weve done a lot of work to get her on track but she isnt just a fussy eater. Theres more to it. She gags on foods she reacts to food on other peoples plates as if shes being forced to eat it. Shes vomited in school in distress at times due to the stress of being expected to eat things to her seem inedible.Her current teacher is amazing and Im sure we can get to the bottom of it soon.I often feel as she isnt disruptive it is ignored despite its causing harm to her and upsetting her.

Its very possible he could make more accurate predictions by chopping down his samples of the whole population assuming he samples everywhere with equal representation because that greater variability would have included some of that important variability among the the neighborhoods.  However you are correct at the end of the day he made a bad choice because he set his sample population to be everybody in the town.

Stating that there is statistically significant difference in their heights when men are  and women are . is true but really not what we want to know.

11532193,0,t1_dg2hpam,Yes there is some truth to this but there is also some evidence that this is a conditional relationship. Past research has shown that when employees perceive themselves as overqualified they are more likely to search for a new job. Those who are objectively overeducated for their jobs also are likely to change jobs more quickly. Finally there is a positive correlation between perceived overqualification and turnover intentions. This could be because they are bored but also because they have the qualifications to actually leave.My own research as well as that of others also has shown that there are conditions under which feelings of overqualification do not translate into higher turnover. For example in a study conducted in a retail setting we found that empowerment plays the role of a buffer. When employees have autonomy and when they feel that they have the ability to influence their work environment rather than being expected to take a passive coginamachine approach to work their turnover rate is no different from others. So ultimately it may come down to how companies treat their workers rather than their qualifications when they decide whether to stay or leave. ,science,dg36cpm,29,t5_mouw

We only have so much bandwidth in our heads. Filtering is a skill that allows for maximum effort for the things chosen as most important.This research suggests the bandwith is there it just doesnt get used which is consistent with the observation that adults typically use only a fraction of the synapses in their brain.gtYou seem to be assuming that the decision of what to focus on is random rather than somewhat intelligently decided.I was replying to the reality tunnel article linked above and anectodally that seems to be the case. While not completely random the filtering does seem to be largely arbitrary.gtOur brains arent really wired for natural statistical analyse.

11561657,0,t1_dg6gg8l,Not yet. Neuroscientists are polarized in an internal debate regarding the sentience of non human animals. The rule of thumb however is based on the size of an animals social group. Intelligence as well as relative brain size and prefrontal cortex maturation is nicely correlated with the number of conspecifics in an animals social group. The more social  the more intelligent and sentient.Humans maintain the largest social group and human brain size on the primate spectrum predicts the average size of ones social group actively maintained on social media.

Complex numbers are enough.If hypercomplex numbers were necessary there may be measurable differences between a quantum theory based on hypercomplex numbers and ordinary complex numbers that is current quantum theory. They devised an experiment which if it did turn a positive result would mean that quantum mechanics in terms of complex numbers is incomplete. However they ended up showing a null result so that standard quantum mechanics using complex numbers is still the best description we have.

BDNF Overexpression Prevents Cognitive Deficit Elicited by Adolescent Cannabis Exposure and Host Susceptibility Interaction. Human Molecular Genetics  DOI .hmgddxLink Abstractgt Cannabis abuse in adolescence is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders. tetrahydrocannabinol THC is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. DisruptedInSchizophrenia DISC protein is a driver for major mental illness by influencing neurodevelopmental processes. Here utilizing a unique mouse model based on host DISC X environment THC administration interaction we aimed at studying the pathobiological basis through which THC exposure elicits psychiatric manifestations. WildType and dominantnegativeDISC DNDISC mice were injected with THC mgkg or vehicle for  days during midadolescenceequivalent period. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess exploratory activity open field test lightdark box test and cognitive function novel object recognition test. Electrophysiological effect of THC was evaluated using acute hippocampal slices and hippocampal cannabinoid receptor type  and brainderived neurotrophic factor BDNF protein levels were measured. Our results indicate that THC exposure elicits deficits in exploratory activity and recognition memory together with reduced shortterm synaptic facilitation and loss of BDNF surge in the hippocampus of DNDISC mice but not in wildtype mice. Overexpression of BDNF in the hippocampus of THCtreated DNDISC mice prevented the impairment in recognition memory. The results of this study imply that induction of BDNF following adolescence THC exposure may serve as a homeostatic response geared to maintain proper cognitive function against exogenous insult. The BDNF surge in response to THC is perturbed in the presence of mutant DISC suggesting DISC may be a useful probe to identify biological cascades involved in the neurochemical electrophysiological and behavioral effects of cannabis related psychiatric manifestations.,science,dgtebv1,4,t5_mouw

I remember in grade school some  years ago our science teacher explaining how at the time we could more or less accurately predict weather for the coming two days. They then further said we approximate the weather for the remainder of the  day forecast and that with advances in computing technology in the future that could be much more accurate for much farther in the future. So far as I can tell in the  years since my science teacher said that the forecast is very much the same now as it was then. My question is has weather forecasting actually significantly improved over that time or is it really more or less the same? Followup question if it HAS improved why do we still get the same kind of forecast via the typical outlets as we always have?,science,dgtlgkt,1,t5_mouw

This is mathematically equivalent to the expected areal coverage of precipitation. Its important to understand that in most places most of the year  is much greater than the longterm average probability of precipitation so the forecast is telling you its more likely to rain than an average day.
