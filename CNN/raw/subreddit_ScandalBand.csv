1873185,0,t3_2fz38m,For me its gotta be  Jikan Plus no Yoake Mae. I think Shunkan Sentimental Aitai and Hachigatsu are all tied for second place.,ScandalBand,ckewudn,3,t5_2vevr

2402535,0,t3_2my7x5,Decent song. Bridge is not so great.My favorite recent song is still Rainy by far. It should have been a single instead of a bside. ,ScandalBand,cm8nuem,3,t5_2vevr

6777434,0,t1_d0cx5n4,I absolutely agree with you except the bit about Rina shes my favorite.The new abum doesnt have much of what made me like Scandal in the first place. Its way too poppy for my taste and the influence from westernAmerican poprock is very apparent in a bad way both in the music and their image.Thats not to say there arent any good songs on the album and its clear that theyve still got the ability to rock out as evidenced by Flashback but overall Im very disappointed.But thats just like my opinion man. If they want to go this route more power to them. Whatever makes them happy is cool but youll find me sitting in the corner listening to Queens Are Trumps instead.,ScandalBand,d0ki7zu,2,t5_2vevr
11680724,0,t1_dgjenf5,yeah right now its just those  tshirts it was opening yesterday hence the flower stand from Scandal.Scandal keeps collaborating lately so something will probably happen around June ,ScandalBand,dgk0z17,1,t5_2vevr
