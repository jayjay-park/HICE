611475,0,t3_214qm9,Im not enthusiastic about Britain encouraging a socalled parallel legal system  on the other hand since what this is actually saying is that people can have their wills drawn up in a way that theyre happy with I dont see a problem here.  Should I infer that currently a person cant stipulate in their will that their female heirs should be left out of the inheritance?

771275,0,t1_cgrxnjw,.  You did not answer at all.. Any rule.  Any.  But for discussions sake voter id..  At what point will we have we atoned for racism in this country?  I would like to point out that our president is black.. It has already done a lot of good for millions of people.  Thats premature I think.. Because theyre not children?  At what point do they qualify as children?  As to death row... I think that cases need to be totally locked down before an execution is carried out but these people are actually GUILTY of heinous things.  Why should they be allowed to live?. Can you give some specifics on these terrible regulations?   American companies pay low taxes.  We have the highest corporate tax rates in the world.  Yes even with loopholes.  gtRight now no one has money to buy widgets.  This is a definite exaggeration.  gtCompanies are doing as well as they ever have and are sitting on trillions of dollars. If no one is buying widgets... how are companies doing as well as they ever have?gtJob creators are most decidedly NOT creating jobs. But you folks say were in a recovery.. gtThis is classic conservatism blaming the symptom rather than the problem. When the War on Poverty started one in six were in poverty.  Right now one in six are still in poverty.  gt There are three applicants for every job. Talk to the job creators about this one.Companies exist to make money.  You were claiming they sold less widgets.  Maybe we ought to give them a tax break..  Yes there are some restrictions already.  Assault weapons are already banned IIRC..gtThe nd Amendment was written at a time when weaponry was very different and the politics of the country was very differentThe first part of this is irrelevant.  It says arms.  The citizens were allowed the same arms that the military had.  There are more restrictions now already.The second part of that was fascinating because....gt the nd Amendment was about foreign invaders...ORLY?  The British were HERE.  They werent invading.  We threw off our GOVERNMENT and established a new one.Thats the point of the Second Amendment..gt Two unpaidfor wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq especially IraqBoth approved of by Congress because Bush was a guy who sought approval when necessary.gt unpaidfor tax cuts for the wealthyEveryone got a tax cut.

The formula is supposed to be updated regularly but the Department of Education had not done so for  years he said.At that time state and local taxes were on average higher than they are today he said. As a result the recalibrated formula makes it appear that families have more income available to pay college expenses than they did.Its always regrettable when federal student aid to individuals is reduced he said. This shows the perils of not updating formulas for  years.gtpushed NCLBWhich was coauthored by Teddy Kennedy.gtsaw millions more people fall into povertyDue to an economic collapse that was not his fault.

Thats a new one on me.gt This is a slippery slope which could easily lead to private corporations siting religious freedom in their decision not to hire a qualified applicant because of that persons sexual orientation. No.  Read the decision again.  It is very very narrow.That said we do now have companies surveying employees on whether they are allies of the LGBT community...so it appears you are correct but not because of this Supreme Court decision and in the opposite direction.

2113013,0,t3_2j4xg9,From the articleThe head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Monday that other U.S. hospital workers may have Ebola after a Dallas nurse tested positive for the virus as he vowed to double down on training for health care workers  raising questions about whether he told the truth when he initially assured the public and Congress that U.S. hospitals are capable of treating Ebola patients. Thomas Frieden at a press briefing on Monday said the CDC would be taking a number of steps including offering more training and outreach throughout the health care system. He said they need to rethink their approach to the virus. well that just reassures me. I am convinced that the CDC has it all under control.,Conservatives_R_Us,cl8eqt3,1,t5_2wney

4567129,0,t1_ct6a6z3,gt Lets neglect to mention Soviet strategy logistics technology tactic differences and the complete ineptitude of Stalin. When you kill off or remove most of your experienced officers and replace them with political hacks just before a war your military doesnt tend to do well.  When expressing the slightest variation from the party line gets you disappeared or cashiered you lose your best and brightest.  When the best idea your politically loyal officers can come up with to motivate the troops is to set up machine guns behind them and massacre any who run away that has some unpleasant side effects in terms of morale and your ability to win the war.  Fortunately for the Soviets they had General Winter.gt Officer corps requires professionalism...No it doesnt.  It requires fancy uniforms toeing the line and being willing to say the right things to the right people.  Political connections are also useful and above a certain level are necessary.gt Lets just say for example we do have someone that might have insider knowledge of a potential threat. Would you personally violate the Geneva Convention to extract that knowledge knowing that you would be held liable as a war criminal and a war tribunal would crucify you?Depending on the imminence and severity of the threat and how sure I was yes I just might.  ...and then when the immediate threat was over Id turn myself in for prosecution.  To make it a bit more concrete lets say you have in hand one Zacarias Moussaoui in late August .  You have reliable intelligence that there is going to be a massive terrorist attack on the US very soon  and no details on exactly when where how or who is involved  but youre pretty sure he knows them.  Do you do whatever is necessary to get the information or do you assign him a public defender and let  American civilians die?  Your call.gt Faith Again youre wrong. The military respects all faiths as long as it conforms to the DoD directives. Which is generally pretty broad. I dont know to which example you want to expound on how the faith is being butchered but I disagree .gt Not Obamas fault. Ill briefly explain how it works the president spends the money controls taxes and HAS to purchase what congress tells him to purchase. Congress establishes the budget and tells the president what needs to be bought.His idea he pushed for it because he was expecting Republicans to turn it down.  As to the rest are you under the impression that the military advisers like Chuck Hagel have no input into what Congress budgets?
