9410075,0,t1_d98qujw,Eventually yes but it may be useful around midgame to optimize a mirage you really like using.Additionally Im curious about the SP used to unlock transfigurations.  Since if you catch a different transfig or unlock the transfig on a duplicate mirage you get access to that transfig on every other mirage of that type for free.  Does this mean that points spent unlocking transfigs ends up getting wasted?  tho it is pretty minimal at most I guess it could be  SP total,WorldOfFinalFantasy,d98sk4t,1,t5_38p8h

9469822,0,t3_5ab0o8,I was in a similar situation being burnt out over the years of FF releases maybe just me growing out of it. However i picked up this game for my vita to play onthego and was pleasantly surprised! Its a breath of fresh air for the FF series the whole chibisilly style will grow on you quite quickly.  I think the game designers really had lots of fun making this FF because the game itself isnt trying to be super serious or wannabegritty FF.. tried to be dark but fails its mostly slapstick funny and for FFveterans the bios for every monster you meet is worth reading for the chuckle.   Fights and puzzles are mostly simple no grinding is required unless you are a completionist. Just an enjoyable game by itself!,WorldOfFinalFantasy,d9gd0dx,1,t5_38p8h
9480985,0,t3_5amidx,There are  ways I can think of that you could use to obtain the mirage..Kill yourself and then reload into the murkrift only recommended if you have saved a reasonable amount of time before entering the murkrift though pain to travel through the dungeon.Defeat the mirage and gain a memento since you will encounter a unicorn before you encounter an Odin for the mementoI would personally take option  since the time inbetween the unicorn and the Odin is enough to level to ,WorldOfFinalFantasy,d9hqi2y,1,t5_38p8h
9494857,0,t1_d9ia1tz,The new mirages will make sense when you get to Chapter . They should have locked them to story progression like they did the Intervention quest I think. Would lead to less confusion.,WorldOfFinalFantasy,d9jfzvw,1,t5_38p8h

10950912,0,t1_de9fdms,Id say be patient and shoot them when they get close so you will get a straight line trajectory. I usually only shoot those that travel in straight line coz its easier. If you dont think u will get the shot its better to let them pass by instead of missing a shot. Shoot the black Einhander instead of the regular ones as they give higher score. Also their pattern repeat so I only aim at those that I m confident in scoring every round. Just be patient you dont have to aim at every Einhander that comes in.,WorldOfFinalFantasy,de9ic1x,2,t5_38p8h
