The codrivers job is to navigate by reading off a set of pacenotes to the driver often over a radio headset due to the high level of noise in the car. The codriver tells the driver what lies ahead where to turn the severity of the turn and what obstacles to look out for. This role is particularly critical in highend rally competitions such as WRC. Codrivers are also often called on to perform maintenance on the car during road sections and special stages such as changing a wheel.,SweatyPalms,d21v6qj,35,t5_2v567
