The slots available gear will show up at the bottom.. Near the top there is a recycle icon. Click that.. A recycle icon will now show up on all items at the bottom.

Also  I do have a small but annoying bug to report. I cant seem to complete the Demon Feet quest in the Tundra area. I did have a demon spawn from one of the geysirs once but Hewgo chose to do one of his random appearances right then and there and lasered it right in front of me. Ive been playing for a week or two  many an hourgeysir  and have progressed pretty far to the point where the item from this quest is no longer beneficial but havent encountered a second demon and am worried that I mightve been robbed of this quest by the dastardly Hewgo.

6635007,0,t1_d05lk9v,Solved it! According to another post if you recycled these items the quest remains open. Remanufacture them go back to Sirix so he can curse you out then go see Chikkix in Toochoochoonax. Hope you remember where you put the Brubus debate lamps! Theyre the small ground lights like those around Toochoochoonax.Heres the other postThere was a bug in this quest where picking up the NPCs floor tile was sometimes impossible. In the bugfix patch the floor tile requirement is reduced by one so this quest is now fully functional when you update.Some of you have apparently been immediately recycling those components even though youre supposed to bring them back to the quest giver. That obviously means you cant complete the quest unless you craft those components to bring back to the quest giver. For your convenience heres what you need crystal walls crystal floors crystal door Brubus Debate LampsThis is a sidequest so it isnt required to complete the game. Note that there is another quest requiring you to pick up and turn in gold floors. For the love of god do not recycle those gold floors are super costly to craft.In the QOL update well be adding a criteria that you cannot recycle something if it is the objective of a quest. In the meantime... recycle smart. ,crashlands,d05m7sc,1,t5_30271
