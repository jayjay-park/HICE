Horror as a genre is on sort of a downswing in favor of easily digestible books or books converted to easily digestible TVmovies.

3863280,0,t1_cqvyhfx,My theory is he has his own internal time line. But the world changes around him. Think of it like being in a river. Hes got on hip waders and is walking across. The water is the current time period. Sometimes  swirls by sometimes its . Hes still Cecil. The swirling water gets him wet and changes him to some degree giving him new memories and erasing old ones but he is still doing what hes doing and he just accepts them.There is an old story about how trying to reach absolute zero they accidently figure out how to go into hyperspace. Going there drives you insane because  dimensional people arent equipped to handle it when you see  parallel lines meet at  perfect right angles forming  triangles.She could barely handle it herself because she was trained to accept the impossible. But she could only handle it for a few moments. They tried to force her to show them but she new the technology wouldnt work just yet so she used her new ability to take a short cut and got away. Then she had a baby and raised it in the other dimension. Basically the baby learned there was On Earth and Over There and had no problem accepting impossibilities.I suspect thats what Cecil is. You raise a baby in a world where you might be doing a radio broadcast before the invention of radio you just roll with it and you never worry about the contradiction. In Night Vale parallel lines can meet and still remain parallel. They can accept it easily. It drives us insane.,nightvale,cqwncqo,2,t5_2xvez

4109109,0,t3_37kx3g,My original was that Night Vale was some sort of automated facility that kept cloning people when they died and gave them memories of places because well adjusted people travel. A certain percentage of all clones were randomly selected to have the European college experience upgrade.However given recent events I am leaning towards the theory that the Blood Space War which has existed since episode one is a Time war and they just keep Fing everything up.We know of several alternate time lines time lines The Real World One The one where space lizards rule the world the one where the stock crash of  never happened the one where there was a nuclear war in  So I think we can conclude that there simply is some sort of on going time based war going on and everything is changing all the time. So far the night vale faction has been winning.However theres no reason to assume Night Vale is the only place on the planet like it. Svitz Francia and Luftnarp all versions of Switzerland France and Germany we assume are Countries when they could actually be Night Vales.Nulgorsk is also a potential night vale but I suspect that whats going on is that these various locations are at war. Each one fighting for control of Time. Right now NV is winning. The reason for all the strangeness at the other four locations is simply put incompatability. People on True Night Vale Time have a strange interaction in these other Night Vales Svitz results in time loops. Francia measn you cannot interact with anyone there. Nulgorsk is destroyed and not destroyed in a single moment in time. Luftnarp is moving VERY SLLLLOOOOWWWWWWWLLLLLLYYYYyyyyyy.You get the idea.,nightvale,cronwkx,6,t5_2xvez

Think of all the friends youll make but eventually lose.You dont want that! No!You know the earth is eventually going to be swallowed by the sun right? And one day you would be present for this greatest of all apocalypses. As fascinating as this would be scientifically speaking this excitement would fade as the pain of thousanddegree flames engulfed your tender body and your aged mind would be so alone in this interminable torture.Does this sound like something you want? We didnt think so.Immortality is stupid.

5042201,0,t1_cumq48s,When Cecil accidentally told Kevin about the secret revolution Night Vale was planning and Kevin said hed send Daniel that didnt worry me I figured out it was indeed a bootstrap paradox and our timeline exists precisely because Cecil told Kevin about the resistance.But when he told younger Kevin that everything would be okay near the end...that really got me. Kevin failed because Cecil lied to him to comfort him. It is possible that if Cecil had told Kevin that hed most likely be unable to resist against Strexcorp then maybe Kevin wouldve fought harder and ended victorious but...well Cecil had no choice in the matter since his actions stem from the timeline he is already in where Strexcorp successfully take over Desert Bluffs and all of its citizens.I find nearly every episode interesting but this one in particular I think it could be used in a philosophy class as a starting point for discussion of time travel paradoxes and free willdeterminism.,nightvale,cutryfm,6,t5_2xvez

5287205,0,t1_cvnho7p,I know. But something I love about LRR makers of qwerpline is that they have patreon tiers with cool perks but they dont restrict any content. They want people to donate because they enjoy the comedy not because they want to get special stuff. Granted LRR might have a larger viewerbase than WTNV.Not trying to rag on night vale just stating my opinion.  ,nightvale,cvni3r2,4,t5_2xvez
5290261,0,t1_cvnq6v4,I should also note that the reason why Im thinking about it is because I already have all  episodes and bonus episodes stripped for my own use. Itd be easy to convert and upload.And note I will not be touching any live shows bootlegs or any of the episodes that will be behind a pay wall. Thats how they make their money and I will ONLY handle the free stuff. In fact from what I heard what WTNV needs are the stripped down episodes and a series of BEST OFs In order to encourage new fans.Ive been toying with the idea of a Best of playlist where I do supercuts of various topics. Supercut of the glow cloud. Supercut of steve carlsberg. Supercut of the angels. Supercut of the sponsors. That sort of thing.The problem with the weather is also a matter of copyright. TECHNICALLY while many of the translations Ive uploaded have the weather for each translated episode included nobody is allowed to.Only the owner of the Weather is allowed to give permission for usable and nothing in the FAQ confers a transfer of copyright under fair use. However under the FAQ I am permitted to assuming I do NOT include the weather do whatever I want with the rest of the episode. As long as I get it directly off the feed and not from the itunes store.So I can REMOVE whatever I want within the Fair Use Rules according to the FAQ but I am not allowed to use the weather. I do but ONLY on the translations to other languages.Its an ethical dilemma. By law I should remove the weather but then it would make it less enjoyable for those who dont speak English. I think the benefit for Night Vale Presents far outweighs the legal concerns and until the request comes in from the owners of the songs to remove the content Im going to just keep doing it and hope that they see the chance for an increased audience is worth this minor bending of the rules.I mean the vague way the FAQ is written I could make a case that the songs are now all public but I could make a case against it as well. So either way the point is moot.The only originals I will upload are ones translated into other languages or ones with the music removed. If you want the weather go listen to the original. Simple as that.,nightvale,cvnw5o0,1,t5_2xvez

His ghost story was the highlight of the evening. I just think a live performance could benefit from a more elaborate  exciting selfcontained plot. gt If you dont want mistakes dont go to a live show.

11533590,0,t3_64li1b,Couple notesYou left out the Shambling Orphan Housing Development and the Haunted Baseball Diamond. Both are near each other and near Desert Flowers. Also left out the Opera House.The Hospital Im pretty sure is near the Abandoned Mine Shaft since it was built for the miners.But Im also getting the impression that this is an older map before a lot of stuff was added. Still pretty cool!,nightvale,dg3c23b,41,t5_2xvez

11708226,0,t1_dgd14oy,BTW whats the deal with Cecils brother? I thought he was Kevin for awhile the two are implied to look alike but arent doubles. We know from Dana that doubles look identical and share memories Dana doesnt know if shes the original Dana or the double while Cecil and Kevin appear to have different sets of memories. Kevin remembers living in Desert Bluffs prior to the sandstorm while Cecil appears to have no memory of such a place. Kevin also doesnt seem to recognize the Night Vale radio station which he would if he had the same memories as Cecil. However theres also a theory that Cecils brother is actually Abby pretransition. I havent heard Ghost Stories yet so my knowledge of the information contained in that live show is limited. Im not sure if we get any information about Cecils brother after Cassettes.tldr Does anyone know whats going on with Cecils brother?,nightvale,dgn5o92,1,t5_2xvez
