1848164,0,t1_ckbi72r,Thanks!Im trying to bring more variety to the succubi. So far Rikki is the productive one drives the limo and works in Lucifers office Kikki is the kinky one popped into the narrators dorm at Lucifers behest when the narrator was ranting about still being a virgin. And Agatha is the crazy one works the torture chambers. If i can squeeze her in i want to show Nikki the nerdy one. Ill certainly endeavour to bring more!,BadElf21,ckbwdpr,4,t5_33cx8
1938618,0,t1_cklgncu,At least in my interpretation of it Luke is neither omniscient not omnipotent. Those two traits are reserved for Dear Old Dad. So youre allowed to have him screw up. I think a fusion of the three would be best where Luke tries to cover it up the narrator gets angry when its fully revealed and then comes to accept it as he cant change the past and Luke has been his friend these past however many years. The entire conflict doesnt have to be resolved in one conversation. You can make a bit of a story arc about it with the narrator not returning Lukes calls Luke growing increasingly more upsetcreative the narrator realizing that Luke is his best friend and maybe Susan making the two of them sit down and talk it out. Or the narrator making a new pentagram out of train tracks to summon Luke again. Something like that.Basically merge the three ideas dont rush to one extreme end of them.  ,BadElf21,ckmsp50,2,t5_33cx8
2039998,0,t1_ckz4nif,Okay sweetie! Blow out the candles! Mom cheered.I took a deep breath and blew out the candles on my strawberry birthday cake. I was of course going to have another party with my friends later but mom and dad agreed we should have small private one first so they could give me whatever unique presents they had.Open mine first! Mom said eagerly handing me a rather large narrow box.I tore off the wrapping and lifted the contents out.I honestly did not know what to say Its... its...Its your very own scythe! Mom squealed It has a folding blade for easy storage and can reap any and all beings including celestials! Its indestructible and even has a six millennium warranty!Just what I always wanted. I said sarcastically.Come on! Try it out! Mom pleaded.Oh alright but later... Dad what have you got? I asked.My gift is in the backyard follow me. Dad directed. You know how you always wanted a pony but I kept saying no because you werent ready yet? Well I think youre ready now.Dad opened the backdoor to reveal a majestic horse... that was also a demonic spawn of hell. It was black but had a literally flaming mane and seemed to trot with flaming hooves. Its eyes glowed a brilliant orange and tail also consisted of flames. It glanced at me and seemed to smile with sharp teeth.I was hoping for a car. I said unappreciatively.She can use portals so she can take you anywhere in an instant including hell and peoples dreams. And you dont have to pay car insurance. Dad explained.I walked up to he reached out. She nuzzled my hand and scratched the ground burning a track of grass with her flaming hooves. I petted her flaming mane and quickly withdrew when i noticed my sleeve on fire. I was immune but my clothes werent.Well get you some fireproof riding clothes when you want to ride her. What do you say? Dad asked.Well... I guess having a demonic pony wouldnt hurt. I relented.Wonderful! Do you want to give her a new name?Ummm... i dont know... Twilight Sparkle? I joked.,BadElf21,ckz4nl1,19,t5_33cx8

2066982,0,t1_cl2ioxf,I really liked this story but at first the transitions were hard to understand. After I realised what was going on and reread it I really enjoyed the idea and story.,BadElf21,cl2k4z6,1,t5_33cx8
2860100,0,t1_cnsq7bx,You may be imagining something like My Breast Friend but its not made to walk around in. Anyways its your world so I suppose you could make something up.,BadElf21,cnt70n8,1,t5_33cx8
3269786,0,t1_cp0ubqj,gt Yeah im thinking the ring is a special artifact she obtained for that purpose. But im not sure if i want to make it that easy for her.gt gt im still deciding if that story should be canonThe ring doesnt have to be the end of that story arc. Just give it a massive drawback like needing to be recharged after  minutes or only working within a certain distance of its large groundbased control system. Then the point would be to let her decide whether additional effort is worth it and increasereduce her motivation on this sidequest accordingly.,BadElf21,cp0zddp,1,t5_33cx8
