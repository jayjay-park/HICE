1052690,0,t3_2652bz,I have thought about this.  The only way youre going to be able to pull data is through the ps.  Idk of the game knows what controller is plugged in.  Im not sure if it sends FFB signals to DSs anyways they just cant utilize it etc.  Or if it can distinguish.  Im fairly certain the game cant and it sends the signals anyways.  I figure this because certain wheels handle the same FFB signals differently.  Theyre not tailored to the wheel theyre just tailored via strength and sensitivity.  I would like to find a program that can at least accept the data going to the wheel.  I just want to see what is being sent.  You could piggy back off the cable by splicing in I just dont know what program to use to accept and look at the data.  Be it in hex values etc.  Do you know of any programs?  Piggy backing off the USB from the ps to the wheel is the way to do it.  The hex values can be converted for sure.  I know that much.

1914178,0,t3_2gitvl,Dont use max DF.  Only up front.   in rear. Dont lock the diff too high.  Use small amounts of camber with a little more in the rear.  Dont use abs.  Youre not going to lock up anyways.  Even on a control.  Set front brake to six leave rear at five.  Toe settings are all based on how you drive then optimizing them best as possible without much compromise between grip and feel.Most people are losing their time at the first horse shoe entry and exit.  Then basically every other exit for the remainder of the track.  Turns  really need to be sewn together perfectly with very little lift off the throttle.  It is a make or break section of the lap.  The are many ways to hit the last chicane.  Either way you just want to get through there as quick as possible but not so much so that you cant regain traction when you hit the ground again after hopping the curbs.  This is where rear diff camber and toe are key along with second gear ratio because you need to be on the throttle as you land without much wheel spin.,granturismo,ckjugja,1,t5_2s4f7

GT was designed on the PS the PS has a new system so PD has to learn the new system design a new game and make it right. Every other comment or post is people bitching about the game and how its rushed or a failure. So heres your options here. Wait for them to make a super good game thats worth the wait and play yet another good game until then. Or have PD rush an unfinished that game that everyone will bitch about in unison.

They have a driver that I raced with for a long time and he can take it to immortal but he doesnt go on much anymore.  He and immortal are probably two of the best drivers who play gt.Some people are dicks and have made PSN IDs with trl at the front of the name.
