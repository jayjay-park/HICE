1275158,0,t1_cicza6t,My pleasure! And Im serious about it making a great gift for her. Ive taught her some of the more important progressions chords and scales including some rather oddball ones. Now Im like Jason Bateman in Juno trying to have her work them barre chords. Difficult at first then the easiest and most natural thing in the word  and the key to a whole lot of rock punk and metal history.Our two biggest bonds are over horror films and music and this would be a nice way to tell her I respect her efforts. I already dug up a tuner for her as a gift now that she can tune by ear. ,Learnmusic,cid2ml5,1,t5_2rgto

2512365,0,t3_2od9ib,Im sorry but everything about this sucks.  First of all its not solfege its conducting.  And its shitty conducting.  If you were to try to conduct a group like this it would be worse than nothing.The ictus is all over the place.  In fact the way this is presented is actively encouraging you to avoid creating a good ictus.  Practicing with a surface is a good exercise but you have to actually hit the surface on each beat.  The critical part of the ictus is consistency in the horizontal dimension.Worse theres no connection between the beats.  You say that making a sharp motion is wrong but thats totally appropriate in many situations.  What isnt good is stammering between the beats which youre doing even though its slow and smooth.  Its completely unclear when the beat is coming.  A good litmus test for clarity in your pattern is to get some people together conduct and have them clap when they think the beat is.  If the pattern is good the claps will align perfectly.  Youre gonna get applause with this.That floppy wrist is a major problem too.,Learnmusic,cmmi6cf,3,t5_2rgto

3587488,0,t1_cq15cjp,Believe it or not I realized that doing music that I enjoy is also important. Im learning voice and theres scalelike exercises the lip trills and so forth. Its designed by my vocal coach.On an instrument I probably stuck too much with scalelike patterns. I think songs would be a good way to diagnose where you are having problems and you can choose exercises to help you with it. The original song would be handy to tell if you improvedOtherwise if I did nothing but technique exercises it feels like Im just doing work for no reason. It also held me back because a lot of the technical exercises werent that musical. Your idea of taking on a challenging song or a song that works you out is a good one. If you find yourself doing songs on the side while practicing then you could try incorporating that into your technique. You want to sight read? Is there a song you never played but you absolutely love hearing? Theres your candidate. That is where voice has an advantage for me that I can pick any song and sing along to it. Did you do a bad job? If so did you have fun doing that? If you had fun keep doing it!,Learnmusic,cq179lo,2,t5_2rgto
3589656,0,t3_31euzm,I play guitar mostly electric. My main style is melodic death metal. Im selftaught about  years now. Ive taken music theory and songwriting classes in high school and college. Also did three years of percussion in middle school.  Most of the time I just play a song or riff I know or I play along to a backing track. If I really wanna dig in and practice Ill start with some warm ups and fingerforearm stretches. Chromatics arpeggios  finger runs  finger  finger string skipping. As fast as I can and as slow as I can. Then I begin learning a song that has ideas or techniques Id like to learnexplore. To do that I learn a section then another and then combine them. Then the next section and then combine with the first two and so on. Also always use a metronome. Always. When either playing or practicing.  I also try to write as much as possible. I use an app called Ensemble Composer on android and Musescore on pc. Both free. Lastly try singing a melody and then playing it. Ive found that it helps me write some interesting melodies.,Learnmusic,cq1g5kk,2,t5_2rgto
4015146,0,t1_crdvx2m,If thats a general question about the piano and not a question about jammin then you could look into this But thats not the only Czerny work which can be useful so look around if you want. These are very useful exercises which pretty much cover the beginner phase. If you want to improve your technique theres no better than Czerny. Play these every day.Practicing scales is also essential Im sure you can find all of them on youtube. Practice them with both hands first seperately then together. Then mix it up and make it as hard as you can.Check out rpiano there might be some useful stuff over there too. Also every now and then check out sites like Coursera.org See if they have some piano lessons or music theory or something.You didnt say where youre at in your studies so if youre past all of this sorry. Theres much more to do besides that but you cant go wrong with scales and Czerny.,Learnmusic,crdyglj,2,t5_2rgto

5594379,0,t3_3rq3zw,Yeah for the chord progression build towards a huge resolve like the other guy was talking about.Progressively add more instruments. This is an age old way of writing thats been tried and tested by... Well pretty much everyone from McCartney to your local dubstep guy. Sometimes especially with electronic or heavyish music you can get so caught up in making the most epic shit imaginable that you try to start out at a super high energy level and then add more and more energy which can unintentionally make the song super messy instead of epic. Then its important to understand that whats really important is actually dynamics not the overall energy level compared to other songs. Say fx a slow cheesy rock ballad can have a super epic build up moment that resolves in simply adding drums and a solo. This can be absolutely mind blowing whereas that same solo would be super weak on a heavy metal track. The secret is that theyre starting out relatively low so the burst of energy is like way way high compared to the rest of the song.In a dubstep song if the rest of the song is very pretty and ambient a mediocre drop might just get the job done whereas if you start with some epic shit people are going to expect an even more epic drop. Neither of which are wrong but the dynamics is important. You cant use either drop in the context of the other song.It Never Ends by BMTH is a great metalcore example. The breakdown is not particularly heavy but because the rest of the song is not particularly heavy either it gets just the right feel.,Learnmusic,cwqj9oy,3,t5_2rgto

9725440,0,t1_dabbe1r,gt So does it matter that its Bbm or Am? YES YES IT MATTERS.First things first F A C is misspelled.  It should be F Bb Db if youre making a Bbm chord or E A C if youre making an Am chord.  Both of these are perfectly viable chords.  However F A C is most likely misspelled and Ill try to explain why.  There might actually be a reason to spell it that way by the way and you can probably contrive a situation where it might make sense if you try hard enough but as a minor triad its gotta be Bbm or Am and not this weird hybrid.So there are generally speaking  notes in a diatonic scale.  Some have more or less and that actually leads to some problems but for the most part there are  notes and those  notes each get a different letter name.  So your scale has some sort of C some sort of D some sort of E some sort of F some sort of G some sort of A and some sort of B and these notes are related in a simple way.  So for example if you have C and Eb you know that theres some kind of D between them if you have C and D you know that there isnt.  These two intervals will sound the same if you play them on their own like the words here and hear but they mean different things and the music will treat them differently.  C and D is a dissonance that will generally resolve up to C and E C and Eb is a consonance that doesnt need resolution.  The notes of the scale are named for their relationship to the tonic and to the other notes a respelled note indicates a different relationship.This gets a little hairy when you go outside of a scale and introduce other notes.  What role do these other notes have?  Sometimes its easy to tell because theyll be obviously related to some of the notes you already have.  For example if youre in C major you may have C  D and you know its a C because its the th of D.  On the other hand you might have F  F where F is the th of G but it resolves down to F the th of C.  You might have Gb  F where Gb is the b of F.  Basically to spell a note correctly you need to figure out what its important relationships are.  F  F and Gb  F sound the same so how do you choose between them?  Its not necessarily simple and sometimes there may not be an obvious right answer.  Hell you may even need to spell it F  E!It becomes much worse when youre writing atonal music because you may not actually have these note relationships at all.  F and F are just sounds and they arent related to any other sounds they just are.  Some atonal composers put accidentals on every note including naturals on notes that dont have them and they dont name notes with reference to a scale.  Theorists analyzing atonal music use a different nomenclature they use numbers to label the steps in the tone chromatic scale so that theyre not misled by nonindicative note names.gt The only bit of info I was given that helped was that sharps are for ascending and flats are for descending.Thats not actually true but it works much of the time.  If youre writing a chromatic run then yeah you do that.  The reason why is because youre kind of treating the sharp note as the th of the next note.  So for example if you write C D D E the C is the th of D and the D is the th of E.  On the way down if you have Eb D Db C the Eb is the b of D and the Db is the b of C.  These the  and the b are known as leading tones the th especially and they pull strongly towards their .  Naming the notes this way makes this relationship clear.  But again its not always something you want to do because that relationship isnt always actually there.  For example if youre in Bb minor you might spell a chromatic run upwards as G Ab A Bb B C Db D and a downward one as D Db C Cb Bb A Ab G  flats both ways well except the B natural turning to Cb.  Why?  Because the Ab is the b of Bb its part of the scale.  The Db isnt a stepping stone to the D its the b of the scale.  But the B really is a stepping stone up to the C and the Cb really is a stepping stone down to the Bb.To sum it all up the spelling of a note is a direct representation of its relationship to other notes and thats why it matters.,Learnmusic,dabvgqz,4,t5_2rgto
