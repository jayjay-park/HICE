The scale has three designated categories called TypeI II and III. A TypeI civilization uses all available resources impinging on its home planet TypeII harnesses all the energy of its star and TypeIII of its galaxy. The scale is only hypothetical but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. It was first proposed in  by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev Kardashyov. Various extensions of the scale have been proposed since from a wider range of power levels types  IV and V to the use of metrics other than pure power.gtgtImage iInteresting The Kardashev Scale album | Dyson sphere | Nikolai Kardashev | Greydon Square Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclyxts oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeleteclyxts.

2344492,0,t3_2m6xag,Disclaimer All numbers here are orders of magnitude. I thought for instance that time dilation on Millers planet was     not    . So my numbers are very rough.He was not orbiting the planet. When Cooper did his drawing they decided against that as they would lose too much time at planets orbit. When you orbit Millers planet time slows down for you by pretty much a factor of  .So what they do is orbit the black hole at a safe distance. The secondary vessel undocks from the one Romilly stays on and they make a direct slowdown by boosting retrograde and getting their orbital velocity to zero and free falling to Millers planet in every sense of the word free.The time dilation depends on the strength of the gravitational field which goes down by r. So that time dilation of a factor of     can be cut down to a factor of   . by being a factor of  further away from the blackhole than Millers planet is.Fun fact time goes slower on earth too from memory a factor of     . On the surface of the sun it is a factor of around     .Being far away from the bodies will help suppress time dilation unintuitively easy To some people the concept of time dilation is very intuitive. It is merely not intuitive at first because we dont experience it in our every day life. Once you spend a few years dealing with it it seems almost natural. Technically speaking freefalling does not mean no orbital velocity. In that sense freefalling would for instance be earth freefalling around the sun. However in that case I mean freefalling like an apple would fall on the ground.,interstellar,cm1hokk,5,t5_2w1k9

2374655,0,t1_cm55gcl,If Edmunds planet was close to the blackhole like Millers then why did they not have the fuel to make it there. They were at Millers and went to Manns which was outside the time dilation affects of Gargantua but then Edmunds planet was back closer to Gargantua again? The slingshotted around Gargantua to get to Edmunds planet. That was the point of the whole last scene where Coop disconnects. Except Coop goes into Gargantua and so does TARS. Brand successfully gets around and ends up at Edmunds planet. Either way your math adds up. That being saidn it is safe to assume that it is under time dilation because only time dilation can explain the fact that Amelia Brand remained much about the same age whereas many years had passed after Murphs solution to the gravity equation years.EDIT It is also worth noting that it seems closer to the black hole because the climates. Manns planet was icy and barren whereas Edmunds was more sunny and desertlike. This could be because of the proximity of it to the energy source gargantua.,interstellar,cm57s90,1,t5_2w1k9
2375307,0,t3_2mlbll,I dont think theres a solution that can be found inside the movie. I wrote this in another thread gtIf Im allowed to freely speculate within a realistic frame then I guess it could be possible for some extremely alien higher being to have started the chain reaction that led to the paradox. These being could perhaps manipulate time in a way we cant comprehend. They could have been the ones sending the initial gravitational waves the binary coordinates and all other messages as a way to initiate the chain of events that led to Cooper travelling out to space. And due to the selfconsistency principle of the universe Cooper automatically created the same actions that the higher beings initially did when he got into the black hole hence creating the loop but also saving the people on Earth. gtThe whole problem with the ontological paradox is that we cant trace the origin of the original piece of information. But if we introduce beings transcending time which is the thing that limit us the origin of this information can be explained. gtgtI mean it becomes very easy to twist and turn things to your favors when Godlike beings and weird stuff are involved.

2405729,0,t1_cm5apkc,I did extremely well on the SAT but I dont believe that the weight it is given in applications is in proportion to its usefulness. In part this is because the SAT ends up testing ones ability to take standardized tests which is all fine and well if one has been raised in an educational environment that contains a lot of standardized testing. In other words if you hail from a poor school district youre at an immediate disadvantage as you likely wont be as prepared for the testing format and environment. In a related vein the SAT continues to suffer from cultural bias in its questions if you dont come from a wealthy white family youll likely be at a disadvantage during the test. Now the SAT is being changed again for  so well see if the College Board has learned anything new I dont have particularly high hopes.While I agree that GPA is probably more useful than a grade on a single test from a single class it contains no information about what an applicants distribution of skills is. It is distilled from the information contain in the transcript without regard to the types and difficulties of the underlying classes and it ignores any external factors that might have had an impact on the applicants performance in those classes. In light of that why use it at all? A full transcript with notes on the applicants home and educational environment is far more useful.,interstellar,cm9228j,-1,t5_2w1k9

2428123,0,t1_cmbmyt6,I disagree. I think the notion of exploring and colonizing a planet in a faraway galaxy would not only make a good standalone scifi movie but a good sequel to Interstellar too. The biggest threat to the characters in Interstellar was space itself the waves on the oceanplanet the icyinhospitable nature of Manns planet and Gargantua. Now on Edmunds planet suddenly there would be a whole new series of threats. What kinds of challenges would the colony face? What kinds of fauna and natural life there would be threatening? From the glimpse of Edmunds planet that we get we dont see any water. Are there dust storms? Is water a rarity?The universe that Interstellar establishes is so ripe with storytelling opportunity. Even though I doubt a sequel would be made I think that it would be incredibly entertaining. That and the characters of Cooper and Brand are so well developed that I would love to see where they would go next.,interstellar,cmbtn3j,1,t5_2w1k9

2513436,0,t1_cmeqqvu,Not to bring up old shit but I saw the movie again and there must be more than one system that was initially  explored.  In the Confrence room someone I think Amelia says the worm hole lets them travel to other stars...plural. And that one system shows promise. Implying there were other systems explored besides the one we see in the movie. One system with three potential worlds. My only guess is that maybe the wormhole goes to more than one place? Maybe they choose which system to go to when they fly into the worm hole? Head for the first star to the left. There is no evidence for that since they seem to just run into it and get swept away to where ever it is going. Maybe its just bad writing or poor choice of dialogue. Maybe it is a relic of an earlier draft?  I was reading an interview with Professor Thorne and Christopher Nolan on wired I think. Evidently when Christopher Nolan signed on there were like three black holes and five wormholes. He felt that was too confusing for the audience and said there can only be one of each. He was afraid that even the one black hole and one wormhole might be confusing enough. So maybe the dialogue that implies multiple start systems and potentially another planet or two in other star systems might just be a holdover from earlier drafts of the script. If there was originally  wormholes each leading to different systems the dialogue makes sense. ,interstellar,cmmn7tq,1,t5_2w1k9

2664337,0,t1_cn6ccd9,Solaris strikes me as more magical realism than science fiction.  Basically anything is game and no science is needed.  I agree to the extent that interstellar uses the science as a tool andor framing device to tell a story about exploration.  It is my opinion that this it does exceptionally well in a very believable way that is true to actual science.  Perhaps you believe the wrong tool has been used which is fine I guess.  But that doesnt mean it was used badly.  Im not sure what would or wouldt qualify as valid as Im unsure what the criteria you would use for a measure of validity.  My original comment was intended to express that not everyone needs  pages to tell them what is going with the theoretical physics.  What indiana jones is supposed to bring to the discussion and why Kip Thorne should have anything to say about a fictional archaeologist is beyond me in relation to this discussion.  gtHis science still doesnt explain the Deus Ex Machina.That is because the science involved is not Deus Ex Machina.  It is an inherent part of a well constructed plot.  Watching the movie carefully and understanding the physics behind it should be enough to understand that.

2696685,0,t1_cnais82,gttrying to make it seem like its all just a facadeThis is one of the things I would file under speculation or imaginative thinking that I use to help deal with some of your points and questions. I am trying to get you to think a little differently.  I will try to stick only to the movie going forward.  Though I would argue that that is what the movie is showing us that there is something wrong with our understanding about the nature of time and causality.  Clearly as seen in the movie someone in the future can do something that creates an effect in the past.  It is undeniable.  gtAgain the problem is literally everything else weve seen in the universe follows strict laws of causality EXCEPT the D beings. This is absolutely untrue.  Again in the film Cooper like the D beings also breaks these strict laws of causality when he sends the coordinates back in time to himself.  TARS and Cooper break it again when they send the quantum data back in time to Murphys watch.  This is a cause that occurs in the future that creates an effect in the past.  Causality goes both directions.  gtBut the whole problem is youre saying once they become D beings they just always were D beings and once they just always were D beings Youre just asking the same question over and over.  Its starting to get ridiculous.  I understand you dont find my answer very satisfying but that is my answer.  Reject it and move on it you want but quit asking it its bordering on trolling at this point. I am sorry you cant understand it.  Time is a spatial dimension where everything that has every happened is happening or will happen is occurring all the time all over this spatial dimension.  We clearly see the evidence for this when Coop is in the tesseract.  Everywhere he looks in all directions are different moments of time in Murphs bedroom.  He can travel to anyone of those moments.  Here there is no past present or future.  It is all laid wide open for a D being to walk along and visit. I dont think I ever said once they become you add the once and the become because youre still seeing time as just a line.  I am saying because time is a spatial dimension they always have been.  they dont have to become they already are. gtTheres nothing messy about it.What I find messy about it is that you have not clearly stated exactly what it is and you havent supported it with any evidence from the film. gtIts supported by the conversation Brand and Murphy had the fact that there is an emphasis in the movie about Murphys Law and the fact that it fits perfectly with the more obvious theory yours. Thats flimsy.  Its vague.  The conversation as I pointed out is not in any way indicative that there is a chance someone will spontaneously solve the equation which we know is unsolvable without information from inside a black hole purely by accident in some alternate reality.  Murphys law is applied several times throughout the movie.  It comes up later in dialogue and it is running beneath the surface throughout the movie.  Its not like it was brought up once and then dismissed giving it some additional significance that we have to solve or search for.  What else?  What other evidence for a multiverse reading?And how do these alternate universes or realities work? There must be billions and billions of versions where humans go extinct.  Which ones do they choose to save?  All of them? How do these alternate universes and realities work? From the movie we know you can send a gravitational pulse across dimensions I guess you can also send to other universes?,interstellar,cnakqej,1,t5_2w1k9

In his crazed narcissistic brain he had to kill Cooper make it look like an accident and then eventually Brand Rom and Mann would figure out the planet wasnt habitable he could blame it on KIPP and theyd all push on to Edmunds planet. He didnt necessarily want to kill Cooper but had to in order to cover his lies and complete the mission. From his point of view it was the only way to save the species besides telling the truth.  He even tells Coop while Cooper is thrashing on the ground breathing poisonous ammonia that he is going to complete the mission for you Cooper. Dick.

2974103,0,t3_2u8dzb,There are a few possibilities. One is that the universe is a closed timeloop. Meaning all times in the universe existed from its beginning therefore future Cooper already was in the wormhole right from the universes manifestation. As D D if we include time beings we are limited to perceiving time move in one direction when in reality all of time is moving in every possible direction always. This possibility sort of predestines Cooper as the one who sends the coordinates and might eliminate free will in the process. Another alternative is something I discuss in another thread.Its possible humanity survived the first time around without the wormhole and without ever visiting Gargantua. Maybe they figured out a way to beat blight or confer resistance to their crops against blight or built a dome or something to survive until they could figure out how to do this. Maybe most of humanity died in the process. Regardless enough humans survived to advance science to the point where eventually they evolve past the four dimensions we know. At that point they open the wormhole for themselves in the past perhaps to speed up the process of solving gravity so that not most of the humans on Earth would end up dying like they did the first time around. Just some possibilities. Its a great movie! ,interstellar,co6662p,5,t5_2w1k9

3762906,0,t3_33hv1h,There is a very convincing hypothesis that gravitation is the weakest of the four documented fundamental forces of nature the others being electromagnetism weak nuclear and strong nuclear if interested and therefore the argument is that it interacts so weakly because its fundamental particle the hypothetical graviton  never observed in nature so far spends most of its time in other dimensions and therefore interacts very weakly with this realm. You can loosely tie this in to the socalled many worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and one possible explanation is that gravitational waves possibly transcend time. Most likely this is a fancy scifi way of working around causality and making for a good story but as yet it is unconfirmed either way so even extreme scifi scrutinizers such as myself embrace it to make a good story... It could be true!I didnt read Kipp Thornes book yet but I think thats how he came up with the idea of interacting with the past.Personally I think theres some merit there but much more likely causality stands and these gravitons are bleeding in to the most compatible other universes in the multiverse the ones closest to our own in state. This negates any notion of time travel but still allows gravity to interact with the unseen and could be used as a hell of a device for a paranormal experience type of movie without violating knownphysics which is a huge deal for some diehard scifi fans like myself. Time travel almost certainly is fantasy. Otherwise paradoxes could be real. I just dont see that happening in a universe with such otherwise nearperfect order.Hope thats helpful.,interstellar,cql76uq,8,t5_2w1k9

TARS records and saves information from black hole. Cooper explains it to Murph. Using that data humans were eventually able to understand black holeswormholes. Since wormholes exist in futher dimensions beyond time humans create wormhole that will appear in the past.So theres really only one timeline where everything that has happened is happening and will happen are already decided. You cant change the past because it already happened so the future humans would have to make the wormhole in the past because it was there for them to use.  ,interstellar,ct5vpr3,2,t5_2w1k9

10825631,0,t3_5usus4,Its actually a bootstrap paradox not a predestination one but theyre all causal loops anyway. You go back in time and hand a collected dossier of Einsteins work to a young Einstein still starting out in physics. He essentially plagiarizes the stuff youve given and develops all his theories. Who wrote the original dossier? Not you you just bought it in a shop. Not Einstein since you gave him the dossier that led him to form all his theories. Information paradox.Its one of the lesser known paradoxes involving time travel the grandfather paradox being the one best known. ,interstellar,ddwl5tj,19,t5_2w1k9
11036963,0,t3_5xjqsp,Ok I looked it up they actually say the wormhole appeared  years ago and anomalies started about  years ago soooo maybe it appeared when Professor Brand was born? I dont know,interstellar,dej0qpb,2,t5_2w1k9
11092668,0,t1_deiyjdu,It was a matter of minutes. And if I remember correctly that was one of the things in the film they knew was scientifically inaccurate but wanted it in there for effect. In reality it is believed a passage though such a wormhole would be instantaneous. ,interstellar,depce4w,2,t5_2w1k9

11111840,0,t1_deqkzc9,I dont think Rom could have left them...there was no way for him to know whether or not they died and given the time dilation almost any scenario is plausible to explain their delay. Eventually he probably would have chosen to sleep in long stretches  years maybe...And I guess eventually he would have had to move on. ,interstellar,derinag,1,t5_2w1k9
