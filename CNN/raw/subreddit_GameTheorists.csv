When falling from extreme heights wind resistance always plays a major role even when the air is completely still.As I understand it human terminal velocity is about mph or about fts.  A magikarp has a difference shape so I cant say if their terminal velocity would be more or less but it would be reasonably close.Gforce does not matter quite so much when dealing with impacts.  The critical measurement is deceleration time how much time it takes for the kinetic energy of the projectile to be imparted into the target.The other concern is that the amount of energy in the impact is experienced by both the projectile and the target.  So unless you are using your magikarp in a sacrificial capacity it is entirely possible that this blow will be fatal to the goofy lookin water pokemon.,GameTheorists,cpoe9vx,6,t5_2ycad

I have an ultimate reason on why this makes sense.My theory is about the Dark Ages the time whenChristianity was most rapidly expanding. Have you ever wondered why we cant go to different Planets other than the ones directly by us? Its tied to the ways Greek myths spread. The reason why Greek myths could spread is because of another empire the Indians. The Greeks tried to invade multiple areas in Southern Asia but were stopped by the Indians because the had Elephants. Which in turn kept them contained and then the Romans Christians were responsible along with many other tribesempires for the fall of the Greeks. Could there be a force keeping the Darkness from spreading Possibly a symbol for the Indians? As well as a possible set up for a sequel.,GameTheorists,cpup265,2,t5_2ycad

Honesty is something else. Just because you have no problem that he hides his disclosure in the end of the video or in the description doesnt mean its an okay thing to do. Again there is no other reason to NOT put it in the beginning and be CLEAR about it other than the fear that people leave the video. Basicly the fear that being honest steals him minutes watched but thats the price you pay for making a sponsored video. MatPat is simply sneaking around his responsibility. Hiding it in a Block of Text is not proper disclosure even when its on top of the Block. And the disclosure at the end is especially handled in the FTC FAQ that its more likely to be missed.There were already people who got in trouble because they didnt disclose properly because it was no disclosure before consumer interaction with the material.

6417704,0,t1_czepgfc,Thank you for looking at the data! This is exactly it. I think its confirmation bias that prompts threads like this one but by looking at the data you see that things are largely the same. Ive always tried to maintain a balance between types of episodes.  ScienceIRL videos  LoreConspiracy videos MetaIndustry videosLike you pointed out the data has ALWAYS shown that viewers like the nd category the best  Link is Dead Mario is a Sociopath FNAF theories etc. so in the interest of appealing to most of the subscribers to the channel lately there may have been a few more of those. THAT SAID my THEORY is that its the algorithms affecting what you see. YouTube shares videos to more subscribers when they get more clicks in the first few hours after upload. As we just said the lore episodes get the most clicks. As such THOSE are the ones you see pop up the most frequently. Its a vicious cycle which skews your perception of the videos Im actually releasing when Ive tried to keep it balanced to appeal to as many people as possible. ,GameTheorists,czj4l0x,9,t5_2ycad

8108017,0,t3_4mj9zx,This theory doesnt work for a lot of reasons. If you research a little into Nastasias actual hypnosis as Im sure MatPat did you find that she hypnotizes five characters in the game a Koopa Troopa a Hammer Bro a Goomba Peach and Luigi.The enemies all immediately pledge loyalty to Count Bleck directly after being hypnotized. It can be argued that they would have pledged loyalty already but their loyalty to Bowser was stopping them so the hypnosis as presented in the theory would have applied.Peach however is a different story. She is hypnotized to do something very clearly against her will marry Bowser. Its also shown that it takes several bouts of hypnosis to make Peach say I do including Nastasias super hypnosis. This doesnt make sense for the suggestive hypnosis. What would make more sense is a fastacting educational hypnosis. Its clear that Peach is under distress as she is being forced to agree to marry Bowser. Essentially its just compounding the psychological distress of educational hypnosis into a few seconds.Luigi is therefore not evil. He was being forced against his will to fight his friends.,GameTheorists,d4rewsp,1,t5_2ycad

8675333,0,t1_d6q0h0a,Right and thats fine that you managed that. It does not change the fact that someone can upfront choose to spend a bunch of money and instantly have the same benefit with  hours played. Thats the problem.I dont care that items drop randomly.I dont care that there is a crafting system to mitigate the random drops. Actually i do care because thats a good fucking decision honestly..I dont care that theres trading to further mitigate the random drops. ... see previous point this is actually a good decision too.What I care about it giving people the ability to bypass all of that and give them a tangible advantage in time allotted with weapons and availability of weapons.Thats wrong. It hurts the players it hurts the game.,GameTheorists,d6q1fkv,1,t5_2ycad

9574510,0,t3_5bejcj,Animal Crossing is a game thats not really thought about in terms of theories. Everyone just seems to accept things as they are  which is why reading an indepth theory about it would be interesting. I like the idea of it being set in the past I never noticed the fact the TV shuts off at midnight. Its even set in a countryside town with a low population density which would work with that idea. Alien imagery  Gullivers UFO being the one Im most familiar with  doesnt necessarily have to be in the future. UFO conspiracy theories and hoaxes have been around with mediainfluenced popularity since... the late s. Just some stuff to think about to maybe get some ideas flowing. Id love to see what ideas come up. Especially if theres anything behind the whole solehumanamonganimals thing.,GameTheorists,d9t95gj,1,t5_2ycad
