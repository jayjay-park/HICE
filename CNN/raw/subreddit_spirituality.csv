I can think of some of the people you write about but if those people read it they probably wouldnt get that it was about them or would repost it saying this is so true! and then forget about it.You mention people who go through the motions but then say that change is about action. I think I understand who youre talking about. I have facebook friends who post cryptic or cheesysounding quotes and astrology predictions saying follow your bliss and live in the moment but not trying to explain what those words mean to them basically saying I GET IT AND YOU DONT!I believe you could expand on this a lot more and be clearer with examples and a conclusion about what we can do to avoid that trap and recognize those who may not be genuine which can discourage us from pursuing a path that looks similar to theirs. Right now this seems like it is meant to simply judge those who are not as wholesome as we are. Dont we want to see everybody as one?,spirituality,cev5mi2,1,t5_2qhc5

2870834,0,t3_2szip4,My mom had a very profound experience a few years back at a yoga retreat Kripalu. It was on the final day of a day deepbreathingmeditationyoga program. The instructor had had prepared them for the possibility of very intense reactions to what the class was going to be doing and then they began their deepbreathing very deep breaths as I understand it. After about  minutes my mom said that she felt like she was on a nearing a precipice and the teacher was urging everyone not to be afraid to go INTO and breathe through whatever fearshesitations their body might be giving them. So my mom continues to breathe deeply and sure enough she said she felt an allencompassing wave of joy come into her and come over her. She started crying tears of happiness and continued to simply bask in this incredible energy that enveloped her. She said it was one of the most beautiful experiences she has ever had.Even after it subsided she was left with an indelible sense of oneness and understood that there is truly nothing to fear. It sounds very similar to the aftereffects of a near death experience but she was able to access it simply by meditation and deepbreathing!Interestingly not all of the participants in the class had the same experience as she did. As the class winded down my mom noted several people crying with grief   in a place of deep sadness and mourning. It seems as if this exersise had released whatever old energies had been stuck deepdown for some people. But I think my mom had cleaned out her spiritual cobwebs and was able to connect directly with source!,spirituality,cnuexpz,3,t5_2qhc5

3615230,0,t3_31o7t2,I like to compare to music.. We are like tones in a grand polyrhythmic harmony... which makes us one song universe.. but not all the same notes.. we all resonate uniquely and some scales dont play well together while others do. As for notes going off key because other notes are playing in harmony Id put that in the category of ego or unconscious programming..Does harmony imply sexual relations? Potentially but not necessarily.. engaging in committed relationships with specific contracts enforcing boundaries in sexual connection with others seems totally reasonable in todays society... Attachment to seeing the beautiful harmonies move towards sexuality is your ego... I think it comes to the classic wisdom Be Here Now! .. enjoy the harmonies in presence.. let yourself go while embracing the gift of the ability to practice healthy discernment as for your contracts with others... you may need to reevaluate your contracts but you can certainly sing a wide variety of songs and are always One whichever way.Hope that helps.. this is something I had a lot of issues with growing up. Im now married with a baby which enforces certain obligations.. we have a great relationship and allow each other to dive in with other people and I love singing with others but sex would make things complicated so I dont sing those songs with others... we are certainly unified in spirit though.,spirituality,cq4d1u1,1,t5_2qhc5

4206934,0,t3_392aa5,I would suggest breaking everything down into really broad basic belief statements for now. Here are a few prompts for you       Do you believe in a God? What is your definition of God? Do you think the existence of a God makes any impact on your life?       What is your purpose on Earth? What would you like your purpose to be? What do you need to do to work towards that purpose?       Do you like what you believe? What does or doesnt jive with you? What do you wish you believed?       What core values are important to you? What do you admire in others and yourself?       Do you harbor guilt? Where does that guilt stem from? Does the source of that guilt fall in line with what you believe? What changes can be made to absolve the guilt?       What does love mean?       What does moving on or getting over it mean?       How do you feel about yourself? Do you love yourself? Do you despise yourself?        What does worthiness mean to you? What is your definition of good enough?       What do you think is important to celebrate?      Weve all been brainwashed in one way or another by our own environment. How we were raised provides the fuel for our ego to build the appropriate filters to make our minds more efficient. Its not a bad thing all the time but when you want to make a change in how you think of things overcoming the obstacles set forth by your established ego can be challenging. If you find this transition exceptionally difficult you may want to seek some form of counseling or mentorship to help you through. You may however find that switching over is as easy as turning a light on and off.      Empower yourself. You are in a wonderful position where you get to create the framework for your own spirituality. Dive into books meditate talk to yourself journal talk to friends talk to strangers really set yourself into a foundation and always return to it. Acknowledge that you will change your mind probably a lot and thats okay! This is an adventure you are discovering a brand new idea.      Breathe in some fresh air. Feel the sun on your skin. You exist and you can create whatever reality you wish. Discover what makes you happy ,spirituality,crzs1sf,6,t5_2qhc5

5829989,0,t1_cxjse6w,When I first saw him it was in a meditative state he was right in my face like a mirror was infront of me with an Insane wild look to him and a very demented grin on his face probably trying to scare me. which worked he never spoke upon our first meeting just stared observing me.  My second meeting was again through meditation same as the first time right up in my face grinning and with a piercing stare right through my eyes. He said something in a foreign tongue but my mind associated the words to mean I exist not only in you but in others lock me away and I will still find the cracks cracks will turn to gaps and soon Ill come out to play. His energy was draining to say the least after this specific meditation I stopped for a week as I was becoming drained and negative... Just like he said really...  The Third time was through a couple tabs of LSD I met him in abstract form almost like a fuzz of energy he had a magnetic pull as I got closer I felt a deeper feeling of doom I kept trying to pull away but every move I made in the other direction I felt weaker I muster up my courage and allow myself to be dragged infront of him I stare into the fuzz I feel many emotions at this point I couldnt explain fully but My emotions fluctuated  through them all in the matter of seconds which felt like forever. As I focused my eyes to the energy I saw what was a person who seemed very misunderstood This is all I really remember from the trip but I felt very connected after this journey.  My fourth time is when I saw multiple versions of myself including him through a meditative state. This was by far the most mind opening spiritual experience for me personally I entered a realm where not only did he exist but around  other mes existed split from one side to the other one side clearly had negative focus and the other positive. I saw my original shadow from the other  experiences. He looks to me with the same insane look but with a different twist this time I saw him and saw not only me but all versions of me. Like im the one scaring him in his mind. I took the opportunity to stand in the middle of the split and discuss my thoughts no side cared for the other side but both understood my purpose and respected that.   So now even today after many more times meeting with other versions of my self negative and positive they have always shown me a kind of love through respect of me showing understanding. I wish to talk to Him further and get to know him but he still remains with a insane look to him but now he sits beside me sometimes behind me and all I can feel is his presence. ,spirituality,cxju5o5,1,t5_2qhc5

In the past few years Ive cut out a whole bunch of people who were subconsciously bringing me down and I felt guilty about it at first but you owe it to yourself more than you owe anyone else your friendship! The one mistake I made however was the WAY in which I moved on from these people. As someone who hates confrontation I did the cowardly thing and I cut those people out of my life with no warning or conversation.. I basically ignored them until they got the message. Burned a lot of bridges. I would suggest having a conversation with this person or people saying that youre finding yourself in a situation or period of your life where you need to work on xyz.. and you need some space in order to do so.

In fact there are lot of beings who are in the inbetween unfortunately. Which doesnt help the spiritual war going on because they are going to have to choose a side anyway when good and evil truly clash together fullpower. And evil will not give you a choice.

7479351,0,t1_d2rifm5,Thank you for your reaction and Im glad that you could find yourself in my story! Yeah I know that the ego plays a huge part in growing and exepting things. Ive done allot of shrooms. The experiences I described above were the positive experiences but I have had way more negative ones. Everytime I take them they really make me uncomfortabble at first. And allmost everytime im at the point of losing it. But at the same time very good and positive things come from it too. I learn and grow from it allthough the experience got extremely scary at times. I really feel this world you get in is like I come in direct contact with the makeruniversegod. He makes me question reality. Makes me see that things are NOT as the seem. Its all an illusion. I dont know how to explain myself properly. But ive been there and ive known. I was in the know. Ive somehow lost allot from what I knew cause I took a step back from all of this allmost  years from now. Last year when I smoked my last joint ive stopped for over a year now shit happened to me that I wasnt ready for. I came into direct contact with my egomy subconsiosness. I saw it as a sphere that was stopping me from taking stepps forward. It pushed it away and felt like I was in controll again. I felt enormously ephoric a minute or so. I talked directly to the maker or so it felt. He reassured me that everything was going to turn out fine. All the troubles and worries that i had it was going to be oke. After that it all went wrong. It felt like that sphere that i pushed away that I made dissapear. It just completely took me over. It took over my mind! I lost it at that point. but all the while my breathing was very slow and controlled. There was this thing in my mind cant decribe it that I coudlnt controll. Like the ego wanted his control back. I was overcome with fear. because I didnt know what could happen. So the next couple of months I suffered from anxiety and a sleeping disorder and all kinds of shit. So I went to the docter and of course he said it was come kind of hyperventilationpsychosis. But I know that it wasnt. It felt like something else. Soo being in school which suffered greatly in these months I decided to let it all go. It really was like living in a hell those months. Friends tell me I should really do LSD but as you may understand Im scared to do it. Scared to be in that world again.So yeah Ive done quite some meditation but i really never could find that peace in my mind. This inner me is always looking for distraction of some sort.

7873396,0,t3_4mt3rf,The guide you posted is a good starting point. Touch is a good way to evoke an emotional response and there is nothing wrong with enjoying the people around us. I do feel that I can further provide information to help people love. I posted this on another thread and felt that it has merit in being discussed here as well. Love is an emotion. When people love throughout their lives they raise their consciousness and ability to ascend within the light. You further your own spiritual progression through the act of love. Loving creates positive karma as it is considered a moral emotion by the eyes of the light. The light is an infinite energy source that spirits reside in. It is where we go after physical death. Karma is very much a part of the light. Love can feel like a warm fuzzy energy coming from the heart area or heart chakra. Its a soft kind of energy most people feel towards the true loves of their life but its something in which we can do at will through enough practice. We are partially cut off from the light because of the physical bodies we inhabit so those who love daily on the incarnate plane spiritually progress at such a rapid pace because of the circumstance of their lives. In that we do not get the luxury of remembering who we are or having the full information of karma while on the incarnate plane. This creates a potential training ground in physical life where every karmic reaction to our action is multiplied by a certain amount depending on the circumstances. Where a certain action down here is worth way more karma than that similar action within the light. Those who love daily or promote morality spiritual progress to very high planes within the light after death. Your soul color or aura color changes depending on which plane your karmic progress reflects.A note on lust Love should not be mistaken with lust. Lust is an unclean sexual emotion that is often times implanted towards incarnates from spirits. Its an intense carnal desire during intimacy. When we lust we lose spiritual progress. It is considered to be a negative emotion. In most incarnate relationships lust is involved. The act of intimacy itself is not immoral but emotions being used throughout it can be. Those who love during intimate moments often times feel spiritual clean afterward. That is because they united with loving moral energies and progressed spiritual through the act of intimacy. Be careful when you feel lust and make sure to reject that feeling during intimate momentsI practice something called Heart Charka Radiance which is aimed towards teaching people to love. A former teacher of mine taugh me these modes some time ago.Mode  While breathing normally visualize a sphere of white energy in your chest or more specifically in your Heart Chakra  the most important chakra for spiritual growth. Then without holding your breath visualize radiating white light out of this sphere in every direction at once. It is suggested that one first use this technique in light alpha meditation in order to become accustomed to it.Mode  While visualizing Mode  program yourself simply through desire to radiate those aspects of spiritual white light  called Programmed White Light  that would help you grow in the fastest possible way. Once you start doing this the improvement is immediate and requires no new concentrated effort you improve as you use it.Mode  This is a natural evolution from the previous modes. Through the application of mode  it is eventually realized when the will alone is sufficient to radiate visualizing is no longer necessary because a certain degree of proficiency has been developed.Mode  Because of the difficulty in visualizing this this mode is not recommended until Mode  is performed fairly easily. With the Heart Chakra being the primary focus radiate as you would from Mode  with all of the seven major chakras  all at the same time.The methods of heart chakra radiance are there to eventually allow someone to be able to love at will without visualizations meditations or a catalyst. Where you would be able to use will and intention to love without the need of imagination. Where you would reach a point in your practice where you would be able to love towards anyone through the use of will and intention with the need to be in a meditative state. Where you would be able to love daily without haveing to use a catalyst which evokes love someone who you love with all of your heart a true love.I usually picture white light coming from where my heart is located. It is advised to use Heart Chakra Radiance in a meditative state during first attempts. Visualizing white light emanating from your heart chakra is the first step. If you are having difficulty with the listed visualization you can try envisioning white light radiating like a stream advancing from your heart outwards in front of your body. They may seem complicated at first but through visualization meditation and practice you can achieve the emotion of love.The visualizations are there to provoke a loving response. once you start to understand the emotion of love you can radiate that emotion at will through intention.Do not be alarmed if you can not feel that love right away. Certain people sometimes need to develop their emotions before they can clearly feel them. Daily use of HCR naturally leads you to be able to feel loving emotion from your heart more clearly. Keep in mind that lower elements of the spirit realm like to suppress our emotions so that we can not clearly feel it leading us to sometimes we can become dissuaded into not loving daily which ultimately hinders karmic progress. There may be times when you are actually loving but are being supressed to the point of not being able to fee that loving output. This works both ways though there may times when you feel that love crystal clear which is an indication that higher realm spirits are amplifying your love.Once you start to develop the ability to feel the love you are radiating out and understand it more clearly you can start to radiate different type of love. CompassionLoving Care HappinessJoyous love Humilityselfless love InspirationMotivational Love PuritySensual Love HeroismLoving Courage.You can send love towards physical people as well as spirits. Loving towards your guides creates a closeness between you. It is my understanding that most incarnates do not feel the emotions you send towards them but they will experience those emotions once they pass on. Aiming where you love is done through intention. If you intend to love towards the person that is sitting next to you that is what will happen. that intention will send that love towards them.In regards to the th mode listed up above Using the first three modes in the context of radiating energy from all Chakras at once. The visualizing involved in trying to do this can be overwhelming. Try attempting a couple of Chakras at once in conjunction with the heart Chakra before doing them all at once. After you become used to doing so add more charkas as you practice. The difference between working on other chakras energies and that of the heart Chakra is the emotional difference. You will not usually feel emotion emanating from other chakras. Many people have difficulty at first discerning the energy coming from the other six Chakrasor other chakras should you subscribe to the thoery that there are more than six you will not usually feel emotions coming from them. It can feel like an energized pressure instead. You At first you might not be able to feel the energy coming from your Chakras. This may be due to blockages or spiritual influences around you. Keep working on it though as these blockages are usually not permanent and actually can be unblocked by radiating from that specific chakra. So Heart Chakra Radiance is you sending loving energies out of your th chakrait dictates soul growth but radiating energies out of your other chakras also develops corresponding spiritual senses that you use when you are within the light that you would not notice down here. Imagine being able to play a video game or a board game in which allowed you to develop physical senses while playing them should you do a certain action. In the context of the spirit realm this is similar to how the incarnate plane can be used in regards those radiating energies out of their chakras. The Incarnate plane is essentially a place in which we can hone our spiritual senses. IE Radiating energy out of your third eye furthers spiritual sight. Those who radiate energy out of the third eye for a lengthy period of time in their physical life experience heightened spiritual sight when they hit the light after death. Those who work on it during their lives notice a massive difference when they pass on. Metaphorically the comparison between someone who does not work on it and someone who does would be the equivalent of comparing the sight of a human and that of an eagle when those people return to the light. I am still learning about what senses are tethered to which chakra but here are some examples IE Radiating energy out of the crown chakra increases thought capacity. IE Radiating energy out of the Solar Plexus helps with willpower. IE Radiating out of the Sacrel helps with white light manipulation. Try working on Heart Chakra Radiance. The closeness of a spiritual relationship benefits from love as it creates an unbreakable bond that ties you together. That bond continues to strengthen the more you send that person love or positive emotions. This does not necessarily have to be intimate in nature. Platonic love exists. The love of friendship and family should not be understated. You may have a difficult time understand the full benefits of loving towards those you have a relationship but I can guarantee that you will not regret such action once you pass on from this life.,spirituality,d411j4k,1,t5_2qhc5

10738179,0,t3_5t1oup,Yes agree. There is just one great paradox ! which is that if one does not seek enlightenment at all meaning one has no interest or no intention to awaken whatsoever the process doesnt go anywhere usually.Perhaps we should think of it as en evolution where a person begins to wonder whats beyond the ego and all its limitations and initially begins to seek. Then when the intention is strong enough the person discovers that it requires true selftranscendence and hopefully is able to make that switch seeing that the very ego activity of search is what has to be overcome. Often this is a reason why people seek the advice or company of an already awakened teachermaster. So even though a person started of with a false assumption that seeking enlightenment is possible for an ego it does eventually lead somewhere when this error is recognized.  ,spirituality,ddnk8w7,1,t5_2qhc5

10973242,0,t3_5wopfp,I think weed turns down the analytical side of the brain to bolster the emotional side of the brain creating feelings not felt when sober. Im of the belief that all the emotions need to be understood for what they are and if there are emotions acting within a persons unconscious mind then those emotions must be brought to conscious awareness. Meditation can easily achieve this but it takes becoming good at relaxing before results are seen. So drugs are worthless in light of the benefits of meditation. But drugs like LSD DMT or Shrooms can be life changing and completely spiritual experiences. All the existential woes and insights gained from these drugs can be attained with meditation as well. I have gone through the ascetic path and came out of it more tuned in with what it meant to be balanced more tuned into everything and I was more concentrated in meditation than i was when i was smoking drinking and not being celibate. Youre body is a chemistry set that produces energy and is always seeking a balance If you feed it right treat it right and you let yourself naturally find balance then you grow naturally.

From their research as well as my own theyve found that truth makes your body go strong while falsehood or nontruth makes your body go weak. The method they suggest using involves the deltoid muscle of a testing partner making a statement such as love is healthy. then telling them to resist as you press down on their arm.

Look up why it is called a called a yellow dwarf and youll learn it is because of its temperature and mass  not apparent color. This is such a prime example of the nature of belief and how beliefs are so unreliable. The sun has been depicted and perceived as yellow in our culture. It is white and always has been white. Maybe you perceived it as yellow as a child because it was depicted as yellow and at times you saw that it was yellow when it was setting. Thats a problem with perceptions also  theyre unreliable as well. Its up to you to prove it and Im sure there is a lot of information out there about measurements of the suns color so go talk to any astronomer. Why do you want to believe this? Whats the point? It serves no purpose except if you were to admit youre wrong and learn from it and understand how we are wrong about so many of our beliefs. You holding on to this is exactly what the ego does with all of its beliefs that it thinks it knows but doesnt know. It only believes it knows and most of our beliefs are formed by so many biases that most of them are likely to be incorrect.

It would be more accurate to derive the theory of everything from the point of view of simultaneity thus adding the fourth dimension of being and thinking into the mix.You mentioned circle in your theory which is a two dimensional projection of a sphere.  Sphere in theory is made out of infinite amount of circles so a circle of life no matter how big it is is only a part of life which is spherical in third dimensional thinking. Now a four dimensional complete form has to include infinite amount of spheres in it and in that regard linearity is no longer applicable to it and thus this kind of being and thinking is no longer bound by time which makes reality much clearer. In other words the real truth of things goes outside of capability of human thought.Concerning your comments on I think therefore I Am. The reason you did not recall thinking during your operation is because you did not recall thinking. The access to the memory is simply blocked in your mind. Most likely you were in a dream state during that time thinking in one way or another.,spirituality,dfpy00t,1,t5_2qhc5
11595975,0,t1_dgab4me,If I needed you to clarify this for me then I would be worried my path was untrue.  There are many paths to the divine.  I dont doubt the teachings I have received and lived through meditation or synchronicity.If I am being deceived then it is by a presence or presences whether fragmented into more individual versions of that presence that are benevolent loving and kind.I appreciate your concern.  I only looked to offer a pathway based on my experience.  Which has been all over the roadmap for over a decade but clear and quite imaginative at times and quite breathtakingly incredible sometimes like rapture or remembering gratefully something that I believed once was lost and return to each day.Now do I think I can connect deeply to the one true source every day?  No.  If and when it has happened it has been rare on occasion.  I am cautioned that it is important I remain aware on Earth this is where my lessons are to be learned.I appreciate your knowledge regarding Gnostic it will be interesting to read about and validate what Ive experienced.,spirituality,dgaeult,1,t5_2qhc5

11671157,0,t1_dgh8lgu,I see youve quoted Meher Baba. Lovely.Im sure you already know that Meher Baba is considered to be an incarnation of God just like Sai Baba Jesus Buddha Krishna etc. Where I come from both Sai Baba and Meher Baba are known as Datta Avatars or incarnations of the Supreme Lord Dattatreya known also as the Father of Heaven in Christianity. And I have immense love for them both who are one and the same.Im saying this because my Satguru spiritual preacher is part of the Datta Sampradaya tradition and a Datta Avatar Himself. He is a living embodiment of truth and I consider it my greatest fortune in life to be associated with Him. Much peace and love.,spirituality,dgixwm4,2,t5_2qhc5

Some of us have been awakened a long long time ago and so we have been doing the work. Reading the books trusting becoming more loving more service to others. Meditating everyday for like an hour. meditation is the key. it changes consciousness as all the noise and distractions from the mind control is neutralized.  Instead of questioning what we see maybe you could consider asking yourself why dont I see? Have you read the books...Im talking many. have you meditated for years? Blessings. ,spirituality,dgww2o1,2,t5_2qhc5
