10133008,0,t3_5kzvm1,Teams are actually increased in level at Master rank. Im in a Facebook group and one of our members ran into another member on defense. The defending players team had their levels artificially inflated from the high slow s into the s. So basically Ludia just decided they wanted fewer people able to make Master League.,tmntlegends,dbsc47b,3,t5_3f9cn
10238752,0,t3_5meft5,My game is pretty unstable and crashes randomly on both Android and IOS. The crash will happen one of three ways Midbattle game abruptly crashes to home screen. I used to think it was specific movescut scenes that triggered this but its random. Sometimes it will happen when the characters are running from one battle to another. Midbattle game will lag characters will continue to perform their idle animations but they wont attack. I can toggle the speed and autoplay buttons but they dont do anything. Pressing the pausemenu button causes the game to crash to home screen. Midbattle game freezes then EVERYTHING disappears from the screen except for the gradient background the flat colors behind the buildings and trees. The game stays like this until I force quit.Additionally on Android the game occasionally crashes on loading. Once this glitch happens it will keep crashing each time I load until I restart my device.If Im in the middle of a battle on either OS and I need to switch to another app check messages or whatever the game will softreset when I go back to it losing my progress. If Im on the news page or one of the other menus roster shop mission etc. before I switch apps the game reopens normally.Honestly I wouldnt even care about all of this crashing except that each time the game crashes it puts my units on cooldown. This past week I finished the Swift and Spirit challenges with about k points and I would have easily cleared  if my best units werent constantly greyed out. Other glitchesEver since the last update every time I load the game on IOS I get this message Regrant failed. Please purchase the software application first.I have no clue what this is referring to. I have not purchased any packs. I do have a subscription and I got the message both before and after buying that. Oh the Humanity challenge Cant select toon Casey or Shredder. Casey is obtainable through the challenge so hes probably meant to be playable. Shredder who knows. It sure would be nice if we could use him since April is the only healer in the current roster.Graphical glitch when opponents use their special attacks the models are always flipped during the cut scene. Pulverizer and the classic turtles end up with backwards lettering on their belts and it looks kind of ugly.Finally I dont know if this is a glitch or not but when Gauntlet opponents use VQ Leos move they still get two turns of armor. Maybe this is the intention but honestly I think Ludia just forgot to update the effect. ,tmntlegends,dc4mbp3,3,t5_3f9cn
10483481,0,t3_5q0ul7,Wow thats totally unacceptable. If Ludia really cant restore your account fair compensation would be one Gold pack for every gold card you lost one Silver pack for every silver card you lost. ,tmntlegends,dcwet22,1,t5_3f9cn
10705419,0,t1_ddk6eer,Im pretty sure  its every time and this event will only be around Valentines day or for a stretch sweetest day.,tmntlegends,ddk6n56,1,t5_3f9cn
11126684,0,t1_det5t8z,Oh wow! Hope its not too bad!,tmntlegends,det77si,1,t5_3f9cn
11231614,0,t3_600bqs,Nice but sure the opponents will be stronger than our weakness characters cant play execpt if we level up them lol.,tmntlegends,df53739,1,t5_3f9cn
11550976,0,t3_64sl3x,My big concern right now is that Ludia will sunset this game. A lot of game and the assets theyre using are based on the current toon and if they have a new toon they would have to figure a way to work the new material in at a basic level for the newer players coming to the game because of the new toon.Hopefully they wont sunset the game as its a Legends game which most games use to indicate that theyll use any version of the franchise but its a definite possibility. The thing is Ludia wont say a word until theyre ready to close this game because they know we wont spend and will play less if we knew this game had an expiration date.,tmntlegends,dg5b1dt,2,t5_3f9cn
11746551,0,t1_dgr2mgg,I could be persuaded to move Movie Casey up. He was bugged for a long time which made him nearly unusable Ive think I heard at one point or another he was fixed but I never cared to check.,tmntlegends,dgri20m,1,t5_3f9cn
11801187,0,t3_6899au,I built up a pretty large stockpile a while ago but with Pizza Face gone Ive become pretty reluctant to spend it. It makes it difficult to farm for ability upgrades.,tmntlegends,dgxpenp,1,t5_3f9cn
