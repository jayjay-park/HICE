9902463,0,t1_dax8hxu,Being uncertain of my direction was the main intention of posting. I am definitely interested in cloud computing and IoT but would like to strengthen skills in Linux Python MySQL and nGinx before attempting to land a job working with these technologies. I realize your field is a niche but would you as a hiring manager look upon a Tier  job as a positive for moving into a role with more responsibility? I can describe my role in more detail if need be. ,cscareers,daybb8l,1,t5_3bg15
11405754,0,t3_62q4tu,My advice would depend on what sort of jobs you see yourself looking for in the future.Are you looking to be a cog either a coding cog or a more managerial cog in a welloiled and large programming team? This large team will likely be split up into multiple smaller teams. This type of role would be a large consulting firm or a Google Microsoft or Facebook style company.Or are you looking to be a part of a small but skilled team working in one of the companies that is the lifeblood of our economy the world over? Think of companies that employ  people here where software development is an important part of how the company delivers what they deliver but without being everything they do. A retail company with an eCommerce arm would fit this type as would a charity or local government or a warehousing operation that has IT needs.Or are you after the high stakes high risk high pressure environment of a startup working hard in a small team trying to outrun dwindling finances knowing that if you get your app or service out in front of the right people youll hit it big and safeguard your financial future? Pick any startup du jour or the earlydays Facebook and youll have an idea of what company this refers to.Would you prefer a small lifestyle company? These companies generally support the owners while providing jobs for a very small number of people. Theyre not looking to make billions and what they really want is one or two people who are able to provide any and all ITprogramming needs that they may have. They may grow at some point in the future organically but in general as long as everyone gets paid is happy and gets along with each other and their clients the owners are content.Realistically youll be looking for a combination of companies from the above. Additionally what youll want to work on to build up a portfolio that will get you interviewed and then accepted when you do go for a job with them will be different. Let me know what youre thinking of in the future and Ill offer some more specialised advice.,cscareers,dfott2c,2,t5_3bg15
