817918,0,t1_cgx2mxd,If this is it and I bet it is go to settings gt data usage and change the data usage cycle so that it starts today. It used to work. I havent tried it in a while though.,StraightTalk,cgx90ev,2,t5_2y5ia
843938,0,t3_23s6s2,I just bought a s off craigslist and my daughter is using it with straighttalk.  We looked for an att phone to go with the sim I already had.  I did Check the IEMI at  to make sure as much as I could that it wasnt stolen or blacklisted.  All was good,StraightTalk,ch07jjh,2,t5_2y5ia
1272579,0,t3_28nfvk,Maybe because the regular ST plans dont have international calling and the  is the country code for the US and is not needed... Just my guess. ,StraightTalk,cics64e,1,t5_2y5ia
2055638,0,t1_cktqcvh,can I do the same with verizon to atampt. I have a verizon phone but I am going to upgrade to an atampt phone so do i just transfer service to my new phone. My new phoneOne plus One is also not on the straight talk shop so it would be a byop.,StraightTalk,cl147s9,1,t5_2y5ia
2409047,0,t3_2l0tfr,My first  months with StriaghtTalk and atampt sim they didnt throttle me and I would tether to my android tablets all the time never to my macbook or PC. Back in July I traveled to San Francisco Im in Texas and got the data limit text not even  minutes after landing I was at .GB. Now whenever I hit GB I get throttled.  I guess I was flying under the radar for those first months and system finally caught up to me.,StraightTalk,cm9gtqw,2,t5_2y5ia
4650354,0,t3_3elrzo,Id guess youll have to buy the cdma sim and network access code and then transfer your number from your GSM linesim with no service to your new CDMA sim via the transfer your straight talk number option. I did the same thing. I had a Verizon phone I tried to access with a GSM sim I bought from them with no luck. Did you try to do it all online? Honestly Ive had better luck calling them and having a person do it all for me over the phone.,StraightTalk,ctgqm5p,1,t5_2y5ia
4693685,0,t1_ctm60hp,Yeah neither is mine. Its a verizon galaxy s which I rooted and updated myself with safestrap. Theres not a bit of ST branding or software on this phone. ,StraightTalk,ctm6hwf,1,t5_2y5ia
5751826,0,t3_3ttei4,Complain on social media You can also try this number  Im not sure that number is as good as it used to be because a year or so ago Id get an immediate answer by someone who would quickly fix my problems when other reps just did nothing or made it worse. I dont think its the same today. ,StraightTalk,cxa2i39,1,t5_2y5ia

7857879,0,t3_4mx72u,You need an Straight Talk Sim from ST that works on the Verizon network. They sell them at Walmart in the ST starter kit.  Your Verizon one will not work.,StraightTalk,d3zaok1,1,t5_2y5ia

9234821,0,t3_56suok,if youre gonna use verizon towers youre gonna have to buy a verizon phone.  but just so you know ive had problems and other people here have had problems getting their verizon s to work on ST.  if it doesnt work you can always get an ATT sim and it will work.  verizon phones are factory unlocked. ,StraightTalk,d8mkxnl,1,t5_2y5ia
9854991,0,t1_darwc7a,Maybe I think Verizon has extra hoops to jump through even if it is unlocked.  I.e. if you still owe money on it you cant activate it through straight talk.  Not  sure what all the requirements are though.,StraightTalk,das4mgi,2,t5_2y5ia
