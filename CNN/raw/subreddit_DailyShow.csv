This has become a chance for the republicans to change the narrative and blame any poor responses they had on CNBC and not on the reallife circumstances that made that question a reality. Carson wasnt made to answer for his scam medical company associations. Trump wasnt actually pressed for details about his Mexican Paid for Wall. And now they can pretend those issues were created by the liberal media hitmachine. The second part of this is portraying the dem debate as a lovefest. Which TDS showed it obviously wasnt.

Because it took years for Jon and co. to tailor the show perfectly to Jons style. This stuff takes time you cant expect a new host to come in without there being some hitormiss experimentation to find out what still works and what needs to be revamped.  And for what its worth Jon has a pretty high opinion of Trevor himself. He thought Trevor was so talented that he personally called him and offered him a job at TDS years ago  no audition required. As it happens he was in the middle of a stand up tour at the time so he couldnt accept the job Give the guy some time hes the real deal. So is Amy Schumer for that matter.Yeah I said itkinda reminds me of a good quote...gtWhen Thomas Jefferson succeeded Franklin as ambassador to France in  French Foreign Minister Vergennes asked It is you who replace Dr. Franklin?

People still love Stephen but I think wethey love his perspective and comedic voice more. I feel his voice doesnt come out too often on The Late Show.On a somewhat related note I have my own personal theories regarding a possible drinking problem which may be contributing to his behavior and the direction of the show.

9897687,0,t1_dawyio2,Thank you for clarifying. I dont personally believe in categorical claims like all legal immigrants feel that way. I dont even know the actual numbers since I doubt they did scientific polling on that question. I think this is more of a conceptual argument. Any rational person can acknowledge that there is currently a waiting list set of criteria you must satisfy and money paid to legally immigrate to the USA.  To grant a pass to people who want to cut in line there is a queue and not have them pass any of our standards or rules it undermines our laws and is a huge slap in the face for people doing it the right way.  It effectively disinsentivizes people from following our immigration laws which is a dangerous precedent.Noah tries to come off as calm and ethically superior while touting the tired poor hungry yearning to be free line but it ignores her entire argument These people are specifically cutting in line not paying not satisfying the conditions of citizenship and breaking our laws to do so. We are already seeing what happens when this runs rampant in sanctuary cities in particular. We saw people who tout allegiance to Mexico waving their Mexican flag and causing violence at political rallies towards others for merely wanting to assert our own sovereign laws. Whats craziest of all is not only the lack of sympathy in the news for people who want to have a rational discussion about border security theyre getting called racists as well. Meanwhile we have actual people who are not supposed to be here threatening and attacking citizens who merely want to address this issue. Literally this fits the definition of terrorism. Violence or intimidation in pursuit of political ends is pretty much the textbook definition.Basically this isnt an issue of the numbers who believe they got cheated which many definitely are. This is a primary issue of if we should even bother enforcing our laws at all. I think everyone who supports illegals needs to take a hard look at  U.S. Code    Bringing in and harboring certain aliens Many universities are blatantly violating this.,DailyShow,daxoxbq,1,t5_2qlhz

11273805,0,t1_df8aalt,I think the idea is mildly similar to selfdefense. Heres a kind of shitty example for clarificationIf you agree to let someone rent a room in your house then you cant just one day kill them in selfdefense as if they broke in. Even if you realize after the fact that it was a mistake theres been an agreement made and you have to honor it. You knew at the time of signing the rental agreement that things might not work out but as long as they hold up their end you cant just kick them out without good reason and you certainly cant remove them violently. Similarly if you have unprotected sex or sex using a form of contraception that you know is not  effective then you understand that you are risking getting pregnant. Even if you decide you dont want the child once youre pregnant the agreement has been made. If you get pregnant as a result of being raped this is equivalent to someone breaking into your house forcing you to sign a rental agreement under duress drugging you in order to get you to sign the contract etc. In this case the agreement was either never made or is clearly not valid as you did not actually agree to it with sound mind and so you have every right to remove the person from your house by any means necessary.Incest or complication with a pregnancy that put the mothers help in danger are similar as well. This is equivalent to the renter starting set stuff on fire punch holes in the wall smear shit all over the place or any other form of destruction. In these cases while the agreement may have been valid at the beginning the renter is now violating their end and is damaging your house and putting you in danger. The agreement is no longer valid and thus you again have every right to remove the person from your house by any means necessary.This isnt a perfect analogy though I am actually a bit surprised by how well it fits and Im not prolife but I dont think being prolife and believing in exceptions is anymore logically inconsistent than being against violence but believing in selfdefense.,DailyShow,df9vb2s,1,t5_2qlhz
