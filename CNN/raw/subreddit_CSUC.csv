2490803,0,t3_2o3k4v,Most people dont end up going to multiple  year schools. That being said when I was in the army Id go down to Florida Gators and party at that school. Holy hell the entire town was a party. Every time there was a sports game especially football the entire town would shut down to party. They had a drunk bus free that would pick people up from the bars and take them back to the major apartmentdorm complexes. Chico could really learn a thing or two about that They had specials that were as good or better than Chicos in terms of drinks. Dollar night was common at numerous bars. Lots of wrist bands that got you into  bars for one cover charge. Huge house parties with kegs that would take up an entire street. Granted the population of the area was higher in terms of students so its expected to have more but the whole scene was expected for parties so the city handled it so much better than how Chico does. Chico State is a party school but the city council and school administrators are stuck in s mentality and still love towing cars arresting people for being drunk in public and still havent implemented a drunk bus idea. That last part really blows me away. ,CSUC,cmjopp5,2,t5_2spca

11115361,0,t3_5ycymb,If youre bringing a car pay attention to street signs downtown that tell you Main and Broadway are oneway. Every semester its obvious who the newbies are when theyre headed south on Main on north on Broadway.Get yourself a solid bike if you dont have one already. Take some time to slow down and enjoy the park and other natural areas.Checkout Bidwell Perk. Great coffee shop chill owners and employees plenty of offstreet parkingbike lockups.If you get here early enough in the summer maybe take in a Heat game at Nettleton.Grab a burrito from Aca Taco on Nord or a cheeseburger from Nobbys on Park Ave.Check out the Observatory in Upper Park. Theyre usually open ThursSun during the summer months its something different to do.Remember that the party townparty school image is  years old and dying more every day dont fall into the trap of thinking that all there is to do here is drink and party. Theres  people in this town and plenty of them have fun doing things that dont involve booze.Try to remember that Chico is more than the campus and the neighborhoods that surround it.Be respectful of the locals they were here before you and theyll be here long after you leave so make decisions that wont negatively affect them even if you might not be here to see it.Enjoy it! Its a great little city.,CSUC,derx0qv,5,t5_2spca
