7115160,0,t3_4cz5r7,gt Why is minecraft soo poorly optimizedTo my knowledge its because it started as a crappy side project thats since been extended and augmented with things layered on top of it.gt and what is holding Mojang back?Guessing its the community surrounding whats there now crossplatform an awkwardly small development team and mods.  Check out how quickly the Windows  beta edition generated chunks.  But as the name suggests the Windows  edition... requires Windows .  Its based off the Mobile Edition codebase.Nobody wants to rewrite it if whats there is good enough.And if they did mods which are a huge part of the way many people play the game would almost certainly stop working and it would be nontrivial to rewrite them.  This is one major reason why people want an official modding API  that way Mojang can rewrite whatever the heck they want with their sweet sweet Microsoft cash money and as long as they keep the modding API stable mods will work like a charm.gt I have a feeling if I left it there someone would just simply reply JavaAs umpasteven alluded to Java is not the central issue.  There are plenty of JVM flags you can run Minecraft with that combined minimize nearly all the problems intrinsic to Java.gt if you are uptodate on your client you now enjoy multithreading which is a huge a huge bonus but then just kneecapped by the fact that we still are only using  of your GPUs and still lagging for some reason with the GPU being the bottleneck.Is that true?  Whenever Ive had actual performance issues in Minecraft I slap WarmRoast onto it and the bottleneck always seems to be chunk generation.As for multithreading part of the problem with running a singleplayer Minecraft world seems to be that the server ticks and client ticks happen at the same time.  Whenever Ive had performance issues with Minecraft Ive always been able to improve things significantly by simply running a server locally and connecting to it from the client.,CodePerformance,d1mwihk,6,t5_3deor

7302269,0,t1_d27rrxl,Good point although I think theres probably quite a bit of code like that these days due to nodejs and Go.,CodePerformance,d287vow,1,t5_3deor
