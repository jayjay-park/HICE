2652348,0,t3_2ollgx,In the end you will anyway have to deal with an agent. I would suggest you to submit a request to tsn.spb.ru with the desired parameters for the flat and expect calls from the agents. This website works with estate agencies checks if they are real and signs a contract with them before giving them access to their database. If you like the apartment expect to pay  month rent say   bond equals to  month rent eg   fee to the agent  of the month rent. Ask landlord to split the bond for  months. This way you will pay first month only  for the flat plus  for bond plus  to the agent. You usually pay utility bills next month to cover the previous one when you started to use water etc. Always ask to make a contract!! Before signing it ask the ownership docs from the landlord. It should be a certificate with the government number full address size etc of the flat name of your landlord date of birth and important! the part of the flat that he owns. It should be full ownership! Contract should also include conditions for cancellation normally one month notice for both sides with NO fees monthly price the amount of bond conditions for utility bills payment paying yourself or giving money to the landlord statement that the flat is not leased or sold a period say first three days of the month when the landlord can bother you to get money. Another important paper is the list of payments where u put the dates amount of money and their purpose u give to the landlord with your and his signature. Every paper should be in dublicate.  ,SPb,cn4sjii,2,t5_2siiu
