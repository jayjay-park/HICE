6645853,0,t1_d04hehb,tldr is I forked it because I wanted to do a handful of things differently the way logging works.  After that I just kept adding things to my fork.  The meat and bones are the same but there are lots of obscure and nifty additions in Binjitsu.  Diffing the projects is probably your best bet.In terms of sheer commits from github.combinjitsubinjitsu This branch is  commits ahead  commits behind Gallopsledmaster.  A significant quantity of those commits are features backported to pwntools.,securityCTF,d06qm8d,1,t5_2u0v2

10158097,0,t1_dbvbe41,gt So if we win some random noname indian CTF and never play again we will be top ? Sure this sounds so much better D DSure. Dont really care. gt If people want to play why would you restrict this?Because its exploitation. Theres a reason real sports dont just allow anybody to create new leagues and have  games a year. Thatd be exploitation of the players. Computery people tend to be elitist and create uselessly stressful environments as they devote their free time to things like CTFs and Hackathons. Without some sort of limitation all thats really doing is allowing exploitation and having businesses profit. ,securityCTF,dbvh6cd,1,t5_2u0v2
