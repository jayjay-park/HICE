I believe the science of happiness holds both spending time in nature and physical exercise to be great ways to improve ones happiness and ones happiness set point if done regularly. Hmm. Meditation journaling... which things that make us happier could be worked in? Ill reread Lukeprogs essay and get back to this. ,LessWrong,chteoxf,1,t5_2rmzm
1529900,0,t1_cj81gut,I guess I didnt get my point across well then. Im saying that given the trustworthiness of a duplicate being as concerned with one as you are with yourself is the natural conclusion of cooperation. If I were less concerned with the duplicate than with myself then he would likewise be less concerned with me than with himself and therefore we would both end up less welloff the long run.,LessWrong,cj81t75,1,t5_2rmzm

2265146,0,t3_2l5air,I would imagine it depends on what sort of career youre aiming for outside of the political work. Im sure there are lots of positions where you could count that as relevant experience. And im not sure how much damage it could do to have a little bit of notrelevant experience.Vague broad advice because I dont actually know much of anything on the subject undergraduate but I noticed noone had commented yet and figured I could provide a jumpingoff point,LessWrong,clrowv4,2,t5_2rmzm
3685662,0,t1_cqb5pr2,Thats fair. I guess there are two ways of thinking about it  on the one hand these people are already posthuman. They are the result of radical changes that they presumably enjoy so why should they necessarily be against another radical change? Getting rid of pain seems like not such a bad thing.But maybe even though they are completely different from what humans were before they would still resist become something different from what they are now.I think both ways of thinking are pretty plausible and it might depend on the specifics of the culture in question.,LessWrong,cqce1th,2,t5_2rmzm
4771437,0,t1_ctvsjl4,Why would you claim that one of those scenarios is more likely than the other?  What evidence is there that an AI attempting to insure its existence is the more likely scenario?Also of course they are opposite.  I was pretty clear that one requires action toward creating AI and the other requires action toward preventing AI.  Those are perfectly opposed.,LessWrong,ctvzdl6,1,t5_2rmzm
