Then tell him to get you the refrigerant off the data tag.If he seems unqualified to understand these numbers than post them here.Get all  of those numbers plus refrigerant ID and we can figure it out.Also indoor temp rise would not hurt either,HVAC,cefervc,1,t5_2s8ms

10316,0,t1_cefkkim,Unless you are sticking your head out the window and looking down you wouldnt see the  PVC pipe coming out of the wall.  Its small and doesnt protrude very far at all.  There is no way to vent gases out to your condenser.  Im not saying that it would be incorrect to do so.  Im saying that its not possible.  If this guy came in and gave you a smaller unit and changed where the vent goes its because he gave you a high efficiency system.  Theyre smaller because they dont waste as much gas and they vent out the wall because the fact that they arent blowing  of your heat out the flue means they can push the exhaust gas through a small pvc pipe.,HVAC,cefly6p,3,t5_2s8ms
47135,0,t3_1un67l,Welcome to the club fellow midwesterner! In my case I know its because the house is real old and the insulation is terrible. I have an ice cold draft coming in from the under the switch plate next to the front door.The boiler will run until its internal temperature reaches a set point mine seems to kick off around F and then turn off until it cools below a threshold. Its the radiators job to disperse that heat into the house and return cool water to the boiler for reheating. If your issue is like mine the radiators arent dumping the heat fast enough into the rooms to match the heat being removed from the house by the cold wind and drafty windows. Both the feed and return pipes to the boiler and the radiators themselves are plenty hot but Im just not getting enough heat transfer to the rooms.Having also just bought my house this year April! Im curious to hear what the experts have to suggest. The heating systems are typically not sized for temperatures this cold so we may just have to deal with it my house is hanging at F right now. At the very least I know you need to keep your radiators free of dust which acts as an insulating blanket. I looked up the manual for my boiler and it looks like there is a lengthy startup and shutdown procedure that is supposed to be performed every year. My house was a foreclosure so I doubt the previous owners did it and I didnt think to do anything about it in the fall since it seemed to work just fine.,HVAC,cejsp07,0,t5_2s8ms

Im a certified installer of many brands and about  of them require you to either agree to only sell their brand or go to a sales class. Other brands do require training but I dont know the requirements that those brands have. So being certified will either mean that they had a few days training a day long sales class or just an agreement to sell their equipment. No way to know which it is. As far as Ruud vs Rheem the Rheem is a quieter brand. Most of the additional cost is either better powder coating rust protection better sound dampening and warranty.

With both of these running and with up to  guys in the garage the units barely make a dent in the Texas heat.OK that wont work then. But if you need  tons of mini splits with or without multiple heads I dont see the cost coming down much below the . Even that would probably be a lowend brand.

I do know that they run super high head pressures especially if they face the sun during the hot part of the day and while the condenser fan is coming up to speed the head pressures can reach nearly psi. Good units for cooler climates but horrible for gulf coast climates. Not much you can do other than have them upgrade to the newer a units which are awesome. I would seriously recommend they replace those with newer units. Liebert makes fanfuckingtastic  ton wall mount units but they are  phase while those Bards are likely single phase.

2127300,0,t3_2jbo0d,This spreadsheet is really useful for these things With your energy prices and assuming a heat pump HSPF of  and gas AFUE of  the operating cost is really really close. Heat pump is  and gas is . these are cost per million BTU just compare them to each other. The furnace will have a small additional cost for running the furnace fan and it will lose more energy to air leakage driven by the uneven pressurization of the house. And if you have ducts in the attic then youll lose a significant amount of efficiency there too. So the gas furnace route has more potential pitfalls that can waste more energy that arent accounted for in the ideal calculations in that spreadsheet while the mini splits are more plugnplay and dont have as many opportunities for sabotaging their efficiency. In short the mini split may be a little cheaper to run but not dramatically so. It also provides cooling which is of some benefit in the PNW. There will be more roomtoroom temperature differences if youre just using a ductless wall head on each floor especially when you keep doors closed. If you end up still using the wall heaters to compensate for uneven heating then youll quickly lose any running cost benefit that the mini splits have. Wall insulation will help here... but really wall insulation will help either way and is a good idea.Duct installation cost Im guessing is pretty variable.

Before you commit to a new boiler check that your baseboards are not clogged with minerals or rotted through in places. You can pressurize the baseboards with  psi air and check that the pressure does not fall for a day or two. You could flush the baseboards to see that they flow freely and cleanly.Baseboards lose some of their ability to supply heat as they age. The fins get coated with grime which can be cleaned if you are willing to put in the time and the fins actually lose some thermal contact with the copper tubing after many cycles.You can put up M shrink plastic interior storm windows to reduceeliminate draft from the windows. Available at any hardware store.You gotta get new windows doors and insulation. I removed all my sheathing and built out the walls to accept  inches of insulation.

While others say that if you get zapped all day then your RH is too low.As far as the walls attracting water comment. Putting a humidifier by a wall is just like taking a spray bottle and spraying a fine mist in to the air beside a wall. Some of the air will mix with the air thus humidifying as intended while other water will get on the wall. Long term exposure to that can cause mold and premature rotting.Go take a spray bottle hold it a foot from the wall and mist towards the wall. You will see exactly what Im talking about. The wall might not be dripping wet but it will be wet to the touch and that is something you do not want.If you put the humidifier in the middle of the room this definitely will not be an issue.

3262708,0,t1_coteknn,Im a little late here but I like an apprentice who asks questions and I didnt want you to go away with such an incomplete answer.A VAV is a lot more than that a simple manual inline damper controls air flow to a zone.It would be more accurate to say that a VAV intelligently and actively controls air flow to a zone based on feedback from sensors and a control system.Youll know one when you see one in the field. Theyre installed inline in ductwork and will have an insulated plenum and a electric or pneumatic actuated damper valve on one end cw control wires.They are of course all networked in order to try and keep the system balanced by checking variables temp pressures etc. and making automatic adjustments on the fly.Theyre only used in larger projects commercial or towers etc. but these smart vents in OPs link are an attempt to bring that technology to the residential field.Now I see mostly negative comments about them here the top comment being a sarcastic Oh God but I think that if these things are actually smart and can be tied into a modern residential NEST thermostat system they could be very useful.One of the biggest troubleshooting problems with residential systems are usually questions of air balance and zone control. People are always futzing with dampers in order to heat up cold rooms or cut off heat to rooms they never use ... and then wondering why their unit is laboring and their heating bills have gone up.Having controllable dampers would compliment the new wave of programmable thermostats and HVACs and is really the next logical step in the effort to bring residential systems into the modern age.They would let homeowners have zone control help systems be more efficient and probably pay for themselves especially if they become more common and the price comes down ... cause these ones seem pretty friggin expensive.,HVAC,cp06w8q,1,t5_2s8ms

It is so important to build a foundation of concepts so that you can be a more effective at trouble shooting issues in the field. I feel it is more important to know why there was a failure rather than how it failed. Circuits motors the refrigeration cycle and basic heat transfer are things that you may not necessarily pick up by experience alone. Especially if you eventually want to be more than a technician. for example if you wish to move on to specify equipment you must know how to properly and thoroughly calculate the building load and spec the proper equipment for the application.

There is also different installation factors to consider depending on how your house was put together and how the previous mechanical contractor installed the system.  You also need to factor in local city and state codes.  The only way to know if you got a quality bid is to compare with other local contractors if you feel the price is not correct.

Answering a question about a c wire is a little different than them modifying anything to do with the combustion part of the furnace or screwing with the gas or power lines. No one would get mad if an HVAC guy said hey you really shouldnt mess with that its really dangerous and could risk health or property if you get it wrong give a tech a call if it was truly dangerous. Thanks for reminding me that all us tech people do are screw with cat  none of us work with any sort of mission critical software or hardware. Wait dont we write the software and build the boards that control the furnaces? Maybe we should get hazard pay after all there is a level of danger when dealing with electricity high pressure gas and explosive fuels. You dont want your code jockey running low of caffeine and programming that logic for the cwire to detonate your furnace! I also never deal with cat or cat cable I wouldnt want to risk getting a jolt of  volts  sAgain every trade or profession has people asking DIY questions that people in said trades get sick of answering for the same reasons. Its a bit pretentious to say that no one should DIY when it comes to HVAC because there are experienced people that spent time and money to learn that trade.  By that logic no one should do any work outside of there area of expertise ever.  If you want to prevent your blood pressure going up from reading a dumb question then dont open it.  Its really easy to avoid or bury those questions on reddit and theres no reason to get your knickers all twisted up and act all selfrighteous.

Where are you what temperature is it when the hvac is running all the time when do you see the  dollar electric bills etc.Keep this in mind if your AC runs  hours a day it is removing k btu heathr forgoing any latent vs sensible conversions etc  hours a day from your house.  If you have a larger unit like a  or  ton unit it will be able to pull k or k btu per hour per from your house. What is being missed is that the KWh used will be EXACTLY the same comparing BTU to BTU.  So if it costs  dollars to keep your house cool now it will cost  dollars to keep it cool with a system later if it is the same efficiency and the system is working properly.  Given that it will take the same or realistically MORE energy because it would be able to cool morefaster.BTW the tripping the breaker thing... uh your AC is broken.  It needs fixing thats probably whats costing you  dollars not anything else. Depending on where you live and your insulation and other details  ton could be perfectly fine for your house.

8560890,0,t3_4wzugc,Heat pumps in VA require a backup of some sort.  Depending on where in VA you are it may or may not make sense.  If you currently have a gas furnace and are considering replacing your setup due to age or whatever a dual fuel setup works very well.  I had one at my old house with a two stage high efficiency heat pump outside.  It was very quiet kept the house nice and toasty and when the weather dipped down below  degrees what they call lockout temperature it switched from the heat pump creating heat to the  gas furnace on the inside.If you dont have gas already the standard is to use an electric coil on the inside.  So when you hit lockout the heat pump outside turns off and you start using an electric coil to heat the air in your air handler.  It is no where near as cost effective as gas but if you dont already have gas it is vastly cheaper to install...In either case the colder it is the less it makes sense to use a heat pump.  They save a lot of money when it is between  degrees outside assuming you wont want much heat above .  In that range they coast by and are able to pull huge amounts of heat from the air and put it inside.  When it gets below  a heat pumps efficiency drops precipitously and gas becomes more cost effective especially if you can get a  unit. One other reason to get a heat pump is humidity.  If you have an  furnace they cause a draft by their basic operation and will help pull humid air out of the house in the winter.  Unless you have a well sealed house you might not want this.  Heat pumps force no exchange of air and can help with keeping the humidity in your house.  Though sealing up the cracks does vastly more than the heat pump ever will.,HVAC,d6bosgu,1,t5_2s8ms

The increase in surface area relative to airflow decreases or completely eliminates the bypass factor resulting in greater heat transfer thereby raising the apparatus dew point and increasing the sensible heat ratio.Lastly the increased sensible heat ratio necessarily reduces equipment runtime because after all we are operating to maintain SENSIBLE temperature.

They draft the combustion gases upwards.  If youve got an atmospheric gas water heater super standard water heater youll notice that it has a little hood on top of the water heater where its open on every side.  This is to keep the pilot from getting blown out.  But the natural draft of that type of flue system causes the flue gases to go up and out.But its still not a bad idea to patch that hole in your chimney and its easy if a little messy to do.  And Ill also say that its never a bad idea to get a CO alarm because while this issue shouldnt be a worry its a smart safety device to have because our equipment can fail majorly sometimes.PS The standard check for a good draft from a chimney is to hold your bic lighter right next to the draft hood.  Youll see the flame get sucked into the draft hood.  Were not supposed to smoke in customers houses but the smoke being sucked into the chimney is a similarly good clue.

11501411,0,t3_6454bs,Reversing valve could be bad and TXV would cause other issues. Have you changed your stat recently? If not depending on your stat you can change a setting which will determine when your reversing valve is energized. Bit of a long shot but perhaps the stat restored to factory defaults possibly after battery dying. When you turn your stat to ac does it heat your house as normal?,HVAC,dfzonzr,1,t5_2s8ms

11526385,0,t3_64j7pf,Ill start to get the thread going.VAV BoxesThe maintenance folks around here love dual duct systems because if theres an issue with the VAV box its easy to diagnose and quick to fix  its either the actuator or the controller. They prefer not to have hot water reheat coils on VAV boxes but we still use them when we can because it allows for significantly more efficient control.Energy RecoverySeemingly every owner will spring for an enthalpy wheel but then not give Maintenance the money to fix them if the belt breaks or if the surface needs to be recoated. So instead of having a super efficient wheel thats not going to work for long theyd rather have a fixed plate heat exchanger.,HVAC,dg2in2z,3,t5_2s8ms
