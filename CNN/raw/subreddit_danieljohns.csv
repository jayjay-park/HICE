4771496,0,t3_3f1owz,After reading what I wrote I didnt really answer you specific question about the album as much I just speeled about my man crush. ANYWAY I have a really hard time with this question.Its hard for me to see through my unabashed love for Daniels music. Ive been a fan since  was influenced by Silverchair in my own music and even now scour the internet on a daily basis looking for the next little tidbit of what hes up to. This sort of obession oh god can I please not call it that? really fogs up my perception of his latest music. But Ill try.First of all the album is wierd. And I dont mean the music as much as I mean the order of the tracks and shifts in style throughout. The package as a whole. It strikes me more as a compliation of past and current works than an actual album. This bothers me a bit because I am normally  a full album guy. I put on a record and listen to it front to back most times. I cant do this with Talk. It is most definitely a pop record but not intentionally so. Listening and reading interviews reveals that D.J. is still as much of a creative force as he ever was. But stepping back from the instruments and bringing in collaborators really gave the record a nupop kind of feel. Luckily Ive been into a lot of electronic stuff in the years between Young Modern and now so I dont really mind until about halfway through when the RampB thing starts to get a little repetitive. Another thing that bothers me is that the album is quite static with very little dynamic change going on.The vocals though! Absolutely love them. I really wasnt sure wherw Daniel was going with his falsetto style for a while there but he really seems to have found a balance between that sweet sweet nectar and the sort of whine we get during the chorus of Preach. Im still holding out hope that hell go back to taking full advantage of his diaphragm sometime soon.The most important realization for me though was that the man has still got some serious music to make. Im hoping to a true solo album next. I dont need big guitars but something written soley or mostly by Daniel. I know hes still got it in him but sometimes I fear hes a little too cozy in the postrock star life to commit to such an involved project. We shall see. For now Ill just keep grooving around my living room to Talk,danieljohns,ctvzn7r,3,t5_3686k
