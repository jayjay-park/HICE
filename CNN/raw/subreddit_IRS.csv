3158972,0,t3_2wc2ev,So this is what it all distills down to.  I hope the IRS employees are offered protection.  There is NOT ENOUGH  on the planet to get me to do this under ANY circumstances if I worked for the IRS.  On the bright side at least theyre trying different ideas.  The goal should be to avoid rioting.,IRS,copfbn8,1,t5_2shs6
3259690,0,t3_2xew8z,IRS employee hereYou should attach Forms F and D to your return or respond with these forms when you receive your first notice.File the  timely and make the largest payment you can afford and still make your monthly IA payment when you file. Expect to increase your IA payment and commit to a Direct Debit Installment Agreement in order to avoid a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. At minimum there will be a onetime  fee to add the new liability to the existing IA.Thank you for reading.,IRS,cozvmf4,1,t5_2shs6

8135223,0,t3_4qn134,The CP is not a bill which means you dont owe a balance due today and you have the opportunity to respond and possibly reduce or eliminate the potential tax increase.Your reply to the CP falls into one of three categoriesAgreed  The IRS Very Old Computer VOC is  correct and you agree with all of the proposed changes. If this is the case respond to the notice and pay the amount due or pay the largest amount you can afford by the notice due date. You can generally request a payment plan for any part of the balance due you cant pay in full. If you take no actions this will be the default determination. You will receive a Statutory Notice of Deficiency in about  days then the actual notice and demand for payment about  days after that.Disagreed The Service is  wrong you owe no additional tax and you can prove why by responding with written substantiation the issue involves ID Theft or the income was reported correctly in another place on the return on or before the time frame on the notice. Partially Agreed Part of the proposed assessment is correct but its less than what IRS states. You can prove why by responding with written substantiation and you pay the correct tax amount with your response. If the Service agrees with your response you will receive a bill for the revised interest due. If you have any questions about the CP  or what to submit in response call the tollfree number on the notice. An amended return on Form X is generally not required.If you understand the notice you determine the notice is  correct or you cant pay the Agreed or Partially Agreed amount in full but you need a payment arrangement call  M  F am  pm and speak with a representative. They will verify your identity and research your account. You should still submit the appropriate written response to the notice.,IRS,d4uh19g,2,t5_2shs6

11726106,0,t1_dgoxlg0,They have been plain disrespectful. I left it at the border of my sanity after they told me they ran the process again and it should work this time. I will call next week to keep trying to confirm but they told me I have to wait  more weeks now. Its like they have reverse accountability. They screw up then dont own up to it and place the blameresponsibility on the taxpayer.
