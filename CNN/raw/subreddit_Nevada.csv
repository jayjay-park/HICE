7361689,0,t3_4g5fpe,When in Ely La Fiesta the mexican restaurant is a must visit. They are well known for their cabbage salsa  trust me its amazing. Ely is a cool little town. It very much feels like it got frozen in time in the s. The Hotel Nevada is worth a stay but be warned the walls are paper thin. The Jailhouse casino is cool because theres a steakhouse with tables in jail cells but the whole place smells like  years of cigarette smoke. Ely is good access for trails and what not. Very pretty area. Baker is waaaay smaller than Ely but a cool little artsy town. Nice people. Good access to Great Basin Ntl Park and some hot springs. You can totally do both in one trip.,Nevada,d2ez29c,4,t5_2rqwi

8811380,0,t1_d7691c2,Basically the way we vote sucks.  If two people run its fine.  If I vote for one you can vote for the other.  Our votes are balanced.  We are equal.If three or more people run then there is a problem.  I vote for one you can only vote for one of the others.  There is no way for you to balance against my vote.  We arent equal.  We want our votes to count so we end up voting only for the parties even if we dont really want to.  Thats how we get a two party system.So what this reform does is it makes it so that you can say your opinion about all the candidates.  In that way if you wanted to you could balance against my vote and we would be equal.  For example say there are three candidates A B and C.  Say I put AgtBgtC.  You could put CgtBgtA to balance against my vote.The way to tally up all the votes is a little more complicated but the basic reason is we want to say our opinion about everyone.Another way to make a more equal voting system is to just say yesno to each candidate.  Then you can balance my yes with a no or vice versa.  I think this is easier to understand.,Nevada,d770b04,2,t5_2rqwi
