71783,0,t3_1uxe0j,Copy and paste of my replyThe view that a large increase government expenditure caused the great depression flies in the face of almost everything we have learned in Macro since the Great Depression. The short of it is that the mismanagement of the gold standard by the worlds central banks lead to a sharp decrease in money supply which led to a large and unexpected decrease in the price level.  This in Irving Fisher debtdeflation fashion increased the real level of debt burden and lead to increased bank failures and panics.  This process was repeated with varying degrees of incompetence until the FDR took office in .  Bernanke can take it from heregtA striking example from U.S. history is Franklin Roosevelts  percent devaluation of the dollar against gold in  enforced by a program of gold purchases and domestic money creation. The devaluation and the rapid increase in money supply it permitted ended the U.S. deflation remarkably quickly. Indeed consumer price inflation in the United States year on year went from . percent in  to . percent in  to . percent in . The economy grew strongly and by the way  was one of the best years of the century for the stock market. If nothing else the episode illustrates that monetary actions can have powerful effects on the economy even when the nominal interest rate is at or near zero as was the case at the time of Roosevelts devaluation.,badeconomics,cemlntm,3,t5_2wbw4

There are only  and none of them suggest this at all. The main argument was as followsgti highly respect Kahneman and agree with his assessment but he doesnt understand the entire picture. great traders who consistently perform better than the market actually lose on the majority of their trades. so he is right to claim traders dont have a special reading ability of the markets since the majority of their trades result in losses. but by managing position sizes and risk successful traders will cut the frequent losses quickly and let their winning trades run. enough profit will be made on the winning trades to pay for the many small losses. so even though they suck at predicting markets great traders are great at managing risk and thats why they perform wellI think thats very different to what you were saying.. and im not sure it quite classifies as rfinance being mad at Daniel Kahneman.

2274209,0,t1_clsr6hx,gtJapan Grows  Expansionary fiscal policy works has some datadiscussion perhaps relevant to the discussion.Look at the same graphs during the s in Japan and you will see that fiscal stimulus changed nothing. Japan did experience two severe GDP shocks financial crisis earthquake during the last  years that certainly play a role here. Also the graph is misleading. Japan did not stop having huge budget deficits during   quite the contrary. In fact government expenditure has increased enormously since  and stayed high with record budgets look up the  budget. They just shifted towards public consumption instead of investing which the graph conveniently hides. So if one were to guess a causation here which is ridiculous given just a graph and  variables it would be Government investment but not government consumption pushes growth which is also the consensus of most empirical papers.As you mentioned IMF policyHere is the reason why they act like they act. If they found fiscal multipliers to be low or even negative there is no reason why Japan should make budget deficits.Ill add a disclaimer here The topic of fiscal multipliers is one big controversial issue. I personally do not take a side in this debate because there is no clear answer to this. There are many studies that show fiscal multipliers well above . especially during recessions and thus advocate for fiscal stimuli. There are also a lot studies that dont find any effect or even negative effects. From what I gathered most studies do indeed find positive effects of fiscal stimuli in the short term but are uncertain of the consequences in the long run. The effect of multipliers also seems to be decreasing across the globe probably because of less restrictions to capital transfer and currency exchange. My personal conclusion is therefore No empirically we do not know anything.Also I actually dodid not want to discuss economic issues on reddit as I find it a bad platform for serious discussions. My original point is not to refute your arguments which I cannot as I mentioned above those are valid arguments depending on which studies you cite but to  point out the ignorance and political agenda of OP which I think should not belong in reconomics.,badeconomics,clst7px,2,t5_2wbw4

2482802,0,t1_cmimjcy,gtBasically the empirical results obtained from research and controlled experimentation are based on human universals such as degrees celcius seconds Cesium clock joules one ounce of water one degree as standards. When we have these standards we can tell if the empirical results are valid.Empirical results in economics are also based on observables actions taken real GDP real income savings etc.  For example data used to test models in family economics might include fertility decisions marriage rates real income education attainment and household savings decisions.  Some of these are constructed such as the CPI basket used to calculate real income.  But that only serves to introduce measurement error which isnt too hard to deal with it biases any correlations downward so a significant result with measurement error is significant.No one estimatescalibrates models by measuring values.  Utility is used to figure out what decisions people make in the model decisions are observable in the data and for welfare analysis at the end.  Only the ordering of utility matters.  It doesnt matter if we multiply all utility levels by  the end decisions made will be the same.gtI think what youd have to do is not only have Poppers theories be falsifiable but also the variables which are to be used independent and dependent.Kuhns central point is that science does not work and cannot work through simple falsifiability.  In order to even make sense of data you must have theory.  Suppose we think pressure goes up with altitude.  We take a barometer up a mountain and find the measured pressure goes down.  Does pressure go down with altitude or do barometers work differently than we thought?  In order to falsify the hypothesis that pressure goes up with altitude we must accept the prevailing theory of how barometers work. No science can escape this and making variables falsifiable does nothing.Same goes for economics.  Until a better research paradigm or framework comes along the only game in town is mainstream economics with rational expectations and all that jazz it actually works better than you give it credit for.  Behavioral economics does not yet have a coherent framework which can replace the mainstream economic framework yet just ask ubesttrousers.I have no idea what you mean by resource.gtBut I wouldnt say the same about game theory being as how its based on artificial rational agents which are roughly theoretical biology withstanding impossible to control upon in the natural world.Game theory is not the part of economics you want to pick a fight with p.

Thats not science.  Real science is looking at empirical papers they reference leftleaning people getting elasticities that support interventionist policies or multipliers as well and verifying those results over and over.  Political bias should be filtered out after repeating empirical testing because if political bias gets you an abnormally highlow elasticitymultiplier then youll be an outlier.Anyway I think classifying people as rightleft on a sliding scale is flawed and ultimately policy prescriptions come down to normative beliefs.  For instance if that one paper on the optimal tax rate on  income was  was completely correct I still would oppose that tax rate on justice grounds.Idk I think its just a bunch of bunk and they hid their bunk in their assumptions.Either way HaJoon Chang was right.EDIT Even if Piketty is right I probably would oppose something that would fix whatever Piketty was talking about.,badeconomics,cmp5k1v,3,t5_2wbw4

Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Mises Academy and Ive been involved in numerous Cato Journal symposiums on why central banking sucks and I have over  confirmed posts to rAnarchoCapitalism. I am trained in praxeology and Im the top praxxer in my entire Austrian economic reading group. You are nothing to me but just another Keynesian. I will defeat you in an internet debate with logic the likes of which has never been seen before on this forum mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that externalities exist to me over the Internet? Think again fiat fundie. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of libertyminded academics across the USA and your citation record is being traced right now so you better prepare for the audit math monkey. The audit that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your central banking system. Youre fucking dead Krugmanite. I can be anywhere anytime and I can call out your logical fallacies in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my action axiom. Not only am I extensively trained in snarky comebacks but I have access to the entire personal collections of Murray Rothbard at the Mises Institute and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of academia you little shill. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

3068842,0,t1_cog02rv,I think fundamentally at the heart of it its the counterintuitive nature of statisticsprobabilityvarious mathematics.Like have you ever met someone who doesnt really get probability? You know where they say that everything is  chance cus either it happens or it doesnt?Then you might go a step further with people that cant wrap their head around the Monty hall problem. How can the probability change by someone just opening a door?Everyone has their intuitive breaking point. I just read about the hydra game It seems completely counter intuitive to me that no matter what you do cutting off heads randomly will eventually kill the hydra when it seems like you have twice as many or even n times as many heads after you do that.And economics is orders of magnitude more complicated than any of these things. The interactions between millions of people with hugely complex rules as to how everything plays out.Its not a field that can be easily intuited. And sometimes I think a persons ideology or ethics are simply intuitive shortcuts for understanding a complex system. An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind is a statement about ethics and is also an economic theorem about the total quantity of eyes when you think about it.I think this is where things like If you automate jobs eventually well run out of jobs or If you lower the minimum wage everyone will have less money come from. They are highly intuitive statements. To me as a laymen a big part of Economics seems to be all about challenging our intuitions with experimental data. I think people generally dont like this because it makes understanding economics naturally effortful and exclusive. It means that unless theyve spent a lot of time reading and probably doing a fair deal of math something that seems obvious is in fact not obvious at all.And the fact that ethical concerns are deeply tied into economic problems i.e. some people seem to benefit more some people seem like theyre unfairly impoverished etc. make it easier to explain away someone giving a hard to understand counter intuitive answer as a person promoting their own biased agenda.Imagine if you said told people that they should switch doors when playing the monty hall game but they thought youd earn more money if they picked the goat. Its already hard enough to convince people of the math  if they thought you had an agenda they would never believe you.,badeconomics,cog2yks,28,t5_2wbw4

3132342,0,t1_commqcm,Why would we no longer use money? I think youre begging the question here. Money wouldnt be necessary if we were postscarcity but if were not necessarily postscarcity you cant assume theres no money.Even if you have machines designing machines ad infinitum this is still a limited process. It would no longer be limited by the amount of labour available but it would still be limited by the amount of energy land buildings machinery et cetera available. There would still be a finite amount of these other resources and you still need a market to allocate these resources. Machines would be building in each other in a finite amount of time while using a finite amount of energy and space.If certain finite resources are occupied producing goods for one person they cant simultaneously produce goods for someone else. So we would still need markets to decide who gets access to what capital.,badeconomics,comnykk,2,t5_2wbw4

3290874,0,t1_cp2yjfs,I still dont understand the relevance of the LTV if it is not a theory of price determination.Unless were talking about value differently than Marx and hence talking past one another I dont see why Marx is somehow still right that value is determined by the average time it takes to create a good.If were talking about valuation lets talk about preference relations.  If I prefer X to Y I value X higher than Y.  Marx is then arguing that X is more valuable to Y because theres a higher average labor that goes into it?Doesnt make sense.  We move preference relations into utility functions to talk about utility maximization so I think its defensible to talk about value as congruent to preference relations.Anyway while uTheOldGentleman says that Marx doesnt reject that value is subjective many Marxists do.  Furthermore the LTV is related to capitalists appropriating surplus labor.  So I think that theres till a relationship between the LTV and prices despite what Marxists say.Maybe no one knows what Marx means if Marxists cant even agree.Marx shouldve written down a model.,badeconomics,cp3dwv9,6,t5_2wbw4

3512736,0,t1_cpsnbw3,gtGoogle has openly admitted that it mines everything it gives away for free for the users characteristics. Thats such a broad and farreaching claim that I think you should try to find a citation for it. My guess is the best that could be found is some redditor or blogger stating as fact without backup. Also they didnt openly admit. They didnt get caught doing something secretly. They clearly state and disclose what theyre going to do and they also give clear ways to view the data theyre using opt out of targeted advertising and even take any data you have with them and export it.Google tailors the ads based on what youre searching for and they try to guess about your demographics too. Theyre very clear about the ways they use data thats uploaded and they dont scan Google docs for commercial uses they obviously provide search and things like that in Drive.If were just going to assume despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that every company online is doing the scummiest possible things with our data how is that helpful?

The real exchange rate is how many American baskets of goods it takes to buy the same basket of goods in Britain. What matters for trade is the real exchange rate. If the USD depreciates but the price level increases by the same amount then the real exchange rate hasnt changed. This would not make US exports cheaper in real terms. If the USD depreciates in real terms then this would make US exports cheaper since someone in Britain would have to give up fewer baskets of British goods to get a basket of American goods. ,badeconomics,crpg284,4,t5_2wbw4

You can get used old textbooks for real cheap.Paul Krugmans Pop Internationalism is probably the best way to learn economics if you dont want to commit to a boring ol textbook. Alternatively you can google for Krugmans old Slate articles and youll get half of the book for free online.

4229933,0,t1_crwlf4j,Hey I dont mean to jump in on a thread but I just wanted to clear a few things up regarding your interpretation of social contract theory Also sorry if it is long winded.gtSocial contract theory is about individuals getting together and legitimizing a state of some sort via a contract between everyone.gtHowever if it is literally an agreement between the State does this State have agency? is it nonhuman? and the citizen well Ive never signed such an agreement.gtFirst usually no social contact theorist believes that we literally sign an agreement it is usually cast in terms of what a group of ideally rational agents would agree to be the best rules to organizing society. The granddaddy of this entire way of thinking about political philosophy and the basic structure of organizing society is John Rawls social contract view as described in A Theory of Justice. As a side note many philosophers do disagree that we can identify goodness with rationality but that is a metaethical argument for another day.Second and this is something else that may be of interest to this of a libertarian bent Rawls contractarian view is supposed to show that we need a robust system of distributive justice including welfare and taxation on pain of being nonrational utility maximizing agents. The gist of this picture sorry if you already know some of this from reading up on contract theory is that imagine we have knowledge of the distribution of wealth and poverty talents and abilities socioeconomic standings et cetera of members in a society plus knowledge of the laws of the social sciences sociology psychology economics et cetera. However we dont know where were going to land i.e. we dont know where in society we will be as an individual when we are born. If we are to be rational selfinterested agents we would want a society that is as fair as possible. No one wants to be born into family that scrapes by working in a Dickensian workhouse. Hence the basic conclusion is that on pain of irrationality we would agree to some form of distributive justice and thus taxation. Rawls basically tries to find a way to harmonize the intuition that society should be a fair one with a society that allows responsibility and the ability to shape our own lives without much interference from the state or other people. Also your worry about human rights being nonsocial constructs or natural rights that sort of view has a lot of metaphysical baggage to it. Namely you need to give a theory how people bear these nonnaturalistic properties it can be done but it requires a lot of metaethical legwork. Rawls theory as well as other contractarians look up T. M. Scanlon and C. Korsgaards metaethical work has the benefit of avoiding this porblem since rights are just what rational individuals would agree to.Sorry if this is super abbreviated but here are some good resources on the matterRawls in general.and regarding the thoughtexperiment I just mentioned its called the Original Position Also if you want more resources pm me. Social contract theory is a lot more nuanced since Rousseau. ,badeconomics,cs2e7we,1,t5_2wbw4

4277217,0,t1_cs7qciw,gt I dont mean to do that. That being said I do not think it is right to take money from the rich who earned it via voluntary exchanges simply because you dislike the distribution created by individual activities.And thats the difference between Nozick and Rawls right there.  Rawls accounts for the diminishing marginal utility of money and allows for some level of income redistribution in a capitalist system to bring the level of the poorest up even if theres some deadweight loss compared with a nonredistributionist system.  Nozick does not.The classic mental experiment goes like this Imagine youre going to get dropped into one of three islands.  You can choose which island you get into but not which position you have on any given island.  Island A maximizes aggregate income minimizes taxation shuns redistribution.    Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Total aggregate annual income  M.  Island B seeks to maximize the minimum position but allows inequality otherwise.  Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Total aggregate annual income  .  Island C seeks total equality at any cost.  Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Position  earns  per year.  Total aggregate annual income  .  So which island do you choose?  A B or C?  Rawlsians say its supposed to be the rational choice to pick Island B in this scenario.  Granted this is oversimplified but it gets at the crux of the intiution for modern liberal welfarestate capitalism.The important thing to understand is that Rawlsians are not doing this because they hate the rich.  Thats not the idea behind the political philosophy.  The idea is that money has a higher marginal utility for lower earners.  They are not arguing for perfect equality.  And I bring up Rawls not to arbitrarily appeal to authority but to add a little background to your taking issue with Krugman specifically because Krugman calls himself a Rawlsian.gt I do not think it is right to take money from the rich who earned it via voluntary exchanges simply because you dislike the distribution created by individual activities.There is a lot more political theory packed into this statement.  But it all rests upon the legitimacy of property rightsrules.Suffice it to say that in a republic we can make the laws that dictate how land is usedtaxed allodial title free and clear fee simple title attached to a monarch fee simple title attached to a municipal incorporation within a state etc. which kinds of inheritance are allowed or defaulted to you dont see primogeniture or entails much since the th century for instance which kinds of intellectual property are allowed copyright trademark patent all three for how long?  etc and yes even which kinds of provisions are made for the poor Elizabethan Poor Laws of  or the Social Security Act.These things are infinitely contestable.  But no matter how many voluntary exchanges you have they cant tell you whether you should have a fee simple or an allodial land title.  They cant tell you whether property belonging to the deceaseds estates should default to a split between children the eldest male or the community.  They cant tell you how long IP should last for or what kinds of IP if any should be allowed.  And they cant tell you what tax rates should be or what kinds of provisions should be made for the poor.And yet each one of these rules absolutely affects the distribution created by individual activities.  And none of these rules necessarily has anything to do with voluntary exchanges.  All of that stuff has to be done through political theory.  Its all an intricate dance of power legitimacy social norms negotiations law politics and philosophy.  Even if exchanges that lead to increased wealth and income concentrations produce no other externalities they mess with the dance.  Which is all not to say that youre invalid for believing other political philosophies.  But it is to say that if you believe that alternate political philosophies are built upon a foundation of disliking making money and wealth creation  and they are not based on any such foundation  its not quite an accurate claim.,badeconomics,cs7req4,2,t5_2wbw4

4511835,0,t1_cszcr4x,I can try!The Federal Reserve has a mandate to keep inflation low over the medium term interpreted as a  target for expected core consumer price inflation over the next two years and is tasked with keeping employment high interpreted as keeping the unemployment rate at a low healthy rate. So the Fed takes action to achieve those goals action which works its way through inflation and employment over the next  months. Thats why the Fed articulates its goals in terms of keeping mediumterm inflation and employment stable  it cant affect those variables instantly.So the Fed needs to form expectations of how inflation will evolve over the next one to two years. Then they will increase interest rates if inflation is expected to be too high and reduce interest rates when inflation is expected to be too low. Ditto for unemployment. Similarly its very useful if the Fed has some idea of the private sectors expectations as well.That all brings us to futures markets.An inflation futures market is the financial markets expectation of inflation over some horizon. Currently the US has inflation futures markets out  months  year  years  years and  years.   The Fed can use this information to set its own policy if the market thinks the economy is likely to dip into recession in the next  years then inflation futures would fall and the Fed would see that and the Fed could loosen policy today. Preemptive recessionbusting!There is no comparable forecast for unemployment.That brings us to NGDP futures markets. Nominal GDP  the market value of all goods and services produced in the economy  is a good proxy for both inflation and employment. That is when NGDP is rising faster than normal the Fed often will wish to increase interest rates to cool off NGDP growth and viceversa if NGDP is rising more slowly than normal.  Nicely NGDP rolls the dual mandate inflation and employment  into a single mandate NGDP which has its own side benefits that I wont go into here.An NGDP futures market would provide the Federal Reserve with valuable information about the private sectors expectations of how the economy is going to evolve and hence would provide a valuable input to policy discussions. Its well worth spending public funds to subsidize such a market.,badeconomics,cszd4kb,5,t5_2wbw4

I have one model in the back of my head a New Keynesian model with capital accumulation. It incorporates various consumption investment financial and labor market frictions as appropriate. In the background technical progress is modelled with a quality ladder though one could use expanding variety to do the same thing.That model does not have a short run or a long run it describes the evolution of the economy periodbyperiod. I use such euphemisms as short run and long run to describe how the model behaves over shorter periods say zero to two years or longer periods say two to five years after a shock. My model looks an awful lot like the Keynesian Cross or ISLM in the first few periods after a shock. As firms and consumers adjust to their environment the model looks more and more like Solow.Yes the model is internally consistent. Yes the model shows how ones Keynesian shortrun dynamics melt into Solow longrun dynamics. Technical note there are two basic mechanisms a sticky price mechanism and a capital accumulation mechanism. Sticky prices have a halflife of one year and the capital stock adjusts slowly. Thats why the Keynesian elements dominate early and the Solow elements dominate late. Keynesian elements are basically absent five years after a shock.In the real world there are a few other mechanisms going on. Inventory adjustment dominates in the ultra short run which I dont model at all. Output adjusts somewhat slower than inventories and prices somewhat slower than output. Labor input adjusts about as quickly as output. The capital stock adjusts slowest of all. Firm entry and exit occurs somewhere in the middle. ,badeconomics,ct3jvwc,4,t5_2wbw4

The problem is optics and politics that ruin it so I am less hesitant. Though I do think that the Libyan Bosnian and current ISIS interventions to be well intentioned and find. Though critics like to claim hind sight and knowledge of uncontrollable events as a claim against war in general.Iran YayISIS Motivated by a modern fundamentalist movement and arguable the most extreme version of it. So yes it is in the strictest sense motivated by Islam but Islam much like Christianity is difficult to pin down. The fundamentalist movement that started after the Saudi family took over Mecca and Medina is a reaction to secularization of arabs away from tribal life to urban life. You will be surprised that even the least hardcore of islamists those that espouse politicalsocial conservative islamic politics are more affected by identity than theology. Which isnt really surprising. There is a lot I could discuss about Wahhabism since before it there was no centralized fundamentalist movement. And in a religion without an explicit clergy a centralized fundamentalist movement seems to create new ones attached with more baggage as a result of a variety of variables I dont know all of. To simplify modern political islam one could separate the explicitly religiously focused rather than identity focused. That means regular socialconservativesecular and islamist. Within Islamists there are salafiwahabi and muslim brotherhood believing in explicit theocracy unlike social conservatives who talk about alcohol and dress codes as part of culture. They are vertically a like in beliefs but not in their goals salafis are sometimes hermits and apolitical. Then within salafiwahabi there are jihadist. Those who use force muslim brotherhood uses politics. The reason ISIS exists is because of the Saudi family that supports the Wahabi family that centralizes a fundamentalist ideology and makes theocracy explicit which leads to gross and historically unfounded religious acts. You add figures that are charismatic and folk heroes a narrative that muslims are being attacked by the west and that modern life is without meaning and you got yourself a movement that can take a westerner and make him fundamentalist. Personally to me all Islamists are the same because of the explicit theocracy its a slippery slope and its results are seen in ISIS. You can have US Senators who are guided by morality from the Bible or some arab leaders who are personally religious and see Islam as part of their culture. But seeking guiding in governance only from theology and then doing so under a wrongful interpretation that no one follows is wrong. Happened in Gulf states went to Hamas to Egypt to Libya and Syria and birthed ISIS. Not all jihadis are the same but no Islamist is excusable.Meta data To be honest the effectiveness of catching terrorism using any data is impractical. The probability of attack plus the variables that need to be monitored is too large. My intuition tells me that the chance of a foreign govt hacking the data or the US it self abusing the data is larger than the chance of a terror attack in general. I do think it may discourage planning but still the number is so minute. Now if there was going to be some sort of spying or data collecting for the explicit use against targets than there is a goal and plan but as a defensive tactic I think its useless more than I think it is morally wrong.

4770937,0,t1_ctvn2zs,gtIts a little easy and I feel bad picking on this muppet but this argument is essentially saying intellectual property isnt a real thing and that any unique good produced is automatically a monopoly. Which is terrible economics.There are merits to what they are saying. Have a read through thisgtPrivate property is an alternative to both collective and common property. In a private property system property rules are organized around the idea that various contested resources are assigned to the decisional authority of particular individuals or families or firms. The person to whom a given object is assigned e.g. the person who found it or made it has control over the object it is for her to decide what should be done with it. In exercising this authority she is not understood to be acting as an agent or official of the society. She may act on her own initiative without giving anyone else an explanation or she may enter into cooperative arrangements with others just as she likes. She may even transfer this right of decision to someone else in which case that person acquires the same rights she had. In general the right of a proprietor to decide as she pleases about the resource that she owns applies whether or not others are affected by her decision. If Jennifer owns a steel factory it is for her to decide in her own interest whether to close it or to keep the plant operating even though a decision to close may have the gravest impact on her employees and on the prosperity of the local community.Though private property is a system of individual decisionmaking it is still a system of social rules. The owner is not required to rely on her own strength to vindicate her right to make selfinterested decisions about the object assigned to her if Jennifers employees occupy the steel factory to keep it operating despite her wishes she can call the police and have them evicted she does not have to do this herself or even pay for it herself. So private property is continually in need of public justificationfirst because it empowers individuals to make decisions about the use of scarce resource in a way that is not necessarily sensitive to others needs or the public good and second because it does not merely permit that but deploys public force at public expense to uphold it.It may be thought that the justificatory issue is nowadays moot with the collapse of socialist systems in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and the triumph of market economies all over the world. It is tempting to conclude that since economic collectivism has been thoroughly discredited the problem of justifying private property has been solved by default there is simply no alternative. But the point of discussing the justification of an institution is not only to defend it against is competitors. Often we justify in order to understand and also to operate the institution intelligently. In thinking about property there are a number of issues that make little sense unless debated with an awareness of what the point of private property might be. Some of these issues are technical. Consider for example the rule against perpetuities the registration of land titles or the limits on testamentary freedom all these would be like an arcane and unintelligible code to be learned at best by rote unless we connect them with the point of throwing social authority behind individual control or behind the individual disposition of control over material resources. See Ackerman  p. .The same is true of some grander issues. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that private property not be taken for public use without compensation. Clearly this prohibits the simple seizure of someones land for use say as a firing range or an airport. But what if the state places a restriction on the use of a persons land telling the owner that she may not erect a modern skyscraper because it will compromise the historical aesthetics of the neighborhood? Does this amount to a taking? Certainly the owner has suffered a loss she may have bought the land with the intention of developing it. On the other hand we should not pretend that there is a taking whenever any restriction is imposed I may not drive my car at  m.p.h. but I am still the owner of the car. Such questions cannot be answered intelligently without revisiting the reasons if any that there are for giving private property this sort of constitutional protection. Is it protected because we distrust the states ability to make intelligent decisions about resource use? Or is it protected because we want to place limits on the burdens that any individual may be expected to bear for the sake of the public good? Our sense of the ultimate values that private ownership is supposed to serve may make a considerable difference to our interpretation of the takings clause and other doctrines.Plainly private property and collective control are not allornothing alternatives. In every modern society some resources are governed by common property rules e.g. streets and parks some are governed by collective property rules e.g. military bases and artillery pieces and some are governed by private property rules toothbrushes and bicycles. Also there are variations in the degree of freedom that a private owner has over the resources assigned to him. Obviously an owners freedom is limited by background rules of conduct I may not use my gun to kill another person. These are not strictly property rules. More to the point are things like zoning restrictions which amount in effect to the imposition of a collective decision about certain aspects of the use of a given resource. The owner of a building in an historic district may be told for example that she can use it as a shop a home or a hotel but she may not knock it down and replace it with a skyscraper. In this case we may still say that the historic building counts as private property but if too many other areas of decision about its use were also controlled by public agencies we would be more inclined to say that it was really subject to a collective property rule with the owner functioning as steward of societys decisions.It is probably a mistake therefore to insist on any definition of private property that implies a proprietor has absolute control over his resource. Some jurists have even argued that the terms property and ownership should be eliminated from the technical discourse of the law see Grey . They say that calling someone the owner of a resource conveys no exact information about her rights in relation to that resource a corporate owner is not the same as an individual owner the owner of intellectual property has a different array of rights than the owner of an automobile and even with regard to one and the same resource the rights and duties of a landlord who owes nothing on his property might be quite different from those of a mortgagor.The eliminative proposal makes sense to this extent the position of a private owner is best understood not as a single right to the exclusive use and control of the object in question but as a bundle of rights which may vary from case to case Honore . Even exclusive use is a complex idea. It implies first that the owner is at liberty to us the object as he pleases within a range of generally acceptable uses. Secondly it implies that others have an obligation to refrain from using the object without the owners permission. The point about permission implies in turn that the owner has the power to license others to use her property. She may lend her automobile rent her house or grant a right of way over her land. The effect of this may be to create other property interests in the object so that the various liberties rights and powers of ownership are divided among several individuals.,badeconomics,ctvx3zs,8,t5_2wbw4

5503100,0,t1_cwf2653,gt If I understand the argument right when at the ZLB raising interest rates will raise inflation. Not quite. None of it relies on the ZLB at all. Instead a high permanent nominal interest peg will raise inflation and a low permanent nominal interest peg e.g. a Fed that explicitly plans to stay at the ZLB forever will lower inflation. This is because everyone knows that the nominal interest rate will be stuck at its new value forever and knows that since monetary policy cant influence real variables like the real interest rate forever inflation will shift instead. Which is stupid. Monetary policy not being able to permanently affect real variables a conclusion and assuming it in your model is actually the literal definition of begging the question. And unlike many other results using some form of ratex this one is like a knifes edge and breaks down completely if you assume even the slightest departures from rationality or perfect information or for that matter permanence see Woodford . It makes sense as a sort of avant garde criticism of the New Keynesian paradigm and how easy it is to get lost in absurd conclusions as a result of blindly following rational expectations and through Woodford  we see that this has actually sparked a bit of behavioral theory in macro. But Cochrane and Williamson seem to actually believe this to be true. gt We could easily test this by simply raising rates  a lot. Experimental macro and all that.

5518766,0,t1_cwgsyo5,Reddit as a whole is hostile towards women. The overall demographics of Reddit skew heavily towards men but not as heavily as this survey and that is for a few reasons.Most who participate in Reddit do it without an account and without subscribing. In this set of people we have the most even distribution of genders because they are not as familiar with how sexist Reddit can be.After creating an account most still only participate in the largest of subreddits. This group starts to transition into unsubscribing from defaults and subscribing to smaller subreddits subs with only a couple  thousand subscribers. In this stage we will see a much larger drop off among women than men because they will start to see the dark under belly of Reddits sexism.This is what causes the entire skew of male dominated subreddits. Even subreddits that you would assume would skew female like rShitRedditSays skew male. Even porn subreddits that are meant to cater towards women like rladybonersgw highly NSFW porn end up being mostly gay and bisexual men.And of course this subreddit will undergo a further skew by already being a male dominated field so even fewer of the women who are left who could see rbadeconomics will subscribe.The way to fix this issue would be to advertise in non reddit avenues but that doesnt seem feasible.,badeconomics,cwh2mah,9,t5_2wbw4

But if you look at a whole labour market you also get the effect that people will move into this market from other markets if the wage rate in that particular market increases if waiters start getting higher pay increases than fastfood workers people will switch jobs or people who werent working may be tempted to start working if wages increase and the rewards for working are higher. This means that the labour supply curve for the whole market should generally be upwardsloping.,badeconomics,cwwhmqj,2,t5_2wbw4

6108548,0,t1_cyjyrp4,Ah then take those accusations that seem pointed at you and point them at a theoretical person who genuinely believes the things you said.There are normative conclusions which require some positive premises that are supported by evidence and there are normative conclusions which require some positive premises that are unsupported by evidence. The claims you made fall in the latter category. There are also few people in the United States who would admit to having the normative framework you describe. At worst their opposition to permissive immigration laws comes down to cognitive dissonance and they are convinceable. In my admittedly anecdotal experience people who have been around black Africans and muslims tend to like them a lot more than people who have not been around them.Muslims might be socially conservative but there are many many other aspects of their culture that they import. The benefits of that would outway the harms. There are also distinct generational differences in immigrant politics and I have heard that immigrant voting patterns dont neatly follow ideological boundaries. This mitigates and maybe even reverses any negative effect an immigrant would have on the ideological landscape with respect to things like womens rights. And this might be another area where I am drawing from personal experience but I have met a lot of young second generation Muslim immigrants. I went to undergrad and high school in two suburbs with a much higher proportion of Muslims than the national average. They were not especially opposed to gay rights or womens rights. Finally while I dont personally agree with social conservatism it isnt like you arent allowed to have that belief. I also want to apologize for the terse tone of my last post. I didnt see what you were trying to do and genuinely thought you were a racist. ,badeconomics,cyjz9qw,2,t5_2wbw4

6278861,0,t1_cz36du0,gt Its easy to rule out a simple baseline rational model. Its hard to differentiation between a bunch of really complicated rational models a bunch of different psychological effects and people having really weird preferences.I find this critique a litle bizarre. It just doesnt fit the world that I see. Im sure there are plenty of crappy behavioral papers. But the top papers the ones that get in the AER or QJE or are just authored by people like Mullainathan Laibson Dellavigna or Chetty generally go to somewhat absurd lengths demonstrating that the behavior they are discussing isnt a product of some wacky equilibrium.For example I have some ongoing work on medical adherence. In order to publish it Id have to write a section demonstrating that medical adherence isnt a product of people forgetting stuff from time to time but show that they are not refusing to take their medicine in order to demonstrate their health to potential mates. Not that anyone actually thinks that this is actually happening but because some reviewer will always come up with a wacky story.Most papers Im familiar with have a section where they go through alternative models that could explain the behavior being discussed and show why those models dont fit the full data with  tables.Heres a good example  Self Control at Work by Kaur Kremer Mullainathan This is a paper looking at how workers are hyperbolic discounters and how they will contracts that are strictly worse than others in order to force themselves to work harder in the future. Section VII Alternative Explanations goes into soome detail about other models that could generate their headline results and how those models are not consistent with other data they collectedgt The results described in the previous section are consistent with the predictions of our model. Wenow turn to evaluate whether these results could plausibly be explained by reasons other thantime inconsistency. While various alternate explanations may explain individual effects weargue none can explain the full pattern of results production increases on paydays demand fordominated contracts and treatment effects of Choice the correlation between the payday andcontract effects differences between evening and morning choice mediated by uncertaintycorrelation of the contract effects with other measures of selfcontrol and time trends includingthe differences in takeup over time among high and low payday difference workers. Forconcreteness we apply this argument to several potential alternate explanations below.My general impression is that the modal behavioral paper that I use and cite with any regularity has exactly this section.

This assumes an ever increasing standard of living and discounts things that affect a persons ability to purchase their basic needs. Hypothetically what if healthcare is completely free by then? Should the minimum wage still increase? What if we find a neverending energy source that is almost free? Should the minimum wage still increase? More realistically what if we go into a deflationary cycle in ? Should minimum wage still increase?gt Mrs. Clinton has argued that  might be too high for employers in lowwage states causing them to lay off workers or make fewer hires. There is no proof for or against that position.Without going into a million papers on either direction this article statesgt The D.C. Chamber of Commerce released a poll of business owners in which more than half of the respondents said they would cut jobs if the minimum wage rose to .And thats in DC which is probably much better equipped to handle such a high minimum wage than most of the country. I mean shouldnt we be at least a bit concerned? Maybe the NYT Editorial board could have waited a year or two before endorsing the idea.A  minimum wage would put the US on top of the minimum wage chart by PPP by about  over the current leader San Marino with .. This is a huge increase and will disproportionally affect some industries restauranters to begin with than others. I thought we were all for small businesses and momandpop shops. Apparently  not at NYT HQ. Sure for some monopsonies the minimum wage would stick although even thats contentious and the monopsony would transfer the increased cost of labor to its customers and sharehol hahaha no they wouldnt transfer it to their shareholders who am I kidding.We havent even talked about automation inflation and disruption to the existing businesses yet.And some words from people who know economics more than I doAlso the comment history of ubesttrousers.,badeconomics,d035ly7,65,t5_2wbw4

6643807,0,t1_d06hjwx,I dont know maybe Im a different sort of person on the left but I see their set of policies to be the most pragmatic way to run the nation.  I dont think the United States has a chance of thriving let alone surviving without a strong middle class.  Its too tied up with the ethos of America.  I see this course towards greater and greater inequality as dangerous and it will tear America apart.  People have an inherent sense of fairness and if they feel like theyre getting the short end of the stick they wont sit around idle stewing in it.  They will act in a variety of ways.  And inequality tests its citizens sense of fairness.  So if this continues I can see subsets of Americans viewing other subsets as not on the same team.  America doesnt have a long history.  There isnt really a majority ethnic group.  The only thing tying Americans together with other Americans is this idea that well all get rich together or at least middle class.  So dont rock the boat!  But if that changes I dont think America can survive for long.  Thats where Im coming from with all of this.  I dont have or try not to have any morality bound to my politics.  Its like if a robot were to run the nation.  So immigration and trade from my point of view is seen as How will it benefit Americans in the short term and the long term?

He obviously entered the league with high expectations although he was just  years old when he started playing in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers.However McDavid didnt have the strongest start to the season. Had a bit of an adjustment period getting used to playing with the big boys. Thats when somebody on the hockey subreddit posted thisgtIts still early in the season I know...gtBut maybe the kid just isnt ready for the NHL yet? With the media hounding him the pressure of being considered the next great one fuck I wouldnt be able to handle that shit.gtMaybe having him in the minors for another year or two to develop a bit wouldnt have been a bad idea.

How dare I say such blasphmey after only THREE games. Youre right he may only be  years old but he has the emotional maturity of a Buddhist monk and the body and athleticism as a top olympic athlete. He may have hit puberty only  to  years ago but he is a grown man now capable of all pressure and criticism that comes his way.gtI am but a lowly neckbeard maple leafs fan who lives in my mothers basement here to shit on him for not getting  goals in his first  games.

Thank you for showing me the error of my ways with you jamming the downvote arrow on your computer screen with all your might and telling me how much of an idiot I am.Well turns out that  games isnt enough to judge a player because soon after that was posted McDavid started wrecking shit up and fulfilled his expectations.

Educators typically do try to communicate  values tools for understanding the world etc.  I dont think its necessarily possible to convey information in an organized fashion without that.  Hell by teaching X as a subject youre inherently conveying that X is important and worthy of study all the more so when X is a mandatory part of the curriculum. For example I dont think an American law school could effectively teach U.S. law without inculcating a fundamental sense of the importance of due process.  You cant teach law without explaining the principles and reasoning behind it.  You cant be an effective lawyer without command of the methodology of legal reasoning but legal reasoning is not neutral from a values proposition.  ,badeconomics,d10u2iq,2,t5_2wbw4

Labor mobility labor migration helps the local labor market by reducing labor supply and increasing local wages or by remitting income back to communities improving the situation of those who remain.But the effect on tax base is not so clear cut. The reduction in population reduces municipal income while municipal liabilities  remain largely fixed. Rising wages also hurt municipalities as municipal wages rise. Whatever increased income we have available  for infrastructure like those highlighted in HCSK better primary schools better social services better infrastructure which separate lands of opportunity from lands of stagnation is small. Differences in mobility are driven by factors that affect children while they are growing up. Ill agree with you on that. And yes labor mobility helps and yes labor mobility improves access to these facilities for some who move with a healthy dose of ceterus paribus but its not a panacea for those who remain.The trivial question why cant everyone move?

7146329,0,t1_d1q81ug,A lot of the difference comes in the change of interpretation with the parameter as the random variable instead of the sample.For example this makes the equivalent of a confidence interval more natural as it is saying theres an X chance that the parameter lies in a given range instead of X of all confidence intervals from every possible sample from the population will contain the true value.It lets you marginalise over parameters and models to incorporate extra uncertainty in your estimates.It lets you incorporate prior information and then update estimates as new data comes in.It lets you bring expected type  and type  error losses into hypothesis testing rather than just using . as an adhoc way to balance the probability of each event.Latent variables are easy to model as you can treat them as another random parameter. Im not familiar with frequentist latent variables so this might not be an advantage.I think most of why its rising right now comes into the fact that most bayesian inference requires computationally difficult integration that wasnt really available in the past.,badeconomics,d1qgo9r,1,t5_2wbw4

I think thats how it works. If you see here Bloomberg shows Bear Sterns and AIGs CDSs climb during the anxiety in . So then why does the ABX.HE which is just averaging a basket of CDS prices show that as price goes up confidence goes up gtYeah so risk free debt is kind of a cheat. In economics  or finance  you might hear about the risk free rate. It doesnt actually exist but to any useful approximation it does.Oh I see. Ive been reading that actual interest rates are basically a pure interest rate and some liquidity and default risk premiums on top of it. gtHOW DEEP INTO THIS DO YOU WANT TO GO!!?!!?ALL THE WAY! So the CDS approximates the risk by requiring premium payments of some  measured in basis points of the notional face value of the debt being insured. That  will reflect the perceived chances of default. The smaller this  the more confidence in the debt and the closer the fair value ? is to par. Is that what the ABX is measuring this fair value? That book you recommended says the protection payment equals the difference between par and the price of the assets of the reference entity on the face value of the protection and compensates the buyer for the loss.

Obama came into office essentially at the same time the housing bubble crashed the mess he was elected into. In response the Fed dropped the interest rates down to nearly  in an attempt to stimulate the economy by making it significantly easier to borrow money. This is equivalent to bringing out the big guns as far as governments role in the economy and largely kept the economy from collapsing. In response many companies used these low interest rates to expand infrastructure and grow their businesses gas is cheap right now because companies expanded their operations increased supply and then demand collapsed in China and Europe hence why weve seen some luke warm growth during Obamas presidency rather than the total collapse that people were expecting.Theres nothing obviously wrong so far. Its imprecise but this is reddit not a journal.But waitgt However these rates have remained unchanged for the entire Obama presidency and keeping them this low for an extended period can lead to bubbles of their own. This is starting to look fishy. Here comes the turn...gt Just look at the housing market right now in most big cities house prices are clearly overinflated as more people are buying homes with low interest rate mortgages and a spending bubble as people take false security and even loans against their home equity. We essentially have another housing crisis in the pipeline as the Fed necessarily needs to inch up the interest rates in order to reload the low interestrate weapon. When this happens the new housing bubble will pop businesses will contract and the Fed wont have any ammo in the interest rate gun to shoot so well be fucked. The equity market bubble thats been held up by the transfer of money out of interest bearing instruments will pop banks will be in a new crisis with no bailout and jobs which were never properly corrected from lowered interest rates and workforce participation will plummet even furtherI count a minimum of four really important things wrong here.

7461785,0,t3_4hjcam,Ok so I have a question about excess reserves oh boy. It seems to me the common view here is that banks dont lend excess reservessortof. That being the case is Friedman wrong in this quotegtDavid Laidler Many commentators are claiming that in Japan with short interest rates essentially at zero  monetary policy is as expansionary as it can get but has had no stimulative effect on the economy. Do you have a view on this issue?gtMilton Friedman Yes indeed. As far as Japan is concerned the situation is very clear. And its a good example. Im glad you brought it up because it shows how unreliable interest rates can be as an indicator of appropriate monetary policy.gtDuring the s you had the bubble period. Monetary growth was very high. There was a socalled speculative bubble in the stock market. In  the Bank of Japan stepped on the brakes very hard and brought money supply down to negative rates for a while. The stock market broke. The economy went into a recession and its been in a state of quasi recession ever since. Monetary growth has been too low. Now the Bank of Japans argument is Oh well weve got the interest rate down to zero what more can we do?gtIts very simple. They can buy longterm government securities and they can keep buying them and providing highpowered money until the high powered money starts getting the economy in an expansion. What Japan needs is a more expansive domestic monetary policy.gtThe Japanese bank has supposedly had until very recently a zero interest rate policy. Yet that zero interest rate policy was evidence of an extremely tight monetary policy. Essentially you had deflation. The real interest rate was positive it was not negative. What you needed in Japan was more liquidity.Am I misinterpreting Friedman here? He seems to imply that the excess reserves this would create would go into the economy. Or is he looking through a different channel like Mr. Bernke was with QE?In this case was Friedman envisioning a permanent increase in the monetary base or was he implying that the balance sheet of the central banks would be able to shrink after the monetary expansion.This is kind of interesting as a lot of economists today claim QE wasnt very effectivedidnt work at all and if that is true it seems to have large implications for the power of monetary policy. Like would the Fed have been able to get the US out of the Depression through conventional means? Or was Krugman right in saying it wasnt so cut and dryAlthough I know Friedman said there was evidence of the economy expanding after the Fed conducted OMOs in ,badeconomics,d2qcxcy,6,t5_2wbw4

Apparently it matters to your friend.Thats what the trade deficit  current account surplus really means The money that flows out to buy goods for import flows back in as investments.Now weve got enough rules and regulations to probably prevent a Chinese conglomerate from buying the Empire State Building tearing it down and replacing it with a giant statue of Mao. But its a lot more potentially possible for a Chinese conglomerate to do a hostile take over of Apple and move their headquarters and development to Shenzen. Though Im sure the SEC and FTC would have their say. After all American companies do that kind of stuff all the time. Sometimes they buy the company and shut it down or move the headquarters from overseas to the states other times the move the headquarters from one US state to another. Is it worse if the Chinese are doing it than the Californians? In some ways yes because I cant just follow my job to China the way I could to California. But in other ways not necessarily because my job might simply be eliminated instead of moved or I might not want to move.So yeah its an opinion.,badeconomics,d2st4uu,2,t5_2wbw4

Some of the inflation was because of war some of the deflation was because of post war prices settling. Some of the inflation was because of booms some because of prolonged economic downturns. gtThere was nothing like the great depression or the great recession in the th century lolIn all seriousness A second factor to be considered in historical comparison partially offsets this tendencynamely the diminished role of farm employment. In  farmers were more numerous than manufacturing employees today they constitute less than a third. Since unemployment on the farm customarily tends to take the form of underemployment the expected float of visible unemployment today would tend to be higher because of the shift to urban employmentThe paper has a section of unemployment rates by year and includes rates for nonfarm unemployment which significantly increases the rate. Using nonfarm as the measurement makes the Great Depressions peak unemployment . not .. Generally speaking subsistence and small scale commercial farmers are hard to make unemployed.

7504674,0,t1_d2v3rff,If I owned a supermarket with  employees that Im paying  an hour and I had to increase that by  an hour Id be spending an extra  per hour  per day or  per month in salaries. My general manager was making  an hour and now wants a  raise as compensation since she has more responsibilities than the cashier so Im facing even more salary pressure that Im not even going to factor in. Now I understand that a single store raising prices isnt going to cause inflation but were talking about a federal minimum wage which would effect every single business in the country that is paying its employees under  an hour. So now Im faced with  a month in additional costs to operating my businesswhether it goes up gradually or all at once Im facing these costs I have two options increase the price of the food to recoup my losses or run at a loss until I shut down the store. So now prices go up across the board for many businesses how is that not inflation?Many businesses dont necessarily scale when people have more money just because more people have extra cash in their pockets doesnt mean that they are going to spend a proportional amount of that increased money at certain businesses. The amount of laundry someone has to do is not going to increase the amount of food many people buy may not go up the number of TVs they buy bus trips they take heat that they use may not increase. Those businesses will raise their prices to compensate or they will lose money. If my supermarket was profitable by  and that was my take home salary from running that store which i took all the risks and work into creating Im faced with raising prices to continue making my cut OR I have a lower salary which makes my buying power drop significantly since the price of everything just went up.And what about people who become unemployed during this? They are going to need additional assistance to account for stores raising their prices. And the big stores who may be able to take the loss like Walmart well they can keep their prices low and strangle out competition even faster than they already do. ,badeconomics,d2v8qy2,5,t5_2wbw4

7598833,1,t1_d35od33,In the long run it does. A country is spending more than it gets in. If you look at the data trade deficits start pretty much shortly after government spending deficits start. In the short run you can have a spending surplus but in the end the money has to come from somewhere?Unless a country had large savings and they are spending those a trade deficit has to be funded by debt. And the only part that can consistently do that in the long run on a large enough scale to explain the deficit is the government. Pretty basic logic not sure why I am being downvoted. At first a trade deficit will cut into savings as a country goes from not feeling that rich to feeling rich than net savings turn into debt. Here is a history of the deficit and a history of government spending.As you can see up until the s  the trade deficit was very small or there was a surplus accounting for massive inflation in the s. Inflation went down after the s and the budget deficit as a  of GDP went up and incidentally the trade deficit exploded too. You see the same pattern with other countries.I mean in the end the money has to come from somewhere right? The country as a whole takes  more value from other countries than it provides inflation adjusted. Very simply logic that this is not sustainable. And this has to either come from debt or from savings. Savings in the US have been tapped out so debt is pretty much the only option. This whole oh a massive trade deficit is totally sustainable! thing reminds me of when economists claimed housing prices would keep going up and almost no economist thought there could possibly be a bubble in the mid s. I thought this was sort of common sense but i guess I am posting in bad economics.

The rhetorical flourishes as you say show someone whos not connected with the meaning of terms theyre introducing.  As for Acemoglus work Im reading the paper now but high tax rates are obviously going to correlate with higher per capita GDP since GDP usually includes governmental spending.  Also genuine question is a high GDP automatically closer to a Pareto optimality?  I didnt think it was.And on a more political level Id say that those wartorn states with lower tax rates only have lower tax rates because of difficulties collecting tax receipts and political realities of opposition.  South Koreans as referenced by the paper may in my opinion have less opposition to paying for public goods for other South Koreans but a wartorn state that contains two warring factions may not agree as easily that their tax rates should be as high.  He even mentions this The political power of the state depends on how easily citizens can replace a ruler who is pursuing policies detrimental to their interests.

This difference does not seem to be driven by knowledge since informing people of the expert opinions does not have much impact on the responses of ordinary Americans. The explanation most consistent with our limited evidence is that people do not trust many of the implicit assumptions embedded into the economists answers and that economists give them for granted.Economic Experts vs. Average AmericansgtSecond the effect of financial development on economic growth is bellshaped it weakens at higher levels of financial development. This weakening effect stems from financial deepening rather thanfrom greater access or higher efficiency. The empirical evidence also suggests that this weakening effect reflects primarily the impact of financial deepening on total factor productivity growth ratherthan on capital accumulation. Rethinking Financial Deepening Stability and Growth in Emerging MarketsgtAcademics view of the benefits of finance vastly exceeds societal perception. This dissonance is at least partly explained by an underappreciation by academia of how without proper rules finance can easily degenerate into a rentseeking activity. I outline what finance academics can do from a research point of view and from an educational point of view to promote good finance and minimize the bad. Does Finance Benefit Society?

In our main specification import competition explains onequarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment disability retirement and healthcare also rise sharply in more tradeexposed labor markets. The China Shock Learning from Labor Market Adjustment to Large Changes in TradegtThe  recession has intensified concerns about the consequences of workers job losses. To estimate the magnitude and temporal pattern of displaced workers earnings losses we exploit an unusual administrative data set that includes both employees quarterly earnings histories and information about their firms. We find that when hightenure workers separate from distressed firms their longterm losses average  percent per year. Further their losses mount even prior to separation are not limited to workers in a few industrial sectors and are substantial even forthose who find new jobs in similar firms. This evidence suggests that displaced workers earnings losses result largely from the loss of some unidentified attribute of the employment relationshipEarnings Losses of Displaced WorkersgtIn this paper we examine the negative relationship between the rate of growth of the financialsector and the rate of growth of total factor productivity. We begin by showing that bydisproportionately benefiting high collaterallow productivity projects an exogenous increase in financereduces total factor productivity growth. Then in a model with skilled workers and endogenous financialsector growth we establish the possibility of multiple equilibria. In the equilibrium where skilled labourworks in finance the financial sector grows more quickly at the expense of the real economy.

If she believed that economic forces needed to be concentrated in the hands of the State i think there are good reasons to believe that she still opposed centralized strong political power.Its hard to understand how economic forces can be concentrated in the hands of the state without some coercion and bureaucracy. Outside of our perception and need to organize our thoughts about society theres little about economic forces that makes them different from other human activity.Associated to every revolutionary movement in history going much further back than the th century you can find theorists  la Luxembourg whose personal humanistic views most would agree with. Im not sure the ability to cite them here or there can vindicate the whole movement when it goes off the rails.,badeconomics,d3kyw8o,13,t5_2wbw4

Tangentially on a different account I had an argument on neutral politics or political discussion sub about subsidizing small business as a grand idea for this century. I disagreed with the person by arguing that statistically a lot of small businesses fail at their inception it is difficult to determine what will be successful making the subsidy a waste and to a degree hurtful.

I do think the latter would increase in popularity if it were legalized and I still favor legalizing it but its a much more complicated topic than I originally viewed it as and am far less sure of my own views now a days.

You may not agree with them but its not badeconomics.Its clear that those against freetrade and the TPP dont like the fact that many lose their jobs many of these people will never retrain into a highly skilled service job and because the losers arent being compensated it isnt justified.Just because you are increasing efficiency by making the pie larger its mostly the richhigher income and capital owners that get most of the benefit.Being for or against trade depends on how you value welfare and efficiency. What I sometimes dont understand by the freetrade activists in this sub is that on one hand you seem to value higher and more progressive taxes which I dont disagree with because you want to reduce income inequality through redistribution and government spending on welfare programs.Then when it comes to freetrade you seem to value the fact that because youre increasing efficiency its awesome regardless of the American people that lose.The Scandinavian countries e.g. Denmark that have really high taxes and redistribution policies would objectively perform better with GDP and economic growth if they significantly lowered taxes and cut regulations but because they value welfare and equality more than efficiency theyre happy with the current setup.I hope this makes sense.

So I will explain why because Im guessing is what you want. Maybe start with a historical idea start to microfounded model was just a way to ignore real problem of methodology. When SonnenscheinMantelDebreu theorem pop up economist cant just continue to aggregate individual demand. So you have a real problem here how modelise demand and other macro stuff without all time refer to micro behavior ? But in the same timethat exactly what Keynes Sraffa and their other friend or not try to do so  this result was  not so terrible and macroeconomy just dont restart from nothing. Exept the fact that most of economist just didnt care about what we call Post Keynesian school now because they thought their method are bad perhaps false. So in this condition a really simple idea is put forward  no one say our individual fonction are false so lets use a representative agent with a individual fonction for consumption production and so on and we say his individual choice describe general choice. Problem solved and you dont have to work on real problem.I understand why this idea work so well microeconomy is something economist mastery in a way  and this methodology give you the feeling you can extend all this mastery for macroeconomy. But is just a feeling. For a simple reason macroeconomy dont work like microeconomy. If you think you can correctly describe what happen in macro level with micro analyse you are a fool. Isnt even because you are stupid or you understand nothing about economy that just because you cant. And isnt even hard to explain is even really well understand by a part of scientific word  principe of emergence. Thats a really simple idea just like we dont through walls as quantum particle some stuff happens in general level who dont happen in individual level and you cant explain it by just looking the individual level. And thats why I say this model misinformed because they give the illusion of explaination but by nature they cant explain properly what happen.Thats all I have to say I hope I give you enough information of what it mean to not support microfoundations. ,badeconomics,d4bjbie,2,t5_2wbw4

8082500,0,t1_d4o5nvc,Hey the article was shit and forbes and bloombergs measures of net worth are full of shortcuts for the sake of being able to take daily measurements of questionable accuracy to generate content.  I dont blame anyone in the thread who was getting confused least of all you.  As I said technically you were correct.  Were we dealing with literally any other asset like a company they own or what have you you would have been correct.  A drop in the value would have translated into a loss in their wealth since values of more permanent assets are harder to recover and there is a set liquidity to them we know how hard it would be to sell a company and we have a fair guess that the day to day value wont change that much outside of a sudden crisis.  But bloomberg was using just the net value of the stock market since they dont know many specific portfolios only a guesstimated or reported total investment in the stock market and the stock market isnt as liquid for the top  as it is for any of us.  In addition what was unclear was that the  billion loss was distributed throughout the top  the highest actual loss for an individual if we go by the bloomberg estimate was  billion tops.  And again this was mostly made back in a day once the shock wore off if it even needed to be made back many top investors hold stocks over a long term and day to day drops dont matter when the bottom of the dip wasnt even the lowest the stock markets been this YEAR.  The reason that the current value of stocks isnt typically used in accounting to track any kind of gains or losses is because it changes DAILY.  Even publicly traded companies only lump the net value of all of their stock in the market and record it as changes in the owners equity of a company which doesnt reflect any real concrete value only the measure of the net worth of a company.,badeconomics,d4ojpx7,1,t5_2wbw4

Inflation diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar at home and abroad and is a hidden tax on the American people. Moreover the inflation tax is regressive punishes those who save transfers wealth from Main Street to Wall Street and has grave implications for seniors living on fixed incomes.gtBecause the Federal Reserves monetary policy actions affect both inflation and economic activity those actions should be transparent. Moreover the Feds important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner. A free society demands that the sun shine on all elements of government. Therefore the Republican Party will work to advance substantive legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve the Federal Open Market Committee and the Feds dealings with foreign central banks. The first step to increasing transparency and accountability is through an annual audit of the Federal Reserves activities. Such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal Reserve remains insulated from political pressures and so its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than on political pressures for easy money and loose credit.gtDetermined to crush the doubledigit inflation that was part of the Carter Administrations economic legacy President Reagan shortly after his inauguration established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for U.S. currency. The commission advised against such a move. Now three decades later as we face the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current Administrations policies we propose a similar commission to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.No extremism here. s,badeconomics,d4ra4hz,28,t5_2wbw4

At a glance my answers That might be a good idea on its own merits but it does seem to shift the focus away from the original intent which is to have a strongly countercyclical measure narrowly targeted at involuntary unemployment. Which firms what jobs? Is it more... disruptive? distortionary? inefficient? not sure what word Im reaching for here to intervene directly in private sector activity to subsidize jobs?

For instance chocolate brown and black will almost never go together without a lot of help.  However khaki and black can go together quite nicely and so does charcoal and chocolate like I said earlieryou just have to make sure your watchshoesbelt combination tie your outfit together.

In the podcast whenever they spoke a Jewish name they put an echo on their voices.  It was a joke.  Once the media picked it up as if it were a super secret altright signal they encouraged it to get more intention and thats when the altright decided to react by intentionally using echos to trigger people.Edit  The podcast is called The Daily Shoah the guy goes by the name Ghoul on the internet.  He runs a popular facebook meme page called Countersignal Memes for Fashy Goys  If you go far enough back you can see them reacting to their echo meme getting traction.  Its interesting knowing how stories which have been picked up by the media actually went down.  The media is like a broken telephone.

Yes the CB can spend money on repurchasing their own bonds from domestic banks and increase the money supply but that only increases reserves if they also raise reserve requirements. Issuing sovereign bonds does not directly affect reserves or the overnight rate thought it does affect the money supplymultiplier.ampnbspIt is a huge burden and can slow growth depending on debt levels. It can also be a huge burden that increases growth well beyond the debt burden depending on the specifics of the situation. ampnbspYour Ben B. quote isnt actually referring to sovereign debt at all but instead refers to corporate debt between FDIC insured banks and the FED which is a completely different situation and he was referring to printing money to increase inflation.

Your Economist article says that lobbying has a solid return on investment. But campaign contributions generally dont have a high return. Lobbying and political contributions very often go together though More often than not lobbyists are able to arrange meetings with legislators precisely because it is standard for the lobbyist to also provide campaign funds in the same meeting. This is why the two activities are brought up in the same context and why lobbying is so effective. If youre curious This American Life has a very well researched podcast on how the two go together.As for the freakonomics link that is about how money effects the outcome of elections not whether campaign contributions influence legislators behavior.gtAnd as for the  crisis itd be silly to suggest that banks werent actively lobbying for favoritism and bailouts but the lax regulatory environment claim is a myth.Fair enough.

The price is k you pay k your monthly is .From a financial perspective highinterestrate markets with low sale prices allow you to buy out of your loan cheaper.  That is to say  if you put month extra on your k month year payment its a year mortgage.  If you have the k month year mortgage at the lower interest level you can get it paid off in  years... but you have to put month more additional prepayment down every month until its over.That means you can eliminate a highinterestrate loan with the same term and payment much more readily than a lowinterestrate loan given the same spendable income.,badeconomics,d6ph0c6,1,t5_2wbw4

Unfortunately I didnt get time for CS this semester... Freeing up those math classes which dont seem essential to econ I assume rings and groups etc have little significance for econ will allow me to get more CS classes but they may not be as early as you reccomend.

Behind this poor employment performance lies the phenomenon of eurosclerosis a labor market so clogged with government rules and regulations that European companies have had little incentive to create new jobs  especially the lowwage jobs that in the United States provide the young and minority groups with a first step into the world of work.

Furthermore some bosses simply may feel squeamish about the idea of firing people they know and like.In the old days bosses might have enjoyed busting heads to keep all the workers in line but in this softer millennial age well firing aversion is the order of the day if only to ease future recruitment and boost intangible capital and institutional continuity.EWWWW.This time varying firing aversion has a big time phacking feel.GMU has quirky ideas that are sometimes brilliant sometimes reek of phacking ideological trash. ,badeconomics,d7mqd6e,6,t5_2wbw4

9085975,0,t1_d83z48m,So a lot of Latin American countries for instance borrow in dollars while having their own currencies. If they wanted to do QE they can they buy their own bonds back. The bonds currency doesnt matter since the central bank is just buying an asset.It would affect the exchange rate because its a foreign currency asset. The peso loses value because theyre printing it to buy dollardenominated bonds.In practice a small economy which borrows in foreign currency typically does it for exchange rate reasons they buy dollars and dollardenominated debt to weaken their currency and strengthen their exports. Theres also the advantage of paying in a currency you cant print to oblivion so theres a bit of trust gained from the lenders who just want their coupon every quarter and dont want to worry about the peso going to zero against the dollar or euro.Theres nothing stopping such a country from doing QE and buying up those bonds but the condition of a country both borrowing in a foreign currency and printing local currency to purchase bonds is rather rare.

9117293,0,t1_d84gxfe,While it seems mostly like a diatribe Id just focus on one point you may want to rethink that is on promoting exports with stimulative monetary or fiscal policy to weaken the exchange rate. That usually works in the short term but on the longer term equilibrium factors start to set it and erode that monetary or fiscal effect. Note China for their monetary policies in perpetuating a weak currency and then get slammed with a lot of dumping duties as well as create a lot of uncompetitive companies like chinas entire steel industry. You can always artificially push exports up by devaluing currency but maintaining it over a longer span of time somehow always seems to encourage rent seekers and dispel innovation. So if US were to do this everyone in Asia would follow the race to the bottom with devaluing their own currency. Rather why not propose structural reforms to reduce export barriers encourage SMEs to set up with the goal to export and reduce regulations? Im just having a hard time accepting that governments know how businesses should be run. ,badeconomics,d87r1ql,1,t5_2wbw4

Although Hillarys childcare stuff is interesting and Johnson no longer supporting a carbon tax disappoints me.I know Johnson isnt an idiot. He was a fairly popular two term governor but the foreign policy gaffes have really bothered me. After the Aleppo moment I thought This isnt good but whatever. At least he had the humility to own up to it. It was probably a brain fart but then the other gaffe of foreign leaders came up and it reminded me of a Trump moment. In one of the primary debates Trump was asked about the nuclear triad. Unsurprisingly he had no idea what that was. Not good but of all the things to dislike about Trump pretty minor. A few months later he was asked the exact same question and again showed that he had still had no understanding of the nuclear triad. This was worrying because it belied Trump not taking issues seriously. When you become President you dont get to just focus on your big policy platform. You have to know a ton of shit and get into the nitty gritty stuff that doesnt interest you but its important. Now dealing with foreign leaders is a big fucking part of being President arguably the most important part. If Johnson hasnt shown an interest in that should I still support him? I like Johnson and would like to support him but this shit makes it hard. Theres also the issue that I want Trump to lose really badly to Hillary. Im not a fan of hers although I think shed be a fine President. Would voting for Hillary help keep Trump away from the Overton window?,badeconomics,d8je9t9,6,t5_2wbw4

However couldnt this just be due to attenuation bias from endogeneity? Perhaps there is a true causal effect but endogeneity biases the OLS estimates toward zero. Motu says correlation  causation but then forgets why we care about estimating causal effects in the first place.gtFor a country like NZ that relies mostly on exporting its natural resources having more people simply means dividing the pie among more people.Because those extra people add zero net value to the economy amirite? Why do opponents of immigration frequently assume immigrants just come here work like robots hoard their money and never spend or start businesses?

Money does not go out of existence when used to pay off a debt.A owes a debt to B who owes a debt to C who owes a debt to D who owes a debt to E  who owes a debt to F...A wins x in a casino and pays it to B who pays it to C who pays it to D who pays it to E who pays it to F who blows it in the other casino across the street.The same x of money has paid off x of debt and is still flowing onward to get kicked out of some slot machine maybe and from there who knows?,badeconomics,dcenjv2,6,t5_2wbw4

10344137,1,t1_dcgjdnj,gt Thats still not true. Welfare recipients are a net outlay for the government thats sortof the point. So even an entity paying very little tax Im struggling to imagine an entity which pays no tax. Thats not true even of Amazon contributes more.It would depend on what is meant by tax if were talking about capital gains for individuals corporate income tax or all forms of federal tax reciepts e.g. employer payed payroll tax. That said there are major companies who have no federal corporate income tax liabilities.gtThose above median income and corporations contribute far more tax revenue than those on welfare. Its not even close. True probably some figurative language targeted at the privilege of . who make money from being wealthy its possible to make passive income from capital gains yet have no liability by offsetting losses. Im not saying its unworthy of correction but I understand the sentiment.gt Saving is just hoarding money and therefore doesnt contribute anything and  the goal of economic policy should always and everywhere be increased spending. Because of the recession and the fucus on aggregate demand in the last decade its something a lot of people have fallen victim to. Savings and consumption should each be somewhere between  and  to borrow from a similar thought experiment with the Laffer curve. We could even disaggregate to talk about savings and consumption rates for different income percentiles. but to borrow from the Laffer curve there is hypothetically some optimal sweet spot that gives the best stable return i.e. we can be either at the left or the right of the curve. So too then should we expect there to exist such a state for the ratio of savings to consumption. I dont think anyone is seriously advocating all consumption and no savings.Edit There was this one wealthy guy who paid no tax and became president of something but I cant remember who it was.,badeconomics,dcgkelh,1,t5_2wbw4

11203894,0,t1_df1fsd6,Thank you  refreshing to see a valuable contribution to the conversation.Yes I agree. I find overwhelmingly that there is an attempt to pretend that the increase in the money supply if managed properly has no negative effect on the CPIPCE but rather has a positive effect. This is a disingenuous phrasing and yet confirmed by smart economists. It most certainly does have a negative effect on savings in the sense that what would have been a  growth of savings is now . I just had someone reply to another comment that the real interest rate is really what matters not just the rate of inflation. Thats bull shit. Just because the real interest rate is positive doesnt mean that the purchasing power of my savings isnt being taken away and spent somewhere else. It seems people are very very afraid to admit that the federal reserve contributes to an increase in the money supply and therefore affects the prices of goods often disallowing them from going down in favor of keeping them about the same but just going up slowly while at the same time growing the economy.,badeconomics,df1y3pd,-8,t5_2wbw4

11276792,0,t1_dfa68om,The Court isnt unlimited in its power to interpret the Constitution. Like with government policy generally the Court is incremental and changes are made at the margin rather than at the core. The Court is still reliant on the government to execute its opinions. And it is still restrained by the court of public opinion in that the legitimacy of the Court is a binding constraint on the power of the Court. If the legitimacy is weakened the power is weakened. And the Court is still constrained by the political process when justices are replaced. The originalists which in reality are the liberals are working within  years of Court tradition and many s of years of common law tradition and precedent. Brown v. and Roe v. are consistent with precedent. Hobby Lobby was not. In the long run Hobby Lobby will be overturned. Almost the whole of the Roberts Court decisions will be overturned.

11374129,0,t3_62a5qz,gt Banks do not lend out deposits. When a bank makes a loan it creates an asset the loan and a liability the deposit ex nihilo. This results in newly created money that didnt exist previously. The borrower obtains newly created deposits. Not the deposits of any other depositor.OK your bank has no available capital to use to fund a loan and no cash or free reserves from deposits either.  But you dont need them so you issue a loan repayable some years from now  ex nihilo out of thin air nothing.  Your customer uses the loan for a transaction and the check you issued gets deposited at Chase which pays out cash on it.  Chase then clears the check back to you so you can transfer the corresponding amount of cash or reserves to it  but you dont have any to send.  Your next move is ... call a lawyer?Maybe you think you can suddenly rush into into some market and borrow against the loans asset value to pay off Chase?  Sorry whatever you can get is going to be seriously discounted for time and risk you are bust.  If anyone will lend on any terms at all to a bank that acts like you.  And the regulators will be displeased with you.Banks make loans against assets so checks can clear immediately. Capital deposits reserves are not thin air.  You have to get them and they are not free.  Make loans from nothing and collect a Go Directly to Jail card.gt The bank is not acting as an intermediary allowing one depositor to lend his money to the borrower. So when a bank run causes bank deposits to collapse it doesnt reduce the banks ability to lend because it doesnt lend out deposits to begin with.  The Bailey Savings amp Loan wasnt really intermediating everybodys savings into their neighbors home loans George only foolishly thought he was doing that as he did it. gtgt I dont buy MMT.  All this reminds me of an entertaining exchange with a prominent MMTer I had some while back.  He explained to me that when the government deficit spends the real process is  contrary to the common view  that the money borrowed by issuing bonds is exterminated upon receipt by the government then new money is created from nothing when the government spends it into the economy.  I said sort of like Death amp Resurrection.  He said Yes I like that!.  I said Of the same amount of money.  He said Yes.  I said Or alternatively the govt just spends the same money it borrowed.  Occams razor same result without any religious intervention.OK here loans must be made against assets  capital deposited funds borrowed reserves  so checks can clear and the standard commonplace view is that deposits are the dominating asset used to fund lending.  Ergo a lack of deposits will constrain lending and a bank run with deposits flooding out will reduce lending.  Thus the standard picture is that a banks lending will equal a high percentage of its deposits since deposits fund lending but be less than  as a percentage will be withheld by each bank to cover cash operating needs protect against varying risks of lending etc.But now we have the heterodox saying no no banks dont lend deposits at all! reality is entirely different ... it just coincidentally results in the same objective fact that the loandeposit ratio  is quite high but less than  and varies by bank as each bank says it loans an amount less than deposits in line with particular cash needs and varying risks of lending.  Just as if the bankers actually are funding loans with deposits which is what they say they are doing.  But what would they know?The nub Bank lending must be backed with liquid assets capital deposits reserves so checks can clear promptly and as they are real things it is not from nothing thin air ex nihilo.  Beyond that Occams razor is good enough for me.  Until someone points me to the banks with consistent loandeposit ratios over  to show that they really are lending from something substantial other than deposits.gt One final point that might be worth emphasizing. This is an entirely theoretical post because there are no empirical implications of this disagreement over how banking works ...Yeah. Thats always worth getting so excited about.,badeconomics,dfl8k0t,2,t5_2wbw4

11501904,0,t3_6443ye,Tyler Cowen on BrexitgtAs I interpret what happenedultimately the vote was about preserving the English nation and yes I use those last two italicized words deliberatelyreread Fintan OToole. Go back and read English history. For centuries England has been filled with English people plus some others from nearby regions. Go visit Norfolk and also stop inGreat Yarmouth once described by Charles Dickens as the finest place in the universe and which for whatever decline it may have experienced still looks and feels like England.London does not.. . .gt London the cultural center business center and political capital of England for many centuries is now essential a global and indeed foreign city. I spent almost two weeks in London in  and while I clearly prefer the new version the difference is glaringly obvious to me as I am sure it is all the more to most English people. And that contrast is clearest to the older English of course and that helps explain one of the most pronounced demographic features of how people voted it is inappropriate how many Remain supporters are cursing the arguably better informed preferences of the elderly.. . .gt And if you are thinking that voting Leave does not at all limit Pakistani immigration you are truly missing the point this vote was the one lever the English were given for sending a message to their politicians.. . .gt All of this migration has brought a cultural trauma arguably more significant than anything for England since the Norman Conquest. In factunder a lot of estimatesthe Norman Conquest was no more than about  menrelative to an estimated English population of . million at that time.gt Quite simply the English want England to stay relatively English and voting Leave was the instrument they were given. That specific cultural attachment is not for IrishAmerican me no I feel no sentiment other than perhaps good humor when someone offers me a lovely biscuit or when a small book shop devotes an entire section to gardening but yes I do get it at some level. And some parts of the older England I do truly love and I am talking the Beatles and Monty Python and James Bond here not just the ancients like Trollope or Edmund Spenser.gt Much has been made of the supposed paradox thatopposition to immigration is highest where the number of immigrants is lowest. Yes some of that is the racism and xenophobia of less cosmopolitan areas but it would be a big mistake to dismiss it as such or even to mainly frame it as such.Most of all it is an endowment effect. Those are the regions which best remember  and indeed still live  some earlier notion of what England was like. And they wish to hold on to that albeit with the possibility of continuing evolution along mostly English lines.gt One way to understand the English vote is to compare it to other areas especially with regard to immigration. If you read Frank Fukuyama he correctly portrays Japan and Denmark as along with England being the two other truly developed mature nation states in earlier times well before the Industrial Revolution. And what do we see about these countries? Relative to their other demographicsthey are especially opposed to very high levels of immigration. England in a sense was the region out on a limb when it comes to taking in foreigners and now it has decided to pull back and be more like Denmark and Japan.gt The regularity here is that the coherent longstanding nation states are most protective of their core identities. Should that come as a huge surprise? The contrast with Belgium where I am writing this is noteworthy. The actual practical problems with immigration are much greater here in Brussels but the country is much further from doing anything about it whether prudently or not and indeed to this day Belgium is not actually a mature nationstate and it may splinter yet.That England did something is one reflection of the fact that England is a betterrun region than Belgium even if you feel as I do that the vote was a big mistake.gt Of course USA and Canada and a few others are mature nation statesbased on the very idea of immigration so they do not face the same dilemma that England does. By the way the most English of the colonies  New Zealand  has never been quite as welcoming of foreign immigrants compared to say Australia.. . .gt Restoring and maintaining what is English? Too little too late! says I you should instead find a way of strengthening and redefining English identity under the status quo ex ante I might have added but of course I was not given the deciding vote or indeed any vote at all.gt Most of all I conclude that the desire to preserve the English nation sic as English is stronger than I or indeed most others had thought. There is a positive side to that. And if all along you thought there was no case for Leave probably it is you who is the provincial one.,badeconomics,dfzqoe2,22,t5_2wbw4

11515454,0,t1_dg0ufxa,I dont understand why you say a preference cant be formed in this situation. And then say if you do have such a preference its exogenous. You gave probably the simplest case which is like the Markovian case dunno if you guys use that word in economics where the preferences of the individual depend only upon the current state of the world. So for identical allocations you can have different utility depending on the overall state of the world. Why cant we have a preference about identical allocations under different states of the world? As you say its like at each timestep having preferences over stateallocation pairs. Why is that exogenous? As you move forward in time there is some mechanism where your preferences change in a way that is affected by the state of the world. That sounds endogenous. Then you might be able to rewrite the whole thing as exogenous preferences over the set of all complete histories of the world. So theres some kind of formal equivalence. But asapplied those models are very different. In one you only have to input some initial preferences plus some rules about updating preferences over time. In the other you have to guess ahead of time what the behavior of preferences over time will be and input the complete picture at the beginning. If you dont already know how the preferences will change over time the exogenous rewriting is useless.This way of thinking about it makes it seem like theres just no distinction between exogenous and endogenous preferences because you can always rewrite endogenous preferences as exogenous preferences over histories. But that doesnt seem like a useful endogenousexogenous distinction. ,badeconomics,dg1a0z2,1,t5_2wbw4

11684183,0,t1_dgkawja,Youre not alone. Many teenage idealogues feel the same way when introduced to economics. You should remember capitalism is a word that was made up by socialists to describe notsocialism. Given only a couple dozen countries have genuinely good living standards economists tend to study the institutions in those countries when trying to come up ideas about how to improve living standards. By definition these countries are not socislist. This may be the reason you perceive economics the way you do. You see economists as evangelizing about what you call capitalism. But that word is what socialists call any economy that isnt one of the handful of socialist countries. To most economists the word doesnt mean a whole lot. They study economies. To them its totally normal to suggest copying successful countries.
