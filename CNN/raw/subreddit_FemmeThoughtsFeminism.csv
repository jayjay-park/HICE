1007846,0,t3_25mobj,I find it ridiculous how some people MRAs cough cough oh did i say something think things like this are Going Too Far. Like people are always saying that women should be taking steps to prevent rape and that its unfair for women to be uneasy around men in general because not all men are rapists. Isnt having a little list of people that are rapists that you ought to be careful around a good start?,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,chiulrr,5,t5_2uiyy
1084068,0,t1_chriab3,Why on earth do you think anyone cares about your feelings about what strangers wear?I can see balls and penis through a great many mens bathings suits and sports shorts. Do you hear about how distracting that is ever? No. Because staring at peoples genitals particularly those of people you dont know is inappropriate in pretty much every setting ever.You pretty definitely need to figure out your relationship with both sexual selfcontrol and objectification. Unfortunately this is not a support forum for men. There are a number of subs out there for men to talk about these issues and I recommend you do. Do some reading on the topics on your own time. I recommend also looking through what derailing is on the sidebar and familiarizing yourself with that. Further comments about your pantsfeels will be deleted as they are not on topic to the post. ,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,chrieck,9,t5_2uiyy
1111240,0,t3_26ugzy,For those interested theres a text semitranscript by Watson the video creator at Skepchick I think the text better conveys her actual thought than the video does Edit sorry uAerik I thought usantaansucks was the OP. Removed this section.Her point was that the question itself is framed in such a way as to get a reflexive no answer  and such an answer is incredibly easy to deal with. Instead she rewords the question thuslygtShould people be allowed a sick day when they are feeling unwell enough to not be able to do their jobs? I say yes. That goes for anyone who has debilitating bleeding or cramping. If a man went to his boss and said Im bleeding so much that I have to change these bandages every hour or two I have constant diarrhea and cramping so bad that I cant get out of the fetal position I would argue that that guy should go home and feel better.And I agree with her  I am from Australia so Im used to having a government that gives something of a damn about workers rights but if you are too ill to do your job you should be free to take sick leave. No its not menstrual leave any more than one takes heartattack leave or Iamfillingthetoiletwithwateryfaeces leave.The fact that its framed as menstrual leave is just to frame the argument in a manner that can ignore the entire concept of sick leave and how that pertains to the rights of both men and women and Watson is calling them out on it.,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,chulu4c,17,t5_2uiyy
1144753,0,t3_2781jv,The ironic thing is that high waisted pants actually go around your waist. My hips are not my waist. Im wearing jeans right that are low rise and I have to worry about my underwear and stomach sticking out because they do not actually go up to my waist but a little above my hips. For the price they were the best ones for me besides that though so I deal If my jeans went to my waist then people like this guy wouldnt even be able to tell because unlike the girl in the picture I am wearing a shirt and what is under my shirt is not anybodys business.Oh erm but men should stop telling women how to dress etc. But seriously your waist is not below your stomach. ,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,chyeahc,8,t5_2uiyy

1854267,0,t1_ckck0ef,I agree and thats something the article really falls short on. Women grow up speaking and are told over and over to sit down and shut up. A woman can press back but is bombasted over and over by the male dominant narrative.  Eventually that woman gets to the point where she makes a decision to endure shit for speaking or remains silent because she knows the effort is wasted on ears that refuse to listen. Its the dominant groups responsibility to listen to the minority yet the opposite is happening. Now Im reading that the minority group should just speak up more. Good article but thats not the problem and is a joke of a solution.,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,ckcmun1,12,t5_2uiyy

4205512,0,t1_crzleh9,gt Is my gender identity invalid in this hypothetical even if a highly certain test says that its wrong?If  and were getting really speculative here  this were the case then I would consider your identity no more valid than the cliche response of well what if I think Im a dog. The biological basis is precisely why trans people have validity and someone who thinks theyre a dog does not.gt Would you really support refusing transition to someone who failed the test even if its what they want and feel is best for themselves? How is that ethical?Because theres no justification for providing a treatment you have good reason to belief will not be beneficial. The whole reason we have things like prescriptions is the assumption that there are limits on peoples ability to evaluate the proper medical decisions for themselves in lieu of expertise in the field.,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,crzm91c,2,t5_2uiyy
5037330,0,t1_custu9o,gthas nothing at all to do with the male gazeTo be totally fair a lot of the particular dances and costumes chosen are absolutely for the male gaze with a large focus on how sexy the performance is.That said I completely agree that it is truly a sport thats in no way comparable to breastaurants and an insanely physically demanding one at that. Its gymnastics at its core. But I mean the choreography chosen absolutely has to do with male gaze in many cases.It is entirely possible to choreograph and dress cheerleaders in a way that doesnt appeal to the male gaze and I wish there was more that simply showcased the sheer talent that these women have instead of focusing on whether or not its sexy enough.,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,cut6ueo,6,t5_2uiyy

7356632,0,t1_d2ebf1p,Okay so Vermonts had transfriendly policies going on  or  years now without incident. Some LA school boards have had them in place since the mid s without incident. Massachussetts has since  iirc and I can only remember one incident in Boston that iirc was nearly a decade ago. These predators will do what they do no matter what. A california man dressed up like a woman to do his voyeur shit years before transfriendly policies went statewide. The narrative for some of them might shift from them silently trying to sneak in unnoticed to being a bit more willing to be seen but the rate of these incidents hasnt changed anywhere these policies have been put in place. You can point at one or two examples and assert that theres not only a trend but that its caused by these policies and I can point at hundreds of collective years of data that says otherwise. The only thing that couldnt have happened otherwise in such cases is them being able to say theyre trans but that is tied to history and not any specific policy it virtually never lifts scrutiny among the people attending the washrooms it never passes for legit with law enforcement or the courts and its hardly different than the predators just finding slightly better timing to sneak in undetected. Theres absolutely a problem at hand with these predators but transfriendly bills do not make it easier for them to get away with what they do and theyre not doing this shit more often so theres no added practical risk. Like I feel for folks who are concerned and who are worried and scared especially people who have suffered sexual traumas. But theres no added risk to these laws and policies. Just harm reduction. And putting fears above real material harm towards a vulnerable demographic whose lives can be made much safer? Thats just not right. Again the issue here is that trans people exist and more people know about us and that makes folks uncomfortable and might hypothetically make a few predators weaponize that exposure temporarily in hopes of getting what they want and no bill...protrans or antitrans...would be able to keep that from happening. Again a cis guy could say hes transgender under legislation like HB and walk into a womens washroom and thered be the same issue. So it has nothing to do with transfriendly policies since this can happen without them.So the question is now that trans people are public knowledge how do we restrict washroom usage? Who gets to go where. What can we do to minimize risk and harm? Transfriendly laws and policies are an answer to that.,FemmeThoughtsFeminism,d2eed5j,4,t5_2uiyy
