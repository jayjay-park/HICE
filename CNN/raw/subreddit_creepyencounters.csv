4100670,0,t1_crmfsox,She was a white lady in her s. My mind went to scam too but it seems weird the way she singled us out. And almost causing a headon collision? Im not saying that that wasnt what was happening but it was still very creepy.ETA I thought about it a little more... After the initial pulling out in front of us and slowing down and slowing down when another car got behind her which could have resulted in her being rearended her actions could have caused accidents but not in a way that would make her look like a victim. I mean maybe she was hoping that in the case of a headon collision she would be collateral damage? Thats awfully risky. Then at the stop sign she would have hit us and it would have been clear that we were in the right. I dont know. I mean its possible that she was out for insurance money and just not smart enough to know the difference but it really felt off if you know what I mean.,creepyencounters,crnp9sa,1,t5_37xoh

4653375,0,t1_cqwj6hy,As a psychology major I would say if anything Chris has borderline personality disorder. I came to the conclusion because he was so emotionally manipulative to Brian which is usually present in someone with BPD. Someone with BPD is can be very clingy and assertive. It is common for them to threaten with self harm or outwards acts of violence in order to manipulate but it is uncommon for them to actually carry it out. ,creepyencounters,cth4976,0,t5_37xoh

4864773,0,t3_3dfnfe,I had something similar happen once. I was working at a radio station one night a few years back when this guy walked in our back door with a knife and said if I didnt call the police he was going to slit his wrists. I asked him to leave several times as he started to pour himself a cup of coffee while still holding the knife. Around this time the talk show host who was about to go on came out of the studio and started telling the guy hey Im about to go on the air you cant be here nothing worked. The guy wasnt threatening to us but he refused to leave and kept threatening to slash his wrists. We had like  minutes to airtime and there was no way I could start the show with this crazy knife wielding guy walking around the studio. So I came out of my booth with a wooden rod I found behind my desk and told him if he didnt get out I was going to beat him with it. He casually walked out and disappeared I flagged down a police officer I saw driving by and he supposedly drove off to look for the guy but we never heard anything again and we never left the back door to the studio open again!,creepyencounters,cu7qpvu,2,t5_37xoh

I think you should work on letting go of the experience it might lessen the anxiety a bit. Write about it talk about it and try to let your guard down a little at a time in safe situations ofc!

It was towards the end of the day and I dont know why anyone would leave all their field work gear for overnight up in that area.  Only latex gloves.
