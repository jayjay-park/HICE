11553994,0,t1_dg5lsnd,Its fine if you purchase your rubies real cash then thats no problem at all. But if youre a fp player then my answer is No. Trust me this is not advisable. Let say you would buy a hero with your rubies and would take you a month to get them to  assuming you spent all your rubies to himherit then you just wasted your time getting  hero maxed out. But let say you ought to use your k rubies in upgrading your  heroes to  in a week youve defeated higher orvel castlestockholdtower of challengeordeal and soldgrind more higher items during the month. ,Kings_Raid,dg5nddt,1,t5_3jui6
11564326,0,t1_dg6tjkm,in all honesty you already have a solid team where you could run frey jane selene and maria . If it was me id focus more on leveling them up or doing fragment runs and what not.,Kings_Raid,dg6tl2j,1,t5_3jui6
11577687,0,t3_658naz,it is all preference. A well built Assassin at high level can kill Mages and break tank easily. Mdmg has good burst and AOE but it is mana reliance.You can always build M.defdodgeBlock if the majority is M.dmg at your league. Also Uniques and Artifacts play a big part in making a hero strong. So play what you like there will be balance changes too.,Kings_Raid,dg8c567,1,t5_3jui6

11642282,0,t1_dgfge8e,Thanks NaSolid! I think I am going to stick to Jane first and once I clear everything  I will utilise Naila for PVP.No wonder Naila is in literally every party in challenger... in Asia..,Kings_Raid,dgfnzv4,1,t5_3jui6
11652942,0,t1_dggud6j,OK just gonna say few things about Reina of my own experience I have her  lvl with unique and all t  gears purplered. And shes not that much of a beast she usually the first to die and she does less dps than my Dimael wo his unique. I know that potentially she can be really REALLY good as Ive seen some crazy ones even tanking a high lvl raid. But these beasts we see are peoples who been playing since start or are whales. So as a beginner I would advice you to better have  frontliner and the rest in the back it will make things much easier for you especially as you run Frey. If I were you I would build MorrahClause Selene Lorraine and Frey for now. Just my opinion after playing few weeks.Edit If you choose the team I suggested build Reina or Fluss on the side as you might get stuck in ch on enemies with magic immunity.,Kings_Raid,dggvixn,2,t5_3jui6

11655508,0,t1_dgh4n68,gt | mil fragment bundle  Yes its totally worth it theres no reason not to get it unless you have too much rubies to reset upper dungeonloot scrolls. Gold and fragments are the biggest chokepoints until trascendence then its exp but at the begining earning xp comes naturally fragments dont at least not in the amounts that youll need.  im actually at the chokepoint as to gold and fragments are concerned. any tips for a faster way to generate gold aside from selling small exp pots and farming the vault? and which map got the highest yield of fragments? currently at chap and it gives out  fragments per run.gt |  star ticket  You wont be able to get the new archer with the ticket until a new batch of characters happen who knows when. i was actually pertaining to using the rubies ive saved up to get him. XDgt | Cleo or Maria  Cleo is enough mdps to clear pve from all the people I know that use her but her cc is very poor which Maria excells at Id personally swap her asap. with the new update dropping should i still swap out cleo? thoughts on the changes for both toons?and thank you so much for your response. ,Kings_Raid,dgh601a,1,t5_3jui6
11657730,0,t3_66bty9,Morrah already got buffed on previous patches and now she is getting buffed once again. She will probably take the knight cake at the moment. She fits the meta of magic damage her damage output is really high and her ccs are getting buffed ONCE again. She is already the easiest tank to solo red dragon now they are going to be a joke.,Kings_Raid,dghf2ca,-1,t5_3jui6

11688518,0,t1_dgksvi5,I dont really have anyone else to compare her with for pdps. I also invested in Reina but she seems to match my Maria in dps. Reina was also tanking everything until I got Naila out of the inn and I didnt even have Reinas unique until I after I got into chp .,Kings_Raid,dgkwtic,1,t5_3jui6
11690624,0,t1_dgku6vh,Actually have Reina crit is very easy. Her second skill gives  or ? not sure how the formula works of crit and she has  builtin crit as an assassin. Also both her first and third skill gives  crit when fully upgraded. Problem is she doesnt hit very hard even when she crits.,Kings_Raid,dgl5f0c,1,t5_3jui6
11731780,0,t3_67ek0x,It depends what your comp is. Jane boosts magic damage and almost never dies with her rd skill sustain and passive while Morrah raises magic defense has a bit more damage and more cc abilities. Its hard to say which is better without knowing what team theyre being used in though,Kings_Raid,dgptt0v,1,t5_3jui6
11748683,0,t1_dgrqkez,Hmmm you shouldnt be seeing much difficulty in chapter one though there is a bump in difficulty going from easy to normal. Make sure you are completing your missions to get the gear rewards they grant and look for an early chapter that drops armor for Kasel or weapons for DimRoi. If you can beat them on normal until you get blue gear then equip that you should have no trouble progressing might need to level up a couple of times as well.You dont always have to manage skills though no. Once you are properly geared and leveled you should be able to auto content without many problems you just have to be stronger than the content for it to work.,Kings_Raid,dgrqqp4,2,t5_3jui6
