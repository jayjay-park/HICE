637841,0,t1_cgce7bw,Thanks for the answer though it seems the answer is as simple as to unplug others I was just a bit confused because they never show a crew besides the Neb freeing anyone so I thought it might have just been a Morpheus thing ahha. Thanks again.,matrix,cgcruel,1,t5_2r30b
909973,0,t1_ch7lltw,I think you just answered your own question.gtgather the anomaly somewhere elseThere isnt anywhere else to gather the anomaly it must be pulled from the one. Only then can it be disseminated for analysis and patched accordingly. If you recall its a systemic anomaly that arises from algorithmic imbalance and manifests as the one and thats the only place it will exist. Its a security mechanism that was built in by the machines the architect more specifically and is a layer of protection against catastrophic failure.,matrix,ch7px58,3,t5_2r30b
917138,0,t3_24hgcn,The anomaly isnt just Neo its every human freed from the Matrix. That is the real danger. That Zion gets too big and that there becomes too many freed minds in the Matrix mucking things up. Just look at the damage Morpheus crew causes every time they jack in. You know thats a hell of a cover up on the Machines part to explain some of the shit bluepill see.The code is a way of control. They create this song and dance telling prophecies creating aversion to keep Zion and the freed minds focused on trying to win a war that isnt actually taking place and is long over. This keeps them predictable and easy to manage. So when they get too big they can just be put back down.In MxO there was some talk about how the system needed to be reset because it starts to become bug ridden as things go on. Look at Smith  presumably there may even be an issue of minds growing to reject.,matrix,ch8j96k,2,t5_2r30b

His power inside the matrix comes from his ability to understand and contravene the rules.  His power outside the matrix comes from his being connected to the machines via the biological interface program  ,matrix,cq7afn0,2,t5_2r30b

Judging by that  and not knowing a lot about geography much less geographical geography compared to political geography  Id guess that most capital cities and other major metropolitan cities fit the bill.,matrix,crqlr57,1,t5_2r30b

8468459,0,t3_4vnnw5,The negative response to the sequels from general audiences pretty much buried the franchise and Revolutions seemed to barely break even. But Im convinced well hear about a new movie or TV show in due time. Everything gets remade and rebooted eventually. The question is whether theyll want input from the Wachowskis on new material.I just hope its sooner than later. I need more Matrix in my life.,matrix,d603h8o,3,t5_2r30b

10456804,0,t3_5pgn77,Great post by the way!What is the equation of free will? The great architect of the universe must have wondered like for eternity. The machines can think just like humans. Imagine if they got the human free will If so they are no longer machines...And that is where it starts to get really creepy confusing thrilling beyond the imaginable...But What if one day the architect discovered the ultimate equation?...,matrix,dctdtc6,2,t5_2r30b
10719949,0,t3_5tai4u,When youre watching the Agent dodge bullets youre watching it happen in real time. When it begins showing Neo dodge the bullets youre watching it through bullet time and are seeing each individual movement. To Trinity he looks like hes moving just like them because shes still watching it all happen in real time. Shes sees him flail and lean back very quickly in real time. Im sure it looked very similar to the Agent. Thats how Ive always understood it. ,matrix,ddlom48,8,t5_2r30b

10896051,0,t3_5vpkig,The date has been retconned as of Reloaded and Revolutions in both of them it is said its  years that Zion exists.If Zionists believe that The Second Renaissance ended on  since the comic heavily implies its based on Zions archives of bits and pieces of information that Morpheus talked about and if Zionists also believe its close to  since thats what Morpheus said in the first movie that leaves considerably less than  years for the war in case its not included as a part of what they call The Second Renaissance  and why would it? the establishment of the Matrix the birth and exit of the first One and the foundation of Zion.      years where we should be looking at a figure gt . To be more specific and assuming the first One was at the very least in his s when he founded Zion then gt  years. Add even more years to accommodate for how long it took for the war and the Architect and Oracle to create the first cyclebased Matrix after the Architect experimented with the earlier two versions of the Matrix that werent working at all.The comics story was written before the first movie even came out and therefore its not surprising there can be some contradiction with the much latter released sequels when the Wachowskis had the chance to rethink everything and tell a coherent story across several media Sequels anime video games.Its story was also retold and completed in the anime version which features an omnipresent being who is sympathetic to both species Bless all forms of intelligence May there be mercy on man and machine for their sins suggesting it speaks directly to the audience rather than Zionists and therefore its speaking the truth rather than Zionists limited understanding of it.I would suggest you start with Morpheus statement that its  and that Zion exists for  years meaning they believe it was created around . Add  x  years cycles and the real world is around .,matrix,de3umgt,3,t5_2r30b
11273610,0,t3_6025du,Music to my ears!As long as the new films are not reboots or remakes....Im in for more Matrix universe stories on film! Its smart for WBs to get back into the Matrix business. Big time IP and Brand. Telling a Morpheus origin prequel style films is the way to go. Than perhaps toward the end of the st film or end of nd film....Neo returns!? Endless possibilities and stories to tell when it comes to the universe of The Matrix. Much like the Star Wars universe. Have the Wachowskis perhaps assist with storyproduce but have a different creative team write script Penn and hire other great talented directors. Imagine directors like Alfondo Cuaron Denis Villanueve Rick Famuyiwa George Miller Duncan Jones Neil Bloomkamp Jordan Peele Alex Garland Ridley Scott. Endless possibilities!,matrix,df9uigj,1,t5_2r30b
