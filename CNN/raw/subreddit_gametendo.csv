2179471,0,t3_2jye06,I never knew my dad.  my mom she threw me out of the house before I was even . Then she has the gall to try and keep in touch with me after that. Granted my life living with her was ty too. I had one friend growing up the only other kid in town. My entire childhood with him was spent getting the  kicked out of myself and then listening to him tell me how worthless I was. Not like I had a choice though there was only nine ing people in the town. I  you not. So I didnt miss the place but after leaving I spent my entire adolescence wandering the country from town to town.My only friend at the time was an Asian guy in his midthirties who only hung around with me since he thought Id get him laid. When I first met the guy we got in a huge brawl and he almost killed my pet a tiny rodent I carried with me. Only after I beat him did he want to have anything to do with me. There was a perk though this cute red headed girl that started hanging around. She was some kind of a sadist though she liked to beat me up and talk about water and . I think she was a little crazy but hey arent we all?Well some of us are a little loony but the bane of my ing existence was this loony as  adult couple. They where one of those kinds that dresses alike and finishes each others sentences. Then they had this crazy cat with them too the ing thing would not shut up. Let alone the ing thing always tried to like steal my pet rat and eat it. Damn thing needed a good boot to the face.I got to see a lot of crazy places which was nice but it was an episode after episode to get anywhere. So my life was ing weird I spent the time traveling from town to town getting in fights with kids and adults. The only thing that kept me going was my dream to become a pokeman master.,gametendo,clgv3pv,3,t5_31oey
