428697,0,t1_cforex6,TBH I didnt read this. But it perfectly illustrates the point I was trying to make.You are entirely too quick to jump straight into a defensive argument. I tried to give a little constructive criticism and you felt the need to prove my criticism wrong pointbypoint instead of just reading it and saying oh well I guess thats true. Not everything merits a response. Especially one so detailed that you clearly spent at least a few minutes on. Its a waste of time bro. Most people arent gonna read that shit.,MissouriPolitics,cfp773c,3,t5_30krb
844427,0,t1_ch08j0m,The argument for impeachment is that he violated Constitutional Amendment  passed in  that prohibited samesex marriages from being legally performed or recognized in Missouri. The Amendment passed via public referendum on August   with  of voters supporting and  opposing. Every county voted in favor of the amendment with only the independent city of St. Louis voting against it.The text of the adopted amendment which is found at Article I section  of the Missouri Constitution statesThat to be valid and recognized in this state a marriage shall exist only between a man and a woman.However on November   Nixon directed the state DOR to accept joint tax returns from samesex couples who were legally married in other states. This is as the Republicans in the House argue a recognition of marriage between two people of the same sex which is a direct violation of the constitutional amendment that was passed by an overwhelming majority of Missourians. The Governors Oath of Office statesI do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support the Constitution of the United States and of the state of Missouri and faithfully perform the duties of my office and that I will not knowingly receive directly or indirectly any money or other valuable thing for the performance or nonperformance of any act or duty pertaining to my office other than the compensation allowed by law.So he has apparently violated the Missouri Constitution and therefore his oath of office just on this issue of joint tax returns alone. So I would say there are definitely grounds for impeachment. Would I attempt it? No. Would I make a huge fuss over this single issue when we have so many other problems? No. But you cant really argue that they dont have standing.,MissouriPolitics,ch09jvh,0,t5_30krb

939767,0,t1_chb3em1,This isnt state funding excess. Its an economic development initiative. And its a plan for future excess. That doesnt mean we have excess now. But regardless the legislature has increased higher education funding by  million in the last  years even during the recession. Three weeks ago Nixon withheld over  million from the education budget Why? Because the legislature only gave him  million instead of  million. They ran the numbers and determined that the gap was only  million not  like Jay suggested.So dont put the blame for education shortfalls on the legislature. They allocated the money. Nixon withheld it.,MissouriPolitics,chb3vbk,0,t5_30krb

That question in November Question ? I think... would increase sales taxes and property taxes in that special tax district. So if that initiative and the statewide sales tax increase are approved then well have a double sales tax increase plus a property tax increase in some areas of Kansas City which are some of the poorest areas btw.gtThe statecity deal would help finance extensions of the streetcar line thats currently being built between the River Market and Union Station.

3709922,0,t1_cqf5eri,Yes. The political right has been pushing the trickle down myth of economic theory for  years now. It doesnt work but the opposite does. We have a consumerbased economy and if the minimum wage increases the consumer pool increases. Give someone with  million just sitting around earning interest an extra million they dont run out and buy  million in goods they throw it in an ETF with the other  mil. However give someone with  or  of disposable income an extra  a month nearly all of that is going right back into the economy.

Theres no state anything involved in athletic scholarships. The school if it wanted could hand them out to anyone it wanted whether on a team or not. Obviously theres an incentive for the schools to use the athletic scholarships for athletes actively on the team but theres nothing saying they have to other than wanting to keep the stream of donors who provide the funds for the scholarships happy. Theres also a big difference between stop playing for the team next year and if they refuse to participate for anything other than medical reasons they shall be stripped of their scholarship immediately.,MissouriPolitics,cy02smu,-1,t5_30krb
