The colors are not that brilliant in hz mode roughly like on my cheap benq but I use it mainly for gaming and browsing so its not a big deal for me. I adjusted them according to a recommendation in another thread for this monitor. The picture is viewable in a wide angle when you move around the monitor. If thats bad or good is up to you. In my opinion the monitor is worth its money if you are a fps player csgo overwatch. Now you can even see where youre shooting at while  no scopes! In games like skyrim or starcraft the increased refresh rate isnt really noticable so you might invest in a higher resoution if you dont play fps.,BaPCSalesEurope,db9l625,1,t5_395eo
