7888517,0,t3_4nbkpn,Hi Ive copy and pasted what someone else posted to the facebook group.  Not sure if there is more since I do not have the book yet. Obsessing staring is one of the most frustrating forms of OCD to have. It is not a rare manifestation but it is rarely written about by professionals. I dont have an answer as to why it is so hard to find anything written about it. The core symptom is a feeling that you are staring at the genitalsbreasts of other people. I have found that some sufferers dont actually do this but fear doing so. Other sufferers find that their eyes really do keep ending up focused upon the genitalsbreasts of others. As with all OCDs symptoms include every variation you can imagine. Some sufferers will only have this problem with the opposite sex for others it may be the same sex and for others it can be anyone.Getting caught blatantly andor repeatedly staring at the genitalsbreasts of another would be at the very least embarrassing and humiliating. This is usually the primary feared consequence for most sufferers and many sufferers who actually do stare have experienced their feared consequence. Sufferers may also have feared consequences concerning the meaning of their staring e.g. Am I a pervert?. For feared consequences about meaning the goal is still learning to live with uncertainty in this case never knowing what their symptom means. Sufferers of obsessive staring live in dread of public meetings with people. The interference in their lives may be as simple as constant anxiety and concerted efforts to always be looking down or in some way away from what they fear. Eye contact feels very risky since looking down is more likely to occur. In more severe cases the sufferer avoids going out and misses out on living. If this is one of your OCD problems you are probably wondering what exposure and response prevention would look like. If response prevention means not staring you feel you are constantly trying this without success. If youve been reading this book carefully you realize that response prevention doesnt mean avoiding behaviors that might lead to your feared consequence. On the other hand having you blatantly staring at genitalsbreasts in public will get you into trouble. We call the exposure solution used at my center for obsessive staring sneak peeks exposure . Behaviorally your goal is to try to surreptitiously sneak peeks without getting caught at whatever you are trying to avoid looking at. In this case uncertainty about getting caught still exists but you are actively trying to do something which is usually easier than trying to do nothing. The purpose of your Obsessive Staring Therapy Script is to help remind yourself why sneak peeking is your new goal rather than not having this problem I know I dont want to be caught staring at someones privates but Im going to have to risk it with sneak peeking. I dont know why the normal urge to do this is so strong with mepart of it probably comes from how scared I am of being caught and the pressure I put on myself to not do it. At this point in time it makes perfect sense that whenever Im in a problem situation I automatically respond with anxiety and urges. It would be wonderful if these just stopped but that is a fantasyIm going to have to shoot for second best sneak peeking rather than trying not to look at all. I still may be caught and embarrassed and if that happens Ill claim innocence and hope I get away with it.,StaringOCD,d42qqf0,3,t5_3et09
