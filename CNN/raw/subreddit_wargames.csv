1456579,0,t3_2atad7,Chain of Command for WW platoon combat with vehicles. Brilliant ruleset. Im putting together an American and German platoon at mm the scale used by FoW. I tried FoW but didnt like it very overcomplicated. Chain of Command similar to Bolt Action but more accurate and less gamey either would be good.,wargames,ciyuvj5,3,t5_2rcjh

2445949,0,t3_2nip6q, Well they are big... kidding couldnt resist. I tend to refer to the range or scale that the company calls them. WHK is mmHeroic  Infinity is mm and Wild West Exodus is mm. I also will talk about what they are comparable with. Not all miniatures of the same scale can mingle well. Some WHK Space Marines have issues with truescale mm even Infinity because of their bulkiness in size and weapons. They can be fudged but they dont always look right. Height by itself is useless without any type of reference. Even if I say it is mm it means nothing because what is mm... from the bottom of the feet to the eyes to the top of the head and what is the average size of a human. Since there are various troops for factions too are we talking a regular troop or some mechanized armor. Same as answer one. Even Im playing Eldar Im still referring to it being mmHeroic. I wouldnt say that I play using mm miniatures because it would confuse people even though the Eldar measure that. If I talked about its height are we talking Guardians Warp Spiders Wraithguards. It would be weird to refer to them to their height and not the scale that the company calls it. I tend to know which companies talk about measuring from the base of the foot to the top of the head or measures to the eyes. If Im talking about the scale I also will point out how they measure them because that can factor into it and help people determine comparability.   I believe it depends on the size of the miniature. Anything smaller than mm I would think would measure to the top of the head. It is easier to do once you start getting into mmmm range then talking about their eyes. Anything mm and above I would believe should be determined from the bottom of the feet to the eyes. It makes it easier to gauge sizes when using body armor heavy armor mecha helmets big hair etc.I usually only refer to the actual scale   when Im talking about vehicles. Although even then you can get  of the same tanks from different manufactures one using  and another  and the sizes be the same. So you have to rely on just what looks correct. I think it was on The Miniatures Page where they talked about taking the average height of a human then dividing the scale to determine compatibility. If we wanted to determine what  was compatable with it depended on how the company measured their miniatures. The magic number was . So you would take   . to determine that it should be compatible with roughly mm miniatures. The  number though comes from the average height of man from foot to eye mm . If the company measured to the top of the head it would be     . which means that if you are using mm the vehicles would seem bigger and may look off.,wargames,cme0v0e,2,t5_2rcjh

3048811,0,t3_2uyry4,The WotC Star Wars Miniatures game has been out of print now for a few years. There is still a fairly active community in the USA although small who still create official sets character cards but obviously no miniatures. Each card is a character with hit points an attack value defense value damage value and various special abilities. The interactions between abilities is what makes this game so complex. It has quite a steep learning curve but is very very worth it. However there are other ways of using the miniatures. I have a rule set called Flying Lead which is squad level shooting game that is very generic. You create characters but they are far less complicated than SWM. In fact I have a Star Wars conversion sheet that allows me to play out scenarios between my characters. Doing it this way is so much simpler than the official game even though that game is incredible.The figures are still available on ebay although Stormtroopers can be quite pricey. Obviously the most rare popular miniatures are also expensive Boba Fett figures can sell for up to . You can generally find someone on ebay who is selling off parts of their collection although it will probably be the less desirable miniatures.,wargames,coe0an2,1,t5_2rcjh

7386451,0,t1_d2hrxs8,mm infantry arent going to print well mostly. Arians designs are the exception to the rule. Ive found a space marine model that prints fairly well but youre better off buying already cast metal infantry since theyre only  a piece printing would be pennies a piece at most but the detail would be far lower.You can print infantry at mm pretty reliably.,wargames,d2hsep9,2,t5_2rcjh
7789578,0,t1_d0e4n2t,i think Warmaster Ancients is printrun only but could be wrong. I highly second the system.Hail Caesar is a more indepth ruleset covering all of classical antiquity. It is a very good system that can scale to different mini sizes though the books almost exclusively show mm armies.My new favorite is Dux Bellorum which handles Dark Ages Britain. It is fairly simple can be used with any size minis and has good ebb and flow features to the command amp control system.,wargames,d3rlsnz,1,t5_2rcjh

11691199,0,t3_65y8qs,You might want to look into Malifaux. It has one of the most unique rulesets Ive ever seen. Probably best to use a few proxy minis or tokens and play out some interactions in order to fully grok it. If youre looking for something more ontheme for semimodern combat I hear that Bolt Action has a great ruleset though Ive yet to try it myself.Finally for more outthere suggestions Id recommend checking out Guild Ball and Dystopian Wars. Both have some really great mechanics that fit really well with their respective themes.,wargames,dgl7rnt,1,t5_2rcjh
