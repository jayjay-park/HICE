5797649,0,t3_3uhmsr,We want to be a very eclectic sounding group which is why naming a genre is difficult. For example our influences that already reflect themselves in our currently written material are along the lines of Zappa Opeth Allman Bros King Crimson and even Miles Davis. Its also important to note that we are a very improv oriented duo that seeks others who can share in that musical conversation. So come join us on our intergalactic conquest!,NeedABand,cxfr4ng,2,t5_2vlkp
