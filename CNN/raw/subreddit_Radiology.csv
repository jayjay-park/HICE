308645,0,t3_1xmwic,People love to hate on the .mm rounds we use.  Common arguments are that they are underpowered lacking the mythical knockdown power the movies tell us that rifles should have.Let me be the first to tell you differently.The .mm NATO is one of the very best rifle rounds in the history of warfare when it comes to damaging the tissue into which its shot.  As compared to the .mm round which is slightly slower but much more massive there really is no comparison provided that both rounds are full metal jacket rounds  add a soft tip or hollow point to the . and youve got a completely different argument.The FMJ mm round punches a .mm hole in you.The FMJ .mm round fragments much more easily and those fragments wreak havoc on internal organs nerves and blood vessels.If ever given the choice between someone shooting you with an AK or an M pick the AK.,Radiology,cfcrbse,10,t5_2qpaw

Instead it makes the spoiler look like a blue link which prompts browser users to click instead of hover this leads to an error page.Edit Ok after some searching I found the issue and sorted it. The s syntax we were using appeared to be working when I did my initial test because my test comment contained the word spoiler in it. Apparently the s syntax only works for mobile users if that word is included. Since ours said FindingsDiagnosis it failed every time. s on the other hand accepts any text as a spoiler title and has now been modified through our stylesheet to keep the greyblack look we have going. Wiki and sticky have been modified accordingly.Edit Might consider modifying your recent submissions to the sub so they use this new s syntax. This way users can see recent examples of its use.

3800453,0,t3_33xojx,My situation closely mirrored yours. My Rad Tech degree was my th bday present to myself. I spent a year or so doing as many related courses at a junior college as I could to be certain this was the career for me. School was a blast but I had the luxury of not having to work at the same time and very minimal debt until student loans came due. It did take me almost a year after graduation to find a job  graduation. I worked per diem for a small clinic for several months then another part time with a mobile company. I currently work full time for a mobile company and it gives me many options. My work though is radically different from a hospital or clinical setting. Ill try and answer in order here. Crazy? No. Great Idea? maybe. I would say it ultimately depends on your willingness to increase debt put life on hold and gamble on a quick job.. Long term potential certainly and there is a huge variety of work that you can get yourself into in the entire imaging field.. Market is tough will likely be for quite some time.. Flexibility is key to get full time I moved from San Diego to Vegas. Being willing to relocate greatly increases your marketability.. No work for me all school.. I know the busyness varies dramatically based upon location. Clinically I had days where I would get ish patients depending on exams done and the next day I would do . Currently when Im not traveling to cover I tend to see between  people a day I do travel to all my patients at this point be it private home assisted living rehab etc.. I typically   hour days with one night of backup call and back up call on sunday. When I travel Im the clock  hours a week and on call constantly.. Financially Im pretty happy Id of course like more but Im in better shape then I ever was before and see the future getting better slowly.. Favorite things variety transferability science people. Least favorite people lazy coworkers getting called at am broken equipment.. I had a strong science and language background going into the program for the most part it was a breeze. I am also one of those people who doesnt have to study sorry. Hardest part I found was keeping certain positions and projections straight when presented with numerous similar choices. Also language for the California Fluoro test is so outdated and convoluted that it had me questioning whether or not I spoke English.I would highly recommend taking a medical terminology course and the highest level anatomy class you can get yourself into. The anatomy lab I took prior to program was much harder then anything I did in program and gave me a handy lead up. Also shadow several techs if you really get into the job before you do it.

4351058,0,t3_3aufq1,. Not quite. I is no pathology IIIV includes various degrees of mass effect mainly oedema yes BUT does also includes small bleeds and collections i.e. ltcm as well as parenchymal bleeds and lesions etc. VVI are for large lesions causing mass effect . The classification is very focused on how severe is the degree or risk of raised ICP rather than being a descriptor of the full extent of injuries.. No a small clot or haemorrhage i.e. ltcm would still allow IIIV.. That would be II You can have  midline shift BUT with the high density lesions making it category II. Read it as cisterns present WITH EITHER midline shift up to mm ANDOR lesions present BUT no highmixed density lesion gtcm.. Both intra and extraaxial bleeds. Its a classification to quantify mass effect and risk of raised ICP not specifically describing all the pathology  thats an important limit. Like all classifications its only useful for its specific purpose  in this case mainly to help identify and communicate clearly which patients may already or soon have significantly raised ICP and may need intervention. Its a risk stratification and communication tool for traumatic raised ICP NOT a comprehensive descriptor of all trauma severity.. With all CT reports reading the actual report is key. Classifications like the Marshall Classification or the Rotterdam Classification another risk stratification tool relating month mortality to CT features are useful aides to help communicate clearly specific risks were dealing with but they are all limited and focused tools. For example while a CT might be reported as Marshall Classification II the patient may still have a serious life threatening injury e.g. a severe skull base fracture which may still need urgent treatment. Basically when classifying any finding then the key is knowing the limits of the classification and if in doubt speak specifically to the report author to clarify the findings. And my general advice would also be if you want a scan classified its better to ask the report author to do that for you where possible  unless youre very experienced and confident in taking on that responsibility.,Radiology,csg3hls,2,t5_2qpaw

Yes you are right in the case of a STEMI the patient should go straight for percutaneous coronary intervention but MRI has emerged as the gold standard for assessment of global ventricular function and now in the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia as well. MRI in the diagnostic work up of ACS patients is not widespread as its utility is limited to specialised centres with appropriate equipment and staff. I believe it will be used in the triage of patients in future. I wont go into the detail but new advances in technology have significantly improved image acquisition speed.

The IT solution isnt always what is needed even if its a acceptable workaround.  Dictation system down?  Handing a tape recorder to the Dr. and sending the tapes to transcription isnt the solution.  Sitting the transcriptionist behind the Dr. so they can still turnaround STAT cases is.  Priors not coming over from the ER?  Send someone with a thumbdrive and have them load the DICOM files every  min on the PACS manually.  Even if the Drs tell you they can read without priors they cant.  Every report will say priors unavailable for compression.  IT solutions are for when everything is working and you are trying to make things work better.

If you want some cold truth its worth considering that all of us have a natural chance or  to  of getting cancer in our lifetime.  an extra  sort of gets lost in the noise of other things that could cause cancer or other things that could shorten your life like not being diagnosed with something early due to fear of having a scan.Another way to look at it is that in the USA the annual natural background radiation is .mSv whereas the world average is .mSv.source  So people on average in the USA get the equivalent of .mSv extra a year and your CT scan is only about what you get in extra radiation in two years of living in the USA.  Its not worth worrying about.Also re your comment about the lead apron we dont advise the use of lead aprons to shield bits of people in CT and in some circumstances that could be a really bad idea so dont feel like the technologists did anything wrong there.

For the most part the Dr places the plain film order we shoot it as long as its not way off pt complains of foot pain but cxr ordered then radiologist reads it and uses the drs notes on what to look for and offers advice on any additional imaging needed. I cant really add additional views but if I do see somthing like a fracture I will talk to the radiologist to add additional orders for imaging above and below the fracture because I know they will want it eventually. In CT amp MRI depending on where youre at I know some departments have radiologist that are more hands on and will want to protocol the orders before scanning.
