5360220,0,t1_cvwt47z,Currently the algorithm is    maxminshipTier scrap scrap.fSo generally you get upwards of  of their scrap. I think making this  would be more appropriate.. Currently youre right having scrap at endgame is a bad thing.. Ill definitely be modifying this ,WarInSpace,cvwtu7t,1,t5_396p6
5937584,0,t3_3dt3g2,ongoing multiplayer. we could have  GIANT highhealth motherships on a foreverserver that rewards  credits every time it is destroyed. scrap could be used to collect ingame boosts and ur tier upgrades would last forever.there could also be cargo ingame and in the foreverserver where if u bring it to the mothership you can sell it for a reward. however you can also have it stolen from you. it could be kind of like a battlestar galactica type of server. just a suggestion.,WarInSpace,cxxy4jx,1,t5_396p6
