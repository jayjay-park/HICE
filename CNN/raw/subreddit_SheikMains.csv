4675157,0,t3_3ez82t,U tilt is a great antiair IMO and is really useful once you learn how to perfect pivot into the u tilt. I like to use it at low percents after  ftilts then follow up with fair strings. Mapping your c stick to tilts is very useful for sheik for the same reasons. ,SheikMains,ctjuqz4,1,t5_38jyi

4724853,0,t1_ctq1xud,Thanks for the tips and for the pit thing it may be because I play a lot of fox vs him and Im not too consistent with multishineswavedash down shine so in the pit hell usually come out on top with falco vs my fox.,SheikMains,ctq3vsz,1,t5_38jyi
4728028,0,t3_3fofav,The biggest part of this mu is getting rid of Luma because Rosa just becomes combo food without a steady way of escaping pressure.Fair that Luma all over the place.   No really get rid of Luma with fair.  Nairs lingering hitbox is also good if the Rosa is recovering since youre pretty guaranteed to hit both of them.   Bouncing fish also a bit safer to throw out in this mu because if you miss Luma youll just hit Rosa unless you undershoot the distance.   As with anything though dont overuse that option because you could eat an usmash on a read. With Luma gone do your Sheik stuff.  GG. This mu isnt really that one sided  good Rosas should actually space and pressure and not lose Luma.   But once they do thats a big punish. ,SheikMains,ctqibaf,2,t5_38jyi
4738501,0,t1_ctrq39w,gt Well using needles while falling just above your opponent is a great way to get grabs.fully charged needles are pretty important to have when doing this btw. I mean you can do it uncharged but you obviously have to be really close to do it and generally youll just get stuffed or otherwise outmanuvered.,SheikMains,ctrtygt,2,t5_38jyi

4844266,0,t3_3h81ht,It just comes with practice. Best way to learn to shffl is to start by short hopping in place til you can do it consistently then do running short hops then start incorporating a fast fall at the peak of your short hops then just add in the l cancel. Go through each step til you can do it  of the time then move onto the next.As for shielding when you l cancel you may be auto canceling if its something like fair but really you just need to work on pressing and releasing the trigger really fast. I use R to l cancel but I took the spring out of my l trigger to make power shielding easier and some people say they find it easier to l cancel without a spring so you may want to look into that if its a real problem.,SheikMains,cu55mt8,2,t5_38jyi
5284102,0,t3_3mz5ql,By far one of my favorite matchups. Some people here say that it is Sheik favored but that is really only true once she lands a grab.,SheikMains,cvn3swq,1,t5_38jyi
