3701438,0,t3_32n6qk,EDIT With the appearance on twitter of a newly name changed account The Liberty Lions  and the announcement of Liberty Lions by Kovan Direj  I have decided to remove these posts for now until I get more information. This is separate from and not the official YPGJ group Lions of Rojava. The claims about Lions of Rojava being defunct arent true from the recent tweetspictures Ive seen.  ,rojava,cqe6sr1,3,t5_358x7

6378923,0,t1_czbtpl2,RojavaPlans website lists that theres effectively a mandatory intensive language course for foreigners which should provide those coming with a basis in the language. I read it also as providing a cultural immersion sort of program.Previously RojavaPlan has suggested that there are between  and  foreign volunteers without any Kurdish background working on infrastructure  I would want to confirm this though because I hope they arent mixing YPG and civil society volunteers. Noncombatant foreigners should not will not? I dont know be placed anywhere near the front lines of the conflict if they didnt need to be and surely you would have more sense than to go there if you didnt have a reason.Id leave it to uRojavaPlan to give you an actual answer but they seem quite busy so Im regurgitating things theyve said.,rojava,czepqpi,1,t5_358x7
6510898,0,t1_czsnzj8,I just watched a CNN clip a bit ago were Syrian Kurds were talking about Russian airplanes and the bombs they were dropping on them. In the same clip they were showing damage ISIS had done to some buildings. I think the clip was shot in Aleppo but Im not sure sometimes articles can get a little ambiguous and hard to follow. ,rojava,czsrzc3,1,t5_358x7

7235257,0,t3_4eizb0,Im dont think the YPS openly accepts Western volunteers because they are under the PKK umbrella which is considered a terrorist organization by most NATOEU countries. Theyre primarily operating in Northern Kurdistan Turkey so it would not be anything legally speaking like volunteering with the YPGJ or Rojava Plan. ,rojava,d20lh0t,3,t5_358x7

7264935,0,t3_4efz7f,I lived in kurdistan for  years if u fly into erbil you will be questioned for sure. Probably b you go by staff asking why you are going. I used  just show them my residency card and work invite. Goin  sulay you will be fine. But its miles from the border. If you just hang out in sulay there are other westerners there doing diff types of work and some will prob be waiting like you are for the border  open. It may take a few days before you see anyone. Plus if you wait and the border doesnt open for ages and you decide  leave you may well be fined for overstaying your visa. Personally i would wait a bit longer.,rojava,d23yzuv,1,t5_358x7

8203307,0,t1_d52xcpl,Its a good point i dont have an answer to. I assumed it to be difficult because of the historicly geopgraphical and localiced approach and the need for additional mediation layers as this makes a different kind of mediation necessary for rural areas.

9941521,0,t1_davmoow,I did read somewhere that it was their intention to help establish democratic confederalist administration of the city.edit Because otherwise I mean... there would be a complete power vacuum. How can the regime control Raqqa from Damascus with all that space in between the two points and no monopoly of force since the SAA is in the west? The author is probably guessing who knows.,rojava,db3ekv5,1,t5_358x7
10128392,0,t1_dbq3v6l,Im still reading Murray Bookchin and about Anarchism in general and I havent read a lot of Ocalan but the main point seems to be that before patriarchy began to develop the sexes saw each other as equal and society was pretty democratic since people had equal power. Then for a variety of reasons the men who were usually the hunters began to gain power by accumulating wealth causing a rift between the sexes and later a class system developed. But like I said Im still reading about all of this. You should ask this question in rcommunalists or ranarchy,rojava,dbrqhav,1,t5_358x7

11804542,0,t1_dgy17ra,To put it in brief the question is what corroboration is satisfactory? And what oversight can we expect? Even mainstream press is capable of the same deception and bamboozling you describe. All we can have is a spectrum of confidence not certainty.Without a doubt resources like this ought to be subject to a great deal of suspicion. But nothing of course is free of that.We have to modify our expectations given certain circumstances or postpone judgement since it will be hard to prove what you want. Or hard to show that any proof isnt itself also faked.Epistemologically we are in a bind and theres no easy answer. We need to invite both attention and scrutiny.,rojava,dgy33hq,1,t5_358x7
