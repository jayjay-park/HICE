278538,0,t1_cf9mfqn,You know you never get to respond to student comments.  And sometimes Id like to do that.  Dr. Archaeopteryx gave us too much information for a freshman class.  He expected too much out of us.  It was impossible to do.  Right.  Although the girl sitting next to you managed to get through the class with a  average.  Too much talk about breasts.  The class is called Mammalogy.He mentioned beer in class.  Im a Christian and shouldnt have to listen to that sort of thing.  The name of the lab exercise was Fermentation.  What did you think I should talk about?There was a girl who was disruptive and asked odd questions and he didnt do anything about it.  The girl was autistic and made an A in my class.  Perhaps you should be more openminded.I dont think he should belittle creationism.  Its peoples beliefs.  Sometimes people have stupid beliefs.  ,TheNewGeezers,cf9mssk,1,t5_2ylca

This is the sort of thing that sticks. For MIL a year moving forward the owners are buying a PR liability. As you said they can get damned near anybody to do that job for a lot less money and a lot less headache. Yeah Jerry Jones. Is this guy a piece of work or what? I admit to being skeptical of  year old events suddenly becoming allegations and Florio is probably right about the thing being tossed or more likely settled by Jones.However Jones will undoubtedly face a tough punishment from the NFL if the allegations are founded. But there are far more questions than answers at this point.Uh huh. Right. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Tough punishment from the NFL. Just like Jim Irsay.  game suspension.  road games he wasnt going to attend and  home games he has to watch from home. Ouch!!,TheNewGeezers,ckfebao,1,t5_2ylca

5541956,0,t1_cwk10za,Well Rauners solution is no solution to that or anything else.I should add that the things the state does that are necessary do have to be funded and the Supreme Court is not going to let Rauner evade the pension payments.  Theres no way he can cut his way to a balanced budget.  He really does have to come to the admission that it isnt just the Democrats that need the income tax increase he does too.  Theres no reason for them to give him union gutting in exchange for something he already needs.  The whole thing has become a stupid ego trip.,TheNewGeezers,cwk14l2,1,t5_2ylca
