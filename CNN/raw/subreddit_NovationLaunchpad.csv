6182553,0,t3_407u42,Covers is a really big concept so I recommend being more specific.But I think you meant that you want to do covers of songs playing the drums separately from the synths and voices and put the individual sounds on a drum rack then play them on your LP right?And you want to know how to recreate the sounds you desire is that so?If it is then of course this is possible but to make for example a drum layout kick clap snare and hat sound exactly like another song ones you have to search for sample that get near to the song ones.For the actual sounds you need to learn synthesis which is how to create specific sounds.Then you have to search or leak by ear the succession of notes melodies chords etc. Then you identify the song parts intro development build up drop outro etc.Then you build the song in a drum rack and arrange it in a comfortable way for you and start practicing.I know no other way to do what i guess you want and there are tutorials just search for how to make launchpad covers on youtube and... Well you know.Good luck and feel free to ask anything in a Private Message.,NovationLaunchpad,cyse4cw,2,t5_2zbpd
