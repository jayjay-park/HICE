3870733,0,t3_34dgcv,It wont carry the Wii name for  possible reasons Nintendo finally realized that it needs to be a something new or because its not even going to be a home console,NintendoNX,cqxhx1g,2,t5_37fk0
4505890,0,t3_3csqlr,I agree .  Nintendo announced the NX only to counter the argument that they are Leaving the console business.  People were worried they were going to start making mobile games exclusively or something.  Their announcement only reinforced the fragility of the WiiU.  If only they advertised the WiiU better over the past  years things would be different.  Why would anyone buy a WiiU now when a new better console is just over the horizon?  After Splatoon the only notable game coming out on the WiiU is Xenoblade Chronicles X and possibly Star Fox.  The NX announcement confirmed that the WiiU is basically done.  They placed a roadblock in front of all future WiiU sales.  If the NX is badass and actually competes with XB and PS I will buy it.  I wont buy it if it has GB of internal storage.,NintendoNX,csym92u,1,t5_37fk0

4799579,0,t3_3glf5j,Whew. I am bored and I have been doing some thinking so I thought I would write a quick post on what I think the NX will be and Nintendos plans for the future. This is all extremely speculative but why not? This is the kind of nonsense fanboys crave.As long as you have evidence. And it isnt a fanboy thing where did you get that? I see people who hate Nintendo to literal death speculate about the NX.First the NX is a set top box. It will sit right next to the TV and it will be about as powerful as a PS. Maybe a little more maybe even a little less. But it will be able to run all the games a PS or XBOne can run.I very much agree. If Dragon Quest   Final Fantasy  and possibly Metroid Prime  can run on it no way is it not going to be on par. Besides we are halfway through a gen making PSs hardware withered anyway.I believe Nintendo has come up with a really clever controller idea The NXs controller will be essentially a Gamecube controller cut in half. The controller will be modified so that they could be used with Wii and WiiU games allowing for either Digital backwardscompatibility or full WiiU backwards compatibility with the system. There will be motion controls speakers and even an infrared port everything required to play any game Nintendo has ever made. You can play NX games comfortably on the controller with your hands separated by a fairly long distance. But here is the gimmick The controller will allow for a user to mount their cell phone between the controllers and connect the three separate pieces into a single controller. Thus Nintendo finds a cheap way to solve the WiiU emulation problem finds a viable use for mobile and adds the most important aspect of all being able to play NX games remotely by linking to the console over a WiFi connection.There is actually in a way an issue with this idea. Miyamoto was the  one whom pushed for the Wii Mote and Wii U Gamepad and even heavily was involved in their design but now he was removed from this team which wouldnt make sense if the controller had a gimmick supporting the Gamecube design you mentioned. I do think the Gamepad will be compatible along with Wii Mote and Gamecube Controllers.I believe Nintendo will begin a paidinternet subscription service like PS or Xbox Live. I think it will be clunky at first but it will begin to streamline and offer some unique features. Game discounts free NESSNES games and who knows maybe Nintendo even takes it further. I also think that it will be this service that replaces the popular Club Nintendo. In fact based on recent rumors about subscription boxes from Nintendo I suspect that a premium version of this service will include physical monthly rewards potentially including a monthly amiibo or something similar.No. After I read paid internet no. This is completely not something Nintendo would ever do. Especially not now when they want to unite gamers not separate them further.,NintendoNX,ctziycc,1,t5_37fk0

5734888,0,t1_cx7rswx,gtGame DevelopmentSince the NXs power and architecture would be similar to the Wii U the transition of game development from the Wii U should go smoothly.  Games that began on Wii U will be able to move over to NX with ease and development tools will be familiar for new games.  The NX GO will introduce the console market to third party developers and franchises usually seen on the DS. To get an idea of what a release schedule would look like combine both DS amp Wii Us line up from the past couple of years.  All of the games available on one platform and the possibility of being a home console a handheld or both.  Just like on the DS amp Wii U since the hardware is unique most games would probably end up being exclusive to the platform.  Its assumed development for NX would also be cheaper than the PSXB and it would allow publishersdevelopers to sell  gamelicense over  devices NX amp NX GO.  The idea is to be lowrisk and profitable.  The third party support would be different than the Playstation  XBOne and PC but still be able to create a serviceable lineup similar to the DS.,NintendoNX,cx7ywaq,0,t5_37fk0

6028397,0,t1_cy9g8dw,Exactly. Nintendo is not going to rush the NX out with ports of old games. Smash  will probably be the NXs holiday  title.

6054984,0,t3_3ye7n0,Irrelevant in America anyway.. A tiny percentage of the population will own a K TV in the next  years.. That tiny population is shrunk further to the few who dont have a monthly data cap. GBmonth gets eaten fast with K. Data caps as a trend are growing not going away. Comcast plans to redeploy caps in all of its markets. My own ISPs CEO bragged that data cap overage fees are now a significant revenue source. The ISPs who dont have caps will be emboldened to try them. Google Fibers fastspeed and nodatacap plan is competition in only a few markets.. Someone who owns a K TV and secures a data plan to stream regularly at K surely can afford a dedicated streaming box instead of relying on the limited and delayed app and channel offerings of a PS Xbox or NX console. Not to mention every K TV is likely a smart TV with its own streaming apps built in.If you love streamed video youre probably already not relying on a game console to provide it. The gamer who is an occasional Netflix watcher isnt going to choose  a console based on K streaming instead of the quality of the games offered on the console. I dont see it happening.

Are they right? Who knows. Only time will tell. Also games that are on multiple platforms perform better. Period. If you look at the top selling games they are always released on multiple platforms. I wont pretend to know the details of Sonys deal but I know rise of the tomb raider was a console exclusive for a year but also came to PC. Fire watch is a PS exclusive but is also on PC. quantum break and Alan wake are the same. Sony is in direct competition with Xbox right now no matter what the specs of NX are probably wont be competing with Nintnedo. I just dont understand why splitting a user base between consoles is a big deal. I would call it expanding the audience.

Anything is possible right?I feel trolled. Let me level with you. I didnt try and focus on the technical difficulty because Im not the best qualified to do so so I focused just on the costbenefit. Im still not the best qualified and you can google your own research. They are two different things. Combining them would be a massive undertaking if not impossible.

6946791,0,t3_4ajts7,The library at the end of my block is changing my purchasing habits. Back in the day when we got a new console we always rented titles prior to purchase. There were also demos in playstation magazine and pc gamer. Over the past few generations we got away from that but recently we ran out of toner and I ran to the library to print out some tax documents. They have a shelf there I knew of that has ps  Wii and ds games. I noticed a file next to the cabinet and printer. Its tabs were labeled ps xbone and Wii u. When I flipped through the contents each system had their catalogue including games released  weeks ago. I asked the librarian and they said they plan on purchasing all AAA titles for all  systems as close as possible. One title I noticed they purchased  copies of. They allow you to put holds on titles you want and the longest one I came across is I will wait  weeks for a copy of the new tomb raider which is fine because we are going to have plenty of titles to play.

6952891,0,t3_4ax66l,I have to say there is almost a less than zero percent chance this is the next console or likely even real. Aside from the ridiculousness of it there are a couple practical reasons this would not be nintendos new console. First the haptic buttons. Nintendo has always prided itself on producing sturdy and lasting hardware. There is no way a membrane covering the entire screen which is flexible enough to change shape for haptic buttons wouldnt wear out fairly quickly with any real use. There is no way the front office would allow a console to be shipped which would pose such a PR risk when the membranes wear through and you have to either buy another very expensive controller a whole new console or send it in for repair.  Secondly unique or not there is no way they would put the physical controls in the middle of the screen like that. Once again for practical reasons. You lose much of the viewing area to controls and hands developing and manufacturing a screen that has holes in the middle of it for joysticks would be prohibitively expensive and there is no real reason to ship a console with an expensive proprietary screen that only adds massively to the cost of your console and will be covered up and almost entirely unused then hands are gripping the controller.Thirdly the ergonomics would be awful unless they changed the shape. Tying the ergonomics into the haptic buttons having no dedicated buttons means you are leaving the control of your games entirely up to the game developers. The potential for many games to be shipped with haptic buttons appearing in uncomfortable and difficult to reach areas would also be a nightmare for the Nintendo front office. Im sure nintendo has some cool new ideas but it still all comes down to what can the engineering team put together what practical use would it serve what liability would it pose what parts and skilled labor can manufacturing reasonably acquire and at what cost could all of that be delivered to the market. If any of those things is off then it is very unlikely that a major product like a flagship console will be produced. ,NintendoNX,d14fxor,11,t5_37fk0

You place something directly in front of that camera that acts as a stencil. The stencil would be an exact replica of the shape of the free form screen but inverted. This way it covers the corners of an oval shape or in the middle where a hole or analog stick would be. When the scene renders you just get black in those spots. The rendering knows what and what not to render.As Ive told the other girl arguing along with you already  your convenient amateur desktop rendering software  realtime graphics processing gt My point is that you can cut it out in the camera before rendering.Thats your unsubstantiated claim yes. thumbsup gt While this isnt used nothing needs it right now it isnt impossible.LOLWhat a pathetically sh!tty argument. Yeah. Its possible. You know whats also possible?  Nintendo could build a system that doesnt use binary   but operates on ten digits ! It is possible. Is it FEASIBLE though? YES!

7209562,0,t1_d1wl466,Okay first of all if this is from March  its obviously a conceptual render. So to say it looks ugly or unNintendo doesnt necessarily mean anything. Also lest you forget multiple rumors and leaks have spoken about looking like a cross between Nintendo and Samsung. Does this not look like that? Im not saying its real or fake but any complaint about how it looks has no real basis. Aside from that screw you this thing looks beautiful. lmaoAlso where do you get the no way to watch them back from? Every system has a UI and a video player. Im sure if this were real it would have a way to watch them back and honestly I dont see where you even got the idea it couldnt?Also on the subject of the hardware capabilities and battery life technology is advancing all the time. Every single week theres some sort of breakthrough somewhere big or small it happens. Again Im not saying this is real or fake but to say its impossible is just wrong. Theres a very good possibility that Nintendo or whoevers hardware components theyll be using have made less battery intensive parts. Or heres a Nintendo solution battery packs! If the device itself had a three hour charge and a battery pack to hold another three hour charge that came with it thats six hours of gameplay! And really thats all you need before youre in reach of a charger where you could potentially charge the system and battery pack at the same time? Again agreed this most likely isnt real as much as Id like it to be but what the hell is the point of being in this sub if youre not going to keep an open mind and just enjoy the different ideas and possibilities until the NX is officially presented to us?

Most games also allow the use of the Wii U Pro controller.I really dont think the Wii U is gimmicky at all and I certainly dont think that the controller is the reason its struggled. The issues with it have been far more due to the marketing name included difficulty in porting to both due to power and architecture and consequent lack of enough releases all part of a negative feedback loop really.The DS is unambiguously the more gimmicky system.

7233472,0,t3_4e87za,Since the NXs surrounding nature so far is more indicative of a radical shift rather than just a successive installment I would be surprised if they kept the Wii branding.  However I believe the name will be something identical as far as overall etymology goes. A torch that Nintendo definitely holds over Sony and Microsoft is their emphasis on innovative local multiplayer games and more abstractly social interaction and community. I think those concepts definitely become apparent when you consider how Nintendo has modestly been slowly amplifying the social features in their platforms Pokemon on the DS being the most notable Pokemon Go Mii Plaza Miimoto etc. This is one of the reasons I continue to root for Nintendo.,NintendoNX,d20e5p5,1,t5_37fk0

7630903,0,t1_d39fux7,Sony and Microsoft alike are going to have decide which way they want it. Either theyll allow the PS NeoXbox . to segment the userbase or they wont. Indeed upgraders may want more performance out of their new highend toys but it wont matter much to Sony and Microsoft unless theyre in danger of losing their cut of those upgraders entertainment dollars.  Most of the time theyll follow the money and that will mean protecting both revenue streams  unless they believe that satisfying upgraders at the expense of nonupgraders will generate more cash than maintaining compatibility for all.  And whichever way they decide to go you can bet theyll set a similar policy for third parties to follow.So it goes with Nintendo.  If theyre not following the money then theyre pursuing a passion project that just isnt realizable on the original DS.  Otherwise it becomes a bridge title like Hyrule Warriors.  If Nintendos number one objective was to get people to upgrade to the New DS they wouldnt have released an Amiibo reader for the original DS but they did because they knew theyd be leaving fat stacks of Amiibo money on the table by not doing so.  And they also wouldnt release mostly bridge titles.In any case weve veered plenty far enough off topic here.  If Nintendo falls behind on account of Sony and Microsoft moving the goalposts so to speak they should be ready for it and so should their customers.

After a short period my walls are gone and I can see enemy aircraft in the vast sky beyond where my walls previously were. Perhaps my immediate surroundings are unaffected but whether you call this AR or AV augmented virtuality makes no difference to me. Who the hell wouldnt want to experience that game?

Considering that they apparently already put a lot of work into VC making sure the emulation runs Just So putting that work into a port instead doesnt seem too unlikely. Stranger things have happened  remember that they ported a bunch of GCN games to Wii with completely revamped control schemes.Personally Id rather see a best of Mario Party compilation instead of releasing individual games one at a time or worse only releasing Mario Party  again.,NintendoNX,d3bjxyx,1,t5_37fk0

7699597,0,t1_d3hd5r1,Those are fair points. The issue with tailored products is the install base. Most games would target the minimum specs of different hardware in order to maximize their install base. If the hardware varied much more than the New DS vs the DS vs DS XL I think it would end up with a GenesisxCD type deal where your better hardware would only have a handful of games that actually use it. I dont think it would be economical to support multiple hardware specs on the budgets games have. Every platform increases art and QA costs dramatically. Maybe if Nintendo made a very robust dev kit it could make this kind of a moot point?The margins on phones are insane. The iphone  only costs  or so per unit. Nintendo is in a very different business and aims for slimmer margins. Nintendo usually cuts corners esp on screens although I kind of hope they stop that trend.  I carry a large external battery for my phone. The whole gaming experience on my phone is just really crappy for me overall. It gets hot the charging cable coming out the side where my hand is. I like buttons  It is just an awful experience to play anything that I have found so far  except maybe downwell or super hexagon but they are both still very shallow games IMO.

7740401,0,t1_d3lz6fj,Thats the part I think many people arent acknowledging. NX will have far more value in its first Holiday season this way. If a console launches right before Black Friday it will sell well based solely on it being new see Wii U but a console that has  months to build a lineup could potentially sell even better if its good. Lots of kids will have one or two friends who already have one and talk about it maybe they even played it at their house. Those kids are going to ask for it for the holiday season. Its far enough out from launch that Nintendo can do holiday bundles or discounts a la Xbox which will entice parents.

GBA gt Gamecube DS gt Wii DS gtgt NX.However something I noticed about the DS is that most of its titles arent really onthego kind of games but pretty fullfledged console games Fire Emblem Monster Hunter Super Smash Bros. SMT etc. Id love to see these games on a normal TV screen. Thats why I love the hybrid theory. The cartridge usage give me even more hope. I hope that the NX would be two different consoles a handheld and a normal home console both share the same cartridges save are stored on cartridges anw right? and I have had this vision ever since MHU.This though this isnt really what I wanted. Not only does it sound like a subpar console it also seems like an extremely uncomfortable handheld experience.,NintendoNX,d5rmtio,1,t5_37fk0

Maybe on paper Nvidias going to tell you that their Pascal Tegra chip is going to be powerful probably without taking into account real world problems like battery life and heat. Modern smartphones are very powerful but theyre only meant to work for a short period of time at a high speed. When people benchmark mobile processors with something very intensive they get very hot and start clocking themselves down to compensate. Not to mention since Nintendo is going to want to make this is mobile system they need to be aware of battery life.

9042678,0,t3_5446sk,My thoughtsThe device most certainly will be a hybrid and I think it will be a smart move for Nintendo. A lot of people like to play games on the go and the living room TVs for families are a contested thing. Some people dont even own a TV anymore as there are so many other devices to watch media content on. Nintendo took steps with the Wii U as you could still play on the pad while someone else was using the TV so a hybrid is a natural step forward and covers all the possible scenarios for users.I personally think there are two scenarios for the NX hybrid. One is that it is as powerful of a handheld device as possible that you can put in a dock to play on your TV. It will be cappeddown clocked on the go and then run full throttle while connected to the power grid.Second scenario is that the device has less beefy GPU but the dock has an external GPU for the device so it handles p with ease on TV. This also opens up for easier upgrades down the line as only the dock could be upgraded if needed be and thus prolongs the life of the main device itself. A bit like switching graphics card in a computer while keeping the rest of your system intact.Or a combination of both giving three potential buy options for customersGo NX device only .Basic NX device with standard dock and controller .Premium NX device with premium dock and controller .Thoughts?,NintendoNX,d7ysa38,12,t5_37fk0
9042728,0,t3_543je1,The NX is starting to feel like a myth.Like we all mass hallucinated that Nintendo said the NX is a thing that exists.

Nintendo has no idea what this NX is that Nintendo fans keep talking about.I may be becoming slightly mentally unwell from all these months with no NX announcement.

9045107,0,t1_d7z2d5l,Lets use an analogy here.Lets say were a subreddit all about Taco BellrTacoBell. We love us some shitty mexican food. Theres a new special item coming out and were in full hype mode. Its the Quesalupa! We have a verified source at the manufacturing plant that says theyre making the shells. The guy making the shells doesnt know when theyll start selling them if its select locations or nationwide if theyll have advertisements on TV or how much theyll charge for them. How could he possibly know that information? Hes not in a position to know. Hes just the guy making shells. All he knows is that shells are being made and they have a shelf life of a few months so he can only guesstimate when theyll be in stores.Edit Also while my track record here is pretty non existent because the NX hasnt been revealed yet my track record over on ramiibo is .

A MotherEarthbound game probably a D one who knows that would surely make a lot of people go crazy me included. I mean they Nintendo themselves wouldnt joke about it on one of the previous E and then leave Mother fans insulted right? it has to happen at some point or at least it should happen and it WOULD sell for sure. That franchise not only holds a place in our hearts but also has the potential of bringing new people into the series which is something great that not every game in this life does.,NintendoNX,d80a1sh,2,t5_37fk0

9058541,0,t1_d80ff9f,I dont know if there is a direct quote like you are seeking but I think the reason people believe BotW will be there at launch is for the very simple reason that they would be HIGHLY undermining NX sales if they release BotW on Wii U even one day before the NX.Zelda is a major system seller. Just ask anyone who bought a launch day Wii. Im willing to risk a guess and say that not many people picked up Call of Duty over Zelda. If Breath of the Wild launches on Wii U first it will sell consoles like hotcakes. Those potential buyers will then sit back enjoy some other superaffordablebynow Wii U titles that they wanted to pick up but were never enough to get them to buy a Wii U and then continue to ignore the more expensive NX with its higher priced games and system. This will lead to less NX sales which leads to less third party support which leads to even fewer sales of the system until the NX slowly dwindles into nothingness. Unless they have some other mind blowing title that none of us have known about that is so vast and bound for success hitting exclusively the NX in the first year or so that ISNT Breath of the Wild. . . I cant see Nintendo risking that. I honestly dont think Nintendo has another game like that that could possibly be in the same level as BotW. They couldnt have another completely secret game with enough content and confidence in it that they could dedicate a whole E length spectacle to it. They dedicated E to just generating Breath of the Wild buzz. It worked. Now they need to get people excited to buy the NX to play the best version of it. They really need to give the NX every chance it can. If Breath of the Wild is going to release on both systems on the same day then the NX releasing that day makes the most sense. They are going to build up hype for some NX exclusive features along with the very compareable to the Wii U price point and hope more people grab an NX with a copy in one go. Could the NX launch before BotW? Sure but why? They really need the launch of this system to do well. Not the month of launch. They need to be able to point at the sales figures from the first weekend and say We sold X number of BotW games and Z percentage of those sales were with a sale of our next hardware platform.They want third parties to turn their heads and be drooling at the install base from day one. They cannot afford third parties or the general public any moment to think that the NX is anything other than bound for success and a new Zelda game something we havent seen for the entirety of the Wii U life cycle has the highest chance of doing that. Ports of Wii U titles with new content and party type gimmick games like Wii Sports and Nintendo Land can pad the launch but they cant be the only things out there on the release date or they are going to have a flood of press dissing them into a corner.  EDIT After some digging it appears that people are getting that simultaneous quote directly from Nintendo themselves. Go ahead and look at the second to last question.  He does in fact say same day when talking about the Wii U and NX versions of BotW releasing. If an interview isnt enough then Nintendo of Europe has an article with translated information from the Japanese office financial meeting and they do say Simultaneous there.,NintendoNX,d80owc3,1,t5_37fk0

9067581,0,t1_d81kyqr,Ok you won! Thats like the best solution for detachable controllers something I am a bit sceptic about as a whole. It have been thinking about regular cordless controllers and a portable device that just lets you keep playing when you rip it out from the dock. I agree on foldable and if Ninty really need the controller to be detachable I cant see why its necessary though this could be the way to go.edit so what if the clamshell in folded closed mode connects to the base unit via slot in. You push it in on the front side of the base unit it goes click and the base unit almost swallows it completely. Push it again and it releases. Think NES without the hatch an pushdown operation. The game cart goes in the side of the portable unit. The cart is visible and removable while the portable sits inside the base unit. When looking at the NX it really looks like a traditional home console with a base unit and two controllers but the good stuff is hidden inside. You release the portable clamshell and you can pick up playing where you left just seconds ago now charged.,NintendoNX,d81ryq6,10,t5_37fk0

Was the Pokemon Go event or Breath of the Wild?It was Breath of the Wild whats your point exactly? I doubt Nintendo is under any pressure to change their NX strategy towards Go or responding to what pressure there may be. Firstly because if they folded so easily to the pressure of popularity booms and market trends theyd have been making mobile titles years ago. Secondly because like I say given everything theyve said their strategy has been to use successful mobile titles to drive the NX business from the beginning.

It might look muddled but they could make it look a bit more userfriendly.Ive always loved the feel of the gamecube controller and I also dug the way the wiimote felt in my right hand and the nunchuk in my left hand. This would explain the detachable controllers thing because instead of being used for two different people it just means theyre wireless and you can hold one in each hand. The S buttons are Start and Share the LS and RS stand for Left and Right Scroll and the Z buttons are the triggers. I imagine these feeling a bit like PS triggers. The detached dpad thing to me could work as a dpad but also as extra buttons if a game needs them BotW seems like itll need a lot of buttons this could explain it?.

When in game is about ready isnt that the perfect time to put together marketing materials?Listen Im about as skeptical of because Nintendo arguments as anybody but this is hardly a big deal and third parties care about a successful launch not how they get there. If Nintendo is planning a last minute marketing blitz or some other strategy they will be on board especially if it cuts marketing costs. There have been studies that show that the single biggest factor in game sales is word of mouth. If Nintendo reveals things in a way that leads to serious chatter any friction that does exists will be smoothed over quick. Seriously it feels like people who want a reveal are working backwards from that and making up reasons why Nintendo needs to reveal. Chill Winston. ,NintendoNX,d8fk20w,4,t5_37fk0

9184586,0,t1_d8g5xx5,LOL im glad everybody here is at least convinced by the development logic side.well for starters  i could make the example of Continuum for Windows  on smartphones. microsft gives the freedom of having a scaled desktop out of your phone. like it or not but its an option.and to not repeat myself in another comment heres what i can say differently about NX.in the past you had differences in buttons layouts between portable console and non portable. gameboy had a few buttons n had a lot and you couldnt hope to cross them without questionable results though in the  bulky appearence was everywere as a kid you didnt really care of appearances right SEGA nomad?.today the layout of a ds and a psvita is practically complete if our reference for a full controller is the  pad of course we dont have analog triggers but thats it. if im correct sony already gives freedom to use the psvita as a controller not talking about streaming the game although is similar and you can use the DS as a controller in the latest smash bros i consider this a little clue of whats to come clearly nintendo was experimenting some formula with smash bros. wiiu.i totally agree that playing smash bros on a DS layout and playing it on a gcube pad is totally different in fact if i organize with my friends a smash bros night everyone is bringing thier pro pad but if you could make the layout comfortable enough here the rumors about detachable controllers could help the theory you could sell everything in one pack and say hey costumers nintendo is with you wherever you go if you buy this one console. you dont need to buy a second PRO pad to play on your TV. out of the box deal.of course this doesnt mean you HAVE TO make a hybrid you could make different models and make the costumer choose. but i dont see either the originality here nor the justification for detachable controllers. but again i see your point just guessing here.,NintendoNX,d8g7p83,3,t5_37fk0
9184672,0,t3_55xfv7,They probably wont let the NX play DS games. The DS is supposed to continue its lifespan till  if I remember correctly it will still have software support till then.

9200594,0,t3_56cjgv,I think its still a possibility just maybe not how were picturing. I remember Iwata saying they want future hardware to be a family of devices with a shared OS  so I think whatever launches in March will be one form of the NX platform. The handheld docks to the TV and gets a little boost for k gaming like the n expansion pack takes cartridges. Maybe it could also stream tofrom existing  consoles Wii UNew DS. Holiday season the home version launches with a beefed up version of the same hardware e.g. power caps removed from gpu substantially more ram etc. has exclusive games takes discs AND cartridges and acts like a hub network storage for all your Nintendo devices. With both devices wirelessly synced gpuintensive processes can be distributed between them at developers discretion. The handheld can then be used for dual screen gameplay ingame video chat VR kinectstyle motion control and more.

Your typing English is better than most whove grown up speaking it better than mine too lolI think youre entirely correct If indeed the NX is a hybrid in hardware then Nintendo have a difficult time ahead of them making it appeal to both the console and handheld consumers.In my opinion the best way to appeal to both is not to unify the hardware but the software. Create both a moderately powerful console and separate handheld. Make the software the hybrid!Whether the NX is a console and portable or a hybrid with a dock developers are in for a doozy of a challenge. At least with two separate pieces of hardwarehopefully within the same power bracket developers have the choice to optimize for one or both.I dont know how they would optimize regardless which way Nintendo takes it but to me it feels like it would be easier with two different devices running similar architecture and software.But eh Im not too smart.

The casuals etc are lost to mobile and all thats left are those that predominantly prefer the content on the consoles you mentioned content that Nintendo doesnt make wont get and even if it does theyll likely need to moneyhat third parties and even then due to the likely tech in the NX those ports wont be at the resolution FPS etc etc found on rival systems. People arent going to broaden their horizons not enough en masse to buy a whole new system so the most we can realistically expect now IMO is for Nintendo to carve its own niche and remain profitable.EDIT Itd also help if Nintendo actually take on board the wishes of their fanbase sometimes to not to mention sort themselves out when it comes to the marketing side of things.,NintendoNX,d8r3sk8,2,t5_37fk0

9273606,0,t3_57f7vx,The basic premise here simply isnt true. Many companies have shown that its possible to announce a product and sellout the very next day. The keys to doing so are A capturing attention and B communicating value.As long as Nintendo can spread a message the communicates the high value of their product it doesnt much matter when they start. If its a product that people will want then Nintendo simply has to make sure they hear about it. If its a product that people wont want then Nintendo is screwed either way.So how can Nintendo make sure that the world hears about their product?Step  Remind the world that you exist. Maybe show up on stage at a really well attended event say... an iPhone reveal press conference.Step  Followup previous appearance with some kind of well publicised act. I dunno maybe release a Mario game for the iPhone or something.Step  Continue to pursue press recognition with other very well known companies. Perhaps they could have a big announcement that theyve partnered with a major theme park company and discuss plans for it or something.Step  Reveal new product.Step  Advertise the snot out of new product. Superbowl ad anyone?Step  Sell product. Step  swim naked in rivers of dollar bills.,NintendoNX,d8rhv4d,2,t5_37fk0

9276436,0,t1_d8ruam1,I actually want Nintendo to embrace a wider market. I dont believe this subreddit or places like it will have much if any effect on Nintendos plans but the people here are to be a factor in terms of generating word of mouth I think the best thing for average people way to take away before the reveal is that Nintendo fans are super excited. After the reveal it will be best if people think that any angry Nintendo fan is not someone that is going to affect how they view the NX or perhaps someone whos being so unfair that if they dont like the NX it must be good. I dont mean to say anything bad about most people who like Nintendo or even consider themselves fans but its unhealthy to generate a significant part of ones identity from liking a game company a ton and feeling like your part of a club that excludes lesser people who dont. I think that does go on here and people who do that are in for a shock because they are never going to be who Nintendo targets. ,NintendoNX,d8rurz2,1,t5_37fk0

It sounds wishywashy that she says maybe but this could change but that is essentially what reporting is. I mean I could play devils advocate and say she posts likely but untrue stuff alongside the truth to avoid the insider being exposed but I doubt this.I dont necessarily like or dislike her but I certainly have more respect for her than d printers and photoshoppers. And her articles are not terrible to read. If you dont believe her fine dont. Thats part of being an informed audience but these flame posts seem excessive. Id say at the very least shes reaching an audience outside of this sub getting hype and we need hype from all sources if the NX is going to succeed not just k sales from us.TLDR? The flame posts are old and annoying they dont bring anything new to the table news or controversy and no one is forcing you to read her stuff. Shes not mainstream. And as a woman Im just happy that she isnt a streamer wearing cat ears or a weebawoo. ,NintendoNX,d8ymqch,11,t5_37fk0

9330224,0,t3_58a5c0,gtNintendo is selling a console that will most likely be less powerful than the original Playstation Xbox One modelsbased on what? havent heard anything concrete saying more or less just speculation from both sides.gtNintendo will probably lack strong third party support once againfrom accounts third parties love the ease of development.gtNintendo probably wont even let me watch DVDs despite that shit being around since the PS Nintendo is a gaming company. They dont make anything else but gaming hardware. They dont have the resources that sony has. I have enough dvd and bluray players that I dont need another. I wont be made Nintendo hardware doesnt include one. Besides they will mostly likely have the staples on there. Stuff like Netflix Amazon Vudu and other streaming services.gt Yet Nintendo carries this demeanor like we should be excitedBecause of their strong first party titles. We love the shit outta titles like Smash Bros Mario Kart Mario Party Donkey Kong Country and Metroid.gtFor what? For better looking Marios and Zelda?I see no one complaining. People will gladly take p resolutions of their beloved franchises.gtI love their first party games as much as the next person but I want a console where I can play Mario Kart and Battlefield .We would all love that but we havent heard a peep from EA... yet. Things might change at the reveal or post reveal. But with EA having a rocky history of supporting Nintendo. They wont be allowed to say anything until the veil comes off and the world knows of what the NX is.yeah... my thoughts.,NintendoNX,d8yo9sp,1,t5_37fk0

9341886,0,t1_d8zw8vg,Basically all youve said is I have absolutely no idea how different architectures play together and Im incredibly up my own ass about how it should even though I have literally zero information on it.gtIfuckingmagine if computers worked that way.Uh they do?  Try to run an old Windows  game on Windows .  Good luck.And Windows uses the same architecture.  Running a  game on  is hard enough.  Doing it on a whole new architecture is like trying to transplant an animal brain into a human body.  It doesnt work.  Theyre not made up of the same things and thus arent compatible.They would either have to heavily modify literally every game or come up with multiple emulators for the various systems.  Building an emulator that works accurately is not a small task.  Even NESSNES emulators still arent perfect on PC.  There would have to be a minimum of  new emulators maybe .  Not happening especially not on launch because its not that important.If youre so incompetent that youre going to leave pissy comments about how things should be even though you dont even have a beginners understanding of them maybe you shouldnt leave the comments at all.,NintendoNX,d905gh9,6,t5_37fk0

Time Warner and ATampT are merging because having a cable channel isnt enough. You need to stream it to devices now. Xbox is giving up the TV. Digital downloads can be played on Xbox or Windows the DirectXbox. Sony has said the entire purpose of the PS Neo is to top people from abandoning the TV for computers to game.There might be something to this. The Switch will work with TVs and will be hooked up to mine. But you and I might be in the minority.Seems he was right in this prediction.,NintendoNX,d95z283,1,t5_37fk0
