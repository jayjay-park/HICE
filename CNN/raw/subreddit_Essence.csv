Hes with the demon hunting organization that weve always had trouble with.. He is extremely skilled in the art of stealth and prefers to assassinate rather then fight.. His left eye is a demons eye.. It can give him our regenerative powers and speed.. And the more he uses it he starts growing demonic features like horns and wings.. According to intel he doesnt like using these powers simply because they are demonic.  They are his last resort..Kuroun laughed.. And thats just him.. Just wait till you hear about his partner..,Essence,cgtlpg2,1,t5_30fwh
