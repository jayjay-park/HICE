The new ones are much nicer and built under new ownership I believe.In my opinion a cuddy turns into wasted space in the blazing hot summer sun unless it has AC. Unless you have kids I would avoid it a CC will be much more versatile in your area. I have a TTop on mine for shade.   Some CCs especially the family layout type offer a head inside the console. Look for an early s Hydrasport Vector CC with head in console and fourstroke power. Or a mid s Sea hunt Triton. Those might land in your budget. Or maybe a Pioneer sf.

Search any boating forum  the GPS update frequency is perfectly adequate for marine navigation. Again  this is assuming one has the iPad with integrated GPS chips not the WiFionly models.Ive run mine sidebyside with my Simrad NSS evo using Navionics Garmin and iNavx apps. There is zero discernible difference in chartplotting accuracy.Where high speed GPS does come into play is completely irrelevant to standalone navigation apps  be they on an iPad or more traditional chartplottersounder devices.

There is a spot perhaps  to the side where I could bring it up on land but from that location getting it back to my property becomes very problematic. Not undoable but problematic.The third is more of a preference thing. Ive grown up on docks and have never been a fan of floating docks. I much more prefer fixed docks in situations where the water level doesnt change much this is the case for my lake.All that said Im asking because Im considering replacing my existing dock and I want to be sure to consider all realistic options.

4157865,0,t1_crtsfe3,Seriously  I was at a friends house riding jetskis when one of my friends hit a rope that was attached to a cinderblock on the bottom of the lake.  He was barely moving  hardly any throttle at all when BOOM!  he hit that rope.  The jetski jerked all  of rope up and pulled it so hard that it jerked the cinderblock up into the bottom of the jetski.  This particular jetski I havent been under many so dont know if theyre all like this had a  steel grate covering the shaft  that cinderblock totally bent that grate all up into that shaft too.  It was all instantaneous  a loud boom the jetski cut off and that was it.  After looking around and realizing what had happened we pulled the jetski up on one of the boat lifts sideways and I climbed underneath cut the block loose how it didnt break Ill never know then removed the grate.  Turns out it was nylon rope and it had melted all around that shaft  again this was all instantaneous.  How it melted that quick too I dont understand.  It took us literally all day to remove all that crap from that shaft semi straighten out the grate and put it all back together.  And that was on a jetski and this happened right in front of an empty lift that we were able to conveniently just push it up on.

However the idea that stainless  ruined gearcase is not the whole story.

I doubt people in LA need to do this but I have no idea.Are the floorboards and transom solid?  If not dont buy it.  Too expensive for a fix to be practical.  A  will have wooden floors.  Newer boats have fiberglass floors.  If the boat was kept relatively dry over the years youll be fine.  But if you jump on the floors and they ate spongy theyre going to need to be replaced.Does it have necessary safety equipment?  Life jackets uptodate flares emergency flag throwable cushion etc?  The little stuff adds up.  From the pic it looks like you need new bumpersfenders.  Youll need dome new linesropes too.Detailing  The boat in the pic needs a nice waxing rug cleaning and upholstery cleaning.  You can do it yourself or have a boat detailer do it for  or so.Given the age Ill predict that its overdue for a new canvas cover.   or so.SlipMarina  Personally I keep my boat in the water.  Im in the Great Lakes.  In saltwater areas they use rack storage.  I use the boat a lot more because I dont have to worry about trailering it.  Well worth the expense.  Gas  if you fill it up at a regular automobile gas station you will save a lot of money.  If you fill it up on the water expect to pay  more per gallon.Sea Ray is a good brand.

5161334,0,t3_3lmkgi,Im a service writer for my fathers boatyard. I can tell you boat sales are though the roof here in Florida. Were a Bayliner Bluewave and Carolina Skiff dealer. We cant keep any of them in stock. I would pin the average age to people in their mid s however. Boats are ultimately toys and nothing more. Recreational loans are tough to pay since the banks know as soon as shit goes bad its the toys that are going to be the first thing to go. So intrest is through the roof on boat loans alone then factor in service and drydocks if you dont have a personal dock the price rapidly shoots through the roof.Boating is an expensive hobby. You need a lot of disposible income to really persue boating. I dont think a lot of people really comprehend the cost of owning and maintaining a boat. Until they buy one and realize how expensive it is. I get a lot of people who buy shitty boats from Craigslist it breaks the first time they go out in it and theyre completely turned off from boats in general. Cant say I blame them Im still amazed when people buy things off craigslist and bring it in for service and there ends up being a  bill because the person that owned the boat before stopped taking care of it because it was so damn expensive.The only boat I have personally own is a little ft Cat Hull fishing boat with a hp Yamaha on it and I only have that because my father sold it to me for less than what he even paid for it since I was starting to really enjoy fishing. I wouldnt get anything bigger because I personally dont have the income to maintain anything else. This costs me a few hundred bucks a year to have and other than that it takes care of itself as long as you treat it properly.I guess for perspective and price and whatnot my father who owns the marina has a ft pace that he dumps a couple thousand in a year to keep it up and going. I think last time I asked him hed put over  into it since he bought it and repowered it to twin big blocks. I like boats and boating but never in my wildest dreams could I justify that kind of money. It takes a special type of person with deep pockets to be a boating enthusiast.,boating,cv84s58,3,t5_2qm9s

Why so much?Its a combination where the first one is a steep learning curve and youll want to pay attention to get it right. Otherwise you have to take it all apart and do it again. Secondly older motorsdrives that have not been serviced recently have a way of loving to not come apart. Corroded bolts frozen gaskets calcium buildup etc. can make it absolute hell to split an upper and lower if it hasnt been done recently. I would honestly consider how much maintenance you want to do in the future. If you want to learn and continue doing stuff yourself get a shop manual for your motor and go to it.

I mean terminals are just little metal things unless they are completely corroded away I am not sure what you mean when you say bad. I realize this is your first boat but you should make sure you have continuity at the ground wire first. Make sure to identify which wire in the loom is ground and proceed from there. This wire should connect to the starter solenoid in some fashion. The other wire is your positive from the keyswitch to the starter solenoid. ,boating,d5tx8zh,1,t5_2qm9s

8936104,0,t1_d7lygux,I wont lie... the boat was in the water too long without a haul and the zincs were gone probably  months ago.That coupled with an electrical system that was wonky previous owners neglect plus lack of experience for us probably was the killer.  The props need reconditioning and the struts and rudders survived... but the shafts got destroyed.  So since out  day haul is now a  day haul we are making damned sure that this boat is squared away and good to go.Its been a long  days... and its gonna be a longer  maybe ? weeks before we are safe and running.....mainly because we screwed up.... but if we zinced the boat up right the problem probably would have been a bit easier to correct.Honestly we had a lot of below the water line issues that would have come up even without electrolysis problems and they could have sank the boat.  We are very fortunate to have an amazing neighbor with a lifetime of experience to walk us through the repairs while educating us.  Its a tough night but at the end of the day we have an unbelievable friend who knows this kinda stuff and is willing to work with us teach us and save us literally thousands of dollars in labor.Anyway if I remember to I will snap a few pics of the damage... but Im torn.  Im not sure I wanna remember how jacked up the shafts are....  ,boating,d7lzkde,2,t5_2qm9s
9025075,0,t3_53q82v,I think any of the pilothouse fishing boats made by NMI Northwest Marine Industries such as Seasport CDory Osprey and Skagit Orca are all pretty comfortable boats for the San JuansB.C. etc. They make a minimum of usually . You can sometimes find the older  Skipper made by Seasport that I think they stopped making in the late s. CDorys although a flat bottom and a little bit slower are great for fuel economy and fishing platform. It really all depends on what you want to do and what you want to spend. ,boating,d7wo7vu,2,t5_2qm9s

9475685,0,t3_5ajv41,I unnecessarily rebuilt my carbs. They were pristine clean and the new parts looked identical in every way to the old parts. They had probably been rebuilt not that long ago. No difference in running. In fact Ive had more problems with the float valves sticking since the rebuild not sure if its related.It wasnt an expensive job or a particularly difficult job but it was pretty time consuming mostly just taking off all the other crap that was in the way cowl frame starter solenoid coil switchbox stop plate etc off and then putting all that other crap back on.

10046875,0,t3_5j9s9k,Theyre fun as hell to ride but not terribly practical.  They are a toy for having fun.  They are not a mode of transportation. For the price of a jet ski you can buy a basic boat that will actually have room to take a friend or two and some beer albeit at a lower speed.  As for the annoyance factor its all about the user.  Newer stroke ones are much quieter and less obnoxious but they can still be very annoying if someone is using them irresponsibly.  Just be respectful of other boaters and homeowners near the water and youll be fine.,boating,dbh4th1,1,t5_2qm9s
10241562,0,t3_5mlwhe,I would recommend doing an inspection such as would be done on a small aircraft. Compression check verifies rings and cylinders. Check for excessive blow by use the crankcase vent system to make sure smoke isnt pouring out at running temp. Verify oil pressure verifies bottom end not cold either you want a running temperature engine. Buy the same type of oil filter that is on the boat remove what is there cut it open and inspect for metal.. Remove the outdrive bottom plug and inspect the magnet for metal drive lube will need replaced for whatever is drained during this. Review the color of the drive live and note any presence of water.. Remove the belt and give the water pump a wiggle if it is loose it is near replacement time.. Go over the engine while running at temp and look for water leaks.. Notice shifts from forward to reverse listen for more than one clunk.. Verify that the steering is tight.. Take a sample of the power steering fluid if equipped smell for a burnt smell look for cleanliness water etc.. Run the trim motors through the full range watch for times where the motor is running but outdrive is not moving review the cylinders for leakage look at the fluids again.May not all be necessary but if you want some detail that would get you past a lot of possible expensive repairs.,boating,dc4xs7h,1,t5_2qm9s

10342583,0,t3_5o3nbj,Ive seen it done. Then again I also saw someone launch and not retrieve a  cuddy Bayliner with a Ford TEMPO. On the TN River. On a ft X  wet ramp. I watched him destroy the transaxle and get Powerstroked to safety by a concerned Ford owner.  I digress.          Your trailer will likely weigh X what a Jon will so gather info on your gear and do the math. Im sure youve seen Honda Civics and the like towing SeaDoos around. These things can be  long and weigh s dry weight wo the trailer. Tongue weight here is critical. You want around  of gross trailer weight to be tongue weight. Having an engine fuel tank and battery in the stern will take some weight off of the tongue. Be sure to install wiring for lights when you install your hitch. Avoid filling your boat to the gunwale with stuff. Pack your cooler inside the car for the trip!Use better judgement at the ramp. Avoid slimy summer ramps and icy winter ramps. At the very least use a  ball on your trailer. This way if you are not confident launching and retrieving you can bribe another boater into using their vehicle most times a couple beers will get it done.Be safe and always wear a life jacket.

10369038,0,t3_5ohtse,So you bid a job got the job and now you are upset for bidding the job too low so you want to screw the customer over by doing inferior work?  I had an upholstery guy do exactly that to me several years ago. I made sure that everyone in my marina and the marina next to us saw the crappy job and knew who did it. ,boating,dcje4zc,1,t5_2qm9s
10373077,0,t3_5oif0a,Before you get started find a place to dispose of the fuel. Buy a small electric fuel pump at the auto parts store and some appropriately sized hose and clamps. You can hook the pump directly to the hose coming from the tank to the engine. Suck all the gas out into gas cans with the bow raised in the air. Locate the fuel gauge sender on top of the gas tank. Hopefully it will be towards the aft end of the tank. Remove the senders  screws and remove sender. Take the wires off if you have to. Connect a length of hose to the inlet of your pump and suck the last remaining gas water from the back bottom of the tank. Reinstall sender with a new gasket. Put fresh gas in and draw some through the system into a glass jar and look for cloudiness or straight water. Take a couple samples to make sure its coming out clear gas.  A fuelwater separating filter before the engine is a must. Change the filter if you already have one.   Let me stress the importance of being extremely careful with Gasoline. Do this job in a well ventilated area. The wires to your fuel pump should be long enough to go over the side and connect to a battery away from where gas vapors are present so you dont make a spark when connecting them in the presence of gas vapor. Be careful not to spill.  Once your system is purged of water If you have an outboard pull the carb bowl drain screws or vapor separator drain screw drain and push fresh fuel up through the system with the drains open until fresh fuel comes out then plug em up. Fuel injected engines may require a couple of cycles of the high pressure pump and another draining of the vapor separating tank to purge water from the fuel rail. If you have an inboard you may have to take the top off the carb and sop the water out of the float bowl. Fuel injection systems vary but you may have to open the high pressure side and purge the system. Can be messy.   Check your vent and fill cap. Make sure the cap has a good seal. When you pull your sender make sure the gasket was sealing. These are all places water can get in. Try to run nonethanol fuel.  Edit Add some fuel conditioner like Marine Stabil to your fresh fuel.,boating,dcjumln,5,t5_2qm9s

10743117,0,t3_5tom14,We bought a Chaparral jet boat last year after comparing it next to the Yamahas. We got a Vortex VR and absolutely love it. Great to drive crazy pickup and yes very low maintenance so far.  Theres a lot to be said about not having to worry about an outdrive though one word of warning is that if your in very shallow lakes you just need to be careful not to suck up too much sediment or weeds. Easy to clean out but never ideal. The other big plus regardless of brand is the interior layout on a jet boat is unmatched by similarly sized IO boats. The downside is that theyre quite a bit louder than IO. ,boating,ddo2koz,3,t5_2qm9s
