4955021,0,t1_cuiw4ig,The Punjab before british rule was a lot bigger than it is now as it was while it was under Sikh rule. The majority of it is now in what is known as Pakistan. People who live locally in either Pakistan or India still call it the Punjab. If someone is living in Pakistan and in the Punjab region they will proudly tell you where they are from. West Punjab is in Pakistan and Punjab is in India. The point I am making is that Punjab in Pakistan is easily bigger most of the Punjab is not in India.You can see this here  Delhi is a very different place in people and modernisation compared to the Punjab. He knows he can go and link up with a few decent players get some playing time and grow awareness for who he is back in that part of the world be it India or Pakistan. It helps him and it will help the club as I believe just like Saido he will be given his chance and he will step up to the mark. The club will benefit no doubt that if he does well out there which he will do we will get exposure as a club.   ,WBAfootball,cuj4cmn,3,t5_2tivu

6405134,0,t1_czhownv,Lambert is pretty poor Rondon and Berahino should start over him anyday. Ive said it once and Ill say it again. We should be playing Berahino every game he is still one of our best players even if he isnt in great shape and he always scores. Yes he is a bit of a prick but Pulis should still be playing him  By not playing him we are not going to get any money for him. Even still its a League One side and we shouldnt have been letting in two goals let alone playing that poor. The team seems really uninspired at the moment.,WBAfootball,czhp5q8,4,t5_2tivu

10418165,0,t1_dcoynbf,Absolutely not many fans will not go to spite Pulis IMO. He has the brand of dull defensive football engrained in his name. But it may get some fans back in to check out this new star signing. Heck who am I kidding... its the Albion haha. Look at when we were on the winning streak under Clarke and had Lukaku and Odemwingie leading the line... sell outs practically every week. That star player helped yes we were attacking and scored and won mostly every other home game.. We need the Hawthorns to be a fortress again ,WBAfootball,dcoytxq,5,t5_2tivu
10550985,0,t1_dd3mm8g,Hopefully we will but even if we do it wont be the quality we were all hoping for and yes Id say livermore was a very solid signing its just I think there were positions in more need of back upreplacement,WBAfootball,dd42mka,2,t5_2tivu

If we come th or th we are guaranteed a European spot  also duh.If we come th then we need ONE of League Cup and FA Cup to go to a top  team. If we come th we need BOTH. Luckily right now that math is real simple if were not weighting the clubs strength which the odds above do.League Cup Manchester United won and has an  chance to stay in the top  teams per SportsClubStats.FA Cup The guarantee of Chelsea vs Man U balances the fact that Man City still needs to play their R replay giving us an overall  chance here due to having one T horse in each quarterfinal.So using those odds we can roughly calculate our total odds of Europe stth .    . th .    . th .      .Total ...  .
