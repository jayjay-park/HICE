3715720,0,t1_cqf7t84,I would get a pump that is overkill and put an inline ball valve after the pump to control flow. You will never get the exact pressure you want without being able to control it manually. As far as how many netpots it depends on the plants you plan on growing. I would only do    for each of those tubs. more than that and you are going to get a little crowded. Also rhydro is more active than rHydroponics. ,Hydroponics,cqftgxt,1,t5_2qsim

6166610,0,t3_3zzdxv,You also need to look at what you plan on growing and what works best for that crop. Not all plants will react the same under LEDs. ,Hydroponics,cyqkvkl,1,t5_2qsim
6349587,0,t3_42lrlh,As a woody perennial blueberries may be fairly difficult.  Im not saying impossible but certainly more difficult than say strawberries.  First blueberries are insect pollinated.  So presuming youre doing this indoors youll need to play that role yourself.  Second youll need to determine if your varieties can self pollinate.  Some must be planted alongside a different variety in order to get a successful cross pollination.  Third blueberries will need a period of dormancy winter after you harvest the fruit in order to get set up for a new round of flowering.  Im not sure how you would induce that indoors.  But probably a combination of shorter days reduced fertilizer and lower temperatures.  ,Hydroponics,czbdlhj,3,t5_2qsim

6768084,0,t3_47z6w6,Hey there! Im having the same problem. Im currently in an apartment and want to start hydroponics. I kinda wanna turn it into a research project for my universities aquaponicshydroponics club so I want to make it as cheap as possible for it to encourage more people to grow. The way I was thinking about it I was going to have a large shelving unit We have one with plants on it so this is where the idea sparked with the pvc piping hanging slanted from it and the lights fixed to the underside of the platform. On the upper most platform would be the water canisters with the drip irrigation line running down with the pvcpots. Im not going to go into much details about it unless you want me too but those were my ideas to save space here. And we have a cat as well. Im buying my stuff online through ebay. And also locally through home depot and a hydroponic store thats an hour away. Tons of herbs is fine they dont need much room. I wanted to grow two large plants on the bottom of the structure with the rest on the top as herbs. South facing window could be fine but be prepared to buy lights if the plants seem to over stretch or just look unhealthy. ,Hydroponics,d0jfxw5,1,t5_2qsim
8265359,0,t1_d5al8jd,Im using a a plastic trough with drain holes on the bottom.  The plants are sitting in coarse perlite.  Theres actually no rhizome its just the stem it sticks out of the medium completely.  My plants came from trimmings so I started with what was left of the stem surrounded by perlite.  The trimmings sent up leaves and eventually started growing roots.As far as nutrients since this is a small setup that I wasnt sure was even going to work I water them by hand with a fluid catch under the trough.  Im using the MasterBlend  I use for my tomatoes but diluted .,Hydroponics,d5aq77a,1,t5_2qsim

10933531,0,t3_5w0dnm,Honestly things are looking really good so far. You are not feeding them that level of nutrient as soon as they sprout though right? You want to let them get a good couple of true leaves on them before you start any nutrients and then go half strength for a few days first. There is no reason to change your nutrients every week but I have read that many places as well. In fact I dont change my nutrients at all unless I get a problem such as pythium. I just add to my reservoir with fresh waternutrient solution. And yes my friend that white stuff is mold. Wait a few days and see if they sprout. If they do you might want to make them a soak of HO hydrogen peroxide and water and let them sit in it for  mins or so and then rinse with fresh water.,Hydroponics,de7ptey,2,t5_2qsim
