581137,0,t3_20rbma,I have tried most of them but the one I have actually paid money for is a subscriptions to Digitally Imported www.di.fm. Huge range of genres for electronic music. In case you dont know the service you cant choose music like Spotify and it doesnt learn from you like Pandora it just plays a selection of music based on the genre you select. But the selection is MASSIVE.,liquiddnb,cg6bvpm,2,t5_2saw8
736868,0,t3_22ljzz,One of my favourite mixes is a weekly one that a DJ over on DnBHeaven runs every wednesday. Cant recommend it enough I learned a lot and found a number of great new artists through him over the last year or so. He has a real keen ear for classy smooth jazzy happy etc vibes.His name is Q the Physicist here is his Soundcloud where he uploads his most recent ones for a few weeks to download. He is spinning another set in a few hours actually! Also feel free to check out DnBHeaven.com great little community with interactive DJs uploaded sets and tracklists etc.,liquiddnb,cgo1aoa,2,t5_2saw8
