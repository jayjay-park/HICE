I tried to reproduce his makeup I bought some Faygo from Amazon and I started listening to some ICP on Spotify in case someone decided to ask me if I could do part of one of their songs apart from Fuckin magnets! How do they work?.I was actually impressed with the production and with some of the lyrics. So I read up on them the Dark Carnival mythology the strange evangelical explanation they put forward and of course the Gathering.I dont actually like any of their music. But I no longer mock them.

5850223,0,t1_cxmh5eb,Im not saying all Muslims are tolerant and neither am I saying Islamic Iberia was perfectly tolerant. What I am saying is that there are examples of Islamic societies like Iberia being much more tolerant than their contemporaries  which you could argue says more about them than Muslim Iberia yeah because these were during the days when kingdoms like England were issuing edicts demanding all Jews leave their territory. But what that does demonstrate is Islam is not neccessarily a violently intolerant belief system because its system is built of people who determine what Islamic values mean in practice rather than being prescribed by literalist interpretations of scripture. What that shows is peaceful Muslims have as much relevance to a discussion of what it means to be Muslim as violent Islamists do  so the statement that the latter are more Muslim is incorrect.,TMBR,cxmhqvx,0,t5_2r99c

5944452,0,t1_cxyo4iz,Ask yourself this why is murder wrong?  From the way you worded things youre just saying murder is wrong because someone told you so.I believe the only reason why we perceive murder as wrong and illegal is because of religion.  The Ten Commandments told the people back then that murder was wrong and since a lot of Western nations were founded as Christian it was easy to sculpt out a law system that reflected the Ten Commandments and scripture.  Now that we are entering a postreligious era why are we still holding on to these archaic laws of the past?  Clearly we have done away with most of the Biblical laws.  Were just now starting to weed out the more explicit ones like homosexuality.So let me ask again why is murder wrong?  Because you say so?  What if I say murder isnt wrong?  Who is right?  If you are right what makes your point of view more right than mine?  Are you intrinsically better than me?  Are you God?Does society tell us that murder is wrong?  Maybe.  But again suppose another society exists that says murder is okay.  Who is right?  The Nazis thought exterminating the Jews was okay our society said that it was not okay.  The only reason why we view the Nazis as evil is because the Allies won WWII.  Imagine if the Nazis won.  History is written by the victors.  Maybe in this alternate universe our society would believe that the Nazis did everything right.You challenged me to find a nihilist who would try to kill me.  I tell you that is impossible.  There are no true nihilists.  No one can truly live consistently with that philosophy.  If there was they would go literally insane.  If one was to live out the life of a nihilist morality doesnt exist what is common knowledge is just an illusion even language means abluka majdane oprihije knokar pelrogd.  Manjakefgra ightesafg jikkadga you get what I mean.But you asked me to look for the beauty in humanity so Ill finish this off with that.  Isnt it amazing how in spite of conflicting philosophies differently assigned life purposes and gradually changing legal systems we can still for the most part somehow all agree that hurting each other is wrong?  Call it societal religiously assigned selfvalues or what not a lot of the world agrees and considering the diversity of the world getting everyone to agree on anything is a pretty daunting task.

5958761,0,t3_3x17u6,Our species was able to live sustainably on this planet for thousands of years passing down an earth capable of providing for generation after generation. Now we are so far removed from our sustainable roots that it will require an entire overhaul of our infrastructure and institutions to rebalance the climate and this needs to start NOW. The hysteria isnt just about what is to come its about what has already been happening.The impacts of climate change are and will be plentiful but here are two examples of some changes that will greatly impact how our children survive on this planetMass extinction all of the mass extinctions in earths history have one thing in common  CO. Weve already lost half of our wildlife in the past  years. That to me is worth hysteria but what happens when we lose half of our SPECIES in the next . Climate refugees rising sea levels and devastating storms will hit the poorest citizens first. The Maldives home to  people has a maximum elevation of . meters lt feet. Some scientists believe weve already lost low level island nations like this. We simply cant comprehend the kind of changes that are to come because never in recorded history has humanity faced a challenge like this. It is easy to say that since climate change is moving slow and technology is moving fast that well solve the problem before it causes too much harm but this would be making the same mistake that our parents and grandparents made that got us into this mess in the first place.

My most recent thing and something I dont necessarily have a Biblical basis for is God brings people to Himself all across the world even in places the Bible isnt taught indigenous countries places where its outlawed etc. The most good outcome is for people to learn of Jesus sacrifice. Its hard especially considering I dont really have a basis for that thought. I want to research it but two things  Im afraid of confirmation bias.  Im lazy. Im only having this conversation since Im at work with nothing to do.Second the genocidal rampage was only for the first several books of the Old Testament. That doesnt excuse it I just want to clarify I mean even though later books like Daniel Esther etc. Heck some of the later Prophets are all about how angry God is Amos is very much You guys dun goofed!Finally there is no justification for slavery but I wonder if theres no leeway at all for ancient cultures being ancient cultures. Surely slavery is never good but slavery was the norm and harsh treatment like in the American South preCivil War was less common in the Ancient Near East. I just feel looking down our noses and condemning the Bible for not condemning slavery condoning it yes thousands of years before it became a culturally immoral thing to do... it feels a bit off.

6421170,0,t3_43lgnr,Part of the issue here is the ground the argument for theism does not have.Even agreeing with your definitions. If all we have is our senses and perception of the world around us then Im afraid thats that. The status quo the current ground every bit of evidence Humanity haspoints to the nonexistence of any GodGods. Anything else is just simple conjecture until there is any actual evidence we can provide for it.. Atheists have no reason to prove anythingagain their world view supports the status quo by way of seeing all that is and nothing more. We provide evidence of the history of humanity and the universe and thats it.In turn. Its up to any religion to provide sufficient proof to change that which some agnostics might say could happen but an atheist would say with certainly wont happen because.... All religious beliefs rely on faith which by definition have no actual proof that can be humanlyphysically percieved beyond simple claims and individual testimony.. Religions are clearly a humanconstruct a byproduct of history and humans attempting to comprehend the world in a way that works for them at that time. If there were a deity in any form they most certainly wouldnt take the form of any humanconstructed GodGods humans have culturally created. They would not fit biblical stories or religious texts as they were human constructs as well and this theoretical being exists outside of them.And finally.... If there were such a being and there were no way to percieve them outside of conjecture and guessing what would be the point in even attempting to percieve it? If they existed outside the rules of reality as we see it then they most certainly would exist outside of human notions of perception periodthey might not even be a they they might not even be able and since the consequences of this belief wouldnt matter in the slightest they dont even need to be to have the same level of existence they have nownothing. At most they could be called a guess.EDIT and yes Im afraid your evidence for the random result of evolution is incorrectly founded. Evolution is largely a byproduct of natural selection.Charles Darwin himselfgtLife results from the nonrandom survival of randomlyvarying replicators.Natural selection is the process by which species with random variances all species including Humans even at extremely small levelsperception intelligence physical attributesare favored for survival over the course of millions of years. Thanks to dominant and recessive genetics procreation of a species follows that favors these specific genetic differences and over time that propagated species evolves as a larger and larger portion of the population is born with those favorable traits.

The earth was created by matter being acted on by the fundamental forces.Youre starting off with the assumption that all things have a creator.  Unless you can prove that premise any conclusions you come to from said premise are not necessarily true.gt The universe exists and therefore must have been created. Since the universe is the greatest thing we are currently aware of there must be a creator that created the universe as we know it perhaps seeding the Big Bang. This creator while not necessarily infinitely great must at least be of similar greatness as the universe.Define greatness.  However youre using clearly doesnt fit the standard definition of the quality of being great distinguished or eminent.Why would the creator have to be as great or greater than the creation?  Thats just an unfounded assertion.Using unproven premises and unfounded assertions in a model when they provide no falsifiable claims is illogical and thus irrational.Tldr  The example you gave was based on an unproven premise and had unfounded assertions.

For the fuller version please see my articles What about Violent Religions? Is God Really Bloodthirsty and Vengeful? and What is the Wrath of God? Why was the Old Testament God so Angry yet Jesus was so Peaceful?gt Isnt it intellectually dishonest to make objective truth claims that you know are subjective?Ultimately everything we know is based on subjective experience. Even science is based on experience. Can we really claim that all of its conclusions are objectively factual? Science itself makes no claim that its conclusions are proven. And beyond that in reality most of what we know we know because someone told us so. We ourselves did not conduct and verify all of the scientific experiments on which our knowledge of the nature and workings of the physical world is based. We know these things because they come from sources that we trust. I could say that its intellectually dishonest to make objective truth claims about all of these things that we think we know but that we have not actually verified for ourselves to be true. But that would be ridiculous.We build up a picture of reality based on our own experiences and on what others have taught us. Ultimately all of it is somewhat subjective and based largely on other peoples experiences.So no I dont think it is intellectually dishonest to make truth claims I never said objective about God and about spiritual reality.

8372483,0,t3_4u96oy,I think youve addressed some of the basic problems and inefficiencies in the public school system but I think your solution is overcomplicated and adds even more baggage to a system where I think less is needed. Youve talked about the importance of performance and youve talked about using standardized tests to measure performance. At that point all you would need is an incentive to teach kids to pass these standardized tests. Everything else and I mean everything else is unnecessary. One way you could incentivize teaching is by implementing your rd point allow students to attend any school and credit schools based on the number of students enrolled. At that point you wouldnt need PhD approved curricula teaching licenses standardized teaching methods required textbooks or most other regulations because it would already be in a schools best interest to educate children as effectively and efficiently as possible in order to attract more students and make more money. Any teaching method or teacher that is effective at educating students will be adoptedhired by schools in order to compete with other schools.A more direct though possibly more complicated incentive would be to pay teachers directly for every standardized test their student passes. All the materials needed for educators to teach students could be online and for the most part already is online. From there educational institutions would selforganize to compete for students and teachers in order to make money. Because teachers are paid per test a student passes this system encourages teachers to be good at their jobs in order to pass more students and attract new students. It also allows stayathome parents to earn money by educating their own children.If results are all that matter then we dont need highschool diplomas or even highschools for that matter. No public schools no PhD approved curricula no teaching licenses no required textbooks and no standardized teaching methods are necessary. All that matters is what works and the results would speak for themselves. This would allow greater flexibility adaptation and specialization with regards to where how and from whom students can acquire the tools to learn on their own. I think the goal of publicly funded education shouldnt be to teach kids everything just enough for them to teach themselves anything.,TMBR,d5o3zfj,2,t5_2r99c

8456978,0,t3_4vhwkc,I disagree modern technology and automation is making it easier and easier to farm and genetically modified crops can provide fantastic yeilds that are both safe to eat and resistant to disease. Cities are able to hold more people than ever before and both mass transit and global telecommunications are making it easier to stay connected. Movements towards a more leftwing systems of government are the first steps to a Utopian society where work is optional. People dont need to work we do so as a social construct and because we need money but really money is again just a social construct that well likely grow out of fairly soon. Moving to a resource based and media based economy where all people have a universal wage and basic standard of living will be the next step for society. Were already forcing this and with developments in cheap energy and D printing well soon be in a situation where replicators are near enough in existence.Our current society has its limits but limits change as society changes and I see the path forwards as an interesting middleground between capitalism and communism. I expect a resource based economy to soon take over with universal wages in the west soon becoming the norm. Socialism is already the largest political ideology in Europe and the rise of Bernie Sanders as a serious presidential candidate shows that those ideas arent demonised in USA any more. China is becoming less Authoritarian slowly but still and developing its Communist ideologies to incorporate more Capitalist elements. Theres a merging of ideas happening and I expect there will be a new automation system soon enough that will make the need for jobs obsolete. Society is actually holding back technology at the moment. People needing to work for money is preventing automation and advancement. Once we change our way of thinking well be able to progress again and well be able to continue to expand.,TMBR,d5ynnzc,1,t5_2r99c

8546170,0,t1_d69td5y,Is there a risk associated with relying on certain technological advances humanity has made and will make? Well maybe sure. Are we guaranteed to survive everything that nature might confront us with in the future? Probably not.However I think the way you bring evolution into this is much more confusing than enlightening and I guess ultimately fallacious. In particular making a fundamental distinction between natural and artificial really confuses what is actually going on. Look at it this way As far as evolution by natural selection is concerned hospitals and social security systems are just extended phenotypes of the human genome. They are simply part of the evolutionary strategy that humans seem to be following they or their precursorsthe preconditions in human behaviour were selected for by natural selection because they are successful at making humans reproduce. As such hospitals arent really all that fundamentally different from a termites mound. And more directly a huge brain isnt all that fundamentally different from a fast locomotive system of a predator. That simply happens to be one tradeoff that evolution by natural selection happens to have found A body thats physically not good for much but with a huge brain that consumes a lot of energy and is in general expensive to maintain which enables all those behaviours that allow these bodies to survive anyway by way of constructing huge supporting structures to enable survival and reproduction. As such it doesnt really make sense to call it a charade. Or artificial. That just is the survival strategy of humans and its a tradeoff as every evolutionary survival strategy is and it can fail if it is confronted with circumstances that it cant handle as every evolutionary survival strategy can. Wolves are much better at feeding themselves in the forest than humans are. But when they were confronted with these hugebrained animals and their extended phenotypes like guns they didnt fare all that well in many areas of the planet.Now should we maybe worry about the lack of robustness of some of our survival strategies? Sure might be a good idea. Does that mean that we should stop using our brains to make individuals survive in an attempt to let evolution do its job? No that would be plain idiotic. There is no indication that that would be in any way more robust than using our brains. If anything we should be using our brains more in order to figure out how to actually make our strategies more robust. Also mind you that evolution does not necessarily make any species stronger. Eliminating a species altogether is as valid a result from natural selection as is eliminating certain traits in a species. So if we were to give up the one big advantage that allows us to survive that could as well end with humanity being selected out of existence.,TMBR,d69uc5i,2,t5_2r99c

8964627,0,t1_d7pd7wt,I dont think your example applies correctly. The five people on the tracksfour on one side one on the otherwere all in the same amount of danger and it depended on which way the tracks turned. In the prison the guards are in no trouble at all while Peter is in prison. God pulled Peter out of prison so that he might continue with his plan and yes you are right that God knew what Herod would do but that does not make him responsible for the death.    Lets use a better example  A concentration camp holds a lone Jewish man. Allied troops come through and pull him out under the guards noses. A Nazi official questions the guards and in his fury he executes the guards. Under your presumptions the Allied troops are at fault. Do you stand by your argument?    Secondly lets address the verse you mentioned  gt isnt there a passage in the bible saying God would rather abandon  sheep from his flock to save  that left?    Youre talking about Matthew   gt  What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninetynine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?   And if he finds it truly I tell you he rejoices over it more than over the ninetynine that never went astray.  So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.    This parable operates under the context that the other  knew not to wander and to stay in safety where the shepherd instructed. And to preemptively counter rejoices more arguments relate it to how a mother feels about one sick child and one healthy child. It will seem that the mother is happier about the sick child becoming healthy than the other child never being sick in the first place logically they cannot be compared but a comparison provides emphasis on the joy of the childs healing.,TMBR,d7pevwy,2,t5_2r99c

For the purposes of this argument we can say that there is no evidence for any superstitious belief fairies astrology spirits fortune telling flatearth and indeed god.This is an issue of semantics. In a practical sense we all know that fairies dont exist. We all know that fortune telling doesnt have any real predictive merit. We all know that god doesnt exist.In a literal sense the statement god doesnt exist is inaccurate. Even if the probability of a god existing is unfathomably low there is no evidence forbidding the existence of a god.

9443153,0,t3_59u6fm,Hey I saw this and remembered a research paper I wrote in my first year of college. Its pretty complicated but thought it might be insightful. This topic is not a topic void of proof and I think people should know that. So here....Do you believe in the existence of God? Many of us would say yes while many of us would say no and oftentimes either answer will be defended zealously and a little too emotionally and in the end no one seems to change their belief. However I dont think communicating and persuading others should be this way. I believe solid proof obtained through logic is the best way to convince because it is for the most part nonsubjective and leaves the mental haziness of emotions out. As I believe in the existence of God I will show proof for my viewpoint in a way that is as objective as possible. Three important things that should be considered when determining if there is a God are the impossibly coincidental regularities of the universe how nothing in the natural world existed before itself in order to create itself and how if you assume no entity besides contingent beings like you and me exist then nothing would exist.Have you ever sat down and really thought about the astounding degree of orderliness in our universe? Everything seems to work together perfectly to make life on earth possible even things that we could easily take for granted. For example a colony of bees only pollinates one type of flower a day because plants can only reproduce with their own species even though this method of pollination has no benefit known to the bees or how the earth is the perfect distance from the sun if it were a mere one inch closer or further from it earths climate would be fatally frigid or scorching. There are also many natural regularities like how gravity and other laws of physics have always behaved in a consistent manner. these regularities in nature call for explanationa regularity is not something simple and unitary it is formed by a collection of separate instances which conform to a common pattern. It is hard to think that the conforming to this pattern over such a large number of cases is just a matter of chance  a mere coincidence. Foster John.  This is essentially saying that these regularities in the natural world cannot be just a matter of chance  they have occurred again and again over time in an innumerable amount of cases and therefore must have an explanation. The situation is  though on a grander scale  rather like that of tossing a coin a thousand times and finding that it comes up heads each time . If you got that outcome when flipping a coin wouldnt you think that there was a reason for it besides it being a coincidence? The regularities of nature are much more improbable for being by chance given that there are so many organized systems bodily processes laws of physics the solar system etc.. If you flipped heads on a coin a thousand times you might assume rather safely that someone made the coin act that way. Likewise it can be safely assumed that the universe has someone making it behave consistently God.One of the most wellknown laws of physics is Newtons First Law commonly known as the Law of Inertia which says any object without force impressed upon it will continue in its state of rest or motion ad infinitum Hanson. . If you push an object it will move until it eventually stops if the force gravity is present. However an object in rest will not just start moving by itself it needs something to initiate its motion. As it is seen frequently in everyday life most of us know this law well. Reality is in motion and the motion requires a mover. This is the beginning of an explanation of one of Saint Thomas Aquinass five proofs for the existence of God. On this particular level one can only proceed from one particular movement to its particular mover and would proceed indefinitely without reaching an explanation of the phenomenon of movement. In order to become intelligible the process of particular movement requires a first mover primum movens Voegelin Eric Herbert McCabe and Thomas Aquinas. . Basically someone God has to exist who could have started the motion we call reality and as nothing can be the cause of its own motion so too is it with reality it couldnt have initiated itself.Another one of St. Thomas Aquinas proofs for the existence of God is a Reductio argument and it is as follows Contingent beings are things that can exist or not exist. Assume that all beings are contingent. Since they are contingent there is a time when they didnt exist. It is thus impossible for these to always have existed. At that time there would have been nothing to bring them into existence. Therefore nothing would exist now. This is clearly absurd so a noncontingent or necessary being must exist Gracyk. Web.  In short .if there is no necessary being nothing exists Pike. . Although this still could easily seem hard to comprehend it is actually pretty simple. A necessary being is a being that does not owe its existence to another being. Contingent beings dont come into existence by their own will to exist. A contingent being cant just create itself from nothing. It wouldnt even think of creating itself because it doesnt exist! Something or someone has to be there to initiate the beings existence. For us as humans our parents gave life to us. This is similar to other life forms like how animals plants bacteria and members of kingdom Protista reproduce there are parents that give life to their offspring. But where did those parents come from? Instantaneously we realize that they obviously received life from their parents and so on and so on. However this cycle of living reproducing and dying cant go ad infinitum. At some point there had to have been a first one or two organisms to start this cycle. Even the simplest life forms like bacteria are so intricately designed that despite all of our studying and experimenting there is still so much about them that is clouded in mystery so we know that organisms dont generate from nothingness since they are very complicated and thus the chance of that happening would be unreasonably slim. Therefore some noncontingent entity had to be there to start all these cycles of contingent life. This being we refer to as God.Hopefully you can now understand how the idea of Gods existence is a rational one. It is not a mere primitive concept that people conjured up ages ago it is a logical theory that can be defended just like those of science can be defended. Of course there are many arguments regarding Gods existence that I didnt cover as this is a very complex subject that has been debated hotly innumerable times throughout the centuries. Even though I have only scratched the surface of this vast topic I feel nonetheless that I have given enough evidence to if not completely convince at least make one rethink ones view on this important subject. So do you believe in the existence of God?Works CitedFoster John. Regularities Laws of Nature and the Existence of God. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society   .

Because those horrible people used BiHydrogen monoxide it proves that it makes you violent props to all the commenters who get what chemical right but there is no correlation to any actual violent behavior . furthermore I am going to argue that more straight people are violent because there are more straight people. Simply put the group has more people in it thusly there is a higher chance that there are violent peopleYour second point is invalid I like kids my made up girlfriend likes kids we are not obsessed with having them. In fact most of the parents I know have one or two kids and stop The only people I see who are truly obsessed with having kids are the Duggers and the Mormon families who have seven or eight brats simply because the church asked them to.

Needs being good quality food shelter education a high standard of living for all humans. The incentive to work in such a society is for the benefit of all people. Meaning ifwhen we change our value systems and realize we must be a global society in order to survive we would use our skills to work where we benefit society. By the way we would only need a fraction of the workforce we have now because of automation. We dont yet have machines that do EVERYTHING for us but they can do damn NEAR everything. There is no such thing as utopia I want to be clear about that. We are an emergent and symbiotic organism. There will never be a point where we reach perfection just by the nature of the universe it will end or transform into something else given a long enough timeline. Edit Also I never said if we got rid of money all of a sudden we would be thriving. What I said was that if all the money and wealth in the world disappeared tomorrow we would not be in any worse shape than we are now. We would still have technology and the knowledge to provide for everyones needs. Scientists and doctors and engineers wont miraculously forget all of their knowledge because money vanishes. I understand its very hard to grasp the concept im talking about believe me it took a while to grasp it but its the best system I have heard of the best alternative to what we have now. To use the scientific method for social concern. Christ sake we have trump as the president. Finally now the world is slowly understanding how mad our society has become. Most people are just seeing an icecube on the tip of the iceberg that is our insane society. I dont mean to sound jaded I really do think we can achieve many great things and am forever grateful for the little things I take for granted everyday like basic care toilet paper and water. I understand there are people living in hell on earth and that I hit the lottery of life.

People have no clue that only  of the water on earth is fresh water and that most of that  is quietly owned by private entities already.

Poor people would still be poor only if we allowed that. We could provide for everyones needs like I said. There would be no central authority of resource management.

10019374,0,t3_5j55i4,Disagree.Redistributing wealth causes upset. The poorest wouldnt know how to handle a sudden influx of money and it would be wasted because for the most part they are accustomed to spending only a set limit either from busking or begging receiving welfare or pension committing crime etc. The richest would immediately put their money away much in the same way its hidden from taxes. There would be no desire to better ones self because all the needs are met with no effort. This leads to stagnation in a society much like Fahrenheit . People become complacent or trapped in receiving cheques and many end up staying in the cycle of living from pay cycle to pay cycle which is happening right now. Changing the amount doesnt change the person.The idea of owning something exists in many forms. Some predatory animals have their territory and will kill to keep it that way. Gangs drug dealers etc all follow that same rule which is separate from a system that legitimizes claims to property. Incentive is given not to steal because its a very primal urge to see something and want it for yourself or for the group which is no different than  wealth redistribution.  The fact is that no matter what there will always be someone with more than someone else. The robin hood idea is not viable because it creates hostility between those that work hard for what they have and those that think they are owed something. Socialism and Communism both tried that approach in certain regards and both utterly failed because it maintains nothing except control by the elite that have hidden their capital from the public.

10498788,0,t1_dcxwjh1,In my opinion you are correct here as well.  My reply was already long but I could have continued with many other ideas to address income inequality and many other issues we are facing in this country.As far as a very small percentage of Americans amassing most of the wealth.  The top  owns more wealth than the bottom .  You cant just go take it away from them.  And even with a solid economy you will still have a spectrum of wealth and income levels.  There will always be those that are wealthy and those that are not so.  What you can do however is implement tax reform such that the top  pay their share of taxes.  Currently very wealthy people pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than you do.  This happens for a couple of reasons.  One reason is because those people can hire very expensive and very talented accountants and lawyers to find and take advantage of every possible tax law and loophole.  They have forgotten more about our tax code than you or I will ever learn.The other problem is that in this country we have attempted to implement in practice this theory of trickle down economics.  The theory is that if you offer tax incentives and cuts to corporations and to the very wealthy they will reinvest those tax savings into human and material assets and thereby grow the economy.The problem with this theory is once again human greed.  This theory when put into practice has been proven time and again to not incentivize increased employment and reinvestment.  It has been used to increase corporate capital and executive bonuses which then make their way to as you point out tax safe havens.So the end result is that the rich pay proportionately less taxes than the poor and instead of employing the poor to grow the economy they just get richer and richer.So if this doesnt work then why does it keep happening?  Because the wealthy top  and the powerful corporations with executives who benefit from this theory are the ones who fund the political campaigns.

The point is that just because something is behaving does not mean it is sentient. Plants do not have central nervous systems. They do not experience pain or suffer subjectively.This is a capability they developed all on their own. Without programming or instruction they created these networks to share resources to benefit the survival of the ecosystem. Now evolutionary adaptations certainly arent all the result of intentional actions by a certain organism but the ability to adapt without programming indicates to me that comparing them to computers is wholly inaccurate. gtPlants do not have central nervous systems. Neither do  of animal species. CNS is unique to vertebrates. Plants do have a system that responds to environmental stimuli and  processes that information. This is both within individual plants and as demonstrated in the article I linked between plants even plants of different species. That is a type of sophistication even many animal species lack. While science isnt certain on whether or not the concept of pain can adequately describe any experience of any plants they can feel pressure temperature and so on.

We already live in a society where fat people are ostracized because they arent co side red typically beautiful now you want to ostracize them because they may have unhealthy eating habits but could also have several medical conditions that make gaining weight very easy. ,TMBR,dex6jyz,2,t5_2r99c

11263928,0,t1_df8puay,!DisagreeWithOPMy main disagreement with your statement is the fact that I dont think anyone should have to pay for healthcare in the first place. There are so many countries that have inclusive healthcare systems that it proves it can be done sustainably and fairly.But that aside I really dont understand your reasoning here.  if you make that exception wouldnt everyone with an illness claim that his illness is the result of a bad luck? Sure they could but that doesnt mean the people that make the decisions have to believe them. Someone who has a hereditary cancer clearly is coming from a different situation from someone who smokes for  years and develops throat cancer or some who drinkdrives and is injured. Also in an emergency situation are you really expecting doctors to source payment or proof that payment can be made before saving a life?,TMBR,df8r085,7,t5_2r99c

11337701,0,t1_dffk9wk,This is a debate convincing me of something is part of the territory. Im more than open to evolution being true as it doesnt conflict with any predetermined view of reality that i have. That article explains how Epigenetics can be caused by RNA which is less random than genes poofing themselves into existence and into sequence. Random mutationsnatural selection makes no sense but this article doesnt stray far from Random. Before you can play the game of mutating for the benefit of evolution there has to be enough information to work with. Sure you can get the word eye if you jumble around letters of the alphabet. But if you are missing the letters e and y youre never going to get eye as a result. No matter how much you reorganize an alphabet without the letters e and y e and y arent going to emerge. ,TMBR,dfh3xae,1,t5_2r99c

You only end up with the extremes giving the perception of the idea of forcing them but of course the extremes are always most vocal. The same case can be made for just about anything. Do most parents plan to disown you if youre gay? No. But do people get that perception because of vocal extremes? Yes. ,TMBR,dfunkz0,5,t5_2r99c

11591303,0,t1_dg9qb4s,Additionally its hard to prove the validity of something that means quite a few different things for everyone. Example For thirdcountry women feminism is more about fulfilment of human rights for all people eg universal suffrage and education and from a legal standpoint it is greatly difficult for firstworld women in different countries to promote and enforce the protection of the human rights of women because of state sovereignty. When you take this into consideration its hard to say what you can do for thirdworld women outside of putting public pressure on governments to change which can only do so much and which can also be dismissed. Not sure if it wouldve been more appropriate to reply to the original post just wanted to say that I agreed with your comment. Theres a lot of fairly condescending language in this thread and the length of OPs replies suggest theyre more here to flex their debating muscles than to be open to hearing other peoples perceptions of feminism and why it is in fact important. ,TMBR,dg9vrxs,2,t5_2r99c
