2824397,0,t3_2sfkrz,You will want to tell your student mentor when you start that you have been working on your CCNA and your Net  dont lie though actually start working on them now. Most likely they will ask you to complete a couple classes first to show that you are competent and that you will be successful. I usually ask students in this situation to do IT fundamentals  and your A courses first and as long as you complete them successfully Im likely to have you start working on Net  and then Security  and the CCNA courses. Most of the students that take this route with me are working on their CCNA in their second term.The reason I do this with my students is because  of my new Security students tell me that they are ready to take the CCNA right away. Maybe a quarter of them actually are and in that situation they typically finish those fundamentals courses within a couple months of starting and can move on. The others really werent ready and often struggle to finish the fundamentals courses we set up as a compromise. I never want to put students in a situation where the most likely outcome is failure. Not every student mentor operates the same way. Some will just enroll you in the CCNA courses up front no questions asked some will say no you have to follow the standard path no exceptions. Most of the best mentors the ones with the highest graduation rates follow an in between approach.As for your original question if you earn a certification on your own dime outside of WGU then there is a process for getting them applied as transfer credit you will need to work with your student mentor on that. It is lengthy and it can be denied if its not the exact same test you would take through WGU. ,WGU,cnp4mcc,6,t5_2se63

3013493,0,t1_coa14tm,Please tell me the difference between the following two scenarios. You take one course at a traditional school.  You do not go to any of the lectures and spend three days before the final studying and you pass the final which makes up  of your grade.. You take one course at WGU and pass within three daysThe difference is that in the first case you waste four months of your time for no good reason.  The material is about the same.I went to George Mason for two years before coming to WGU majoring in Bioengineering.  I doubt I spent more than  hours on any one course actually learning the material this isnt counting all the time wasted on petty assignments and classwork.  When I wanted to switch majors they told me it would take  years... fuck that.I mean break things down your average undergrad textbook has about  chapters.  If you are efficient at study you can cover the relevant material in a chapter in about  hours.  Undergraduate material is not hard.   chapters   hrschapter   hrs  about  days at  hrsday.  You should not need more time than that.  Say you arent so good at study and it takes you  hrschapter.  Thats still about two weeks per class if you treat it like a full time job.  I dont understand how it could take you more time unless you procrastinate and thats a reflection of you not the school. Not to mention that in many classes at traditional schools you do not even need to cover the material so thoroughly professors give you all sorts of projects and papers and sometimes homework I hoped that sort of thing would stop after high school but it didnt in my experience just doing a good job on these things can allow you to pass the class with a lessthanstellar final.  And dont tell me youve never passed a test you didnt study for thorough study is only required for difficult courses even at traditional schools.There is no good reason it should take four years to get a degree.,WGU,coachwz,3,t5_2se63

3315989,0,t3_2y3cj0,The first question is brilliant. I dont think you could encapsulate an idea so clearlyOverall how well does WGU do at communicating with you about the things you need to know to be a successful student? Communicates with me too frequently. Communicates with me too infrequently. Communicates too much irrelevant information to me. Undercommunicates important information to me. Communicates with me in confusing complicated or hardtounderstand ways. Communicates mixed messages or information that contradicts other communication I have received.

That said I know of other WGU students within the company I work at and they are relatively high profile and have indicated they have never had issues with their degree. It is a wellrespected school because it is regionally accredited. It is not a degree mill and its not a for profit school like UoP is.  It still flies under the radar a lot because there hasnt been bad press like UoP or many other online schools and so a lot of people dont know of it. Ive been happy with the education Ive received so far and think that its as good of quality as anywhere. The difference is that Im learning at MY PACE and learning the way I learn best instead of someone else dictating when I go to school what I must do to learn etc. Im not a fan at all of traditional collegebeen there done that and had the debt to prove it.

5261905,0,t1_cvk919e,Woah woah woah first off all slow down and take a big deep breath. There are tons of .NET  C jobs all around the country. Some of them will require you to know databases others will want you to be really good with frontend technologies e.g. JavaScript  its libraries TypeScript etc. It really just depends on what the company needs in that particular role. The best way to get a hold on the technologies IMO is to study for the developer certification tests. Since youre dead set on going into the Microsoft stack why double down and learn then relearn technologies? I guarantee you that honestly earning the MCSD will give you the indepth jump start you need to get started as a developer in a particular track SharePoint Azure Web Dev etc. Im working on my MCSD for SharePoint apps since I already have my MCSE MCSA and MCITP. Studying for the exams has given me a more structured learning environment. Microsoft exam books if you search the name and .pdf are pretty much all available to find online.  While I have a lot of practical application building SharePoint apps there are a lot of little qwerks here and there that Ive never had to touch because of client needs. Studying for these exams forces me to look at those parts of development that Im not exposed to in my regular daytoday work.How far along are you in your degree? The Data Management foundations applications and for programmers courses give you a very indepth look at SQL databases Istructure syntax hashing indexing etc. This knowledgepractice is more than enough to get you where you need to be with databases. Because they teach using SQL it will directly translate when you work with SQL servers. Just knowing how to use the Entity framework or .NET doesnt really help if you dont have an understanding of data structures and algorithms. Sure youll be able to make a couple of cool simple MVC apps but that knowledge can only take you so far. When you want to work in a complex production environment the info youll pickup in your Data Structures course will certainly come in handy and even help you if you get asked those sorts of questions in interviews. Have you played around with Azure at all yet? Azure for web development is completely free for students. Azure is really where Microsoft is pushing for all of its development to go. I mean SharePoint  has less features than its online component and onpremise PowerBI doesnt have  of the features that make it a valuable BI tool. Anywho checkout the  exam. I really do recommend getting a very solid grasp on the fundamentals HTML CSS JS first the WGU intro to web development course lacks in this area.by honest I mean do NOT use exam dumps. Study for the exam and pass it on your own.,WGU,cvk9lvv,1,t5_2se63

6213290,0,t1_cyvi6ek,I havent taken or studied for the CCNA Security so I cant offer any advice on that but for CCNA the advice Id give you is. Take the two test route if WGU allows...Im not sure of their rules for this but with this certification you can take  separate tests ICND and ICND to get the CCNA. ICND gives you the CCENT then you pass the other part for CCNA. You can also take an exam that combines them both for the CCNA. . Watch the CBT Nuggets series with Jeremy Cioara. Also download Packet Tracer and try to set up networks of your own and follow along with the videos. The CBT Nuggets Exam Walkthrough with Kyle Barker will kind of show you the types of questions to expect on the exam. . Use the CCNA subreddit rCCNA look at the top posts of all time search for keywords you arent sure about. There is lots of good advice there.. Before your exam they will give you a laminated sheet and a marker. Memorize a good subnetting graph you can find on the internet. Before your test you get  minutes to do an exam tutorial use this time to write down your subnetting chart on your laminated sheet. Also use subnetting.net and do their subnetting questions.

The class gets exponentially more difficult once you get to sections  and if you dont have a solid foundation from the previous lessons it will look like gibberish. For the concepts that were most challenging I worked extra problem on khanacademy.com. Also when I finally took the OA before I even started the first problem I wrote down equations I needed to remember on my white board so that I could reference them during the test  for example rate x distance  timeThe OA has significantly more word problems than the pre assessment so be prepared for that.

Find projects to work on that will force you to solve problems and troubleshoot.  Debugging is huge as well.  If you can debug well you will be much more valuable to employers.  I know people that are programmers that never got degrees but they learned their craft well and can prove it.  Ultimately the degree is valuable because it gets your resume looked at more often where some HR reps might just send it straight to the round file.

10169248,0,t1_dbwcdek, for all this. Im going to WGU for the HR tickbox but the general worry is views like the IT director you mentioned. Its subjective for each place you apply to so the best bet if possible is get your B.S from WGU but get a MS from someplace else more wellknown and respected. Thats my plan anyway. to get the B.S done at WGU then apply at either Stanford or NC Stateleaning toward NC State since i went there before and i live nearby for masters programs there... They both have really attractive online options. The one real big downside to taking this path is that you will be stuck doing a lot of prerequisites for example at NC State you need some highlevel math classes and a decent GRE score to get accepted. ,WGU,dbwqnmh,2,t5_2se63

By the end it was one at a time as it required my total attention to complete each of the toughest courses  managerial accounting  finance  and the captsone specifically. It did help that I set goals. I had a mini calendar which originally planned for me finishing the entire program in   years and each course designated a number of weeks as a goal and stretch goal based on perceived difficulty. As I continued to meet my stretch goals I was able to move the completion of my program ahead more and more until  year completion was a possibility which really motivated me till the end. I would certainly advise anyone who might be starting out the program with wishful thoughts of giving every single class their all to at least test out of those beginner gen eds ASAP. I spent an entire week on Organizational Behavior which covers topics I already knew thoroughly from experience. I took the PA cold on day  and scored in the high s. I clearly knew the subject matter and could have tested out that day. That week I spend watching videos which were great BTW I could have been focusing on my next course.  Thats not to say one should strive for the bare minimum  I dont think I scored below a  and most were in the upper s despite all cut scores being lt just dont waste time on the first several beginner courses if you know them your study time is much better spent on the real meat and potatoes courses.,WGU,dceici2,1,t5_2se63

10363437,0,t1_dchmtcj,mustardketchupI think adding a MBA to your product management experience makes great sense more so than me seeking a MSIS! I am basing my perspective off of my experience working in sales for Qualcomm in the early s. Product people with business skills and a mindset of servicing the client not just marching to orders presented in the product road map were invaluable back then Im sure they are even more valuable to toptier organizations today.You are already in tech Im trying to make a career switch back to it.
