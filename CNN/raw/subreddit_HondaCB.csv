2579666,0,t1_cmva73t,I personally wouldnt buy Gazelles for a motorcycle nor would I get the same size for both wheels. Shinko  is a surprisingly excellent tire at a low price for that bike and the tread looks decent. More expensive alternates are Avon RoadRiders for arguably better handling or IRC GSs for a more accurate vintage tread pattern.No love for the side covers or you just want them black? I like the top scheme a little better the bottom schemes top color looks a lot like the stock pale blue some early CBs used. Or maybe Ive just seen it on several cafe projects.I commend you for replacing the cables and especially the front brake cable. You listed two of those I assume youre only buying one.One big question though did someone smash the original carbs with a hammer? Because if they didnt theres probably nothing wrong with them and you wont have to screw with them sixteen times to get the jetting sorted out since Honda did the work for you on that in the s. Better yet you can operate the choke on both carbs with just your left hand whereas the Mikunis will require you to screw around with both hands and theyre not especially ergonomic to operate even when youre parked.Oh and if you keep the original carbs Motion Pro makes a nice replacement throttle cable youll want to get.,HondaCB,cmvat8h,3,t5_2udhl

4128337,0,t1_crqtx9u,no. powdercoat is not for internal parts.its like paint but WAY more durable. not too expensive if your doing basic black.youd send the frame out steel parts like footpeg and engine brackets swingarm fork lowers maybe the rims if you dont want to rechrome them its priceyas for zinc you could find a local plater. remove every steel nut and bolt and zinc part from the bike send to the plater. should be like  bucks and a few weeks and they come back looking like new.  its cheaper than trying to replace bolts and being left with rusty ones.   Zinc is the coating that goes on from the factory to keep it from rusting. it wears away after  years and usually the part is still in good shape just surface rust. get it rezinced and youll be good for another .  little details like this are what separate professionally restored bikes from garage jobs.  its the attention to detail not so much the money involved. because what you GET vs what you pay to have everything zinced its worth it every time.,HondaCB,crqus54,1,t5_2udhl

4980584,0,t3_3j4gmq,High weight oil does reduce power slightly which is why some cars use w oil these days even though w oil isnt cheap and it isnt as easy to make a longlasting engine designed for it. But if your engine is running hot because of your hot climate then w should behave very similar to the lighter oil probably w should have behaved. Even though you may notice reduced power compared to the lighter oil this should be how your engine wants to operate.

7667937,0,t1_d3ds3gu,Very thorough and helpful! Thank you uSplazoid ! If I am understanding correctly the best I can hope for when tracking the lineage of my particular bike is to determine that the frame and engine are the same year and beyond that its guesswork? ,HondaCB,d3dstyv,2,t5_2udhl

7912783,0,t3_4nlv3d,Price guides are useless. Market value is quite different than a book. NADA puts a  CB Sandcast up to  k. Youd be hard pressed to find an excellent one under k...  for a CBK is a normal asking price from a dealer but they will certainly take less. Bikes which have already been serviced are worth considerably more than bikes with unaddressed issues. If youre the type of guy who will fix everything up yourself buy more of a project. If you dont want to get in over your head and prefer to buy more of a roadready bike then you need to pay the guy who made it that way.With that said Ive got a lot of vintage cycles for sale  what are you after and whats your budget?,HondaCB,d45gzjb,3,t5_2udhl

8326265,0,t3_4t62pg,People on this subreddit REALLY dont like pods. And yeah theyre right but theyre pretty unhelpful sometimes because of it.I run pods on my cb and yeah it burbles a little at low RPM. Not a disaster.Anyway theyre not lying to you when they say theres no easy way to pick the right jet sizes. Just gotta size up and see what happens. Run it and check the spark plugs. If theyre black too rich if theyre white too lean if theyre coffeecolored just about right.It sounds like youre probably lean at the moment. If theyre not too expensive you should probably get the next two sizes up for main jets and try each of them. Or better yet if they come in a kit thats ideal.And your idle problem might well be the pilot jets. So probably get a larger one of those as well. Idk if your specific carbs have idle adjustments but thatd be important to mess with too.Listen to the haters but ultimately do what you want.,HondaCB,d5ic6eg,2,t5_2udhl

9271638,0,t3_57dtcq,Have a cl and just replaced my stator which fixed all these problems. Was chasing this issue for months and replaced the rectifier battery fuses blinkers. Pretty much a whole electrical system. There are YouTube videos on testing stators to see if theyre bad or not but its definitely your stator,HondaCB,d8r8wgb,1,t5_2udhl
9455581,0,t3_5a8hzu,Glad to help.The voltage goes from the points and then to the coils. So if youre not getting voltage to the points then begin there. Check the yellow and blue wires which go into the points and see if you have the voltage and if so doublecheck your point gaps. There are a lot of components in the ignition side of things but theyre all quite simple and easy to adjust. Its quite likely that you simply need to adjust what you already have. If you need to replace a wire theres no need to go to a place like into etc. Just go to the hardware store and buy some awg wire in your color of choice. ,HondaCB,d9ek8ue,1,t5_2udhl

9489961,0,t1_d9isv7x,I wouldnt tear down the bike with all that work hes done to it. You will just need to take off the carbs super simple but...Jetting is probably the worst thing I have ever done. It requires many sets of spark plugs and you have to take apart the carbs each time take out all the little parts and replace the jets. Then you run the bike for a little bit getting up to speed. If it runs like poop then you repeat everything over. It could take you  or  times to even get a good jet combo.With these bikes people replace them with pod filters and add non stock pipes. That greatly affects the running quality of the bike as they were designed to use the stock airbox.The original carbs are vacuum  the mikunis are slide which is more responsive.,HondaCB,d9iu9uc,2,t5_2udhl

Im inexperienced so working on the finnicky bits of the bike makes me nervous. I wanna know exactly what I should be doing.
