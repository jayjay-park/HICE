5444068,0,t3_3pjn6f,This is a good effort and a needed effort but I see one thing that absolutely has to be addressedSection  gives the Governor unlimited power to issue Executive Orders with the approval of the Supreme CourtThe issue I have with this is that the scope of Executive orders arent limited  the SCs only responsibility is to determine if an order bill or action is unconstitutional.  This constitution makes it possible for the Governor to order a raise in taxes order a higher pay for himself and the legislature or order a change to the election process.  As I suggested in a comment on the previous proposed constitutions thread it would be a better idea to specify that the governor can only give orders to public employees and these orders can only stand for a specified amount of time before having to go before the legislature and become a bill with  votes  days seems like a good idea.Also stipulate that an executive order can be challenged by the legislature immediately and if more than    vote of the legislature votes against it it will be struck down.  Still keep the Supreme Court challenge but add a legislative challenge.  Executive power cannot be unlimited.  ,ModelSouthernState,cw7j63v,2,t5_37x1y
5687160,0,t1_cx210fs,From a Florida Court CasegtSince the House of Representatives is clothed with the sole power of impeachment it necessarily follows that it has the power to determine whether the charges brought against one amount to a misdemeanor in office as contemplated by the Constitution.andgtMisdemeanor in office as ground for impeachment has a much broader coverage than the common law misdemeanor as usually defined and applied in criminal procedure. As applied to impeachment  misdemeanor in office may include any act involving moral turpitude which is contrary to justice honesty principles or good morals if performed by virtue or authority of office. Misdemeanor in office is synonymous with misconduct in office and is broad enough to embrace any wilful malfeasance misfeasance or nonfeasance in office. It may not necessarily imply corruption or criminal intent. Another casegtThe determination of what is an impeachable offense is the responsibility of the legislature,ModelSouthernState,cx21pqk,3,t5_37x1y

I think this is partisan and personal.Its me urging the legislators to reject an unqualified and immature person to their court.gtNah reddit only pings . If you want some more sevag panzer johker kai yu nate yugo amusei eduardo logan ross... the list stretches on and on. Im not sayign everyone loves me Im just saying I didnt cherry pick . I have plenty of friends in this sim and plenty of people who respect me even if were not friends.Ever wonder what people say when youre not around?Heres an example. I played it civil and professional when you were on DLP leadership but didnt rave about you outside it.Remember this?Or your short lived deputy chair campaign?gtMe neither. You have attacked my party so many times that it doesnt even surprise me anymore. I have never in my recollection just started attacking the dlp out of the blue without someone attacking me or my party. I cant say the same for you.Lol complete nonsense. Youve accused me of banning people for wanting to leave the party out of nowhere actually on the Join a Party thread. Youve insulted our member as A German who doesnt know anything about law. gtNo Ive made tons of mistakes. Being a member of the DLP is one of them Letting you in was a mistake on my end I must admit.gtPushing to get a central state supreme court doesnt count?? Furthermore Id like to know where I ever said I was entitled to a court position before I was given it.No it matters as much as your guaranteed senate seat. Maybe the fact youre already talking about creating a skype chat with the other justices shows youre cocky about your confirmation. gtNo you dont but I dont care to waste my time or energy arguing with you. I will be ignoring anyall response to this.Fair enough.With this said I encourage this honorable legislature to vote down this confirmation. Not to take away from the other two candidates who are very well qualified and deserve yea votes.,ModelSouthernState,cx6gkse,2,t5_37x1y

While education is of utmost importance it is far more important to not create a tidal wave of debt for our citizens seeking education. I agree with you wholeheartedly.

7245132,0,t1_d20728s,Growing up in Georgia agriculture is something that has always been very important to me.  My neighbors are farmers. My family are farmers. My family and friends work in processing plants and are truck drivers moving the product from production points to store shelves. Ive always seen the effect the government can have on this process and the importance.  In some ways government can make it much more efficient and in other ways government can also make it equally difficult for them to get the job done. Receiving education at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton Georgia allowed me to supplant my hands on knowledge of the industry with some hands off knowledge including further education in jobs in the industry laws and regulations and seeing how it all comes together. When I lost my run for lieutenant governor of the northeast state I returned home and knew it was fine for me to run for secretary of agriculture and help and support an industry I love and hold dear to my heart.  There is no candidate out there more qualified. Please vote yes for Russsty ,ModelSouthernState,d21pwve,1,t5_37x1y

The United States offers so much to Southern state and we have an unbreakable bond. We are Americans. We make the nation stronger and the nation makes us stronger.
