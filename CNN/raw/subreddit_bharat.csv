6002964,0,t1_cy6io8s,Part From centrifuges to submarinesSerena KelleherVergantini an analyst at the Institute for Science and International Security a Washingtonbased nonprofit scoured all the available satellite imagery in the summer of . Eventually she zeroed in on the construction site in the kavals. The journal IHS Janes Intelligence Review was separately doing the same in London commissioning Kelley formerly of the IAEA to analyze images from the Mysore plant.What struck both of them was the enormous scale and ambition of the projects as well as the secrecy surrounding them. The militarynuclear park in the kavals at nearly  square miles has a footprint comparable in size to the New York state capital Albany. After analyzing the images and conducting interviews with atomic officials in India KelleherVergantini concluded that the footprint for enrichment facilities planned in the new complex would enable scientists to produce industrial quantities of uranium though the institute would only know how much when construction had progressed further. As Kelley examined photos of the second site he was astonished by the presence of two recently expanded buildings that had been made lofty enough to accommodate a new generation of tall carbonfiber centrifuges capable of working far faster to enrich uranium than any existing versions.Nuclear experts express the productiveness of the enrichment machines in Separative Work Units SWUs. Kelley concluded that at the second site the government could install up to  of these new hyperefficient machines which together with about  older centrifuges could complete  SWUs a year  enough he said to make roughly  pounds of weaponsgrade uranium. A new hydrogen bomb with an explosive force exceeding  tons of TNT requires only between roughly  and  pounds of enriched uranium according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials a group of nuclear experts from  countries that seek to reduce and secure uranium stocks.Retired Indian nuclear scientists and military officers said in interviews that Indias growing nuclear submarine fleet would be the first beneficiary of the newly produced enriched uranium.India presently has just one indigenous vessel the INS Arihant constructed in a program supervised by the prime ministers office. Powered by an megawatt uranium reactor developed by BARC that began operating in August  it will formally enter military service in  having undergone sea trials in . A second INS Aridhaman is already under construction with at least two more slated to be built a senior military officer said in an interview. Each would be loaded with up to  nucleartipped missiles. The officer who was not authorized to be named said the fleets expansion gained a new sense of urgency after Chinese submarines sailed across the Bay of Bengal to Sri Lanka in September and October  docking in a port facility in Colombo that had been built by Chinese engineers.Asked what else the additional uranium would be used for a senior scientist at the DRDO who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it would mostly be used to fuel civilian nuclear power reactors and contribute to what he called benign medical and scientific programs. The government has not made such a promise publicly however or provided details. India does not have to report what it does with its indigenous uranium especially if it is not in the civilian domain said Sunil Chirayath a research assistant professor at Texas AampM University who is an expert on Indias civilian nuclear program.A senior Obama administration official in Washington who was not authorized to be quoted by name expressed skepticism about the government scientists private claim. The official said that Indias civilian nuclear programs including power stations and research establishments were actually benefiting from new access to imported nuclear fuel after the embargos removal in  and now require almost no homemade enriched uranium.India has already received roughly  tons of uranium from France Russia and Kazakhstan for example and it has agreements with Canada Mongolia Argentina and Namibia for additional shipments. In September  thenPrime Minister Tony Abbott signed an agreement to make Australia a longterm reliable supplier of uranium to India  a deal that has sparked considerable controversy at home.The International Panel on Fissile Materials estimates that the Arihantclass submarine core requires only about  pounds of uranium enriched to  percent  a measure of how many of its isotopes can be readily used in weaponry. Using this figure and the estimated capacity of the centrifuges India is installing in Mysore alone  not even including Challakere  Kelley concluded that even after fueling its entire submarine fleet there would be  pounds of weaponsgrade uranium left over every year or enough to fuel at least  Hbombs. His calculation presumes that the plant is run efficiently and that its excess capacity is purposeful and not driven by bureaucratic inertia  two large uncertainties in India a senior U.S. official noted. But having a rainy day stockpile to deter the Chinese might be the aim the official added.Thermonuclear doctrine and the China threatA retired official who served inside the nuclear cell at the Indian prime ministers office the apex organization that supervises the military nuclear program conceded that other uses besides submarines had been anticipated for many years. He pointed to a thermonuclear bomb program as a beneficiary and suggested India had had no choice but to develop a new generation of more powerful megaton weapons if it was to maintain credible minimum deterrence.Previously this meant the bare minimum required to prevent an attack on India but a new Indian doctrine in   in response to Pakistans increasingly aggressive nuclear posture  altered this notion Nuclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage. China the retired official said has long had a thermonuclear capability and if India is to have a strategic defense worth its salt and become a credible power in the region we need to develop a similar weapon and in deployable numbers. U.S. and British officials affirmed that they have been aware of this discussion among Indian scientists and soldiers for years.In an interview Gen. Balraj Singh Nagal who from  to  ran Indias Strategic Forces Command within its Nuclear Command Authority the group that manages Indias nuclear forces declined to discuss specific aspects of the nuclear city in Challakere or the transformation of the Rare Materials Plant close to Mysore. But keeping pace with China and developing a meaningful counter to its arsenal was the most pressing issue facing India he said.Its not Pakistan we are looking at most of the time like most in the West presume Nagal said. Beijing has long managed a thermonuclear program and so this is one of many options India should push forward with as well as reconsidering our nuclear defense posture which is outdated and ineffective. We have to follow the technological curve. And where China took it several decades before us with the hydrogen bomb India has to follow.The impact of the U.S.India nuclear deal and Indias fissile production surge on the countrys neighbors can already be seen. Pakistan recently stepped up a gear the former senior British official said. He pointed to an increase in Pakistans plutonium production at four new military reactors in the city of Khushab a reprocessing plant known as Pinstech near Islamabad a refurbished civilian plutonium reprocessing plant converted to military use in an area known as Chashma and the ramping up of uranium production at a site in Dera Ghazi Khan.The retired British official added India needs to constantly rethink what deterrence means as it is not a static notion and everyone understands that. But the balance of power in the region is so easily upset. The official said that in choosing to remain publicly silent the United States was taking a risk evidently to try and reap financial and strategic rewards.,bharat,cy6iojr,3,t5_2qyh9
