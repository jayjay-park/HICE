2756653,0,t1_cnhevgp,Yeah just the history the dude has is awesome. I love when he gets with Damon Albarn and plays Tender with Blur mad he didnt do that at Coachella . Blur was one of my top acts in  next to Chili Peppers. Mad He didnt come back with his Solo stuff at Coachella last year or I wouldve went because I lived down there. But he played Governors Ball instead.,governorsball,cnhf4u3,1,t5_2w5mj
2757777,0,t1_cnhizp5,gt And Im sure youll have fun at Coachella even if the line up isnt as good as last years!Yeah absolutely I live in DC now so really its the only time I can see my old Cali friends hahaIf Bonnaroos lineup is half as good as it was last year I honestly think it will easily take the top festival of  crown.. My ONLY problem with Roo is that it is logistically hard to get to regardless of where youre coming from unless you live in TN. My girlfriend is originally from Chicago so I might check out Lolla this year as Ive never been and she knows plenty of people who go every year plus they have a flash sale for  day passes for  in March haha.,governorsball,cnhjqz0,2,t5_2w5mj
2893751,0,t3_2t71fz,You can figure out a pretty good amount from the tour dates of each act.  Like with The Black Keys  for instance theyre also playing Mountain Jam that weekend which theyve been confirmed as the Saturday headliner for and their website says Sunday.Also according to Lana Del Reys website shes playing Sunday The one other act I saw anything helpful for is Noel Gallagher  whose playing a show in DC that Thursday and Boston that Saturday with Sunday listed as the day hes playing gov ball.  This of course is taking into account that bands could arbitrarily pick a day to list theyd most often do that by listing the first day of the festival.   ,governorsball,cnx0un4,1,t5_2w5mj

7375128,0,t3_4g0l84,Check your email confirmation from Stubhub. There is a deliver by date indicating when youll receive your wristband. The seller does not get paid until you receive your wristband so theyre incentivized to deliver it to you ASAP. In practice youll receive an email from Stubhub once your tickets have shipped along with a tracking number. I believe the absolute latest day for delivery of the wristbands is on June . If you dont have it before you leave Stubhub will make good on the purchase and provide you with wristbands from their own stock contact them and theyll work it our for you.

And for people like me yeah it would have been worth it to go for just an afternoon.  Randalls island is a nightmare to get to and from and they just proved that they cant keep people that many people safe on the grounds.  So I respect that they did the responsible thing and cancelled but Im still pissed and it turned out to be beautiful day.  Its just poor foresight IMO.  ,governorsball,d3y2mq2,1,t5_2w5mj
