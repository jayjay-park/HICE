696247,0,t3_224uav,I used my rebate this year to help me save up for the downpayment of a house. Im still paying off student loans and used this rebate last year to bring the amount down.Its very disappointing that future graduates wont have that money to offset their student loans and help them start a life here. It was a fantastic way to keep young people in the province and I often used it as an example for why someone should live here!I feel this decision came with very little thought towards the longterm future.

7593480,0,t3_4jbnii,Well you have four main mobile companies.Rogers Telus Bell and Eastlink. Eastlink is kinda new but you can bundle it with their internetcableland line. I have a bundle with them for cableinternetlandline. I didnt get their cell service though with bell as I travel a lot around Canada and the USA and as theyre new to cell service I just dont really have confidence in them to not charge me up the ass. My parents do have their cell service and theyre quite happy. If youre just sticking around NS its fine not to say you cant travel... But I do like that bell offers a USA package that I use. Did t really look into what eastlink had for that.As for Internet as I said I have eastlink and Im happy with them... But it really depends are where you are in NS. If youre in the HRM eastlink is available almost everywhere. BellAliant is the other ISP and theyre quite good. They have fibreOP available lots of places now and in my opinion its pretty kick ass and they have the edge on eastlink in my opinion. Some places dont have fibreOP and theyre offering DSL. Get eastlink for sure if thats the case.If youre out in the boonies and have no access to cableDSLfibre then your only option is wind and its a wirelessly supplied radio Internet and its crap. So good luck.Bottom line. Just pick a package with cellISP that works for you theyre all going to screw you some how. BellTelus has the best coverage in NS so that might be a factor for youGood luck.,NovaScotia,d35c9o2,5,t5_2qtnx
