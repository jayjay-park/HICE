1724020,0,t1_cjwgkp7,Oh it can make me grumpy too. But I usually try to frame it to myself as someone using physics as a parable the physics is not the important part for them theyre trying to find an analogy to communicate their own ideas better. I also wouldnt get mad at a Catholic priest talking about shepherds even if he didnt know much about them.It can be a subtle line to play next to though since its easy for you to start saying Look! Physics has proved my spiritual beliefs correct! or Those physicists have no idea what theyre actually doing! And even if you dont say that someone listening to the sermon who isnt as careful as you are might think that youre saying that anyway. Its definitely not something I would suggest doing.,HeKnowsQuantumPhysics,cjwh6o5,2,t5_32m6z
4180793,0,t1_crw3idy,gt What this implies in simple terms is that without an observer the electron doesnt actually exist. Its just the probability of an electron. Since we have physical bodies wed need an infinite regression of observers breaking down the wave function. If we take this back to the Big Bang we have ONE observer that broke down the first wave function creating matter.QQ,HeKnowsQuantumPhysics,crwtbgv,3,t5_32m6z
