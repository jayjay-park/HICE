9570,0,t1_ceeop2a,I have quite a few break cues but I wouldnt necessarily agree with this post. There are a ton of pros that break with their playing cue. I do on bar box tables. Most custom makers will tell you that a cue is made for playing and breaking. The biggest worry is either mushrooming the tip or breaking a ferrule ivory. Usually you will be just fine without a break cue. I break with my playing cue often and hit quite hard. Never really had an issue. I do have to unmushroom a tip every now and again but that is super easy.,billiards,cefiwoo,3,t5_2r9yh

30277,0,t3_1uga70,Check online to see if Poison shares weight bolts with another brand. Often those cheaper cues are just rebranded and slightly down graded versions of more well known cues. For example Players cues are basically cheapified Lucasi cues and hence use the same weight bolts. Once you know what the original brand is you should be able to find the weight bolts easily on sites such as seyberts.com or pooldawg.com.With that said dont order replacement bolts until you have removed the existing one if there is one. Some brands are notorious for having extremely tight bolts such as Viper and Action. Those can be nearly impossible to remove without possibly damaging the cues themselves.,billiards,cehvnof,2,t5_2r9yh

69010,0,t3_1uw6ib,I really dont thinks it is that bad.  You are most likely going to refelt it when you set it back up.  My table has two different colors for the rails and bed but they are just different shades of blue.  I think mine actually looks fine but i will definetly have a single color when i refelt it and and change the rails soon hopefully.  What really kills me though  i was watching an episode of bar rescue where they were upgrading an old pool hall.  They purposely made a two tone pool table to make them pop i thinks was the term they used.  The colors were red and black if i remember correctly.  Absolutely terrible for a professional pool hall.,billiards,cemaay7,3,t5_2r9yh

No offense at all to Earl or Efren or Francisco or any of the older great players but when documentaries and tv specials come up we need people like Shane to step forward.  Look at the game of golf.  Every few years golf puts its current next big thing on the front lines of its PR campaigns.

A lot of people moved over to Fast Eddies on Wednesdays because the guy running our league was a prick. I hear thats a pretty fun league. First Break has the truest tables you will find in the area though. Typically a pool hall will have something where you can fill out your information and team captains who are looking for players will contact you. Just ask the bartender or something if you dont see the APA box there. Next season begins at the end of April or beginning of May cant remember. My team at First Break will actually be looking for a lower level player because were very top heavy. Its a very good team going to the Vegas qualifiers and they taught me pretty much everything I know.

Make sure youre using a good break ball to start off and the more you practice it the better your break balls will be from the start youll get a better spread and not a ton of clusters consistently and have a higher percentage of getting through that first rack and picking a good pattern at the end of the rack to set yourself up for a nice break ball.Keep on keepin on is what Im saying.,billiards,cqksr9e,3,t5_2r9yh
3759535,0,t1_cqkli0e,Based on your statement I am going to guess you are much younger than me.  Now I am by no means an old geezer but I have loved pool for what I am guessing is as many years as you have been on this planet.Back in my early s I only had one option for watching pool matches on TV and that was ESPN.  I have a box filled to the brim of ESPN pool matches on VHS   Yeah I just linked a Wiki for you just in case.  Now you know as well as I do that pool doesnt get the recognition it deserves.  So the marketing team over at ESPN decided they needed something flashy that will draw in a bigger pool crowd and that was Trick Shot Magic.  Dont get me wrong these guys are still fantastic pool players. Mike Massey Tom Rossman Andy Segal.  They can all give any pool player a run for their money.  Now you have Venom all over the web doing his thing.  But if it brings more fans than it is what it is.So for that I respect it.  but.....trick shots are not real pool.

3821228,0,t3_346som,It depends on how much money youre willing to spend.You could blow  on a shiny new Predator BKIII or you could repurpose an old cue that you have lying around.Realistically I doubt you want to break the bank on your first break cue. You can probably pick something up around the  mark that will work just fine.Conventional wisdom as I understand it is that light is better  oz. and gives you more control. More weight supposedly doesnt actually help you break any harder or faster. For the most part though its a question of what feels good for you.The advice regarding phenolic tips is sound. Its kind of difficult to find a break cue that ships with anything but phenolic but there are leather tips that are said to be as hard as phenolic e.g. Samsara and hybrid leatherphenolic tips e.g. Tiger Icebreaker out there that may be worth researching.So what is it you like about your teammates cues and do you know specifically what they have?I always used a house cue to break or borrowed one until I first played in a tournament where there were none. Now I use my old Fury playing cue with a water buffalo leather tip on it. Gets the job done.Edit clarification on weight,billiards,cqruo97,1,t5_2r9yh

4102181,0,t1_crnufiw,To my understanding you can grab the cue when its ball in hand. She had ball in hand and I was showing her where to put it and why. I see other captains doing it and it isnt and wasnt the problem. The issue was that I was holding the cue ball and with my other hand touched another ball. They made it seem as though it would have been ok had I not had the cue ball in my other hand. Im still unclear on that part I think it was just a foul for touching the other ball. Not holding the cue ball when it was ball in hand.  I apologized to her first. Shes a good friend of mine and was totally cool with it. She was actually more pissed at them than maybe I was but Id rather get into the argument than get her off her game. She was shooting great and I felt most bad for her but she fully supported my actions and appreciated that I spoke up. Side note. I give awesome back rubs all my friends ask for them and I give them out to all my players to help them relax.

Some guys lie to themselves and act like theyre buying another cue for some obscure technical reason when it really boils down to its a new toy and I want it.Even worse is someone actually believes they need this type of shaft for game A but this other shaft for game B.

Your probably gonna give yourself  a serious rsi like tennis elbow or carple tunnel if you dont find a way to play that doesnt make you numb.

7071484,0,t1_d1huu43, ball strategy for me has less to do with matching up and more to do with strategy within the match.Since sinking the  ball doesnt have any advantage other than  points its better strategy to be concerned with keepingstaying ahead of the required pace to win in terms of points scored.If Im playing a higher SL I know that if I split a rack  on average I will win the match.  Keeping that mentality makes me play a mostly conservative game where I will shoot a few balls in and duck if I get out of line or the runout isnt there.Likewise if Im playing a lower SL I know Im spotting them up to multiple racks.  In these racks Ill play ultraconservative focusing on lockup safeties that are likely to result in ball in hand for me then run what easy shots I can while setting up an opportunity to put them in jail again.  When I get to a point where the handicap is negated Ill play less safeties and take more chances to try to get the runout.,billiards,d1hwzcq,2,t5_2r9yh

7268995,0,t1_d24f8id,The point I was moreso trying to make is that the problem with discussing stroke is that speed is a relative term. I can literally tell someone to use  tip right English and aim at the th diamond and they know what to do. But I cant verbally explain stroke.Soft medium hard  etc these are all relative terms. English amount position etc are not. They are factual.So I think itd be interesting to find a way a type of scale in which to measure stroke so it can be discussed. For example Scoville scale measures spiciness of something. I eat a lot of hot peppers sauce etc. So when I say something is spicy that means its REALLY spicy. But my friends will say something is spicy when its basically just tobasco. So if I were to say its  million on the scoville scale we both know what were talking about.,billiards,d24fnwu,1,t5_2r9yh

The amount of squirt is far higher than most other cues and makes aiming with it difficult.The reason I use it is because I have far better cue ball control once I adapted to playing with the high deflection. For instance shots that require a slight masse are much easier and I get more english which means I can use a harder tip. It also makes shots against the rail a lot easier.If you are going to use a small tip you should probably have a heavier shaft mines just over  oz to get a more solid hit.

9041804,0,t3_542z5t,I just moved away so I cant meet up but here are a few good placesThe best place I know of and the place where the best players seem to go is on Lake City Way way up north. I cant remember the cross streets but its south of th which is where Seattle ends and Shoreline and Lake Forest Park begin. But it is not far south of there. Look up billiards halls on Google maps and you will find it. Its the only one in that area. It is easy to miss driving by. There is just a green and yellow banner that says billiards. They have large tables ? and small tables ? but no medium tables. They are in good condition and they have good straight house cues. They have tournaments and are open super late. Like Ive been there at am before. This place is also very inexpensive and the owner seems like a good guy who loves pool.If thats too far from where youre staying there is a barpool hall I think in Freemont called the Ballroom. They have giant slices of pizza. They have the large sized tables. Its loud and more of a bar setting but the tables are in pretty good condition. Pay by the hour as with all the large sized tables in the city. Rates are highly dependent on the time you go. Sort of expensive at least for me.There is another pool hall in downtown Seattle but it was too far from where I lived so I didnt go there. Very expensive and rates depend on when you go. The University of Washington has a pool hall in the HUB. Im pretty sure you dont have to be a student to play but you might want to call to make sure. Student rates are great and I think its probably not too bad for nonstudents. The felt was old last I was there and many of the cues were bad. Make sure they give you a good set of balls. Some of them are the smaller kind. They have the large tables.These are really the only pool halls I know of but Seattle has lots of great dive bars and they usually have a table or two. The bars in Seattle typically have medium sized tables ? and the correct size of balls. It is usually  cents per game and people usually abide by the usual pool etiquette things like winner keeping the table quarters on table signify next game etc. I recommend checking out the bar scene for pool. There are some good or what I would consider good players out there.  is expensive and . is cheap. But some places are starting to move towards  as prices for EVERYTHING in Seattle are rapidly rising thanks to Amazon.There is one place called the th avenue tavern with FREE pool. Its a small table in a cramped room. The beer is also cheap. At the right time you can get a pitcher for  if I remember correctly. And they have taco Tuesdays. Great staff and really just a great place. The pool table last I saw had been recently refelted and the equipment was in good shape. But the room is very cramped. They have a small cue for awkward shots.Earls on The Ave in the University District attracts some decent players if you dont mind the broy atmosphere. There are a few places to check out in the U district. The College Inn is a popular spot because it has a nice vibe but the pool tables are shitty as well as the cues. Dantes has  pool tables two small two medium but sometimes its a pain in the ass to deal with the people there. It can get pretty crowded. Once I guy was resting against the pool table I was playing at and put his hand on the table moving one of the balls. He moved it back only after I told him but then went on to stand resting his hand in one of the corner pockets. I had the most serendipitous long shot lined up into the corner and you better believe I slammed that cocksucker in as hard as I could minding my accuracy of course. It was pretty satisfying to see it smash into his hand. The only snooker table in Seattle is at the Zoo bar which is not a bar at the zoo. Thats just the name. Its in bad condition. If you go definitely bring your own cue. I dont recommend going though unless you have to.,billiards,d7yoi9h,3,t5_2r9yh

9208126,0,t3_56e92v,Heres my advice for what its worth. Your standard McDermott cues start at about . A butt is going to change very little between cues. You can pick up the same butt structrally but itll have none of the inlay and ornamentation. From there grab yourself a gcore iseries predator or OB shaft for anywhere from  have it tipped how you like it and turned down for about  all told and you just got a cue that plays like  for half that or less.

I shoot horribly when I warm uppractice tend to do decently in league within variances obvs and really shine when the pressure is cranked up to .I think for me its easier for me to get and stay in the right mindset during tournament play.  To paraphrase the great Yogi  of pool is half mental.  For me to play well I have to have singular focus the same preshot mechanics and the same sort of checklist for shot selection and its actually kinda hard to maintain that when Im shooting a dozen racks to warm up or in a scratch game that doesnt mean anything.  Im not asking myself the important questions before those lowimpact racks am I prioritizing the high riskhigh reward shots or playing more safe?  Does this bank put me in a better position than playing a safety?Maybe Im a bit odd but I dont actually watch my team play all that much during the tourney either.  I stay uptodate on the score and our situation but I stay away from the tables as much as I can.  Hell I bring my laptop so I can watch youtube vids and play Stardew Valley in between my stints at the table.  I played baseball for most of my life which is also a team sport played individually so Im used to that aspect of only being able to control my own performances.  Same thing back when I did martial arts tournaments.  You cant expect yourself to stay in the moment at all times but you cant drift so far away that you cant turn it back on when you need it either.You have to figure out the right balance for you to keep yourself focused without tiring.  I think mental fatigue is  of the reason people lose at a tournament.  Especially with the way handicapping and matchups happen in APA theres not a whole lot of chances to play against someone who will really just wipe the floor with you so it often just comes down to who is focused and shooting consistently.So really my advice is to experiment.  At your next tournament change things up.  Banter more with your opponent have a pizza delivered to you listen to music between matcheshell take a nap in your car between matches.  Just do something to break up your routine.,billiards,db0gr4b,1,t5_2r9yh

9981196,0,t3_5iipqr,The strongest vibrations come from the stiffest shafts though a hard tip can also contribute to that feeling somewhat. You want a shaft that flexes easily. That usually means you want a low deflection shaft. Theyre typically made of spliced pieces theyre skinnier than a standard shaft and theyre hollow at the end or filled with a sounddeadening foam. The overall effect is a cue that doesnt vibrate much and doesnt feel stiff. In fact a common complaint from people first trying LD shafts is that the hit feels somehow more dull or dead than a standard shaft. But its never bothered me. Ive used almost exclusively Predator and OB shafts attached to well any butt. The butt wont matter. Mines a Brunswick but Ive also used them on a Predator and Players butt.I would say that you should try before you buy. But if thats not an option and you dont want to risk  on something that might not make you happy... just get a low deflection shaft. Itll cost you  or so. Attach it to the Legend. You have a choice of tips go with a soft one though the shaft is mostly what matters the tip wont feel bad unless its an extra hard or phenolic tip or it hasnt been scuffed.,billiards,db8ktjb,1,t5_2r9yh

10706143,0,t1_ddk8wg7,Any solid wood shaft can be a LD shaft. Low deflection is a term that essentially describes shafts with relatively lightweight construction near the tip end of the shaft. This is achieved most commonly by making the shaft hollow which in my opinion can seriously compromise the strength and durability of the shaft and often filling in the hollow space with a foam or other lightweight synthetic material. I feel like similar effects can be attainable by choosing shaft blanks which are lighter in weight and using a longer thinner taper than what most standard mm factory shafts come with. The best shafts out there are built by custom cue makers and I always recommend visiting your local custom maker to see and learn about the different ways a shaft can be designed and built to your preferences. ,billiards,ddk9bvm,1,t5_2r9yh
10706604,0,t1_ddkanyq,I have actually worked on cues that had fake paintedon butterfly splices. The colorful pattern is created by gluing up sheets of thin colored woods between the larger structural pieces used to construct the majority of the rest of the cue. The resulting pattern features feathery edges which display some of the natural grain characteristics of the wood. The edges of the colors are sometimes wavy and almost transparent due to how thin the overlapping woods are in places. It is a construction style that does not intend to produce crisp razor sharp lines of distinction between the different woods. It is fully intended to be a feathery blended look and that is one of the primary features which people are attracted to with this method of cue making. The smoothness you feel is evidence of good sanding and finishing of the cue after it is turned round. ,billiards,ddkb1iu,5,t5_2r9yh

Concentrate on your mechanics. A solid bridge hand smooth stroke and cueing the center of the ball are critical to being a dependable shooter.

11036232,0,t3_5xd8bn,I used to live there sad to hear Eos closed but when the owner died I was pretty sure his family couldnt run it without him. The ritz was good but last time I was there it was obvious the bowling alley didnt care to take care of the tables. Part of Poolhall Junkies was filmed in both places. Anyway Batters Up on like th and main is a good place but they only have one big table. Bunch of bar diamonds. I cant think of any other places. The pool scene in the late s was pretty strong there and now there arent any legit halls it sounds like. ,billiards,deixran,2,t5_2r9yh

11225107,0,t3_607yup,A sneaky pete is just the design. It has nothing to do with how the cue will hit. Sounds like you might have an issue with the balance andor weight of the cue you own. House cues tend to be on the heavier side like oz. Maybe adjust your cue to match? Often times it also takes some time for one to get used to a new cue. So perhaps give it some more time?,billiards,df4codk,1,t5_2r9yh

I remember once he and Busty were at the TAR studios with a couple of other players and they were all just answering questions and chatting and someone asked Busty how he felt about his performance in a recent tournament I think hed placed highly like ndrd but didnt win.I suck at remembering but when Busty answered it was sort of like eh you know at first I have some problem but after a bit I start to shoot good I think I play ok and Efren says you play like shit! and cackles and they all have a laugh at how he loves to bust Bustys balls.,billiards,dg5vmi6,10,t5_2r9yh
11588646,0,t1_dg9j13h,I would argue only the game is different.  Corey would soft break on a bar box as well as a  table.  Not that the table would have anything to do with it but whatever.  If I had found a legal break in ball that either put the  ball in if it won the game or gave me a significant advantagelikelyhood of running out over a traditional break I would do that every time.  Until its more or less accepted to be detrimental and therefore has a rule against it play whatever shot is within the rules.  Both people know the rules you each have the same opportunity to practice abuse of those rules.  If you decide you want to take the moral high road good luck to you.  That is the bar players opinion on safeties ball in hand etc.  Im for less rules than more.  The less rules get in the way the less ambiguous they are the better.Now if I ran a tournament I would have the rule that  balls have to make it to... halfway up the table or made? I think that is the common rule as the soft break makes it a poor spectator sport.  However if the rules for a tournament Im going to play in doesnt have that rule in play I will absolutely soft break every time Im at the table.  Its the fault of the organizer not me that my strategy is allowed.  And anybody else playing that tournament should realize that a soft break is a possibility.,billiards,dg9kwkr,3,t5_2r9yh

You can definitely get a better cue for  than .However there does seem to be a jump in what you can get for .If you want a great playing American made cue check out schmelke. Baseline for a sneaky is around a  and you can also add customizations for more money. Here is a bunch more you can customize. Personally I think my next cue purchase will be a bocote cue from them with a wrap. As for tip and weight it is personal preference. I personally like a  oz with a . tip. Glue on tip only. Screw on tips are for very cheap cues and usually house cues. ,billiards,dgbs0kc,2,t5_2r9yh
