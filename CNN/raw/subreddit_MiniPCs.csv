1546742,0,t3_2bxidf,The Timingpower rk are good. Ive had  mine for about a year and its still going strong no crashes other than me overloading it once to test it. It has the  chip inside not the t which is good. Obviously they arent as good as an Odroid but for a stick they are the best i know of at that price. Just be sure to check their site for the latest firmware because mine had the previous one on it. Was easy to do though. ,MiniPCs,cja5otu,2,t5_3040h
1568328,0,t1_cjcbywt,Probably not. I had massive UIsystem lag with stock and finless ROMs on the Tronsmart mk. You may be able to get away with p video but itd take a while to bufferload via MX Player.But I suppose if you were just interested in running a samba service or such it wouldnt be a problem. ,MiniPCs,cjcv38j,2,t5_3040h

3142241,0,t1_conoggq,Yeah I did some googling and apparently my cable company supports cablecard but its just not worth the money,MiniPCs,conov6c,1,t5_3040h
3347551,0,t1_cp9u9lg,Youre right about the chip not supporting H.. Its all done in software which means some videos play ok and some wont at all. Definitely where Android players have the upper hand at the moment in the budget space.And I entirely agree with your comments about MINIX  build quality and support are some of the highest in this space. Hence why I could justify the premium they charge for their devices.,MiniPCs,cp9uhat,1,t5_3040h
3373071,0,t1_cpcqbfq,Haha damn windows updates!Oh damn maybe I shouldve waited to get it from B amp H although I thought I checked their price and saw tax. Maybe it depends where you live? Whatever only a  difference.Honestly I dont know if Ive ever fully understood ram despite being a moderately tech savvy person. My desktop for example. I only have the gb it came with. Ive never used more than  of the gb though I think. Maybe ocasionally if I was running photoshop or something I dunno probably didnt check. I know that more ram is good if you multitask a lot or do a lot of editing but I have never really felt slowed down by only having gb. Maybe I will notice it with only having gb and want more.Did you try it before putting in the extra ram or just put the ram in right away?,MiniPCs,cpcr6ta,1,t5_3040h

4262365,0,t3_39pjyq,Im guessing the price jump is due to the change in CPU. The ZF that the cheaper model comes with is a little bit slower and only supports Gb of RAM whilst the GB mode uses the Z  dont think the CPU jump is worth the  tbh,MiniPCs,cs6352f,1,t5_3040h

8818750,0,t3_50x20j,What about integrated graphics vs inbuilt ones? Price range? Any manufacturer youve got interest in or any that your like to avoid?    I looked into these and the gigabyte brix had a few options from celeron up to ultra low voltage i amp i chips with nvidia graphics.

I own several serial dongles to get serial ports on my Mac or Windows notebooks but Ive never seen DOS drivers for any of those USB serial adapters.Not quite a MiniPC but Dells Optiplex  Micro does optionally come with VGA and a Flush serial port whatever that is.,MiniPCs,dci7k3r,3,t5_3040h
10385808,0,t3_5oqrfs,Looks like they have couple of older models for less than  in the spirit of this subreddit . All of them run their customized version Linux not sure what it is based off of. But Im pretty sure they can be massaged to run one of the mainstream distributions.Edit Low end models are based on Amlogic S while higher end ones are Intel Celeron detailed specs are on their shop link,MiniPCs,dclanqu,2,t5_3040h
10917247,0,t1_de5qyjy,Well if you run slmgr.vbs dlv it will show you your current status.  The description field will tell you what version of Windows is installed.  See if its different than the version of Windows for your key. At the bottom of the window it will show you a number for Remaining Windows rearm count.  If that number isnt  you can rearm the system for  days.  To do that type slmgr.vbs rearm and it should give you a success message. ,MiniPCs,de61caf,1,t5_3040h
10994166,0,t1_dedd7m7,Thanks for sharing that link Ive never seen that device before.  Im looking for devices that have encoders for at least VP WebM support and one day VP I hope.  This one has Intels Bay Trail so it doesnt have hardware support for WebM encoding but it looks like an interesting devicecase.Your mileage is going to vary on different cards and operating systems.  Ive been using Pis  Im going to try the Firefly Rockchip  when it comes out in a month or two and the MIPIs on them work great but though theres dedicated circuitry for H. theres nothing for WebM.  I tried Logitechs  mostly Cs but the problem with them is that they use a lot of resource and even on a regular PC its pretty much impossible to use more than one camera simultaneously because the drivers arent written for it.  Im probably sticking to Linux though I might check out Android on the Firefly since it comes with a dual boot install which probably has some pretty optimized libraries for video since they run phones off of it.  On the RPis that Ive used the MIPI is way better at least for my purposes than using USB cameras.,MiniPCs,dee5k97,1,t5_3040h
