2938816,0,t3_2tsvxb,Well I cant really guess as to what they are interested in doing but I can tirelessly trawl through the archive channel to see what they still havent commentated on from over a year ago. Playthroughs on the Archives channel that have not yet appeared in a BrainScratch Commentary are Persona  FES Pokemon Emerald Trauma Team Muramasa Heavy Rain and Devil May Cry . My guess is they will continue to not do these but its safer to bet on Pokemon than any of the other hundreds of viable games for the channel or any of the other thousands of games that exist but have most likely flown under the radar of the group.,BrainScratchComms,co25n3l,1,t5_2urcb
