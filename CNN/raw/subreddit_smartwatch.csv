106127,0,t3_1v3n76,The smartwatch industry is still changing pretty rapidly right now with new competitors constantly entering the market. Sony Smartwatch   great overall look and serves basic needs incredibly well. Music controlemailmessaging alright easy to recognize notifications to a particular service color screen helps replaceable band but suffers from lag and performance issues that render good apps difficult to use like the camera extension gps maps and even music control at times. I got it with my phone and feel it closer to the value of a Pebble...also dont see where the complaints about sunlight come from.PebbleKreyos  Either should be able to hold your fix until the dragons pizzas GoogleApplePerformance smartwatches get released theyre on their way and theyll be just amazing. Both should serve basic needs better than most previously released watches but thats as long as you dont mind falling back to the Mr. Game amp Watch screen era. Replaceable band helps get around the look on the Pebble and the Steel version is what the watch shouldve started with for looks minus price. I forget whats the difference in price between the two but the Kreyos seems better.GalaxyGear  its been done and forgotten great performance that fit the color display well app market with useful apps it shot itself in the foot due to certain issues but worked out well for some in the starting watch market.Neptune PineOmate TruesmartQualcomm Toqetc  Latest smartwatch projects that are just beginning to get out into the market where performance is the focus and I believe somewhere in this group would be the watch youre looking for but these watches just miss getting the wearable look.You can start to see the game smartwatches are playing with wearable look Pebble Steel and sheer performance Neptune Pine. Ideally I still wouldnt have a smartwatch yet but I had received it with my phone but I love the look with a metallic band. Really Id still wait for something that hits what Im looking for right and if youre still buying a phone it sounds like you can wait for a bit longer...or you can avoid all reasonable advice and get a Nissan Smartwatch...and a Nissan GTR because they both look great and are just that over the top.,smartwatch,ceqiieh,2,t5_2u5ss

3931592,0,t3_35fdrp,Are you referring to the original Galaxy Gear or one of the later gear watches? I can tell you the the original Galaxy Gear that ran android that you could then put Null Rom on was great. Best smart watch of all Ive had. It was more awesome than a monkey wearing a tuxedo made out bacon riding a cyborg unicorn with a lightsaber for the horn on the tip of a space shuttle closing in on Mars while ingulfed in flamesquote source BUT... But they run a little hot with all that awesomeness and it severely limited the lifespan of the device. I had a few of them all setup the same wall. All died after the same amount of use almost down to the day and all with the same failure. Ive since used a Gear Fit LG G Watch Moto  and Gear S. Of all those Id avoid the Fit like the plague the G watch is serviceable as a now budget AW device the  looks a little nicer than the G watch has a almost useless heartbeat sensor but having wifi now enabled should be more useful so it gets . legs up. The Gear S has been the most useful and most versatile of the bunch. Having both wifi and a cell connection can do that. Its a stand alone phone that also happens to connect to your primary phone for notifications. The heartbeat and UV sensors are useless IMO but its ability to let you leave you phone behind while still having music getting your notifications and not missing calls more than makes up for that. Having both a speaker and a mic on a smart watch are essential IMO. That is what I learned after having both on the original Gear and not again until I had the S.,smartwatch,cr4fqiq,1,t5_2u5ss

4336680,0,t3_3alibc,Currently there is no round smartwatch that is actually decent works with iOS and has a camera at least that I know of. There might be a really cheap Asian one out there somewhere but I wouldnt recommend getting one. There is a new smartwatch coming out at the end of the summer called the Vector Luna. It features a round watchface that has a memory LCD display which means it is only in black and white so no colors. It doesnt have a camera but it is compatible with iOS and is said to have a  day battery life... ,smartwatch,cseh281,1,t5_2u5ss

5167903,0,t3_3lmyhd,Cowboom has had the LG G Watch st generation not the R model on sale for  AC in and out of stock the last few days.  The coupons good another day or so if they get any more in stock.  I last saw them available Saturday morning around am.  Youll need to get the charge dock though as thats not included from Cowboom  they run  on eBay.  Pricewise for  thats your best bet if you can get it.  Especially if youre not fully convinced you wantneed a smart watch.Some dont like the flat tire look on the Moto  e.g.  so if that bugs you Id skip it.  FWIW the Chinese imports like No. TT or SS have the same issue but even more noticeably.  The LG G Watch R manages to avoid it though possibly due to thicker bezel more room for internal components?.The Pebble Time seems like a good option too but fairly pricy for what you get unless your priority is battery lifesimplicity over the extra features you get from Android Wear.,smartwatch,cv8x88b,1,t5_2u5ss
5321274,0,t1_cvrun4e,Solved by being careful or having a warranty. Do your research and you can replace the whole watch for free over the counter if it breaks without paying for an extra warranty.,smartwatch,cvrushj,1,t5_2u5ss
5567817,0,t1_cwmazof,OK here are the pictures... As you can see there are some scuffs on the screen but the watch still works fine.  Its been sitting in my desk drawer for a couple of weeks since I bought a Moto  so it didnt have a charge.  It was previously lasting me about  or  days on a charge though. Its not mint but its not bad.   and whatever shipping will cost me where are you? and its yours. ,smartwatch,cwn8lo8,1,t5_2u5ss

10724725,0,t3_5tewht,I am in the same boat. Though I never liked Fitbit products. They are expensive and dont do much for the money. Eg. I picked up Xiaomi mi band  for  which has much more functionality then  Fitbit bands. Not sure if future Fitbit products will be any different. So IMO go for Samsung if you have to decide between Samsung and Fitbit. ,smartwatch,ddm6c18,1,t5_2u5ss

10948556,0,t3_5v5p6r,I personally was very excited for the Gear S to finally be compatible with iOS and purchased one as soon as it was. I went into it knowing there would be limited functionality. Here is what is missing compared to using the S with an Android device from my personal use most of the available watch faces however there is still quite a few options was not an issue for me most of the apps available are not compatible and my biggest complaint is not being able to respond to messagesnotifications. With that being said being able to view all notifications at least allows me to decide if my phone is worth picking up to respond which I appreciate. I had no connection issues with the two devices but Ive read that this is somewhat of common issue the devices losing connection causing you to relaunch the app. If your primary needs are viewing messages or seeing whos calling tracking basic fitness theres very few commonpopular options in the store and of course seeing the time...its a very good option. Nothing to do with using with an iPhone but the watch is quite comfortable and the rotating bezel REALLY makes the device simple to use and more fun than just a touchscreen. ,smartwatch,de99l67,1,t5_2u5ss
