Looks like they were done by three incredibly different artists.Nitpicks Id get rid of the beveling on the title of . Doesnt look good or match the others. The kerning could benefit from too. And is that a system font?My guess is that the author picked up stock art by different artists and then put hisher own typography on top of it. Heshe didnt do bad at all  the typographical nitpicks could be ignored if the series had a unified look and clearly communicated genre. Covers dont need to be great they just need to be effective in reaching the target readers. Right now theres really no way to tell what these covers are trying to communicate.,judgebooksbythecover,ckgun7m,3,t5_33j8p
