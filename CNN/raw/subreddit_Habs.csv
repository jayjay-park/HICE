2428940,0,t1_cmbv5f6,gt There is plenty of statistical evidence that the problem is MT.Correlation doesnt imply causation. You may be right but we cant determine this for certain. It may also be the case that the blame for low possession numbers lies with the players and not the coach or some degree of both. gt Hockey has a random element to it that doesnt work its way out of the sample until quite close to the end of the season.Random to the extent that anything can be random in the universe yes. Luck no.Not trying to get philosophical here but the bottom line is that statistics by their very definition attempt to provide inferences about reality. Due to various limitations imposed by physics and the nature of information you can never truly attain absolute knowledge whether it relates to a hockey game or anything else.My point is this yes the stats suggest something is wrong with MT yes the stats suggest the team is getting better results than it should but statistics arent reality they are an approximation of reality. So as long as the team is winning I see no reason to fire MT or get up in his face about his stats. If that changes which it might then well talk.,Habs,cmbx9xm,2,t5_2r10m

2474627,0,t3_2nwet1,Thats an easy one. A majority of Habs fans are Frenchspeaking. Habs games are carried across several Frenchonly networks. There are many Frenchonly newspapers and other media that carry Habs content. The history of the Montreal Canadiens is steeped in Quebec culture a culture that is based in cultural solidarity and the concept of a distinct society. Having a coach that does not speak French is simply unacceptable in the eyes of those who have supported and continue to support the Habs and to those who interview the coach and report back to those fans.

3103933,0,t1_cojn3jc,Wow. Sorry but last year he looked very much like a bust. He was badly out of shape and his skating was nowhere near where it needed to be.  He was not getting ice time as a  year old in the OHL. Thats terrible for a first line pick who should be dominant.    He talked in the summer about what a rude awakening it was and he really impressed with his improved fitness and skating.    This year he showed that he is hugely USEFUL to elite players like max Domi.  I think you are a little confused about what it takes to be a first line player. It doesnt mean you have to be Crosby or even the third bet forward on the team.     As far as the hands its true hes not going to dangle his way around any defensemen who are paying attention. He has good soft hands in close though for tip ins and rebound opportunities.     With his size he really is turning into a force in front of the net screening goalies chopping not in rebounds and tipping some in too.     Hes not a sure thing by any stretch but his ceiling? That means how good could he possibly be and he could be a devastating player. ,Habs,cojpzef,1,t5_2r10m

Healy may not have been a great goaltender compared to others in the NHL but the fact that he was in the NHL for many years yet means he was a damn good goalie. Why wouldnt he refer to those experiences when talking about the game hes spent his whole life with?Disclaimer I think Healy and Kypreos are terrible analysts.

3751610,0,t1_cqjw0ic,Always having possession is ideal because then the opposition wouldnt have the puck thus making it impossible for them to score. Unless someone pulls a Markov like in game one.... Anyway everyone knows its impossible to possess the puck the entire game? Jack said that chipping the puck off the glass and out is a terrible way to break out of the zone which is true. Exiting the Dzone with possession is a better strategy IF its an option. It wasnt in this particular case. Did he say it was possible to break out with possession in this play? No.He says Emelin doesnt have any other option which is true. That implies Emelin made a good read of the developing play. Heres a different angle. Youll see here that Mitchell and Weise are already flying the zone in anticipation for the pass so Emelin doesnt really have much of a choice but to shoot the puck out. He didnt say he had no choice but to make a bad play for possession purposes.If you look at the fourth slide the one labelled with MTL  and MTL  If Mitchell misses that puck or it bounces on him which is incredibly likely seeing as it hadnt settled after bouncing off the glass the Ottawa player beside him can tip it right back to Karlsson who can the make a tight turn to enter the zone with possession because Mitchell and Weise would be behind the play.Not sure what your beef with the article is other than that it mentions possession and he doesnt gloat over Emelin making the play of the century for a basic zone clearing.,Habs,cqjwrew,6,t5_2r10m

Also Im aware the game is more complex than getting more shots and Im aware you can be a winning team even if you lose in shots Montreal Canadiens is a good example many times of exactly this. However what I also think is that if you keep getting outshot by that much like in almost  shots against when you get you are not going to win long term. Tldr its not the getting outshot that was my point its the getting outshot by a huge marginEdit. I dont want to take anything away from sens youre a terrific team and Im not saying the game was taken from us by hockey gods or something. I just think that in this game we would on average win if it were played a  times somehow if you know what I mean to take away the luck factor.

Karlsson was on the ice for like every game winning goal. It looked embarrassing. Yes we have the best Goalie in the world we are well aware but we also an elite NHL sniper in Pacioretty and a th line that reminded Hammond of his proper place in the ECHL in game one. Hell even Dale Weise won us a game by beating Karlsson and making Anderson look like an idiot.

Big Mac still needs to work on his skating to play at NHL speeds but thats normal for players in their positions. A year or  in the AHL will be good for them.I also cant believe I forgot Bozon.

The fact that we went down  is not his fault and the fact the the habs didnt show up for game  is not his fault. Did he coach like shit in the regular season? Im not going to say he was a good coach by NHL standards but he got the job done. Was he a bad coach come playoffs? He was excellent. We generated plenty of scoring and outplayed Tampa we lost because our team showed up to game  with no will to win a coach cant change that.

You cant anticipate someone getting it and being allowed to hit them. If you have the puck and someone is in your wayhitting you you can absolutely go through them but you cant be skating up the ice let the puck go and just drill a guy because he didnt have the puck so what are you trying to separate him from. ,Habs,cwmvzxl,1,t5_2r10m

The hardest part about our trade scenario is a lot of players easily lost value in our slump. You could see key players who may not have played a major points related role but they contributed to the team deteriorate before your eyes. DD is our prime example. I believe he has the capability to be good. However his value after going that many games with a  wont fetch change. Lars Eller is the same. Emelin is NTC Flash is an addon at best Smith  Pelly God bless my buddy I hope he finds his groove again from the ahl carries no value and our prospects are an extreme gamble...

6386222,0,t3_434qz6,gt Of course this isnt groundbreaking analysis and I dont want to present it as such but the fact of the matter is that the Habs have a tendency to make life easy on opposing goaltenders by not forcing them to move. Their northsouth offense is boring and is leading to a decline in high danger scoring chances. They like to concentrate on creating chances on the rush but its clear that opposing teams have adapted and are more than comfortable allowing low quality chances.So last season remember last season when we were winning a lot? the team and players had a poor Corsi and everyone was complaining that they dont shoot enough and that the team would be found out and that there was no such thing as high danger scoring chances.This year the team starts shooting more the Corsi stats look good but we cant score and were not getting enough of these high quality opportunities.Does that not strike anyone as odd?

Make PK captain. Let young players like Ghetto and Carr have a big role next year. Bring Hudon in see how McCarron does these next  games.

Use PatchesPlekEller combination of some sort in a package to get a top winger like Eberle Hall or OkposoAnyone of edmonton a forwards would do.

They are both capable but ELLER imo when he is allowed to play offensively he makes his line mates better and does so with a physical presence. I think that will show under Muller. DD can help a team needing a band aid solution as in that scenario he could slot into a number  role with good wingers and suceed.

8717006,0,t1_d6v8nhc,gtRinaldo does not produce very many goalsI know I said he was a bad example. I still believe frontnet presence offers much more than simply high danger shots. While these people are pros they are still human and will get annoyed by pests. You should realize that more than anybody being a Gallagher fan! Gally offers a lot of options to his line and distracts the goalie.gtNot quantifiable and unlikely to effect a single gameWhile that is true it drives many small changes in a game. When you hear players say they dont want to face Shea Weber they likely have that in mind on the ice Oh god not Weber can I go around him or not? Or something like that. These are not quantifiable and cannot be measured at all but it exists and it does change the outcome of some plays. Maybe the player pays too much attention on Weber and someone else can pokecheck the puck or hit the player. Theres a lot of random events this is what makes hockey so hard to calculate.gtDuring the regular season a bottom feeder like Rinaldo might hit the same player a couple times and likely not the oppositions top player.Hence why its important to use context. Obviously Rinaldo hitting Byron will be useless and wont affect anything. However if theres a devastating hit on Karlsson or Seguin you have a much higher chance of changing the outcome of the game. If you hit someone like Lucic or Perry they might look at you more than at the puck. Thats what Emelin does so well it drove Lucic mad. gtHowever screening goalies is not a skill in and of itself and those who do it are very much replaceable I kind of agree but not everybody can do that job. The mentality of the player plays a key role in screening the goalie. Someone like Plekanec sometimes screen but hes really not that efficient in pushing guys so he gets pushed back. However Gally and Shaw fights hard for their spot and they dont back down. It creates more chances to distract a goalie or draw a cross check penalty. Yet again those are extremely contextual and will only affect single plays rather than a game. ,Habs,d6v9jj7,1,t5_2r10m

Im going to risk being downvoted here because this sub seems to be really high on McCarron but I just dont see it. He has decent speed but his first three strides are not quick enough and I find that it really shows. I dont think hes particularly skilled either and he makes a lot of questionable plays with the puck. I wouldnt be against giving DLR a shot on the fourth I think he can bring a different package than big Mac and hes got pts in his last  games so maybe a reward for his good play will help his confidence.

10675561,0,t1_ddh3byt,Your point that this is one of our best teams in years is what really pisses me off. We have SO much fucking talent in this team. Carey fucking Price Shea Weber Max Pacioretty Alexander Radulov Andrei Markov Alex Galchenyuk and all these other guys being wasted. We have one of the most solid rosters in the league and its being totally wasted because were not utilizing them to their potential. When you put Shaw in place of Radulov and Danault in place of Galchenyuk and all these other moves that are throwing our top tier guys where they shouldnt be just wastes the talent we have. Those decisions are on Therrien. When we cant pull it together and score in a game where we go down by one or two goals because of lack of morale thats on Therrien. I dont think Therrien is a bad coach but hes not the coach for us because he makes us so inconsistent. We need a  change but it doesnt seem like Bergevin is willing to do that which is a shame because I really like him as a GM. something has to change if our cupcaliber team can actually be cupcontenders.,Habs,ddh3qk8,5,t5_2r10m

10685430,0,t1_ddi0zc3,Good or bad scout doesnt really make him qualified for GM.  There have been more than one bust over his tenure I just didnt think I needed to list several to make my point.  I know drafting players is usually a crap shoot but I dont think his choices are better than other scouts.  Granted Habs usually dont have a top  pick but I dont think he is the be all and end all of the scouting world and even if he was this does not qualify him to be the GM on that quality alone.  He has never been close to the GM position as an assistant or consultant.  GMs have completely different set of skills required than a scout.  ,Habs,ddi4dxm,1,t5_2r10m

We could definitely use more scoring but we also just need our current scorers to step up.. MB doesnt like to overpay we know this. He will only trade for Duchene if we give away picks and good but not amazing prospects or lower line players.

10994085,0,t3_5wzja4,Sergachev is brand new and D develop late. This window given to us with Price and Patches and PK exchanged for Weber will close. As thats happening well want to be picking and developing the pieces of our next core. We might have a slump in the middle. Trade Sergachev and the next two years are the last chance we have to win a Cup for the next . Keep him and we might be able to build something relevant for after Price goes. In this way you can see a team as having phases rather than windows most likely to win in some phases and impossible to win during others. We can win a Cup with this phase if Weber can be as good as PK and Price wins it for us. It takes a bit of luck to win a cup a goalie as hot as Price can get at his best might be enough. We would need Price to be a god with or without Duchene. Price being God wont be enough unless Weber and Patches can both be legitimately considered some of the best players in the NHL though. ,Habs,dee58bx,4,t5_2r10m

We were about  minutes away from being shutout in back to back games the other night. You could be right about Radulov not being  and the flu still going around but I dont think its time to assume the future of our team wont be able to perform anymore because theyve been in a slump. We didnt bench Price when he had a terrible month we kept playing him and he returned to his former glory. I dont think we should be burying players in our lineup who we know have the talent to succeed just because theyve been underachieving lately. I dont have high hopes that Plekanec will have much more to contribute at this point in his career but Gallagher certainly isnt past his prime.

11396416,0,t1_dfnr6j5,I think it serves two purposes really Its radio friendly and a lot more...not casual but easier to digest then most of Kendricks work. Like I love almost all of his last album but I wouldnt want to be pumping How Much a Dollar Cost or his more reflective tracks at a party. Its like King Kunta or Backseat FreeStyle it will fit with the rest of the tracks on the album but can be played without context. Secondly I think its Kendrick sending a warning to other hip hop artists out there to sit down and be humble because Kendrick is one of the greatest rappers of our generation and IMO of all time. He can create meaningful and culturally relevant albums but he can also go hard and create easy to listen to party anthems and beat other artists at their own game. Mostly though I think hes just experimenting with different sounds this is a very unique sounding track distinct from Section.  Good Kid Maad city and To Pimp a Butterfly.

I got so sick of Gally and the rest of the Hab haters on CBC so I decided to try NBC which admittedly isnt technically an all Rangers broadcast.  I wouldnt call them balanced but they were much more fair to Montreal.  A few years ago I had a British buddy over and turned on the HNIC broadcast.  Halfway through the first period he asked why we werent watching the Canadian broadcast.  I said we were the Habs were playing the Phlyers or Columbus or something.  He asked if the other team just had more Canadian players or something why do they cheer for the away team instead of the Canadian one.  I just wryly told him this is how it is in Canada for some reason.  But he should watch a leaf game youd be hard pressed to know another team was even on the ice.  He told me if an English broadcaster was that negative towards an English team while they were playing a German or Spanish team their building would be burnt down that night and the announcers strung up in the streets.  ,Habs,dgdeevr,5,t5_2r10m
