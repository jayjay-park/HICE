230047,0,t1_cf2bhlx,Those are good. I like horizontal frontpoints better for alpine ice like ice climbs on mount washington. They are a little harder to kick into vertical ice but if you are just getting into the sport you should start with those since youll be toproping mostly and it is good to experiment with alpine crampons before you go to vertical frontpoints. ,iceclimbing,cf4lbtj,1,t5_2t83t
922187,0,t3_24o71v, I inevitably end up chopping the ends and my m rope becomes  over a season. I might consider a different rope though. Personally if you want a Mammut rope like linkn mentioned thats more durable and thicker go for the m Mammut Infinity .MM. Shes a real beauty and my goto rope.,iceclimbing,ch93wqo,1,t5_2t83t
2228460,0,t3_2kltbs,It depends! There were times last winter where driving on the  was like driving on an ice rink for over a week after it snowed. Yea the roads will be plowed but it depends on the conditions as to how much ice will or wont be on the road. This was driving west from billings.  One thing I would suggest! Buy as many raffle tickets as possible! They raffle off huge amounts of quality gear! It goes to a good cause so if you dong win its still great! I think I bought  in raffle tickets and made my money back  times over in gear!I think last year I stayed at the rainbow motel?? Not sure but I used booking.com. they do have an unlimited alcohol thing so if you drink get something close by. ,iceclimbing,cln39i5,1,t5_2t83t

6372675,0,t1_cz7nz2t,Not really. It gives you an approximation of difficulty but its pretty meaningless to compare outside of that. A lot of times routes will have a YDS grade along with an M grade which usually indicates they climbed without tools for a portion and mixed it up for the other.,iceclimbing,cze047j,1,t5_2t83t

8448266,0,t3_4v9mhr,Im not familiar with your area but if youre going to do anything higher than  m Id go for twins. I seldom use the option of clipping ropes individually but I find the ability to rap full  m absolutely essential when you get off the ground a bit and if youre clipping both ropes in every piece its not that much more hassle.I do sometimes climb ice on single ropes but thats only short stuff when you can walk off or on a top rope.In particular if you already have a dry treated single rope for other climbing I dont see the point in getting one more for this job.,iceclimbing,d5xkjhb,1,t5_2t83t
9696563,0,t3_5dux25,Ive got a pair of Petzl Lynx set up in mono on my Nepals.  Prior to that Ive used Sarkens and Cyborgs and thought both were completely fine.  But switching over to mono was a huge difference for me in all terrain.On mixed and dry routes there is no comparison  if you are in mono youre just more stable and more precies.On Ice it takes a day or so to get used to it particularly on featured ice.  Sometimes I would kick like I would with two points and find that my mono was in a runnel I was just bashing ice with my boot.  But after  minutes of that I started to place my points carefully. The precision and stability on ice is crazy. I wouldnt go back.That being said the Lynx seems like the crampon to go for.  It takes a few minutes to change the setup unlike the cyborg which requires some bullshittery.,iceclimbing,da8b2pd,1,t5_2t83t

10636613,0,t1_ddd0c70,Oh okay so those are leashed tools. I didnt even mention them because leashes are pretty much out of style these days though youll still see the occasional old fart running around with a pair of leashes. With leashes the swing is a little different some say you are able to swing harder with leashes but I cannot verify. You also know that youre never going to drop that tool if you are using leashes. The trade off is basically safety and convenience. With leashless tools you are a lot less likely to dislocate a shoulder if you get a tool stuck in the ice and fall especially as a beginner. Additionally leashes make it impossible to switch the hand youre using on a tool which is pretty important when climbing thin or traversing ice and mixed. When people want a little security about dropping tools these days they will use umbilicals.In terms of those specific tools you could always take the leashes off but then you still do not have a middle rest which is pretty important though not crucial until you get climbing really hard stuff for those same instances where you would want to switch hands. I dont believe you would be able to get a middle rest for these tools from BD but shoot them a call or an email and maybe they could work something out. ,iceclimbing,ddd32ob,1,t5_2t83t
