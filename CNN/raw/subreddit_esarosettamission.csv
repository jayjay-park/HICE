2354198,0,t1_cm2m8ml,Putting it in orbit in itself is a very very VERY difficult task if you watch the videos on what kind of crazy maneuvers it did just to be able to establish orbit. This is due to the very low mass of the comet compared to moons or planets. Im no rocket scientist but I think achieving a synchronous orbit means a greater orbital height and less room for error. Plus if the lander somehow ends up out of sight youre screwed. This way theres always a window for communication no matter where the lander and Earth is.,esarosettamission,cm2ou9x,3,t5_33o3d
