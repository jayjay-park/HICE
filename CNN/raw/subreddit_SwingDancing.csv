Also if you are working on a more advanced move try not to lead it over and over and over again in the same dance.  Generally I dont mind when a lead messes something up and then wants to try it again but it can be a bit grating when it keeps going and you feel like a practice dummy rather than a dance partner.  To answer the side question Love  musical interpretation sometimes works sometimes doesnt but its always fun.  Hate  underarm ducks.      ,SwingDancing,cf3587r,3,t5_2rga7

318151,0,t1_cfdn3fo,...Im not sure what youre responding to in my post because I mostly agree.  As an avid balboa dancer Id certainly take issue with the notion that its not a swing dance!I use the term swing dance to refer to dances that work to what would be considered swing music ECS Lindy hop Charleston Collegiate Shag Balboa etc.  While it obviously has a common history as the name implies I dont consider modern WCS a swing dance.  Id consider Boogie Woogie and Carolina Shag to be borderline.  I think this is a useful way to use the term because compatibility of the dances with the music thats being played is what matters when youre putting on an event.  If you advertise a swing dance people who know swing dances are going to show up.  If you play Maroon  and beach music all night theyre going to be pretty unhappy with you because the styles of movement that they know dont fit the songs.  Advertise the same thing as a West CoastCarolina Shag fusion event and people will be tickled.  ,SwingDancing,cfdqugd,4,t5_2rga7

885313,0,t3_247l7e,Im not a professional just in advance tracks and a local teacher so take what I see for what its worth. Just gonna mention the things I havent seen other people say. You look like youre having a ton of fun which is one of the most crucial parts of swing. Good for you.   Okay this one was said. You dont really isolate any parts of your body. This in my opinion is one of the largest ataglance determinants of whether someone looks good dancing. I suck at it too. This comes out in some unnecessary bending of your body and arms at times. I love seeing expression but it looks uncontrolled.  You tend to rock onto your heel at random points and during your rock step. You should strive to never be on your heels! The connection happens from downup not updown. When you complete a turn sometimes you raise the hand or keep it raised and force the connection. Say in a ladys turn as she goes under your arm your arms should fall back to resting with no tension or work from you at all as she moves past you. The connectiontension naturally happens as you move apart.  Your connection leaves your partner unsure of what you want. Multiple times in the video you jump at a good part of the song but your body is disconnected from hers so shes left to guess by sight what you want. Any part of your body that can connect with hers within boundaries should be used as a connection point so for jumps your shoulder elbow forearm wrist maybe fingers and the side of your torso. If Im jumping Im going to prep her with a tighter connection and intentional early down movement so she knows its coming.  Never kill the momentum. It is your friend your companion and your guide. This means keeping moving in whatever direction you choose of course but there will always be a direction. Even in a sugar push the momentum simply changes direction  it never stops.  You have really good musicality. Never lose that! At  you hit the break with something awesome and your foot taps the ground with the cymbal. Freakin love it.  It seems like you overextend the momentum necessary to accomplish what you want to. A few times when you have her left hand in your right and you turn to the outside to cock her to spin you overdo it and end up with too much momentum. This can be confusing to a follow as she may think you want her to spin all the way to the water fountain when all you wanted was a quick turn.  Ive been guilty of this often as Im having too much fun.  Sometimes you lose your frame in situations like the one above. If its not coming from your body you have to work harder and it wont be as clear. Quite often a lead coming from the body with a lot less force can be stronger and more clear than one with more mmph put into it from the arms.  Honestly the challenge I would give you is to be aware of what your body is doing. Learn to isolate keep your frame almost a part of isolations and be lazy where appropriate  dont force a connection let it happen. Lindy Hop can get really tiring really fast and most of what we do can be done with minimal effort  which actually makes it look better. You have what cant be taught keep learning what can be. Best of luck. Edit Looking back at the video it looks like you were doing some of the things you were doing to compensate for your follow. Its am and I dont have the energy to ascertain which. I apologize if I was wrong on any of my points! ,SwingDancing,ch4wvxf,2,t5_2rga7

2121469,0,t3_2j714h,Subtle tip for competition and competition only set up your swing outs so that youre on the judges left and the follow is on the judges right. this lets them see more of you and if your follow does swivels more of that without the visual interrupt of your arms across your body. When you do kicks it looks like youre doing them from a very upright place this will limit your follows ability to counterbalance so  any styling she wants to do that takes normal counterbalance is out the window  its slightly harder for her to feel where youre at and  youre not developing the strong stretch that will serve a super awesome swingout. The third is less of a problem at that tempo but as they get faster it will be more of a big deal. You have grown so much in the past few months its pretty amazing!

2972410,0,t3_2u6ui4,Ive only been in a few JnJ but heres what Ive been told and what Ive noticedPrelimsIn the prelims you might dance a couple times with different people each time and you are judged as an individual dancer. the first  Ts that uickeroomorgan  mentioned apply here the most. THere is definitely an element of luck involved because dancer chemistry is definitely going to make it easier or harder to execute cleanly. The thing about prelims is that the judges want to see precision and cleanliness not necessarily showmanship. In the end if you can communicate to the judges that you know what youre doing and EVERYTHING you are doing is intentional youll be fine.FinalsThis is where things get a bit more hairy. Some JnJs say youre still judged individually where you rotate once or twice again whereas others will judge you as a couple. If youre judged as a couple showmanship as a team is important. if one person is just doing their own variations all the time or doing things that dont mesh with what the partner is doing you are going to be docked a lot of points. musicality plays a much bigger role in the finals. also theres often an audience for finals too so theres that.,SwingDancing,co5z8an,2,t5_2rga7

5934124,0,t3_3wkpsu,I think a version of this post shows up here about once a week. I only point that out to emphasize that this is a universal feeling. Everyone knows that it stinks at the beginning because we remember.  I dance with beginners frequently and I honestly enjoy it for several reasons. One is that I love the infusion of new energy. In most scenes the advanced dancers are dancing with each other all the time. Its honestly just nice to have a new person to dance with. A second reason is that I love when new people learn this dance. This is a niche hobby the average person probably doesnt even know what Lindy Hop looks like and probably cant name a swing tune except for maybe Sing Sing Sing and so to see new people come in and make a serious effort to learn this dance I love is awesome. A third reason is that dancing simply can be a nice break. Have you ever been in class where there are extra leaders and you have to sit out for a spot or two in the rotation? Isnt it nice to get a little break sometimes to let your body and more importantly your mind rest for a bit? Sometimes its like that for me at a dance. If Ive been dancing with leaders who have been leading a lot of complicated patterns or for whatever reason I feel a bit creatively taxed its really nice to have a simple dance. I cant stay in high gear the whole night and taking things back to basics can be great.Some practical advice I have for you is to try to maintain good rhythm while you social dance. If rhythm is something you struggle with thats okay just make it your first priority to focus on that rather than trying to do all the moves you know. A total lack of rhythmic predictability is one thing that can make a dance challenging for me to enjoy but if a leader is maintaining good rhythm and has a friendly disposition I can enjoy nothing more than side stepping. One thing I wish all leaders knew is that its not your job to make a dance interesting for a follower. The follower has  of the responsibility for making a dance enjoyable. Even if were just side stepping for the whole dance Ill be trying to make the dance nice for you too. And yeah bring some of your classmates with you next time! ,SwingDancing,cxxhsua,4,t5_2rga7

Again I dont follow much but Id guess if youre turning the wrong way you might be going I think my lead wants me to turn so Im going to turn! And it doesnt work as well. One thing you might want to try is listening to the lead and if you dont hear anything dont do anything even if you think you supposed to.

6290303,0,t1_cz4k14x,I think the best leadfollow analogy Ive heard is that the dance is like a coloring book.  The leads turn the page and the followers fill in the colors on the page. Sometimes its cool to draw outside the lines.  Sometimes its cool to change the page as the follow.  Sometimes its cool to take over coloring as the lead and wait for the follower to change the page.I wouldnt quite say it isnt an actual dialogue.  It might just be softer than what you want.  This is something I find far easier in blues for the same reason that the music is slower.  If the lead isnt noticing the variations then they arent experienced.  Thats usually the thing I look for most and try and give room for.Theres a reason for the three and a thing lead pattern its to give room to the follow to do cool shit and then whip out something cool.I switch dance Lindy a lot.  I dont like doing it randomly tho.  Theres a tendency for people to hijack during tuck turns and things like that and Im a fucking big guy and follows have almost taken my arm off doing that the best example was when I felt a follow really back leading a move in a n early class and I decided to change the pattern and she just stopped me mid motion with a big nooo thats not what were doing! And almost took my arm out the socket.  I learned my lesson and now I at least warn them Im going to try something different lol.When I switch at Lindy myself and my partner essentially give up the lead by putting ourselves into the following position.  I frankly dont like the idea of an ambitious Lindy leadfollow dance sounds way fun for blues tho.  I think the chances of getting hurt are just too high without a lot of practice and having some frank discussion about when and where its a good idea to hijack.Im not quite sure where you get the idea that footwork variations arent communicating at Lindy.  The dance is primarily about rhythm and so when the follow plays with it they are playing with the most important aspect of the dance. Well done musical breaks are also amazing. I still fondly remember when a follow ate my tuck turn and absorbed it into a break and just laughed at me.  I dont think Ive cracked up so hard during a dance ever.  Totally caught me off guard and I loved it.  Im very very open to follower play as a lead however.  So yymv.,SwingDancing,cz4mxkl,3,t5_2rga7

Also dance faster music quite often and it doesnt mean switching to Charleston basic running on triples is as fun. The UK seems more relaxed people often happy with fewer movesvariations and just come to have fun on socials. Classes rarely look like hard work it is another type of social at a time.

I will explain Frequently a lot of people have a higher perception of their skill than the reality. How good you think you are will vary widely when you are still coming out being a beginner. Expect this to last for about another year.  By practicing receiving feedback and working with a videomirror you can develop a better sense of where you really are. Level tests and even comp judging are frequently imprecise. There are simply so many dancers and things to keep track of that the judges really only look for outliers in these tests. You can get a general idea of how good you are from these things but I wouldnt put too much stock into them.,SwingDancing,d6c9v2q,7,t5_2rga7

8859418,0,t3_51i36y,I think the Lindy scene on the whole is refreshingly admitting of a large variety of body types. Granted Im not talking specifically about who wins competitions which is not something I pay much attention to. But I notice who is in the high levels of competitions and with regard to body proportions there is not a very meaningful generalization you could make about a group that includes Joanna Lucero Alice Mei Nina Gilkenson Laura Glaess and Ramona Staffeld. Or Mikey Pedroza Thomas Blacharz Anthony Chen Peter Strom and Todd Yannacone. At most we could say that at higher levels you will tend to see people who are heightweight proportionate broadly speaking. But they can be short medium or tall stocky average or lanky curvy athletic or slight. And for a visual art form where the body is the instrument I find that pretty cool. I think that says something about how expansive Lindy is as a danceartcommunication form.Race is another issue and I dont feel qualified to comment on whether the race of high level competitors is proportional to the general demographics of the scene. Certainly we could add age to the list of issues as well. It will be interesting to see what happens to the current crop of Alist  somethings  when and how age will become an issue for them.,SwingDancing,d7crz57,7,t5_2rga7

I cant focus the direction of the sound my mouth makes on a single point if you keep moving me around!That said if youre the one initiating conversation pay attention to how the follow is responding. If it seems like theyre genuinely into the conversation keep at it but if it sounds like theyre just responding to be polite stick to dancing and save the chitchat for later.

And what made it special wasnt the skills of the dancers it was the fact that as soon as someone stepped up we were hooting and hollering and clapping our asses off. And whenever someone did something awesome everyone in the room would scream. I think a lot of times jam circles are like YouTube video sharing.

9988729,0,t3_5in2cn,I do love leather shoes I wear them for following a lot.  It does amplify techniquebody movementbalance issues because you can no longer use your legs to compensate for them.  I do find leading in leather soled shoes really difficult.  My two main problems are    Trying to initiate movements with my legsknees rather than with the core of my body.  I think if your core is in the right place and youve led your partner using your core your feet will have to come with you.    Ignoring the momentum of my partner.  E.g. when rotating on a swingout in leather shoes its much easier to use the momentum of my partner coming towards me to lead my own rotation rather than forcibly turning myself.  Leather shoes basically force me to dance using the technique of initiate a stretchcompression using my core and then redirect my partners momentum to where they should go rather than just walking through patterns.  I think this feels nicer from the followers point of view!However if your shoes dont fit right and you cant flex your feet in them then youre probably not going to be able to move well enough to keep your balance.  Youre probably better off wearing sticky shoes that do fit you.If your shoes fit but you end up twisting your ankle you might need more ankle stability.  Google ankle stability exercises if youd like to try someassess yourself.,SwingDancing,db9k4u3,2,t5_2rga7
