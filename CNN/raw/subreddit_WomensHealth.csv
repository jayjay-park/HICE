5400383,0,t1_cw1lqf4,To me it sounds like its just an overgrowth of different bacteria. It takes a bit for everything to settle down and get balanced again. Just continue to eat a healthy diet avoid stress drink lots of water.  Weirdly what helped for me was stopping the probiotics and taking a tablespoon of unfiltered apple cider vinegar  times a day. But I dont really recommend natural remedies for people its inconsistent and its not really proven to be effective. So follow your doctors advice and try natural remedies after youve exhausted all your options.,WomensHealth,cw1yizd,1,t5_2rpzk

10928502,0,t3_5w3zhl,You could try ibuprofen it usually helps me. I know you said you cant swallow pills but could you maybe crush them and mix it in applesauce or something? Or maybe you could try eating the whole pill with applesauce. I used to have a hard time swallowing them and this would help me. Are you on birth control? I used to have really bad cramps before birth control and once I got on it I rarely have cramps and pains now. ,WomensHealth,de775db,2,t5_2rpzk

I have PCOS myself and a lot of what youre describing is what I go through a lot. For reference Im . My sister also has it shes . She was diagnosed much earlier when she passed out in a kmart but I was diagnosed by chance a month ago while an emergency room doctor was doing an abdominal CT scan and he noticed cysts on my ovaries. ,WomensHealth,dg5nmni,1,t5_2rpzk
