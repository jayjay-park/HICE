144025,0,t1_ceutdm1,Beasleys slump is in part a result of less play time. Every player needs a couple of minutes to find a rhythm. Jeez give him at least  minutes to take a couple of shots before benching him. And I believe that their perspective on not including Allen in the second half was that the coaches werent focused at all on the offense and only on improving defense which they failed at. The amount of  point shots that were left wide open in the second half was actually laughable. Most of them werent dropping for Atlanta but the wide open Kyle Korver  pointer at the end basically summed up the entire game for us. Bad defensive rotations  sloppy coverage  lack of communication   points scored on us.,heat,ceuu310,3,t5_2s8tk

Not trying to be pessimistic but this Heat team is really reminding me of the  Lakers. x champs who were playing uncharacteristically poorly especially against poorer teams I remember they lost to the same Cavs team they beat by  earlier.

Marginal Contact rules didnt exist in Jordans NBA and even then Lebron gets hammered on a consistent basis. The thing about Jordan and Im not taking anything away or even trying to stir this argument is that he wasnt some originator of this graceful style of play. Dudes had been doing crazy shit with style and grace for a while and theyll be doing it long after. MJs still one of the greatest ever and regardless of how much this old ass argument gets brought up its nothing but opinions but to flat out say Lebron couldnt play in the s or that he wouldnt have survived in Jordans game is just dumb to me. And honestly I think its safe to say Lebron could dunk from the free throw line while switching hands mid dunk.

And since it is in a bar with physical contact with other humans people will not troll and say the things they will online where anything goes.

1257954,0,t1_cib3hz8,Ooh personal attacks. I wouldnt say it was snobby. I just think that the series has done a lot of things that really undermines the stories. A lot of shallow things and a lot of unneeded things. Of course its never going to be perfect with  hours of air time per season but that doesnt mean every other remark Oberyn always makes should be about sex. Its something that bugs me a lot and undermines someone who can be made into a deep character with that screen time allotted. Ok heres a better reason. Something the show hasnt captured since season  is the subtlety of the words in the books. Things that arent captured in the show range from the history that the story is based on to the foreshadowing of what will happen to the visions and the symbolism associated with it and the actual content. In the books there are a ton of subtle things that you dont catch on the first read. For instance spoilers from this point on for those who arent current Barristan isnt revealed to be Barristan for quite a while. If youre attentive youll figure it out by a few clues here and there by the way he speaks before the reveal. The plotting isnt nearly as explicit as it is in the show too. Giving Maergary a POV was pretty weak imo mainly because youre supposed to figure out it was the Tyrells who poison Joffrey not be spoon fed it. The show is watered down from a mystery novel set in a fantasy world to an epic pew pew sex sex fest. Thats not snobby. Its what happened and  of book readers will tell you that. Now if thats your thing cool. There is sex and there are epic fights that only the book can capture due to budgetary constraints among other things but throwing it in  episodes weakens the story by sucking up air time away from something that can be more substantial. Yes sometimes it is used to advance the plot by throwing dialogue into it but it more so slows the show down. Now dont get me wrong I love the show. But only because I love the books. DampD didnt create the world theyre portraying it and are missing just as often they are hitting. If you had finished the rd book youd see why the finale is exactly what you want and why DampD really dropped the ball there. Yes the books will generally be better. Call it snobby if you want. Im fine but youre really missing out. If you read the books youll see that there are tons of areas for improvement. More so than you tthink. P.S. I think LoTR was handled as well as you can handle a whole series in  hours. ,heat,cib4v9p,0,t5_2s8tk

He could get big money somewhere and be irrelevant not making the playoffs he could get paid what he is now and move somewhere and maybe make the playoffs. Or he can stay in a city he seems to really love with his family and make some moves to help the team stay better. If Bosh plays the rest of his career in Miami he has a job waiting for the Heat anyway. Wade and Lebron will be doing other things in retirement. While I know Bosh is one of the smarter guys in the NBA and he will probably do very well once basketball is over he stays with the Heat he always has a back up plan of working for the Heat.

1824244,0,t1_ck9086e,I also thought this. But really Rice is Miamis first star. He was never an All Star with the Heat but he was the first Heat player to be known as a top scorer and deadly three point shooter. And he is the first player the Heat drafted that became an all star IIRC. Not as a Heat player though but a year after he got traded to the Hornets. He also won the pt shoot out in  in a Heat jersey. I think Ron was and still is more of a fan favorite and because he was the first ever draft pick by the Heat has more of an important role in Heat history but Rice was Miamis first true dynamic star player. And he lead them to their first two playoffs births. With help from Ron of course and Steve Smith in . I was too young but look on youtbue of highlights of the Rice Smith Heat teams that looks like it was a fun team to watch. And man was trading Smith a mistake.

Everyone else we just dont have the assets. It would be classless for the Heat to trade away guys that agreed to  year deals because they were on board with what the Heat were trying to do as opposed to going to another team and getting more years or more money. Only trade bait is Cole because he is expiring and it will relieve people of cap space I think lol. Rio is a real good trade bait but I dont know... Heat are loyal to him and he is loyal to us. And man seeing a possibility of us trading away EnnisNapier for a guy who probably wont resign with us is terrible.I always liked Enes Kanter would be nice to get him too off the bench.

If bosh needs to assist anything its better developing chemistry on highlow game with whiteside from the elbows. Bosh has never played with a true center in his career jermaine oneal is the closet but i believe they briefly played together on toronto. Looking at Kevin Love perhaps people start appreciating boshs sacrifice more and more and his ability to change his game to fit others.  I believe that is a large portion of his true lack of identity at PF position was caused by his abilities to do a little bit of everything.Looking at Aldridge and no reason why bosh couldnt be a PF anchor if he wasnt forced to blitz pick n roll coverages at the  and  and shoot s to space floor. ,heat,cojg4vj,9,t5_2s8tk

Third some of the Dewars club seats dont offer a good view of the action.Basically Dewars Club is for rich older men looking to impress a date or a business invite over dinner and a game where dinner and a game needs to happen all at once.My advice for ideal Heat game. Come early park by the Democratic Republic of Beer and hang there for an hour or so before the game.  Get into the AAA little early to watch warm ups haggle the other team.  Also the  level is really fun but if you can afford it sit in the lower bowl.Then afterwards go to Will Call for late night food.

Anyone major got hurt and all of a sudden our playoff chances are dampened.  Winslow and Richardson are all of a sudden frauds who are gonna be trash here on out.The reason this loss sucks ASS is because... Roy Hibbert played like fucking Kareem Abdul Jabbar and couldnt miss. Sloppy ass passes leading to turnovers that the Lakers exploited with ease. Playoff positioning on a night the Hawks lost that may cost us homecourt.This loss literally means NOTHING in the grand scheme of things. Ive been seeing shit spewed like somehow were gonna get crushed in the st Round or whatever. This loss is a fucking infuriating cause the Lakers are a trashass team and were a team fighting for seeding trying to upset Cleveland and or make the Eastern Conference Finals. No one got exposed or some shit. Winslow and Richardson played bad. Every garbage shot Hibbert threw up went in. Lakers played fucking volleyball with their fucking offensive rebounds. We lost an idiotic game and for that Im going to sleep pissed at AM. The referees didnt help with any of the frustration. JJ missing two fucking massive s didnt help.

After all the struggles weve had in the past few road games  BOS at end of season st few games in Charlotte Miami was able to play with the intensity needed to win on the road as well as the playoffs.  Dragic continued to play like he did in Game . He was carving up the defense. His jumpshot looked good tonight   pt shot. Hes looking like the the All NBA rd Team player that we wanted when we signed him. D Wade with the late game heroics OT. Thats what a team leader does especially to make a statement in Game .

9742469,0,t1_dady6tl,Eh.I think what we need to do is either develop a leader most likely going to be Winslow or sign an FA who can do just that. I prefer the former but thats just me.I dont think its the language barrier because Dragics english doesnt seem to be as bad as it was during his time in PHO but he doesnt seem like someone fit to be a leader or truly be lead.I dont see Hassan becoming a true leader even though I see him possible maturing into a pseudothird captain so to speak in his third of the contract but I think contrary to popular belief Whiteside can in fact be lead. Wade and Whiteside worked well together. And even though some felt that there was some rift forming between the two I highly doubt it. I think what Whiteside needs is a leader to follow and I think he can do that.And if we dont land a big or midtier FA this summer I think we will be more than fine and further let Winslow develop into one.But anyways...I still support Dragic not as much as I did a month ago but I do not think he is the leader our team needs. HOWEVER I still think we can do well efficiently with him for the remainder of his contract. But personally if we did for some reason trade him as sad as I would be initially I wont be as heart broken as I wouldve been a month or so ago.,heat,dadyzjs,1,t5_2s8tk

You can pitch your vision to them without the pieces in place but it helps to have attractive cornerstones they can visualize playing with.As for trades remember how we landed Zo? Or Timmy or Shaq? They were all is undesirable situations with their former teams. You target the team that might be willing to cash out for that player you want. I dont think a Cousins or AD are realistic.

Justise has now lost a years worth of training and is basically barely more than a  year player who specializes in defense just like Kawhi did.  Devin Booker was always a scorer.  We didnt need a scorer during our draft we had Bosh and Wade and we got the best defender in the entire draft at the time and still to this day.  Hes just hurt so he doesnt have the opportunity to get better and prove people wrong.  Im certain within  years he will be a  ppg player.

11585155,0,t1_dg942ka,Totally agree! Melo would spread the floor really well which play to Dragic and Whitesides strengths. Melos shooting would open the paint for Dragics driving and allow Whiteside to have less bodies in the paint. Please do not counter with Hayward can do that AND is  because I will counter with Melos contract will be  less than Hayward which would allow us to sign someone else now and open up possibility of signing a superstar in the future. Hayward is not a superstar or HOF talent. He is an Allstar with potential to be a superstar.,heat,dg96nd3,5,t5_2s8tk

11628004,0,t1_dge1crp,Well after the fact its hard to do stuff like that. The difference in those games means things play out differently. Also FTs werent the only thing. Heat also missed a lot of easy ones and s they made in the nd half of the season.  Also it did take a little while for multiple guys to play well together. I hated Dragic and Waiters on the court together early.  Dragic deferred too often. Ultimately if you take those factors and the injuries into account this is a  more win team at least. Just unfortunate circumstance. Even that knicks game. They won every important category that night but missed another  FTs and shot  from . Thats how you lose by  at home to the knicks without Melo or Derrick Rose ,heat,dge1ovl,1,t5_2s8tk

11661914,0,t1_dghvelz,You are the one with the problem. Youre the one with the shitty arguments. First its Hes too small and now its He can possibly be a Draymond Green but we cant expect it.Tell me when I said he should be the starting center? All I was trying to point out was that he can start and play against big man. He didnt just switch onto a center on one possession or some shit. Dont be dumb on purpose like that. Im reading your comments perfectly fine youre just making shit arguments. You know I tried to end this with a have a good night but you can fuck off.

11718620,0,t1_dgnzcfu,A lot of the fault also has to be placed on Hoiberg. The Bulls went on a big run in the rd quarter largely thanks to Robin Lopez dominating the Celtics inside. What does he do? He literally doesnt fucking play him in the th quarter. Another big reason for that run was Canaan. Hes the only PG they have that can defend and then Hoiberg takes him for way too long. I think the Celtics went on like a  run the minute MCW checked in. I dont get why he didnt stick with Canaan. This win could wrap up the series and prevent the momentum for getting out of hand. Who cares about rest just play Canaan for the rest of the game since its the only way the Bulls stay in the game. ,heat,dgoc1sl,3,t5_2s8tk
