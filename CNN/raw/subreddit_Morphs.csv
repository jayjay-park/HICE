8751484,0,t3_4zxscz,I used some fun techniques on this  Im starting to get into it.  But masking things out properly is a giant pain.  Which is why this one may demonstrate more technical knowledge but not be as good as yesterdays.My technique for masking is like so Track motion in Mocha AE Create bezier pathmask in Mocha AE link to tracked motion data then verify its tracked properly and the mask follows well. Copy the data back into AE using the Paste Mocha Mask option in the Edit menu.This is cool because it comes into AE as a real mask.  This is NOT cool because Mocha AE lets me apply feathering to only certain spline points but this doesnt seem to be carried over.  All I seem to get is AEs mask feathering which I can turn on in AE and is much simpler applies to the entire shape.My question is pretty simple  How should I be doing masking?  Bear in mind Im always going to prefer a faster lesswork intensive process like I used here to one that takes hours and yields perfect results.On a completely unrelated note this one was fun because I had to create a layer to fill in the data under the hand that doesnt exit the frame using Photoshop.  ,Morphs,d6zlbwp,2,t5_2vjd3
8759314,0,t1_d6zq4sp,Probably not but I still use Photoshop a fair bit  if you feel like you have some goodies to share I never mind hearing them.  ,Morphs,d70kopb,1,t5_2vjd3
