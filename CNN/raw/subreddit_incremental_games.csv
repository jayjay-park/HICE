414974,0,t3_1y30qu,Hi  played your game and I really like the concept of the checklists and making it jokey  this is a nice twist on the idle genre.  I also like how youre making it look stylish.  Some feedback after a while it gets difficult to keep track its very recursive of all the components youre trying to get together to achieve an objective and it just starts to feel really repetitive.  I think it would be more playable if from the start it was very easy to autoearn the lowest level components that youre using to assemble larger things.  Also the scrolling is frustrating as well  once you start having a couple plans going at once youre scrolling down each time you flip between PlansGadgets screens.

E.g. If your team was rated   and the oppositions   but your team had a good morale and theirs didnt then you could have a good chance of winning and vice versa.

889856,0,t1_ch5ejvb,gt Have an unlock for an autoclicker that you can upgrade.One semirelated point that a few games have similar features. Cookie Clickers primary building is a Cursor that autoclicks for you. But obviously thats just thematic flavoring. It is still treated separately from a click.But your idea is to explicitly make it an autoclick available from the actual game that would act exactly like a modded autoclick. Here are my opinions on that. Players are suckers for efficiency even if they accidentally ruin their own fun in the process. If someone who likes clicking sees an official autoclick featureupgrade they will feel obligated to use it.. Players who feel like okay using an autoclicker will have very little issue getting one working.. Therefore the only hazard here are players who dont like clicking but also dont like using modstools.My hunch is that it is much better to placate group  than group . And placating group  could be as simple as posting a blog article noting that rd party mods are aokay as long as you have fun and it makes you want to play the game more.But if you really want to run with the idea make a MetaIncremental Game that has little miniincrementals running on the screen and you get to purchase autoclickers that run against all them. It would be a fun amusing theme. gt Id like to join in on your game if youd like if you need music and sound effects that is. Message me if you would like for me to send you some links to some of my work.Sure. Its not at the point where graphics or music are feasible as Im still building the core engine and working on the fundamental layout. But when I get to the actual graphicsmusic work Ill send you an alpha link.But to be clear that is quite a ways off yet. I have the main game features split into two major parts. The current todo list is. Finish core engine Part A  complete. Finish layout for Part A  complete but without graphics. Start game mechanics design for Part B  complete. Code engine for Part B  complete but I should be able to reuse most of the code from Part A. Design layout for Part B  complete. Set up hosting backend and publishing strategy  complete but shouldnt take long for v. Add saveexportload feature  complete  hrs. Ping for Alpha testers and initial feedback on mechanics and layout. Begin graphicsmusic work  complete. Work out business plan e.g. ads  complete. Post publicbeta and ping rincrementalgames for feedback. ???So... Step  would be where Id swing by and drop you a message.

Different bananas to make the gameplay more interesting  Different bananas used for different things  Filling certain orders for some extra cash maybe a minigame this one will be especially hard for me Im a complete noob.

1138626,0,t1_chxhpsj,Well I was hoping to expand the worldview for people with this answer but I guess it came out too confusing. Think about what it means for something to be a game how about an incremental game? Havent we all at one point entered . into a calculator and kept pressing the  sign to watch the number go up? When we were young it was a curiosity as to why this happens the number goes up faster and faster but it was satisfying to set some goal and reach it... like hey I want this to end up being a  digit number or somehow end up at . That right there is pretty much a very basic form of an incremental game.Now there are lots of devs in this sub and lots of people who can become devs. I want there to be more game developers thats the only way this genre can grow. What Im trying to point out that the process of building a game can be a game. Ask any developer of your favourite incremental  whether it be Civ Clicker or A Dark Room chances are they had fun building it watching the game grow watching the number of players who enjoy their games grow. Each time they put out an update making their game a little better they get more people playing their games and that in itself is a reward.Basically what Im getting at is that building a game can be just as fun as playing a game because building is a game of its own. Theres no real rules just the limit of your imagination and abilities.And right now if you are upset because Im clearly being a smartass in mentioning a game that not everyone can play then I apologize  that was not my meaning. If you are interested in game development its really simple to get started but its not for everyone and unfortunately its not profitable... but hey youll get to have fun so why not learn a marketable skill while having fun without having to pay a single cent?,incremental_games,chxpfns,2,t5_2yia0

1749374,0,t3_2ebpa8,. Every game i play i make tons of calculations about to get best possible sequence of doing stuff. Thats what i like the most. Math and squizing every possible second from single playthrough.. I would say games with main focus on incremental with additional type of gameplay which rewards me more than totally idle player. . I dont think end game has place in incrementals. They are more about reset with profit and grind. The longer i can keep it up without getting bored the better.. For me incrementals are all about replayability. But only with reward system. Even simple like x to smth or more complex like unlocking new stuff.. I do BUT if the game is good i turn it off for specific page. Then i do whatever i have to do in the game and click on adds before going back to idling. Doesnt matter what the add is about.. No..  Clothes and mugs with funny or badass pictures related to the game.. Free with adds or  dollareuro without IF i would like the PC ver.. Android phonetablet.. Its relatively new genre so  of the games are alphabetagamma stage hence they change a lot requiring rethinking strategiesscrewing things up more often than i would like.

1765002,0,t3_2ep5zj,I for one immediately smelled a minor when I saw that game and was amazed at the vitriol in the comments. Reddit doesnt have time for people with thin skin it seems. I didnt expect so chanesque a reaction to someone who was obviously so new to development as to think that their OP was worth posting.  The game was bad and should never have been posted. The idea that takedown is equivalent to the user giving up forever rather than simply taking to heart that their contribution was bad is a very narrow view since I too have submitted things to places as a newbie been chewed out taken it down or had it removed administratively and had absolutely no problem dusting myself off and trying again from a place of greater context and experience. Therefore I cannot accept the interpretation that the game being taken down as a response to criticism is itself inherently bad.  I will say that a lot of comments went overboard and were not appreciative of the fact that not everyone immediately automatically understands game development including the level of development and contribution necessary to pass muster as any kind of original derivative work to a cynical internet audience. Did the games OP deserve criticism? Absolutely. But a lot of the comments went way too far and failed to understand how much the OP still needed to grok in order to understand what was wrong with their contribution and as a result reacted in far too an indignant and cruel manner.  So I guess my opinion is a little of column A a little of column B.,incremental_games,ck1mv3j,9,t5_2yia0

1897343,0,t1_ckh5121,Just some feedback  I think the game is an interesting start but after a combined  of play and having my account repeatedly hacked the interest is pretty much gone.Ill set up my experience first I was having a tough time figuring out what was happening at first the training helps but its not always clear where you go to do things. No big deal I managed to get myself set up with a decent cracker hasher hider and firewall but these were all deleted. After starting pretty much from scratch I made a point of deleting every single log file wherever I went.  I even deleted my own so people wouldnt be able to see where I had beenNow some commentary If you are going to make it so easy for people to hack into our systems consider balancing the game so that you can get started again fairly quickly.  Having to basically start from scratch downloading everything again waiting for the downloads to finish deleting log files etc  perhaps there is an anonymous server that can be set up rather than one that logs IPs.  That might make it a little easier for people to get started again. I never managed to get very far so I dont know is there a way to notify you when someone has logged into your computer?  Is that an upgrade?  If not it should damn well be. I know that upgrading your server makes certain actions faster net speed cpu etc but I started with a tiny amount of cash and wasnt able to upgrade anything but the very basics.  The startup time to get going is just SOOOO slow that you lose interest pretty darn fast.Overall I found the game engaging and interesting but the speed at which things happened was just unrealistic not that it has to be realistic but mostly boring.  I would suggest making it easier for users to start from scratch especially one they have been destroyed by some other player and now have to limp along with inferior software waiting ages for things to copy or download.  Otherwise I get the feeling you will end up with a game full of people with really highly tuned servers who just feast on newbies that are out of protection.  Those newbies get tired of having to start over and over and over again and give up.  Then you are left with a small number of superhackers and no one else playing the game  boring for the people who have invested the hours and are now those superhackers.Basically I am suggesting you rebalance the lower end of the game and give users a chance to get going again after being destroyed by someone.  Not necessarily so they are kicking ass again just so they can at least make some money and get back into the game.Edit I went back to the game just now to check up how it was going.  My server has been laid bare by someone so I started trying to download things.  I supposedly have MB left on my HDD but when I try to download a MB file onto it I get the error Insufficient Disk Space.  I can only imagine that I have a virus on the system taking up the required space.Thats all fine and good but at this stage of the game I have no way of removing the virus. I cant download software that will identify or remove it and any time I try anything I get hacked again and my account is deleted.Starting to feel like a waste of time.,incremental_games,ckhtj1n,4,t5_2yia0

1936108,0,t1_ckmgl3u,gtI liked the varied pitch of clearing tiles theres something tactileorganic feeling about it. That makes me super happy! The music the pink bonus makes when it appears is meant to be comforting and dancyflirty like the bonus acts then a sudden dull thud when you click it and it disappears. And clearing the screen reminds me of bubble wrap which isnt always the same sounds so the randomness helps with that I feel.Yep I wrote the bonus bonus music as a joke obviously but I liked it so much that I want everyone to experience the joke. You have a  chance of getting a bonus then another  chance of getting a bonus from that bonus. I wasnt sure how rare to make it but I think this works well as the people that play for a fair bit of time are likely to see it.My other games have music tracks in them and if you like it I have some more on my soudcloud Sorry for the long reply thanks for playing my game ,incremental_games,ckmhnuy,2,t5_2yia0

2161133,0,t3_2jrz8i,Sorry for repost but Im going to reiterate my point every time this question comes upAn incremental game has a focus on the incremental upgrades part. This is very important  the primary focus of the player is on getting the next upgrade or unlocking the next thing not killing people doing boss fights or  racing around a track.Call of Duty can be an incremental game however if we simply shift the focus  make the fighting part less active and moved towards an experience based completely off of the existing upgrades you have. Scope?  accuracy. Silencer?  chance of avoiding detection but leave the player themselves out of the combat so they can focus on getting the upgrades by completing missions and stuff.Like youve mentioned the numbers are all pretty important and there is a basic reward feedback loop that people really like thus its implemented in pretty much every game in the world. And so people could play those games as if it were an incremental if they manually change their focus from firing guns to numbers but the intention of the game itself is to make you think about positioning tactics etc. and the upgrades are useful but ultimately not the game defining characteristic.,incremental_games,clej2dx,6,t5_2yia0

While the idea behind incremental games is fairly simple and widespread the actual execution is wildly different and thats why this is an incremental games sub and not cookie clicker clone sub.For someone who has trouble with coding best I can point you to is to make your ideas as detailed as possible refine everything make diagrams to help you communicate and hope that a developer is willing to work with you to make it real.

To display changes on the screen the controller only updates a few times a second which means the controllers instance of foo is behind the true foo ergo the controllers foo.counter will be larger if the true foo.counter resets. I set ui bootstraps progressbars animate to false during those frames which successfully resets the bar to zero then set it back to true during the rest of the frames.Im honestly not sure if it actually did much for my bars that update every second but it was a fun hack.,incremental_games,copqq9b,1,t5_2yia0

Feedback is very valuable gtI just pushed a fix for hat I think was the biggest flaw of the day loop code. This may solve your problem.I have no way to measure performances globally yet and havent planned doing much about it until I move to a more sane client side architecture. But there may still be a few quickwins out there. Just let me know if this one did improve things.I have no idea whats going on with the leaderboard this is rather frustrating. I use the plain Google Play leaderboard api and it seems to behave that way  because people choose not to share theire scores. But I suspect there still may be some problem with auth that may interfere or something else Im doing wrong. I may fall back to some homemade highscores.Im collecting ideas for some HR tab your suggestion may fit in. Degradation of workforce over time is interesting.

4119828,0,t1_crpkmfa,For folks who like to  games including achievements or feats or what have you its really quite frustrating to see such unreasonably high numbers that would require constant attention to this one tab. None of the popups stay up for long enough to click if not actively paying attention and now that my Hamlets are automated theres no real reason to click any more than the five of those points that Ive already done. While they are being generated automatically and slowly the popup votes are infrequent and fleeting enough that Ive still not earned enough to buy a third manager slot... qqAnyway Im quite a bit farther in than when I made my last post  have just completed my first County  and apart from the popups Im really enjoying the game. Its pretty unique theres some real sense of progression and the settlement naming schemes are fun.My one other gripe is that the tier  prestige upgrades are soaking up most of my Hamlets resource production and I cant earn any income for myself without turning off all autobuys for individual Hamlets. I now know to avoid these upgrades for larger settlements but theres no way for me to get my bottomtier Hamlets back to maximum efficiency as in all tt buildings getting automatically bought as early as possible particularly the t Woodsmen for buy  of each building requirement.

4360737,0,t3_3aw5lz,Hello I would like to ask you guys a question. I want to add class system to my game. WarriorWizardNinja or we. There are few different ways for me to do this  . Level  you are a novice at lvl  you can pick a class maybe similar to other games where you can pick mage at lvl  other class at lvl  or upgrade your novice to something like super novice which increase level cap to  and let you pick even better class obviously it will be harder to level up.    . Each class have their own spellsskills to choose from not really what I want since I prefer if player can mix everything and create its own class    . Each class will give you certain bonuses to other spells. You can pick allmost spellsskills with all different classes but each class will give you a bonus to certain spells. Like wizard would increase effect of fireball giving it more damage or something.    . Multiple classes  This could be either something that allows you to play all classes and level them up separately outside of your main character level or it could be simply double class system which let you pick something like wizard  warrior and unlock bonuses from those  classes see point .    If you have any better ideas let me know   of my points above can be combined into  big system if there is a good way to implement this. Let me know what do you think.

4743455,0,t3_3fr6e7,Ill be honest right now it is little better than an under featured cookie clicker.  If I may put in my two cents perhaps some sort of progressive game play would be called for.  Maybe after so much water it opens up another section where say you grow plants and in order to keep the plants watered you have to keep a consistent water flow to plant growth ratio.  Then the plants could be used to increase plant growth increase number of plants unlock another tier where plants feed animals.  Just a few suggestions on ways that could potentially set it apart.  Best wishes with the development of this and hopefully we will see some new features in the near future.Bare minimum you have a functional game and that is more than can be said for a lot of the initial releases on this subreddit.   for now will drip again when updates are released.,incremental_games,ctsggxx,1,t5_2yia0

Im pretty sure the graphics and stuff are all the sameIn the Tapps games you have  upgrades  Auto delivery every  seconds  Auto delivery every  seconds  Increase quality chance  Collect coins while away  Upgrade tractor timeSome upgrades are limited and only have a couple of upgrades and some cost heaps of gems after the first few upgrades. Gems are hard to come by. Ads are everywhereIn Rabbit Evolution. IIRC each upgrade has  levels  Rabbit Delivery  Tractor Collect coins  Fusion Bar Doubles coins for X amount of time every Y fusions  Carrot Delivery Carrots give a buff depending on what one is picked up  Auto Open Box  Rabbit Magnet Auto fusion there is also Big Huge etc for each world  Crate Quality  Atomic Fever Increase Fusion bar bonus time All upgrades are purchasable with coins The game is playable without needing to buy gems. Gems are only used as an alternative for buying rabbits. Gems drop frequently from carrots. Ads arent as bad. ,incremental_games,ctyhy4t,1,t5_2yia0

It unfortunately doesnt seem to have offline progress though which kills any incremental as far as Im concerned.  I only played it for  minutes or so so if offline progress shows up after that then I would suggest that you at least let players know that that will happen because I think offline progress is a big deal for a lot of people.  I was also a little disappointed that the eight different autominers were exactly the same except for the very first level.

Its not done yet but I will be creating alternate ways to earn money other than the stock market the stock market itself will get an overhaul and ship building will also get an overhaul.

The game is pretty interesting to say the least and Id be silly if I didnt mention that literally any yahoo with the feintest idea on how to operate Unity could easily build the exact same game but better in about  weeks tops.You have machines that spit an ore that ore is physical and can follow a conveyor network the ore can be upgraded to give more money by certain special conveyor systems then it gets dumped into a furnace which turns it into money. There are like  different ore makers conveyors walls etc etc. Literally anyone with Unity could make this game and probably churn out a cult following.

If you could do something about the massive lag that happens when you try to upgrade all towers at once when you have a full screen of towers that would be great. Takes like  minutes of the towers slowly lvling while lagging before the game catches up.And my friend tells me some of the spells are too powerfull. Particularly the fire towers combined with the fires spell he tells me results in you being able to use the fire spell and continue to oneshot everything and prety much ignoring upgrading the towers as long as they set the enemies on fire.,incremental_games,d2juxle,2,t5_2yia0

Our first step as a team however is a bit more modest. We really enjoyed wasting our lives away on AdCap Also I learned some coding making Honey Clicker and it inspired us to make another incremental as a teambuilding exercise and a way to learn to work together.So DevClicker was born  Because we want everyone to be game developers! Its an idle clicker game inspired by AdCap. Start off as a lonely dev in a dark cellar and create your megaawesome gaming empire! Kind of loosely based on what we will doIve been roaming this sub for a while and would love your professional feedback on some stuff Visuals  Of course its only in early stages and UX in terms of some buttons not standing out enough etc will change but the general ideas should be captured in the screenshot. What do you think? Where to publish  Weve been thinking about different ways to get it out to players and right now weve decided on releasing it on Kongregate first and since were now using Unity release it on mobile platforms after that if theres demand. If thhee are other devs reading this what are your ideas and approaches?  Give us your ideas what you would like for this game to include. Currently it is a pretty standard system quite like AdCap but weve already got ideas how to diverge from that path. Any additional ideas would be extremely appreciated.Thank you in advance! If you like the idea follow us on twitter to see our progress and keep an eye out in here and in other similar subs.

8767413,0,t3_5026pk,I played a few incremental games and really enjoy the active clickers or hybrid games myself. My favorite so far stays Clicker Heroes.Heres an idea thinking further in the rpg hybrid direction not Clicker heroes specificallyWhen defeating enemies there is a certain chance they drop an ingredint.There are different rarities for all enemy types with custom drop chances.Goat Slime dropsCommonhairy goo droplet Uncommon horned slimeball Rare chunk of slimy ivoryVery rare ruminated golden slimeball .Legendary liquid bleating flux .Ghostly hoomanCommon unseen air Uncommon whipped ectoplasma Rare ethereal unshaken stir Very rare trustworthy agenda .Legendary comic sans .Yeah... So follow me for a second gt Combining  hairy goo droplets and  etheareal unshakenStir would result in a  time use Skillability that would allow say...  seconds of  click damage.There you have it. An alchemy element within a clicker! Marvelous right?I mean its fun because its random it adds to the wonder of discovery part and gives a whole new twist to strategic clicking if certain recipes involve the use of similar ingredints magic!So theres a lot more where thus came from blatantly ripping assets from other games and forcing them in thus genre.Thing is...

8817550,0,t1_d77gjm5,Relatively heavy logic  times a frame before CPU is substantially affected sounds nowhere near accurate.  As an example Rimworld AI is a bottleneck on performance for even very strong CPUs.  It cant handle too many AI characters like  each with their individual control.  But I dont think its close to say  heavy logic chains a second.Of course I never avoid division if it is appropriate although if it is arbitrary whether I multiply or divide I will use multiplication in code.  The difference is quite large even though it probably wont make any significant difference in performance in the end but I see no reason to add extra cycles unnecessarily.  ,incremental_games,d77qzzl,1,t5_2yia0

Im not about to have a pissing contest with you but seriously grow the fuck up.Youre a programmer who wouldnt even consider game development as a hobby. Good for you. Your experience coding applications must give you the authority to speak so definitively about game design so I guess you must be right and the thousands of people who have enjoyed Nidhogg Spelunky Hyper Light Drifter and Hotline Miami to name a few are wrong. No wait theyre idiots according to you. Because obviously those games are crap and they should be ashamed for playing them right? Theyre all just hipsters who wanna be retro and that must be the sole reason they play games to begin with. Because having fun is not as important as demonstrations of technology. I bet your favorite games must be those benchmark programs huh? Which is your favorite  Unigine or DMark?I dont know of any D games that dont look retro because thats kinda the nature of a D game. Does that mean they should be boycotted? Are you saying that only D games are worth playing? How absurd. Also I can only think of one incremental that has a D look to it.

9707057,0,t3_5e167l,Amazing game.Took me a few minutes to understand it but once I got into it I quickly realised the depth of the gameplay with automation and crystal customisation.What I didnt get how infusion works maybe some other players can help me there and how mana flow consumption priority is computed.What it lacks for me a simple introduction to the different concepts some visual cues to differentiate crystal tiers and some visual cues to show when a crystal is using all mana flow and preventing others to use it the same way crystal turn reds when you have no mana left.Once again kudos for what youve accomplished so far and thank you for letting us try it before completion.,incremental_games,da9lprh,10,t5_2yia0

10367211,0,t3_5odeep,Usually I would recommend HTML  JS for an incremental but seeing that you are dead serious about going pro learning Unity would be much more valuable.The problem is that Unity has a much bigger learning curve than HTMLJs. I have experienced both and my productivity with Unity was much lower since I ran into so many problems for a very simple GUI.So basically you have two problems here learning the tech and learning to make games.A compromise would be to start making a game prototype in JS and learning to use Unity itself. I would recommend going through tutorial and sample games before trying to make something from scratch yourself.,incremental_games,dcj6oyf,3,t5_2yia0
10370612,0,t1_dcjfqoo,Disclaimer Im not the producer on this game so dont quote anything I say as officialIn general my philosophy is to make it just annoying enough that it is clear that youre not supposed to be doing it. If someone is inclined to hack the game making it hard to do so is unlikely to stop them. And even if we can stop them entirely I doubt that would then get them to spend some money in the game. So why get into this war of escalation instead of just ignoring it? Lots of idle games can be hacked but people who like the game often dont and will opt to support the game financially instead. Its worth noting though because the game isnt multiplayer if someone hacks it really doesnt hurt anyone else. This is definitely not the case for multiplayer games but those often require internet connections partially to deal with this.,incremental_games,dcjkk6w,3,t5_2yia0

The image of a question mark doesnt seem to be showing for some reason.  Basically the deal is that if you boost you can your extra  percent but it every time you earn money it could possibly shut down all profits from the thing you have boosted. Here is a situation where that is very bad for you.You boost ore extractors to get an extra  percent and are very happy with yourself. Then the facility breaks down and goes into repair modeno profit for a while.  While it is in repair mode a market event happens that gives you a x boost on ore extractors.

So far I havent changed my loadout at all because I have only unlocked  new spells. Critical raids do NOT appear every day I wonder if I need to reload the game for it to work.All in all quite a nice game but I wish I could interact with it in a more meaningful way.
