1658075,0,t3_2damp9,Ive been using R for  years everyday and about three years ago switched to using just . Ive never encountered a single problem for it although I never do strange assignments like thekcchief exampled. I find it reduces my chance for errors  I only have to get one character right not two.,Rlanguage,cjo5w0z,1,t5_2sbkr

2287850,0,t1_cltv9wk,Yes! They are different so let me comment with the results    x  c    gt xduplicatedx       I now see what values were duplicates and how many of each. If Im just interested in the actual values then I can do     gt uniquesxduplicatedx      If you havent used dcast but find yourself manipulating data frames a lot I cant recommend it enough. Its a super powerful way to perform aggregations. In this case I do the following    gt my.df  data.frameX  x    gt occurrences  dcastmy.df X  .                          value.var  X functionx lengthx    gt occurences      X .                                  gt occurrenceswhichoccurrences  gt        X .            The occurrences data frame shows each value of X  through  in the column labeled X and the number of times each X value occurred in the column labeled . to the side of it. Rownumbers which happen to also be the unique names are shown on the farleft. In the subsetted version Im taking only the rows of occurrences which have more than  occurrence.Lets break down a dcast a data.frame my.df a formula Independent variable  grouping value.var the dependent variable which in this case is X function I used the length function wrapped in an anonymous lambda but that was an unnecessary stepSo given a data set that was a little more complicated say mtcars I could do the following    gt headmtcars                       mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb    Mazda RX         .       . . .

In each cell of the table Im going to find the mean miles per gallon of cars which belong in that group. NaN means that no cars of that exact combination exist.If you dont want to group along the columns then you can use the period . just like in lmX  . data  my.df to specify that you just want the direct aggregations over your independent variable.    gt headiris      Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species              .         .          .         .  setosa              .         .          .         .  setosa              .         .          .         .  setosa              .         .          .         .  setosa              .         .          .         .  setosa              .         .          .         .  setosa    gt dcastiris Species  . value.var  Petal.Length mean         Species     .         setosa .     versicolor .      virginica .,Rlanguage,cluhtvd,2,t5_2sbkr

3417900,0,t3_2wz076,It is great that R Studio is supporting vim key bindings however the biggest complaint I have is the lack of key binding modification. What I wouldnt give for the ability to setup emacs text navigation in R studio. Just the basics ctrlfbnpae as well as deleting with ctrldk. I dont need all of the emacs functionality just enough so that I can use the editor without muscle memory bringing everything to a infuriating halt. ,Rlanguage,cphv5k5,1,t5_2sbkr
3575011,0,t1_cpzr4tk,I work in healthcare reimbursement and Rshiny is like a godsend for me. I deal with thousands of files from dozens of different data management systems each one unique and we have a very real need for our tools to be webenabled.Python worked great mainly because of Pandas but even Rshiny makes Pythonflask look like a maintenance nightmare from the PoV of how quickly we need to turn data around. Imagine being a data analyst and having to write javascriptcsshtml as part of your workflow. Its fun but its the most wasteful counterproductive use of time in the world. And pandas can be an absolute nightmare for importing raw data into an RDBMS mainly because of how it insists on type inference. The hacky type inference part of Pandas is so bad. Not everything that has numbers and a decimal point is a float and I dont have time to sit there and hold its hand and define hundreds of unique columns to it. dtype doesnt even work with fwf in pandas have to run zfill transform application on every row that doesnt want to cooperate. I thought part of the Python philosophy was that explicit is better than implicit.The job I inherited was done in handrolled PHP. Imagine that. After turning literally thousands of lines of PHP into hundreds of lines of Python into dozens of lines of R Im about to go get a freaking R tattoo.Its like bringing a panzer to a snowball fight every other firm in the region is still using Excel.,Rlanguage,cpzs1p5,2,t5_2sbkr

5636408,0,t1_cwvgkps,Ok so I think I may have found the problem. When I do strtrainingdata it tells me  of the  variables are factors with  others being ints. Do you think that may be the issue?EDIT I added in colClassesfactor when reading in the file and that seems to resolved this problem. But now its giving me a warning message that say In check.datadata allowed.types  discrete.data.types   variable OpptyID has levels that are not observed in the data.

8016033,0,t1_d4h2cps,Yes its a very strange object! I initially tried as.matrix but that came with a few problems itself such as s on the diagonal which would complicate finding the minimum. I guess I could grab the min distance from the dist object and then try to find it in the as.matrix version but yes it seems needlessly complex. There is a solution provided in this thread that works I just have to test it for multiple mins and higherdimensional data.,Rlanguage,d4h2rqn,1,t5_2sbkr
8518616,0,t1_d66df96,Yeah thats a good place to start.

10145703,0,t1_dbts53v,So here is the easiest way to get a sense for your problem. Look at the crosstabs for each level of the factor and your outcome. How many cases fall in the off diagonals? If its a fairly small amount for one or two factors then that could give you a sense of which factor categories are giving you trouble. If its isolated to one or two categories break the variable down into dummies and just exclude the problematic categories. If this is just an assignment your instructor should understand. If this is for an RampR or something more professional however you probably should include the variables. Particularly if they are correlated with your variable of interestare your variable of interest. You can have more than one predictor for Bayesian logits. The syntax changes according to the package so just experiment with which one works best. Again penalized MLE is a fairly common solution too. That Zorn article I attached walks through it I think. ,Rlanguage,dbtzlfl,2,t5_2sbkr
