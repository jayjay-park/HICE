4736290,0,t3_3fs98o,Here are some changes Id like to see   Make deagle a one shot kill on long range again.  revert the mas dropoff nerf Id rather like to see a Ma buff because the AK feels a lot stronger compared to the two   Tagging I havent really tested this properly but fast guns and weapons with low damage should have much lower tagging values than weapons like rifles and snipers.

4744504,0,t3_3fs33c,maybe make it like in . where it didnt matter if you had the silencer or not and the gun was the same,CSGOWeaponBalanceMod,ctsl8gl,2,t5_392tq
4845245,0,t1_cu59f7e,i presented counter points to almost every single point you made backing everything im saying with actual real life statistics from pro playersyou present a completely opinion based argument tec is op and i counter point by saying i dont think that and you think im wasting your time?do you believe everyone who disagrees with you is wasting your time?stick to using the upvotedownvote arrows dont bother posting. youre not very good at it.,CSGOWeaponBalanceMod,cu5a2mv,1,t5_392tq
6798674,0,t1_d0mjtmf,Oh interesting. However would it possible to make the changes to just one particular gun? Specifically the awp and the reduction in the scoped movement speed. Next is sort of unrelated to your weapons mod but Ive been searching for an answer forever and itd mean so much to me and to my friends if you could answer it.Is there any way to create a dedicated csgo server for our version of the game?Currently we host the server on the lan by starting offline with bots and svlan . However only the server host gets skins on his weapons. The rest can see that skin but when they buy their own gun they dont get them. Ive read that starting a dedicated csgo server might fix that issue.. Ive gone through the valve documentation for it but it doesnt seem like it will work for our version due to the difference in the files.One last question when we host servers like above on the intranetlan they dont show up in browse community servers. Is there any way to make them show up there?Thanks again!  ,CSGOWeaponBalanceMod,d0mx7e8,1,t5_392tq
