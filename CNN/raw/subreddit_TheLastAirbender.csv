Plus I wouldnt have to worry about drowning due to the neat airwater bubble trick.On the other end of it theres also Bloodbending assuming I had Amons power level I could use it for self defense or simply just for the hell of it.Also I live around lots of snow.

54562,0,t1_cekg3yb,Bringing in capital does not equate to success. If you put blinders on that have you only look at the brass tax and say that well it made money i.e. it must have been successful! then sure. You can make the argument that it was successful. But first of all that wasnt the only thing they wanted to do with The Last Airbender. Paramount Pictures wanted to make it into a trilogy. So they lost out on roughly  because they first film was so bad. And even if you watch The Last Airbender out of context it is still a terrible movie. The casting is awful the acting is deplorable even when you consider that it was mainly first time child actors the pacing is weird and doesnt work well it is far to short of film  minutes for such a long journey to take place the D was unnecessary crude and didnt work either. There is nothing redeemable about the film even when you dont think about how they butchered great source material.Im sorry to say but you are the one with blinders on acting like the fact that it made money means it was successful.  ,TheLastAirbender,cekn45c,2,t5_2rybx

122420,0,t1_cescwjn,I never said she had to be anything like Aang in fact I completely believe that her personality is actually acceptable to me. What I dont like and nobody can take this away from me or deny its truths is how fastpaced the God damned forsaken story is told as well how completely undeveloped the character development as far as progression goes with the story that the other characters are not just Korra. Everyone can down vote me as much as they want just dont be mad when somebody finally says the truth and points out the negatives that totally has the grounds and all the room in the world to speak that is worthy to mention.Im just saying if they were really serious about pumping out a new Avatar story arc with a new avatar they couldve at least put in some thought into telling the mother fucking story and more creative than this.Please anybody who wants to try debate this with me at least first acknowledge my points before submitting a comment for discussion. You cant deny what Ive said to be false or stupid. At least give me that much credit.Im a huge fan of the Avatar series so dont get me wrong. SOME people are bound to find disappointments in sequels if anything at all understand that much.I want a good story in anything worth my time I want good character development if I tried to write halfassed stories with bad character development like Legend of Korra back in highschool I would have been given an F. Just because a company had the funds to pump this trash and garbage out over the air waves doesnt mean that the story I couldve come up with if given the chance wouldnt have been either better or worse. And I could have definitely in my opinion been able to make Legend of Korra story and character development way better. Just saying.TLDR  If I had written the Legend of Korra story and tried to pass it off as one of my Written Tests that my Writing teacher has in high school I wouldve failed and gotten no praise. ,TheLastAirbender,cesddqm,-3,t5_2rybx

214501,0,t3_1wkdv2,I think Tenzin taught her how to control it and shes more willing to be the avatar than Aang was so she might have less trouble with making the same sort of sacrifice that Aang had to make put his avatar duties above his love for KataraI think Korras avatar state was weaker At the start at least she was quite strong at the end of season  because she isnt very experienced yet of course Aang wasnt very experienced either but the difference is that Aang wasnt in control of his actions while in the avatar state Until the final episode so he didnt rely on his own experience while in the avatar state but Korra does.  I think Korras avatar state will be a lot more powerful next season because shes gained a lot of experience last season and that was already very noticeable.,TheLastAirbender,cf2vjxy,5,t5_2rybx

I would think Air specialization would be something along the lines of vacuuming the air away from somebody Somebody please come up with an awesome name  But you also have to realize the spiritual side of bending.  Before the fire nation attacked everyone born an air nomad was an airbender.  Every. Single. One.  The only nonbenders were in the other nations and kingdoms.  This had to do with the Air Noamds being in touch with their spirituality more than the other nations and kingdoms.  As such their spirituality would definitely be at odds to kill.  You can see Aangs anguish on just the thought of having to kill Ozai.  So while the specialization can exist the morality of using the special bending would not even be a second thought.  So I think that it exists but since they dont even believe in killing its not a move they would even contemplate let alone create.Also I see uTechopath mentioned Gyatso and that is a valid point to bring up.  I was reading somewhere that this asphyxiation by vacuuming out the air was a possible move he could have used to kill that many firebenders.  However I have a counter argument that would go along with my theory that he would not even think about using it.  He probably taunted them and played with them evading like a true airbender in order to buy the other airbenders time to escape.  He brought them to an enclosed space and then was probably going to surrender or even just knock them out to escape again but some dumbass firebender tried to burn him.  Enclosed space  oxygen rich  defensive airbending  a lot of dead people.  the explosion pushed gyatso back to the wall and the firebenders away from him but all of them were burned. Just my take but thats how I like to think he went out a hero that did not kill anyone or himself on purpose,TheLastAirbender,cfz7tsh,5,t5_2rybx

Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose. The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible the source of the practices Tibetan name. In much of Tibet and Qinghai the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional Buddhist practice of cremation In the past cremation was limited to high lamas and some other dignitaries  but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to its increasing use by commoners. gtgtImage from article iInteresting Sky Burial | Charnel ground | Kapala | Funeral Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgmi oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgmi.

I want to see how theyve evolved over the  years between ATLA and LOK. Weve already seen how the Northern Water Tribe and the Southern Water Tribe have evolved tremendously. Ba Sing Se could be exciting. I want the obvious issue of Korra losing all contact with the previous fucking Avatars to be addressed. minirant here has to be done. You dont just completely shatter the mythological foundations for your show and then just go Oh well new age new era lets move on. No. While the Avatar Spirit is in every Avatar each Avatar is still a different person and I believe it is possible for Korra to go into the Spirit World and reconnect with them. It wouldnt be hard for Bryke to write this. I just cant accept the thought of Aang and all the other past Avatars being discarded like theyre meaningless when its completely unnecessary. You shouldnt have to discard the mythological foundations of your show just to show the audience that the present Avatar is important. If you have to do that then youve got a shitty character to begin with. rant over..sorry about that. Korra  Asami friendship and a final end to the love triangle stuff. Actual character development for Bolin. Give him a purpose outside of comic relief and pointless side stories. More stuff from the old gaang. Even if its just little bits and pieces that remind us of them. I dont know when it comes to ATLA I just cant let go. ANYWAY YEAH.

1322947,0,t1_cii9ja8,Season  shows a boat just like every other seasonWe see Korra and Asami talking atop a submarine.  Korra I...  Asami I...  You go first.  The conversation goes on with Korra saying Everything is going to be different from now on isnt it?  Yes it is.  Korra then looks worried and asks Asami What I if things dont work out?  What if the spirits and humans dont get along?  Asami responds Korra dont say that.  Of course youll  And Korra interrupts her with a kiss walks away back into the submarine Asami blushing intensely.After this event the episode finishes and episodes go on for a while.  Unfortunately the spirits and humans ARENT getting along and throughout the next  episodes Season  Episode  is when there seems to be some tension when Asami goes off to do an mission of some sort with Mako and Korra keeps trying to make hints at Asami but continues to fail.The next episode halfway through watching a play of Aangs adventures on Ember Island Korra approaches Asami who looks beautiful looking out at the water on a pier.  Korra is thinking about how Aang and Kataras actorsactresses are acting together despite knowing the two get together in the end but thinking the play will still end with them being just being friends like sister and brother.  Asami is that really how you feel about me?  What do you mean Korra?  That were..  Friends and nothing more..  That were like sisters but we would never be lovers..  We kissed and I thought wed be together but were not.  Asami responds troubled saying how she never felt that way but because of all the confusion of spirits and humans that it isnt the right time for a relationship.  Well when is the right time?  Korra asks.  Asami frowns on the verge of tears and says Im..  just a little confused right now...Korra kisses Asami and Asami frustratingly says I just said that I was confused!  and walks back inside crying.Asami feels miserable for the next episodes regretting what she had done.  Her misery leads to her becoming careless with her actions always making a small clumsy mistake while preparing for missions.  One time the mistake happens at the worst possible time and Korra gets injured badly.  In the midst of battle Asami quickly grabs Korra her heart racing knowing it was her fault Korra is on the verge of death.  Asami takes Naga and takes Korra to safety in a cave far from civilization.For the final couple episodes Korra gets better Asami and her bounce ideas off each other but the longer Asami spends time with Korra the more miserable she feels about what went on and how she rejected her.  There are many hints at Korra doing actions that suggest she had other intentions initially but did not because she did not want to offend Asami.The last episode Asami comes out with Korra.  Korra works things out. Everyone is celebrating and relaxing in a tea shop in the Earth Kingdom. The fans are noticing that there is only  minute left in the entire season.  uslyfox is freaking out.  rkorrasami is freaking out.  IM freaking out.Then within the last  seconds we cut to Korra and Asami looking at each other blushing on the balcony away from everyone.   seconds left.  They hug.  rkorrasami and rthelastairbender are now both biting their fingernails off panicking that there are only seconds left from the best thing ever or biggest disappointment ever.In the last  seconds of the season we see Korra and Asami embrace and kiss and the season ends.  I would need a hospital from having a pleasurable heart attack and everything would be good in the world for eternity.The end.Source that this is how its gonna be.

1341212,0,t1_cikhpg1,Taken from the bloggt The Hawkeye Initiative uses Hawkeye and other male comic characters to illustrate how deformed hypersexualized and impossibly contorted women are commonly illustrated in comics books and video games.gt This leads me to  propose the Hawkeye Test.  If your female character can be replaced by Hawkeye in the same pose without looking silly or stupid then its acceptable and probably non sexist.  If you cant then just forget about it.The point is to show that women are oversexualized by replacing the female character with a male character. And this is a fallacy because again male characters are not drawn that way when they are intentionally sexualized. The assertion that those poses are ridiculous because it looks strange for a man to be making them is not logically correct.Honestly I find the whole thing pretty reprehensible. Its basically shaming some boy reading comics because he enjoys seeing sexy female characters because apparently sexy female characters are inherently something sexist towards women. Yet female targeted fiction is filled with sexualized male characters but no one is shaming any girls for enjoying them.,TheLastAirbender,ciki2rp,10,t5_2rybx

1388322,0,t3_2a01qe,The problem is that Aang brings a lot of baggage with him that Roku did not. We never really knew Avatar Roku. He didnt derail the series with our interest in him. There was no clamoring to know what happened to Roku or his group of friends after the events of his first major character arc. Aang and his closeness to the new series seemed to set some strange expectations for the series that it would allow us to see more into the lives of the past Avatar and his companions when thats really not what this show is about. Its about a new Avatar and her friends and any connection to the old series is a matter of maintaining a consistent milieu. There are a few pieces of fan service here and there Admiral Iroh whatup but that fanservice cant be the main drive of the new show. People were much more interested in Aangs life than they were in Korras and this was the solution they came up with for that problem. I would love to see Korras connection to her past lives reestablished but only as a driving character point for her the realization that she can handle her own problems but its her connection to people alive and dead that makes her the Avatar that makes her powerful that gives her own life meaning. Korras a fiercely independent headstrong character and I hope that her character arc involves her learning a deep powerful spiritual connection to the people of the world. If they reconnect her with her past lives so that Aang can give her the information she needs to solve her problems I think it will undermine a lot of what her character has learned and hopefully will learn over the course of the series.,TheLastAirbender,ciqb3m5,38,t5_2rybx

1459674,0,t3_2aupjo,gt But lets consider what other types of technologies use magnets to accelerate objects to high speeds  railguns.Actually a projectile weapon based on magnets would not be a railgun. Railguns use electricity to propel their projectiles not magnets. Because electricity and magnetism go hand in hand yes there are magnetic forces involved in the operation of a rail gun but those magnetic forces are generated by flowing currents not actual magnets.The closest things we have to magnetbased projectile weapons are coil guns but they use electromagnets which arent actual magnets but instead a bunch of wires with electricity flowing through them. If the electricity goes off they stop being magnets.But then again maglev trains dont use actual magnets either as far as I know but instead use electromagnets. Since Varricks building them anyway I guess its safe to assume that by saying magnets he means electromagnets as well and under that assumption coil guns are within the realm of possibility. Kind of.The problem with projectile weapons that rely on electromagnets and therefore electricity is that you need a method to store a whole lot of electricity and then let it out super fast. In other words in order to create electricitybased projectile weapons you first need to be able to create highperformance capacitors and theres no indication that such things are available in the Avatar universe just yet. But then again they could just invent them or ignore the requirement  it is fiction after all. So make of it what you will.In any case though if they make a magnetbased projectile weapon it wont technically be a railgun. It will most likely be some type of Gauss gun coil gun.EDIT Although theres one thing Varrick could do with magnets that would have a fairly huge impact. He could invent steampowered power generators like the ones we have in the real world that spin a magnet inside a coil of wires with turbines to generate electricity.

1531568,0,t1_cj88te8,gtYoure not even remotely on base here. What you said barely makes any sense at all.Yeah that was the point.. it was directly reflecting what you said.gt Both Su and Aiwei have a background with the desert people  or at least some connection through themAs i said Mako and Bolin both had association with the Triads that doesnt make them in league with the triads. Asami has blood connections to equalists she wasnt an equalist. Asami literally hired the triads at one point she gave them vehicles does that mean she supports what they do? fuck no. Also what is this point even meant to mean? Of course Su and Aiwei have connections otherwise they wouldnt know each other.. he wouldnt live in her city this literally just falls down to She knows a red lotus.gt Su constantly talks about a new era and social evolutionYeah and shes built her own damn society built on completely different social order thats a pretty big new era. Her daughter is also an air bender another new era. Lots of reason to talk about new eras.gt and she has a criminal back ground.As i pointed out this isnt new among any. She shows absolutely no signs of those pasts now.gt the company she could have easily made duringMako and Bolin say hi.. and from what weve seen her crime life doesnt even last into her late teens shes shipped away well before then.gt Suyin doesnt seem to think crime is inherently badIt seems more accurate to say that she doesnt think that people who commit crimes are inherently bad if it was just that crime isnt bad she wouldnt make such a big deal about people turning around. and how people change.gt She has an obviously skewed perspective on what constitutes a crimeAgain she was a child when her view was skewed not as an adult. people change turning around etc.gt Mako and Bolin committed crimes to survive and both seem fully aware that what they did was bad.This is a bit more complicated. Mako and Bolin did indeed do bad things but you cant say that it wasnt until later that they came to regret them. You cant say they hated it as they did it. You cant even say they wouldnt do it again because Bolin totally goes back in for more money to get into the tournament. And before you say its not a crime its just guard work thats literally just as bad as saying its not a crime its just a driving job.. theyre right there on the same scale.gt Asami tazes her own fucking father when she finds out how deep his is in his criminal enterprise. And Su condemns what he did and sends out guards to look for him.gt Why are you ignoring legitimate signs that Suyins character might not be so redeemed?Because there are literally not legitimate signs that she might not have redeemed the only thing that seems to have been put to support it is Well what if she didnt and then a bunch of speculation based off her preredemtion life.gt what is keeping you from just admitting that she might not be?The fact that theres literally nothing suggesting that notion. Not even the slightest bit suggests it outside of her being a different person previous and having that past is not any sort of evidence suggesting it wasnt redeemed.,TheLastAirbender,cj89bmr,5,t5_2rybx

I think the message they were trying to send was that the problems of the non benders would be better solved diplomatically rather than militarily and by stealing peoples bending. I think it would send a worse message to kids to support the terrorist methods of Amon. The problem is not that he lied about not being a bender and manipulated people the problem is that he tried to drag benders down to their level by stealing their bending rather than peacefully improve the conditions of non benders. I think in this he shares many characteristics with Magneto.,TheLastAirbender,cjdbrwr,1,t5_2rybx

1575208,0,t3_2c8ino,Hahahahaha. I saw this topic yesterday and knew that when I came back to it today that it would be showered in downvotes. The users of this subreddit dont want to discuss this show they just want to have a circlejerk about how great they believe it is.Ill start by addressing the posts about Iroh since thats what you were downvoted the most for. In an attempt to make ATLA look just as flawed as TLOK we have posts saying that Iroh was a Mary Sue and was never wrong. Anyone who says that clearly didnt watch the show at all and would have completely missed the emotional moment where they take back Ba Sing Se. I will ignore the back story of Iroh just to show that in the series itself Iroh is flawed. The whole first two seasons Iroh is trying to do everything he can to get out of the war. He even tries to force this on Zuko by trying to get him to be happy with working at the tea shop and nothing more. While yes it is better for Zuko to be giving up his chase of the Avatar Iroh forcing this life on Zuko is ignoring Zukos wish to be a leader. It is when Iroh is finally in jail that he realises hes made mistakes and that he cant take a passive role in the war anymore. He figures out that his role in the war is to help bring balance back by gathering the White Lotus. This is his redemption which means that yes he made mistakes like everyone else.As for Tenzin up until the point where Korra told him to go away he had been the ONLY voice of reason in the show. At the end of Season  we get the idea that Tenzin was making progress on being a teacher as his relationship with Korra had grown. Now the only way to justify Korra ditching him is to make the assumption that both Korra and Tenzin had regressed for no reason. This is bad writing. At this point she shouldnt be angry about being locked up she should be thinking why did this guy who I am now close friends with make this decision when I was younger?Youre right though in how you say the lack of a clear goal has dropped the shows quality. Now theres nothing wrong with there being a story without a clear goal but that rarely works for an adventure type show. Usually the ones that do work will have very few main characters to make sure the story has a focus. In TLOK we have a huge number of characters that were supposed to invest ourselves in yet theres not much time for it and for the most part is lowers the importance of each character to the show. Since Season  Mako Asami and Bolin have been relegated even further to being the random sidekicks that really have no impact on the plot. For example the investigations Mako made in Season  ended up being pointless since it appears Varrick is free now and facing no punishment for no reason. Recently we had an episode focussed on Lin. My question is why? She was absent for most of Season  and had only just shown up in Season . While the episode wasnt a bad one it didnt serve any purpose to developing the main characters of the show nor did it have any relevance to the plot. Theres a possibility for it to have purpose but at the moment it seemed like a way to provide fan service for people who can say OMG LIN WENT THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE ZUKO!! THEY STILL REMEMBER ATLA GUYS!!Wans story worked because there was a goal and there were very few main characters. Theres Vaatu Raava and Wan. Thats it. Its a tight story and it was fairly awesome.Now we have even more characters being given time such as Jinora and Kai. All its doing is taking more focus away from what the show is supposed to be about the development of the Avatar. The bad guys havent done anything special that makes them unique. Theyre just generic bad guys at the moment. If they were to kill either Mako or Bolin or Asami right now it would barely matter.Oh and as for filler episodes. The filler episodes in ATLA still served a purpose. Since Aang is like us new to the current world of ATLA these filler episodes helped develop the world for us and let us see how Aang was learning to deal with it. Everything that happened to ATLA could be directly related to Aang. In TLOK there are episodes which arent meant to be filler but they become filler because their plot ends without resolution eg. Mako investigating Varrick. In those episodes none of it relates back to Korra at all.Anyway dont worry about downvotes you keep on posting!,TheLastAirbender,cjdq7jj,2,t5_2rybx
1575478,0,t3_2c8ino,Thats kind of the running theme behind Korras character. She doesnt run away from the role of the Avatar but she is still learning what it means to be the Avatar.Aang was the opposite.And the theme of the entire show is that the world has changed or is changing.Every single book has culminated in a massive change for Korra or the world.

All the build up and details showing the character of the Earth Queen along with the ideals of the Red Lotus makes me think this final arc moving back to Ba Sing Se is leading to the overthrow of the Earth Queen.

1583026,0,t3_2c76ol,I love the series overall the animation the storytelling the universe that has been built everything. However there are some personal changes I would have made who wouldnt have a few. Book One was great it was really a great establishment for what the new series is not ATLA but still similar basically. First and foremost and this goes for all the seasons of LOK aswell make the characters more than characatures the best thing about ATLA was the depth each and every character had. Bolin is the funny guy Mako is the conflicted love interest Tenzin is the wise father figure and lets not even get started on some of the more minor characters Meelo. hell Korra Lin and Asami were the only really well developed characters and Asami and Lin only got theirs near the end of the Book. Even Amon and Tarrlok were just power hungry Amons purpose was never completely clear as why he wanted to take everyones bending but one could assume it was power individuals sent on this quest by some influential past figure enter Yakone.A few nitpicks here and there are the fact that Dante Basco is far too ingrained in the viewers minds as Zuko added that Basco doesnt have much range in pitch that him voicing the  year old General Iroh II just doesnt work as well as it should. The I love you shared between Korra and Mako is bull and I think even the writers knew that because watch how fast that relationship tanks in Book Two so just pull that out. Besides that the first book was good they needed more time to develop key plot points Amons reasons Korras spiritual connect HiroshisAsamisMakosBolinsAnyones past etc.  but thats more the productions planning than anything else. Meelo sucks but you know what can you do.Book Two is not as fresh in my mind but I do have my grievances first off is the fact that Korra has reverted back to rebel teen again after being the fully realized mature avatar at the end of Book One. Second is just a Book Two version of Book One problems but worse is some cases Bolin has been reduced even more to the funny guy Desna and Eska have such little personality which I understand is the point but even Mai had personality I can barley remember which is which Unalaqs clearly bad guy persona Asami becoming the sidelined deus ex provider. Further into Book Two is the fact that the idea that people learned to bend the elements from other things Moon Dragons Sky Bison and Badgermoles aswell as before that that people bended the energy within eachother gets blown out the window with the Avatar origin story that was Beginnings This has happened a few times where LOK just says things have been a certain way for ever and yet the never actually elaborate especially if there is something conflicting in ATLA.. I also wanted to mention that even though I love Iroh I feel as though Aang should have been the one the guide Korra what else is he doing besides being dead?. Lastly I hated several aspects the end of the season. The Giant monster fight the severing of the spiritual connect when it didnt matter to Korra that much in the first place Jinora. While some aspects were neat like the idea of a dark avatar I feel it was pulled off poorly and needed better explanation. As far as Book Three goes I love it it is much better than the last two books and it still has yet to finish hopefully I dont regret that. My main complaint is the way the Beifongs have been handled. Lins sudden change after a poorly executed sequence of flashbacks Sus kids all being basic types Sporty Gothic Girl Next Door and Junior. Aswell as Su not really developing at all.Overall LOK is not as bad as some people say but it has yet to really capture what made ATLA so special to begin with.TLDR Some stuff works some doesnt who wouldve guessed?Edit I am sure there are a shit ton of grammar mistakes I just fixed a few so yeah thems the breaks.,TheLastAirbender,cjepoup,1,t5_2rybx

1587290,0,t3_2cgcpl,The show bases its premise off of a variation of theClassical Elements Of the four fire is the only one that technically doesnt originate from matter but from energy. Sure fire needs a combustable gas to be created and sustained oxygen most likely in the case of the show.

1587791,0,t1_cjf9g11,I dont know if i would go so far to call Ozai one dimensional. The continuation comics in particular flesh him out a bit its not some great insight to his character or anything hes still a massive egotistical evil prick but we get a little bit of his political philosophy and possibly some insight into why he hated Zuko right off the bat. I actually got the impression he does care for Zuko but the way he expresses it is extraordinarily destructive. Basically he wants Zuko to be as egotistical and evil as he is. Remember that scene where Zuko confronted him during the day of black sun? It seems like Ozai is legitimately disappointed that Zuko didnt take the opportunity to kill him either time he had it the first when Zuko was armed and he was without his fire bending the second when he turned his lightening back on him and to him that makes Zuko weak. In the show he seems one dimensional because we have so little time with him. He isnt a character anymore than a natural disaster is a character. Hes a conflict. Of course I dont mean to imply that hes complex or anything just that he isnt as one dimensional as he seems at first. He honestly doesnt seem that far from psychotic dictators weve had in our world.,TheLastAirbender,cjfb973,12,t5_2rybx

1589533,0,t3_2cgncb,I dont think astral projection is the special air bending skill.... it did seem like it at first but that traitor who was an earth bender in the last episode was able to meet the red lotus on the astral plane. Im not sure bout gravity.... it kinda sounds like it might be it but then again gravity is a force that seems different from the air element. Flying makes sense I guess but I would hope its something more offensive. I think its interesting how much variation the earth element has gotten... not just earth metal and lava bending... but also stuff like the sonar sense when you tap your foot on the ground like toph did... or being able to detect heartbeats and stuff like lie detection like the traitor was doing. So maybe air bending special skill will be something more subtle like that. Cant really think of any specific example. Another possibility is sound like a sonic boom. They could change air pressures and create sound waves like loud booms that can knock people away.... or maybe mimic sound waves to make people think they are hearing things.... or absence of sound make it so you cant talk. The varying pressures could also create vortexes like a whirlpool that sucks things into it. ,TheLastAirbender,cjfj5ek,1,t5_2rybx

Thats why Roku attacked Sozin the first time. The other nations saw that but didnt want a full scale war so they did nothing and hoped the Fire nation would stop. To be clear I dont mean they had a formal military. I mean they had a bunch powerful and influential Airbenders who advocated for a more active approach while the other Airbenders were not doing anything.,TheLastAirbender,cjfps66,1,t5_2rybx
1592406,0,t1_cjfuofj,gt As bending is hereditary  You keep saying that and yet you have no proof. In the real world every physical traits are hereditary because they are tied to genetics. But in the avatars world we dont know how they work. Claiming real world logic applies  to a fantasy world where magic exists is very shortsighted.We know Bending power can be given and taken dragon turtles in avatar wangs time and we know humans can only hold  power attached to their souls. Thats why Raava had to hold the other  and switch them out.  While it seems that the bending powers are hereditary because children inherit them from their parents we have absolutely no proof that they work like genes. Specifically we have no idea if children inherit  sets of bending potential.  It it entirely possible that children only inherit one potential and thus can only give out one to their own children.  Alas we will not know if it is possible or not until the show confirms it because the examples of multiple bending families we know Aangs family Bolin and Makos family etc. are too small of a sample size to conclude any kind of theory. Which would remain a theory anyway until it it proved or disproved with geneticalspiritual proof.,TheLastAirbender,cjfw639,3,t5_2rybx

The issue that I had with Unalaq was that after the Civil Wars arc there wasnt ever a moment that he showed any spark for redemption. And what bugged me about that is that to me Unalaq seemed like he had noble intentions at one point in his life and that he truly wanted peace between the humans and spirits but those goals were corrupted by his interactions with Vaatu.,TheLastAirbender,cjlu5pm,1,t5_2rybx

His main obstacle in doing that was mastering the four elements so thats what his book titles were.Korra though was designed from the offset as the antiAang. She starts the show knowing most of the elements but has little wisdom or experience in how she uses her power to keep balance in the world One of the main arguments Ive seen for TLA over Korra is that Korra lacks direction while thats not an invalid argument Id say Korra was designed that way.Thats why Balance makes sense its the end of Korras journey the same way mastering fire was for Aang.,TheLastAirbender,cjodgbq,2,t5_2rybx

Also the air nomads did know a war was coming thats why Aang was told at  not at   years early. Plain and simple the reason the air nomads lost is because firebending is  times more powerful at the peak of Sozins comet. The air nation was definitely outnumbered to begin with and on top of that the firebenders  times their usual ability. I dont think the novice airbenders just ran off. Aang says in the episode The Headband that Sozin defeated the air nomads by ambush.

1696902,0,t1_cjss5tg,gt Fair enough does the wiki say Kya is a master?Yes. see the sidebar under Chronological and political informationgtIm just hesitant to say Ming Hua is a master because the only reason she is winning her fights is because her special ability whatever it is is so damn powerful. If she was a normal water bender Kya would have waxed her easily.A lot of people have argued Jinora should be considered a master because in part of her spiritual projection ability. Not all mastery of a bending art involves mastery of all the same elements of that bending art. I think Ming Hua has enough of the basics down coupled with amazing power to make her a master for the same reason I think the bloodbending brothers were masters because even though they might not have all the waterbending forms down they have a waterbending proficiency that makes up for what they lack.I dont think Zaheer is a master because what makes him strong enough to even get his ass handed to him by Tenzin without losing immediately is his intuitive and wellhoned fighting sensetechniques which are independent of airbending. His actual mastery of airbending is less than even his asskicking by Tenzin would suggest.I dont think there is enough information about combustion lady and lava guy about their profiency with their element outside of their special abilities to judge whether they are masters but I do think there is a good chance Ghazan is one because of what we know it takes to lavabend bending small elements of earth very rapidly to heat it up which sounds to me like it requited a similar sort of mastery over earthbending to develop as metalbending Ghazan on toph level?! Probably not but maybe!Pli hasnt shown mastery over firebending because her combustion ability has been shown to develop indepently of normal firebending. All we know is that Pli can firebend and she can do so competently in clutch moments if I recall correctly which might easily be not the case Pli used firebending not her combustion attack to ward off a fire attack by Zuko. Besides that Pli is a trusted member of the Red Lotus Elite Four so she just might be a master although she does she to rely on her combustion ability in battle extensively.Ming Hua unlike the other three shows great proficiency in the core bending of her bending element and her unique trait is just bending without movement which is something weve only ever seen a master do Bumi if were not counting Amon and his father bloodbending with their minds.,TheLastAirbender,cjt237b,1,t5_2rybx

1699149,0,t1_cjtc16h,I think its fesable. Think about it there were never that many airbenders to begin with from what we saw. They wiped out the temples first which didnt have much contact with the outside world except the air nomads who would stop by every now and then. They probably laid ambushes at the temples themselves for every airbender who stopped by.

1736347,0,t3_2ec015,All avatars are fundamentally human beings they are flawed and make mistakes and they have different outlooks on life which shape the way they fulfill their roles. The world of avatar is old  years of telephone is plenty of time for the loss of knowledge and the creation of myths and legends. None of the recent avatars until Korra could look deep enough within themselves and tap the Avatars earliest shared memories. Its not surprising that Rokus knowledge is only half true he was right about other things like that the Avatar cycle will be broken if killed in the Avatar state. Killing Zuko was a philosophical difference between Roku and Aang shaped by the failure of Rokus mercy towards Sozin and Aangs inability to let go of his airbender pacifism probably due to his youth unlike Yang Chen. Yangchen pontificates in extraseries content about why the Avatar must be a human being philosophically correct but technically wrong the Avatar was never meant to be Wans story showed that the Avatar is not in fact a preordained role in the world but an even of happenstance. Remember that a lot of what we are seeing are through these limited thirdperson characters who have limits on their own knowledge.

I didnt really identify with Aang as much because of his pacifist views but I loved him as a character. I identified more with Zuko and I identify more with Korra because of her brash attitude.

They are literally completely different characters from the books now. Jaime becomes motivated by Cerseis infidelity which he finds out because Tyrion learns that he thought someone who manipulated him was one of the only people to ever actually love him. And he found that out because the one person he trusted most Jaime told Tyrion that he had been lying this whole time. That means that Tyrion allowed himself to be fooled enough to let the one person he ever loved get gangrapedliterally gangrapedright in front of him and he did nothing to stop it because he was manipulated.spoiler ,TheLastAirbender,cjy4v4y,2,t5_2rybx

I saw Book  of LoK in about a month ago and decided to just buy it.I started from Episode  as I had watched Episode  before and got really into it.

1743807,0,t1_cjylqlt,The metal that they have in the ATLA universe is a steel. The steel is most likely comprised of a combination of Iron and Coal aka carbon plus other materials. Coal is a bendable material by earthbenders Proof SE of ATLA. And judging from how Metal Bending wasnt discovered immediately it appears that pure iron is not bendable. The reason why they dont use pure iron as their metal is because it is substantially weaker and more fragile than the steel. And since there wasnt any benders at the time who could bend their steel why use the Inferior product? Not including the drill which probably had many inches of metal as their outer shell all of their metal vehicles could be destroyed relatively easily by earthbenders or other means Catapult Icebergs etc. Having pure iron would have made it easier for them to be destroyed.The problem of how Metal Bending before Toph was that Earth Benders couldnt find the coal in the metal.

The episode as a whole was brilliant.You can clearly see that Zaheer only needs a bit of ice on his leg to fall down. Big rocks are an overkill anyway. Theyre not that much harder to dodge.

1796663,0,t1_ck5icxo,I see where youre coming from and Ive certainly held that position. Well maybe if antiracistsfeministspeople talking about imperialism were more accepting and reasonable Id join the movement.The thing is though my original post thats gotten downvoted so heavily was a compliment to the show. A backhanded one to be sure but I recognized many of the ways the show is ahead of its time. Its not like I came in here screeching about how Avatar is the most racist shit in the world. I just failed to praise it enough. Any mention of its possible failings as a political force pisses people off.And thats why Im not real convinced that being gentle and kind and willing to give cultural appropriation a pass if it comes packaged with cool inversions of gender roles will help win hearts because any mention of this sort of stuff is going to leave people feeling uncomfortable and defensive. Remember my initial post said the cultural appropriation was arguable and folks are still acting like Im denouncing the show with fire and brimstone.Look the basis for the cultural appropriation argument is that Mike and Bryan are benefiting from telling an already familiar story of Asian cultures they dont belong to so that they can make money. That last bits the kicker and why Im more concerned with this than say people using anime avatars on web forums. I think Ive discussed this reasonably and with nuance and giving a lot of credit to the creators where the credit is due but the mere topic of discussion here leaves people so defensive that Im pissing folks off regardless of my tone or my attention to complexities.Because yeah a lot of research went into Avatar and they do their damnedest to make it a respectful show but having another kung fu Asian narrative focused on wisdom and balance in a context where thats such a dominant story that it doesnt leave room for much else is kinda  shitty especially when its a story not being made by people from the culture it depicts. ,TheLastAirbender,ck5m94y,1,t5_2rybx

1851753,0,t3_2fs92b,I think Aang died around s correct me if Im wrong. Katara would be  when korra was born almost  right now.  I dont know Korras age.Katara has a  or so grand child. I dont know Ikkis and Melos ages.Trying not to think of teenage pregnacy.. She still has  years to go for her first greatgrandchildren.So Katara will die around  if her grandchildren decide to reproduce fast. By that time Korra would be around late s Early s.

1938729,0,t3_2gukbg,Bloodbending is incredibly powerful but it DOES have its limitations.  Prolonged use full puppetry without the full moon would be a significant drain on energy.  A typical bloodbender Hama Katara also requires line of sight to use it unlike Toph and her seismic sense.  Also they can be overwhelmed by sheer number of combatants.  Theres no reason to believe that Yakone could control hundreds of enemy soldiers before they could get close enough to hurt him.  A courthouse full of civilians metalbenders the Avatar and a few other benders is incredibly impressive but Yakone still had to run.  He couldnt take over the city all at once.     Of course Lets not foget that Amon nor Yakone did not require line of sight to use their psychic bloodbending technique.   That is a stupidly massive advantage.  A single combatant cannot in almost any and all circumstances can sneak up on them unlike Aang with Toph in The Blind Bandit.  Tenzin can float around all he wants.  Amon can still see him.They can alsoPredict and sense enemy bending attacks before they happenThrow Off an enemy benders technique causing them to miss or falter in their attacks.  Its incredibly subtle and probably feels like a muscle cramp or a tiny mistake to the enemy bender.         Dissipating Korras Water Spout in The Winner Is...           Dodging Lightening Bolt Zolts lightening in The Revelation     Yakone cancelling out Tophs metalbending cables     Amon resisting and overpowering Tarrlocks bloodbending  Note that this only works if the bloodbender has a wide understanding of the bending styles and attacks which is why Amon is completely unable to dodge or divert airbending.  Tenzin blasts him off the stage with a direct hit not even a sneak attack.  Korra then kicks him out of a window due to his fatigue from being struck by Makos lightening.Combustion benders would serve as a serious threat and honestly might have the necessary range to snipe a bloodbender before they can sense the incoming attack.  If a bloodbender were able to get a combustion bender in their grip its feasible that two things can happen.  The bloodbender explodes or the combustion bender has hisher neck snappedblood vessels poppedbrain crushed suffers damage to their third eye.As for Bumi since he can just use his face I doubt that Amon or Yakone could accurately predict that.  Regardless Bumi would have to down them with one well placed attack or hed be disabled.  He could still earthbend while under a bloodbending grip but itd take a little luck to down Amon or Yakone once that happened.  TLDR Bloodbending is ridiculously powerful but it is not perfect or without its vulnerabilities.     ,TheLastAirbender,ckmt6pb,7,t5_2rybx

1978210,0,t1_ckrk7hd,Im just gonna copypaste something I wrote a couple days ago. Im so fuck sick of seeing this.Why would they? Im so fucking sick of people saying the show was pulled off TV because it was violentdark. The writers have gone on record with saying that the sole reason the show was pulled off TV was because of poor ratings and nothing else. Its not because Korra is totally actually the darkest and most mature TV show ever in the history of the planet and Nickelodeon is immature and wouldnt let them get away with showing a few deaths. The season was written it was approved for production the show was produced it was approved for airing it aired and got bad ratings and so was put on the internet where it did fairly well. Thats it. No secret censoring no last minute plug pulls because of mature content...shitty ratings. Nothing else. Sure Nickelodeon can be blamed for poor advertising but not lets not talk down about a network for stuff it didnt do. The writers said that they liked working with Nickelodeon because of the freedom they allowed. Very little executive meddling in the show and a lot of trust in the team to tell the story they want to tell. Nickelodeon should be praised for this not be turned into some evil villain because of bad marketing on their part. Then again who could really blame them for putting Korra in the backseat after people steadily stopped watching season  as it aired and the season was widely considered to be pretty bad. No one is evil here. The production team made a subpar season that lost viewers and Nickelodeon recognized this and instead of cancelling the show they at least saw it through to the end.,TheLastAirbender,ckrkovw,1,t5_2rybx

This will take place for about a year. Mako Bolin and the rest of the main cast go their separate ways. Excluding Korras imediate family.As Tenzin said the Air Nomads have made a task force for doing Korras job. In an effort to regain control the Earth Kingdom atfter the chaos in the city Suyin appoints Kuvira to lead the armypolice of the Earth Kindom or Ba Sing Se. Bolin joims this force and is a high ranking officer. Kuvira gets out of control and has ideals too extreme but the right thought yadayadayada airbenders pissed at what theyre doing and war emerges in finale.Meanwhile Korra gets pissed she cant do jack shit so once shes healed or at least able to walk she leaves and tries to get back someplace after hear information about something crucial to the plot. She crash lands somewhere and a few episodes in the swamp forrest area. Thats all i got for now.,TheLastAirbender,cktc0rv,28,t5_2rybx

When you were in high school there were DOZENS of  year olds you would have gladly boinked back then. You dont feel like doing so now not because theyre less physically attractive or because youre supposed to be biologically repulsed by the thought but because their personalities are immature and no longer interest you. Physically nothing has changed since before the middleages. A female is still a woman from the moment she gets her first period. The only thing thats changed is the fact that people in firstworld countries no longer need to procreate with teenagers to sustain their bloodline before they die and because of this its slowly become more and more taboo to have relations with a woman who hasnt reached emotional and social maturity.So placing yourself in the shoes of a character in the Avatar world full of war and death Yes Katara is okay.,TheLastAirbender,ckuwwm5,-2,t5_2rybx

2060481,0,t1_cl1q7i5,This is the fight where they fall down Zuko needs saving by his friends but Azula totally pulls herself out of the bind on her own? Yeah no thats not a stalemate. When you run away from the person who attacked you thats not a stalemate. In fact when they showed how Zuko needed his friends but Azula needed no one it showed that Azula was still ahead of him. Zukos inner peace and newfound perspective on firebending closed the gap him fighting Azula was no longer one big embarrassment after another but Azula was still simply in a class of her own.I actually like that Zuko was an above average firebender but not a firebending genius like most of his family members. It humanized him to show how he overcame this shortcoming by being an honourable ruler good friend and skilled nonbending combatant. I mean Iroh and Ozai were incredible firebenders and Azula had mastered lightning at . Thats some stiff competition in the Fire Nation Royal Family. Id love it if Honora the current Firelord in LoK was a nonbender. One of the reasons Zukos father grandfather and sister thought Azula was more fit to rule was because she was a better firebender.

2089240,0,t3_2iscpv,Aah I was just talking about this today! To answer the question its entirely possible! With the segregation of nations its entirely possible it was only until the nations met again that two bending parents produced a child with both bending genes. A friend pointed out there surely would have been cases of rapeinduced children from the war but it would have most likely involved Fire Nation benders and nonbending Earth Nation women.In addition to a wonderful video on the genetics of avatar theres a few different models of thought I came up with to try and explain bending in a purely scientific manner!One model is to think of air water earth and fire bending as simply controlling gases liquids solid and energy. This would explain Bolins ability to lava bend if you consider it a combination of earth and energy bending which would be possible due to his mom and dads split heritage.It gets a little tricky considering waterbenders being able to freeze liquids but water bending does involve movement and manipulation of energy through healing and its lore. Im unsure of this point but unless the benders in the season  finale were earthbenders then bending nonwater liquids is also possible.Another point of contention is also metalbenders not being able to bend pure metals like platinum but by going deeper and identifying chemical bonds or considering only carbonbending you can get past this pretty quickly.,TheLastAirbender,cl5dzwj,2,t5_2rybx

2097906,0,t3_2iv6s3,Your idea makes sense and it would also explain why the avatar cycle would end if the avatar was killed in the avatar state. The avatar state is when Raava and the Avatar are truly connected and killing the avatar in the avatar state would also kill Raava and she would need to be reborn into Vaatu. Conversely if the Avatar dies outside of the Avatar state Raava herself isnt dying. Shes just going along for the ride so to speak.Interesting thought. I like it.,TheLastAirbender,cl6hnnk,2,t5_2rybx

2111852,0,t1_cl881s8,I never realized that! Thanks for sharing. It is actually exactly the reason why I became absorbed by ATLA. I have a huge disdain for goodevil dichotomies. It is so unrealistic compared to real life where no one can really be classified as good or evil until they die. It is also why I found the His Dark Materials universe like the ATLA universe more intriguing than the Harry Potter universe for example. This quote from Amber Spyglass sums it up and I think ATLA totally applies the same viewpointI stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us. And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do not for what they are. All we can say is that this is a good deed because it helps someone or thats an evil one because it hurts them. People are too complicated to have simple labels.,TheLastAirbender,cl89f36,60,t5_2rybx

2118954,0,t3_2j7lxf,Season  and  were pretty terrible both character wise and plot wise the writing was amateur at best. I can totally understand why fans of the original series would stop watching the show season  especially really wasnt that great. Super Jinora and the kaiju fight were both reflections of just how bad the shows writing had become.I know a couple of friends who had never seen ATLA and still gave up halfway through season  because the writing was so glaringly terrible.Season  was a massive step in the right direction the world still doesnt feel like it did in ATLA but the writing has improved immensely the characters are likeable the consistency in the lore has been good and the story feels like an epic adventure again.Its still too early to tell how Season  will pan out but so far its been interesting enough.EDIT I know this isnt a popular opinion and I honestly couldnt care less the Korra circlejerk on this subreddit is insane. This is my opinion its one shared by many fans of the series but its one obviously not shared on this subreddit. Ive said this since the first episode of the first season of Korra my comment history on this subreddit backs this up. Obviously the marketing and sales staff alongside the higher ups in Nickelodeon also agree the reason the show has performed poorly is due to the terrible start is had. Avatar The Last Airbender was one of the most popular animes in the West anime just isnt mainstream but ATLA most certainly was. It was a well loved IP the poor writing worked against that. Now its been dropped and more than likely we will never see another Avatar show again.EDIT  Im not alone thats a nice feeling. Ive voiced similar opinions before in different threads but Ive never had so many people come out in agreement. Season  was dope season  and  were beyond shit.,TheLastAirbender,cl95y7i,7,t5_2rybx

We dont know the details of it of course but considering the Water Tribes homes apparently being side theaters for most of it and the Air Nomads being wiped out in the initial attack the brunt of the fighting would have to have taken place in the Earth Kingdom. Even with all their superior technology and militarized society it took the Fire Nation a hundred years to conquer it. The Earth Empire has a powerful army stateofthearttechnology and the loyalty of the populace.

2153366,0,t3_2jmu7w,I dont think Toph is judging Korras motivations at the end of the episode in the way you think she is.  Toph isnt really going against her earlier assertion that the names change but the street says the same by confronting Korras subconscious desire for an excuse to get her out of doing what she dreads shes just forcing Korra to examine her innermost thoughts and feelings.  Shes doing what Korra asked her to do make her better in her own unique and completely blunt way.Also I think theres a lot of room for interpretation in Tophs original sentiment about the world not needing Korra.  Korra like many viewers took what she said to mean that the struggle against imbalance and darkness is ultimately irrelevant but I dont think that was actually the point.  She said I worked my butt off as chief of police but that didnt make crime disappear.  What she wants Korra to understand is that the battle will never be over because it cant be won only fought.  That doesnt make the struggle not worthwhile but it should change how one views it and approaches it.  The roles of avatar and chief of police are after all similar in many ways as chief of police it was in a very real sense Tophs duty to bring balance to a miniature world constantly threatening to dissolve into chaos. So Toph used the comparison between their roles to attempt to make Korra understand the error of her own view of herself and her purpose.  She wants to deflate Korras unrealistic sense of selfimportance and come to terms with the reality that even though shes the Avatar shes just a person.  There was a long line of Avatars before her and there will be a long line after and every one of them will be fighting the same fight and none of them will ever win.  Even nonavatars have been struggling with the same battle since the dawn of time and they continue to do so even as Korra and Toph sit in the swamp.  Lin is now chief of police and someday someone else will succeed her.  Crime will continue but those that oppose it will also continue.I think Toph is trying to make Korra understand that her role as the avatar doesnt necessarily mean that she HAS to be the most powerful being alive and stand in front of everyone to shield the entire world from any and all dangers and that if she doesnt manage to do this it doesnt make her a failure.  Because ultimately SHES JUST NOT THAT IMPORTANT.  People manage to get along for the most part without crazy Avatar powers to fall back on and many problems work themselves out.  Korra doesnt need to and shouldnt try to carry the entire world on her shoulders because thats not her damn job.And perhaps in a broader sense especially given the chosen title for this final book Toph is attempting to help Korra to finally realize that as the Avatar her duty is to maintain balance in the world.  It isnt about good triumphing over evil its about holding back the encroaching darkness and preventing it from overshadowing the light.  After all without one how would you recognize the other?  Balance has been a consistent theme in both Avatar series and maybe were finally going to explore just what that means.Man... Ive reeeeeally missed Toph.    They sure chose the absolutely perfect time to reintroduce her.  The wait was totally worth it.,TheLastAirbender,cldjibj,5,t5_2rybx

2159915,0,t1_clbzzvm,Absolutely agree. Prob the thing that struck me as the most interesting thing while watching this third episode.... and something that I have seen much more apparent in this second series is how you can almost sympathize with some of the villians.... some of their motives are almost relatable when you consider their past. If you take Red Lotus and Kuvira.... the Queen and whole monarchy system DOES seem outdated.... both the Queen and future king were pretty stupid and outrageous hell I even remember the old king with his pet bear being kinda silly too..... they just seemed really egotistical and not suited to rule a whole nation. The future King was more worried about clothes then what was goin on in the rest of the world.Kuvira almost seems like a much better fit considering how she did infact bring all these villages together and fend off attackers. She rose up and did something when others were happy to just take care of their own. She is totally right that the idea of the monarchy and appointed rulers needs to end and people who show skill and leadership should be in charge. Its only the fact that she has these hints of being overly aggressive and wanting to be dictator powerful... and possibly using excessive force to get what she wanted from people who went against her or didnt want to follow her I have a feeling she was behind those looters who stole the food from the bison in the second episode. So her intentions and motives seem to be for a good cause but her personal character flaws get in the way of it and make her seem to extreme like some of the previous villians. Even if she is not the best fit for the new Queen of Earth Nation... I still think anyone else would be better then the King we have seen or anyone in his lineage. I love the character development in this show.... especially the villians. When you almost root for them thats when you know you watching some good stuff. ,TheLastAirbender,cledi0u,2,t5_2rybx

2197732,0,t1_clj6a8k,My personal list Apologies in advance. I disliked how the relationship between Mako and Korra was the driving force of the first several episodes. Relationships are great except when theyre the major focal point instead of a background thing like Aang was with Katara. It was a backdrop an extra treat to the events of the episode. Not the events of the episode itself. . It backpedals so freaking much on character development it hurts. The whole first season was about Korra maturing as an individual and losing a huge amount of her hotheadedness and learning to trust others and be reasonable.  Which she then summarily threw out the window several times over in the nd season. It make the st season literally irrelevant because Korra is just static.   . As a redeeming note I rather liked the idea of the Northern Water Tribe invading the South and Korra having to pick sides. Not picking issues with that nor Wan. Wan is awesome.  . Back on topic Season  was supposed to be about spirits. But less than  of the episodes and the events within actually dealt with the spirits. Book  felt like it was trying to decide if the invasion was the major plot or were the dark spirits the major plot. It managed to not really devote enough time and detail to either so both felt really childlike and not quality writing.  . The Villain. This and my next grievance are the real nails in the coffin. All the other stuff could have been ignored if it wasnt for this. Unalaq is by far the worst villain the show has ever had. Not only was he woefully onedimensional but they tried and failed to make him multifaceted by completely lacking any motivation for his actions. We literally have no idea why Unalaq went from trying to help or even if he was trying to help as a facade Korra deal with the dark spirits to becoming the Dark Avatar. Hes just randomly evil and nobody knows why. Even Ozai had more motivation and backstory than that and Ozai was designed to be fairly onedimensional.  . Dat Ending. The Deus Ex Machina way the writers handled this really upset me. Unalaq after becoming the Dark Avatar becomes a giant spirit monster thing goes to destroy the world. Still no idea why but whatever. And then Korra tries to stop him and fails. And then she is able to beat him because out of freaking nowhere Jinora shows up to become a Jesuslike figure. With zero backstory forewarning or any kind of leading up to it. This conflict was suddenly over with zero lasting consequences because something randomly conveniently came in to save the day.With Aang we constantly see throughout the series that he refuses to kill and leading up to Avatar Aang we see that he is still really struggling with trying to find a solution to this without violating his principles and we even see the Lion Turtle which gave him energybending. So in TLA we clearly see how the problem is established and we are given a huge hint as to how its going to be solved before the conflict happens With Korra we got none of that. Jinora just pops up and there we go. tldr Blue Giant Spirit monsters are dumb. Season  and to a much lesser extent Korra as a whole feels like a huge letdown compared to the quality of The Last Airbender. Though I totally understand that Korra was supposed to be a miniseries so no hard feelings to the writers. ,TheLastAirbender,clj6piy,11,t5_2rybx

Even once in the state she didnt really land anything on him even before the poison kicked in he was a brand new airbender who just unlocked an ability hed never trained with and was keeping up with her in the avatar state it kinda breaks the previous practiced mastery idea of their universe where Korra is just ineffective for plot purposes.

2243626,0,t1_clp0llc,Ive read elsewhere that the vines Varrick is using are from the fight with UnaVaatu so it is only logical that the vines contain part of Vaatus energy.  The whole objective of Varricks experiments were to encapsulate this energy however Kuvira plans to release this energy as a form of attack.Jinora has already shown that the acceleration of Raava is possible and so it is not out of the question that Vaatu may feed on the release energy of the spirit vines to grow stronger.

Once she met TophYoda who basically spelled out what she had to do to get passed everything mentally she got the poison out which could only be done by moving on.

Flight requires that you have no earthly attachments but astral projection seems to require very strong connections with other people as well as with the spirits.Bloodbending vs Healing  Bloodbending is sinister and causes harm to a person from the inside while healing is benign and heals a person.Lightning vs Combustion  Not really sure about this. Perhaps lighting is all about the flow of energy while combustion seems to compact it into small spaces and release it all at once. Kind of a stretch but yeah.,TheLastAirbender,clqmwgm,12,t5_2rybx

Shell run out of steam long before Kuvira.Im not so sure about that.  Toph will do her best to conserve her energy and weve seen her avoid attacks without much movement.  As someone else stated shes good at manipulating her environment to avoid attacks. I havent seen Kuvira show any indication by either skill or strength that she is more than a talented metal bender.gt And even if she doesnt Kuvira doesnt fight nearly as fair.Somehow I have never really seen Toph as a fair fighter.  Esp now that shes old.gt Shes not above using modern weapons or her armies in combination with her own ability.I think Toph would wreak havoc if Kuvira tried to bring in an army to back her up.  There would be a new mountain range where an army once stood.  I havent seen Kuvira do things like make an big earth body exoskeleton like Toph has.  Toph could just do her  league boot walking with her earth bending and take an army of mechs out just doing that.gt Toph has lost fights before. Thats what makes fighters good fighters.  You learn nothing if you win all the time.gt She could have been beaten by the Sand Benders if they had used her holding up the Library against herThe fact that she was holding up the Library under adverse conditions and at a young age only shows how tough she is.  Kuvira is good at throwing metal at earth benders but we havent really seen her do anything outside the ability of other metal benders.  Toph is an old master now but Kuvira still hasnt done anything with her ability that would imply that Toph would have a problem dealing with her.gt Kuvira would not be above misdirecting Toph by attacking someone she cares aboutSure.  Toph wouldnt be above forcing mud down her throat and expanding outward.gt A well placed electric net a field altered to be made of shifting sand or a cheapshot from a new weapon would be enough to take Toph by surprise. Anybody can get sucker punched.  Its what happens after you sucker punch someone that counts.,TheLastAirbender,cltz40s,4,t5_2rybx
2286109,0,t3_2lf83z,i would say noif Korra hooked up with Meelo when hes of age it is not incest because there is no familial relation between Korra and Meelo. Hell Korra could procreate with Tenzin and it wouldnt be incestuous.If Meelo and Korra had a daughter and Korra promptly died and the next Earthbending Avatar fell in love with Meekos daughter and they had sex it wouldnt be incest because the new Avatar is from a different familial line.Itd only be incest if they were cousins through a series of marriages.The only thing that really connects Avatars is Raavas spirit. Even then the Avatars body is just the vessel for Raava until that avatar dies. I imagine it like a progression of alumni with the previous avatar graduating the year before the next avatar. The avatar could be anyone granted there are a few rules but the only thing they share is the credentials of graduating from the same role.,TheLastAirbender,clua32y,8,t5_2rybx

You may be right that lava would turn water to steam too fast but thats an assumption and based on the instant freezing water benders can do and theoretically repeatedly do each time the lava melts it its instantly frozen again I would have to say water bending and lava bending are pretty evenly split.  Lava bending I think is overrated.  Its super powerful but it has severe limitations.  It doesnt have the mobility air fire or water give to a bender.

It wouldnt distract from the plot no more than Aang and Katara bogged down the plot. People like seeing multiple and complex goals for their character. A relationship is another goal. Hell look at The Empire strikes back. Han and Leia fall for each other but it doesnt distract the viewer from the Empire taking a massive shit on the Rebels. Characters in a narrative are people. People tend to have interactions and affections for other people. So romantic interests just add another sense of believably to a character. ,TheLastAirbender,cm8sabn,8,t5_2rybx

2465270,0,t1_cmg9t87,The most complex relationship in the Avatar universe was between the Avatar and the FireLord. And Im talking about Aang and Zuko. They grew up in a situation where it is only natural they are enemies. In the most basic sense it was Zukos family who eradicated Aangs familypeoplenation. Zuko hired a combustion bender to track down and eliminate Aang. Zuko had captured Aang many times and as a result had a chance first hand to eliminate Aang himself. Nonetheless the worst Zuko ever did was temporarily blinding Toph and intent to kill Aang but never succeeding.Zaheer an evil airbender was very different from Amon and Unalaq. Amon stripped Korra of her bending. It could be inferred through the flashback with Aang and Yakone only the Avatar State could combat fully realized bloodbending. Although Korra didnt have the Avatar State she did reach rock bottom and deus ex machinadairbend kicked Amon out a window where he retreated and you know murdersuicide escapade. And then luckily Aang deus ex machinadenergy bended Korras bending back. Unalaq was her unclefathers brother who merged with The Kite of EvilSpirit of Chaos and Darknesscounterpart to Raava. The fight with UnaVaatu was of apocalyptic proportions which led to the severing of Korras connection to get past Avatar lives.luckily Aangs spiritual wunderkind granddaughter deus ex machinad and helped Korra find Raava thus leading to the defeat of Unalaq and Vaatu killing Unalaq as a result. Bryke had these two antagonists perform actions that would leave Korra with traumatic repercussions without much time to recover and face what they did to her. Then comes Zaheer. If you delve into anythinganyone if you try hard enough you can find an infinite amount of depth. Therefore since most of us know the stories of Zaheer  evil airbender  will do. Zaheer was able to place Korra in a vulnerable position much like Amon and UnalaqVaatu did. Due to great writing in Venom of the Red Lotus Korra had delirious visions of her previous antagonists.Fun fact Venom of the Red Lotus shows Amon Unalaq Vaatu and Amon in a serious settingThanks to Bryke we get to see the  of them together in a comical settingUnlike his predecessors Zaheer is alive and imprisoned. And its only fitting that his imprisonment is he is chained to the ground  earthly tether. Korra went through the first phase of her PTSD recovery for three years. But still to no avail did Korra feel whole. Luckily for her unlike Amon and Unalaq she can actually face Zaheer. And once again because of amazing writing we have Zaheer be the one who guides Korra to become whole once again. If there is one person Bryke has written that knows how to put the past in the past its Zaheer. Sadly for us it means he will probably be imprisoned for the remainder of his life. Luckily for him it seems he doesnt mind just living in the Spirit World. The Spirit World cant be that bad if thats where Iroh wants to spend the rest of eternity.TLDR Zuko had all the intent to hurt the Avatar but ultimately failed which made him become as LoK said the one who knows Aang the best. Zaheer had all the intent in the world to hurt Korra and he succeeded. And since hes alive he got to be the person Korra needed to face to lead to recovery from all the traumatic transgressions against her.Zaheer  calmcollective as fuck BOOM all in your face RAWR do you want me to be your spirit guide and go on a quick life changing experience REAL QUICK,TheLastAirbender,cmgeov6,13,t5_2rybx

2541996,0,t3_2ossr3,gtYes Kuvira already has harnessed some spirit energy but now that the spirits are abandoning the physical world there is no more for her to harness.This isnt the case.  Kuvira is harvesting spirit vines which are certainly not abandoning the physical world.  As of right now she doesnt know how to use other spirits as weapons and theres no reason for her to find out unless the Spirit Vine supply goes away which wont happen any time soon considering how much of it there is and how she wont have much of a reason to use the cannon after Republic City falls.The spirits may be timeless but they fail to realize that this isnt just another Human war its now their war too.  Theyre taking full advantage of the benefits of Korra opening the portals but failing to recognize that such benefits also come with responsibilities.  If Humans and Spirits are going to live together they also have to work together.  So far the spirits have taken over half of Republic City without permission only to abandon it the moment someone threatens their home.The eel spirit says that Korra trying to convince the spirits to help with defense is exactly the same thing that Kuvira or Unalaq wanted to pervert the spirits power for their own gain.  But this isnt the truth at all Korra hopes that they will aid her in defending the livelihood that they have built together the place that both spirits and humans have been living in.  This isnt about using the spirits but rather cooperating with them.,TheLastAirbender,cmqdjj1,3,t5_2rybx

Im pretty sure that varrik and asami will be trying to take out the spirit gun Mako and Bolin will be fighting Bataar Jr whos in a mecha tank while Korra is fighting NegaKorra and Kuvira all at once. The first episode will have the friends setting up the attack and taking out the gun and fighting the army while Korra is getting her butt kicked by Nega Korra and Kuvira. Episode two Korra will have a realizationdefeataccept nega Korra and finally go into the avatar state and chase Kuvira around finally disabling her at the end.Oh and the gaang kidsfamily will mostly be fighting the army or helping evacuate people. Some things I think will happen  Aang Statue is destroyed along with  of republic city.  Korra doesnt kill Kuvira or Kuvira realizes her error.  Bataar Jr dies.

2561309,0,t1_cmsvv1u,Im trying to think how to word this so forgive me if it doesnt make much sense. I feel like the build up to a character dying is far less important than the aftermath of it I dont really think that you need to have hints saying This character has fulfilled their purpose get ready. The character deaths that have hit me the hardest have always been like that the heroes go up against a massive force far more powerful they are capable of killing them in an instant and one of them is too slow and afterwards everything changes.As opposed to stories where there was lots of build up a heroic sacrifice by a beloved character but then nobody changes because of it and I just...get annoyed. Character death isnt about the changes before the character dies but about the effects it has on the story later. Lord of the Rings for example I dont think there was much build up to Gandalf getting dragged down by the Balrog other than this thing is so scary which we have here but his death hit me harder than Borimirs.Mako is central losing him would force character development on every character I care about except kuvira but she already got hers firing the weapon I really dont think that theyre going to off Mako and they might actually not have enough time to make the most of it if they do but Id be surprised and I love it when stories surprise me. I agree that Suyin and the twins make more sense but Mako makes more impact can you imagine Bolin without Mako? Korra losing one of her friends? The possibilities are almost endless plus if Im being honest Mako doesnt do much for me hes just sort of...there.,TheLastAirbender,cmswf80,9,t5_2rybx

She doesnt laugh or show pride when she gives the order that would have him blown up which to me shows that she cares about him but found her mission more important. I think that Bryke tried to get across that their relationship as loving though probably not equal but didnt have time to flesh out their emotional relationship due to timebudget constraints.

2592540,0,t3_2pi9wo,While i like the idea i feel there are limits. The creators have specifically said water bending is the strongest form which is evident in everything that they can do on the show. I just wanted to hit on some of your pointsIn theory water benders can only bend HO which is a chemical compound. H at low temperatures forms ice or low pressure?. The hole in your statement is that they can condense it to be as dense as earthmetal. Ice is actually less dense than water thus could never be as dense as metal. Them throwing normal ice blocks around is totally feasible though.As a side note here as stated from Iroh all bending forms can take tips from the other forms and incorporate them into their own... aka lighting redirection from waterbending. Waterbenders could probably use some form from earthbending to throw large ice blocks. One could feel ripples in water to possible detect lies. Actually i suppose one could feel an increase in blood pressure or increase in blood flow thus telling if someone is lying. Totally possible. I feel just as they ripped the water from the plants they would rip the water from the air not control the air. Just as katara basically does in the desert. I feel they cant rip it from humans is due to a graphic nature. They can putpull metal intoout of their bodies no reason water shouldnt work the same. This is especially true since water can pass through the skin and most parts of your body basically everything besides your bladder and stomach. To create lighting requires quickly freezing and heating of water to release energy so since a water bender can create ice and thus i assume they could heat it they could create some form of electricity or small lightning. Firebenders can do it because they essentially bend energy.All of this would be increasingly possible in a full moon or some super genetically gifted waterbender in a dire circumstance.,TheLastAirbender,cmwzdaj,5,t5_2rybx

2612619,0,t3_2prjz9,Heres the factsNickelodeon did NOTHING WHATSOEVER to suggest any enduring romantic relationship between Korra and Mako. None whatsoever.Nickelodeon DID suggest a romantic relationship with Asami. While there was nothing overt there were a number of moments that taken with the context of the final scene if not on their own DO suggest that if not strongly.Finally Nickelodeon DID NOT draw any specific resolution to that question.So what you have is an IMPLICATION that theres something romantic between Asami and Korra If not direct evidence you have NO IMPLICATION that there is anything between her and Mako or anyone else and you have NO EXPLICIT RESOLUTION of the question.Therefore youre free to make whatever ending you want from it and the one ending that we have some specific reason to believe is that Korra and Asami are romantically involved.But its important to mention that even though we have indicators we have no proof or really any real evidence. Some people find the idea of an ElsaAnna Frozenesque love to be more fulfulling in this sort of context than romantic love and I think thats fine.Let the LGBT and Rule communities get what they want from the ending. For my part as a straight white dude I think theyre into each other.,TheLastAirbender,cmzlu5z,1,t5_2rybx

2613035,0,t1_cmzndfw,Theres been a looooooooot of buildup dear you just missed it. It goes back to season  at the very latest. Season  should probably be discounted because they didnt know if they were getting more seasons then and there wasnt a lot in season . But they were paired up a lot in season  with a lot of wonderful interaction. Huge bonds of trust through the entire show always looking out for each other. Asami taking care of Korra while wheelchair bound offering to go to the South Pole telling her how much she misses her when shes gone. Korra only writing to Asami because shes the only person Korra trusts with her feelings. The Reunion flirting and blush. And Asami going to Air Temple Island with Korra while her mansion is full of people and offering her so much support. Theres a lot more. But seriously theyve been building it up for at least two seasons.But either way all the other ships had no buildup so I dont get this complaint. Even if I admitted there was no buildup between the girls which I wouldnt did we forget that Masami had about  seconds of buildup before they were officially dating?

2614110,0,t3_2pt4g0,Honestly a gay couple in a kids show is pretty much unprecedented so its hard to compare them to all these straight couples. There is natural romantic tension between boy and girl fictional characters. That is a big part of story telling that we are used to and it is expected. Build up for a gay couple has to be very ambiguous as exposing kids to homosexuality is still controversial unfortunatelyI think working around the logistics of being appropriate for nick they came up with a wonderful way to explore some romance between these two characters. They have become very close and want to spend time alone together. They left holding hands not kissing because they are just now having strong feelings for each other and are beginning to explore those feelings. We have to trust that the build up we saw with other couples is yet to come for them and that all that will happen after the show. ,TheLastAirbender,cmzsvv2,8,t5_2rybx

Asami had no other family members in the season in fact for the whole series from the second her father betrayed her.

Sometimes stories evolve as youre writing them. When they said they had no plans for another relationship they were almost certainly telling the truth at the time. That doesnt mean that they couldnt have changed their minds later on as the story developed.You cant expect the plans for a story that were created in book two to remain exactly the same over the entire course of three full books. Plans change characters evolve sometimes in directions you didnt expect them to. It happens anybody who writes knows that it happens. Its not at all uncommon.Just because your plans change later doesnt mean you were lying about what they were at the beginning.,TheLastAirbender,cn036r1,4,t5_2rybx

2617474,0,t1_cn06nj0,I should say that Im neither pro nor antiKorrasami but I totally agree with you. When I first heard about Korrasami my initial reaction was that everyone was reading too much into their behaviour. But as the series progressed I began to see the signs. They were subtle but they were there. From my own experience same sex relationships do often start when two friends realise that theyre something more. However sometimes women can just be really really really good friends. Anyway I feel like if the final scene ended with a kiss it wouldnt have seemed natural. Although it seems like something was blossoming between them it would have been too soon in my opinion. There was no real build up and it would have seemed completely out of left field. I feel like the ending as it was it left things open ended reflecting the myriad directions that their relationship could take.,TheLastAirbender,cn08qfa,17,t5_2rybx

2617671,0,t1_cn08kih,IF you accept accept it as canonIt is hard to edit a video correctly so it feels right and in many cases it is easier to make it flow by have the footage speak for itself. If they had a extra minute to spare in the episode they wouldve probably have had something a more substantial and personal conversation.  For the feeling of them not hitting it off you are right in saying that there are very few scenes to support it in Season  and less in S one more reason to want more episodes full of character interaction and may have needed more hints throughout rather than the occasional big shows in order to not surprise people not expecting it.

And one hinting at more to come if not in the literal sense. ATLA was all about grand adventure a group of friends travel through a world of possibilities to fight the final boss and get a happily ever after.

2622059,0,t1_cn0t8pf,The AVClub review phrases it best I thinkgtThe nature of Korra and Asamis relationship isnt made overly explicit but the writers heavily hint at a romantic connection by having the two characters holding hands and looking into each others eyes as they teleport to the spirit world for a muchneeded vacation. Its not uncommon for platonic friends to hold hands especially when theyre getting ready to do something scary together but its that final look that elevates their relationship to something more. The handholding is more than enough to make Korrasami shippers go nuts but the reaction probably wouldnt be as strong if the episode ended with Korra and Asami facing forward rather than toward each other.,TheLastAirbender,cn0ua2n,-1,t5_2rybx

2622833,0,t1_cn0um8s,Pretty much every time Korra split from the group in book  aside from the finale was when she and Asami went off to do some bonding and emotional outpouring and deep talks and teamwork stuff.Remember that in book  she was the one alone with Korra in pretty much every episode  driving around republic city having their talks going to the town to collect the tax money the escape from the airship sailing through the desert getting Korra to express her frustrations after chasing Iwai escaping the springs town on naga trying to reassure Korra outside the city hall after harmonic convergence taking personal care of Korra in the wheelchair etc.Following that she was the only one who Korra wrote was bringing her tea etc offering to go to the southern pole with her doing the whole blushing complimenting of hair and outfits etc and finally after their city was destroyed confided in each other over the loss of Asamis dad and Korras regret about being away from Asami for so long with Asami saying she couldnt have handled losing Korra.By the end they had more interpersonal time than any other main character who got into a relationship the closest would be Katara and Aang around book  amp early book  where they talked about Aangs fear of the avatar state and letting the world down.,TheLastAirbender,cn0xwtn,2,t5_2rybx

2623674,0,t3_2px7hr,Im conflicted about this. On the one hand the finale did imply a deeper connection than friendship with the handholding and the Aang and Katara theme. However it purposely only implied it despite what the creators were clearly trying to convey. Which brings me to my next question was a romance set up well at all? I have heard three pieces evidence about the romance the letters the blushing and the wheelchair pulling. First of all does anyone really believe that Sokka wouldnt pull Aangs wheelchair for one ceremony? Second of all while blushing usually does indicate romantic attraction it only happened once. I saw someone post a picture earlier of Zuko blushing at Toph gripping his arm and they clearly had nothing going on. Finally who else was Korra going to send the letters too? Mako was acting extremely awkwardly since they broke up Bolin wouldnt understand and Tenzin is not her age. They certainly became closer because of that but it was never shown. That said many people believe that this doubt only occurs because viewers are not used to a homosexual relationship. To a degree that maybe so but the fact of the matter is no relationship in Avatar has ever been built up in this way. Aang and Katara had entire episodes dedicated to them Mai betrayed Azula for love Sokka was waiting for Sukki in his tent and Toph screamed for Sokka while drowning.  This is evident in Korra too From the first moment Bolin sees them he is explicitly interested in Korra Eska and Ginger. Zhu li and Varrick got episodes of angst. Mako  Asami and Korra got episodes of explicit love triangles. Why did Korra act so differently around Mako when she was in love with him versus Asami? The answer could be that it is a more mature love but it is different from any other relationship in Avatar. That brings me to the next point of contention because maybe it had to be different maybe the creators knew that Nick wouldnt allow it to be explicit. This would explain but not excuse the writing similar to Brykes explanation about the clipshow. I understand that it had to be there but it was still bad. Does Korrasami mean something larger than the episode itself thought? Is it about the legacy of now being able to show homosexual relationships in TV? I can certainly believe this but this is going to make all future shows better not this one. Anyways outside of word of God what does the material shows us? Well they could be starting a relationship which is my favorite explanation because to some degree it explains the chasteness they could be continuing one which we never saw they could be asexual partners or they could simply be platonic life buddies like J.D. and Turk. TLDR Zhurrick FOREVER!!!edit  Just in case anyone wonders I know that the implication is that Korra s bisexual but I am calling it a homosexual relationship because at the moment she is dating another girl. If that is not the correct way to address it then feel free to respond.,TheLastAirbender,cn11uuu,20,t5_2rybx

I am sorry you did.I loved the finale and the ending but am slightly irritated at bandwagon media coverage of Korrasami.  I get that people are excited about progressive TV but there are many media outlets that have ignored this fucking amazing show until this one Korrasami scene piqued their interest. And they only care about a samesex relationship being represented in a cartoon.  So they splash the final handholding image and write gay in their headlines and spoil everything.  Whereas we the fandom care about the journey and the characters themselves.  A bit frustrating.,TheLastAirbender,cn158ik,0,t5_2rybx

2624443,0,t1_cn12t1p,I think the ending was not ambiguous at all. I think they got as close as they could to implying Korrasami without stating directly. However I think that this post doesnt showjustify any buildup. It would be like me taking a bunch of screenshots of Mako and Bolin doing stuff together and using it to justify Bako. We all know its not even remotely close to a thing at all but the only reason this post has any pertinence at all is due to the fact that Korrasami was so readily implied so people see exactly what they want to see in these pictures. Its for this same reason that if I posted the album of Bako nobody would see anything and call me insane and rightly so.When these clips were played nobody read into them that deeply except for the blushing and the letter writing and maybe the driving scene but aside from those none of these images show much if any relationship other than friendship between Korra and Asami. But people see what they want to in these images and use that to justify their beliefs however thats whats makes their justification invalid because they ate projecting their emotions onto the images.Nothing wrong with Korrasami even if I wish it had ended on a different note but that is why I feel these images dont really mean much,TheLastAirbender,cn15gmo,12,t5_2rybx

2636624,0,t3_2psivt,I feel like Mako still being alone is doubling down on the moral paradigmimplied structure of the real world that this show so consistently presents when it can without Nickelodeon pissing itself. Hes not a bad guy he didnt deserve to be alone and its especially unfortunate that everyone else he knew pretty much was paired off and that whatever possible romantic intent behind his Ive got your back comment there was she didnt reciprocatethat isnt a punishment or social penalty its a legitimate recognition of two people who are demonstrably good human beings just not having the same feeling for one another which happens all the time and I feel needs to be shown more in media. We have this weird standard often in displaying romances where it either overtly works or doesnt just remotely work and little middle ground in common culture I feel. I really like that they included that remark and that Korra didnt reciprocate as anything beyond a friend because thats what reality is sometimes. And I also liked them showing him alone again because while this story is wonderful and most of everybody loves a happy ending me included thats just sometimes what happens. Sometimes you are lonely for no reason of you doing something bad or a set of personal failures or malice towards you you simply are by circumstance. Not everybody gets to get the girlguy at the end of every monumental step in which they would hope to. ,TheLastAirbender,cn2qn7u,1,t5_2rybx

2637417,0,t1_cn2u4d8,I dont think so. Honestly a better argument could be made for Wuko and they only had one season to work with! Or at least one side of the pairing!As I said Book  only had two hints and one was strictly platonic as far as the car scene goes. I have no idea how you get a romantic implications even if it were a guy and girl. What hurt their development more was that Asami was put into the background in a lot of episodes only given one line or not even talking! So how are we supposed to go from a moment between them in the first episode and another in the final episode with nothing in between and determine that as romantic?And hey Nick had their backs on this. Given the fact there seems to be no homophobia in the Avatar world there is no need for Asami or Korra to be lowkey and subtle because they are queer. That is simply a projection of the real world into a fictional world.,TheLastAirbender,cn2ud92,4,t5_2rybx

2637956,0,t1_cn2w3ik,Hes not questioning Korrrasami he just saying that Korrasami isnt end all be all. Things can change in the comics. The original post labels Korra immediately as Bi or Lesbian which is not always the case. He is right in saying that korra could be straight and testing Asami too see if things work out. I personally see Korrasami as a Pansexual relationship because love was built on their personality rather than their physical attractionas physical attraction first relationship seen with Makokorra and Makoasami. Overall the scene does the intended purpose of representing nonheterosexuals and that should be the important part of all it.Edit Added stuff and edited for clarity,TheLastAirbender,cn2wwc3,2,t5_2rybx

But all of them together clearly point towards Korra and Asami having a closer and more intimate relationship than any of their other friends.Korra and Asami arent just friends because then why single out Asami over Mako and Bolin? Theyre not really close friends because their body language towards each other is super flirty that one time Korra blushes is not the only example by a long shot. If you get to the point where youre saying Theyre just really close friends who flirt with each other! Theyre still just platonic! I dont see anything romantic here! you probably really are looking through a hetero lens.Take a look at the TV Tropes entry for Ship Tease between these two characters Thats not even a complete list as far as I can tell. ,TheLastAirbender,cnb1k17,1,t5_2rybx
2700718,0,t1_cn2bvzx,Id recommend watching some of it at least.  The characters have ironically human personalities.The first season is pretty tight the jokes are well timed the characters have exorbitantly cute designs this at least stays throughout and while some plot points are obviously recycled from other things most of it feels pretty original.  Even the setting feels like it could use some worldbuilding.Second season is about as good as the first with a brilliant beginning and finale at the end.Season three is... Not too great.  A few episodes are good but over all it is not the best.  There is a certain episode that REALLY reminds you that this is definitely a show for little girls. The plots feel more recycled and there is the much too sudden finale but hey all the other seasons have  extra episodes.Season four is alright.  It gets closer to the quality of  amp but its still not quite up to snuff.  However it definitely has the best finale try a giant centaur grand slamming a unicorn through a mountain.If you DO somehow get attached to the show you may wanna check out the Equestria Girls spin off movies.  st is pretty stupid but the second one is a significantly better with the additions of better villains.,TheLastAirbender,cnb27xt,1,t5_2rybx

Enders Game theyd be treading a lot of the same territory. ATLA and LoK already covered stories of war and genocide as well as personal themes of empathy and forgiveness. And in some ways it might be a step back for them. For example going from a full roster of strong female characters to an almost exclusively male academy where girls typically werent considered smart enough to get accepted. Not to mention the authors rather outspoken views might conflict a bit with the message Bryke just sent with Korrasami. There are probably some other works of fantasy out there that would be a better fit for Bryke. ,TheLastAirbender,cndxx77,4,t5_2rybx

2732867,0,t1_cneoxqp,I agree. However I think that Aang had even more pressure seeing how he was the only human capable of airbending in the world not to mention he was responsible for ending the A Hundred Years War. The existence of the art of Airbending was seriously at riskhuman airbending to be specific. With Tenzin he was the only one that could sufficiently airbend at the time of Aangs death however he was not the sole person in the world that had the ability to airbend because the instant Aang died Korra was born and she being the avatar could airbend....eventually. ,TheLastAirbender,cneprjb,3,t5_2rybx

2762225,0,t3_2rp833,I think bending is based largely on an incomplete understanding of the world around the characters  based on the four elements. As Guru Pathik says everything is composed of the four elements all the four elements are incomplete pictures of how the world works.Water is manipulation of hydrogen bonding at its core  an ability to manipulate things that are bound via hydrogen Water and Blood are two examples but Hydrogen Bonding is also part of what makes up DNA and the Proteins in our body  which as some of you may know constitutes the majority of what we consider important in the body Proteins are what make things happen in the body  DNA is the coding that produces these Proteins.On an existential level healing is propelled by hastening the construction of proteins and reconstructive elements within the body. Waterbending is solely a manipulation of Hydrogen Bonding in its various states  and allows the waterbender to change the element from ice to water based on structural changes by tightened or loosened bonds.People dont understand this though  theres no science behind Waterbending merely techniques passed down intuitively through generations.Fire is the manipulation of energy both potential and otherwise. It breaks thermodynamics as we understand it  Firebenders can dispel energy entirely calming matter around them or fueling through solar energy produced by the sun an excitement of said matter. During Sozins Comet the mass dump of energy into the atmosphere by the comets friction allows Firebenders to draw on the comets energy itself  a closer stronger source of energy than solar power.Firebenders thus have a natural affinity for causing fire  as thats the simplest application of energy. Lightning is different  you need to create a significant difference in polarity between yourself and your target  something which requires far more concentration.What Firebenders really could do if they wanted however is completely kill somethings energy  but the concept is alien to them. Energy is alien to them. They understand fire and lighting  because its real tangible  energy isnt tangible.Airbenders likewise control pressure. Wind comes from a difference in air pressure  airbenders can create serious differences in pressure between different areas  and do so through various means both modification of air temperature and physical pressure modification. Temperature modification is a big part of creating cyclones and air balls  while pressure modification allows for flight via glider faster pressure gradient under the wings than over and air attacks.When an Airbender strikes with a stave they physically collect air pressure at the end of the staff  and create a low pressure gradient at their target. Thats why Airbending strikes are usually very openfisted theyre pushing a clump of air at their target and its rushing after it.Airbenders dont really understand an absence of air  but they do understand wind and weather and temperature.Earthbenders are the hardest to quantify  they seem to focus on a manipulation of solid matter though they cannot manipulate solid matter in organic forms  like plants or animals. I believe this is due to the presence of water within them and their mass reliance on Hydrogen Oxygen and Nitrogen  all of which are too much like air and water. Stablestate or Solidus objects only  though masters can handle less cohesive forms.I think this is where the Earthbenders fail worse than the others  they see the larger picture but cant understand the forces behind it. While Firebenders could potentially nullify the energy in people to freeze them to death or Waterbenders could denature proteins in someones body  Earthbenders can theoretically do much of what the other elements do because they can bend all matter. They simply dont understand what matter is.Metalbenders rely on an incomplete understanding of metal. The Spritual Bridge you refer to is actually a more complicated understanding of physics and how they relate between the force used to bend and its relation to other types of matter.In the case of Metalbenders or Sandbenders they only understand earth holistically. As such they can only bend the mixture of matter found in rock finegrained with Sand or in small quantities in metal.As such if modern science were invented and if a bender developed sufficient understanding in those disciplines theyd be able to do far more than they have. Its my understanding that as Vaatu comes closer to reawakening at Harmonic Convergence science grows  more people become intelligent and creative  which drives the world into its technological revolution from the stagnation of Raavas time.As such people are coming up with advanced bending techniques  and theyre only going to get better and more advanced now that Vaatu is totally free. Perhaps a bender will be born that discovers the existence of various specific types of matter? One will eventually learn to bend platinum.Soon enough Earthbending will go from one of the weaker elements to one of the strongest  because it can manipulate almost anything if you spend the time trying to connect with various elements. This is just my theory however  and its obviously not what Bryke intended.,TheLastAirbender,cni1z03,8,t5_2rybx

Im a gamer and world ending problems are what I like to see so it just didnt feel fun in season  or  although I loved them just the issues didnt seem as worldending like in ATLA or season  LOKbut I do think best written villain was amon... he was interesting and dark and menacing.... and although I still didnt like that it was at the scale of a city instead of the world I loved him a lot toobut overall the whole worldending thing of season  was awesome to me D,TheLastAirbender,cnra758,1,t5_2rybx

2919470,0,t3_2thvv6,This show has really changed my perspective. Before I got into it I was kind of pooting around at school not knowing what to do with my free time. Sure Ive been a musician and I usually just ended up playing my drums but never did anything serious.I started watching Avatar and well everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. I became obsessed not only with the show but with how it was made. Ive obsessed over the music the art the animation the writing hell Ive obsessed over the production. Suddenly I wanted to be a film composer. Then I wanted to be an animator. Then I wanted to be a writer. Then I wanted to get into the industry. After this time of creative turmoil where I freaked out about my identity and produced a hell of a lot of art music and fan fiction. I got through that and it was a relief because constantly trying to be the best at all of it because I didnt know which one I wanted to do was hard.Now I want to be a film composer. Im writing so much music when I have the time since I still need to do well in school in case nothing works out.God damn Im supposed to be talking about the show! Well in any case this show has truly inspired me creatively. It truly changed my perspective my drive and it definitely changed the fact that I had never thought that much influence on me was possible.,TheLastAirbender,cnzyau1,1,t5_2rybx

2942651,0,t3_2tneez,I think it depends on the matchups so Ill go with the obvious ones.Aang vs Korra Well heres the thing.  Korra can metalbend.  Aang cant.  Thats a serious advantage to Korra simply because its the only thing Aang cant do.  Aangs advantage is the connection to his past lives.  Korras connection was severed BUT she still managed to fight Zaheer AND the poison without it.  That demonstration was simply how powerful she was not to mention she STOPPED the spirit vine cannon with her Avatar State.  Aang may have his connection but Korra is the stronger bender of the two she could bend THREE elements when she was  I repeat she TAUGHT herself earthbending and firebending when she was FOUR so that one would be close.  Due to Aangs active pacifism I have to give this round to Korra.The Gaang The Krew Mako vs. Zuko Okay this one will be fun.  Zuko is a badass.  Like no question.  His agnikai with Azula literally BURNED DOWN the capital city they were however using Sozins Comet so they were a more powerful than usual.  He can redirect any lightning shot at him maybe well get there in a second and he handily beat a master firebender when he was .  And then he learns the true meaning of firebending from Ran and Shaw.  Goddamn dragons!  Again Zuko is a badass.  Mako however is a probending firebender.  Thats a big jump from traditional bending.  AND he can shoot lightning as fast if not faster as Fire Lord Ozai.  Thats a challenge for Zuko seeing as he has only redirected lightning twice and didnt do it very well if Im honest.  I think thats where Mako has the advantage.  In Book  Air he zaps things left and right without hesitation.  If he can get the speed advantage on Zuko then I think Mako can win hands down but thats no easy task.  It comes down to the practice of firebending a naturally offensive style of bending.  So lightning vs. dragon firebending.  I say this one is a draw simply because whoever can maintain the offensive will win.The Gaang .The Krew .Bolin vs. Toph Metal vs. Lava.  My favorite character vs. some grumpy old ladystuck up kid who I also love just not quite so much.  Toph INVENTED metalbending just because Shin Fu said she couldnt.  She invented goddamn metalbending JUST BECAUSE some asshole was like Ha you cant do that. Lol.  She is without a doubt the greatest earthbender in the world.  Shes like Richard Sherman Im a Seahwaks fan and its Super Bowl week I can talk about them if I want to goddammit everyone thinks shes stuck up when she says it but its true they are the BEST and they can prove it.  But Toph also has the weakness of being blind.  While she is incredibly skilled at seeing literally anything that moves she camt see you if youre jumpingin the air or has difficulty seeing if theres no solid earth the sand in Si Wong Desert.  So how will she see if theres lava everywhere.  Im sure shell sense it like normal earth but will it cause her sight to act up?  Thats the determining factor.  Bolin however is just as badass as Toph.  Even if he didnt invent lavabending he literally got so good at it in a MATTER OF HOURS MAYBE MINUTES that he was able to take on and beat Ghazan the master lavabender!  So... Whadduya think? Bolins got some moves!   So is lavabending enough to beat the inventor of metalbending?  I dont think so.  While Bolin is good hes severely disadvantaged without metalbending.  Its a close one but Toph wins out.The Gaang .The Krew .Sokka vs. Asami This one seems pretty balanced at first glance but Im not sure it is.  Sokka always struggled literally since episode  with faster opponents.  Case in point Zuko Suki Ty Lee Mai Azula Piandao even Aang chasing Momo!  Asami is hella fast.  As in faster than the chi blockers who are faster than pretty much anybody.  Also her Equalist glove and combat training put her on an EQUAL anybody? no? okay... tier to Sokkas sword training with Piandao.  Sokkas an incredible strategist but Asami has the upper hand in combat.  Sokka goes down via electrocution.The Gaang .The Krew .Tenzin vs. Katara This matchup is a little weird.  Could it be better if it was AangTenzin and KataraKorra?  Maybe but who cares?  I made it like this cause I wanted to and two Avatars going up against each other would be cooler.  Deal with it.  So Mommy gets to take out her frustration with her sons obvious preference to Aang.  Lets run down the abilities first.  Katara is one kickass waterbender.  She demonstrated her ability to phase change water into icesteam on Zukos fire navy ship.  Then she was able to kinda bend plants in the swamp.  And lets not forget she is a bloodbender.  She fought to have it outlawed but she has that power in reserve.  And now for Tenzins powers.  Air.  That it?  Flight!  No wait.  That was Zaheer.  Spirit powers?  Nope Jinora.  So... just air.  Air is cool.  You can... breathe it?  Yeah cool.  BUT air is a powerful form of bending and if used correctly can beat any other element.  So all Tenzin needs to do is draw all the air out of Kataras lungs and... Syke.  That would be mean dont do that.  Okay serious time.  Katara has the advantage when it comes to variability but thats the nature of waterbending.  Theyre both masters of their craft and while air has amazing maneuverability waterbenders are all about turning their opponents momentum and and power back at them.  This one stays close for awhile but Katara pulls out the win.The Gaang .The Krew .TIEBREAKER ROUND!!!Lin vs. Suki I picked them cause they fit and were left over.  Easy.  Lin wins.  No explanation needed but if you absolutely want one here it is metalbending.The Gaang .The Krew .So the Legend of Korra Team wins in overtime.BONUS ROUND!!!FREEFORALL Everyone gets ready to go then as they charge Uncle Iroh swoops in stops the fight tells a proverb about a flower and death then makes everyone a cup of ginseng tea.So yeah.  Those are my thoughts.  If you liked it cool.  If not oh well.,TheLastAirbender,co2lcdg,2,t5_2rybx

2965903,0,t1_co4yfya,Im not an admin but a lot of these are easy enough to answer without even being one.Yes the river will be larger but theres no saying to how much larger it will be.  From what I heard the new map was world painted from scratch not upscaled from the original one.  Since its supposed to be four times larger.  Id just assume the river will be a different size perhaps even shape.Buildings will most likely be moved using World Edit which means they will remain in their respective proportions.  But that could be changed depending on how the admins move the bases for example... moving the claim in one big go... or moving the claim in various chunks.  If youre really that worried just tell them that you would prefer your base to be strictly copied over with its original size layout.World Edit does preserve items in furnaces and chests not so sure about item frames.The Towny plugin has a lot of economy related features.  Money is often used with plots and other unique features with Towny.  EDIT reworded,TheLastAirbender,co58lif,1,t5_2rybx

3008336,0,t1_co9klj3,gtYou cant judge anything based on this. Fandoms including the ones for this show are a bit over the top when it comes to relationships. As seen by all the shipping in this sub.Fair. Then just remove everything from my post execpt the final statement if Asami were male every one of these scenes would be conventionally romantic.Because thats true. We wouldnt have this discussion if Asami were male. No uproar no qualms about writing. With the alone time these two got throughout every book one simple switch in gender woul have solidified it.gtIf it takes a rewatch to see a relationship then its not well represented.This is an absurd point. I dont see plenty of things on my first watches of a lot of things. After you watch the Sixth Sense you notice tons of things when rewatching it. Or very nearly any movie even books with a reread.Not to mention you can still take my final point above if Asami were male their interactions would be conventionally romantic you likely wouldnt need the rewatch to see their relationship. Thus in this case its not the writing that requires you to rewatch the series its your own perception and social interpretations.,TheLastAirbender,co9t85i,2,t5_2rybx

3146165,0,t3_2w5d2v,I can address a few of the issues here.Regarding the scale of the map and transportation right now we have a roads plugin implemented. It allows you to use certain colored carpets to get speed buffs from. Obviously this doesnt make the biggest difference in the world compared to walking but its something for now. There will be transportation methods set up soon boats airships rails etc. they will just take a little bit of time to make. Setting these things up before release would have meant the server would have been down longer.Regarding emptiness we are currently working on building up cities on a separate server. It takes a lot of work to get lots of cities done particularly cities like Ba Sing Se and the Northern Water Tribe so people just need to be patient for those. If we wanted to build all the cities beforehand the server wouldnt have been up for another month or two. Shops are also being worked on. The biggest issue with shops is making a balanced economy and making them worth going to. Ive personally been working on these and I can tell you this isnt a simple task and it can be quite time consuming.Regarding teleporting one of the main reasons there is a cooldown on spawn in the first place is because of people using it to avoid death. We consider this a cheating but because there is no way to monitor that we needed the cooldown. However I do agree that  hours is too long I honestly think it should be around  hours or something. Its something that I could bring up with the other staff.Regarding unclear instructions I agree with this. I think we need a serious rewrite of not only the instructions but the server rules as well. I see too many questions about how to bend and use many other features. I will also talk to staff about this.Regarding turning south I have no idea what thats all about but Im pretty sure thats a bug thats being worked on. If not I will bring this up as well.I can personally guarantee that all of these things are being worked on its mainly a matter of having the time to do everything. We are all volunteering our time to make this server but we all have lives outside of it as well. Many of us are students or have jobs or have family obligations so even though we are a big team will still dont have time to take care of everything at once. If we decided to get everything done before we released the server wouldnt be up for months. I hope that my answers are sufficient enough but Im sure if I missed something other mods will comment. I now things are rough now but I promise you they will get better everyone just has to be patient. We are all trying to make this server as fun as possible for you guys.,TheLastAirbender,coo3hnz,3,t5_2rybx

3149039,0,t1_cooc6a4,Well this is a rather vague question but Ill try to answer it.Basically we have built the entire world of Avatar in Minecraft and given players the ability to bend an element of their choosing. To unlock new bending moves to become a master you need to finish quests not implemented yet so you only have a basic move.We use the Towny system so that players can make their own towns and live in the Avatar world and by design economics warfare and politics all play a role in the server.There is littleno teleportation so players must actually walk to where they need to go and work together to accomplish long term goals. RP is encouraged but is not enforced so its up to you in that matter.The server is in open beta so people can play but there will be development on the server happening at the same time so lag might be an issue at times. New content is added on a nearweekly basis.I dont really know what you want exactly so I just kinda threw down whatever I though of to give you some background. I prefer to deal with direct questions as opposed to giving an overview.,TheLastAirbender,cooe7ui,6,t5_2rybx

3161465,0,t1_copmod3,. So its okay for you guys to use the roads then as well using that logic? You have the same if not more towns and people than us. I dont want NE to have access to these roads because they have the most people and towns! See that logic? We just want a peaceful open road that if abused will be taken away from the abuser. No one wants a militarized road that denies access to people who have done nothing wrong.. Attack when necessary as in as a response to raids and attacks. Even then we usually just bolster our defenses rather than attack the raiders. New Empire led a LARGE attack against us recently and all we did in retaliation was make our base even more safe from attacks. We also have a peace with SR and are establishing  trade relations. And I have no idea what you mean by harrassing a NE officer.. You guys do use diplomacy but youve also randomly attacked people like Na Sing Se so much you literally drove them off their land and a town in NE even once attacked us  times in  day for no reason driving many in the ER to desert or not want to even come on the server. . What I was saying about this part was that we have experience on how to make a fast and logical road that uses the least amount of resources. TheAlliance is a  ish town in the Earth Kingdom with who we made a giant highway to using carpets to better trade relations with. Obviously this super highway  isnt only our project but we we have a lot of resources that can definitely help.NE always accuses ER of being this warring evil people while they go and attack our allies and us for no reason. All weve asked for from NE is peace and we get war.,TheLastAirbender,copon38,3,t5_2rybx

3521296,0,t1_cptazoi,I didnt think Korra was bad I just think TLA was better.  It had more structure.  Each season of Korra felt like the monster of the week in terms of villains.  And looking at each series you can clearly see that TLA was planned out from the beginning while with LOK its clear that they made it up as they went along.  But I guess thats what you get when you make something that was originally supposed to be like  episodes long into a series that is longer than its predecessor. ,TheLastAirbender,cptnjb8,3,t5_2rybx
3522146,0,t1_cptpdwf,Yeah but we dont see enough of it. For example It wouldve been cool if the UR Intervened at the South Pole to bring Unalaq into custody. It wouldve been an epic naval battle with both sides using Water Bending to fight alongside conventional Naval Warfare we never saw guns be we did see cannons we just never saw them used followed by an amphibious invasion. Earth Benders digging trenches and providing cover while Fire Benders attack directly and WaterBenders heal the wounded and Nonbenders work artillery tanks communications and so on. As they pushed in Unalaqs forces wouldve broken out their Mecha tanks and their spirit allies. UR NavyMarines Vs WaterBenders backed by Mecha and Evil Spirits. That wouldve been awesome. ,TheLastAirbender,cptr0og,17,t5_2rybx
3524712,0,t3_30l5hl,Overall I enjoyed the show but I also disliked a lot of parts.First of all Korra. She started off as an...interesting character. Far FAR too arrogant and stupid at first and then becomes a wannabe Aang with her own little depression story. I also felt that she is quite...stupid. Easily manipulated unable to kill an equally dumbass dictator overall just not very intelligent.Second there just arent any interesting characters in LOK. They are all...mediocre. ATLA had likeable characters such as Azula Iroh who was NOT likeable in LOK Toph Zuko Sokka even minor interesting characters such as Ty Lee and Mai. LOK has Amon and...Pabu? Even Amon became far less interesting at the end when he was revealed to be just some dumbass who uses bending but doesnt like it.Then season . My god I hated that season. A retarded flying kite for a villain stupid bunny spirits everywhere. They just took the awesome mysterious spirit world from ATLA and made it goofier than Alice in Wonderland. I absolutely hated that season.Season  was awesome no arguments there  awesome in every regard save one.Why the hell doesnt korra just wipe out the villains with the avatar state??? Shes afraid to die in the avatar state is not an excuse! She should know that she is much more likely to die when shes being dragged away if she doesnt use the avatar state she can use the avatar state in a quick burst to make the chances of her dying almost zeroSeason  was...bad IMO. Not season  bad but bad anyways. In my eyes the fight scenes turned from being about martial arts style elemental bending to bad CGI mechporn. Korra still deals with her sobby little depression story and for some unexplicable reason cant simply destroy the dumbest most arrogant smug bitch of a villain ever to exist.Then there was the finale. The ugliest mech I have ever seen vs the avatar who doesnt use the avatar state. It made no sense. No sense at all. And worst of all both Wu and Kuvira are alive as of the finale.So thats my little rant. Overall I wont say that I hated the show but IMO ATLA is vastly superior. Maybe there is also the fact that I was a lot younger when I watched ATLA and my perceptions have changed over time.Also I dislike how some diehard korra fans like to downvote anyone who dislikes anything about the show.,TheLastAirbender,cpu1jay,0,t5_2rybx

It still took him a lot of effort to accomplish it.Thats what people seem to forget the all the problems stopped as soon as Aang got the power. He still had to actually do it. It took a long ass fight he almost died several times and he had to win it before actually being able to instill this incredibly difficult process of taking away bending. ,TheLastAirbender,cq0jvtt,-13,t5_2rybx
3584527,0,t3_2qjerh,Yeah korra was very different from Avatar. My main problem was that the bending and action wasnt as big. In Avatar they had huge creative diabolical attacks while korra was just a bunch of rock throwing and fire puffs.Korra was also just a show where they were always on the go. Always a bad guy needing to be taken down and an urgent mission with little downtime. It was rare we got to see the characters bond and interact in lighthearted settings. Aang and his friends were so close you knew they were best friends. But korra and her friends were more like coworkers.I know I should not be comparing both series but when you have something as amazing as the first avatar series you expect the same quality for the next. If korra was the first series I would have never gotten into the show. It couldnt stand on its own.,TheLastAirbender,cq0v4o7,1,t5_2rybx

3605406,0,t1_cq2yz1i,I dont know anything about Good Luck Charlie but as for the others. Adventure Time voice actress Olivia Olson said Marcy and Bubblegum used to be in a relationship but she later backtracked on that statement.  The creators have remained quite on the subject so its still unofficial. The two guys in Clarence were just a one shot gags who dont even have names.  They are kinda confirmed as gay when a source revealed it was originally intended for the two to kiss on the lips but the scene was later changed to a more ambiguous cheektocheek. Sapphire and Ruby arent technically lesbians because Gems dont have genders.  However because the whole Gem race only has a single sex any relationship between two Gems is also a samesex relationship.  Ruby and Sapphire are pretty clearly depicted imo as being in love.

Refusing to kill her enemies if at all possible Mistress  GalaxiaOzai finding her one true love Tuxedo MaskKatara etc. And Usagi and Aang are super playful haha.Its fine if you want Aang as Minako though they are similar too and we all have our own opinions. ,TheLastAirbender,cq9wrby,1,t5_2rybx

Voldy says Harry has  minute to tell him as much useful information as he can and for each piece of info Voldy will spare one of Harrys friends. Harry is only allowed to speak in parseltongue because it turns out that Slytherin invented parseltongue to force his decedents to tell the truth to each other. Harry uses a few delaying tactics including threatening to blow himself and everybody up using antimatter. In the end he transfigures a nanofibre from the tip of his own wand and forces it to grow around everyones necks then he pulls.

4184714,0,t1_crwwuw5,Thats because unlike most Avatars Korra was trained from a young age in both water and fire and earth but thats not really relevant. Aang had trouble with earthbending because the tenets of earthbending are diametrically opposed to those of airbending which he had been trained in. As any athlete will tell you it is a lot harder to learn a new technique if it requires you to suppress what you have drilled into your body.

4187336,0,t3_38sqnb,I think Tenzin would win this fight.Kuvira doesnt have a lot of experience fighting airbenders and especially not an airbending master like Tenzin.

He would stay focused and calm the entire fight remembering what Aang tought him over the years.

4201541,0,t1_crxo28p,A lot of the results make exactly zero sense.For example Bumi should never have beaten Ozai. If there was anyone on the planet capable of defeating Ozai what the hell did we need the Avatar for? Why didnt Bumi just solo his way through the Firelords army and kick the crap out of Ozai himself? Ozai was probably the strongest man in the world after the Avatar  theres no way anyone except Aang could have beaten him from that period.This vote is stupid as hell too. Given we know for a fact that Kuvira is an even match for Korra what the people voting for Tenzin are essentially saying is that they think Tenzin could defeat endgame Korra in a oneonone fight....which I honestly think is ludicrous we see occasions that clearly demonstrate where even her nonavatar state bending is more powerful than his by the end of the show. Hell at one point she fires an airblast at the Colossus which looks to be about equal in size and force to the combined efforts of all the other air benders attacking it including Tenzin. ,TheLastAirbender,crz624o,2,t5_2rybx

4262920,0,t1_cs64152,everything on screen in television and movies was placed there by a person. This is even more important in animation when the assets are literally created by hand so putting in the island there took a lot of effort.  The ending shot works as a great ending because it shows Korra traveling and ends us with some context for the next episode but notice in the final shot we never focus on korra only the island.  I know we dont zoom in but the waver is very very intentional.  Zooming in may have felt too easy and the creators preferred the more subtle hang.,TheLastAirbender,cs65dxn,3,t5_2rybx

4271321,0,t1_cs6lvw3,I think it was done on purpose bending in korra is way different... in atla its more about manipulating the elements and using more flashy attacks in korra the attacks r precise and much more braulboxing in style..... like evreryone can do acrobatics with ease aha.. i think its just the bending has evolved and they dont need to put as much effort anymore Makes sense in my opinion they are living in a more modern era... you really cant use a huge tidal wave to attack someone in republic city lol,TheLastAirbender,cs73flp,0,t5_2rybx

I think it falls short of that but hopefully it is a somewhat significant inching forward. It has been encouraging how well the media and the bulk of the fans have embraced it. Sadly and unsurprisingly there are also plenty of people who have lashed out with homophobic vitriol and nonsense. It has been my experience that by and large this kind of mindset is a result of a lack of exposure to people whose lives and struggles are different from ones own and due to a deficiency in empathythe latter being a key theme in Book .

Ozai says that for trying to trick him hell punish her by making Zuko suffer and will treat him like shit even though he knows Zuko really is his son. spoilerLater Ozai pisses off Firelord Azulon by saying that he should be the next Firelord instead of Iroh because Lu Ten died. Azulon says that Ozai should learn the pain Iroh went through of losing a son and orders him to kill Zuko  which Ozai actually had no problem with.

I imagine there are a shitton of bomb ass chefs in the Fire nation with their acute sense of cooking temperatures and ability to keep stuff from burning inspiration from jet making Iroh use firebending to ignite the stove City of Walls and Secrets. Circus acts Ty Lees former groupies and the circus in which Appa performed.Azula The Boiling Rock Part  and Mako and Korra Endgame all were able to propel themselves up and forward with fire bending and Mako and Korra Civil Wars Part  were able to demonstrate the use of propulsion to imitate a jet engine. And again with her fight against Zaheer Venom of the Red Lotus from her feet to imitate his flight.Sparky Sparky Boom man and Plis combustion bending would be very useful for fireworks shows. Lightning generation could be EXTREMELY useful when creating clean energy and not burning the depleting fossil fuels. On the flip side of Lightning generation Lightning redirection during thunderstorms that could knock out power.Have you ever walked into a room and thought fuck its cold FIREBENDING. reduces your heating bill and if you use the aforementioned lightning generation...BAM  electricity bill.AND THE SEXUAL APPLICATIONS TO FOLLOW!

I recommend you get on it. Plus the ones hes written since now are great page turners too. New scarecrow has a good mother dies but not really Great Zoo of China has a really good fun action story set in one location throw back to contest and ice station and The Tournament was really interesting to read a actions thriller author try his hand at a period murder mystery. Awesome characterisation.I dont read books anymore since mobile internet but I can always smash out a Reilly book on holiday in a few days. On the topic. I think how I make reading his books so much better is I make playlists which I listen too as I read. One for talking one for chase scenes one for action scenes. One for stealth traveling etc. I use soundtracks from games and movies Call of Duty  Modern Warfare is the BEST seriously try find the track jeep ride chase and listen to that while reading say the chase scene in one of the Jack West Jnr books where they are trying to take off the Halicarnassus while being attacked on the runway. It times up so perfectly that you find yourself gripping the book.

I thought she parted the beam around them but I wouldnt think that would open a new portal to the Spirit World. Unless she didnt part the beam around them the way she might part water rather she tried to put it out the way Zuko in his first season Agni Kai braced against Zhaos blast and threw it around himself dissipating it.

5285375,0,t1_cvmuht2,Kay guys theres a lot of different answers to this so I am gonna put my two cents in as well. Bhumi is the Sanskrit word for earth or ground. When were talking about the Earth goddess we usually say Bhumi Devi devi meaning goddess. That directly translates to Earth goddess. Same thing with Agni Dev the fire god. We sometimes leave Dev or Devi off for short though after we have established were talking about the gods rather than just the things.The reason people dont worship these deities anymore is because honestly theyre not as fashionable to worship anymore. After Vedic times like before medieval era Agni was demoted to a demi god and so was Bhumi Devi. In fact the king of the gods Indra kind of the Zeus figure since he was in charge of thunder was demoted to king of the demigods as was everyone in his court in favor of the trinity of Shiva Vishnu and Brahma. Thats the short of it. Any other Hindus let me know if theres anything youve learned differently as of course I can only speak for myself and the kind of Hinduism and history I have learned.,TheLastAirbender,cvn9ocn,4,t5_2rybx

The true battle is to keep harmony balance and understanding between the peoples of the world. For instance Korras greatest struggle wasnt against Unalaq and Vaatu her greatest struggle was defeating Kuvira a human enemy who was just a particularly talented metal bender and Kuvira only arose through the actions of another human villain Zaheer. Zaheers own existence had nothing to do with Vaatus actions.

5443229,0,t1_cw7f5vn,I actually dont think we can say that Korra wasnt spiritual anymore. Dont get me wrong she clearly isnt a prodigy but I really think her main problem is that she is being taught by Tenzin who is terrible at spiritual matters.

5445727,0,t1_cw6onb3,I suspect part of the problem with the actors is that Shymalan is a horror director do hes used to getting his actors to tone down emotions besides fearetc.  He even said in an interview that he directed the movie like a paranormal thriller because thats what hes used to.  So all the humor and action got toned way way down because he wasnt willing to step out of his comfort zone. Then he cut the runtime by a lot so they had to toss in crappy exposition because he axed whole plot elements. He sounded like a guy who was over his head and panicking and so made a bad situation worse.  If he had taken directing cues from fantasy epic movies instead of paranormal thrillers we would have gotten a mediocre movie with some problems like racebending. Instead he refused to change what he did and we got a horrifying movie that killed the franchise on the big screen. ,TheLastAirbender,cw7qso6,1,t5_2rybx
5478410,0,t1_cwbmefz,Definitely the attitude. Katara doesnt constantly proclaim how great she is so I think people tend to forget. Taking on a master waterbender without any training? NBD  Mastering waterbending in a few short weeks? Doesnt break a sweat  Training the Avatar? Sure!  Also learns healing. Shes a master martial artist and a doctor!Can tell the difference between ink and water without thinking about it  Plugs up the drill and still has energy to knock over Sokka  Uses waterbending to cook and serve food directly to mouths   Octopus fighting form wo breaking a sweat  Splits the ocean then walks underwater!Also freezes ice quickly enough to skate around a moving sea monster then freezes the sea monster. Fights Azula  her master earthbending Dai Li minions  Takes about  minutes to learn bloodbending vs Hamas years  Takes down massive warships  All while riding herd on Aang and Toph and Sokka  not easy!Katara does way more than we see Toph do  Toph is definitely awesome but shes not overcome half the problems Katara did.   Katara just doesnt brag as much.  Shes clearly the equal of Aang in waterbending and probably surpasses him in the more delicate work. ,TheLastAirbender,cwbx203,8,t5_2rybx

Probably one of the best lightening benders in the world and the leader of the Triple threat triad.  ,TheLastAirbender,cwdjlxj,0,t5_2rybx
5511822,0,t1_cw60y0g,Yeah since the Avatar isnt there eventually the other generals would probably take over for General Failure I forget his name. Either he summons them right away since he doesnt have the Avatar unlikely  he obviously hated admitting weakness or someone notices something is up and removes him.  Either way probably our heroes never hear about it.The White Lotus has one good reason to head for Ba Sing Se  its the largest city in the Earth Kingdom and already has a lot of traffic going towards it which makes it a great place to meet up and start looking for the new Avatar. Probably not meeting in the city but nearby. JJ wants to get closer to the Water Tribes Katara wants a waterbending master so probably they both want to go north anyway. He also might realize she and Sokka represent an in to the Southern Water Tribe so theres motivation for him to want them on his side.  Sokka will probably go with Katara unless he thinks that returning to protect the village is most important  I can see them having an argument and Katara winning with weve already come all this way and we can protect them better with waterbending.   I think both groups start moving independently and meet up on the road.  That short circuits any question of JJ trying to send them back to the South Water Tribe and would also let us handle the Gaangs reaction to Aangs death prior to meeting with JJ.  Plus I didnt think JJ was living near Pohaku so we would need to account for the distance somehow. Having both groups converging on a destination is probably easiest. What is Appa doing  does he stay with Katara and Sokka or does he take off for the temples or something else? If Appa stays with them it could motivate Jeong Jeong to travel with them flying is easier and quicker than walking if Appa leaves for the temples it could be a reason for Katara and Sokka to want to travel with JJ who knows EK routes. Kataras motivations at this point are learn waterbending protect her loved ones and revenge. Shes probably scarily focused on revenge by this point and convinced that Fire  Evil. How does JJ convince Katara hes not evil? JJ doesnt have a problem with their ages in the series and hes a Fire Nation soldier.  Hes probably more focused on training them to protect themselves than locking them somewhere safe.  Does Jeong Jeong promise to convince a northern master to teach a woman fighting? Does he tell Katara that shell only get healing training and she secretly vows to learn fighting also? Or do they make a pact to thwart the sexism of the NWT together since the Fire Nation is genderneutral?  After they start traveling together we get in a nice transition journey where Katara and Sokka and Jeong Jeong can explore their issues get used to each other and all the other plot elements can be set up for whatever happens in Ba Sing Se and trying to get to the NWT to search for the new Avatar.  What does happen near Ba Sing Sewhen meeting other WL?  I wonder what changes for Iroh and Zuko? ,TheLastAirbender,cwg6oi6,1,t5_2rybx

5595489,0,t3_3rrcts,I love Amon and Tarlocks death scene though I still cant believe Nickelodeon let it fly.Im particularly fond of Tenzin and Zaheers brief oneonone airbending duel. It shows how utterly outclassed Zaheer really is at airbending.Yes hes an incredible airbender but from a philosophical standpoint this is what allowed him to fly. He fights and to some extent even move with it like its an extension of the nonbending martial arts that made him so dangerous before he had bending and while effective its just not an ideal use of airbending. He doesnt land a single blow on Tenzin and only the interference and aid of the rest of the Red Lotus allowed him to get the upper hand.,TheLastAirbender,cwqo8i4,13,t5_2rybx

The ATLA finale has shown that even a few dozen Fire Nation soldiers could burn down huge areas with the comets boost to their firebending. Airbenders on bison were probably easier to catch back when they had dragons.The people of the air nation are also the most easilyrecognizable because of their appearance mainly their tattoos and cultural practices like vegetarianism so hiding would be difficult. We dont know for sure if Aang actually is the very last airbender but he is the last known airbender. Because of the airbender genocide its highly unlikely that any surviving airbenders would ever come forward and reveal their airbending.,TheLastAirbender,cxkgn6b,6,t5_2rybx

What does one need to know going into Smoke and Shadow thats not in Rebound?  That Ursa is back and Azula has disappeared? spoiler  An observant reader can gather that fine based on context and dialogue.  While they would need to know about the Maiko breakup from the Promise spoiler that was a dumb plot development then so its not like they get points for it.

Regardless there is a prison equivalent in the Spirit World.    The Fog of Lost Souls. Korra could throw him in there and that would take care of it. It might be a little fucked up but he is a confirmed murderer who also orchestrated the attempted murder of the Avatar. And theyve alluded to more Red Lotus members out there which means Zaheer is still a potential threat.    A Korra vs Zaheer fight set in the Spirit World could be quite interesting. Unless they really want to play up the NeoMatrix connection with Korra in the Spirit World in which case she wouldnt have to do much other than port to him grab him and then throw him in the fog.  ,TheLastAirbender,d0pxbii,1,t5_2rybx

I assume it like this A square is a rectangle but a rectangle isnt a square.  At any rate chi and chakras can both be closed or stopped.Its no coincidence that bloodbendingchi blocking that Amon did is right on the Light Chakra. Not only that but air bending and spirituality are closely knit together to the point that Jinorah can spiritually project herself in the real world. Remember when Aang was hit by Azula with lightning in the back he was hit in the th chakra as per the writers of the show.

I left a couple of ends open and I want to close them.gtDynmapgt Whether we will actually release the dynmap to public access after we actually are certain that its working properly is also something we are not certain about yet Ill bring it up in our next admin meeting to get an answer for you with regards to that. We will release our custom version of the dynmap to public access whenever its ready and if it doesnt receive negative feedback from our playerbase. If it does receive negative feedback from the playerbase for example with regards to privacy of their town location we will just turn it back to private and merely use it to assist us in creating builds on the build server.gt Townygt Interesting idea. I never thought about this myself but I can also see some downsides along with the positive sides. Ill also bring this up in our next admin meeting to see what we can do.Buying plots to extend your town was denied for a specific reason if we allow this to happen rich players will start claiming a lot of places throughout the entire world. If we make it cheap well run out of any space we have left in the world. All islands are pretty much claimed already and space is pretty valuable. Wed rather keep the space as valuable as it is now. If we make it incredibly expensive it wont have as large of a benefit for players to really gain something from it.  If we try to find a middle point well run into both problems at the same time. The real way of fixing this is to try and get more players through publicity and more features on the server which as you can see we are really doing our best to make happen. We appreciate your patience as more builds are finalized and new features are being worked on!gt SandbendersIll return to this once I have an answer its turning out to be a very complex issue.,TheLastAirbender,d12piui,2,t5_2rybx

Most of the corrupt spirits were fairly menacing and remember when Wans spirit pal mutated that guys face?  I do agree with that.  I did feel slightly unsettled by that plot. Something about having two avatars back to back that broke records just for the sake of it being an interesting tv show just seemed cheap. Aang a monumental avatar was Korras predecessor and now shes severing the avatar reincarnations and opening spirit portals etc?That said I still did enjoy the book overall.

7543734,0,t3_4in6jk,To me it focused too much on the Avatars backstory and spirit world shenanigans. I was very cool with having a little mystery there and I didnt really like what we wound up getting. I thought the reveal that a Spirit of light was driving the Avatar made the position feel less human less personal.Plus I thought the main plot was a little too... magicky. Spirits and bending and magic are obviously superimportant aspects of the show in all the other seasons but the others seasons all had main arcs driven by humans and emotions and politics and the spiritual stuff served the main arc. Whereas in this one it seemed the other way around  the politics seemed to serve the spiritual stuff.,TheLastAirbender,d2zop8c,3,t5_2rybx

7770430,0,t3_4loej5,I would generally recommend to start with TLA but the beginning is a bit slow. Having said that I got one of my friends to watch TLOK first after a small explanation of the world by me first since I figured they wouldnt appreciate the slow start of TLA as much. Some people happily watch many episodes before deciding whether to watch a show some only watch one or two. TLOK is aimed a little bit more at an older audience so it was easier for me to get this particular friend interested. After watching TLOK he became open to watching TLA and enjoyed it a lot. So I guess what Im saying is that you need to cater to your audience.

7786610,0,t3_4lyaj7,I think part of your issue may be this hindsight. Regardless of everything else the GAang wasnt so sure they could defeat the Fire Lord.  So we shouldnt act like oh yeah Hokado was gonna be let out for good behavior or released later.  Its more than love for Sokka. He sees himself as the last warrior of a tribe that left him behind to protect the vulnerable. Add that to the invasion plan which he conceived and operated imprisoned practically every ally that the GAang has ever known including the last bit of his family.  He and Korra already lost their mother to the fire nation  if he can save his dad at any cost its worth it to him. Hes a realist.  He doesnt know if the GAang will win a world war.  Aang was barely a firebender and Toph said he still needed more practice earthbending  thats not very impressive nor uplifting when it comes to a deadly deadline. Its not confidence booster.

Right now there are four full books out in order of release The Promise The Search The Rift Smoke and ShadowAnd coming later this year is North and South with part  due in September. Plus there are also three FCBD short comics released the last few years taking place at different points but all postseries two of which can be found on Dark Horses site the  one youll have to find a scan of since that comic was included in a book that also had a Star Wars comic which Dark Horse no longer hold the rights to.All these take place AFTER the series and more or less take place in chronological order. All of these are written by Gene Yang with oversight from Bryke. IMO they do feel a bit off overall at least at first since they arent written directly by someone who worked on the show but theyre still great reads and I feel like some elements of them are actually better handled than they were in the show. And Bryke do give notes on everything and make sure its all above board.There is also the compilation of oneshot comics called The Lost Adventures that take place DURING the series written and drawn by all kinds of different people.There will ALSO be comics continuing Legend of Korra coming later this year or possibly early next year depending on how much theyve been delayed which will be written by cocreator Michael Dimartino himself. There arent any full comics out or even fully detailed yet Dark Horse have said therell be news at SDCC but there was an excellent FCBD page comic written by Mike and illustrated by Heather Campbell that released a little over a month ago called Friends For Life.You can read that here for free if you sign up for an account and there are plenty of scans available but the one at the link is official and the best quality youll find.,TheLastAirbender,d49b1b1,1,t5_2rybx

However my favorite season is season  of TLOK. The episodes of the origins of the first avatar were amazing and beautiful in animation music story and dialogue.

8271277,0,t1_d5bfaok,gt It made me think about the subtle difference between the phrases The world needs your help and You have the ability to help the world. Throughout the series Korra is told countless times that The world needs its avatar and although the sentiment and intentions behind the phrase were good it didnt quite mesh with the whole Be your own person message. Yeah I think Korra and her relationship towards her own identity is a complicated issue. She is the Avatar but shes not just the Avatar you know?. I think the key is her agency. For example she may have been born into the role but at the end of season  she made a deliberate choice to become the Avatar just like Wan did before her. I think when some characters those closest to her use phrasing like The world needs your help they really do mean the latter You have the ability to help the world with an implied the world really could use some help right now. Im reminded of the conversation that Korra has with Asami and Tenzin in the clip show episode. Korra is expressing her doubts but Asami and Tenzin remind her of all the good Korra specifically has accomplished so far. Near the beginning of that conversation Asami saysgtThe World does need you. Youre the Avatar.Its subjective but to me that reads like the latter version when taken in the context of the whole conversation. The world needs help and you are the Avatar you have the power to help it.,TheLastAirbender,d5bgvq8,2,t5_2rybx

8308434,0,t1_d5fq3xx,gtAlso not to open up a can of worms here but KorrAsami was a rushed mess...Plus there was a distinct lack of foreshadowing that in my opinion just turns Korra and Asami into token bisexualgay characters.I find this perspective interesting. I read the ending scene as basically embarking on a first date an acknowledgement of some growing romantic feelings. How much more foreshadowing would you want for that? There were many scenes in season  that showed how well they got along many read as a bit flirty too lots of people watching. I think more importantly there were a few key scenes that showed how deeply theyve begun to care about each otherYou have their ending scene in season  when Asami offers to be there for Korra if she needs it. Korra opening up to Asami in Korra Alone. A very interesting set of scenes in the reunion episode when Korra and Asami meet again with a very warm embrace and a blush from Korra followed by their little spat at dinner that shows some tension between them because of Korras absence. The finale scene is a callback and parallel to their scene in the Season  finale though flipped around this time with Korra comforting Asami. We even get an apology from Korra about her absence in reference to that previously mentioned tension. It was definitely played much more subtle than the straight relationships Which actually made it work better for me personally I think too many of the relationships on both series often relied a bit too much on old tropes. A lot of this is definitely due to the restrictions of what they could show. But for what the ending scene read like to me literally the start of something romantic I felt like there was definitely enough build up. Also why do they feel like token gaybisexual characters to you? When I think of token characters I think of characters like Loras in GOT. Almost everything about his character revolves around him being gay and only the fact that hes gay. LOK did nothing anywhere near as insensitive as that.,TheLastAirbender,d5g3zyh,8,t5_2rybx

8443626,0,t1_d5wqgb2,Keep in mind that Korra giving people their bending back was just reversing Amons technique which doesnt take bending but blocks it so severely it is basically permanent. Amons technique is just reverse healing where instead of channelling chi towards water and an injury to heal he uses water in his opponents body Via bloodbending and channels chi in such a way that he permanently blocks chi paths in the body we assume he has strong knowledge of chi paths and chakra pools given that he knows how to block different elements.We have never seen an Avatar make a nonbender into a bender like the Lion Turtles can do. They seem to have a mastery over Energybending we have never seen in a human.

8602907,0,t1_d6glaxx,Alright... where to begin...Ive downloaded all the files you mentioned  including the cuDNN.dll from the NVIDIA website.I am using a source that is already upscaled from x to x. Id rather use this once since it barely has any weird interlacing or ghosting issues makings things much easier in the end for me.Your command line seems to work. Kind of.I tried using the following line    ffmpeg i DEP.mp r . DFOLDERd.bmpAs you might be able to tell I renamed my footage to EP and the folder is simply called FOLDER. No invalid arguments or anything like that. Works just fine.Now things go wrong when I press enter. Instead of converting all of the frames to .bmp format it only seems to convert  frames in total. Do you have any idea how to fix this?Edit alright I think what you are trying to do is divide  by the framerate per second right? In this case that would result in .. For some reason it doesnt seem to work properly when I hit enter. However when I divide  by the outcome of   .  it somehow does work as intended.Second edit I just finished processing converting one full episode to .bmp images by using my lessthanideal command line method. Its around  individual images  GB in total. Luckily Ive got a  TB external HDD so it shouldnt really be a problem.As for Waifuxcaffe it works fine. Takes about  seconds to convert a x frame to x using all of the settings you mentioned except for the magnification which I changed to .x. The overall quality although barely noticeable is indeed better. Background imagery looks normal and the individual details are slightly better. I havent started messing around with the model settings yet.Anyway lets say I get all of this to work properly. I now have a folder with k .bmp images. How would I convert all of those images to an .mp file again including the audio?Also Ill need a lot of help when it comes to those model settings. How do I apply line sharpening and whatnot?

8813463,0,t1_d7774vi,I think Im confused. Even if were basing this off of the limited perspective of the other characters which still would include Roku since Aang witnessed his training in a flashback how does that make a difference? We see the respective growth curves of three Avatars. Korra arguably still mastered the elements at least faster than Avatar Roku. Even considering the fact that Korra started training at a younger age than Roku she still took less time to master the four elements on the whole. I dont know exactly how long it took for Roku to get over his waterbending block but I think it was implied to have taken at least a year. Korra once she unlocked her Airbending seemed to master it in no time at allcomparatively Aang struggled with Earthbending even after unlocking it so much so that he never was able to learn metal bending.  And to be honest I think the only reason it only took him a day to unlock his earthbending was because of Toph being immensely talented at provoking people into losing their chill. Not even a live and let live kid like Aang could put up with her sass anymoreexactly as she intended.Anyway all Im saying is that I dont think Korra struggled the most out of any other Avatar to get over a bending block. But we can agree to disagree. A lot of this is open to interpretation anyway. For all I know Roku might not have taken as long as I thought to master the elements. It depends on how old you think he was when he finished his training you know?,TheLastAirbender,d779b7y,1,t5_2rybx

8846940,0,t1_d7b9nj2,The four nations dont quite fit from a lore standpoint.The lore of Warframe is a bit flaky and told in bits and pieces but from what we have gathered so farThe Orokin are the big posthuman super civilization that laid the foundation to everything in the origin system. They created most of the tech we use in the game. The also manufactured the Grineer as an easily expendable slave race for dangerous manual labor. At some point they wanted to expand beyond the origin system and created the Sentients and sent them on their way to do the hard work but the Sentients came back and were mighty pissed. The Orokin then created the Infestation a plague that attacks biological as well as mechanical targets indiscriminately in order to fight back. When that ultimately failed in an act of desperation they then created the Tenno who were so powerful that they needed proxies in order to maintain control over their powers warframes in order to combat the Sentients. It worked for the most part if it werent for Natah an undercover Sentient disguised as an Orokin. Natah ultimately became the downfall of the Orokin and laid waste to their civilization.So the four civilizations in this scenario would probably be Orokin Grineer Sentients Tenno.

9046458,0,t1_d7z7p5p,gtthis is all well and good but can you make the same connections to LOK?I never claimed that LOK followed that format only AtLA. They may occur in the same universe but they are very different shows with different styles of writing and directing. As such they need to be analyzed independently. However in this case I will argue yes. Yes we can.We may not know who Korras bending instructors were except for Katara and Tenzin so we dont know what kind of relationship she had with her Earth and Firebending teachers. However we do see the theme of Old and New employed in Book I when Korra struggled with Airbending. She had clashed with Tenzin initially because he insisted on Korra focusing on classical Airbending techniques. However it was only when Korra sought out a new context Probending that Tenzins lessons of ducking and weaving began to stick. Having access to old techniques and new ideas on how to utilize them played a role in helping Korra move like an Airbender.,TheLastAirbender,d7z8myp,1,t5_2rybx

The struggle here wasnt can Aang win? because we also know he could win.  The Avatar is a powerhouse.  The struggle was can Aang win without killing his opponent?.Aang decided he would do everything in his power to avoid that and he was given a boon by one of those entities who exist in the world that is massively stronger than him.That is a good deus ex machina.

9915234,0,t1_dayqmgd,They butchered wildly changed the world the original series established which made it hard for lots of ATLA fans to get into. Not to say that change is bad but there was a lot of change. The pacing was awkward at times. Only twelve episodes with no real filler. Filler is important everyone needs a breather. The pro bending was cool but after like the second episode it overstayed its welcome. I liked that it helped her learn grasp the airbending movement but that was in like the second or third episdoe and they still had to have her go to matches and shit even when the Amon plot was in full swing. They set up a mystery of Who is Amon and how can he take away bending? and answered it with an unsatisfying reveal. They also broke the rules for bloodbending and Im still not sure how you he actually affected bending with it. Personally I did not really like most of the characters especially early on. It wasnt until later in the show where they stopped feeling like poor amalgamations of characters from the original show Bo Lin especially. The ending was dumb. I like Korra losing her bending which was the catalyst for her airbending and becoming a fully realized Avatar? but getting back her bending was handled poorly. She just runs off sad she cant waterearthfirebend and then Aang shows up and saves the day. It wasnt fulfilling. Its like they wanted to do the whole thing from the beginning of Book  but didnt have the balls or Nintendos permission. ,TheLastAirbender,dazz97g,1,t5_2rybx

10068206,0,t3_5jv20t,The finale to The Last Airbinder is very good but not perfect. It is dragged down by two deus ex machinas and the several loose ends that took years to be answered. gtMy buddy said that people didnt like the giant lionturtle showing up and changing the rules. I personally liked it. More myth the better?The thing is while the existence of Lion Turtles is foreshaodwed with Aang finding the picture in Wan Shi Tongs Library what happens in the finale and the power that Aang is granted is not foreshadowed at all.The problem is that it renders Aangs moral choice and his struggle in this finale pointless. The Lion Turtle showing up out of the blue adding to the shows mythos doesnt undo any of these problems.The Lion Turtle isnt the only deus ex machina that shows up in the finale. The other one people forget is the rock that somehow restarts the Avatar State when Aang is losing his fight against the Firelord. As for the other problem with the finale is that it didnt address several long standing threads such as where is Zukos mom Tophs relationship with her parents the fate of Azula etc. Back after the finale aired I was convinced that these threads where never going to be addressed at all. I think the finale could have tackled these threads to make them more satisfying. Besides these flaws the show and the finale were amazing. ,TheLastAirbender,dbjwrzz,4,t5_2rybx

Other times Ive seen criticisms of characters take on completely over the top and vitriolic positions describing Korra as an abrasive bitch for example or the frequent worst avatar ever. LOK has plenty of flaws I think it has a few more prominent ones than ATLA actually. However a lot of people on this sub view ATLA uncritically too.

10365842,0,t3_5ocokh,S was held back by the stupid love triangle like can we not start off series with the drama of love for once? Other than that it was pretty good in story wise I loved Amon and the realness of his threat.S was yea just awful spirits being in the real world kinda didnt fit well with me and neither did the story. I didnt even really like Wans story like cool its the story of the beginning but plot wise it wasnt AMAZING like people make it out to be. Raava and Vaatu as colorful kites didnt help either. Spirits just being closer to humans made them lose their uniqueness imo.S and  were great tho loved them. But.. all the seasons fail to be anywhere near as good as Avatar and I dont blame them you cannot match a masterpiece but it was a great effort. Something about it being too heavy and ATLA having a great balance of seriousness and lightheartedness with an overall lighthearted and joyful tone made it great. ,TheLastAirbender,dcj13p7,4,t5_2rybx

10399887,0,t1_dcmw6cs,STATUS   YearsThe Fire Nation is forced to use fear to maintain their rule in many parts of the World including the Southern Water Tribe and large swaths of the Earth Kingdom with their numbers significantly depleted. By this point the entirety of the units sent to the Northern and Eastern Air Temples have been destroyed. The Northern Unit was wiped out in the first siege of the Northern Water Tribe while the Eastern Unit was slowly picked away by Earth Kingdom Warriors. Nearly  of the Southern Unit has fallen with  of that lost in the invasion of the Southern Water Tribe. Another  was lost during the siege of the Southern Tribe Capital and the rest has suffered at the hands of Earth Kingdom Soldiers after being moved onto the mainland. The Western Force is the most intact having suffered only about  losses however due to the extreme losses on other fronts the unit has been split up with only about  of the original force remaining to lay siege to Ba Sing Se the other  has been diverted back to the south to continue the conquest of the Earth Kingdom and siege of Omashu. Much of the reserves have been sent out to replenish numbers but at this point time is the enemy. Time for a new generation of warriors to grow up time to train them and send them into battle. All the while their enemies are doing the same. Meanwhile no one has found the Avatar. They should now be  if they survived the initial onslaught. This should make the Avatar a Master Water Bender and well on their way to Mastering Earth yet no one has heard any word of this individual. The longer the war rages the more likely the Avatar is to enter the war. The fire lord is paralyzed with different options for the Avatar weather they were in the South or the North. A Northerner  would indicate that the Avatar is alive but likely untrained in anything but water given their isolation. How long can the Northern Tribe hold the Avatar back however? A Southerner most likely means the Avatar was killed as an infant during the invasion but what if heshe somehow survived where could they be hiding on that island and why have they not struck given the lower numbers of fire nation troops there. If the Avatar did die in the invasion that would make the Avatar an Earth Kingdom resident. Was the Avatar living under Fire nation occupation unknowingly were they in Ba Sing Se or Omashu receiving training. Are they fearful to make a move having no access to a Firebender to instruct them in the next element? What if the Avatar was killed a third time as a member of the Earth Kingdom? Is the Avatar back within the Fire Kingdom is heshe slowly biding his time until they can finish what Roku started and kill me?As a result of this the war effort continues to slow down under Sozin and remained at a slow simmer during Azulons reign. The split focus of conquering and maintaining control of the rest of the Earth Kingdom maintaining control over the Southern Water Tribe remaining vigilant of any attack from the Northern Water Tribe laying Siege to Ba Sing Se and Omashu and keeping troops stationed at all corners of the empire looking for the Avatar drained much of the manpower held by the Fire Nation. Only in the last  years of the war under Fire Lord Ozai did the Fire Nation again begin to press the offensive launching a second unsuccessful siege of the Northern Water Tribe and achieving success in finally breaching the walls of Omashu and then Ba Sing Se. Despite this much of the Earth Kingdom had squirmed out from under their control through various resistances as well as what appeared to be the first signs of the Avatars influence on the War. ,TheLastAirbender,dcmw6ry,6,t5_2rybx

10619102,0,t3_5ryllv,Lion turtles gave people the ability to control the elements. In Beginnings they never even call it bending.Dragons badgermoles the moon and sky bison taught people bending technique the use of an element as an extension of ones body. They even show Wan learn firebending from a dragon in Beginnings.The original benders do not grant people the ability to control elements they demonstrate how to use the elements as an extension of ones body. For example by observing badgermoles humans learned that the power to manipulate earth could also be used to create elaborate tunnels like in the story of Oma and Shu. Toph learned from badgermoles who are also blind that she could use earthbending to sense things around her.After the lion turtles stopped giving people elemental powers these abilities were passed on to the children of people who had these powers. People were born with the ability to control the elements instead of having to be granted the ability by lion turtles.

10704333,0,t1_ddjz39h,Ill just touch on a few things as well.gt Are you forgetting when the main character became a  foot tall Kaiju in ATLA?At least that made SOME semblance of sense. Aang became a proxy moon spirit on account that he is part spirit himself and then combined with the ocean spirit. Korra becoming a giant spirit version of herself is completely out of nowhere it just happens with no explanation. And somehow shes able to take on Vaatu using just her own spirit which shouldnt be possible.gtShe used a light spirit to speed up Raavas regeneration.Theres no precedent for that and its never mentioned or explained again. gtPermanently blocking their chi paths.How? Once again no precedent or explanation for how it works. Its even more confusing at the end when Korra is able to airbend after her chi paths were blocked did Amon just miss those specific pathways somehow? Also Korra is given her powers back by Aang ENERGYBENDING them to her or spiritually giving them to her or whatever. The show explains her inability to bend as physical paths being blocked off how would a spiritenergybending be able to restore them? Bloodbending shouldve been the solution realistically.gtThe world where she was suppressed as a kid by her parents and decided to give her own kids much more freedom than her parents gave her.Okay this is actually pretty realistic. Do you know what it isnt? Satisfying storytelling. In ATLA the seeds of character development had been planted to suggest she was slowly becoming a more selfaware and grounded individual. Watching her character regress in Korra sucked even if it is technically possible for her character to do so.,TheLastAirbender,ddk2m5s,4,t5_2rybx

In ATLAs case you can argue that there are barely any filler episodes at all since most of them give a tiny bit of character or story progression.But they are hit and miss in my case. I dislike The Great Divide because the parties involved become way too annoying. Over the top annoying.Same goes for The Painted Lady.

Killing Ozai would have been a phyrric victory.In the end it wasnt about Aang being the Avatar. It was about him becoming his Avatar.Korra built on that theme.

11041888,0,t3_5xo9gj,Basic Timeline of Events Zuko and Aang declare an end to the hostilities and propose a recall of Fire Nation Troops from the Earth Kingdom. Zuko announces governmental reforms for the Fire Nation notably an elected council of ministers that can check the power of the Fire Lord. He encourages the Earth Kingdom to adopt similar reforms. As Fire Nation troops withdraw from Ba Sing Se the lack of governance from the Earth Kingdom capital becomes apparent. Large swaths of the kingdom become lawless with others falling under direct dictatorial rule of local governors. Eventually Ba Sing Se comes under the control of a council of governors representing a coalition of former Earth Kingdom Principalities states. They initiate the arduous task of reuniting the Earth Kingdom and reclaiming occupied territory. Meanwhile Zukos announcements are met with starkly different responses. While many are glad to see the war end most Fire Nation residents feel betrayed by Zuko for relinquishing conquered territory. Veterans families accuse Zuko of ignoring the blood that the nation shed to obtain those lands. The Fire Nation economy is at the brink of collapse as inflation soars bolstered only by exporting vast quantities of coal steel and manufactured goods.  When Zuko proposes that the colonies be returned to the Earth Kingdom there are protests in the streets. The announcement is seen as the final straw for Fire Nation troops abroad. Four separate armies as well as three naval groups completely defect. Lead by defecting generals these armies lead to a series of juntas among the southern colonies overthrowing the colonial leaders appointed by Zuko. With the loss of ports in the southern colonies and domestic problems Fire nation generals stationed in former southern air nomad and earth kingdom islands take the opportunity to defect as well. These rebel governments are largely conservative ProOzai military dictatorships. They are not united by anything other than a desire to restore the Fire nation to former glory and constantly fight amonst each other. The strongest of these Fire Nation Remnants is the Federation of the Southern Colonies FSC which controls a vast area of the earth kingdom from the capital of New Ozai formerly Omashu. Aang and Zuko call a council which eventually decides on the formation of the United Republic of Nations. The move is still unpopular but Zuko reassures the people that the Fire Nation will have a strong influence on the formation of the new nation with the blessing of the Avatar.  North Earth Kingdom territories are still not under the control of the Ba Sing Se government as a result the Earth Kingdom pleads with the Northern Water Tribe to assist in the invasion and management of these territories. The Earth Kingdom hopes to reacquire the occupied areas and to annex the northern air nomad islands. The Northern Water Tribe is more than capable of invading and administering these territories and says it will relinquish the lands under the condition that they will immediately be part of the new United Republic. This is merely a ploy as they know this will not happen and begin establishing Water tribe hegemony over these territories. Zuko orders the invasion of several islands controlled by remnant forces under the pretense of protecting shipping to the southern Water Tribe. In reality he wants to strengthen control over strategic fishing grounds and to put down the remnants. These islands with large populations of nonbenders in the absence of the air nomads chafe under the reestablishment of Fire Nation occupation. Large revolts of nonbenders begin here. Armed with muskets molotovs hammers pipes these protestors overwhelm the thinlyspread Fire Nation troops leading to a full evacuation on one island. Inspired by the success of these protestors nonbender insurgencies spring up in former airnomad territories to repel occupying Water tribe Fire Nation or Remnant forces.  The borders of the United Republic are drawn largely aligning with the former colonial boundaries.  Within a decade the FSC declares war on the United Republic invading its southern border. A coalition army of UR  and Fire Nation Troops meets the invading forces. Aang steps in and stops the invasion through a show of force. The FSC troops retreat not wanting to incur the wrath of the Avatar. Aang is disappointed that the United Republic has not brought peace as he had expected but the fledgling nation is quickly becoming a booming crossroads of technology and trade. While the Fire Nation discovers how to utilize electricity first the UR is the first nation to adopt a national electricity grid. The FSC not wanting to directly attack the UR finances and supplies nationalist rebels in the south of the UR. Zuko can no longer commit troops to the protection of the UR and the Earth Kingdom is unable to help due to the massive strain of the postwar reconstruction and modernization. The UR loses a quarter of its territory to the nationalists. Amon gains notoriety as a nonbender vigilante fighting the fire nation nationist rebels in the mountains at the frontier between the UR and FSC. Meanwhile a nonbender government has formed in the former northern air nomad territories. Nonbendermajority regions of the UR and the Water Tribe occupied areas threaten to and then succeed in seceding to join the nonbender government leading to the UR losing another quarter of its territory. Nonbending unity movements lead to president Raiko being elected president of the UR.    Aang dies under mysterious circumstances. Korra is born.,TheLastAirbender,dejku78,1,t5_2rybx

If the white lotus group is still around and involved with teaching and protecting the new avatar Id guess at least one of them has read enough history books or had past experiences so theyd know orange eyes  dark avatar.

11331693,0,t1_dffpm86,I always liked the idea of multiple origin myths. Nobody is  sure what happened.Plus different tribes could have learned from different sources. Maybe the very first benders learned from the turtles but the knowledge didnt spread everywhere or the secrets were guarded. Later different tribes did learn from the animals and these styles spread more freely thus the myths are more prevalent in the modern world. The Fire Lord suppressing all knowledge of the dragons teaching fire bending gives credence to the idea of forgotten knowledge in the world. This could also explain why energy bending was forgotten. The original benders learned from the turtles but kept the teachings secret and guarded. Thus their styles were all lost to time along with the origin of bending being the turtles. ,TheLastAirbender,dfgffh9,10,t5_2rybx

Good show and its positive in that true friendship is better than letting blokes get in your way and if you want to read more in to it crack on but I never really thought they were in a relationship as much as they were two strong female characters who outgrew petty but he should love me instead emotions. At least for Korra because Asami never really seemed like anything but a decent human being.

11634121,0,t1_dgemkdn,Personally I dont think Painted Lady was a filler episode or anything but I do dislike it because the takeaway message seemed to be that Katara was right when frankly Sokka was.  I get wanting to help the village but like you and Sokka said they had more important things to do.  That wasnt the only village suffering under the Fire Nation and if they stopped to help every one theyd never get around to defeating the Fire Lord and the whole world would be doomed anyway.  Not to mention the fact that the soldiers could easily come back after the Gaang had moved on.I assume they went the route they did with it because its mostly a kids show which stops it from going too much into moral ambiguity and cynicism but it still irks me.,TheLastAirbender,dgeqnqh,21,t5_2rybx
11640744,0,t3_65ydic,While I think there is a couple of episodes which are maybe average or okay by avatar standards I think there are maybe  or four episodes I dislike by avatar standards. Those episodes would be The Great Divide Bato of the Water Tribe I believe the one where Aang hired the letter from Sokka and Kataras father and The Headband. You could maybe add The Cave of Two Lovers Jet Serpants Pass and the Painted Lady but once again maybe. But all those episodes I think are good but only bad compared to the rest of the series and would definitely watch those in a rewatch with maybe one exception. That being the Headband. Its the only episode Id even consider skipping when rewatching the series. ,TheLastAirbender,dgfhpox,1,t5_2rybx

In Aangs take down of the firelord he demonstrated an ultimate power the ability to take away bending. I think this power may have cowed the fire nation as much as the deposition of its leader.,TheLastAirbender,dghvtql,3,t5_2rybx
11665234,0,t3_66g2rr,Yes the loss of her connection to the past Avatars is horrible but thats what makes it good storytelling. It shows us that even though we know Korras not gonna get killed off these antagonists can still do serious lasting damage to the protagonists. The fact that it hurts to see it gone for good means that they got the audience to genuinely care about it.gt The avatar was never a warrior but rather a protector. They were so much more than just someone who could bend all four elements they held the balance of the world on their shoulders. The avatar was never interesting because they could bend all the elements they were interesting because they represented something much larger than themselves. This is why aangs struggle to be the avatar was meaningful. By taking away the past lives the avatar became nothing more than an OP bender.I disagree. Korra didnt lose the responsibility of keeping the world in balance when she lost her connection to her past lives. Wan didnt have any past lives to guide him but he still did what he could to protect the world. Korra did too in Books  and .gt Like I mentioned above it weakened the concept of the avatar so while Korra grew as a character the avatar became nothing more than some person.I would say that it challenges peoples preconceived notions of what the Avatar should be. It tells us that being the Avatar isnt about being able to bend or having past lives to guide you its about their duty to protect the world. A big part of Korras journey throughout the series is learning that.gt LOK is a separate show from ATLA I get that but by destroying Korras connection the show also threw away its roots in the original show. Something can be inspired or directly taken from another thing while still being original and I feel korra did this. But by taking away the connections the original show felt inconsequential. They didnt take away all the connections to the original show though. We still had some of the old characters as well as their descendants play important roles in the story. Tenzin and Lin in particular do a pretty good job of keeping LoK connected to ATLA without overshadowing the new generation of heroes. Katara and Book  spoiler Tophspoiler even as recurring characters are pretty important at certain points in the story too.,TheLastAirbender,dgi9pi0,10,t5_2rybx

11728058,0,t1_dgpbrs8,Depends on how you measure earthbending.I mean tactically yes I agree Bumi is better. Hes far more experienced in a fight and I think he uses the same philosophy that Toph uses in earth bending which was why someone like her was recommended by Bumi to teach Aang earth bending I believe. Add the fact that hes not blind he definitely has an advantage. But the measure of an earth bender isnt solely on fighting. Remember bending isnt mainly for combat its for art and industry as well. Shes the best because she could figure out metal bending. Nobody knew how to manipulate metal and you can see that people would use metal against Earth benders like the cages used to hold both Toph and Bumi. But because of her focus and interpretation of earth bending she was able to open up a whole new field of earth bending. This lead to the police force of republic city consisting of mainly metal benders and Suyin Beifong helping to start Zaofu a city consisting of mainly metal. All this because Toph started metal bending. Thats why shes the greatest earth bender because she revolutionized it.idk about Iroh and Ozai.
