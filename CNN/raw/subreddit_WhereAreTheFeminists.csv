751321,0,t1_cgpna77,I recognize the Demmian name. When I first joined reddit I started out heavily posting to SRS and SRS discussion. I logged on one day to find myself prebanned from those subs. ,WhereAreTheFeminists,cgpojr4,8,t5_2umhp
786798,0,t1_cgto5ip,I was also involved in this trial run and have not yet been banned again!Edit Banned.,WhereAreTheFeminists,cgtpohi,7,t5_2umhp

855954,0,t1_ch1gjbw,None of that was intended on my part.Looks like I inadvertently upset another mod. My apologies. ,WhereAreTheFeminists,ch1ksa1,0,t5_2umhp
1125575,0,t1_chknxfv,I was banned from rfeminism and felt bad for it at first is my username developed from a feminist webcomic really that problematicmisleading?  but as time goes on Im just increasingly disappointed in Demian and Reddit in general. ,WhereAreTheFeminists,chw8ic7,1,t5_2umhp

1842032,0,t1_ckb2ok8,That is good to know. That sub sounds like a joke.,WhereAreTheFeminists,ckb5tl5,1,t5_2umhp
3293482,0,t1_cp3nwwj,Always a good idea to look at this post to see what its like to mod under this dude.I think a dude holding the top mod position of basically the default feminist sub is hilariously wrong. Only on reddit. ,WhereAreTheFeminists,cp3om8b,6,t5_2umhp
3303484,0,t1_cp3yiso,gt Not banning users for what they post in other subreddits seems very rational actually.Wrong. Someone makes a rape threat in another forum a mod here sees it and bans them from posting here? Thats totally rational.,WhereAreTheFeminists,cp4tnz3,2,t5_2umhp
3385708,0,t1_cpe64zs,Wow. He is such a paradox I just dont understand. He seems relatively well versed in certain feminist topics yet those screenshots are pretty damning  he has identified as an MRA in the past. Im just so confused is he pretending to be a feminist or does he truthfully believe he can be both?,WhereAreTheFeminists,cpe744u,4,t5_2umhp
3394481,0,t1_cpekvb5,I too was banned I guess for replying to you in a nonnegative manner. Im really glad I found this sub to get an explanation and also kind of vent over what happened.,WhereAreTheFeminists,cpf74gs,4,t5_2umhp
