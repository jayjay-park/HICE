5943209,0,t3_3wq7ok,Im plat  just about the same as you. Hardly any pinks except near objectives before team fights so it makes flanking pretty hard. Usually my team mates clear out pinks when they go to ward themselves so its usually not an issue typically top lane has more pinks Ive noticed.

7710851,0,t1_d3in7w4,Personally I think the last one is the most interesting despite being a normals game. Once I finished Hextech gt Lich Bane gt Deathcap he couldnt jump on me until I used my full burst on a different enemy. Notice how I kill him at the start of each team fight at the same time stopping his snowball with his greater lead and items. ,EvelynnMains,d3io7ck,1,t5_38tok

8038955,0,t3_4pbjqq,If you already own them I would suggest trying them out in a few normals. If you can make it to level  with enough HP to gank with HPlvl seals theyre definitely a better option. But if taking HPlvl seals will force you to base after  camps Id stick with flat armor. Its not worth sacrificing that timing window which you can easily use to snowball yourselfyour laners for the relatively small and significantly delayed benefit youd get from HPlvl seals.,EvelynnMains,d4jnjsg,2,t5_38tok

8395550,0,t3_4uklhi,As soon as you finish your Runic Echoes you can solo dragon pretty easily  but ONLY do it if you see the enemy jungler is top or backing to base otherwise youll get killed and have it stolen.Usually when I finish the Echoes Ill buy a pink ward for the drag and gank midbot. If we kill anyone its essentially a free dragon except ADCs are assholes and half the time theyll try to keep farming instead of following the call. If you gank bot clear the lane ASAP with EQ and ping dragon like a madmanI prefer focusing on bot because ADCs scale better and you get dragon control but it depends a lot on who are the top laners who are the supports who is trading more how much CC how much mobility etc.,EvelynnMains,d5qzoao,2,t5_38tok
8439700,0,t3_4v91vt,It depends on the enemy team comp. If they have a lot of burst its a good idea to get a Guardian Angel alongside with your burst items Ludens Protobelt Lich Bane Rylais.

9054829,0,t1_d803l07,Yeah the lower ADAP and the assumption of longer fight makes thunderlord not so appealing and other keystones are emerging.

10683394,0,t3_5suh6x,I use it in ranked Sheen gt Stinger gt Phage more CDR  more damageSteraks improves your Sheen procs by a ton.GA works very fine if youre fed.If you get CDR in runes you sacrifice damage early which I dont like you cant get Maw because of the CDR cap. Take AP blues and leave the option open. Better first clear  more ganks more invades better first back. Unless I die i usually back after getting  gold. Also Blue Buff puts you at  CDR with just Warrior Tri.First clear should be imo buff  wolves  buff. You can do it leashless leaching HP on raptors and end up on full hp. Then gank then backgo back to farming.Also pink wards notice you the range is just smaller and you can see the ward if it sees you.Edit Just check my op.gg there is all info you need. Also Bork is the best damage item for AD Eve.,EvelynnMains,ddhwtcr,2,t5_38tok
10684288,0,t3_5sebd3,step  kill the invaderstep  take their jgStep  kill them againseriously though as jg its your job to keep up with the enemy jg so them invading shouldnt be a surprise if they do also its not a completely bad thing if they do invade.  if they are invading your jg then they arent ganking a lane just dont let them kill you and if you can smite the buff from them or kill them after they take it. ,EvelynnMains,ddi04u3,1,t5_38tok

10721570,0,t3_5tcb2g,Dont even get Nashors without Lich Bane. If we take into account both items as a standalone Lich Bane is the superior choice better build path noticeable spikes in damage allaround good stats. Nashors suffers from an awkward build path and some stats which are only really good if you are already with some AP built beforehand to boost the ratios on its passive and to combo with Sheen.If you take Nashors Tooth as your next item after Lich Bane your E will apply both Sheen and the onhit magic damage passive from Nashors twice which really adds to her burst damage. Nashors is also really good to boost Evelynns sustained damage on fights with nonsquishies as well pushing objectives and sidelanes. The CDR is hella good too.While Jungle Evelynn will most likely be forced to build around the teams needs ie playing as a Diver and not as an Assassin Lane Evelynn should get Nashors as soon as possible to add to both her sustained and burst damage. But only after a Sheen item. ,EvelynnMains,ddlumvp,6,t5_38tok

11050464,0,t3_5xropd,Eve doesnt really benefit too much from most items in your build. CInderhulk sucks early you need a whole bunch of hp to make it worth its gold and why would you even pick Eve a champ with  hard cc if you want to play a tank. GLP is better than RoA imo but why would you even go for a catalyst item at all? Go echoes and you will have all the mana sustain youll ever need. Flat mana isnt needed on Eve. GLP has a nice slow i guess but then again Protobelt is waaaayyyy better on Eve. The active is better the build path is great Revolver is a great early game spike on Eve even tho its cheap as hell and it offers more burst than GLP. Liandrys isnt really a core item on Eve flat pen is really mediocre now that her E deals physical dmg. Even haunting guise isnt that valuable on Eve imo Sheen is better imo. Eve can build pretty much anything but the most consistent build would beStalkerSkirmisher Runic echoesProtobeltTier  bootsLichbane  Iceborn Lichbane when you get fed iceborn vs heavy adAfterwards go for whatever you think is usefull. DMP is great imo go Rabadons when you are really far ahead and think you can carry Rylais if you need to stick to targets and so on. Also dark seal is really good even if you dont get stacks you get like  gold for selling it later and given its stats its easily worth to get pretty much every game.,EvelynnMains,dekjudu,0,t5_38tok

11390459,0,t3_62fcb6,Rylaindry as you name it is a good combo altho i havent used it lately. Rylai offers some very cheap stats but it feels like the passive isnt enough to justify it for late game. Maybe against a heavy tanky team and you taking the role of more team utility player. When playing AP the better option is do the maximum burst or you are going to receive even larger damage.      I havent played AD bruiser either lately but i never found Frozne Mallet to be a good item for Eve. Gauntlet is much more cheaper for this purpose. Its slow is serve more purposes. The item also helps with mana sustain. It overall gives very cheap stats. It can be fit better with the other good items for bruiser Eve imo. You are likely to already have enough HP coming from items like Titanic Omen Visage. Taking Mallet you would need to adjust your build maybe excluding Titanic cus it becomes too expensive and you would want extra CDR. ,EvelynnMains,dfn38jd,1,t5_38tok
11419011,0,t3_62yicx,They can see you if the brush is warded. If it isnt youre safe. If the brush is warded you have to watch your detection range. So a good tactic is to have a sweeper and sweep the brush before entering you can use the sweeper from outside detection range in the bot lane for example where your support could have as well done it so they never know.Shaco clone spots you I dont know about Morde puppets.,EvelynnMains,dfqc06s,1,t5_38tok
