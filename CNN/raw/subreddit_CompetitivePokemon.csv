4740524,0,t3_3fe2r0,I thought that the blue pentagon was supposed to indicate whether or not a poke is legit though Ive read that there are ways to get around it.  I mean I havent seen one without the pentagon so I dont know either way.That said Im fairly new to the competitive battling deal and I do breed for  perfect IVs and desired natures.  I see it as the natural way to play the game and it gives me something to do while I mindlessly watch youtube.Some good related news is that competitors in esports are now going to be randomly drugscreened so implementing stronger anticheating measures for popular games like Pokemon probably isnt far off the horizon.   ,CompetitivePokemon,cts35ve,2,t5_2v3db
