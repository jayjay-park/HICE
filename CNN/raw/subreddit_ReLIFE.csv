6663147,0,t1_d08bfwj,Im actually just about to finish orange one the last chapter. It is definitely quite different in some ways but still pretty good read.,ReLIFE,d08iyxc,2,t5_37bgs
8324015,0,t1_d5hyj6t,Ohhhhh thats a great idea and would make the story less cliche. Woold make sense since in a way this is mostl her ReLife.,ReLIFE,d5i228r,2,t5_37bgs

8550744,0,t1_d6a719g,Its an esports organization called Team SoloMid people frequently chant TSM at their games and its kind of a meme since it just gets spammed randomly now.,ReLIFE,d6aeyub,3,t5_37bgs

9162554,0,t3_55psev,I hope that the actress that plays Hishiro will be able to pull of the quirks of hers like her listless voice awkward smiles and Icarenobodyinthisworld look.Getting these  a pass and surely this will be great!,ReLIFE,d8df5oj,2,t5_37bgs

10402093,0,t1_dcmyb6t,Yes it would and really I dont think the ReLife company actually has the ability to delete memories anyway. It seems to me like that is just something they tell their subjects to try to prevent them from taking potentially damaging actions.,ReLIFE,dcn572k,3,t5_37bgs
10500545,0,t3_5qcw7w,As the others have said I started at the beginning. The anime did skipchange some things and Im glad I went back and read those as it gave me a better appreciation of the characters. ,ReLIFE,dcyciz2,3,t5_37bgs
10521007,0,t3_5qnsxf,ReLIFE is an online manga created specifically to be viewed online like this though Im sure theyve made physical copies afterwards. That explains why its in color since they dont have to worry about printing and the continious layout.,ReLIFE,dd0o4fh,13,t5_37bgs
10915912,0,t3_5vyj0l,thank you ,ReLIFE,de5wdno,2,t5_37bgs
11168006,0,t1_dexuhgs,The other interesting detail is that if ReLife institute does posses mind wiping technology  why not use it on the subjects? Remove the memories which does hurt person and do not allow him or her to move on and BAM  the person is good to go. Much easier and far less risky. I understand that author may do things in story for the sake of story but to this moment I dont have any points for that. The plot is mostly logical even if a little bit cheesy.,ReLIFE,dexvr4q,1,t5_37bgs
11498787,0,t1_dfz2zya,Cool Im almost done with the process. Seems easy enough.Only trouble I seem to be having is with Wireshark. The filter I entered doesnt seem to be working I dont know if theres something I am doing wrong. Android Emulator working perfectly fine however. Am I suppose to link the two programs together somehow?As for Photoshop I have it so thats not an issue since I dont the images downloaded at the moment just wondering how I should go about putting together the images. Is there certain dimensions I should set or do you just adjust the canvas size as you add more pages together?,ReLIFE,dfzdya4,1,t5_37bgs
