6358016,0,t3_42qlf1,Why hasnt anyone tried this before?Asides from channels like Chilling Tales for Dark Nights and dramatized audio versions of existing comics or books I have never seen an independent author try and do something different with the way their story is distributed. Thats when I invented the term audiocastId written a book called Im No Superman and Id tried to get it published for years but with no such luck. I also have a YouTube channel which was lacking content. The idea came why not combine the two and try do something different?So my book is now a weekly audioweb series. Each week a new chapter is released. Until it finishes obviouslyIm No Superman tells the story of a young boy from London who loves parkour. When an accident leaves him with the ability to control energy he then uses that power to become better at parkour rather than become a superhero. The question it poses which I think is really important is this. If you woke up with superpowers one day what is the first thing you would do? Think about it would you use your powers to help others or help yourself?Thats where this idea came from. And I hope people like it. ,Newbwriters,czcc3y1,1,t5_2tic2

Thats one of the painful parts of being a writer  you have to do all this world building and research and then you dont use  of it in the actual story. But YOU knowing those things will lend an authenticity to your worlds and characters that readers will notice. I recommend setting a time goal instead of a words goal but honestly just do whatever works for you!,Newbwriters,dcj47mc,3,t5_2tic2
