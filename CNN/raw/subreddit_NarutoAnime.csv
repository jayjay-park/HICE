1683547,0,t1_cjqp7p6,He has a lot more of a forgiving. Heart then I ever would to compliment Danzo instead to saying the same thing Naruto said to pain peace? Justice? Dont make me laugh. You killed my family condemned my brother and you sit on your throne speaking of peace. Or something like that is what Naruto said to Pain.  Sasuke should have said the same to the Kage.,NarutoAnime,cjrdh3z,1,t5_2toum

11789758,0,t3_6872qw,For example the character i like the most after Naruto is Shikamru. Although his laziness is second to none but there are are enough reasons for him to be my favorite characterFirst he is a genius .In the series his ability to form plans and plan tactics in the most difficult of situations was second to non and controlling shadows seems cool to me.Second even if he is rarely motivated to do anything but when he focuses on something then god help his enemy. He destroyed  Hidan singlehandedly for murdering Asuma  thats the proof for his focus.Third his aloofness gives a cool look that rivals both Kakashis and Sasukes. Also he was the only one to be promoted to chunnin even after loosing the match and on his first attempt. ,NarutoAnime,dgweq3x,5,t5_2toum
