If we listened to foreign fuktards like you we would be still fighting Prabhakaran. This is OUR country  we shall behave the way we deem it fit. We dont need uneducated foreigners to give us unsolicited advise on how we should govern our lives. Now go and blow up some poor helpless middle eastern country to stone age and the preach them the virtues of western civilization. We Sri Lankan prefer to not to be enchanted by your call to make us civilized even if your spread your legs to us. I hope you continue to get abused like hell from other Sri Lankans.

642462,1,t1_cgd26mk,It is the OHCHR that will inquire...what is still unclear is how much power she has if she has any judicial power at all. The resolution calls for the investigation of HR violations not war crimes crimes against humanity genocide. Ex Pakistan has tabled a resolution against the US for human rights violations and has asked UNHRC to investigate and regulate drone strikes. US replies by boycotting the resolution and replying We just dont see the Human Rights Council as the right forum for discussion narrowly focused on a single weapons delivery system They know the UNHRC has cant do anything. Also Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statute so they cant prosecute us. The only thing that can happen is for individual countries to impose sanctions travel bans etc.,srilanka,cgdar6g,0,t5_2qh8a

2929963,0,t3_2tp7pv,I think right now our issues are more psychological than anything else. Hopefully the return of Malinga and perhaps the hiring of Stephen Fleming as a consultant will help overcome the worries. The seniors are doing well to place a platform on which we can build a good innings. If Mathews gets going then we have a good chance of building decent partenships and then Perera and J Mendis can play freely with less pressure towards the end of the innings.Meanwhile I reckon our bowling is pretty good if we didnt keep forgetting our line and length after the th over. Mendis could impove to keep the scoring down.It all depends on how we gel together in the World Cup. The good news is Sri Lanka has a history of doing well at major tournaments so maybe we can make semis. Its hard to predict yet though.,srilanka,co15cn6,3,t5_2qh8a

5789056,0,t1_cxedbj5,Do you believe that hes trying to internally divide Sri Lankan peoplepromoting division in it? If so its not what hes doing hes condemning the British for using this strategy.Hes said that all the Europeans used that strategy on colonial people either favoring one minority andor importing other people.gt That led the French colonists to admire their fighting spirit and use them as native auxiliaries in the usual European way to keep the big tribe the inland Sunnis in their place.Acknowledgement of something is not pandering. Lets review this quote from another article of his one where he champions Kurds in Iraq fighting for Christians gt The Kurds whod come through a nightmare century with remarkably little hatred for anyone as far as I could see didnt buy this at all. My Kurdish students as fine a group of people as Ive ever met used to say at every opportunity I have Christian friends! I have Yazidi friends! I have Turcoman friends! I have Shia friends!gt I guess if youre a middleclass American I have minoritysect friends sounds sort of patronizing. At least when I told people back home about my students boast of intercommunity friendships the kewl leftists among them sneered a little like Oh thats just like whites saying my black friends.gt Which frankly made me want to break a latte glass over their heads and cut their throats with the broken base. No it isnt like that slack Berkeley clich about my black friends it isnt like that at all. I just wish Americans would stop assuming every place is like us. Let me tell you for a Sunni Kurd to say I have Shia friends I have Christian friends is about as brave and radical as it gets short of suicide in the Middle East. I never heard any of my Saudi students say anything remotely like it. Well how could they? By law Shiism and Christianity are banned in the Kingdom. So they didnt have the opportunity even if theyd had the mindset which they didnt.That doesnt sound like someone who likes ethnic divisionhatred.,srilanka,cxeoqmq,0,t5_2qh8a

8155502,0,t3_4qem0l,It wont work out. Both of you will be better off going your separate ways.  Most Srilankans are pretty judging and conservative as it is. Add Islam to that and you get an even more reserved group even the moderates. There is noticeably less socializing between muslims and other srilankans as it is. So how would you expect a foreigner to fit in? And in a marriage no less.   If you were to go through with this you both will have a pretty toxic life. The family probably wont see you as part of them. There will always be a bit of prejudice and most likely even racism. Theyll assume things like he married you for money etc I know its pretty narrow minded but that is how the general consensus is unfortunatelyOn another note  In Islam its allowed for a man to get married to a JewishChristian woman. Even with that people tend to be pretty intolerant. And if you convert there will always be the story that you converted for him and not for Islam.  Dont walk into such a negative life.
