He has published numerous times on vasovagal syncope but I do not think you are understanding what is written. The vagus nerve does not travel into the extremeties period. If you are interested in learning more about the vagus nerve I suggest perusing through Wikipedia or even Grays Anatomy Hyperextension through the knee is not common. I highly doubt youre noticing a significant number of people doing so in your gym unless you have a goniometer and have people stopped at the lockout. Are people getting to  degrees full extension? Likely. Are they going past that? Doubtful and its even more doubtful that youre picking up on tiny subtleties without having examined hundreds if not thousands of knees. ,Brogress,cpbaqh5,1,t5_2ys92

Its that core dedication that I wonder about.  Plenty of people try and fail and fail and many never succeed but the people of this forum are showing quite well that they have succeeded. While there are many different reasons Im sure for those successes I guess Im trying to gain some insight into what has been the motivating factor for some of you guys to make you really want it vs. just kind of wanting it.The shit that makes peoples so fed up and ready for change that theyll do any fucking thing they possibly can to make it happen and they wont stop until it does.  Dont know what has brought so many to that particular breaking point.I know too or at least believe that theres to some extent a psychological reward that I and others get from seeing and being a part of this forum and seeing others be successful like we have done it ourselves even though we havent.

8658169,0,t3_4yg6sz,Fellow palebro here. Great progress. Visually its a lot harder for light skinned guys like us to see the true progress. Its why Bodybuilders get tanned for competitions.    As you have seen its possible to do a recomp where strength and muscle is gained and fat is lost. People are telling you to go bulkcut route but Id suggest you keep running your current setup untill it stalls because its a lot harder to recomp at higher age and greater fitness. Save the bulkcut cycle for when you no longer are making gains and dont be afraid of turning into a chubster again just because you were once fat.,Brogress,d6nvx4k,3,t5_2ys92

9371935,0,t1_d8x5ejb,Thats the point of my comment...ease up. Its easy to over think weight lifting. Its much harder to simplify and condense it to core movements and good solid nutrition unprocessed meat fruitsveggies nuts seeds. Im only speaking for myself of course but overthinking has often let to mental fatigue stress and finally failure with new concepts and fresh habits.,Brogress,d93yjz3,0,t5_2ys92

9606513,0,t1_d9buojd,Very reasonable number at that height and weight IMO. Hes strong but not ridiculous. Thats actually my goal for the end of this academic year   squat  deadlift  bench  plate OHP.Currently Im at  lbs and have a  bench  squat  deadlift. I know if I just keep eating and maintain my slow  routine I should be able to get to my goals within the  months I have left. Although I have to admit I feel like Im really stalling. I set PRs maybe once a week but theyre miniscule improvements and OHP is getting worse.,Brogress,d9x76r8,1,t5_2ys92
