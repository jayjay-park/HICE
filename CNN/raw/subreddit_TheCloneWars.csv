519175,0,t1_cfz944p,why not? they offer some of the same videos. youtube and hulu just happen to be ad supported. the site i linked to is as free. or at least adblocker works and i dont see any ads. theres no difference between someone uploading tcw to youtube vs any other streaming site except that youtube will plug their ads into it. any content be it a tv series music movies whatever can be easily found anywhere on the web. you being high and mighty because you pay for your netflix subscription doesnt make you any better than someone who goes to another site to view the same content. for every person like you who pays their subscription fees there are just as many people who dont for whatever reason. either they cant afford the monthly fees they dont havecant get a valid credit card to cover the fees or theyre just cheap ass freeloaders. does that make you better than they are? no. you keep on paying for your subscriptions. ill keep finding stuff for free. ill be a cheap ass freeloader who has better things to do with his  like being a single parent and watching stuff for free,TheCloneWars,cfza8o7,-2,t5_2vt4o
521295,0,t3_203m61,They werent worried about public relations rather that all support for the Clone Wars would vanish the moment everyone found out that the leader of the enemy had the Clone army created.  If everyone found out that the Clones were really a Separatist creation the Republic would be doomed to fall.Their only course of action was to try and win the war before whatever Dooku was planning came true to do otherwise would mean certain defeat.,TheCloneWars,cfziy0s,3,t5_2vt4o

Oh yeah btw Luke  your Dad built CP and RD has saved my life a dozen times.The real answer is It was never originally intended to have a gigantic backstory spanning multiple mediums when ObiWan said clone wars that one time in A New Hope.,TheCloneWars,cgtvaw4,6,t5_2vt4o

933280,0,t3_249374,I know its not possible but it would be cool if they includedMortis as a map just imagine the quick change of seasons and time it would make an interesting dynamic like when the storm begins everybody should find a place to hide because storms there are pretty dangerous they could add a CP on a cave which would be highly contested in this scenario. I know it wont happen but its a really nice map for levolution.And Mon Cala please include Mon Cala.,TheCloneWars,chada8f,2,t5_2vt4o

1088156,0,t3_24qqyv,I just realized that TFU cant be canon because Anakin brought balance to the force by killing jedi and becoming Sith leaving him and Sidious as well as Yoda and Obi. If Shaak Ti was still alive then there would not be balance. ,TheCloneWars,chrz5fj,0,t5_2vt4o
1167405,0,t1_ci0xfey,Yes! Of course. Cad Bane. Thats who I forgot.An arc that explores where Ahsoka went is all I want. I will be distraught if nothing is released about her in the next  years. Ill write something myself haha. More clone arcs too. I really enjoyed those and dee bradley bakers a great actor for individualizing all those clones. Plus maybe wed see Rexs fate. And Id sincerely hope NO MORE DROID stories!!!,TheCloneWars,ci0ybon,3,t5_2vt4o

1742560,0,t1_cjymmxh,I completely understand and reluctantly agree with your position to exclude the episodes despite their quality.I feel similarly about Episode I and when Im introducing new people to Star Wars I eliminate EpI from the viewing order and add it later as supplemental material.  Too often people think that its because it sucks but its not.  EpI does really good worldbuilding but the story it tells isnt important to the overall Skywalker fatherson story.,TheCloneWars,cjyt8q2,2,t5_2vt4o

2543814,0,t1_cmq9rvj,season  is just tripy and most of the series isnt considered cannon anymore. I wouldnt say he was full blown dark side but he was def starting to mistrust the order. Losing ashoka thanks to the jedi further pushed him from the order. I feel like it shouldve done the same with sidious seeing as how he was speeding the trial up and not listening to anything said about the trial. ,TheCloneWars,cmqm3mh,0,t5_2vt4o

3404358,0,t1_cpfwkb5,After youve seen five seasons of TCW and Ahsokas growth within the story youll have a better understanding of how and why Anakin fell. I think youll also find the series strengthens the idea that the rise of the Empire was only possible due to the sheer arrogance and incompetence of the Jedi Order. ,TheCloneWars,cpgbm24,1,t5_2vt4o

3832348,0,t3_34at8r,That was awesome. Those guys really reminded me of Republic Commandos.Arc spoilerss My heart dropped when they first showed Echo when he was plugged in. Thats messed up. Super glad hes alive though. He probably still thinks Fives is alive.  I noticed Mace called him Corporal and not ARC Trooper. I guess hes no longer considered an ARC Trooper? Or maybe hes both a Corporal and an ARC. Maybe ARCs are Corporals? Not sure honestly.Also... more spoilerss Anakin killed Admiral Trench! That whole sequence of events was awesome. I bet Yularen will be happy to hear that. Ill miss Trench he was one of the only competent Separatist leaders and one I loved to hate.,TheCloneWars,cqt4cpv,3,t5_2vt4o

5629590,0,t1_cwuvr3y,yeah I already know that im just confused as to how its possible SE is before uncle ono died because its a direct continuation of SE which showed Ahsoka more mature and in different clothes.

9446320,0,t3_5a29iv,I honestly cant bring myself to watch that arc anymore. It gives me incredible anxiety. And thats weird because its one of my favorite arcs such a great story. Not to mention how visually beautiful it was. I hate the guy as much as you. The part where the clones where shooting each other really breaks my heart. With TCW you really grow to love these guys. I dunno I just hate seeing them lose. I really loved the fact that this arc addressed the whole but I was only following orders!!. And what I mean by that is that the clones were faced with moral dilemmas. They did what they felt was right despite the fact that their commanding officer was doing everything is his power to makes their lives difficult.Also I found Krell to be pretty terrifying honestly. Hes a big skilled jedi with four arms and two double bladed light sabers. Goodness. They way he addressed the Clones by their original designation and not by their humanized names was cruel in my opinion. What I absolutely loved about this entire series is how humanized the Clones were. So seeing him blatantly disrespect the Clones like that pissed me off. Theyre people christ. ,TheCloneWars,d9ddyyr,10,t5_2vt4o

10316305,0,t1_dc7a6la,Seems like a bit of a stretch. All of the dialogue suggests that they are in fact highly capable.Palpatine engineered the war to induce the senate to give him emergency powers no? Draining the republics resources wouldnt have been in his interest. Not to mention he would then need the clones in order to retain his handle on power.
