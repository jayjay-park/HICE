My first reaction to this one was yeah sure I dont want higher taxes. But then I thought why does this need to be an amendment to the constitution? What if the state has a lot of growth and we need more money for infrastructure or education or something so I changed my first impulse and voted NO. Now I see this article and Im glad I did. We need SOMETHING with EXACTLY WHATS ON THE BALLOT a week or two before we vote. I feel like I was being tricked into voting yes for something.
