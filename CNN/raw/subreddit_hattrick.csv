2190668,0,t3_2k4x19,Im convinced that the best way to train now is players not skills. In other words you cant get very far training playmaking every week for seasons. You need to pick some star players and train them in whatever they need while bringing the other players on your team along for the ride.,hattrick,cliaczi,2,t5_2sizd

Although  million dollars does seem excessive however its been  seasons since i did my last upgrade which i cant remember the exact cost of but it was a lot  more then that. Really as long as your fiances are sound its not a bad investment and you should be getting more income from your stadium.    ,hattrick,d8pxfey,2,t5_2sizd
