5552741,0,t3_3r2nl5,Updates! Updates! Updates!A good nights sleep and some dinking around and it turns out that it was my fault that the upper part of the XP elevator was failing. So with that error repaired the Gold Farm was functionally complete.Still being us uCheesius and I had to keep fixing things up.Completed Tasks Repaired XP Elevator  you can now idle at the top and xp orbs will be bounced up to you. Filled in corners of the glass tube that was allowing some mob drops to escape. switched out the glass on the chicken coop so it all matches. Added hoppers to collect the few items that ended up in the  block space at the XP elevator boost. Added filters to sift out and discard any raw chickens feathers or eggs that make it into the grinder at the bottom. Added buttontriggered sword flush so that the sword chests can be dumped out when theres nothing worth keeping in them. Added Garbage Chest in the sorting room that will dispense anything placed in it onto a cactus useful if youve got a full inventory and need space to bring some gold home or whatever. Split the ladder into segments so you cant miss the floor you meant to stop on anymore. Added speakeasy style hatch to pull out any remaining XP at the killing level so you can grab the last little bits on your way down from the farm. But be warned its not perfect at containing the XP if youre hanging out down there with the hatch closed. removed all dirt scaffolding made a serious attempt at removing all spawnable spaces. enclosed the Killing level lounge area. Cheesius allso wrote a new instructions book.Remaining stuff Maybe neaten up the idling area make the enchanting setup a bit roomier add some chests for storingsorting enchanted books etc. otherwise.. nothing.. its basically done fixed and working at an amazing clip.,Mountaineercraft,cwld9gz,1,t5_2yujb
