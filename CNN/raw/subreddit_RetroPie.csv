3449137,0,t1_cpgpq5h,Hey just in case you still havent fixed that problem I just experienced the same thing and found the solution. I put Roms in the n folder instead of the one that was something like nmupenplus and that got the n to SHOW UP in emulation station. From there I selected a game and immediately held down the x key which launched the emulator settings. From there I changed the default emulator to mupenplus from the default. The menu also lets you access other settings even to set defaults for specific roms. Everything worked perfectly for me after that just with some occasional settings tweaking. I wish someone had told me about the whole hold down x trick before I spent hours and hours screwing with the individual files. I never bothered to read the text when the game loads so its really my fault but it wouldve been nice to know...,RetroPie,cplff2m,2,t5_31mi1

That file wont be automatically refreshed unless you remap your buttons in emulation station again or configure your controller using the RetroPieSetup script Im unsure if jstest resets this file as well.      inputresetbtn  This is also true with any other button mappings you dont want in your controller config file  the variables are not organized so youll have to sort through them.For axes use I believe you would require analogs like those found on a PS controller etc. Here are my button mapping for a PS controller this is set in the global retroarch file so I dont have to edit each retroarch emulator I use    cd optretropieconfigsall    sudo nano retroarch.cfgInside the file I have the following lines for the axes     Two analog sticks DualShockesque.     Bound as usual however if a real anolog axis is bound     it can be read as a true analog     Positive X axis is right Positive Y axis is down.    inputplayerlxplus  Axis     inputplayerlxminus  Axis     inputplayerlyplus  Axis     inputplayerlyminus  Axis     inputplayerrxplus  Axis     inputplayerrxminus  Axis     inputplayerryplus  Axis     inputplayerryminus  Axis Heres the code for using the left anolog as a DPad     Axis for RetroArch DPad.      Needs to be either  or  in the first character signaling either positive or negative direction of the axis then the axis number.      Do note that every other input option has the corresponding btn and axis binds as well they are omitted here for clarity    inputplayerupaxis      inputplayerdownaxis      inputplayerleftaxis      inputplayerrightaxis  For the PS anologs to work the anolog button must be pressed and lit especially inside EmulationStation you wont be able to navigate emulators. For emulators like MAMEALL and FBA you can switch between anolog ONOFF to switch between using the left analog as the DPad or the directional buttons as the DPad.

Im powering the Pi with a samsung cell phone charger cord and charger brick and it seems stable running everything else even playing Quake  with max number of bots.

5637258,0,t1_cw9nq6k,In a nutshell because emulator authors are working almost completely blind trying to reverse engineer a piece of physical hardware with little or no documentation as to how that hardware originally was supposed to work since all of that information is usually still a tightly guarded secret despite these products being off the market for decades.Also you have to deal with the inefficiency of software doing something that was done previously in hardware.  Heres a rough analogyThis is entirely made up Im just trying to explain the concept  emulator authors do not flame me because this is not actually trueLets say that the processor in a system such as the N or the SNES is really good at for example multiplication.  Imagine for a second that its particular CPU could multiply any two numbers between  and  billion together in a single operation.Lets say that this particular systems processor ran at mhz  thats roughly  operations per second.  Assuming for this exercise that there is NO overhead that particular CPU can do  million multiplication operations every second.  Now imagine that your particular game is nothing but multiplication operations.That means that every second your emulator has to perform those same  million multiplication operations AND has to then retranslate the result for its own purposes.  Now imagine that due to architectural shifts in the computing world it takes your particular CPU  operations to multiple  numbers together because your CPU is optimized differently  just go with me on this.As a result it now takes you  operations or roughly mhz to do what used to take you th as much timeresourcesetc.So now youre doing things literally  times less fast than the original system did them.And again this is all in a complete vacuum  assuming no overhead and assuming youre able to do these operations perfectly in the exact manner the original system did them without needing to add additional code to check for certain special conditions that the original hardware ignored.Heres another example from the realm of video processing.  In the video processing world the value of a color might be between  and  with  being black and  being white.  When doing video operations you might have two whites being added together and this will get you a value of .The video processor on a system like the SNES might see any value above  and clamp that value so that it cant go above .  As a result of this the gamessystems code never needed to account for this scenario since any attempt to go above  was just dumped back to  because the video processor only had  bits to work with so it wasnt an issue.Fast forward to today when your video processor now has  bits.  Suddenly  doesnt equal white anymore and translating this to and from the original values means doing math in the interim.  Plus your new hardware doesnt clamp and instead interprets values above max to be something entirely different transparency? bump mapping? whatever.So now you have to understand how the original system worked which is often guesswork since the technical documents for the SNES are under lock and key at Nintendo HQ AND you have to do a whole bunch of math to basically undo  years of hardware progress that have occurred since the days of the SNES.So theres my overlong explanation. Hope this helps.,RetroPie,cwvut6n,3,t5_31mi1

Always go to the manufacturers website usually their support page find your gear and download the latest ones.On one hand that ensures youve got the most up to date most secure stuff. On the other hand you now dont have to wait for it to download those updates anyhow which may or may not break the functionality of something else.For Linux drivers especially they dont always come on those CDs anyhow.If you cant find something from the manufacturer google the exact model number and name of the device you have  chances are youll find someone knowledgeable whos already gone through that process and has found either the correct drivers or rd party ones that work instead.,RetroPie,cyzg3ga,6,t5_31mi1

NES Gameboy Mega Drive PC Engine all good.Most SNES games will work alright but some complex games will run slow Ive seen people say games with Mode  like Mario Kart run slow. Gameboy Advance is probably about the same?PlayStation will be really pushing it some games will run well at lower resolutions. Forget N Saturn Dreamcast PSP and anything like that.For arcade MAMEFBA games it really depends what game and what emulator you use. Any D games like Cruisin USA or Tekken wont run well on any Pi. D games like Street Fighter II or really old stuff like Tapper and Pac Man should run ok.Outrun runs smoothly in mameall old but not smoothly in mame newer so later emulator doesnt always mean better gameplay and vice versa. You just have to test.There are compatibility lists on the Wiki though last I checked they didnt have muchany Zerospecific info.Edit Talking to people on IRC the Zero has the same singlecore CPU as a Pi  just a little faster.

I guess there will be some interaction with parentchild process relationships which makes this not work.A better way might be to make a systemd target which stops lightdm and starts ES.

Obviously if the controller is connecting directly through the USB then you do not need a bluetooth connection to be configured but you may still need to edit some config files for EmulationStation to properly see the controller.  I do not have any real experience messing with the nonbluetooth udev rules or with manually adding drivers so I cant be very helpful with this.

9919854,0,t1_db0kf8w,gtAfter doing some googling it seems like a lot of people end up using an Arduino Leonardo or Teensy as a USB controller board seems like its the easier method as theres more documentation. Its not that its easier its mostly because its a better solution. A raspberry pi doesnt have dedicated hardware for reading inputs  if its going to check if a button is pressed it had to use computing time when another process isnt using it. For a MHz Arduino if checking a button takes  cycles you can do it a million times a second. The arduino doesnt have to check its own RAM or HDD or wifi or games or anything else. Its completely dedicated. Then you can just pass on information to the pi when a button changes. And the reason an Arduino Leonardo is used is that it can spoof a keyboard or mousr these are called HID devices. So you can make it send an A when a arcade button is pressed or make the computer thing a mouse is moving when your joystick is being jostled around. All pretty easy to code too! ,RetroPie,db0kytd,1,t5_31mi1

It would have taken you a lot less time than making a post. Took me all of about  seconds to type that into a google search box and get the results. Half the fun is learning how to do it. When you venture into a hobby you need to learn how to do things. You wouldnt work on your car without knowing how to put it back together would you? If I decided to restore an old motorcycle I would start by reading what there is to it and how to do it BEFORE I even bought my first motorcycle. I would want to know what I am getting into beforehand. This is no different. It is a hobby. As such I read about basic information regarding that hobby. Learning how to manipulate google to find what I am looking for. I knew exactly nothing about RetroPie two weeks ago. If you would have to even bothered to google retropie you could have read a nice short primer about the basic operations of it. You would have learned how to add roms to your setup. Your post comes across as I was given this all done for me I dont want to do anything to learn about it just tell me how to do it. Kids and a job doesnt matter. In fact when my daughter was a baby I learned to how to make the most of my time by reading about my hobbies. When I got a chance to do them I used what I learned from reading to enhance my experience. I learned what phrases to use to get better search results. But alas you even said it I dont want to learn and take my time I just want the payoff right now and later I might learn how to do it so dont try to make me see that I should learn the basics today.,RetroPie,df0c0fu,1,t5_31mi1

It gets into the selection of using different premade retro gaming OSs which you can probably skip if youre already decided on one.

I made it so that I can have additional cheat buttons for things like special moves in Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.

11477126,0,t1_dfwwaq7,Hmmm. Doesnt really say much. You should enable debug logging in Kodi then play something and wait for it to happen again. This will give a much more complete event log. Please dont post it here. Put it on pastebin or similar site and post a link. ,RetroPie,dfwxf54,1,t5_31mi1

11614489,0,t3_65mrpv,As mentioned drop the Pi to a Linux shell and you can do almost anything. External CD drives are pretty boring and its likely that Raspbian the Linux OS running would support it just fine.ghrayfahx has a good point about loading the disc in the emulator but maybe you could use the actual RetroArch menu press Hotkey  A while in game and the Load Content option pretty sure thats the name to load the disc after you are already in the emulator. That wouldnt work from the frontend without some tweaking to the emulator launch scripts but hey the potential is there.,RetroPie,dgciges,1,t5_31mi1

11720840,0,t3_675nrm,Funny I spent half of yesterday tackling this! Had issues where the USB wouldnt auto mount in Kodi. Looked through various resources for a while but wasnt too keen on having to know the UUID of every device if I messed with fstab. If I had it plugged in at boot Id get a FAILED error on boot with the usbromservice that retropie provides. I ended up uninstalling usbromservice in the retropie setup then modifying the automount program that was already in the raspbian lite setup I have. I looked into pmount also. Check out this link I just added the FSMOUNTOPTIONS that were included in the comment just to test and Kodi auto recognized the mount point mediausb without issue. Since Im not using USB for rom transfers anymore I figured why not? Did make a backup right before just in case but so far so good. Its something I wont use a lot but Ive got a friend who will and I wanted an easy way to mount the drive without him having to go to command line  sudo mount devsda mnt just to mount the drive. Kodi would recognize the drive if I mounted it to mnt or mediausb or any sub number  etc,RetroPie,dgol4kx,1,t5_31mi1
