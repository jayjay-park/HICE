9952699,0,t3_5i25lx,Hey SkyNo need to dwell on specifics just wanted to send the love and respect you deserve.  Divulging those thoughts that were eating at you for all to see is certainly not easy but I hope it helps relieve some stress for you in the long term.  Further I hope the community at large not this subreddit but the larger socialverse P can better understand you as a person not just a content creator.  Mad respect for all you do youve provided some of my best laughs and entertainment on YouTube and youre a unique and awesome guy.  Its generic AF for me to say this but if you ever need anything dont hesitate to PM and chat.  Kind regardsKiJoBu ,SkyWilliams,db4v1ry,1,t5_30tlg
9965858,0,t1_db67x2w,I guess all I can do is wait to see what this does to my content.im not gonna lie  I had a old video ready but... I Just cant bring myself to release it.,SkyWilliams,db6kslz,1,t5_30tlg

10185702,0,t1_dbyl1r7,Then you are fighting a battle that by our very nature as human being simply cannot be won. If it was something like having slaves is bad or dont sacrifice virgins to Zeus then I would agree with you. But trying to get people to not be shitty to each other simply can not be done. People are have always been and will always be assholes to each other. And getting worked up over other peoples shittyness only serves to make your life miserable.,SkyWilliams,dbylt80,2,t5_30tlg
10517947,0,t3_5qlzgk,just do both I guess. if you really feel like the effort one is not worth the money you can always just take a different sponsorship for another video so dont sweat it,SkyWilliams,dd0bmql,1,t5_30tlg

11500099,0,t3_6459np,First and foremost I hope ur past the whole Im carried by dunkey phase. I literally got into ur videos seeing fight or give up on my suggestions and recognized u from Top  Genesis  commentating and have loved ur videos ever since. nd of all the clouds were a good idea. U were being honest with us telling us what content had a bunch of effort and what didnt. Whether u pump bad videos or not what matters is the good videos u do make are as legendary as they have been these past monthsrd of all. Ur game was stepping up imo. Ever since the clouds came whenever u marked a legendary video it always impressed me. ESPEACIALLY the John Tron reaction.th and finally I get why people dislike the Zoe video but I enjoyed it. Sky clearly youre into offensive comedy but you also dont want to offend ur fans so its a hard mix. I think u need to pick which side u want to lean more on and let ur fans get used to that. Like youve stated in older videos ur trying to appeal to us all. Which means ur drawing in one crowd but then by trying to appeal to the other crowd u may disinterest ur old crowd. But then by redrawing ur old crowd and possibly what u really find is funny the new crowd is now angry at u.I think ur really diverse with ur comedy and I love it but I think others want what they want. I dont have the answers but Ill support your content as long as ur not doing anything as amoral as kidnap or murder. I hope you get through what u do and Im gonna be there hoping for your successP.s. I swear Im not lying your vids got me into dunkey. Im not big on YT or league and Everytime u do a league video I dont have a clue whats going on lol but you featuring him on vids and the dunkey beat sky meme made me look him up.,SkyWilliams,dfzjb31,3,t5_30tlg
