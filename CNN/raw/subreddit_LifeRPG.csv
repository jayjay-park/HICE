Youre obviously doing more advanced work with the piano rather than with your drawing so set Play the piano to a higher difficulty so it will level up at a faster rate.  Alternatively you could create a fake difficult piano task to artificially bring up your level. I would advise against this but only because it would personally decrease ambition. ,LifeRPG,dc9okv5,3,t5_2v296
10306686,0,t3_5mys20,I look at the completion of the parent mission as the reward for completing a larger and more complex mission. As MisterPionier said washing the dishes and wiping them down. You could wash the dishes and get the reward however if you wash and dry them you get the bonus reward for completing the whole mission. Thats how I break down complex missions and earn greater reward for completing them.,LifeRPG,dccbgse,2,t5_2v296
