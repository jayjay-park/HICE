5971857,0,t3_3x6jgb,FQC gt Eye every time for now. Supposedly theyre talking about tacking  cdr onto the eye items and after they do it might be a bit more viable on targons supports maybe even some blue gp supports or yellow gp that build RG  but the active extra gold and the on hit effect on FQC are far more valuable than the slot efficiency which wont really even come into play until you hit full build. and Full build isnt very common on a support especially considering how fast games are ending now. ,NamiMains,cy2fwji,1,t5_387du

6978891,0,t3_4b9f0j,Soraka will keep you alive.  Nami will poke the shit out of the enemy lane while providing heals.    I dont play much Soraka but thats generally the difference between the two. ,NamiMains,d17e96w,2,t5_387du

8253364,0,t1_d596uw2,What i hate the most is Zyra. even more if there is paired with an Poke or Slow adc Ezreal  Ashe mostlyAgainst Jhin  Most common tip i can give to you is dont hesistate to throw the tidal weave to interrupt curtain call. Against thresh Playmaking willing to go in you can play passive and throw bubbles anytime they try to engage to shut down the play. Or play agro try to poke they down and if they engage on you try to tanksustain while your ADC have free time killing them. probably you need to feel how much dmg they do and how fast your ADC can kill themOther than that avoid  shot  try to control the bush  dance your tail arround Jhin W. And if thresh hits hook the ideal point is before he pullts himself in your bubble should be already in the air towards enemy ADC. Anytime this happens is free trade for you.,NamiMains,d5985uq,1,t5_387du

9328222,0,t3_581y9m,Veterans Scars is always better.  Since you generally play aggressively with Nami in lane the extra HP is always helpful.  Stack some HP runes on top of it and youll be golden ,NamiMains,d8yf56g,3,t5_387du

9776599,0,t3_5f80bl,No for several reasons.Rod of Ages costs  gold which is a lot of gold to be saving up for a support. That means youll be getting it very late especially if its your third item and wont fully charge up until maybe the  to  minute mark or even later. Also prioritizing it right after vision and boots means you miss out on your gold item upgrade as well as active support items.Also the reasons you are buying this item are not worth it. Mana shouldnt be an issue because a large amount of support items you would get anyway give you mana regen. Same with health there are enough support items out there to make you more durable. That said Nami is a squishy support so you shouldnt really be looking to take large amounts of damage in the first place.The AP is essentially useless on Nami. the  AP will give you  more points of healing whereas a single Forbidden Idol gives you . extra healing at level  W just from the passive.Also the one stat RoA is not giving you is CDR which you really want on Nami. It means more heals more CC more passive application.The biggest issue however is opportunity cost. Buying RoA means you are not buying things like Redemption Locket Mikaels or TalismanFrost Queens. Each of those essentially give you more skills more tools to expand your utility. And since the support is pretty much the only one buying such items you not buying them means your team wont have access to these tools.,NamiMains,dai6jq9,5,t5_387du

10184518,0,t3_5lq4do,I havent played as much ranked as I like this season so far but Im having a easy time with Nami in FlexQ and Im playing solo. Even won a v . I would need to play more SoloQ but so far it feels rough to me. Either way Nami is in a real good spot. Redemption has been a huge buff to her. ,NamiMains,dbygzeg,1,t5_387du
