7364095,0,t3_4g7stv,Hey GuysI made a playthrough of a new free game on steam that is a sound puzzle game with a similar art style to Limbo. It is very abstract and doesnt explain itself explicitly so you are able to make your own mind about what is happening and even what happened.Episode Hope you like itFish,GetMoreViewsYT,d2f8wjp,1,t5_37nzq

You have more of an audience looking for that game that not every Youtuber is doing already. The only lets player I watch at all does RP games and talks about what his character would do and plays older games that people arent doing videos for so much.  ,GetMoreViewsYT,d3oj7s2,2,t5_37nzq
