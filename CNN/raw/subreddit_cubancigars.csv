8865972,0,t3_51m7ha,These were cigars made in a different era. At the time there was a significant competition between Davidoff and Dunhill. These two previously controlled the trade of cigars from Cuba. After the Cuban Revolution many Cuban cigar houses fled to neighboring countries and the brands began to be sold directly. In response Davidoff started their own brand of cigars in the late s. Dunhill came a bit later to the market with their own branded cigars mostly importing a Dunhill selection of other makers cigars before that. These two giants were aiming for the same space which at the time the s was all about refinement and complexity in cigar blends.Ten years after they both stopped in  the cigar boom was on the upswing. Since then the goals of cigar blends and how they are marketed has changed dramatically.While Dunhill Cuban cigars were quite good I expect youll be disappointed by them. If youve come up on todays cigars you will perceive a watered down rather anemic strong cigar profile which will simply puzzle and disappoint you. In addition these cigars are well into the final aging process so if you are not a connoisseur of aged preembargo Cuban cigars already the sweetly dusty profile may be unpleasant to you and not at all what you expect its really a waste.,cubancigars,d7dkd5b,4,t5_2ud4e
9237373,0,t3_56unzy,Short answer is yes they are cheaper over there than here. You can bring  per person without paying duties. In Havana there a few shops you can find that sell at a fair price some shops will charge slightly more but I find duty free shops at the airport on your way back have the best prices. Keep in mind selection on the other hand at the duty free is not that great. Add Partagas factory in central Old Havana behind Capitolio if thats the right spelling to your list of shops to visit and buy only in store do not buy from the people around the building you will not get the real stuff no matter what they say.,cubancigars,d8mwl4o,1,t5_2ud4e
