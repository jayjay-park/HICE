6769011,0,t3_48fqzh,Hi! Bad Nidalee here! While these arent going to be the case all the time here are some goals I shoot for.What is an expectedgood time to get to level ? On a good game .minutes.What is an expectedgood time to get to Runic Echoes completed? Around level What is an expected CSmin in the early game? You should never have a camp up for more than s. All camps should be kept cleared. Also any time an opponent is not in their lane and you are then push that wave to tower.What is an expected CSmin in the overall game? Same as above.What is an expected time to get RoA completed? You shouldnt be building it every game but  minutes is standard.,NidaleeMains,d0jjqjx,2,t5_38aml
6862619,0,t1_d0tcehr, Nidalee    Prowl Passive  Bushwack W will once again root monsters for  seconds.  Javelin Toss Q still does not root monsters. Tooltip hasnt been updated        NOTE On live Q and W will root monsters. In  PBE was changed so they no longer root. Todays update is a partial revert so only W roots.    Aspect of the Cougar R no longer resets AA. This was originally implemented in  update.,NidaleeMains,d0u6rsl,1,t5_38aml

8910277,0,t3_5294ye,Nidalee mid isnt very good because her build paths can get kind of awkward in mid and her waveclear and ability to push and then roam to a side lane which is what the best mid laners do is pretty trash. Maybe you can make her work top into very specific easy matchups as ap but other than that just keep her to the jungle and just learn how to jungle if you want to play nidalee that badly.,NidaleeMains,d7ivvtt,1,t5_38aml

9187234,0,t3_55y89d,AD is no longer worth it because of the auto reset removal. The auto reset also made attack speed useless because well youd get a lot more auto attacks in regardless of your attack speed. But now theres no auto attack reset so for general AA damage you still rely on attack speed.I still dont really like it but each to their own i guess. ,NidaleeMains,d8gjrt3,1,t5_38aml

10953028,0,t3_5wdm17,For Midlane I enjoy playing a more lategame centred build basically trying to be relevant.This build allows your spears to actually properly hurt not like the old days but you still get WTFs in all chatTearMorello component Cdr in easier lanes Mana regen one in tougher lanes  Morello Completion  Boots  Seraphs usually with perfect timing  VoidRabadons Depending on whether you need more heals or damage Lich BaneThe problem is honestly the fact that you get Lich very late the synergy between seraphmorello and sheen mana is great.Due to the lack of sustain im the game this is actually fairly decent if you get through the  minute weakness that you get.However EoN meta ruins it atm.Lategame you play secondary support healing your Ad trapping trying to spear squishies and burst whatever comes to kill your AD coigar Q damage is ridiculous even vs tanks but youre forced into a very careful playstyle late.,NidaleeMains,de9q6l4,3,t5_38aml
10968378,0,t3_5wgb30,Look at what HP shaco has vs what you have  times you have your first buff already if shaco is level  there is  things he could have went Q and W he needs W for clear and Q for invading this leaves him very vulnerable to any real dueling so if you go W after Q youll always have the advantage keep in mind they also nerfed his Q to only last . seconds at lvl  this gives you a massive chance to chase him as your passive allows you to easily catch up to anyone without boots.Or he could have gone W into E in which case he has no real escape so keep dancing with him until you get him low enough he has no real way of ever getting to youUsually I just powerclear first  camps for lvl  then ward red and continue my clear if its still there if its gone I walk to his jungle and take whatever camps he has left there or if I manage to find him Ill fight him. shacos are always really cocky so they underestimate the damageHope this helps!,NidaleeMains,debb6ym,1,t5_38aml
