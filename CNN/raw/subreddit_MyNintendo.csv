7096303,0,t3_4cr9md,from my understanding its per purchase you buy a game its . you get  gold coins.Based on the above statement I have done some math and if you have the choice of buying a games for exactly  or exactly  its your best option for buying gold coins at  cents per coin.When I get off work ill compare to actual game prices on the eshop to see what games are the best gold coin deals.,MyNintendo,d1kqi43,6,t5_3ajs7

7282184,0,t3_4f4r6v,I went with Wario Ware. Its quirky. One item to note though is since it is a DS game the game is stored on the systems memory not your SD card so you may have to do some managing of space in order to load the game. I had to delete Four Sword and Mario Minis DS games to fit it on.,MyNintendo,d25xpgx,1,t5_3ajs7
