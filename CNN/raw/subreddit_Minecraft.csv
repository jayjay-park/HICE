84207,0,t3_1v2blg,Explanation The portals are actually villagers in spawner minecarts. To find out how the minecart spawner portals are spawned see this comment on my blockgun post. Once both portals have been placed there is not much actual redstone. The spawner carts give you buttons wooden from the blue stone from the red when you get close enough and when you have the th inventory slot selected it attempts to clear both wooden and stone buttons from your inventory. Depending on which button it is able to clear it teleports you to the villager that has the name that is not the portal you were at. Not seen in the .gif gfycat  second limit is the sword functionality. It deletes the portals when held. I dont know if this works in multiplayer. The invisible villagers have an unusable trade you cannot trade with them. World download.,Minecraft,ceo0ksv,2,t5_2r05i

Thanks for this post!Possibly not helpful but maybe so contribution hovering over spots in a crafting table and pressing  puts the whole stack of whatever is in that position in the hotbar in that spot on the table. Good for mass crafting sometimes.For example recently I was massconverting redstone dust to blocks for storage and it was easier to fill my inventory with single redstone blocks to take up space and give a place for crafted blocks to go and leave my hotbar empty then break chests and craft with the hotkeys without having to leave the crafting menu because Id keep picking up redstone dust from the ground.

132705,0,t3_1viupt,As a primarily modded player this thread is amazing! I too love even vanilla automation. When using mods  I really love things that streamline the vanilla mechanics without being a total makeover. I love vanilla Redstone but I barely understand it. It has been disappointing to view snapshot vids and makes me want to just lean  on the mods. Making automatic farms and systems is just as cool as making towers or railways. I think its a great disservice to the entire Minecraft community to destroy such a widely used andor admired aspect of the game. Making it more challenging is fine but to tune the game just to destroy established systems seems kinda mean if Im honest. ,Minecraft,cetjmd9,1,t5_2r05i

145881,0,t1_cev0uup,Youre thinking of automatic farms as things that dont take any effort. Look into how much effort it takes to make an iron farm. Even the simplest ones which produce maybe  ironhour are pretty labor intensive especially if you dont spawn near a village or cant even find a village and need to to purify zombies to get villagers. The higher end ones like the iron foundry take massive amounts of effort and usually multiple tries to get working properly.Thats the feeling of accomplishment building something really complicated that lets you overcome limitations.,Minecraft,cev1p6r,0,t5_2r05i

148014,0,t3_1vqrno,Well I am an avid fan of the automation in Minecraft but i never use the iron i obtain from farms for things such as trading or tools. I mainly using it for crafting iron blocks for building with as collecting such a huge amount of iron is very difficult. All i would like to say is that i find it fine that there is a small aspect of automation in the game i just believe that people should not exploit this to their hearts content. It will not only help them but will also take the fun out of the game. Even though building the farms may be nice after a certain point you will not have much to do as most of the stuff you need will be collected automatically. All i am trying to say is that farming in moderation is fun as heck but if all you do is farm and then exploit the items you get you wont have any fun at all.,Minecraft,cevafuc,1,t5_2r05i

LynchyInc AurelienSama Whomever did that awesome sky whale build  months ago I cant find the post  and ulentebriesjes Sango Sho to name a few.

The server had a shop there blaze powder sold for about  times more than Blake rods. Using this we got the most powerful armour and it was fully enchanted. We invited players to our obsidian base at bedrock. About  of these people were okay the other used set home to repeatedly spawn there and attack us. Despite our armour he managed to kill us after about  mins. He took our base so we moved away but kept our faction home there. When he left we teleported in found out stuff and flooded the base with lava. When he rejoined he claimed we hacked it. The admin removed all our inventories and destroyed all our chests. One of the mods felt sorry for us and hidden a double chest filled with the good golden apples. Once we sold these we had the most money on the game more than the admin...

First thing Ive built was a small brick house with an iron door didnt know you needed a lever so I had to break it to get in and chests inside. Next build was a brick apartment building with my real name on top. There was a pool next to it. I thought when it rained it would fill.Other old stuff I remember building was a hockey stadium black skyscraper clock tower wood library golden water slide dance club embedded into a mountain Italian restaurant and a farm with cows and a barn connected to a McDonalds.

463170,0,t1_cfsqde2,gtAll I can do is repeat myself until you see what I mean.You arent repeating your original position you are changing your stance and refusing to acknowledge you were wrong.gtGriefing in the sense of bullying should be against the TOS but If a server allows griefing its not griefing.If the server DOESNT allow it it is against the servers rules. Why are you so set on putting this at a game wide TOS level? As if it would even do anything if it were.gtuPointsOutRaceCard is just an account posting comments attempting to correct people for karma he doesnt actually care about the situation.Nope!

468779,0,t3_1zgq28,there are varying degrees of gaming laptops.  If you realistically expect a helpful response write down the specs of your computer.  If you just want to vent thats understandable but please dont expect a reasonable response.That being said uBoxfigs is correct for such a simple game there are actually quite a few things going on in the background that can be quite intensive.Computer Hardware and its affect on MCBelow are a list of things that could affect performance in MC.  I dont have a comprehensive list of which component will affect which aspect of the game but this is based on my limited experience and knowledge.  Maybe uredstonehelper can shed some more light on this.  RAM  Random Access Memory.  The more of this the better.  If your gaming rig is any good itll have at least GB of RAM.  In my experience RAM will help out in cases where there are a lot of entities or mobs around and your computer has to analyze a lot of data because of it..  CPU Processor Speed  Unfortunately atthemoment having a core CPU is not going to help you that much over a core or even a dualcore CPU.  Vanilla Minecraft doesnt utilize multiple cores yet so there is not too much of a benefit in having the latestandgreatest.  That being said MC wont run all that well on an old Pentium III even the i processors arent the greatest with MC..  Video Card GPU  This is where most of the heavylifting is done in MC.  Every block that MC has to render up to  blocks away when you have far render distance on relies on the Video card to calculate lighting water dynamics graphics particles etc.  All of those nice little entities spinning on the ground will cost some GPU time.  You also want to make sure your graphics card drivers are uptodate dont use BETA drivers as they have known issues with MC.  EDIT  This is the area where most Laptops yes even gaming laptops have issues.  A lot of laptops have shared memory video cards where the video card uses RAM in order to temporarily boost its power.  These are always inefficient and arent really good for gaming or video editing..  Java Version Software Related  If you have a gaming laptop Im assuming youre running a bit Windows installation.  If thats the case you want to make sure you have bit Java installed.  This will ensure that Java is utilizing your processor in the most efficient way possible.  Fixes for low FPSIf you cant figure out whats causing low fps you can first try some ingame fixes.  .  Lower the render distance.  Most people dont realistically need to render  blocks in each direction.  Lowering the render distance will dramatically lower the amount of blocks you are rendering lowering MCs demand on your processor RAM and GPU..  Turning Particles to Minimal.  Lowering the particles will lessen the load MC puts on your processor and Video Card GPU.There is also Optifine which is a mod that affects the video rendering side of MC.Optifine    Optifine does a lot of things differently than vanilla MC.  It has gotten some flack with the latest update since it doesnt seem to help out gaming rigs as much as before but thats because the Devs at Mojang have actually utilized some of Optifines improvements as well as overhauled their rendering system.  You still might get better fps with Optifine but youll have a lot more settings to configure.,Minecraft,cftjvix,3,t5_2r05i

Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut or even gorged and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love.

When the ship is first wrecked youre drowning with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was and is no more.

Maybe its a person who is also floating. For a while all you can do is float. Stay alive.gtIn the beginning the waves are  feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come  seconds apart and dont even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while maybe weeks maybe months youll find the waves are still  feet tall but they come further apart. When they come they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between you can breathe you can function. You never know whats going to trigger the grief. It might be a song a picture a street intersection the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything... and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves there is life. Somewhere down the line and its different for everybody you find that the waves are only  feet tall. Or  feet tall. And while they still come they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary a birthday or Christmas or landing at OHare. You can see it coming for the most part and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you you know that somehow you will again come out the other side. Soaking wet sputtering still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage but youll come out.gtTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming and somehow you dont really want them to.

Then how could the one with  have them all?Because the rails stick to a block the bottom is not necessarily needed and thats why theres no zfighting in the example I mentioned at least if you only look at the rail.,Minecraft,cg0wduf,2,t5_2r05i

Using only named IDs no code will be modified. The game will still use numerical IDs internally but not in the code or save files. Used in this way the numbers can be adjusted without problems. If numeric IDs were used by the code or save files there would be problems such as ID conflicts.Also its much easier to remember named IDs that it is to remember arbitrarily assigned numbers.By the way the minecraft isnt required in most cases. When the Plugin API is finished I assume a prefix will be required if there is a plugin loaded.,Minecraft,cg4ak1m,1,t5_2r05i

628477,0,t3_21cfkg,So the base unit we have are  hoppers.  right above the next and none of them facing straight down. By not facing straight down they output sideways if able. The middle of the  is usually facing into the comparator which doesnt have an inventory slot so said hopper doesnt output.Hoppers will try to pull from the inventory above them including other hoppers. It will try this every hopper tick unless it is recieving power such as from a redstone torch like the last one is.The hopper on top is just moving items along the line. When the item in the top hopper matches the item in the middle hopper the only way it can fit in the hopper it moves to the middle hopper.The middle hopper is linked to a comparator which as you know outputs more strongly based on the number of items in the hopper.When the number of items in the middle hopper is large enough it can turn the torch on the bottom hopper off meaning the bottom hopper can suck items from above it. At the same time since it is not powered it can output items as well usually to a chest like Datales did in that video,Minecraft,cgbpj0t,2,t5_2r05i

762120,0,t1_cgqwl2r,Heres one that preserves the paragraphs protip if using the RES use the source button to copy commentsHi folks! There have been a number of changes made to the block model system over the past few weeks  mainly pertaining to textures  so I figured now would be as good a time as any to let you all know whats coming down the pipe. I figure you can start updating your resource packs before the first snapshot hits so that you can have updated packs available as soon as the relevant . snapshot becomes available rather than having a time when you cant use anything.One of the main things that has bugged me and Grum about the current block model system is that its still terribly reliant on code. For example in the currently released version of Minecraft the beacon model specifies a textureFacing of up in order to fetch the glass texture down to fetch the obsidian texture and north to fetch the beacon texture. This means that the model is still reliant on the values returned by code which makes the block model system ridiculously hardcoded and not a whole lot better than having the vertices themselves being specified by code. As a result Erik and I decided to revisit the system.Now rather than supplying a textureFacing parameter you simply specify a texture parameter. The texture specifier can be either direct or hierarchical. If its meant to be filled in by a child model it is prepended with the hash symbol . If its a direct texture reference its just the name of a file in assetsminecraftmodelstexturesblocks. Ill get to the exact usage later in this post.Other changes to the format involve how face culling is specified and how options for the model are specified. Heres a short list of the changes useAmbientOcclusion has been renamed to ambientocclusion for capitalization consistency. textureFacing has been deprecated in favor of texture a reference to the texture itself. cull has been renamed to cullface and specifies the opposite of which neighboring face causes culling to occur. For example if you have an eastfacing face but want it to be culled along a different axis lets say Z you would specify cullface north or cullface south. Element rotation has been made more verbose so that it is more clear that element rotation can only occur on a single axis. For example the rotation for one of the two faces of the cross model used by saplings and such is now  rotation  origin      axis y angle  rescale true  A new flag rescale has been added to the rotation parameters. The flag being set to true means that the face should be scaled along the nonrotation axes by the inverse size of the hypotenuse. In plain English a face covering  being rotated  degrees on the Y axis would have only ended up covering . to .. By setting rescale to true it will be rescaled to  to  once again.As an actual practical example lets look at Stone Brick. Previously all of the variants of Stone Brick just refer to the cube model since the texture is supplied by code. Now that its supplied by the model itself we need a unique model for each variant. Here is the model definition file in the latest codebase Going further up the chain lets have a look at stonebricknormal.json which defines the model for the uncracked unvined unchiseled version of stone brick You can see that the only unique thing about the model is its texture. The JSON definition indicates that the all texture reference should be filled in by stonebrick which refers to assetsminecrafttexturesblocksstonebrick.png. Moving one step further up the chain we have cubeall.json As you can see its just one more step of indirection. It uses the model specified by cube.json but rather than having individual textures perface all of the faces refer to one single reference called all. Last but not least lets take a look at cube.json itself Nothing special here other than the changes that Ive already mentioned earlier in the post.Last but not least lets move onto the subject of an entirely new feature for the block model system which I call UV Lock. Its specified as an additional parameter when defining the variant for a given model. As an example heres the definition file for quartz stairs uvlock is a parameter that directs the model system to recompute the UVs for a given model after rotation based on a shrinkwrap type of algorithm. I implemented it after I had the painful realization that I wouldnt be able to get pixelidentical results for things like fences using the new block model system. Fence for example has one single degree connection model that gets rotated by  degrees for the other three states. Theres one model that includes the northeast connections then its rotated into place for southeast southwest and northwest. However rotating the block preserves the UV coordinates that were originally specified. In some cases this can be desirable. In other cases though like fence you want lets say the contiguous horizontal bars of a given section to have a consistently repeating pattern. If you have different UVs thrown in due to the physical rotation then its going to look really weird and ugly. Therefore uvlock was devised. If you have an upper face that goes from  to  and its rotated by  degrees about the Y axis then rather than still being  it will now cover  as it should. Should is maybe a strong term to use here but its how it worked when everything was hardcoded and were trying to have as little visual impact from the block model system as possible.Anyway those are all of the upcoming changes to the block model system in a nutshell. There probably wont be a snapshot in this coming week due to the Easter holiday and the fact that Thursday is a halfday combined with us all leaving at  in the morning to go to the Blockholm exhibit at the Museum of Architecture in order to meetandgreet mark it on your calendars folks! so that means you have just over a week and a half in order to make updated versions of your models.Godspeed!,Minecraft,cgqwqks,25,t5_2r05i

When playing online it offers a lot of camouflage and protection.But it seems like I always start out just making a temporary cave in some hillside so I can store up resources before going exploring.  And then I want room for a garden. And then room for animals. And then an egg farm.  And then I have a bunch of XP built up so I wanna enchant stuff. But I need obsidian to do that so I burrow down and start branch mining for diamonds.  Then I have to then hunt down some damn obsidian.  When I finally get the enchantment table built I then realize I need leather for bookcases. So it takes me like a day to find goddamn cattle and then I have to expand my animal farm.  And it takes another few days to breed enough.After a few weeks my stupid ugly little temporary cave has exploded into a hideous unorganized massive underground base.

907982,0,t1_ch7fxxw,While it is a fantastic creation the description of it being a multi direction machine is a bit dubious as you have to break remove and place new blocks to get it to change directions. If we are allowed to disassemble the vehicle then I have no doubt a multi directional machine is possible. In fact you can already do it with a single linear engine. All you have to do is stop the machine and rotate all the blocks around the redstone block. Im talking about a machine you can ride in and updating a certain spot will turn it one way and updating another will turn it the other. On top of all of this look at the bulk of the machine you built. Now compound that bulk and realize that the more bulk is added the more bulk has to be able to be pulled in each direction in order to function. Im not trying to be a dick. Im just telling you the issues our group has run into over the last  hours. The  block limiting factor completely kills any chance of that type of machine being made.,Minecraft,ch7hrqz,1,t5_2r05i

1161412,0,t1_ci09b70,You know one of the things that made Minecraft so unique and so different from every other game was the fact that the COMMUNITY had the ability to take the game and made basically endless amounts of additions for it via plugins mods clients etc. Honestly if you think that the game would be as popular as it currently is without all the YouTube Mod and Plugin support it has received over the past few years than you are crazy. Sure there are no factual stats logging how much traffic Minecraft has gained from servers videos and whatever but I think we can all safely say that it has definitely been quite a bit. When it comes to servers specifically unlike a mod which can be developed and then updated throughout time the developer does not have to really pay anything into that mod aside from time correct me if I am wrong as I am not in the mod world and then yes people can donate to the mod developer. But servers specifically they have to pay hosting bills and much more to keep servers online and protected from DDoS attacks. Along with that some major networks spend a ridiculous amount of hours developing fun experiences for players. The time that these developers put into the plugins and maintenance for servers is more than once could do while juggling a full time job. What made minecraft unique is that servers could develop things to sell in game. When I say that I dont mean they can sell a diamond sword I mean they can develop their own ranking system and sell a rank. They can develop a game and have private access servers. That money yes it goes into keeping the server alive and also goes to cover the costs of living for those who actually develop full time for Minecraft now. If Mojang wants to enforce servers from selling literal parts of the game then fine go ahead and do that. However if they want to regulate all selling on servers than the innovation and creativity that has been put into making these things will die down as these people have to focus on other tasks. As much as we would all love to believe that servers can run on the sole fact that people MAY donate because they love the server you have to understand the target audience is kids they dont really understand what a server costs and how much a sale on a server really helps. A lot of servers NEED sales to keep running and developing. I would have never touched minecraft after  months if servers and mods didnt exist. Thats what keeps the game interesting for me. ,Minecraft,ci09zta,23,t5_2r05i

Sure you can buy a server for the cost of a few months hosting but where are you going to put it that can match the connection speed and hardware reliability of a good host?If you want to even come close to that youd need to have at least one spare servers worth of parts lying around in order to maintain a viable backup plan in the case of downtime.  So double whatever cost youre thinking of.  Then you need to have someone available to make any replacements  hours a day.  There are costs associated with that  whether by paying someone or by losing out on other opportunities by spending your own time to do it.The type of serious internet connection these datacenters have arent exactly cheap either.  Its not a matter of paying month to your cable company  its paying a couple thousand to have a line installed on top of monthly recurring costs that are nontrivial.Then comes the part of server hosting that a lot of people seem to be ignoring here  DDOS protection.  From a host this can easily cost more than the server itself.

1165441,1,t1_ci0m7zd,gt Were not trying to prevent server providers. Hosting servers costs money so charging for access is necessary. People who have bought Minecraft should not need to pay more money to access its game features.These contradict.  Connecting to a server is a game feature is it not? In any case what one privately run server does or does not do has no effect on the ability of the enduser to access game features.  It just alters their gameplay experience on one server.The problem is youre giving out instructions in generalities and ignoring the specifics.In my own community we run a couple of colocated servers and run several different types of game servers.  People who contribute to the server running costs get for instance reserved slot access to our Team Fortress  servers.  Would reserved slot access be against the rules for minecraft? If not whats the technical difference that distinguishes it from the diamond sword if you donate example?In minecraft we currently give donators a goldcoloured name as a mark of appreciation. Would that be against the rules for minecraft? If not whats the technical difference that distinguishes it from the diamond sword if you donate example?We let any player teleport to any other player to encourage collaborative building.  We also let donators teleport to spawn or their own beds.  Would that be against the rules for minecraft? If not whats the technical difference that distinguishes it from the diamond sword if you donate example?gtMinecraft hosting has become increasingly rogue and they mainly target kids which end up looking bad for both Minecraft and MojangThats fantastic and I have no inprinciple objections.

Minecraft multiplayer has to aspire to be a safe experience most of the time.Minecraft is predominantly a kids game Mojang has to behave accordingly. I think its awesome that they try to reign the abuse and exploitation in. Blaming the parents doesnt change anything about this situation. This is a huge problem and even though Mojang is not directly responsible they are in the best position to fix it. At least somewhat. Ok it may take time. The mod situation is in the same bad place but there at least its mostly about horrible user experience.From all their statements I think its very obvious that they are searching for a fair solution that differentiates.

1172266,0,t1_ci1gurw,If it ships even a small but substantial fragment of Minecraft code like traditional nonForge nonBukkit mods theyre considered derivative works. If they dont ship any code except their own they are plugins. Plugins tend to be fuzzier but generally arent regarded as derivative works although it greatly helps when a license agreement clarifies this.The thing is copyright isnt the only thing at play here. By downloading and running the game or its servers you must agree to Mojangs EULA. That EULA explicitly states you cant profit from mods or plugins interestingly I dont think external tools are included in that batch  after all most function even if youve never downloaded Minecraft to begin with and can even be created by people who havent downloaded anything to do with Minecraft.EULAs can be more complicated. In many jurisdictions you can be held accountable for violating any legal term of the agreement. Chances are where you live its legal. But some terms arent legal notably the we can change these terms any time without notifying you and you automatically agree without having to know about it part is illegal under German law so a German player who originally agreed to the old you can even sell mods EULA would only be bound to that until they explicitly agreed to the new one and could win a case in their jurisdiction Mojang would likely still terminate their account as I doubt thats illegal in German law.Obligatory I am not a lawyer.

The new rules make it legal for people to make money from servers.I for one never had issues with people paying for perks and have done it before myself. The problem Mojang have had is that kids are stealing their parents credit cards and racking up huge charges on servers for perks and such. Parents not understanding how the servers work blame Minecraft which turns into bad press among parents. I believe this was a motivator to start enforcing the EULA and update it to make it legal for servers to make money in ways Mojang are okay with.,Minecraft,ci9f7cw,4,t5_2r05i

Now it says you cannot profit off your mods.But thats kind of moot. That change to the EULA happened quite a while ago. This uproar has nothing to do with Mojang changing the EULA. It happened because people who hadnt read the EULA learned that they were breaking the existing EULA.

Adding effects to a map of very small squares can get messy quick which is what I feel happened in the first image to a very severe degree.Its a great tool idea. However its functionality should focus on ways of enhancing the pixel art maybe allow for increased blocks of colour per pixel for some opportunity for detail not highfidelity rendered effects.

I do still stand my ground on this though. Im tired of playing in a minecraft server where Richy Rich used his moms credit card to buy the  Super VIP package that comes with super weapons and armor making him always on top of the leaderboard. And this isnt just a small minority of servers this is almost Every. Damn. Server. Thats one reason why I enjoy the Play Mindcrack Server. They do it right. The only thing you can buy is the Patron status which grants you extra gold used to buy items for cosmetic purposes  more gold and experience and a colored username. All of this is profitable but it doesnt ruin the game for others. If thats all that Mojang is going to allow as far as microtransactions go then I am perfectly okay with that and servers should not struggle to survive like some think.

Let it run it shouldnt take long feel free to give up if it doesnt manage within  seconds.

1409953,0,t1_cit02ma,I used to think that way as well. Then I realized Im making emotional attachments to things that really neither demand or require one. Instead ask yourself what about the mod in question brings to your overall experience? Do you care about game balance and fear the mod will ruin it? Do you crave an addition to the simplistic base game? Do you wish for it to be harder or easier?Answering all these questions will help you get to the root of why you have an attachment to the base game.

1415919,0,t1_citqrrz,I do not know the exact time between carts.  It is just the amount of time it takes for the cart to travel  blocks so they are past the next repeater.  We use hopper timers for the delay at the station and have  items in the hopper but the server has a lower tick rate than single player.  On single player I think it is around  items in the hopper but not positive.You guessed it right with the redstone delays.  We convert it back into parallel to store into latches.  You can see it in THIS picture.   The signal is then triggered to be sent out via a detector rail.  So this answers your next question as well.  If a cart stops for whatever reason that isnt a problem as their ID is stored in the relay ahead of them and will only go to the next one once the detector rail is tripped.  One thing to be aware of though is that if you jump out or are stopped then there is a higher probability of a person behind you overwriting your ID as they go down the system.,Minecraft,citrimk,7,t5_2r05i

Which means you have to eat at least two highsaturation foods cooked meat golden carrotapple after each other. If you eat just one like it says in the video the best you can get it at is . with a golden carrot or most usually . with cooked beef or pork meaning youll run out of saturation faster and have to eat more frequently. Eating two at the same time will waste some saturation since its more than  but food is not an issue in Minecraft and youll have to eat less often.This is especially true if youre healing up if you eat just one food all the saturation will go to healing and youll have to eat again almost right away.,Minecraft,cixgxfr,1,t5_2r05i

1476806,0,t3_2b33oa,Disclaimer  I have never personally used a ramdisk but I did look into them a while back when I was first starting my server.  Also the below applies more to the server than client but is applicable to both.The ramdisk needs to have enough space to store the world  any configuration files.  If you are using plugins or mods it may need more as they often have databases to store extra information.  I believe there are nice ramdisks programs that can be larger than the actual amount of ram you have but they work by using both the ram and harddisk and constantly move data from ram to disk and ram to disk.  Unless you have one of those programs then I would not advise using a ramdisk with only GB of ram.  Depending on your OS I would leave MB  GB ram for the OS GBGB for the clientserver respectively which would leave GB  .GB of ram for the ramdisk.  Unless you have a very limited world I would recommend getting more ram or using an SSD instead.On another note since the anvil format was released the need for ramdisks at all has been greatly reduced.  The fileperchunk system that minecraft used to use has been replaced with a fileperchunks system that is much more efficient with disk readswrites.  A good SSD can easily keep up with the limited amount of file writing the game does and it will perform faster if you give the ram reserved for the ramdisk to the server as MC will perform its own threaded writecaching that prevents file writes from slowing down the game.  If you are using any modern version of minecraft I highly recommend you go with an SSD rather than a ramdisk.  And if not an SSD a nice RAID array would be overkill. Like I said I have never actually used a ramdisk with MC so take everything I say with a grain of salt.,Minecraft,cj1e5sw,1,t5_2r05i

1488759,0,t3_2b7on1,Id really like that heres a similar theoryYou know the Nether Reactor from Pocket Edition? You need to construct an incubator an Ender Reactor using Endstone and Obsidian. Any nearby endermites will burrow into the egg charging it. After enough are charged the Red Dragon hatches. Feeding the red dragon will cause it to grow up faster. When its fully grown Ender Dragon size it flies off and generates a layer within a few hundred blocks of wherever you hatched it. The dragon would live in the den and occasionally fly around to attack animals and attack monsters near the den. There would also be a Dragon Karma system. The hatcher automatically has  karma but everyone else would start out with  Dragon Karma. You gain Karma by giving the dragon gifts diamonds iron gold emeralds glowstone etc. doing quests kill creepers attacking my nest bring me some food etc. or other such things. You loose karma by attempting to attack the dragon It would kill you breathing flames and such stealing from its den and such things. Having high karma would cause the dragon to help you out such as not attacking your penned animals animals youve breeded several times or have saddledtamed saving you occasionally when youre in danger or letting you ride it Once landing it would fly back to its den and you wouldnt be able to attack people with its fire. Low karma would cause the dragon to attack your house summon mobs near you or hunt your animals.,Minecraft,cj2w2va,1,t5_2r05i

It is the same class as animals e.g. Lions Eagles Fish inanimate objects e.g. Hammers Cups Gauntlets or any of thousands of different possibilities.  What governing bodies that do exist in heraldry generally agree that almost anything can be used as a charge.Bricks are not very common but they do exist and are blazoned as masoned so red bricks divided by black lines would be gules masoned sable.  There are also patterns intended to look like honeycombs wheat fields or fish scales among others.Gradients are about the only thing you dont find in heraldry.

1542718,0,t1_cj9jbm6,I was a bit harsh though to be fair the condescending smilies and smug tone got me a little bit riled up.gt mojang would look a bit weird in court if it only sued a few of them and at the same time saying the EULA didnt allow anything.This is the part I was trying to clarify. Regardless of whether they would look weird it wouldnt matter at all. Legally that is  completely and totally fine. It might seem weird to you but it would not seem weird at all to a court.Thats what I meant about the lack of obligation to enforce a EULA theres nothing wrong or even questionable about deciding to enforce one part of it but not the others enforcing the bit about paytowin items and not cosmetic items for instance. Theyre not obligated to enforce different parts of the EULA equally. Thats not how contracts like EULAs work. Legally they are absolutely allowed to pick and choose what suits they want to pursue  no court would have any problem with them claiming that the EULA forbids all sales but that theyre only pursuing people who sell certain kinds of items. In fact they could be even more arbitrary  they could just decide that they dont like hypixels server Im only using that name since its one of the only popular servers I actually know the name of and bring a suit for breach of the EULA while ignoring everyone else violating it. No court would have a problem with that.They could actually start bringing suits right now without coming up with a new EULA  simply by enforcing the current EULA only for cosmetic items. Theres nothing legally questionable about that not even a little bit. The decision to make a new EULA that explicitly allows for cosmetic items is a protection for server owners because it means Mojang cant just decide to start enforcing the old EULAs restrictions on cosmetic items at some point in the future.And I agree that actually sending out the new EULA before implementing it would have been good. Unfortunately Mojang pretty consistently fails to make common sense PR decisions like that though.Im less sure that it would have precluded the hate were seeing. I think the hate were seeing is unfortunately a lot more basic than that there are people who were making money for a thing and now they cant make money from that thing. Whether the change is ethical or not those people are going to be vocally unhappy either way. And they have a lot of followers who are going to be vocal either way too.gt talking about specific things in the blog post is a bit useless because we dont know how it will transfer into the official documentThis bit I still dont think I agree with. I dont really see how the actual EULAs text is going to be much more clear than the informal guidelines theyve already described. Theyve been pretty explicit about what the changes are going to be.,Minecraft,cj9njja,1,t5_2r05i

1546947,0,t3_2bwrp3,What would really help this chart is if it was correct.Exhibit A Enderdragons do not spawn in the underworld but rather in the way overworld being the end which is located in the Sky biome so it would be more correct but still wrong if the Enderdragon had been listed as spawning in the overworld. Also Enderdragons do not do fireballs but do melee combat list that the mode of melee you choose.Exhibit B Withers can also be spawned in the End and in the Nether not just the overworld so adding the underworld would technically suffice. Also withers are incapable of melee combat but are capable of ranged combat which does not fit the criteria of fireball or arrow attack. In addition they could also be given the attack category of explode as their projectiles are explosive and it causes an explosion when its health reaches the maximum upon spawning.Exhibit C Spider jockeys are capable of melee and ranged combat as it is a combination of a skeleton and spider and has a resulting  hearts for a total of  health.Exhibit D Witches only have  hearts not  for a total of  health. They also throw potions not shoot fireballs.Exhibit E Magma cubes and slimes both have health levels that include  hearts  hearts and half a heart totaling to respectively   and  health.Exhibit F Cave spiders have  hearts as opposed to  for a total of  health.Exhibit G Blazes have  hearts as opposed to  for a total of  health.,Minecraft,cja6m3x,3,t5_2r05i

And Im pretty pissed about it having plans to help Syrenova here make his system easier to set up via NBTEdit plugins and as a creative player who enjoyed using those blocks. Im appalled that theres been no statement that weve found about a replacement for these features. No inclusion of these quirky but VERY useful blocks as official blocks. No NBT tags that villagers and recipes will read.In other words this update is basically a big fuck you to the more advanced creative minds in our community.Edit Read WildBluntHickoks post.

You should be complying with the EULA by the end of today. That is their plan. You dont need a god damn legal paper to understand that and I have no clue as to why you think you would.The blogs are about as official as it gets until they actually start moving out which could be anytime after today. They never said We will have all the papers ready on August st. They said today was the day you needed to be prepared.,Minecraft,cje8lfu,-5,t5_2r05i

How many infringing servers did they take down before the clarification? None. You have no reason to believe they will enforce the EULA any differently than they did when it was less clear.Sadly this post will probably be downvoted too thats fine. I just hope youre not setting yourself up for disappointment when Mojang doesnt start dropping infringing servers.,Minecraft,cjeaxj1,5,t5_2r05i

1634204,0,t3_2d189t,Im upset because Jeb isnt in sole contact with me to add every feature I want.The newer updates are great . completely changed redstone . completely changed the entire overworld and . is adding so much small stuff that lets people who want to focus on creating mapscustom contents and just general building do a lot more while also completely reworking the back end so they can actually work on the mod API which they sort of are with the command block stuff instead of just hacking in it until it works. theyve also setup realm servers that are dead easy to purchase and run.also lets not forget notch is sort of a horrible developer minecraft is a good idea but his execution of it was pretty sloppy and he just kept hacking in new stuff instead of fixing the whole game so that stuff can be added easily. and now that mc is so far into development redoing that work has only become harder but more important as they want to let people change anything they want.this plethora of content is also meant to keep people happy and interested while they do behind the scene reworking. mojang would receive huge amounts of crap if they didnt add new content but actually fixed stuff thats been broken since the start.also youre forgetting that its still months between updates youre not obligated to play on snapshots theyre meant for bug testing and feedback. after the . update you got something like over a dozen more biomes dozens of new blocks and a bunch of other stuff not just a bunch of flowers but apparently this isnt equivalent to a place with  new blocks a bunch of lava and two mobs. the updates under Jen have been far better than under notch and Jeb and the rest of the devs actually care about how their game runs and making sure bugs get fixed instead ignoring everything and adding a bunch of poorly thought half finished ideas.,Minecraft,cjl5n2r,2,t5_2r05i
1634750,0,t3_2d1dqo,Id recommend Archemedes Ships which adds the ability to transform structures into boats or airships. Build an airship  of the structure has to be balloon blocks and include plenty of chests. No one said it had to be enclosed either. I often go for a Star Wars YWing meets Lobos Space Motorcycle look. Just add chests to the side as if they were saddlebags. A LOT of saddlebags.The only drawback is if you get killed along the way you might lose the ship!

1636164,0,t3_2d1mqg,You cant use minecraftblockname or resoucepackblockname for this. Because the game will read the block minecraftemeraldstairs example and dont know what block is. Where is this information? At the resoucepack in the client.But I have a solution. BlockStates.The solution is create a new BlockState DataTag named Custom and a number value  to Infinite. And in the JSON archive of the texture add a section for give a number of the Custom tag to this texture.How works?. A texture called emeraldstairs example on the blocks textures folder.. A JSON archive on the same folder named exactly like the texture archive OF THE VANILLA BLOCK. . Inside it give the value  example and the name of the custom texture archive.. Minecraft will read the JSON archive like now and when see the vanilla block with BlockState Custom  set to  show you the emeraldstairs texture.Excuse my english.

Hes expressing the theme of relentlessness through the process of creating a big hole and dumb mechanical rote work is exactly what makes this a relentless build. A work of the same size but lacking the monotony wouldnt be able to convey the same feeling as this partly because the payoff wouldnt be worth the time like you pointed out thats another reason why this conveys relentlessness so well  its unending unchanging and above all a massive task to undertake for an end product that is underwhelming  but only if you dont consider the relentless effort that goes into it. It might not be the pinnacle of originality or creativity but as is with a lot of art the difference between the artist and the people who say anyone could do it is that they actually did it. ,Minecraft,cjmyfwh,138,t5_2r05i

1730820,0,t3_2e9j7d,So the old story goesOn a beautiful autumn day in the year  Samwell Halfpenny a wealthy businessman from the sea town of Farah was out rabbit hunting with a few of his associates along the northern bank of the Scarlet.  As the men made their way along the river they intersected a small brook flowing briskly out of the woods from the north. Intrigued by the waters origin Samwell convinced his hunting party to venture with him along the sparkling stream and deep into the forest. It wasnt long before the group happened upon the most beautiful little hollow that they had ever seen.  Large oak and pine trees ringed the creek and cast bluish shadows on the carpet of green grass.  Everything about the place looked like it came right out of a painting except for a small dilapidated shack hunched over in the shadow of a massive oak tree. From the moment he laid eyes on the hollow and all of its beauty Samwell knew it had to be his. The land would make a perfect place precisely between Farah and Ambervale for a quiet little community  for those who had the coin of course. Samwell surmised the decaying abode to be the temporary quarters of another hunter since animal hides were hanging all along the outside walls. Halfpenny knocked on the door of the shack but nobody was home.  The businessman then produced a quill and some paper from his jacket and proceeded to offer the owner of the shack and presumably the surrounding land a generous sum in which they only need reply with a letter of acceptance to his offices in Farah. The very next day Samwell had arrived at the steps of his workplace to find the piece of paper with his offer nailed to the large wooden door. Across its surface the word NO was scrawled in deep black charcoal ... ,Minecraft,cjxc1wr,4,t5_2r05i

The only context we had were the other posts that were made around the time they were hired.Emphasis mine.Here bukkit.org announces that the team was hired as Mojang employees  Nowhere does it say anything about the project just that the team a group of people was hired.gt I am extremely pleased and proud to announce that as of today the Bukkit team has joined Mojang. When discussing the possibility of a modding API publicly Mojang was concerned that they would be unable to provide the community with a suitable and powerful enough solution and we honestly feel that our experience building Bukkit will help them do so. Thanks to our work with Bukkit we have a years worth of experience failures and lessons to help us develop a proper modding API and intend to do whatever it takes to produce one that satisfies the needs of the community. Now that we have an opportunity to design the official Minecraft API we intend to make it a suitable replacement for Bukkit if not a significantly better one while bukkit.org will remain a community for modders for the foreseeable future.More context official announcement from Mojang  This time its really clear Mojang explictly refers to them as four developers being hired.  Only people can be developers.gt Today we can announce that the four main developers of bukkit  a communitybased Minecraft server implementation  have joined ranks with Mojang to bring you the same flexibility and versatility to the official Minecraft server. The four Warren Loo evilseph Erik Broes grum Nathan Adams dinnerbone and Nathan Gilbert tahgtahv will work on improving both the server and the client to offer better official support for larger servers and server modifications.So given all the context at the time the only way to read the post from Dinnerbone that makes sense is that acquire us means they acquired the people.,Minecraft,ck9d4rq,9,t5_2r05i

If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it youre almost certainly a spammer. As a rule of thumb for every post promoting your own videos you should have made  other submissions or comments on other posts. Bear in mind that pointless comments like nice and lol do not count as actual contribution. If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of your own videos and additionally if you do not participate in this community in other ways for example by submitting other content or joining the discussion on other posts you are a spammer.

I was encouraged when Mojang actually incorporated a few early mods into the game itself and then hired the Bukkit team to work on the mod API.However the last six months have been very discouraging.  As specious as some of the EULA and Bukkit drama is it makes it clear that Mojang is willing to adopt policies that alienate invested community members like modders and server hosts.  Microsoft to the extent that they are involved in development will be even more willing to ignore us.

A sun with a single planet Krikkit inside a dust cloud so the sky is blank. At night theres nothing to see in the sky and in the day theres only the sun which you shouldnt look directly at so they dont. Theyve developed a  degree blind spot. Then one day a spaceship crashes on their planet. As it drops out of the sky they look around for the noise. Left right forwards and backwards even down. None of them think to look up. Because in their minds there is no up. And then it finishes crashing and they see it and suddenly in there minds there IS an up. And they all scream as their perception of the universe is violently torn away and a whole other spacial dimension is added to their worldview. It mustve been like getting a limb chopped off but the limb is part of your mind not part of your body. Its no wonder they went a little crazy. They reverse engineered a spaceship from the wreckage sent their planets first astronauts up and they got their first glimpse of the rest of the universe. Their verdict? Well.

1906549,0,t1_ckiwmh5,gt If you look at actual numbers you would realize that OS X is far more a danger to Microsoft on the desktop than Linux.There are numbers and there is numerology... lets see gt Apple has captured something like  of the desktop market in the US over the last  years regardless of requiring special hardware.Both Apple and Microsoft are not catering to US exclusively they are operating worldwide. And worldwide MS has a nearmonopoly on operating systems. You can walk into a shop in Beijing Delhi Moscow or Berlin and see the vast majority of computers sold with Windows preinstalled. On top of that consumers of USA are not in the same position as elsewhere Apple could get to where it is because it is more affordable in the US than in say China India or even the EU.gt Linux still hovers around  at this point.Theres a problem with Linux and its  how do you count? Sales? But it is normally not sold at least not in the major retail points. Downloaded? But a single installer medium could be used on many computers. Webcounters? Theres not a single counterstatisticanalytics service comprehensive on a worldwide scale and even then most of those have a biased sample anyway because they are installed by webmasters who so choose.gt but Linux isnt even a distant consideration on the desktop right now for a number of reasonsIt actually is for exactly the very reason I provided Linux and Windows are interchangeable. Switching to Apples OS X is accompanied by a financial burden. Presenting the case of major competition occurring between Apple and Microsoft is like claiming that the Ultimate Burger in Boston and Burger Emporium in New York are direct competitors the number of people who will find getting to another city to get to a fastfood joint a negligible obstacle is minuscule. For all practical purposes The Ultimate Burger will only compete with some Bumfuck Eatery in the same Boston even if The Ultimate Burger serves  monthly Burger Emporium serves  monthly and Bumfuck Eatery serves  to  at most.gt I dont see any reason Microsoft would stop development of Minecraft on Linux as long as it continues to sellNot necessarily stop. They can just stop giving a shit about it. For example stop testing new releases if they work on Linux. Technically they wont be deliberately breaking anything but that would be the most likely outcome anyway. They also can find that they can use Linux has such a minor share that selling Linuxusers Minecraft was not profitable in their advertising for obvious purposes.gt just like they wont stop selling Office for Mac.They are selling Office for Mac because it is not dangerous for them people who already have Apples computer wont run to windows to run office and people who have Wintel machines wont shell out a grand or two to run OS X just because and Im horrified to imagine how much it would cost in places like Brazil or Australia.

1919177,0,t1_ckk58ep,I believe the main reason mods are so shunned here is... usually posts are meant to impress or interest. When you work with usergenerated content the impress is reduced drastically on a more general community. One of the biggest issues is anyone could create any content to achieve anything so in many cases it seems less impressive to achieve something using them. Not saying all cases are as such but you are working with external variables introduced. Another prominent issue is that you must understand what the mod is the difficulty to achieve what youve done using the mod and so on. People usually find focus in specific areas of mod packs let alone individual mods so understanding is very specific.Just a few thoughts on why this reddit feels so geared toward vanilla. The reddit is about Minecraft which everyone here should have some knowledge. From there additions outside the scope of vanilla lose that universal connection.I personally prefer vanilla because it follows established limits everyone should understand. I played Technic Pack for a while back when that was popular and while I enjoyed creating things with the mod additions I found less people to interact with about them. It felt lonelier than to follow vanilla and I do find more enjoyment in creating what I can with it.,Minecraft,ckkg4sa,10,t5_2r05i

If Im looking for specs on it I have to look up which one we actually bought as Macbooks have been notoriously difficult to distinguish from oneanothergtApple loves to throw curveballs with model names. Weve had to differentiate between several types of MacBook for example. Some are easy MacBook Air but some are a terrible problem  the white polycarbonate MacBook comes to mind. Several flavors of the polycarbonate MacBook look almost exactly the same outside but have distinctly different layouts once opened. The problem is compounded by the fact that all have the same model number A and no other unique identifier.gt We understand this is somewhat of a gray area so heres an examplegtThe original polycarbonate MacBook was just called MacBook.gtThe second iteration of the MacBook came out but switched processors from Core Duo to Core  Duo. So we made another device page for the second MacBook MacBook Core  Duo and called the original MacBook Core Duo.gtApple released an updated Core  Duo machine but internally the machine stayed mostly the same. We made no changes to the device page but amended the repair guides with alternate pictures for the new model.gtApple then released an allnew MacBook with an aluminum unibody design. We created another device page for this new machine MacBook Unibody Model A.gtAs of October  a new polycarbonate MacBook came out also as a unibody design.

The first portal you shouldnt need to do anything with but youll find that the second portal will take you to same portal in the nether thats fine. Go to your second portal in the overworld and note the x and z coordinates. Grab a calculator and divide them both by . Then go into the nether and build another portal at those coordinates you just worked out then it will link to your second portal and youll have your nice easy travel between islands.If it still doesnt work get the coordinates of your first overworld portal and check its partner in the nether to make sure they match up properly. Nether portals generate in the nether in the matching coordinates usually but if there isnt a clear space to generate the portal at that spot it will move it to the closest space that is valid so you may need to move it to match exactly.Hope that helps!EDIT Fixed where I said y instead of z.

2149773,0,t3_2jmjof,When keepInventory is off midgame is the worst. The criteria Im using is one of the worst things that can happen dying and losing all your items such as dying in lava.Earlygame your items are made of common materials that can be easily replaced.Lategame you have enough backup items to easily replace any items you lost.But with midgame you have limited supplies of mediumrarity materials such as iron. This is especially a problem before . when iron was rarer and on large servers where most of the iron in caves the best source of iron have already been mined out and meduimrarity resources are generally scarce.That exact situation happened to me once. I was clearing away an underground lava pool foolishly not bringing a water bucket or putting everything away except for some blocks and a pick. I mined a block lava poured out I tried to get out of the lava instead of blocking it up botched that up by placing a block died and all my items were gone. I was wearing some iron armor and had an iron pick and some iron ore in my inventory. I couldnt find any more iron after that.,Minecraft,cld32qo,1,t5_2r05i

2257713,0,t1_clq9fsu,We spent alot of time working on the interior for this project so you should find the inside just as interesting as the exterior.The ceiling of the main factory stretches to  blocks high including  blocks of a basement floor however some areas of the build stretch higher  for instance the central statue which goes to world height  starting from  blocks high.This was built in default texture pack and so hopefully no pack will suit it better The original map this was built on did have ore generation so in the few spaces of unbuilt terrain you will be able to find ore .And finally making it move is the ultimate goal. The build shows the potential for movement on a huge scale and if possible wed like to perhaps make this an adventure map with components moving around etc.Please download the map here  to check it out for yourself.,Minecraft,clqrw3j,2,t5_2r05i

We had been playing for about an hour and a half we were living in a village and I being the only one who had ever played a serious survival world before was the only one with iron diamonds an enchantment table and potions. I tamed a dog and named her Wolfieta. I don t know why but I always get attached to my pets in MC. Wolfieta was sitting outside my village house and Sara and Kenzie were PVPing over something stupid. I was in my house enchanting and brewing potions. I had a Sharp IV diamond sword but they didnt  know that. All of a sudden Sara kills Kenzie. Then she runs into my house and tries to hit me with her stone sword and no armor while I was distracted. Wolfieta unsits and starts attacking Sara. Sara runs out of my house and at about  hearts KILLS MY DOG. I run outside yelling YOU KILLED WOLFIETA!!! I drink a strength potion and start chasing Sara around the village. Sara runs into her house but I follow her in and  hit kill her. Then for some reason Kenzie yells YOU DONT MESS WITH A GIRLS WOLF. SHELL SHANK YOU.

But half the game is about modding and if Mojang do something so huge such as kill off the modding community days after the actual Microsoft acquisition took place the game wouldnt be a game anymore. People are already mad about Microsoft buying Mojang but if Microsofts first move is to kill modding?Nope. I would like limitations to be made for modding perhaps purchasableearnable modding licenses so as to disallow people coding hacked clients but killing off the modding community will kill Minecraft.I agree it is bad  I know a server the sole use of which is for coders to try and make better clients than each other  basically a server where they compare the size of their penises and I agree its not a good way to play.

2406759,0,t3_2mzf9m,A plugin called MyPet. I had never seen a server that would let you capture and use pets in such a manner although I wish the owner of the server had put a sign down that said which mobs were donor only. I ended up beating a ghast to death with a leash thats how you tame all normally untamable mobs kill them whilst holding a leash only to be disappointed. The MyPet plugin allows you to tame any mob even boss mobs if youre crazy enough to try and gives you the option of having a skill tree. They level up first from you killing mobs while they follow you and later through having them kill for you. Its an awesome plugin but it seems no decent servers run it. The server I played with it on went modded and removed it. Needless to say the server eventually went kaput. I really wish servers would use this more. I loved getting into PvP fights along side my wither skeleton without the wither effect I had decked in full diamond.Btw the plugin has a configurable amount of storage for pets so you can have by default up to ten pets each with any one of the six default skill trees. The best thing about this plugin though is that it is fully configurable. Of course this means the owneradmins have full control over how many skill trees are available what mobs are donor only how many one person can have etc. Its just an awesome plugin.One more thing though. Even though very few servers run it Ive checked around and there dont seem to be any major or gamebreaking bugs it doesnt appear to cause server lag and its supposedly simple to install on a server. I have no idea why there are so few servers that run it. If anyone could tell me of a decent sized server  players average thatd be great.,Minecraft,cm96ngf,6,t5_2r05i

After that Hemple post HouseTemple as in they spawned too close together and merged nicely I made a world called Hemple based on someones seed.   Created a world just to do world breaking stuff on that I called Sui as in suicide.   Been pasting some of my old xbox worlds onto a single patchwork map so Ive been looking at my old world names. Bad Pass made a sheet of lava waterfall  blocks wide in a U shape blocking off a desert pass in survival thank you very much although the name is a reference to the seed being  like the Spaceballs gag Currytopia its what I was cooking when I created the world Yungle Growing City I tried to stick to one world for awhile and my very first world Cydonia named after a great electronic album by The Orb.   Worldie was the one I used for my  Elements Spellbook post a few months back I misspelled it as Worldey on the post    Busy Bee was one I worked on for awhile. No idea why I chose the name. I tend to be VERY spurofthemoment with my names.   NotOnSteamLegally was one I created during the . snapshots. Reference to a post about someone creating a kickstarter on steams indie game developers section for an indie game Im creating called Minecraft. Zero effort to disguise the scam. I think he was only aiming for  but luckily someone complained about it here and it got shut down. This was before I heard you could use steam as a launcher for any game to integrate it with steams chat I assume.   InsideOutTest.

So many bizarre experiments warping the laws of minecraft physics so little time...   Layered was a Customized worldtype with the top quarter of the underground starting from sea level almost all dirt the next quarter Andesite the rd quarter doirite and the bottom quarter granite. Of course diamond mining gives you mountains of granite.

OhMyGodICantBelieveItWorks was my first world on Minecraft . the fully playable  April Fools gag version of minecraft.   Wanderland is one I have on modded .. BetterWorldGeneration being the main mod for that profile.

Devestated Lanscape was my first PC Edition world. I didnt notice the typo until later missed the d in land. Its an attempt at mapmaking a doctor who adventure. The tardis is really just a transmat. You step into a normal interior and onto a pressure plate which teleports you to the next location outside the tardis. Its supposed to be an artificial cutframe but its a really iffy technique that kind of doesnt work well. Breaks the suspension of disbelief and all that.   Hellscape was my nd or rd PC map. During that first month it was my attempt to stick to  map for a change to get lots of stuff built up.

Also if they really wanted to they could have hired the Forge guys and had them build Forge into the base game so it is always up to date with each release and available to develop against.

2563939,0,t1_cmt8290,gt It might be out of ignorance in which case please enlighten me but wouldnt this be a Minecraftprivate version of Java that would only run specifically for Minecraft and therefore not vulnerable to third party apps? Because Minecraft is the one and only app using it?It is not a private version of Java just a version of Java shipped with the software which the software is configured to use. It is still a binary on disk which could be referenced  have software executed against it just like any other JRE binary.Imagine the following scenario ignore version numbers Minecraft ships version .. with Java .. Vulnerabilities are discovered in Java .. that causes a security drop now Oracle is shipping Java ... If Minecraft does not then bundle test and ship a new version lets call it .. containing the fixed binaries we now have a security delta between most recent stable .. and the version shipped with Minecraft ...If the pattern emerges such that Minecraft doesnt ship fixes as quickly as we would like YESTERDAY then suddenly weve introduced another attack vector. Some malicious actor could then reasonably saygt Well I know that Minecraft is running an outdated version of Java which suffers from exploit soandso  I can now execute my exploit against that vendored version of Java instead of a more likely to be patched system Java.The base issue really is that any company the vendors their own dependencies needs to have people whose job it is to keep on top of the various dependencies their versions and known exploits.Adds work for the developer to do right in order to gain convenience for the consumer.EDITTo be clear I do prefer a nonshared dependency model all other things being equal but it does take quite a bit of thought effort and commitment to do it properly.,Minecraft,cmt8tm9,2,t5_2r05i

If you cant find a good spot generate a new world and spend max  ingame day trying to find a good spot. If you fail again just settle on the first cave  hill  beach  valley  you can see.Be carefull with terraforming removing the odd dirtblock is obviously fine but no mass clearing or flattening. Work with what the world gives you.My personal style is to make  giant base that has it all others like to build more of a village  different buildings for different purposes.Whatever your gaming style is let it flow with the terrain. A nice mountain makes building quite challangingI think the easiest way to get a fun base is to find a large cavesystem and make that your base.

2856626,0,t3_2sttxf,I wrote a program to do this a few weeks ago. I needed to migrate a small  player SMP server to Realms but theyll only let you upload a world if its less than MB. Some of our players love to explore so theyve traveled many thousands of blocks just to explore.I also dont know for sure everything that everyone has built. My strategy was to determine a set of blocksentities that generate naturally and remove chunks that only contain those. I also have it prune furthest from spawn first working its way in and will stop when the world is down to MB.EDIT I did not clean up the code there once I got a version that worked for my world I committed what I have. Also make sure you run this against a backup of the world. I tweaked settings for days and kept rerunning it until I was confident it was right.,Minecraft,cnssrg3,8,t5_2r05i

I feel like they break a bit of the surrealism IMHO and just seeing wheat D is so satisfying!Id say the best thing to do is mix the D and D textures together because most of the criticism the D model is getting is that wheat is suppose to be thin and that it does no cover the patch of dirt well enough.

Try and make a script before you start recording record the footage and then record your voice. this will make it look more professorial and overall cleaner . try and get a pop filter or move the mic a bit to the rightleft so youre not talking directly into it this might not irritate a lot of people but it does make it a cleaner video this is really important if you are making the content youre making . make your titles nicer having all caps in some is something people mostly dont like just as Every Single Word A Capital. this goes back to  and  if you have problems pronouncing words like you are. try and talk slower and speed it up a little later. if you do this correctly it shouldnt sound to weird for example with Audacity on how to speed up a song with out a chipmunk voice notice how he doenst have a pop filter holding the mic to close. over all try and keep your videos length a bit more regular its strange seeing a  second video and than the play list takes me to a way longer video  ,Minecraft,cod813j,3,t5_2r05i

3101599,0,t1_coj8nld,gt Okay wow theres a lot wrong with this. Your GPU certainly cares about how much detail is in a texture resolution. Maybe not entirely with Minecraft but you didnt specify you generalized. If a game is running hundreds of textures with the choice of either x or x one is going to have better performance than the other. Games like Arma let you choose resolutions per texture group effects particles model textures enviro textures etc. Between x and x there is a difference in FPS. Your computer may be good enough to not notice this but not everyones is.Yeah I worded that badly I didnt mean it doesnt matter but that it has a minimal impact at relatively small resolutions.  I should have specified but after x my computer does start to have a VERY noticeable impact very quickly due the the exponential growth of standard texture resolutions.  gt  Finally there is most definitely a difference in FPS between x and x. A difference that a lot of people has evidence of.I just tested this on my laptop AMD radeon HD  GPU with minecraft and there was no difference.  Of course that is just my system and it is fairly new.  Im sure older cards would have more trouble.Also something I forgot to put in my comment I am not saying optifine does not help in fact on every system I have ever played on optifine has given me at least a  FPS boost.  With MC .. on my laptop it doubles performance.  On my schools ancient  year old XP monsters it gives x FPS.  On my sisters computer MC is unplayable without optifine.,Minecraft,cojh9pc,1,t5_2r05i

One of the snapshots for instance had a pretty big world corruption bug you can argue snapshots dont count as much as you want but it is still a release of the game in any form that wasnt caught. Older releases had the same issues on minor and even major releases. This isnt new and a company with as many resources as they do should be able to get people to test before they ship to launcher. Minor releases are considered stable generally this shouldnt include such a bug as was in the .. server.,Minecraft,corsrve,3,t5_2r05i

3211594,0,t3_2wwk67,Shaders are little programs that are compiled by and run directly on the video card.  When all is said and done what they produce is the specifics of what color pixel to paint where on the screen.So they work with texture packs just fine the texture pack is what provides the colors for the pixel when the shader eventually calculates what it needs.  There are many different implementations of the shader programs that can be used Sonic Ethers SEUS Slidurs and Chocapics just to name three.  What you have to do to use shaders is first add the GLSL Shader Core module to your Minecraft then download one of the shader packs and place it in a directory .minecraftshaderpacks similar to how you add resource packs.  If the Shader Core module activates the Options menu in the game will now give you an additional button to select the shaders you want to use much like you select a resource pack.  If you go to the minecraft forums and look for the Shader Core thread you will see a list of many of the available shader packs.And the various shader packs are different and will make the game look different.  One might have a more orange color for a torch light where another might have faster moving plants.  It all depends on what the shader author wanted to do.  Since the shaders themselves are just a collection of text files in a zip archive you can actually read the code and make some changes if you learn GLSL programming.  I know for example that Chocapics shaders control many aspects via define flags and you can turn off those you dont like.  Other shader packs do similar things.,Minecraft,couvr7m,4,t5_2r05i

3217223,0,t1_covdzqv,They are exploiting a feature known as combining characters which is built into Unicode. It is primarily meant to be used for adding symbols such as    on top of letters which are not already standard in Unicode. Example We have  but we dont necessarily have a  above an X should you ever need that.AFAIK know there is no real limit to how many Unicode characters you can stack on top of each other as you just keep saying this and that which causes the text editor or web browser to draw that symbol on top of the previous one instead of advancing a position.When converting a text to Zalgo you just append a bunch of random symbols to each character. Like this! Notably if you paste such a text in and then try to backspace each corrupted character shows that they are really many because only one symbol is erased at a time. So if you try to copypaste the messedup text above and then erase it you will have to hold backspace for several seconds before you get rid of the whole word.Its best to use an online tool for corrupting as its cumbersome to do manually. I dont know if you can even write the formatting for these special characters using only a Notepad or a basic forum post editor. Id need to Google some more for that. P,Minecraft,covgtfd,1,t5_2r05i

3299617,0,t1_cp46va6,Just to clarify the second will not work mainly because the kill command does not support dataTags.Even though scoreboard is available as an alternative for selection it wont work that easily either. Equipment slots that do not have an item will simply contain an empty compound. The way list detection works in commands is by scanning the entire list for each individuallydefined item having id four times is redundant and would only be needed once though it doesnt function anyway. This also means that checking for a bow would look in all slots not the hand slot.It is not possible to directly detect an empty slot nor any specific slots in the Equipment list as the Slot item tag is unused. Normally a way around this is to assign a score assuming that all targets are not wearing something and then reset their score if they are actually holding something. Again due to how detection works you cant do a simple check if tag exists. You need to give it a value which means you must also use many many scoreboard commands to reset scores for various armor types.Summary you cannot directly detect empty or specific slots in the Equipment and youll have to use many scoreboard commands in order to properly assign a score to the intended targets as uPmk has done.,Minecraft,cp4dsgs,1,t5_2r05i

They drop meat sure but cows sheep rabbits and chickens also drop meat plus those four animals drop additional items leather wool hidelegs and featherseggs so the pig is made useless by four other animals. They were used for riding but not only was the feature not good but also it has now been replaced with horses.However I think people are missing the point and my complaint about pigs is hypocritical of this I know but I think the point isnt to name something that just doesnt have a use but instead name something that gets in your way.

The point I was getting at was that theyre very basic things and shouldnt be more than a short command away.free h vs GetWMIObject Class winOperatingSystem.FreePhysicalMemory  and the PowerShell version wont report the memory to you in readable units and wont give you info about cache or swap for example.gt The last point about command line text editors isnt a feature of Bash or even GNU. Linux distros ship with a default commandline text editor. Windows does not. Thats not really a direct critique of Powershell. You can install a command line text editor and invoke it via Powershell if you feel like it just like you can choose to install emacs or vim on Linux if they dont come as default in your particular distro.Youre right bash by itself does not have very many features. It relies on lots of external utilities. But thats fine thats what a shell is for.The thing is that PowerShell offers a remoting feature and its massively gimped because of shortcomings like I described the lack of a text editor being just one of them. Yes you can install your own... but shouldnt there be one there ready to use?

3351155,0,t1_cp96a9d,gtThere are two ways to reach a broader audience make the game easier or implement difficulties. Making the game easier is easier on the devs but implementing difficulties is better for the players and its better for the developers as well because itll reach more people than with just casual play.First of all this paragraph contradicts the rest of your comment. Also cant resist but point out that with broader audiences its inevitable quantity over quality. Its one or the other.gtYour view is closedminded and is the only real threat to gaming. Im guessing you call yourself a real gamer? The fact that you resist the idea of having casual play as just an option in Addition to challenging play is asinine. What are you trying to accomplish? All that would do is exclude people from the gaming world which is the only way to kill it. A broader audience grows the gaming world maybe not in the genre you like but more people become exposed to gaming and possibly venture into other genres.Second of all I do not call myself anything. Casual play is alright in my book its casualization that I dislike. The dumbing down of games of formerly higher difficulty.gtEveryone started with some game which was most likely simple and straightforward.

3453866,0,t3_2zsucu,i wish i had the exact knowledge of the specifics in the latest PC version but previously there were some rules that still apply to the console editions.  minimum of  villagers   doors to spawn golems the variance of the spawn horizontally is around  blocks from the center of the village and a few blocks vertically. This is why older golem farm designs are  x  in size and  water layers. there are rules for what is a valid door basically one side of the door needs sky access to count. link to MC wiki for the technicals In survival I have had  iron golem farms. The first one was  villagers   doors around a  x  block square. This design had the villagers spaced  blocks apart in pods on the sides of the square all individually with  doors on each pod. It works very well sometimes even spawning  back to back so they are in the killing area at the same time. With the villagers separated they do not breed with each other because of the  block gap between them and they are available for trading easily due to not being boxed into the small pods all together.I also built a smaller one with only  villagers and around  doors its noticeably slower but still functions. Looks just like the one you built only a tad larger.You may have to trade with them to promote spawning or something on regular Minecraft hopefully a PC player will chime in on this for you if that is the case...anyway thats what I know about it hopefully it helps you.

3466661,0,t3_2zx8yr,Personally I think the addition of underground biomes would spice up the caving experience. Im not saying they have to be everywhere but it would be cool to run into an underground forest with an opening to the surface. Even artic caves would be a nice touch. Cave exploring tools would be nice like a hook and rope to scale walls. Could save for digging stairways up high points in areas like ravines. I would also like more cost effective tools for digging. I believe Feed the Beast has a hammer that destroys a x section of rock. Something like that so youre not scrounging up diamonds after clearing all of your bases nearby chunks of them. Obviously it should be pretty costly. Honestly I think there is a lot of untapped potential for the cavingunderground aspect of the game.Edit After reading some of the comments I think more underground passive or neutral mobs would be nice.

Its almost funny how trivial it is.Reimplementing the old terrain gen might be easy but it would take significantly more than two seconds. And asking a terrain gen modder to do something doesnt make the task easier it just gets someone else to do it.On another note  Is it really worth it to add beta terrain however easy it might be? People who love beta terrain obsessively represent a very small portion of the community  small enough that they can generally be satisfied by using terrain mods or reverting to older versions.

Apparently we were the first few people to be on his server and he was a really nice guy in general. He helped us with building homes and was a good sport about everything. I remember he had a mountain that hed made that  had a base jump at the top but he couldnt think of a name for it. So I suggested Mt. PWN and he was all for it. Eventually the server gained a group of people who were friends me and my brother included and we had a really good time. I just have so many fond memories of that server.

Some of the general improve performance ideas might help you a VERY little bit in singleplayer but in general you just have to deal with it.As I understand it the issue is that the players movement is clientside while the movement of other entities is serverside.  Even in singleplayer the design distinction is still relevant.  The problem is that these things are independent but need to be kept in sync over an async logical connection.

3846385,0,t1_cqubzc0,No offense to the Mojang crew but Minecraft is an amazingly designed game but a rather meh designed program. I think amazing designed game is straightforward enough but let me explain the meh designed program. Its built on top of the Light Weight Java Game Library lwjgl which is really not meant for something as complex as Minecraft. All of the changes and add on code to make the game is by Mojangs own repeated admissions messy. This started out as a hobby for notch and even when it moved to a full time job for him most additions came about as ooo thats a good idea let me add that! As such the code got less organized. Adding features in this manner will result in messy code in  of all cases.Now  years ago they said modding API soon. Then they realized that many big underlying things within the game will have to get changed to make it work. such as item IDs becoming item names So soon became an inaccurate prediction because the amount of work to do was much larger then initially thought. Fine. I can live with that they made a miscalculation and spoke too soon. Now its five years later and really a LOT of things have happened to the game. And yes even some of those things are towards the goal of the modding API but many are not. If anything my objection is that Mojang has ignored the painful and annoying code rewrites necessary for the modding API in favor of things that are fun to create like rabbits.,Minecraft,cquq07p,1,t5_2r05i

3853935,0,t1_cqviai3,Hey thats some good input.  So you are saying if I understand correctly.  Do something boring if you have something to talk about so that you can just listen.  If you do something interesting talk about what you are doing or are going to do and do that on camera.  I agree I promise my viewers I wont ever show mining unless it just happens to be what I start doing when Im finishing my sentence.  I never thought about it but I guess I skip wall building too proabably because my brain registers it as boring.So here are things that can make or break a video in your opinion. Crappy mic vs. good mic.. You prefer to watch videos done in creative speed is a factor. Redstone builds something Im guessing not often seen before.. No Mining or tedious building walls Terraforming etc.. The previous is acceptable only if you are vlogging or discussing something at length and you know no one will be paying attention to the video.. If you are building in survival or something interesting then keep to the interesting parts of it and talk about the future or what you should expect to see if you want to show it being built.So this all being said.  It sounds like doing tours of your builds is preferable to lets plays.  I also seen a universal frustration with people doing adventuring since combat in Minecraft isnt particularly difficult.  In fact most of those aspects are explicitly forbidden in the posting rules.,Minecraft,cqvl1g3,1,t5_2r05i

3860560,0,t3_34lyl9,It looks good so far but my main complaint is that its so busy that you cant really see any direction. What is meant by direction is that parts of the structure should lead your eye to a particular point similar to how an artist will draw your eye to a particular place on their drawing with different curvatures and shading.Take a look at this The creator of this used an overall triangular shape and made it thinner. My eyes are naturally drawn to the center and top of the structure right to where the focus of the structure should be on the cross. My problem with your gate is that it lacks a focal point. The block work is too busy and my eyes dont know where to go. This takes away from your creation as you are obviously a very talented builder.My suggestion I guess would be to examine the works of great Minecraft builders and real life artists alike and see if you can find similar detailing as to what I just described that really takes their work above and beyond.,Minecraft,cqwc70t,1,t5_2r05i

3906091,0,t1_cr18x2x,Best Gold farm I like is the overworld farm that requires a large amount of obsidian. You can either mine the blocks with a diamond pick axe or just use lavawater to create the obsidian.Theres a good tut on YouTube for it but Im on my phone and do not remember the original creator so I cant provide source material.You build a series of nether portals at least x in size. The tut says  of them but I found great success with just .  obsidian is needed and enough blocks to close off the exits.After the portals are made and closed off link the farm to a nether portal strictly for item and xp acquisition. Make  iron golems and push them through the portal in the nether. Create a hopper system under the portal using hopper minecarts because they cN grab items that land a block above them when normal hoppers cannot.You afk in the overworld while the golems kill off pigmen. The pigmen no longer attack the iron golems since the .. update so you never need to replace the golems. All items and xp get transferred to the hopper system in the nether. The xp will sit at the nether side of the portal until you travel there and load the chunks. It may seem like a lot of work but honestly all you need to mine is the first  obsidian for your initial nether portal. Once you get to the nether you can use a lava lakes worth of buckets to easily create the portals in the overworld. Ive afkd on this during a shower meals the gym and work to supply myself and a small group of server friends with a lot of xp. Highest Ive gotten after a work day was up to level  in one xp grab. Plus gold nuggets will give you all the beacon pyramid blocks notch and golden apples powered rails and golden carrots you could possibly need. Flesh for trades as well and if you dont have a village nearby you can make a villager farm with all the golden apples you can make.,Minecraft,cr1j1nr,3,t5_2r05i

4020688,0,t3_36isz6,Piginabag are you familiar with the map Rogue by uRubisk? It seems like the work that you and Rubisk have done on your respective projects could be really complimentary and I wonder if there might be a good opportunity for the two of you to collaborate to create something better than either of your individual projects alone.In case youre unfamiliar with it heres a slightly modified description of the main distinguishing features of Rogue that I wrote for a YouTuber who I was encouraging to play itgt The map takes place in a dungeon thats randomly generated through the use of a command block system every time you play. Its completely vanilla requires no mods or plugins. Its very difficult. It starts off hard gets a little easier as you collect some resources but then increases in difficulty at a pace that outstrips your increasing strength. You only have one life. If you die you have to start all over in a newlygenerated dungeon with a different layout. Your red heart health does not naturally regenerate making potions and golden apples very important. You have a shield of two absorption hearts that does regenerate so it encourages you to risk engaging in some direct combat but punishes you if you take too much damage within a short period of time. It strongly emphasizes Survival Mode gameplay elements including resource collection crafting altering the landscape and finding creative solutions to challenges. The map features custom mobs. Normally I would consider this to be a negative because custom mobs in Minecraft are usually pretty gimmicky and add complexity to the maps that contain them without making them any more interesting or fun. In contrast each of the mob types in Rogue is cleverly designed to make the challenges they represent more interesting and varied. The mapmaker didnt take the dumb route of making them harder by making them stronger and tougher. Instead he made them harder by giving each of them interesting abilities. For example spiders in it will often place cobwebs on you when they attack immobilizing you and possibly leading to your death if there are other mobs in the area. Each combination of mobs that you can be faced with presents its own interesting combat puzzle to be solved. PvE combat is far more interesting and varied than in basic Survival Minecraft or any other Minecraft map Im aware of.So Rubisk did a very impressive job of working out a way of modifying Survival gameplay mechanics and creating a system of presenting players with challenges and resources that produces compelling gameplay but I would say that his map has a significant weakness in that the designs of the elements that it uses to build its dungeons are not very interesting. They dont look very aesthetically appealing and theres not a whole lot of variation between them at least in terms of basic layout. All the hallways connecting the rooms are narrow and essentially featureless with just some turns and height variation to vertically align to the rooms they connect to and the occasional overlappingbranching path. The rooms are all basically rectangles of approximately the same size. Some have two vertical levels a balcony a central pillar or a second floor sometimes with a prebuilt ladder or staircase leading up to it and some have water or lava hazards but apart from the random distribution of mob spawners and resources and differences in blocktype theme between levels thats about the extent of the variation.The dungeon areas that you show in the attached album are far more interesting. Theyre more aesthetically pleasing and they have more interesting shapes which could lead to a more varied and interesting gameplay experience. I imagine that a map that combined Rubisks dungeon generation system and modified Survival mechanics with your dungeon elements could be amazing.,Minecraft,crel7pn,5,t5_2r05i

At some point the gaming community is going to be people already recruited or people which have already taken a stance on whether or not to buy it. Just like any other game out there. WoW is still a very healthy game even though everybody knows about it people come and go with new patchesreleases same with Minecraft.Minecraft is a unique game. Some people like building alone some people want to build with other people. Some people dont like building at all. Some people only play to build but doesnt care about surviving. Its VERY limited what you can do this in game in terms of choices building or not build if you choose not to build the content just isnt there to satisfy someone for days. What Im trying to say is that while many people enjoy building stuff it simply cant take many peoples attention days in row while most other popular games can because they are filled with content or variable things to do.

As for copy and paste those features were present when I began using iPhone in . Having used both systems extensively I can say that Android lacks polish and suffers in terms of efficiency but it gets to run on some nice hardware.I miss my jailbroken iOS but the ultimate would be for both camps to be given full features and functionality. Also device manufacturers need to stop pissing around with undersized batteries and waterdamageable hardware.Removable batteries are irrelevant  the only reason Ive ever had to remove a battery has been the several hundred times my Android devices have had software crashes and needed a hard reboot.The SD Card is definitely a nice feature.While were at it all phones should have FM enabled and hardware support for the new Galileo GPS thats being built.,Minecraft,crvxw4d,0,t5_2r05i

The faster a mountain climbs the more different each shade will be.If you make a flat plain it will also be constant just a different shade I suppose. Someone earlier tried that and it was a constant dark green.EDIT Honestly Im glad you added that calc derivative edit. That explained it better than the other comments. The shade is simply based on slope. If its constant slope or flat the map will all be one color just a different shade depending on the slope. As long as the slope is constant at every single point. A flat plain is constant technically the slope is  at each point. ,Minecraft,cshnar7,3,t5_2r05i

4409040,0,t1_csmlu6k,I mean sure but the Lego movie had a couple of things going for it that this doesnt.For one it promised all your favorite lego sets together. This is a movie that has Batman partying with Han Solo and Chewbacca the vastness of the Lego franchises represented settings and characters is huge which was the other big draw. The movie goes through practically every major Lego setting wild west city space etc.By comparison this Telltale game will take place either in the generic fantasy overworld of Minecraft or the generic hellscape of Minecraft. It doesnt get the luxury of having Han Solo or Superman or NBA basketball teams it gets... Steve. And maybe some villagers. And the Enderdragon. None of those are characters. Not one of them have a defining feature or motivation. Even generic Lego minifigs tell you more about their personality through their faces and occupations than Steve does.I get what youre saying there is some similarity but I dont think there is nearly enough to say The Lego Movie did well so this Telltale game could to I am still heavily betting against this being anything good.,Minecraft,csmmtlg,17,t5_2r05i

4415814,0,t1_csmq20l,ok we built one part of the farm yesterday and it got pretty late. it does work with only one holding cell just fine.it took us so long because we didnt manage to start the breeding. we added one more row of doors around the farm keeping the center at the same spot threw food at them built a carrot farm as a holding cell and finally imported every single villager from the original village via minecart just to have the  villagers and see some iron golems  which worked atleast...now it looks like thisand then came the moment we realized that we continued playing a super old world and those villagers are not the current ones with professions and all but just villagers. they dont do anything...I guess they dont have an inventory like the current version.I am the admin of the server so we decided to kill all those villagers give me spawning eggs via the server console and spawn  new ones including some farmers. I feel a bit bad about this because its the first time we used some kind of cheating the iron farm still works no problem but we didnt manage to see some breeding in action yet.

If you still think you are buying a new game mode youre just dumbonce they annouced this game it was right away clear that it wasnt connected to Minecraft itself.gt kinda feels like they dont have that many ideas of their ownNo ideas of their own? They have put on some amazing stories BASED on another movies series and games. Look at the Walking Dead I like the serie but the story in the games I really loved. Sorry but I really disagree with what you are saying here. Of course peopel have different opinions but because they make their games this way and you dont like it doesnt make them bad. The episodic games works really well for them so why change it? You can really experience their games as a tv show where you are a big input.

It does break up the look but with the right color of glass it can blend in or act as a contrasthighlight.As for the pillar torches my question would be does every block of the pillar need to be bright?  Lighting just the bottom or just the top or justthebottomandtop could be a bit more dramatic than even lighting.The other strategy and it might not work for this build is to use halfslabs as your floor.

When you throw it oriented vertically one side of the boomerang gets more lift than the other because of the airfoil design of the edges so is lifted to one side and creates the turning.

Did I miss a sarcasm tag?There has been some promising progress of them caring about developers on Linux contributions to help Windows and Linux VMs work on the same hosts starting to open up .NET but I think thats a very different market and set of considerations on their part. Their attitude toward consumers on Linux cant be taken as obvious at all.If Mojang doesnt say they wont ever make PE the main version of Minecraft arent all the other platforms based on PE? It would be absurd for them to not do this or doesnt specifically say theyll add Linux support to PE Hasnt Skype gone through a rewrite that added new features that never got ported back to Linux? Thats a little better because they mostly keep compatibility and havent added any new core features really but thats not likely the situation for future Minecraft versions then Im not keeping my hopes high for the long run.,Minecraft,ctj19bs,32,t5_2r05i

The reason its almost identical to pocket edition in features is because its very new and early beta. They have said it will receive all of the features of the Java edition. It is meant to be played on all Windows  devices once its a full release and should be superior to the Java version performance wise. The one area Java may be better is modability.

4772888,0,t1_ctvk8dq,To be more clear cells going through mitosis bacteria and other single celled organisms grow their populations at an exponential rate doubling their number n over a certain amount of time.  In the lab this process often takes the whole weekend to see enough growth to be able to measure or count the change.  I would like to use Cows and Slimes to simulate this process at a much faster rate either manually by a push button or automatically on a timer.  However since I know cows breed  calf per breeding pair and I dont want to change the breeding properties of cows I would like a script that automatically breeds and grows cows naturally that I can use to make a timelapse .n growth scenario.  I would also like a slime n growth scenario since slimes can more accurately depict cell growth as their size can be altered then split into two cells again.Scenarios cows breed and produce one offspring.  On second breeding all calves are grown to adulthood giving  total cows.  Next breeding produces  offspring and again produces  more... grow the calves repeat. slime is doubled in size then split into  slimes.   slimes are doubled in size then split into  slimes etc.Additional request If you can make the command block construct a petri dish of glass blocks around the starting population that would be incredibly awesome.,Minecraft,ctw5yhb,1,t5_2r05i

4829667,0,t3_3h1230,PonyMCPoniArcade has got to be the WORST Minecraft server ive ever joined. The server seems to have a level of sins to it. . the staff is not very friendly nor very helpful. . they only have  modes Build world and survival. . Survival is like factions You cant protect anything the mode is never fun and no one listens to you when you speak. . The Build world is NOT creative. The facilities in Build are large scaled versions of Equestria. There so big you feel like throwing up because of how large they are. You wonder why the hell they would waste their time constructing the builds so enormous. and biggest of all . You will get banned for the STUPIDEST reasons. You might steal something unprotected you might cuss even though there is no filter or you might break a few blocks around the spawn point. And Get this Admins dont care if their players get griefed. they only care when THEY get griefed. thats right the admins think that they are normal players. I got banned for stealing unclaimed diamond blocks from an admins home disregarding the fact that they can change gamemode to creative and spawn more diamond blocks they banned me for breaking that admins unclaimed diamond blocks. and now that they switched servers to poniarcade for no given reason their new website doesnt have ban appeals. so if you didnt get a ban appeal back then if you want to now youre too lateit feels like they changed servers just so to do that. But why would you want to get unbanned? There is nothing but admins whining innocent players getting banned hacking campaigns and overall horribleness. would you believe they ban at least  people a day? i keep track of it. So yeah Worst Server Ever. if you have had any similar experiences on PonyMCPoniArcade tell me,Minecraft,cu3bif7,2,t5_2r05i

When you push a letter button it summons a named armor stand of that letter and stores an ID for that letter on the  cursor armor stand.  Then when a model is saved a new armor stand is summoned in the model stack at the ylevel of the model and the letter  letter variables are transferred over.For loading its the same process but in reverse  transfer letter  letter from the memory armor stand to the cursor and to  display armor stands rename the display armor stands based on their letter ID get rid of any armor stands with an id of  no letter and teleport the cursor to the end.,Minecraft,cu4s6gz,2,t5_2r05i

As the player base has grown the maturity level of players has declined noticeably IMO. Thankfully this sub is still pretty good or at least the garbage comments end up being heavily downvoted. You still have a good number of players though that are just entitled little shits who have no idea how far this game has come. I bought Minecraft while some of them were literally still wetting the bed and I havent been required to spend another dime on it in all those years. Thats a huge fucking deal. How many copies of CoD have their parents bought them in that same timeframe? BTW there have been ! major ones with another due out this November. Guess what  the game I bought years ago for  still hasnt been shelved to make way for Minecraft  Creepers Revenge or similar. Some of the same devs are still improving the same game and are still actively engaged with the community just like they have been since pretty much the first day they were hired.

Its clicking where you need to click and honestly if youre good enough you dont even click as much yet win a game.I could and believe many others could take out a person who uses autoclicker yet come out basically unscathed. Why was it possible that a skillful player at  ping could take out an unskilled player at  ping without taking damage?Theres reason.

Im a bit confused what you mean by time their w and distance for making their movement better. Ive seen in your example that you need to strafe to constantly throw off enemy aim while also making sure your mouse is centered on them yes? Why cant the person being comboed adjust his aim? Is it because he is constantly in the air or the fact the person comboing him is unpredictable? Is his positioning off? Or is he just bad at aiming?,Minecraft,cubtryp,1,t5_2r05i

4913268,0,t1_cudf50s,Yeah but you still delivered a faulty summary and were wrong about syndicate having to remove said video due to the copyright claim.Ill copy paste my findings anyway This is mostly just sloppy management and hasty actions. I dont see foul intent tbh. It hinges on Declan Who i think is a part of mianite but not a part of syndicate? who gave the others the video. He initially did not mention who made it or the  split but did send them the creators youtube link a few hours later. Source TheSyndicateProject has claimed his initial video as under his copyright and plans to donate the revenue towards the ALSMND Foundation. Source  TheSyndicateProject removed the video in august though it is not clear at what day specifically. Source is the link above MakBotOfficial claims he did file a copyright on th of july but that it failed. Source TheSyndicates account backs this up by saying it was struck with a strike immediately. Source  The discussion between Declan and Makbot is alleged to have been a verbal agreement according to MakbotOfficial. source Syndicate is claiming they commissioned makbot for his work but cannot provide proof of that either. Source Tom One of the Syndicate members is now refusing to continue discussing this matter in a text based form. SourceampnbspampnbspTLDRDeclan gave the video to the others he failed to mention who made it or how revenue should be handled.TheSyndicate took said video and monetized and it which requires claiming it as his own or under fair use. He got a copyright strike for doing so and rightfully so.There might or might not have been agreements either way they werent recorded. Moral of the story always record or document a important agreement.Admittedly talking things out before filing a copyright strike would be preferable imo.

Most of your good stuff should be in the ender chest anyway.Short of that Id set up a nether portal in each base.  The distance relative to the over world in the nether is .  that is to say that you travel  blocks in the normal world for each block traveled in the nether.Use F to find you location in your new base in the normal world where you want the portal.  Go to the nether and build a portal at those coordinates divided by .  Example normal XYZ       Nether .Know that you can build two sets of portals to make transport faster. I use this method to explore the world.  I put up portals in the nether every  blocks in each directions forming a grid.  this gets me portals on the normal land every  blocks or so apart.,Minecraft,cueduxo,3,t5_2r05i

The cap increases the bigger your view distance but stops increasing at only  chunks so most people these days have way too much land loaded for the cap to work correctly. So the total amount of animals in loaded areas almost never drops low enough for respawns.But by making the whole landscape grassfree except for  spot for a large distance and killing all local animals you can get everything focused on that one place. The fact that the underground isnt valid makes it easier to do than with a hostile mob farm.,Minecraft,cueoxe1,14,t5_2r05i

Those are an easy fix every so often gracefully shut the server down and restart it.If youre going to setup a backup schedule and you are right? because a power glitch could crash your server and corrupt your data files then youll want to configure how many backups to keep either by time or size.  Many people setup backups that only keep one copy but if the data files get a corruption then the next time the backup runs it will be corrupted so it is often best to keep a few backups spaced out over a period of time.

4948168,0,t1_cuhdvs9,Okay so theres no way to do that but I figured out how its supposed to work and doesnt.Conditional or unpowered chain blocks do always continue the chain signal. If they dont execute because they werent powered or the condition failed they evaluate as a failed command for the next block in the Conditional chain. The way this should be then isimpulse  blockdata  autobuncond  testfor somethingcond  say true statement cond  say true statement cond  blockdata  autobuncond needs RS  say false statement cond   say false statement uncond  say always executesFalse statement  should be unpowered and therefore fail and cause false  not execute if the True branch executes and it should be powered and therefore execute if the True branch doesnt. So far all this is correct...... but the conditional depending on the first False statement isnt correctly being evaluated by the engine its always being executed. Youll see the first false statement correctly doesnt execute but the others do. If you built this chain as I just described it execute the chain when the condition is false which works then execute it when the condition is true and youll see false statement  incorrectly executes. To demonstrate this is a bug edit the false  block click the Needs Redstone button twice to not actually do anything then execute the chain when the condition is true. Itll work  try false works  try true again and bug!I also tried doing this the classical way by replacing the blockdata commands with setblock .. redstoneblockair and got the same result. This is a bug with the Conditional block evaluation.But it will be possible!,Minecraft,cui99br,1,t5_2r05i

4955505,0,t3_3is1me,I didnt read the whole thing or even the TLDR but here is my take.  Im not getting bored with the game however every game with a great mod community essentially makes this scenario.Right now they need to work on gameplay and mechanics and a modding API as well as better engine optimization.At this point the realization is simply this...  Mods do it better than they ever could.  I feel like the new arrows are dumb for them to make.  Its been done.  I mean just the staple mods take the game and put it on steroids.I will always like things like new dimensions but really all the end changes are just boo at this point.  Why?  Well... Its been done...  And done BETTER!  Re spawning the end dragon...   All of it...   Done already.They just need to work on expanding what the game can do and find ways to optimize code better and building a REAL mod API.THATs why the . hype feels numb on me.  ...well that and the fact that most of the modpacks and individual mods will take forever to move to ..If you feel stale with Minecraft go pick up any of the great modpacks on ATLauncher or FTB Launcher and do something new.  Challenge yourself with new challenges.  Right now MadPack  is in beta there are packs like SkyFactory and some hardcore hard ones like well madpack journey to the core.  You can always work on optimizations in those as well as getting faster etc.The game is great but mods are where it shines and they need to just open the gates properly.,Minecraft,cuj6jwu,49,t5_2r05i

It would be pretty fast even for thousands entries.Yeah I mention a tree map which is the closest java gets to a hash Im assuming Hash table is what would be referred to in perl as just a hash but while the access speed is mostly constant  the implementations Ive seen do lose speed as size increases but for modern computers it takes a truly monumental size to actually affect it I was more concerned about the overall memory space it would take. gt I have been heavily programming for a few years as my career choice.Ive been programming for quite some time longer than the past week I just meant Ive been doing it excessively the past week most of my free time has been spent with my head buried in code with occasional breaks for reddit or other internet socialization so Ive been in constant codemode.And my assumptions about the code base are based primarily on inferences about the underlying code based on behavior with a very minor amount of poking around.  And at this point Im just rather enjoying the theoretical discussion about code that I have minimal knowledge on the exact details. I actually find it a rather useful exercise in reference to my own coding and deciphering the code of others the more practice I get trying to infer what the code looks like from behavior the easier it is to navigate an unfamiliar codebase which may be my own if Ive programmed late into the night past when my commenting ability has went to sleep.,Minecraft,curx7d7,1,t5_2r05i

The firewall is fairly easy to test simply by turning it off temporarily and seeing if it it works.

You got the beta client plus you got the full version plus continual client updates that have added content and improved the game. You got mods. You got however many hours of play youve sunk into it. You got however many friends you got out of playing mutliplayer if youve done that. In short youve gotten a ton of shit for way less than what the game eventually cost for those who didnt get in on things when it was cheaper. If you still think you got screwed maybe the problem isnt that you didnt get what you paid for.

For shaders use  as the base and then pretty much any shaders recommended there. It might be a bit much to start installing and making sure that it doesnt crash the game which it will if you got wrong versions andor settings so for now I wouldnt worry about it. Just install Optifine and Zyins for now think you might need Forge for easy installation for those read more about Forge here  download it here  One thing to notice here is that none of these will work with the . snapshots. Mods always drag behind so youll be playing with . until they get the . updates.

Not interested in that changing either.Also I did not remember rabbit meat was in the game at the time of that comment which is why I thought of the rabbit foot which definitely could be a balance issue being the Jump Boost potion ingredient. Another commenter suggested the pelt could be it,Minecraft,cwu7c96,-2,t5_2r05i
5626965,0,t3_3s61cl,My friend and I have tried building slime farms several times always being mindful of the things already mentioned in the comments using slime finder for the correct chunks using jackolanterns being below a certain block depth etc.. For some reason weve had very limited success. We found an alternative that worked for us but that may or may not be what youre looking for. Since slimes will also spawn in swamps I simply found a large swamp cleared it of any trees and filled in any ponds with dirt. The bigger the area the better. Then you wait until its a full moon swamp slime spawns are affected by the phases of the moon and go slime hunting. On two consecutive nights one full moon and one gibbous moon I collected about  slimes.I am aware that its more dangerous than other methods as you have to kill the slimes while also having to dealwith all the other mobs that spawn. The rates might also not be as good as what youve seen in other methods. However I didnt see this in the comments anywhere and so I just wanted to give you a back up if all else failed. Good luck! ,Minecraft,cwukucp,4,t5_2r05i

5650108,0,t1_cwwy89b,Well thats just it right?People say Id rather have it later than buggy but it never works out that way. Im not just talking about MC. To be clear Im saying this as a matter of fact. Im not saying Mojang isnt doing what they can. It will be a long time still before this game is bug free. Not to mention every new update brings new bugs anyway. Ive been through updates that took months and months. Hell . took quite a while too heard the rather have it bug free and here we are.Obviously there will be less bugs than there would have been but the whole more timeless bugs is pretty arbitrary when it comes to the players perspective. Im not agreeing with anyone who says it should have been released by now either. Its not released yet because its just not done in their eyes. It doesnt need to be any more complicated than that.I just dont expect the length of time to equate to a bug free game. ,Minecraft,cwxg8mn,2,t5_2r05i

5785823,0,t3_3ucyy1,Its not harder so much as it is more skillbased.What I mean by that is if you dont haveuse much skill youll have a worse time post. since spamming was nerfed into oblivion as others have mentioned not as bad as some people say though you can deal full damage with an attack every . seconds with swords instead of every . seconds and the player is somewhat less tanky i.e. you cant shrug off hits until you have diamond armor instead of iron.If you do have skill though its much harder to die than before. Keep in mind that your melee range and mobility are much greater than that of monsters as long as you dont back yourself into a corner and even then you need to be swarmed you can always hover just outside a mobs melee range and murder them with no damage to yourself with groups you just pick them off one hit at a time. Theyre harder yes but still very very easy to kill with no threat to yourself. However players now have tools to deal with mobs that you were pretty much forced to take damage from pre.. Skeletons are utterly stumped by shields now whereas before you had to put up with the spam and regeneration from food was buffed so much that you can actually outheal DoTs this turns DoT mobs from armorpiercing nightmares by MC standards anyway into another joke.If you used to fight creepers by sprinthitting and then backing up then treat every melee mob in the snapshots as if they were a creeper sprinting optional though it helps for groups. Dont get closer than you have to. Shield against skeleton arrows shove food down your throat if you get hit by a DoT. Thats the new combat system in a nutshell only the Enderdragon requires better tactics probably never tried the new fight.,Minecraft,cxeabpu,1,t5_2r05i

Even then after  weeks or so youd need to look things up theres some stuff youll never figure out for yourself.On the other hand if youd rather have it explained for you!!!SPOILER WARNING!!! If you havent discovered it yet theres a x crafting grid in the inventory. Put a log in it and a pile of  planks will appear in the result box. Take that and fill up the x crafting grid to get a crafting table a block with a x crafting grid in it. Most stuff requires the x grid to craft. You can make sticks from planks by putting  planks in  above the other  planks makes  sticks. A pickaxe is  sticks middle slot on the bottom row and middle on the middle row then either planks cobblestone iron gold or diamonds in the top  slots. Sword is  stick in the bottom middle and  of one of those  types of material in the other middle slots. Crafting recipes can be looked up here    you need a wooden pickaxe or better to mine stone you need stone or better to mine iron you need iron or better to mine gold and diamond you need diamond to mine obsidian made when water touches lava source blocks.   Using the right tool for the job makes it go faster. Using the wrong tool makes it lose double the durability.   Diamonds can be found at the bottom of the world heights . Height  is the best place to start making tunnels.   Monsters spawn in darkness. Make sure to keep things lit up. Every  blocks if its an open space or every  blocks if its a  block wide tunnel.   They say dont dig straight up because you might get buried by gravel or sand or find a lava pocket and dont dig straight down you might fall into a cavern or once again lava. However you can safely dig down by standing on the border between  blocks. Dig down one side as far as you can look to make sure theres a solid block down there dig the other side if there is. Bring along ladders and you can even get back up the same way.  logs is more than enough for a stack of ladders.   Watch out for the killer laser fish! ,Minecraft,cy47ayh,5,t5_2r05i

Weird texture for an indestructible block. I dont like the inconsistancies with the polished stone variants.  the granite and diorite look like the unpolished versions but the andesite looks like the vanilla texture.  Just deciding on one or the other would be nice. On a similar note it would be nice if the stone variants looked a bit more like regular stone but thats just me.Other than that looks great.

Think of a way to abuse random features.If you do you can build a huge and fast mob farm without a lot of effort Ronnygobooms version is what made me think of itAlso there are other ways of getting xp. Like fishing. You can download the autofish mod most servers dont list it as cheating and if youre in a boat over deep ocean you can live as long as mobsplayers dont get to you even with mcmmo traps. The poison hits you but cant kill you and the tnt hits your boat and falls down far enough where you take no damage.Finally some servers sell xp bottles if this is the case look for economy abuse. If cactus sells for a lot that might be a great indirect xp grinder.However theres a good chance you can sell enderpearls for a ton of money and enderman give you loads of xp so if you dont have craftbook its probably the best option.,Minecraft,cyp4e73,2,t5_2r05i

6160689,1,t1_cypudxx,gt Fine lets shred your stupid comment apartPlease can we be civil here?gt As you can see reading this thread most people agree with me.Which goes back to my point about rminecraft being largely antiserver. Youre preaching exactly what they want to hear here. That doesnt make you false but it is something to be aware of.gt Its great if a servers player base enjoys the server they are on. What I am trying to point out is that huge player bases are left without a server because there arent servers that are suitable for them. This isnt me being a snob this is me pointing out that somebody could fill this gap and scoop up some players by doing that.In that case you shouldve titled this What Id want in a server not What servers do wrong. And dont bring up that opinion BS again. Its an opinion whether you put it in the title or not.gt Seems like your comments purpose was to discourage me or others making posts like this for some reason.gt Also you had the need to tell me that my opinions dont ultimately matter at all.You voiced your opinion I voiced mine. My comment had nothing to do with discouraging these posts.

6400097,0,t1_czgup5t,Ah yes. The math does assume everything is frame perfect which by all means is never going to be the case. I can answer a few of your points though.You are completely right about halving your DPS if you end up attacking at . seconds instead of right at the end of the iframes. So lets say you aim for timing your attacks at . seconds with a margin of error at  . seconds ensuring you never accidentally attack during the iframes. My calculations show youll still be gaining an average DPS of  rough calculation with swords  with Iron Axes and  with Diamond Axes over PT hits.The visual indicator for timing your swings at . seconds is when the enemy stops being red from the iframes which IMO is easier to see than either of the combat bars currently in the game. This is not taking into account the human factor of reaction time. If you wait to see that the enemy is no longer red the reaction time will dictate that youre still doing more DPS than waiting for the combat bar to fill all the way.I also understand what you mean with the wasted damage. It IS better to take  PT Diamond Sword swings at an unarmored playerzombieskeleton  health than  TS swings. It is something that should be taken into account on a case by case basis as of now. Im not sure if Ill ever get around to doing to full formulas for optimal dmg calculations. Dont forget that the first swing will also do the full damage. With this in mind the quickest way to kill a  health enemy with a Diamond Sword is in . seconds with a . delay between attacks. ..  . The Stone Iron and Diamond Axes are still better at . seconds with TS though. PAs I said before I dont think Im going to calculate the armor values but I may do the enchantments. I would just need more info on how their damage is calculated with the new combat system.,Minecraft,czh4j7v,1,t5_2r05i

I like SEUS for the awesome nighttime effects where the entire game is in black and white except for near light sources just like in real night time but the lag can be really unbearable using it. Sildurs I find really doesnt have as much lag for me but does not have the same black and white night effects. To tell the difference run each one and go through a full minecraft day and night. Youll see the difference then. Also do it in creative so you can see what things like torches and other blocks may look like.

6731624,0,t3_47tvxx,Sethbling made the game Super Craft Bros as a vanilla minigame with command blocks. It also lacks a lot of features you describe. The game youre playing Im guessing on mineplex is called something else. I cant remember what I think it has a few more syllables. That game is on a server and it uses plugins to allow for loss of special effects nort possible in vanilla like mob disguises special projectiles and double jumps. With the new . command blocks and player heads you can probably achieve a decent version of your yogscast version. I assume you dont know java plugin programming else you wouldnt ask this question. So because you cant make plugins you can take the easier route using vanilla. With vanilla you wont be able to do some cool things like being able to change a players skin have a custom skin NPC tracking their movement. However you can still use texture packs and player heads. Double jumps are totally possible but not quite as smooth.

I started playing a bit after that I built this small base in a tiny cave it was more like an indent in the hill then shortly after I died. as I kept looking for the cave I came across an even bigger cave it when down to the bedrock layers later on about the time when I was in the Nether stage i was digging out the ceiling of one of the caverns that branched off of the one that became my new home to make room for my portal then I ended up digging up the floor of my old home which I hadnt found until that moment...

6776658,0,t3_48kjr5,Well optifine. For a more heavy clientside mod I thinks its hard to decide between one of the awesome structurebiome mods especially one that adds more stuff to oceans or a nerfed version of carpenters blocks. The three things I really want in the game is better command blocks better oceanscavesstructures and the ability to do stuff like place slabs and stairs vertically. For command blocks I basically just want to program but I understand why the devs wont add that. Im very happy with the . additions with the exception of the r and dxdydz arguments. I dont know if theyre fixed but the version I used a few snapshots ago was terrible.For structuresoceanscaves I just feel like there is such an empty space there waiting for more cool details. The cave biome structure mod or something like that does a lot of things right in this regard. I also have to say the Dynamo vanilla seed specific structures command block add on adds so much to the gameplay experience. We need more dungeons like the water temple and end cities. For oceans anything that just makes them more lifelike. Fish kelp forests predators reefs it all helps. For more block options I would love things like vertical slabs sideways fence posts smaller rounded versions of logs more versions of pillars that dont fill the grid. ,Minecraft,d0kf1wz,18,t5_2r05i

I actually rounded up all of the materials for it but I invited others on for the fight. I was the only Op on at the time. Based on someones suggestion we spawned the Wither in just a terrible spot and it was on Hard difficult and ended up being a much larger battle than I anticipated. After about  minutes of us dying running back and dying again I turned the difficulty down to easy because I just wanted to see the thing dead already. Another  minutes that thing keeps moving away from the original location. So I started to pop in and out of spectator mode just to find where the Wither was. It was a little over an hour of just pure chaos the ender dragon was trivial in comparison we finally killed him. Two of the people who were regulars stopped logging in after that  I cant help but think that they considered what I was doing lowering the difficulty and popping inandout of spectator in order to make tracking faster as cheating.,Minecraft,d0shshr,27,t5_2r05i

6858305,0,t3_49oucp,Mining for iron always annoys me. Irons uses are too numerous for the way the ore spawns. By the time I get a decent amount of iron I have entirely too much redstone and gold and everything else. Ive never felt the need for something like an Iron Titan though those are firmly in the realm of serverlevel infrastructure and one person would be hardpressed to use that much iron. Then again on servers you might want to stay close to other players and not load out too much map so mining for iron can become problematic.But for food Ive never really cared. I like to make wheat fields because they look nice and any reasonably sized wheat field for aesthetics is far more wheat than one player would ever need. Chicken and cow machines are kind of fun but not terribly necessary. I make some farms just because I like the industrial revolution vibe minecraft gives me and dont care about the resources just the atmosphere.Wood is silly though Mumbo has a nice video on this Most of the automated designs arent really that much faster.Farms for mob drops all day though. Fighting is great but the quantities for anything useful are just grindy.I think automation really shines on servers though. Its impractical to have everyone nearby and mining. Large collaborative projects might need impractical amounts of pumpkins or leather or something that you dont wanna sit around and wait for the traditional methods. Then again servers often have lessthanvanilla ways of transmuting items.And a small sidenote Farms make a good redstone training thing. Most designs are wellestablished and documented so you can learn how to make all the little dodads. If you wanna make doors and popup crafting tables and all those other things design changes on context a lot and its not always easy to find good resources. But making a few standardized farms can help you learn about monostable circuits and hopper clocks and mechanical things like that. Secret doors often involve BUD switches and pumpkin farms are a good way to learn how that mechanic works. And the efficiencydriven farm community is who discovers a lot of the cool mechanics.,Minecraft,d0tp4p9,6,t5_2r05i

Also wouldnt you say that a click resulting in nothing is sort of a penalty? I get what you mean about not wanting it as default. Maybe they did it that way because so many people where complaining about attacks not doing damage.I dont really have a desireneed for anything other than a full attack I only play in SSP so timing is a chore anyways so Im glad this is a thing. However think of it this way if youre in SMP against an opponent with weak attacks disabled you can choose to attack faster for less damage if you want to knock them off of a cliff or into lava or something whereas they would only be able to do full attacks.

If youre stuck with vanilla then its never going to be super convenient though there are two shortcuts that make it a lot easier to work with.The first is using the tilde  in place of any specific coordinate this will put in your X Y or Z coordinate as appropriate.  You can also have a number positive or negative next to it in order to offset it by that amount.  fill       stone would create a stone cube around you going out  blocks in all directions for example and that works in any spot you put in coordinates for a command.You can also use your tab key to fill in the coordinate spaces which is about as close as we get to selecting an area with a tool like in WorldEdit.  Just place a block in the spot you want to get the coordinates to setblock    stone is really convenient for doing this in the air by the way mouse over it and then in each of the X Y and Z spots press tab and it will fill in the coordinates of that block.Unfortunately thats about as easy as it is going to get with vanilla.

Youll need to place a glass block on both sides of the burning netherrack so you dont light the whole place up but its super consistent. Also if you place your setup with one block of walking space you can just run down the aisle whacking all your crops and then run back and pick them up... its super fast and easy.If you feel that method requires a bit too much work to harvest you could get creative and build your own water harvesting system.,Minecraft,d290sv7,1,t5_2r05i

In total that adds up to  blocks. If you can place roughly  blocks of sand per second that means you have to spend almost  minutes of just placing blocks before all that space is covered. Compare to what I did and you need to place a total of  blocks of sand to make an enclosed space and then  blocks for the remover adding up to  blocks. If we can place these blocks at the same rate it means we more than cut the time in half having only to spend about  minutes of placing blocks.

7442177,0,t3_4h7c39,gtMoney is no issue for me. If I have to pay for it most of the costs for an entire year thats fine.As I understand it this is why noncompliant servers are complaining  to them money is an issue. Either the costs of running the server are far above what they expect to see in donations should they adhere to the EULA or they dont have the personal money to support the server themselves. Therefore theyd be forced to shut down.Of course this isnt a problem for huge servers like Hypixel or Wynncraft most of whom are following the EULA anyways because they have a large enough player base that the small number who donate are enough to support the server. But the medium and small servers who dont have that player base theoretically wouldnt be able to support themselves with so few donating players. Therefore EULA enforcement would kill almost all small to medium sized servers who rely on donations to support themselves vastly reducing the number of servers to play on. As players loose server diversity they apparently loose interest causing enough players to quit that minecraft shrinks in size eventually causing the death of minecraft through lack of players. At least thats what they claim  how many servers rely on nonEULA compliant donations is unknown and even if most did I doubt EULA enforcement would cause so many servers to collapse THEN causing so many players to suddenly give up the game that minecraft dies. The cause and effect chain is too long and relies on too many assumptions Players dont buy EULA complacent perks but how many wouldnt? gt Servers cant support themselves but how many are noncompliant and rely on that noncompliancy in the first place?  gt Many servers shut down but how many would be unwilling to support the server with their own money? gt Players get bored with less servers but whats wrong with the large servers? Even if small servers have some unique quality theres no reason larger servers couldnt support those needs especially if they see a sudden increase in players because smaller servers shut down gt Players leave the game but whats wrong with the bigger servers modded minecraft maps or even SSP? gt Enough players leave Microsoft pulls the plug and stops updating but how can we know so many players leave it kills the game?. For every link in that chain massive uncertainties are introduced that invalidate any conclusion one attempts to make.Personally if you support your server by exploiting kids that have stolen their parents credit cards and get them to spend upwards of  which is where the majority of donations come from I dont think you should be running a server. But if youre wondering where these server owners are coming from thats their logic as I understand it.As for your own server it looks great especially if youre willing to support it with your own money! If the server owner is willing to support a server out of their own pocket it would theoretically never die and there would be no push to get as much donations as possible preventing any need for EULA violations. The way you distribute donations is unique but thats not a bad thing most servers that operate with the owners money put ALL donations to running the server with any overflow saved for future costs but your method gives plugin creators a thank you they definitely deserve.,Minecraft,d2o4mh1,8,t5_2r05i

7476708,0,t3_4hredz,This is all new to me and it seems like you care about this and have interest in it. It all does sound very interesting and also a legitimate concern the way you laid it out. Its not something Ive ever thought about. I give out a lot of personal information and blindly trust the party I give it to to keep it safe and thats basically all I have control over.Why would having information being secured in this way not be common enough of a thing for mojang to not use this method? Is there a draw back? How would a company go about moving from encrypted to having everything salt hashed?I just send my debit card information out and hope it doesnt stick in a bad spot but thats my food roof and all of it hanging on whatever the other party is using I guess.,Minecraft,d2s24qh,0,t5_2r05i

Survival didnt do it for me anymore and I had other multiplayer games I wanted to play. But a few months back I started playing again. Although slowly Im really enjoying survival again.

This is usually inside a solid wall which youll have to dig out. The game shifts the location of the destination portal rather than digging out hollow spots. But if a nether side destination portal is more than  blocks away from the correct spot it cant connect to the portal that created it because its more than  blocks away overworldside.Oh and ALWAYS make sure you have a source of fire handy BEFORE beginning work on deconstructing the portal.

7714541,0,t3_4kwtsp,I quit playing all servers after one of them banned me for hacking in hide and seek. When I asked they show me a screenshot of my location reply in a extremely condescending tone refuse to even look into a revoke. All I did was climbing on top of a tree. Not the parkour climbing that was not intended by map designer. It was a well staircased even with a wood log as starting point takes no more than simple jumping.  One of my friend also got banned for reaching a roof  that is reached by ladder from a hidden door left by designer.  And whats more theres no rule stating you cant parkour.  It is a fairly famous server with k people online regularly  years ago.  Even they do not have much interest in maintaining a fair environment. But thats what I care most about in gaming.  I dont need absolute fairness but I need to see they care and they tried.  I feel they just want to demonstrate their authority not to maintain and manage.  Its like a paradox in minecraft server. Big servers need money to run thus often money thirsty and overlook fairness small servers have limited capacity and hard to get in to. So I play LAN game with my friends after that.  The problem is the host skin not displaying bug has been around for  years and I am the host.  Recently I persuaded my roommate to join and now hes the plain dull Steve.

For instance on the network Im staff on we have a single billboard well its in more than one server but thats not the point which has the Logitech logo on it... does that hurt anyone? In fact it helps by promoting the network and the players are HAPPIER because we give away Logitech stuff.While I feel that the whole EULACommercial Use Guidelines change a couple years back was justified it did hurt the ability to monetize serversmake money. This effectively kills a large potential portion of income for servers in my opinion...Servers are very restricted in monetization its becoming harder to get repeat players to purchase items as time goes on and Mojang still tries to restrict it...,Minecraft,d3qg4ek,14,t5_2r05i

7782743,0,t1_d3qir2f,I think they can be classed as a TV show why not? One scenario is that there used to be a bunch of gaming channels on broadcast TV if a Minecraft lets play series was broadcasted exactly the same as it is on YouTube would it then become a TV show?Why cant they be classed as a TV show any more than something like House of Cards or many online exclusive shows? They both have a story and stars and a set and whatever.Millions of people also tune in to YouTube to check out the next episode of whatever Minecraft or whatever series theyre into at the moment just like with standard TV too. Both can also make a huge amount of money too.To me after typing that I think they can definitely be classed as TV shows i cant see why not.So yeah things like this definitely will definitely make the rules a bit vague and I can see some people breaking the rules according to Mojang but then others doing arguably the exact same thing will be allowed by Mojang. Doesnt sound like itll be too fair. It sounds more like a Mojang rule than Microsoft which is a weird thing.,Minecraft,d3qu01t,6,t5_2r05i

Most castles were built rebuilt and extended over hundreds of years with each architect making their own decisions. For this reason its not really possible to just have floor slabs which run through the whole building. For example grandiose rooms such as halls and naves could be ten metres or more while servant spaces might be short of two. As a general minecraft rule two blocks is a low ceiljng and feels very tight. Use it for spaces which would not feel as magnificent to walk through. Four on the other hand suggests luxury and spaciousness. This might be certain spaces for entertaining etc.,Minecraft,d3ww6ye,1,t5_2r05i

7924544,0,t1_d46lxrm,I think the point that uwanderingstar may have been making is that something really precious that Minecraft has right now and we need to protect is this incredible open space it provides where openended innovation can occur.The complex and often nonintuitive ways that blocks interact with each other are an essential part of that. Its always the places where players are using game mechanics in ways that the developers never could have foreseen that most exciting developments are made that push the frontier of innovation in the game forward. When you do something like remove quasiconnectivity and replace it with an observer block you take away at least a bit of that complexity from the system of how blocks interact with each other and reduce the size of that space in which openended innovation can occur.gtBasically mechanics should be easy to learn but hard to masterSure thats obviously a good principle of game design in general but I would caution you to not look too much to the established body of game design theory when working on Minecraft because in some fundamental ways Minecraft is unlike every other game. gtStarcraft or The Witness or Factorio or Snakebird or FTL or Civilization or Advance Wars or...One difference between Minecraft and all of those games is that in all of those games the developers planned out a specific welldefined experience for the player to have and tailored everything to facilitate players having that experience. To some degree Minecraft pushes players toward having some specific experiences as well establishing your first shelter caving your first boss battles etc... but its exceptional in the incredible degree to which it just gives players the tools to create their own experiences rather than handfeeding them what the developers came up with.One of the keys to that whole thing working is the complex set of ways in which blocks and entities etc... interact with each other. Theres so much going on in that complex system of interaction that it creates a vast and compelling possibility space for us to explore and innovate in.Observer blocks are great but taking away quasiconnectivity unambiguously takes away some of that complexity from the system of how everything in the game interacts with everything else reducing the size of the possibility space and killing part of what makes Minecraft special.gtQC isnt easy to learn it isnt hard to master either its just a bunch of magic to get right to have it work...The same could be said of crafting in the PC version of the game since we have no ingame guide to crafting recipes. But Minecraft was clearly a great game before crafting was made more accessible in the other versions. Not because not having an ingame crafting guide made it great but rather because the brilliant underlying design of the game made our not having an ingame crafting guide not a problem. It wasnt a problem because unlike other games it wasnt important for players to have any particular experience while playing Minecraft. If you didnt know how to craft a sword that didnt make the game less fun or cause you to miss out on anything important. Just exploring and messing around in the possibility space was compelling.So when you look at something like quasiconnectivity I encourage you to not think thats bad design but instead think thats exactly the sort of nonobvious result from complex systems interacting with each other that makes Minecraft the incredibly compelling tool for creative expression that it is. ,Minecraft,d46sla6,12,t5_2r05i

I kind of went backward from your path and started out as a filmmaker and then found Minecraft but I actually started out in film as a modelmaker  building miniatures for movies like Titanic The Fifth Element etc..  I am still horrid at math and technical stuff like redstone but Minecraft has created a drive in me to learn more about that stuff so I can do more inventingcreating rather than just imitatingcopying.  I think the coolest thing in your story is how Minecraft eventually got you into a whole nother interest in life outside of the virtual world  and as a filmmaker I think you couldnt have happened upon a better area than technical storytelling!

Add more memory if you use large resource packs or mods.Install Optifine You can tweak more settings with this and it includes some optimizations.Make sure VBOs are enabled in your graphics options.Check background processes to see if anything is eating your CPU cycles or memory. ,Minecraft,d4beyt4,2,t5_2r05i

8134681,1,t1_d4u8xzm,You can point out that this competitiveness doesnt lead anywhere. Relentlessly crushing a six year old over and over is nothing to brag about even for an eight year old and on top of that if he continues to behave like that hell just lose his only playmate.The younger one wont rely on his older brother for company forever hell make his own friends and if theyre not jerks hell obviously prefer them over his brother  which might lead to some ugly scenarios. Ive seen the same story go on with my cousins. Older one is  the other is  the other is  so hes irrelevant.The parents my uncle and aunt treat the older one more like a racing dog than a son they just want him to excel at everything so they can show him off and then once thats done hes expected to shut up and stay out of sight until they need him.  So hes developed the special snowflake syndrome where he is lonely but arrogant and extremely competitive to downright petty levels. He keeps shaming and insulting his younger brother who is hyperactive and likes to draw attention and he likes to compete against him so he can repeatedly crush him.However as they get older the younger one just doesnt care about it anymore he just plays alone or with his friends and the older one is suddenly left alone. He yearns for company and tries to join them but they understand he needs their approval so they reject him. The younger one then proceeds to rub it in his face as a form of revenge for all the years of getting bossed around. The older one then explodes.  And that happens on a dailyweekly basis which is why me and my brother hes  hate to be around them. The older one is usually either extremely cringeworthy or just tryharding to impress me while simultaneously trying to shoo his younger brother away and he ends up trying to get our attention by being annoying or violent.Me and my brother on the other hand just live and let live we were never extremely close but when we play together I make sure we are both having fun else one of us ragequits and thats not our goal. We play Minecraft too and most of the times I just make a world put us in enemy teams give us both access to cheats and we go crazy at each other.  We both die  times the world ends up in ruins but our faces hurt from laughing so much. And were both very competitive guys  we just know how to play along.  Its even better when we coop especially in games we dont know shit about. PMaybe they should try being on the same team against others so they can try to learn to work together? Playing against friends requires a great deal of working with them to keep the deal fun for everyone. Put them both in the same team and set the game to Hard  or even Hardcore. Theyll get crushed but they will learn to rely on each other and the older one will be forced to teach the younger one how to do stuff else hell keep dying.,Minecraft,d4ueu3p,2,t5_2r05i

8213821,0,t1_d53k92n,I dont use XP farms but theres plenty of reasons to have one. If youre only doing a level  enchant on weaponsarmor you dont really need an XP farm but if youre working on making a perfect set of armor a lot of the time its easier to enchant books so that you dont end up with enchants that you dont want. When combining books with other books or adding them to armor you can eat through levels very quickly. Another reason for having an XP farm is mending. While your sword bow and fishing rod and maybe a pickaxe without silk touch and a regular axe might get XP from just being used your other tools wont. You cant get any XP drops from using your shovel. You cant get any XP drops from using your hoe. You cant get any XP drops if youre using a silk touch pickaxe. With an XP farm you can quickly repair your toolsarmor.,Minecraft,d54a60l,1,t5_2r05i

This is what Im talking about  www.youtube.comwatch?vekBOONQ  I know with the burst you have to wait for them to finish burning which I guess could be annoying.The other question I have is related to where you say how many repeaters you need is based on difficulty.  I did some searching a while back because I was building a server for my nephews to play with me and they are pretty young so I wanted it on Easy.  I wanted to know what the differences in difficulty were and as far as mobs were concerned the only thing I could find was they do more damage in harder difficulty.  After playing there for a while it does seem they still take the same amount of hits to kill  but am I wrong about that?,Minecraft,d6cjro8,2,t5_2r05i

Unless of course theyve already done that when W edition was introduced which is possible.Issues still happen to me on commonly on Arch but that may be because of my AUR helper Pacaur andor the AUR packages themselves. Possibly the most annoying thing is symlinks being broken with BlenderKrita just about every update Python library I think requiring me to either fix the symlink or simply reinstall BlenderKrita. Ive had issues where dependencies could not be sated or there was some other issue that Pacaur wouldnt even list explicitly. Though most issues eventually resolve themselves in later updates.Im sure there are better package managers and helpers out there but that doesnt mean everyone is running them. Id sure love a better helper on Arch Pacaur or even Pacman itself doesnt uninstall dependencies that were installed with that package and are no longer needed its possible but more complicated than sudo aptget autoremove.I mean all Im trying to say is that even if they do the perfect move its still likely to not be as smooth with Linux as the Java version is simply because Java is multiplatform out of the box.

The team is too small to make an API and continue to add new featuresbugfixes.  Mojang iswas a billion dollar company with DAILY sales of  million.  The only bottleneck was manpower.Two years ago everyone said mods for MCPE would be impossible.  Java makes modding easy.  People said compiled C applications cannot be modded.  Yet now just two years after Microsoft buying them an API is coming to MCPE.

8681443,0,t1_d6qcj9q,gt Pokemon Go is also an extremely simple game which is much less processor intensive than minecraft.This is not true. This is the same misconception I hear from people not able to play the PC version of Minecraft because of hardware. Carrying the hefty Unity engine there is a lot more memory and computational power required to run the game than you think. We can think about the map loading similarly. When Pokemon Go runs it like Google maps will send a request for map data. This request is designed to be as small as possible with the expectation that the client will do the heavy work that way the requests consume little mobile data constructing everything into D and drawing out the roads and what not something your typical Google Maps would do. When MCPE loads its world it has everything locally available to it and so it can consume CPU cycles to render out the world lets assume the largest possible distance in PE  chunks IIRC this may have changed. The CPU consumption will be relatively the same across both of these with the only large differences being disk IO and memory usage. When the map data is loaded Pokemon Go does a lot of work behindthescenes much like PE. In PE youd load up all the entities and things along that nature. In addition to this Pokemon Go access hardware significantly more than PE does. It checks the accelerometer pedometer and GPS numerous times a second. This is comparable to PE ticking  entities at once. The amount of CPU cycles used pinging hardware can be pretty costly which is why optimizations are available on Android for GPS access. This is why people complain about their phones dying so frequently like PE usage as if there was a resource leak which there isnt.PE is heavily optimized to the point where it doesnt need to render things that the player isnt looking at. A lot of these optimizations have been ported over to the Java version namely block culling.gt In that case minecraft should ditch support for lowend computers as well and only work with gtx X cards and higher hyperbole intended and all phones. Of course you have to support older hardware but the older pc hardware that needs to be supported will still be more powerful than your older phone hardware....what? If your phone cannot run Chrome dont expect it to run Minecraft PE. As Ive said before people upgrade their phones far more frequently than they do with computers. You dont have the same worry on mobile that more than  of your users might be on obsolete hardware. You have that worry on desktop because normal people rarely upgrade their computer. The average iPhone user upgrades their phone every  years even if their hardware isnt considered obsolete. This is in part due to the fact that mobile carriers in the U.S. specifically encourage people to upgrade their phones. I mentioned Pokemon Go because its a perfect example of where you dont have to be afraid of supporting legacy hardware on mobile as you do on PC.,Minecraft,d6qszhv,1,t5_2r05i

9076127,0,t1_d82rmxk,yes that is what will happen. the reason those sorts of maps can work is because structure generation is set by the seed. the same code that rd party programs like amidst use is used by the maps. however one thing that may prevent this from happening is if the game actually checks to see if a dungeon is there or not. unlikely however. besides unless you already explored thousands of blocks in all directions i doubt it will break all the maps. seemed like you had to go pretty far for a single map. ,Minecraft,d82sxdw,1,t5_2r05i

9087393,0,t3_54q4q8,gtDo the new enemies seem a bit modlike to you?This was my first thought as well but to be fair any new features that depart significantly from what already exists is going to feel that way to a fair amount of players. Though honestly the exploration maps seemed more modlike than the mansion mobs.  Sure when you have something like the Husk  Stray where there are strong similarities to things already in the game it feels more natural. The shulker boxes feel more natural because they make use of an existing mob. Etc.  But I dont think an initial modlikeness reaction is the best thing to judge new content on. Relegating new features to only those that feel strongly tied to what the game already has would just be too limiting in my opinion. What feels vanilla is always changing  an argument could be made that anything beyond stone and grass doesnt feel like its part of the core Minecraft game but would any of us still be playing if there hadnt been any new features since those early days?  Thats not to say that it isnt possible for the game to change enough that an individual may no longer find it appealing. People change games change this is a way of life its neither right nor wrong to get to a point where a game no longer holds your interest. For the vast majority of us that will happen some day with Minecraft but it doesnt mean the game or its development has gone wrong nor does it mean we have. Its just how things are.,Minecraft,d845p6w,6,t5_2r05i

It would be cool to be able to add friends and see when theyre online and if theyre in game on Multiplayer you are able to join them on the server theyre on. Just thought that would be cool to implement! Nonetheless the new Launcher is clean and I feel this was more of an aesthetics type of change too. I like the tabs its basically simplified. I like how fast it is to change your skin switch accounts etc. Its basically a simplified rendition of Minecraft.net! Which isnt bad. Booting up Minecraft with the new launcher its a lot shorter wait time until you get to the splash screen but it did tell me Not Responding for under a minute and then it opened. And about the only able to have one Minecraft open only with the launcher I hope that gets changed. It affects people who record videos people who just want  launchers open in general! Overall I would give this a .. I can see changes in the future and hopefully theyre beneficial. ,Minecraft,d99o9nb,3,t5_2r05i

While rabbits feet are hard to come by unless you start a large farm and use a looting sword it still only costs  level because I personally have never found a really good use for the leaping potion.The Healing potions are L and L because the resources that go into them being gold and melon are somewhat difficult to come by if youre playing casually. Same thing for the regen potion.I kept the level requirements low considering the issue with commands being unable to take a set amount of experience away rather than whole levels. You could also treat the numbers  as potion tiers and adjust the prices higher that way.Just my suggestion though. Have fun on your realm!,Minecraft,d9bpz43,1,t5_2r05i

9776250,0,t1_dahnny6,Yep. Youve got a system with some randomness involved but its not completely random. A cow near a corner will have a  chance to stay near the corner. A cow near a fence edge will have a  chance to stay near the fence edge.So long as you have enough cows youll develop this sort of pattern if you watch it for long enough. And then it will sort of stabilize into this pattern. Even though you have  of cows near the corners leaving chances are that they will leave to be close to a fence edge rather than going towards the middle. And cows near a fence edge will be likely to move towards a corner which replenishes the cows that leave the corners.Interesting note This is somewhat dependent on the shape of the enclosure. Here were assuming a square enclosure. An equilateral triangle enclosure with the same area would have an even higher concentration of cows in the corners because they would be even less likely to leave than with a square. In a circular enclosure they would tend towards the fence but wouldnt clump up in any particular spot.For irregular shapes it would depend on a lot of different factors.,Minecraft,dai503b,2,t5_2r05i

9927522,0,t3_5hntvz,It probably was zombies but not a full siege.To make their stalls fully protected from zombies make the window to their stall  block high which will keep out zombies but not baby zombies and add a trapdoor. Zombies will see the trapdoor as a full block and assume its impassable even for baby zombies.And of course make sure each stall has a light inside so the zombies cant spawn INSIDE the stall.Actual zombie sieges were fixed awhile back so now they can only spawn on the outskirts of the village  in from the outer boundary of it.

10306351,0,t3_5nh9ih,Ok looks like you are new on Reddit so Ill try to give some positive notes and hints.First of all you are getting some negative feedback but dont let it get to you. Its important you try to understand and learn from the experience.The suggestionsSome people still post suggestions on rminecraft but the dedicated place for them is rminecraftsuggestions. The devs do check those ideas that doesnt mean they are obligated to add every good idea.Its a good pratice to get a feel of the ideas lurk for a few daysweeks so you can see what works and what dont. If you look at the posts that have zero points you can see common traits in some of them.Before suggesting searchBefore posting its always good to search if your idea was posted before. Some ideas are posted so often that it gets annoying people instantly downvotes them.To me if you mention anything with emerald toolsarmor I wont even read your idea. Why? Because emerald toolsweapons was suggested so many times for so many years! I could write a book about the topic but I digress...Also take a look at the Frequently Posted SuggestionsModdingYou may want to learn how to make mods that way you can try to implement your own ideas and also learn a new skill. I like the concept of chicken villagers that could be a cool feature.You can look at rfeedthebeast where many of the modders are. Also rModdingMC is a smaller community but can help. The Minecraft Forums have a section on modding that is very active.Good luck in the future.,Minecraft,dcca3hj,1,t5_2r05i

Just a little vanilla server for me and her. Nothing huge. Realms is the better option for me simply due to the ease of access to the adventure maps and minigames.With a normal server yes you can switch out the map at anytime but that requires not only a server restart but also actually FINDING a map you want to play. Realms has a selection right there for you.The same would go for a LAN session.gt You have the ability of adding any map you want past the limit of maps you get in realmsThere is no limit on Realms.

10466667,0,t3_5pwnvl,This was about  months ago and was on Console Edition. I was building a railway track in the Nether that led from my city to my new house I had just finished the day before. I had to build a stretch of the railroad over a large lava pool. I built the frame for the track so I went back to the nether portal on the other end of the track. I grabbed some rails and drank another fire resistance. When I got back to the part of the track I was working on a zombie pigman had spawned on the frame of the track. I punched him off the track into the pool of lava. I laughed about it and irl I grabbed my water bottle I had been drinking out of when all of a sudden a ghast shoots a fireball at me knocking me off. At this point I nearly choked on my water and I grabbed my controller trying to save myself. Fortunately I survived the fall since I had fire resistance with only  hearts left. Then the pigman I punched off into the lava pit instantly killed me from below. It took me another month to find all the iron necessary to complete the railway since all the tracks I had were on me when I was killed.,Minecraft,dcui4ty,9,t5_2r05i

You should probablly go in a bit better equipped than that but its not terribly difficult.Have blocks to build barriers between yourself and the guardians. Have a way to reset your breath meter. Torches work just fine. If you bring doors with you you can place them down to have a permanent safe breathing spot. You dont ever have to take damage from small guardians if you just shuffle between covers to obstruct their attack beams. When killing the large guardians there are  of them try to corner them into a wall and then build a barrier around you so that you are safe from any small guardians around and that the elder guardian cant attack you. The Elder guardian has Thorns on him which means you take damage when you attack him. Stop attacking to recover health if you get low.There are also some items which make attacking an ocean monument easier. An helmet enchanted with respiration will allow you to stay longer without breathing and will also make you see better under water. A night vision potion will also make it easier to see. You can blow up walls by placing TnT and a block of sand on top of it. A milk bucket will remove the mining fetigue effect temporarily.,Minecraft,dd4wkbz,5,t5_2r05i

The fact that currently structures refuse to generate if the biome is too small is mostly an arbitrary restriction that would require the addition of certain chameleon wildcard blocks to be added to structure generation not a legitimate space constraint.But yes technically I agree with you that it was the most proper though maddening imho way to close the reports.,Minecraft,ddr2wmn,3,t5_2r05i

Hes done a lot of series so basically start anywhere. If you want a team type video either Skyfactory more recent or any of his Complete the Monument maps are great. Also pretty long so be wary of that. But for building His Hermitcraft and Mindcrack seasons are great. I personally like Hermitcraft a bit more.

New mobs for each biome that you can discover. The biomes also have a bunch of new structures you can find with various treasures and secrets. A very in depth config file which allows you to tweak each feature individually from how often things spawn to whether or not some things even show up which will be great for modpack developers as well as people looking to maximize balance for their own games. We also went through and looked at all the most popular ideas that have been posted to rminecraft  rfeedthebeast and rminecraftsuggestions and took a look at what does and doesnt work about them so its been very community driven in that way even though its had closed development. I have a big list of credits for ideas and inspiration of course no ones models or anything were used without permission that I have to write up for the final release. This is why it was posted here as this sub has had an effect on the development of the mod Theres also a bunch of new items that you can find which not only work by themselves but work with other aspects of the game such as giving gold tools a use in the nether some items that work as more food or brewing etc. ,Minecraft,ddw6apu,9,t5_2r05i

They are supposed to be based on coordinates though so if you set up your portals with the correct scaling factor they will start working whenever thats fixed.Theres no minimum or restriction on how close or far portals can be you can have netherside portals right next to each other and have them connect to portals  blocks apart in the overworld.

Doesnt work with transparent images but comes preinstalled on Windows. Very easy to use but also far less advanced or useful than many other softwares. Photoshop Professional but perhaps a bit much for simple tasks such as resource pack making. Paint.NET which is my personal recommendation.

He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did.

11575930,0,t3_657vzx,You used the word you are looking for aesthetic. It defines a game. Look at limbo. That game has zero color zero dialogue and ominous music. However it tells a great story and is amazing in detail. Thomas was alone. Game has very very little detail in graphics and gameplay is mediocre. But the story telling and presentation is what defines it. It might be the greatest story telling ever. Shovel knight is throwback game that captures old genre of games perfectly and gives excellent gameplay. It is praised and looks old. Graphics are both what you look for. It is aesthetic. Which minecraft does have. I would say minecraft is the doom of this generation. A game like doom didnt master a genre it created its own and is still seen as a benchmark for greatness in that genre.

I think on a server my brother and I were hired by a mod to help fill in and build parts of giant spaceship builds while he was AFK. We discovered that certain areas were completely large hollow and dark. Mobs would spawn inside and that got to be incredibly annoying. After deciding to light those parts up to prevent spawning we figured we could make secret entrances into these places using pistons and hide things inside. One of the best secret doors was in the ceiling of a jail cell area. I remember having to quickly come up with a vertical facing down Jeb door at the top of a ladder with limited space while the mod was gone for that one. I guess we must have had plenty of resources to keep making sticky pistons and redstone equipment for these.In the end I dont think we were ever caught and we received our payment. in diamonds Later the area we were working in was WorldGuardd so we were no longer able to interact with our secret doors. ,Minecraft,dgd4o9d,18,t5_2r05i

Im trying to take this one step at a time.I did a little bit more research on the Invalid escape of n issue and for some reason in the new version it required an extra escape  so n became n and the command worked without escaping any other quotes. I know it should have required  backslashes to begin with but like you said .. seems to be very lenient.Then I took that working NBT data plugged it into the loot table and escaped all the extra quotes. As you can see below the only quotes left unescaped are before pages and at the very end of the tag. I ran the whole loot table through a JSON validator and it passed. Here is the full loot table JSON  The boat and baked potatoes were being awarded properly by the advancement before I started trying to add the book. I even tried adding an extra escape to the quotes to see if it was the same issue as the n but its still not awarding anything so I dont think thats the issue.,Minecraft,dgjskmw,1,t5_2r05i

I enclose them in stone to look good but it doesnt make sense that fire spreads four meters across. My houses look much better now.

11797055,0,t1_dgx07hf,Given how low the damage provided by Thorns is and how infrequently you get hit its virtually never going to make a difference in a fight. Especially when youve got a toptier bow and can oneshot common mobs from huge distances.Might as well not bother with the risk of potentially breaking armor armor is more fragile than tools anyway since Unbreaking is less effective on armor when the benefit almost never comes into play and will rarely be meaningful when it does do something.,Minecraft,dgx8itw,3,t5_2r05i

Im not a builder or a combat player so when they showed off the game by jumping into a cave and killing a ton of skeletons I was just like ...um okay then. Totally not into it.Fastforward a few years and Im browsing YouTube. I dont remember how but I stumbled upon the Redstone Wars series by GenerikB. I was like wow you can do electrical engineering in Minecraft?! From there I started searching for redstone tutorials found MumboJumbo and Xisumavoid followed them to the Hermitcraft series and other Hermits and...yeah the rest is history.Redstone and command blocks and now advancement command scripts FTW!
