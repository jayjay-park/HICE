I took many of what you call paramours to pass the lonesome nights. I suppose I would feel some guilt except that he had several concubines. At least until I disposed of the most irksome one.  She smiles that particular memory now documented in The Firsthold Revolt.And what of you? She asks the younger elf. You say that you hear taking a lover is fun. Do you not have a lover yourself? I hope you are not considering relationships only for political ends. If there is any support your nation needs I am willing to help you obtain it.

They had been traveling half the year and as the year came to a close they didnt know if they were any closer to finding the place for which they searched. They rose early in the morning and traveled all day until the sun set. As they slept at night a storm raged that threatened to tear down their tents. As the storm raged Talib heard the solemn singing of a woman from his tent. Talib covers his face and braves the storm unable to let the woman die in the storm.Talib approached the area that the singing was coming from. It was an area of calm in the middle of the sandstorm. At a fire sat a woman with a small stone in her hand. Weve found love in a hopless place. Hopeless place. Hopeless place sings the woman as the as Talib approached. Raliph! Is that you Raliph? she asks as Talib approaches. No I am Talib atBenu Baron of Gilane. Who might you be? She looks at Talib as he removes his face covering. She stands and bows to the ruler I am Makela Leki swordmaiden. I am not much into politics but I know that the ruler of Gilane is Baron Harran. Who are you really? At that moment a breeze broke their safe place dumping sand on the fire. The fire raged and from it came the image of a woman with the wings of a bird. I have brought you to a soft spot. These are places that during Numi atal attempts on our world that I create to protect and stabilize creation. I have brought you both here for you will carry out my will. In the morning follow my wind north and find the soft place that I have set for you. With that the spirit disappeared. Talib and Makela stood silently in awe. Makela speaks first Well it looks as if we have our orders. We should go. This snapped Talib from his daze Not quite yet. Could you sing for me once more? Makela and Talib sat together as she sung the moon high in the sky and a sandstorm raging around them. The next morning Talib awoke to a calm Alikr with no sandstorms. He took his men and headed north following a desert breeze until they reached Lekis Blade. ,ElderScrollsPowers,cvfjj61,1,t5_399hc

She clutches his hands. Our son our beautiful son. He shakes his head a pained smile on his face as he looks about for some sort of guidance. Our grandson her focus snaps. Hes going to dream love Angoril. Hes going to bring about a new world she whispers excitedly. Really? he squints his eyes sarcasm dripping from his words.A pause. They took my sight. They said I got too greedy and I best get my fill she exhales They were going to let me keep it...Mita Angoril scolds as he combs hair from her face. They showed me our children Angoril. Told me I best savor them because Id never see them in flesh she sighs brushing a tear from a glassy eye of wine. We might have a daughter soon she whispers in his ear A beautiful girl with hair the color of fire and your personality.That was my favorite thing to see of all the future possibilities and falsehoods. She sits up rising to her feet as she carefully walks about the darkness. Ash rises and she knows her surroundings. I saw our phalanxes advance on Tear and break the hinges of slaves cages with me at the point. I saw our Navy crush the Dominion. I saw our son at the head of a ship leading them merely pointing without the need to utter a word. I saw you die... Mita trails off. I was gray. Our children were grown and the next spring I followed you... But Im afraid the most pleasant possibilities of the future wont come to be.I saw myself fetching Endrys. I saw blood and black and needless waste. I saw a parrot singing words. I saw the Battle between the Saint and the Tyrant... Mita sits down the hovering ash collapsing as she thinks her mind in an incomprehensible frenzy.,ElderScrollsPowers,cxscrsn,2,t5_399hc
