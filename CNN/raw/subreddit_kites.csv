5201467,0,t1_cvcyoqw,There are some slight variations that work like the Benson Kites airbow.Im tempted to try and fly my rokkaku like a quad line kite since it has a  point bridalI tried to use my Rok as a quad line.... it might work but I need to make some adjustments on the lower lines. ,kites,cvcyxgj,1,t5_2rs0q
6870949,0,t3_3xpwtg,It looks from your video as if the kite is getting overpowered in high wind  or it may just not be a very stable design.Hopefully by now youve flown it in more gentle wind and it performs better.A droguetail basically a windsock that cups the wind for more drag might be a big help.  I would guess from that design that the kite needs more drag at the back end.  Google Piranha Drogue Kite Tail for one option that might at least keep with your sea life theme.It is hard to be sure but I do not think the kite needs adjusting it seems pretty stable before it gets tripped to one side  thats usually a symptom of too much wind for the design rather than a balance issue. Kites DO tend to trip to the same side when they get overpowered.Because it is bridled to a single point on keels I do not know of any way to adjust that for different wind speeds.Anyway if you have not solved the problem already try adding a drogue produces more drag than a streamer tail or just flying in lighter wind.,kites,d0v4thk,2,t5_2rs0q
7763346,0,t3_4lkoua,take a strap or cordmake  loops in ittie those with a larks head round the bundle of kites spaced so that you can sling them round your back. best fold the kites so they arent full length if you have big kites,kites,d3omr7d,1,t5_2rs0q

8784931,0,t1_d73gant,its the best rev out there no discussion here but its not a beginners kite,kites,d73sewy,1,t5_2rs0q
11460052,0,t1_dfu15a0,They are wonderful to fly! Like urabidbriefcase said they have a very strong pull which for me is part of the fun. You can change directions midflight in a split second. You need fairly high wind to fly the Rev. When they crash they crash hard! I think I broke a spar on my SOs the first time I was learning to fly it. ,kites,dfuzmpz,2,t5_2rs0q
