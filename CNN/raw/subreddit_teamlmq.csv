1547490,0,t3_2bywxj,Praise Travis for these revolutionary new ways to post Ongamers to reddit. Stick it to the man! But... I am still very confused about this situation. It seems like legally TC is right but ethically Sharon and AampK is right. Super messed up. This is the type of stuff the players set out to avoid too. ..,teamlmq,cja9285,2,t5_31iu9
1586343,0,t3_2cg69c,Curse beating Dignitas was expected but it still makes Complexity going to the playoffs even less likely. I dont think Curse will beat LMQ or TSM but who knows theyre  against LMQ right now and looked strong. Complexity winning their last  games against CLG and EG  Curse losing means that theyre in hopefully EG bows out gracefully but I doubt they do that.Outside of Curse vs LMQ the TSM vs C game is the most important one for LMQ. Would LMQ rather play CLGDIG or TSMC in the semifinals? TSM winning would all but guarantee that LMQ gets the st seed meaning that they would play CLGDIG in the semifinals. They could lose their last  games though and fall out of an automatic bye. C winning locks in LMQ at a bye since TSM couldnt win more than  games so all they could do is tie LMQ and would lose the tiebreaker in that case.The Curse vs LMQ game is interesting. LMQ is a stronger team imo but Curse has done well against them although some of the LMQ picks in their games have been questionable. I really want LMQ to win this one more than usual since winning it locks in a bye if TSM beats C  I want Complexity to get in the playoffs. Voyboy is a wildcard. He has trouble on the traditional champs in mid but if you give him a less traditional and likely AD champ he makes them work. Basically give him an AD champ and you might be in trouble he hasnt shown to be that good on traditional mids. NoName actually has the best record in the NA LCS on Rengar hes  though in neither of the games was he particularly impressive. According to Xpecial Curse is very happy with IWDominates performances on Rengar so far so we might see them pick Rengar.I think making sure that Xpecial isnt on Thresh would help a lot. Hes the best playmaker on the team and forcing him off Thresh would force someone else  likely Voyboy  to be the play maker. ,teamlmq,cjf4p9n,1,t5_31iu9

1749251,0,t1_cjzlqrn,No offense to TSM but Curse has looked like the nd best team in NA since the last super week. Im not saying TSM is weak just that LMQ and TSM havent looked as strong as C or Curse recently. I agree TSM doesnt look like an easy win. Though DIG isnt very strong TSM did take care of business against them and have had more time to work with Lustboy  Loco. It should be a good series. ,teamlmq,cjznhr0,2,t5_31iu9
