7198547,0,t1_d1vj7i7,Still working on the final catalog! Governor will be the same as the  updated graphic though. Going with a more black  grey topsheet instead of the red from  with some wild yellow bases. Keep your eyes peeled or stop by the shop and well show you what theyll look like!Glad to hear you like your PBampJs the Governor is quite the step up from them though. Stiffer core and a flatter tail give way to a hard charging ski. One of our rider  employees Tyler Curle rides the PBampJ in the park and does all his big mountain comps on the Governors he loves them both. We ended our on snow demos a few weekends ago so while we wont be up there on the hill it allows us to send demos out with customers over the weekend. If youd like to test out the Governors stop on by the shop anytime MondayFriday  and well get you set up for the weekend. Just make sure to bring a boot with you! ,momentskis,d1wf06l,1,t5_38e7k
