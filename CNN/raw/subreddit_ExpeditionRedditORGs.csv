11193976,0,t3_5zt68w,Well Im in a sticky situation. I am the last remaining member of the Verken tribe now that Nico is gone up against three Ontsags. I dont know how its come to this since we started up  but as it stands we have lost five Verken members in a row so I should feel really scared.Everybody voted for Nico so Id hope none of these guys found it surprising.I think everybody still has about an equal chance. Ashtons probably  in  since hes already into the final  with immunity and the rest of us are also about the same as each other. If I survive this vote I have just as much chance as anybody to win I think.,ExpeditionRedditORGs,df0to4c,1,t5_3ilzo

The target is crystal clear.We were all one big alliance until now with obvious targets previously and everyone went with the consensus. Now real alliances and connections are coming to fruition at this vote. I am aware of whose in possession of the merged tribe hidden immunity idol however its still unclear who got the swapped Guaymuras the hidden immunity idol. Hidden immunity idols could play a very big part in this game however if they are in the hands that I suspect theyre in it doesnt worry me. ,ExpeditionRedditORGs,dgjwrv0,1,t5_3ilzo
