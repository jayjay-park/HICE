743109,0,t3_22nv9o,Im just happy theres a zombie game coming to the PS really. And when they said a zombified America it kinda felt to me like huge cities was implied! The whole countryside thing might be just a starting area? And then you move on into parts of the country? Like maybe you can start in  different towns then move around cross country to survive etc? Im just crossing my fingers for a Europe Expansion and then people would have to go together to build ships or planes to get across could even do seabattles  half across the atlantic ocean and you run into a boat full of zombies you clear it out to find a crew in the engine room waiting for you BAM!I havent played Planetside or DayZ or Rust before since I kinda sold my old computer  years ago to get away from my WoW habits. So Im not sure whats up with those kinda games really? Been playing some FFXIV on the ps but thats that for newer mmos.  And with the whole thing about making your own fuel for cars and stuff could mean crafting airplanes  going cross country to find this and that part and so on. And for the fire part if its anything like say Dont Starve I can live with that!Can I burn an enemies base down if so what are the effects of this? I saw them talking about this go to somebodys base set it on fire and wait outside for them to try to escape then you can kill em or do whatever. For exp or rewards I have no idea tho.

755897,0,t1_cgq6hta,Humans are sticks with narrow view is more realistic than humans being able to interpret whats around them without having to look? No I stand by my statement that third person is more realistic. Obviously its not what you see. Youd have to be pretty dim to interpret that from what I said. Its what you experience. rd person gives a more realistic experience than first person.And a peeking system doesnt work anywhere near as good as roundcorner viewing. In fact its usually done so poorly that its only ever used vs AI in video games. I cant see a way in which first person would be fair to the player compared to the AI and a group of players. In fact my very first experience in Rust was being attacked by a group of people who were to my left behind me but I was so disoriented with the lack of senses that it took probably about  seconds of being chased to finally figure out where I was being attacked from. Thats not realistic. Thats terrible. If you want a hardcore survival MMO as people are stating its easier to play in rd person than to have SOE develop first person as something tangible. If they could manage peeking hiding sensory deprivation FOV models aiming bullet trajectory bullet registration responsive environments responsive weaponry responsive movement and everything else Ive mentioned then they should go ahead and make it first person.A good example of first person done well is Minecraft. But they did the opposite to what Ive said. Instead of supplying the things I want they removed the issues had with them. FOV doesnt scale because its blocks peekinghiding can be done with rd person toggle but terrible gameplay responsiveness doesnt matter and uneven territory isnt a thing so your senses arent required. ,h1z1,cgq7ago,2,t5_31a08

Players were turning off grass and lowering settings for the extra fps and the ability to see players.They fixed this by forcing grass to remain but giving different qualities for it.  keeping the same visual obstacle for everyone.Another thing that bugs me is something the War Z Rust also have issue with as do many other games is the gamma setting. Increasing it in order to see at night.I think Amnesia has a good answer to this problem.  Objects and terrain are not rendered outside of your visual distance based on light sources in the dark.  The only problem is that is that the moon counts as a light source so there will be a natural ambient light when its out....I guess they could simple remove gamma settings from the game itself but players could simply use nvidia geforce experience or some like program to change it anyways.....

Its all well and good to talk about insanely hard core punishing gameplay but the reality is that the game needs to be able to maintain a broad player base with a variety of interests. That means that logging on and getting ambushed and murdered instantly cannot be the primary way you interact with the game Its not fun its extremely frustrating and it will alienate a huge portion of the potential audience.

797234,0,t1_cguv65i,In real life most single shots to  of the body will likely kill due to main artery damage if the time taken to get treatment is too long. People can indeed take multiple shots and keep moving but they are basically dead on their feet without immediate treatment.Gameplay wise bullet damage as seen in Dayz would be ideal I dont what to see people soaking bullets applying a bandaid and soaking more bullets. Also gun play its self needs to be non run and gun.PvE wise if there are no gun handling effects then a player with  bullets can take down a group of  zombies with ease as long as its a single shot to the head so with that I would hope some sort of RPG style character effects are at least tested during development.Effects likeStamina weight of carried items Suppression Fear  may be zombie numbers based  panic.or on the flip side of those good effects like.Healthy conditions Courage  player number based .I cant think of any others but you get the gist basically what I am saying is high gun damage but make it harder to make clean shots based on the situation.,h1z1,cguwd1q,1,t5_31a08
797242,0,t1_cguvthi,sort of depends on how thats handled.  I would bet that everyone leaving stuff around would tax the clientserver with all these extra spaces.  Its a good idea but shouldnt be unlimited.Random loot here and there seem to be hinted at but how random are they and are they just lying around or are they in something?  I would imagine theres all types of caches available for putting stuff in.  Chests for lack of a better term could be hollowed out trees trunks of destroyed cars under a rock old refrigerators etc.  They could even use an inventory system so big items wont fit in small chests.  Possibilites are cool but having players just randomly dig an unlimited number of holes and expect the system to track it all is a little much.But if players will be given the ability to build safes or stash boxes with varying degrees of security then players can be given abilities to crack the security on the playermade chests.

798299,0,t3_23a5wc,I find it ironic that you say it cant be everyones perfect zombie game and then explain your ideal zombie game but some of the things you suggest for realism arent entirely accurate  gtGun wear amp tear An AK would last an extremely long time if it was rarely cleaned in fact most modern weapons would assuming you arent putting thousands of rounds threw it which you cant do in a Zombie apocalypse scenario anyway. You clean your gun after going to the range because its not a major inconvenience. Additionally something like this in a game would quickly become annoying to most players.   gtFood must be subject to spoilage  There have been preservation techniques from the medieval times that can ensure food can be stored for a pretty long time drying smoking lye salt canning etc. Food can still spoil but losing food in a week actually isnt realistic.  gtbases and forts deteriorating  Theres a line between obnoxious game mechanics and realism. A  mph wind causing my base to fall down is obnoxious a random event of heavy winds is fine. Upkeep on bases is better than similar on weapons and it wont turn off more casual players like weapon upkeep would forts are supposed to be a convenience and a luxury which should require more effort.    I agree  with the monetization. A monthly fee to start with a toolbox water and a bandage is perfectly fine. A monthly fee to start with a weapon which can kill zombies is also fine personally I wouldnt mind if they were able to start with a pistol and one mag but Im sure people will disagree.

803035,0,t1_cgvjf6j,So you want cowards to be forced to play with you and you get to decide if they live or die sounds like barrels of fun for them.You are right IRL there arent a lot of things like zombies respawning logging out items appearing out of no where etc. You can argue for a more realistic server but dont use the RL excuse.If you play on a hardcore or even regular server you arent going to deal with people being magically safe. You are going to deal with others like me that can shoot you in the face if we like. Im not going to be hiding behind any walls.Not sure how it is fair for players that want zero killing of each other to have to play your way. They can make a safehouse and what stay inside it ? Hope others dont attack them? Really that is fair? Or wait they can decide to fight back exactly what they dont want to do?This is a reason almost all games have split servers putting people together doesnt work. You speak as if the community can fit on one server. If anything they will need to open more and more to house everyone.This wont be DayZ with a server with  people on it. Not sure what you are so afraid of. There are plenty of people that have expressed wanting what you do.If they dont offer a hardcore server from the start dont see why they wouldnt you can hope to gather enough to make one. Surely with all those calling themselves hardcore around here you could muster up one lousy server.To me it sounds like you want cowards to spend their time buildingstoring supplies so you can then decide when you feel like it to come kill them and take it. Not sure how that works fairly for both sides. IRL they would defend themselves and not be cowards again this isnt RL they want the option to avoid this situation.Most regular servers will be filled with a mix of PVPers. Those that are more asses that just shoot everyone and those that actually work together. Both are still down for killing one another just one makes it the game and will probably suffer by the larger crowd for it. In RL bad people get punished.If you want a challenge play with only other hardcore folks and see how well the sever does. Should be very exciting bunch of lone people hiding the bushes cause no one is friendly enough to work together to do anything productive. Pretty much DayZ and why there are so many having high hopes for this game. People want more.What you want sounds terrible for a good chunk of potential players. Luckily SOE knows what they are doing and has been doing it for almost as long as Ive been gaming. They are going to make a lot of people happy and some not so much.

Actually no its obvious you dont know stuff.You will have to walk ages to play with your friends in HZ simply because there are only two ways to avoid that By spawning somewhat close to your mates and by actual quick travel. The former is most likley part of the H it just makes sense given that the world will be a few orders of magnitute larger than DayZ the latter is a big fuck you in the face of every player and needs to be avoided at all costs.And nights? If nights arent dark then whats the point of even having them? DayZ just went completly overboard because nights were completly pitch black and light sources were just mostly useless. Both of that is currently being worked on in DayZ SA. And given that Forgelights strong points is its lighting its save to assume that even with pitch black nights in H you have plenty of ways to make some light.The developers need to not remember a thing they need to UNDERSTAND a fundamental thing REALISM IS FUN! We gamers want challenges we want something interresting and HARD put in front of us so we can overcome the challenge and actually remember the stuff we did with joy.

827861,0,t3_23lj4f, renegadeimp  I realize that there will be a loot pile of sorts on the ground after a player is killed probably a la WarZ but being able to look in your bag a la Arma  DayZ mod is much more realistic and allows for thievery as well as for different bandit play styles beyond KOSing.  I could hold you up  search your bag and just take the food or weapons or whatever I wanted  leaving you to go about your way and have a possibility of surviving another day. There needs to be an associated sound effect so you know when your bag is being opened Epoch. Imagine two passing survivors deep in the woods  years after the zombie outbreak ... one gets the drop on the other  but instead of killing on site the person with the drop takes what he wants all the while feeling a bit paranoid that hell be shot while looting through this guys bag ... he doesnt die  its just the two of them for now so he leaves the other survivor to continue on his journey  his story ... Im not an RPer but theyve got to think of these kinds of scenarios if this is to be the game many of us hope it will for console  You cant have these kinds of fun realistic moments where youre accessing the morals or critical thinking skills or even just creating more paranoia etc with players if you have just a simple loot layout where you KOS them and a big pile of loot falls out of them like in WarZ.  My first DayZ bandit story involved shooting out the tires on a Ural and holding up the driver that happened to pass us out in the middle of nowhere. We were a week in and surviving well with full bags we saw his headlights coming and took up positions. Trying not to damage the vehicle too badly we fired  taking out the front tire.  We made him exit the vehicle and lay down on the ground and drop everything. My friend covered from the bushes as I held him up at close range.  We used his extra items in the vehicle to repair the car tire. I put his backpack and main rifle in the vehicle and I chatted with him as this was going down hows your night going whats your name etc etc  it was kind of surreal at the time for all. My friend got in and started up the car on the ground I left our victim a Makarov one clip one can of beans and a Pepsi  we told him not to move as we thanked him for the gear and car  and drove away. We watched him get up and pick up the gear we left him then tell everyone in side chat about his bandit adventure and being held up and actually left alive for the first time in DayZ lol. This was sooo MUCH more fun then sniping him from a bush ... or blasting him with an M from a tree or whatever.If you ask said player to drop all of his loot  but you cant actually be sure that he did maybe hes saving the best stuff for himself then all that leaves players to do  is shoot on site  so they can be sure theyre getting all the gear ... and they will.TLDR OMFG  not a loot pile but a way of accessing the other survivors inventory that could help curb KOSing.,h1z1,cgydo60,0,t5_31a08

836735,0,t3_23pnt4,Ive had mixed feelings about this from the beginning.On the one hand a survival situation is hardcore in general and there really is no safety other than those places you have made safe yourself or with others. Even those get compromised. DayZ worked because its not an MMORPG and the game was hardcore enough to force a level of immersion I havent seen in games in ages. That comes at a cost though especially for a persistent world MMORPG.You cant compare this game to something like SWG if the only people who play this game are hardcore PvPers. Quite frankly Im not really sure you will need a game of the scale Smed is planning either because you will be losing a lot of the potential player base from the outset along with diversity of that base. What you have is ludicrously large persistent world DayZ which makes this a very very niche game.As I said Im torn because I think this game has to be hardcore in most ways but if the goal is to create this huge interesting sandbox game set in a postapoc world then making it a persistent version of DayZ is never going to put enough players in to make it happen.Ive made posts about this before but one of the key things that made Star Wars Galaxies special and work was player diversity. The game basically catered to everyone from socialites to crafters and scientists to combat lovers. HZ seems to be at this early stage very onedimensional when it comes to playing. What and who exactly will fill up this huge game world as it grows? Will it just be vast empty spaces where you never find other players?,h1z1,cgze0yx,5,t5_31a08

I think it would be great to takeover an area and be able to stake a claim allowing other players to see that they have entered an area controlled by your clangroup. Not that the sign would give a playerclan any special claim to the area but just as a way to communicate with the masses.

Another stack of bandages or a second weapon for example. more resources if applied to loot also seems to fall into that category. IMHO there is not much difference between being able to buy ammo food etc and finding extra food ammo etc that is not available to FP when looting the same source.PS was a different paradigm where you could buy boosters to points which allowed you to unlock items faster but that is way different than getting more loot.,h1z1,ch09rug,1,t5_31a08

It is they are fighting what they think is a spiritual war against dead people or spirits True story.  Witch trials done by witches tragically funny but true.  Also why some burned books and did not like impressionist painting and blew up statues or idolstaliban   And I can prove it but you have to know the us and them is about a self proclaimed right to monarchy while everyone else does not have divine right based on a religious belief and them thinking that gives them the task to root out the enemy spirits.

911633,0,t3_24k4yt,I like how the treecutting looks.Maybe if HZ can implement the likes and where you have to pickup the wood from your the ground and maybe have it animate the pickupputinbag process.Same can be said for entering a vehicle have the character reach out for the door open it and get inside then close the door.Actually it should be like that for any door. These may all sound trivial but games especially immersive games have been doing this for quite a while now. And it really adds a lot. Makes your character feel more connected to the world and a lot less arcadey.Basically I think its best to go for complete animations for most of the interactable stuff. Look at The Lust of Us. Even just looting an items playa an animation where the character extends their arm rougly to the area where the item is. Its no exactly grabbing the item just pretending to grab it as it disappears and goes into your inventory. And in this game HZ I think its important to know whos grabbing what. In its current form looting has no animation and just teleports items to your inventory. By staring at it. ,h1z1,ch7wpyi,3,t5_31a08

953719,0,t1_chcmghw,So as a left handed man I take issue with you referring to my existence as being odd not really  . Also my controls arent inverse gt|Left handedness isnt just Oh I chose to use this hand instead or something as trivial as that. Your body naturally chooses which hand you are more proficient with based on which hemisphere of the brain you are stronger with. Each hemisphere of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. So Left brained people use their right hands and Right brained people use their Left hands. Another thing each hemisphere of the brain processes information significantly different. Left hemisphere focuses on organizing information in a cause based line of events which lends itself to logical conclusions. The right hemisphere on the other hand process information in a sort of associative whether through cause or other rationality Web and as such is a bit harder to extend long logical arguments however excels at understanding the entirety of an issue seeing things from different perspectives In a sense and expediently arriving at a potential solution to more complex problems.With this in mind its worth noting that everyone uses both hemispheres of their brains and handedness is only an effect based on which hemisphere is more prominent.In short lefthandedness is not actually something you could emulate in  a video game and yes I did just waste all my time typing this up instead of just going Lolz left handed people dun hand backwards ya hurp?With all that said I like your post!,h1z1,chcp2c6,1,t5_31a08

954492,0,t3_251ck0,Im so happy to see suggestions aimed at making this a more realistic and less KoSy postapocalyptic experience! DI agree SO much with your analysis and Im not trying to shoot this down I think you might be onto something. I want however list a few things that I think need consideration A sanitymeter is a rare occurrence in games the only other game I come to think about right away that have it would be Dont starve. It must be VERY well communicated ingame to the player what it is and what affects it. I assume there is already a hunger and woundmeter in this game or will be. It could be that another parameter to keep up would be too much. But maybe not. Most all of the acts you suggest would improve sanity doesnt seem very hard for a potential KoSplayer to keep up and players are creative. This in turn means that the act of killing another person would have to have a severe and lasting effect on sanity to deter from killing. Is penalty for KoS really the way to go I wonder...? People who inherently want to PvP will hate getting punished for it. I would PREFER to come up with something that instead gives players a strong positive incentive for not killing. I.e. making a friendly meeting potentially much more beneficial than KoSnLoot but then we talk about interdependency between players which in turn probably needs rolesspecialization in order for two players to have a significant benefit to each other which in turn dont go well with permadeathloss so I dunno... sigh...You might be onto something but I think it in that case it should perhaps be less complex and something that targets the killbehavior only and doesnt affect the entire playerbase. Something like two kills brings meter down to  and then it slowly recovers over time its ok to hate me for this and I dont really like it either.If you ask me one of the main reasons for KoS behavior is lack of other things to do and strive for in these games. There has to be more things to do and accomplish that gives players a sense of satisfaction things that caters to the needs of the players.I think there is small minority of players who are actually in these games because they REALLY enjoy killing another player and who get satisfaction from taking the gear the other player spent hours or days to find. Most but not all could be won over to a more realistic behavior if the game would cater to their needs in new and other ways.,h1z1,chcs8fv,6,t5_31a08

964867,0,t3_255bbz,A mostly enterable city can be done and with decent graphics and detail too The Division and Watchdogs look real nice for aesthetics combining the amount of zombies you can get in Dead Rising I dont understand why it hasnt been done either.Putting effort into creating a character would make you really attached to it like the first time you played DayZ you didnt want to die on your first time you wanted to live forever.  Sure if you keep dying youll probably get sick of it well try not to die as much.Choosing jobs hobbies traits etc is a must but it wouldnt restrict you in choosing additional proficiencies in game like choosing a class you are usually restricted to that skill set unable to learn or do anything new this wouldnt be good in a game like this with so much freedom.Not keen on the cure part the thing with the zombie apocalypse is there is no cure and no where is safe zombies will find you and if you get infected and escape perhaps your body deteriorates over a  hour in game period before you die and turn so you could still be useful to your friends by sacrificing yourself to lure zombies away or something this would create some memorable moments for sure.,h1z1,chdyqd9,2,t5_31a08

968009,0,t3_256s62,Yep.  I hope they will have a lot of stuff laying around.  I mean...these people that got infected and turn into zombies...but they didnt take all their belonging with them.  Like if there is a toaster left in the kitchen in a abandon house I will use that as a weapon if I want to survive.  It should have the element of survival where anything can be used as a weapon if they know how to use it and hit vital spots on a zombie to effectively kill it.  They can also add hit items like flower vase plates mugs or a chair where you hit a zombie once it breaks but still do a little bit of damage or stun the zombie for a sec so you can make a run for it. ,h1z1,chebm87,1,t5_31a08
969966,0,t3_257dqp,It can be tuned easily to have a threshold below it they will ignore the heat source.My concern about this is what happens when they reach the heat source?Like they reach you and kill you then what? They are at the most heat filled area where do they move from there? Are they stuck there?IMO instead of heat areas they should just get a vector to the heat source. This way they cant follow you forever if they lose the trail they just continue moving in the same direction.

978832,0,t1_chfibdw,While aiming Id like to see something like this.Maybe this way it wouldnt have to reduce accuracy by too much and could possibly have a blinding effect when someone looks deadon at you. I would think it would lower accuracy for both handers and handers since you wouldnt be able to use your second hand to help stabilize for a hander and would add weight to the weapon for handers.Perhaps... While holding only a flashlight it has better visibilty overall... Like you can aim it and point it around.When you have a weapon and a flashlight equipped the flashlight would not have as good visibility until you aimed your pistol or handed weapon. When you aim you would be able to point it around and all that.Edit added more.,h1z1,chfjv9j,5,t5_31a08

I highly agree that we need bandits i think natural disaster riots have shown that when things get real and order starts to drop people go a bit crazy and ignore all the rules for personal gain like stealing tvs or supplies. I imagine a place where society has completely fallen people would be willing to kill others for the sake of personal gain because they dont fear punishment for their actions and i dont think we should discourage something that would be realistic because some people cant handle running into others.Really making KoS this evil thing that nobody will ever want to do would ruin the experience and fun for some people and also make the game lose any tension it has because while zombies might be a threat people with guns should always be the thing that makes your palms sweat.,h1z1,chfqbft,1,t5_31a08

1008410,0,t3_25ni1w,nd Lt. Pufall at least that what I used to be called.  I still cling to that name though.  Gives me something to remember.  Fresh out of college I finished the AFROTC training program and was going to be the pilot of an F.  My dreams were finally being realized.  I was at Randolph AFB in Texas when it happened though.  At first none of us believed it the reports we were getting the calls we were receiving.  I think that we just didnt want to believe it.  But reality struck us hard when we were ordered to close off the base to everybody and await further orders.  I can still hear every mother and their child begging us to let them in and we only did once the zombies caught up to them.  So many of them died in less than  minutes trampling over each other to get into the safety of the Air Force Base those less fortunate eaten where they lay.  Our commander didnt leave his room for two whole days after that happened.We were doing really good for a while.  We had amassed a large amount of food and medicinal supplies we had set up a tent city for everybody crops were being grown just off of the runways and we were surviving.  Thats all we could do right?  But then we started to grow restless wondering when the next order would come in.  After a while we realized there may never be a next order.  We may be the last remaining Air Force Detachment left on the planet.  Our commander took a few of us and sent us out to search the other bases to see what their story was.  My group was sent up to the MidWest since we all originated from there.  After packing our bags and loading up the plane we wished the base good luck and took off.  I still havent seen any group larger than four or five people just living off of whatever they could find.  I hope to God that when I get to my home I dont find the filthy rotten apocalypse we saw at San Antonio.,h1z1,chiwwxa,2,t5_31a08

I presented one that addresses the problems this game is going to face in its current direction.gt Id feel even more sorry for anyone that actually bothers to read any of this. Of course you would.  Because you dont have any intention of putting out ideas to improve the game.  You only respond to try and prove me wrong and have failed so badly that you ignore things i say to even attempt to have a valid counter argument.gt See again target audience. See again larger target audience  more players  more successful.gt DayZ mod DayZ SA WarZ and Rust alone have over  million copies. This isnt even including anyone that might be interested based on the genre alone. Theres  million that bought DayZ and  million that bought Rust.  Peak players today both games combined.... players.  Obviously people are going to start playing due to the curiosity.  What keeps them playing is what makes a game successful.  Your very response AGAIN shows how fucking short sighted you are and you cant look past initial purchase of the game and understand nothing about player retention.gt Player retention does not invalidate a target audience or number sold. The fact is the games are poor quality. There is a large vacancy in big name developers and thats why we have HZ. The audience is there the numbers prove it. Player retention was the ENTIRE IDEA BEHIND MY SUGGESTIONS.  ROFL.   The fact is the other game are poor quality  Really?   So you prove yet again that the direction theyre taking is the wrong one. Which then goes back to player retention. ROFL.gt You dont understand sarcasm either? Of course i do.  I just dont give a fuck.gt And it turns the game into a deathmatch. Congratulations youve invalidated a core concept and exacerbated the problem even more. Evidence points that this genre is already a deathmatch.  It doesnt exacerbate anything.  If anything it reduces the desire to randomly kill people because of reasons ive ALREADY stated.gt Only if you believe that youre the only one aware of the issues which youre not. this response doesnt even make sense or have any relevance to the post its responding to.  Obviously im not the only one aware of the problems in the game which is WHY i posted those links.  Dumbass.  ROFL!gt This doesnt invalidate what I said. Of course it does.  If there isnt anything to do in the game then how long is the long term goal.  The average life span of a player in DayZ is a little over an hour.  Then you die an lose everything.  What kind of fucking long term goals can you accomplish in  hour.gt No thats exactly what it means. You can question who they target all you want but it doesnt change the fact that there is a market that theyre targeting. Never did i say there wasnt a market.  But as you prove time and time again you ignore the parts that give my responses its context.gt Thats not how marketing works. It doesnt seem like you have the intelligence to realize im not trying to change their marketing strategy.  Im trying to change the target audience to apply their marketing strategy.  Dumbass.gt Ya dont say? yeah. Evidence?  See above.gt I didnt set out to fix all of the problems with DayZ Rust etc. with one post. I suggested a feature that would add depth to the game in its current known state and listed the benefits and potential drawbacks of the feature. and when i disagreed instead of providing further explanation on how it would work you resorted to basically giving me the same answer over and over again. Then stopped altogether talking about your idea and only concentrated on ignoring comments and facts that i present arguing my case just so you can put words on the screen.gt Holy shit the irony. I argue my points and expect people to be able to counter them with factual evidence disproving what i say if they disagree.  However the fact that you literally ignore points i make shows that you cant.gt There is no such thing as mass market game design. Developers find a market and target it. In the case of HZ theyre targeting  million people. Of course there is.  Why do you think theres  million unique players playing league of legends.  Is every game or every genre capable of getting that many players?  No.  However theres still the common sense of trying to target the largest possible audience while also giving them a reason to KEEP PLAYING after the initial wow factor and learning phase of the game is over.gt How would you know? You havent even played it. The game is flatout broken right now theres nothing wrong with the general concept and the sales validate that. gt Oh the irony and arrogance is so strong it hurts. It would only be ironic if i ignored any valid arguments against me.  Instead i address them to the point where you cant come up with a counter argument. The only arrogance in this entire thread is how you expect people to take your ideas into consideration with your pathetic ability to present it.

Fair enough. Flying an apache helicopter? No.Looking at this from a different perspective is that high powered weapons break some immersion sure its cool to have an ma but its not a survival weapon whereas something like a hunting rifle has a genuine purpose besides murder and the backbone of this game is survival not all out deathmatches like DayZ has currently.Besides that everything you suggested has been suggested and a majority of them the community doesnt like  such as apaches tanks and cal snipers.,h1z1,chl3lfh,1,t5_31a08

They arent stamping out little bugs they are trying to make the game not completely broken before selling it. I see what you mean about it making them look bad but certainly not yet. If it released in a week it would still only be a minor delay. An example of the other end of the spectrum is watchdogs being delayed half a year after its official exact release date. ,h1z1,chobem0,1,t5_31a08

They already said theyll make some sort of factions and Id like if they dont use the nametags to show that youre in that and that clan.Radio? Of course!OMG Shoot himher? This has been discussed alot and they agree to make this possible. Sobasically if someone wants to kill you? Hell have to do it twice.HunterGatherer? What the Fuck man? Its all your choice there are already berries deers and wolves to hunt for food and stuff. Take flower and make herb? Maybe simple tea or such.Reasons to team up? No there are already many good suggestions already on the reddit for this.Check our pad? What do you want with this? No there are already going to be factions. But only to keep you informed of whos with you. Youll have to build by yourselfwith items in your hands at the time.War? This will be player decision. Everyone can make a war but NOT Declare war You got a marked enemies by red kill them Buddy System? Idk maybe.NoobKill Camper  I wanted this aswell. But not like this after  mins. It should depend on enviroment. Like how many zombies are and how far away. Not like horde would hear a shot from mm in deeeeeep woods or such? Maybe  zombies come there.,h1z1,chuv6n0,1,t5_31a08
1113677,0,t1_chuv3ki,gt Height no sky towersThey already stated they were most likely limiting it to  modules. I could see the height reaching maybe a little past that if they let you construct a single tower without stacking.gt Width no creating a  room motel like structureThe bases you can build have a predefined foundation.gt Location no building fortresses inside citiesYou would probably have to find a street wide enough but I dont think that it will matter as much in as in DayZ for a few reasons. Bases will be destructible Loot will be better spread throughout the game not just concentrated in the cities. In a real life Apocalypse you would find these types of situations. They plan on making the zombies an actual threat.Id imagine that if someone made a base in a town and shot their rifle they would have to devote a lot of time to killing zombies that heard it.,h1z1,chuvtog,1,t5_31a08

Maybe you could change his mind on what a good path for this game could be but you burned that bridge by immediately jumping to insults when you dont need to.

1153440,0,t3_27c4ke,I dont agree with your argument as there are plenty of people who would like to play on both pvp and pve servers. Playing on pvp but with a friendly attitude for the most part and trying to make a community knowing that it could be raided by people as well as zombies but also wanting to totally pve in  such a server to work towards a big community against mainly zombies too. The argument that it is going to split the player base for me makes little sense. Why? because those who truely dont want to pvp and only pve wont be playing at all if there is no pve server. Those who like to play both if only having the option of pvp will probably still play but if there was an option for both they would still probably play on both too. For different game experiences. It seems the argument has gone from the initial response of pvp players of if you dont like hardcore pvp go play another game which means they wouldnt be playing the game at all To oh but we need pve players for balance  the same pve players that before where told to go play some other game  Seems to me some people just dont understand choice and also dont understand that you cannot polarise gamers into just  seperate categories. IT isnt a case of pvp or pve players there are many players who enjoy both for different reasons who will play bothin very different ways.,h1z1,chzdla8,6,t5_31a08

More in house stories really help with immersion and an initial player experience.    Dont worry I read the thread this is just to give perspective on why some wouldnt want kids in games.What I dont feel comfortable with is seeing and dealing with actual zombie children. Now dont get me wrong. We in the internet are use to a lot of gross stuff. Ive seen decapitated heads assassinations murders and all sorts of stuff. But one thing I cannot handle is seeing little kids get hurt.  It really drives home to a deep emotional level when kids are involved. It involves my past and to my sisters children who I love extremely. I would run through razor blades dive into shark infested waters and jump off a roof if it meant protecting those little girls Ive helped take care of and loved.  Im all up for immersion but as soon as I have to make the decision to bash a little zombie girls face in with my base ball bat. I nope the fuck out. Cause in my mind Im hitting my little niece.

But anything that effects PVP shouldnt really be a thing. I dont think there are police stations yet so finding a bullet proof vest probably isnt likly. Id rather it be something thats craftable so it expands the possibilities of crafting and can be somewhat easily obtainable for the purposes of defending yourself against PVE.Ive mentioned in a few other posts that getting hide from an deer wolf or anything should be able to be dried tanned exc. and made into leather which has already been talked about as a possible feature in the most recent live stream though if they were serious of in the heat of the moment spewing ideas Im not sure which can then be used to make certain leather goods like cosmetic cloth or in this post a reinforced leather plating only good against mele attacks worthless against bullets.,h1z1,cidnijk,1,t5_31a08

There will be proximity voip in game so not only will you have text of swearing you will be able to hear them swearing.  Im fairly certain there will be filters that can be turned on and off for text since SOE has that in place for the rest of their games and more than likely voip will be optional to listen to as well.As far as violence in the game It probably wont be quite cartoonish and not quite real world like Dead Island but enough that it might upset a  year old.  Ive played in some games where the player could turn the blood splatters and stuff off.  Not sure if SOE will have that built in.I will have to check the game out before I allow my  year old son to play.

And from what we have seen from DayZ after  years of alpha? and the early footage of HZ is what i am talking about. Neither of them can be considered a game yet and HZ looks a hell lot more promising than DayZ from what weve heard about their ambitions and plans.Why would being backed by a huge company bother you..? That should be good no? More resources faster development higher quality. Did SOE fail many times in the past? I though Everquest was overall a pretty big success Everquest Next looks amazing and ive been playing EQN Landmark since alpha and its awesome.I dont know why you bring up the initial date again they said it was a mistake to say anything. They want to develop the game alongside the community and that means letting us in at a very early stage in the game but after internal discussions they decided to postpone the release of early access and add some important features they felt the game was lacking.As for Jimmy being overhyped thats just how he is..

To me a premium membership is just something that gives you priority server access.  Not special items or rules just the ability to get into the server faster whenif it is full.  So instead of taking a few minutes to get into the server it might only take  seconds and only when the server is full which may not even be that frequent.

I hate websites that have their own system for bug reports theyre all the same like...Are any of these your issue? No? Type in a key word and well do another search... No still not one of these? Okay email us! IMO leave it where it is as this seems to work better.    On clans Ill bet cashmoney that theyre gonna use a system similar to that of PlanetSide. Could be wrong though. Yes guns and ammo will be uber rare. You might find a vehicle but it may be be missing  tires the transmission gasoline steering wheel spark plugs and the car battery. Have fun getting one up and running and good luck! In the EA there is only a Jeepoffroading vehicle. This was done so that the team could focus more on other more important features. But their vision is to have EVERY vehicle be fixable and drivable even the ones that are currently just place holdersloot spots. So no you wont be getting a vehicle within the first hour of playing if you do I call hacks! lol. And setting up a base? Yea I once heard a dev say that it would take weeks and thats with a vehicle and if you played long hours every day. Vehicles wont be EVERYWHERE for the time being. But if you watch the streams youll notice that there are quite a bit of campsites with trucks cars and campers. Again their vision is that eventually these will all be usable as vehicles.

I am just saying like if your wanting to fortify a base and need  lumber to do all the walls instead of having to cut down  trees you could take over the lumber mill a few hours and get the lumber you needed.  So more convenience than required.  Such as the guns and such I was talking about they could all still be lootable but if you were able to takeover a certain manufacturing plant you could make like  or  a day with required materials.  Nothing majorly game changing or huge leap ahead just streamlining places.

That the playerbase has devolved into KOSing is because of THAT exact logic. And as we can see some of the playerbase is pretty tired of it Id say a good portion. This issue keeps coming up on every zombie survival forum. But they are the ones enforcing that logic that everyone wants to KOS you by KOSing everyone they see themselves. FLAWED LOGIC. Your own fault.Lead as a good example if you want to stop the KOS.. Dont do it just because you are scared. Then you become part of the problem and by no means a solution.,h1z1,cjgpg3d,2,t5_31a08
1599740,0,t3_2cjy27,One of the big struggles with building cities is the sheer volume of content there is to make. The current tools support prefabs which are basically template groups of anything in a game. These work well enough for creating content quickly but if used liberally will reveal what appears to be lots of copypasta and honestly thats exactly what it is.If were going to have skyscraping apartment and office buildings like youd find in any metropolitan downtown we need a way to generate fairly unique content in a procedural manner. This will allow us to create handcrafted set pieces that fit into a procedural generation scheme thus giving us the ability to create massive amounts of unique content in a short amount of time.The alternative is every corner office of every floor in a skyscraper and every copy of that skyscraper looking exactly the same with the same furniture the same pictures on the wall and the same loot boxes. Basically the alternative is a boring experience for the players.Another alternative would be to go the route of Tenpenny Tower in Fallout  make the first two or three floors explorable and the top two floors explorable but ignoring absolutely everything in between. That worked okay for the singleplayer sandbox but in our MMO survival game we dont want those sort of artificial limits.All that being said we want you to have fully explorable metropolitan wastelands to fulfill all your spartakickaplayeroffaskyscraperrooftop desires. You just probably wont see that for EA.,h1z1,cjgte6s,4,t5_31a08

1700196,0,t1_cjtejgx,yea which is why i also said gt if the devs opted to go the cheap way of doing things they will just increase the loot rate for ammo. which i think is lazy and definitely cheap.pcoz actually making a forging system capable of producing metal tools and ammo needs ore from mining or plenty of scrap metal from looting. not to mention the devs will actually have to develop the actual system itself making molds etc..which is why i said that increasing the loot spawn of ammo is the cheapest and laziest way of doing it.coz without ammo guns are useless. and yet the devs have yet to reveal any solid plans about crafting ammo.so im guessing theyre probably gonna go the lazy way of doing things and just increase the loot spawn for ammo..,h1z1,cjth0j0,1,t5_31a08

Thats been said several times by devs.  So making one area more dangerous than another? Also confirmed as not going to happen. Devs want to avoid the sort of thing that will allow players to monopolize on equipment or zones by making them more or less difficult to survive in. Its the same concept as making high loot spawn zones where theres a higher chance of a gun spawning just not gonna happen. Mainly because the devs want you to explore the entire map not just part of it. ,h1z1,cjx35od,-1,t5_31a08

Guns in planetside are only side grades. Meaning that The beginner guns are good for medium short range to medium long range. Buy a new gun it might suck for long range but be better for short range or it might be better for long range but suck at short range.

Occasionally you can come across a car or lost backpack with something good in it.Any buildings usually have a group of zed.   Its dangerous but youll typically find at least a few food and water.   If youre lucky therell be a gun safe with guns andor ammo. An airdrop drops  crates each always has food usually has guns andor ammo.  The quantity per is the same you can find in a single house.   The real benefit is that there are rarely more than  or  zed. Wilderness.  PVE low.  Loot low.  PVP low. Towns. PVE high.  Loot high.  PVP medium. Airdrops.  PVE low.  Loot high.

2134192,0,t1_claj55q,gt Its too farmable. Whats to stop me from sitting outside Hero City or some other high loot spawn location and flag a hero follow him if he tries to run and then snipe him. Especially if I have a large group of people with me to accomplish this.If you are a bandit which you say you are there is no reason to flag a hero.  Nor is there anything stopping you from doing that.  If you are saying that you will be a hero just so you can flag another hero and kill them then you are simply just confused.  You could do that but only once every two days.  Even if you had a group they could each only do it once every two days.  What do you do for the two days after youve done this?  Do you just not play or do you just hide?  Moreover as soon as you flag someone it gives it away that you are near.  It is no longer an easy kill.   chance you might be the one killed instead.  Its not something you would do very often.gtMy problem isnt that you want a Karma system. Its that everybody thinks they have the perfect solution and they dont see the flaws in their own plans.Sure sounds like you dont want it implemented at all.  I never said the solution I presented was perfect those are your words.  Most people in this thread have expressed concerns and or improvements but that is not what youve done is it.  You have your own opinions and rightfully so.  Just dont try and pass them off like they are fact.gtIf a Karma ruleset or any other feature for that matter did what the concept was originally intended for encouraging people to play along and not KoS then I wouldnt mind playing on that server.Then hopefully SOE implements it and you can give it a try.  If it doesnt work then Ill be the first to admit it assuming they implement something that is functional.  If it works then maybe well see you in the server as well.  ,h1z1,clb3pew,2,t5_31a08

This is the thing that most people fail to realize in the game development world. People are quick to say things like Why have holiday events? Youre wasting your dev teams resources on this. In this case it is game modes. The thing is the coders who work on these things do not work on other parts of the game. The expression too many cooks in the kitchen spoils the broth applies directly to this. You cant have everybody working on the same thing or toes get stepped on and it becomes very counterproductive. So they couldnt just take these coders off of the creation of game modes and put them on developing core systems for the mmo gameplay because theyd be in the way of the team already doing it. This is why there is always segmentation in design teams. A lot of people float from position to position but only on an asneeded basis for smaller teams.Long story short the people developing game modes are doing so because they are best suited for the job. Their skills apply less to other sections. They are probably experienced in this very thing so they know how to implement it already. ,h1z1,cmq48zm,0,t5_31a08

2545831,0,t3_2ovenf,guy talk all you said exactly the way I think people who disagree with the value or not agree to pay more for a package that offers more game modes which simply do not buy wait to get the FreePlay. Most of the games we have to buy the HZ you either need to buy just you wait for the game to be finished buy and play before is an option. The game is worth the value that is being charged and the most expensive package will offer ways that we had not even imagined it would.What I found interesting in these different modes of play is that this will give a better distribution in the types of players players who want action kill full pvp will have more propitious servers for this so the survival of servers will be busy with players who want to survive.,h1z1,cmqvkph,2,t5_31a08

Like other people have mentioned making people have an insane bar after killing people which can only be remedied with scarce pills would help.I also think Zombies need to be more dangerous especially with hordes. So that people actually see other survivors and see them as a potential ally instead of a loot bag. Imagine you board up a house with your friends. Overnight a few zombies are outside but you log out to go to sleep.

They will try and validate their position saying they are doing it to support the developers be part of the development etc but what it really comes down to is they are hyped up and arent willing to wait when everyone else is playing.SOE are banking on this theres a reason they gave access to a lot of big youtubers in the genre hype sells games and SOE need the game to sell because they have no idea how to monetize it without it becoming PayWin as even cosmetic items have their advantages so this is much less risky for them weve already seen some other terrible decisions made because of this with the Battle Royal tickets.,h1z1,cn5oxk1,3,t5_31a08

For doorways socket them so we can either place a door or do a full barricade.Advanced lock for an existing door could be the medieval locking bar system non removable but would reinforce and existing door.Like those ideas? ,h1z1,cnazomv,2,t5_31a08

In servers where bases are indestructible players will have to make periodic maintenance in their base especially if they are attacked by zombies otherwise their bases will decay and vanish after some time.

Shareholders will cut their losses rather than try to plug the holes on a sinking ship and lose even more money.

2808479,0,t3_2s923j,Unknown Ive been trying to get people to pay attention to a HUD free idea that moves stats and stuff to a battery powered GPS or something of that manner.But since most of the people using this subreddit dont know how to use reddit shit just keeps scrolling off the front pages and posts that are  months old are on the hot list cause SOEs using Reddit and the audience theyre inviting over here dont know how to use Reddit.Anyways that aside currently all we really know is that the UI is adaptive but I dont think it can be turned off and other than some rather basic blood particle effects there isnt any other visual feedback for starving or really needing water yet...so not having a UI is kind of a functional problem at least in the early going.I do hope they eventually remove the UI entirely push all stats to a hand held monitoring system that you actually have to look at and give woundeddehydratedhungrysick feedback with visual and audio cues that remind people to eatdrinktake care of themselves....I hate health bars in survival games they take you right out of the experience and visually reinforce at all times that its just a game.,h1z1,cnnbdeg,1,t5_31a08

The only update after that is on release day when allot of people have already bought the game commenting on air drops which the community have interpreted as saying the game is PW now. Its kind of a dickbag move changing what they should know is a big part of the game as perceived by the majority of the playerbase from FP to PW after people have already bought the game. Anywho Im not sure anyone cares if them getting mad annoys you they are providing feedback to an EA title which the devs are all encouraging and say they are listening to. Although I think its good I also think it could be done without allot of people losing their shit.

2839820,0,t3_2smcyy,Im not certain why everyone is saying this is pay to win? I thought all the Cash Shop items were skins?Secondly people say WarZ was crap because it was crap. It was a large steaming pile of shit. The early access for that game was logging in and getting spawn killed every  seconds.The community and internet didnt cause me to hate it. The game itself caused me to hate it. The constant script kiddies and spawn killing outright ruined the whole experience for me.Now with that being said if HZ is indeed a clone of that shit then I will regret spending the  I did last night I havent been able to log in yet due to all the issues but thats typical anymore.However it seems to me that this game is in a better state in its prealpha than WarZ ever was AND is miles ahead of DayZ SA which has been in developmentprealpha twice as long.Your diatribe above is nothing more than a bitter attempt at justifying a shitty game with another game that has yet had anytime to grow.  months down the road who knows?

2844899,0,t3_2pqxxt,I can see the need for nametags when players are your allies as you can quickly identify A that they are friendly and B who they are. This is an important thing in an MMO. But it makes no sense to me at all to highlight enemies or potential enemies strangers. Especially in a game like this where stealth can mean the difference between life or death.If we was playing a futuristic game with advanced optics that provide target information I wouldnt mind nametags. But were not playing that kind of game. Were playing a contempory survival horror game where we have to survive with our wits and what we scavenge. Nametags just seem unrealistic unfair and down right silly.I understand we may have nametags at the moment because of limited character customization but I feel enemy nametags will just ruin the game for me if they stay. Friendly nametags I have no problem with and would in fact welcome them. But not neutral or enemy nametags.I accept them in most MMOs mainly cos I have to but I have never liked nametags above enemy heads. In any game. And I especially dislike them in this kind of game where stealth is important.If I have no weapon and no protection available other than a bush it would seem mighty unfair if they can simply see my magical nametag floating above me allowing them to take me out with a well estimated headshot. If they dont know I am there I have a chance.From what I have read SOE wants this to be a hardcore survival game but showing enemy nametags goes against that in my opinion. I see some suggesting a no nametag ruleset which I would be ok with. Another suggestion would be to have two different nametag types maybe with different colours. Friendly nametags green above players you have befriended and Neutral nametags yellow above players who have set their status to friendly but are not in your friend list party clan etc. Any player who wishes to set themselves as unfriendly will not have a nametag. This will allow them to hide when needed and instantly shows players that this player may not want to be their friend.Anyway what ever they decide to do I hope they remove at least enemy nametags even if its only restricted to a ruleset.,h1z1,cnrgpq9,1,t5_31a08

Theres no way that theyll launch a day one early access game and everyone says yup everything is super balanced. I get people being up in arms about how broken it is but constructive feedback of this is obviously pay to win right now leads to these sorts of posts where devs respond with their intentions and what theyre doing to make it like how they envisioned. Its no fair to the devs or the players if this can be a feature that creates a bloodbath and a lot of fun gets scrapped immediately because devs dont have a chance to tweak it and make it better in an early access.,h1z1,cnrinct,4,t5_31a08

2861876,0,t3_2svb5m,I actually had a moment where my group of three teamed up with another group when we saw a mass of zombies coming at them. There was even one glorious moment. We had just finished killing all of the zombies and were talking. Their leaders name was Wolf. The three f them had nothing not a bow between the three. Myself and the two I was with were armed with bows but were down to less than ten arrows after killing. My friend Lone was watching the leader as I looked over the other two and questioned them a bit. The third in or group watched our back. Wolf was standing by the front door of a building we thought we had cleared. I just finished talking to his lackeys as I saw a Zombie about to bomb on him. I yelled Wolf get down!! He didnt hear me so I shot the arrow. It whizzed right by his head and pegged the zombie in the left eye as Lones arrow hit it in the temple. From then on out they have followed us since. ,h1z1,cnteaog,1,t5_31a08

2866597,0,t1_cntvr9w,Thats fair and I completely understand standpoint on why you and others think it isnt pay to win.  The justification of the points you addressed is completely reasonable.  Typically when we think of pay to win we think of advantages being given directly to the one who paid and that makes sense and is usually the case.However I disagree that this is the only way to look at it.  I consider any method that spawns advantage giving items into the world in exchange for money as a pay to win scenario regardless of who ultimately receives the item.  In other words paying for someone else to win is equivalently distasteful as paying for yourself to win at least in my eyes.  Again I understand how you might disagree.I feel that SoE is banking on that ambiguity of definition as to what is pay to win.  Theyre mucking around in a very grey area.  They want their microtransactions to sell well so they include advantage giving items as an enticement.  They could have easily only included cosmetics and then there would be no win component or they could have easily made these events free like Rust and then there would be no pay component.  If they did any of this there would be no question of pay to win but they didnt because the end goal is to get you to part with your dollar and guns and ammo do that best in the short term.  At the same time they dont want to appear pay to win so instead they put guns and ammo in a historically free random event and call it a gamble in order to become one step removed from the issue and to cause confusion as to what pay to win really means.,h1z1,cntxlgw,0,t5_31a08

I could probably find somewhere to drop it where nobody even sees it.  In that case its  chance of getting it.

2894294,0,t3_2t95al,The problem is that we are not sure how the loot works  they need to tell us how loot generation works in the game and we need to debate and help them adopt a more efficient system if they cant seem to get their system to work. Whats the point of this alpha if they just set it up like they want even if its flawed and not take suggestions from the community?I for one would like them to adopt a hybrid personalized loot system that spawns for a person individually that takes a bit from games like Diablo or Marvel Heroes but is lootable by others once it has been picked up or dropped. It would also take into consideration groups that travel together so they can clear a neighborhood without having to visit the same places with each person in the group. It would also save where you looted so visiting the same place in the same life would not produce as much new loot for that char. It would also save system resources by not having to spawn thousands of items everywhere for everyone. Im sure there a whole new bunch of holes or problems in my theory for loot but that should be discussed and hashed out before implementation.,h1z1,cnx32gd,3,t5_31a08

2898461,0,t3_2ta92a,Well of course they changed the suicide to respawn Guess someone got bothered by that but that is all we ever do now there is a map showing all respawn locations and  percent of them are south part of map around greenhorn road. A sleeping bag with a respawn timer of say an hour is good. If you are dying more than that...you need to take the walk to think about your mistakes. Also must be placed in a structure not in the field so they cant sleeping bag raid as cheaplyeasily.  Base building is a joke its so limited and unnecessarily complicated. And its easy to get in. I reported a massive exploit we found to raiding and they still havent addressedacknowledged it. It really shocks me that with all the great feautres and things this game has done though that they put so little effort into base building over the last  months. Especially when their predecessors  days and Rust did an amazing job with the crafting. Maybe the guy who designs this part of game needs to go play those two. Graphics are absolutely amazing on ultra especially when they fix the lighting a little better.

And I dont even like it that much especially when people push me to this kind of playstyle and then treat me like a dick if I kill them.So yeah I just log in after patches to loot and shoot zombies and then wait to the next patch basically or I play like I have nothing to lose because honestly thats the case right now,h1z1,co0ij7x,1,t5_31a08

I got shit for having my gamma set higher because my monitor is a very old and dark screen.  So I set it back to default because if the game is intended to be played with unadjusted gamma thats how ill play it.  Im pretty sure that using duped ammo is not how the game is intended to be played.

2934518,0,t1_co1kcxb,I couldnt agree more Meurto.  This is exactly how stuff would go down.  People bring in humanity this and that the fact is humanity will likely win in the long run.  But hit the ground running people are savage in situations where survival is a commodity.    I dont think systems should be in place via game mechanics. If people want things to be humane in a PVP environment then communize as a server and make it happen. Then they can create their own governing bodies and justifypenalize any rulesetmoraldecisions that they wish.  The majority wins pack mentality.

You were warned about glitches bugs errors lack of balance etc. If you bought this looking for a fun playable experience you should have read before you bought.That said i rarely experience dupers. Ive faced shot gun users who put  rounds down range easy. Does that make them dupers? No. Ammo is easy to get which is an issue but i never would accuse them of duping. When you get killed its easy to try to find something else to blame be it dupers hackers lag bugs etc.Am i saying dupers and hackers dont exist?

2945115,0,t3_2tv1jn,Im glad to see all the attention to loot balance by SOE however Im not sure therell ever be a perfect setting for it.  Frankly everyone has different ideas on what the loot frequencyqualityamount should be.  Some want it to be rare others plentiful. You cant please  of the people.  An idea that came across my mind would be that since there are so many servers there could be a server setting for how much loot there is to be had.  Some might have a more hardcore experience with less loot while others offer more for a more relaxed experience.  I dunno. just a thought.,h1z1,co2vfv0,1,t5_31a08

2945351,0,t3_2tw8t9,Just an FYI the vehicles can occasionally fall right through the floor.We tried something similar to make a secure garage and things went...poorly.Also watch out for trolls with storage containersfurnacesBarbecues that block your gate off as a lot of placed player containers do not have durability and cant be destroyed.,h1z1,co2wer4,5,t5_31a08
2945490,0,t1_co2wl3l,Well for example in HZ you have a health bar that decides whether you are alive or dead by containing a value equal to or hopefully above .In DayZ you have energy blood bone spine hydration and temperature stats as well as an unconscious state. These different modifiers affect your character within an intricate balance of the stats and can be replenished and depleted by more complex means as well.Sure in both games simple bleeding is cured by a bandage. However in DayZ a broken bone requires a splint low blood requires a transfusion or saline bag administration. Low energy can result in unconciousness as well as high damage and the amount of damage needed to cause a player to be rendered unconscious depends on their energy level.Granted this example only explores the medical system in both games however it serves as a great example as to how DayZ is more involved. This involvement might be at the expense or to the benefit of the general gameplay experience however. Thats a matter of opinion. ,h1z1,co2wza7,2,t5_31a08

2953169,0,t3_2tzjm0,Its pretty doubtable that they would want to keep player interaction to a minimum maybe that was misinterpreted as KOS to a minimum? as they have changed how server pops are displayed to evenout player population plus theres a  player limit on a map that is  the size of the DayZ map which has  player limits. They are also going to increase the map but they will also increase the player limit per server as they do so. If they didnt want people to play together they would have made a singleplayer game. From my standpoint HZ is already a different game from DayZ. This subreddit has gotten more love from the devs than DayZ ever did they openly support suggestions to make a bigger better game and have multiple ways for players to submit them their road map forums this subreddit the issue tracker and lets not forget the fact that theres more less broken zombies in HZ than DayZ has ever had  ,h1z1,co3sfae,2,t5_31a08

2954382,0,t3_2tymoe,I dont build the structures I find a house that is strategic and fortify it. I know there is no way to keep players out so i make it either as stealthy as possible or as discouraging as I can.  Flood the place with punji sticks and snares with a clever parkour system to navigate the maze. ANDOR place my containers in such a way that unless you know its there. you are VERY likely to miss them entirely! The layout of the houses allows some pretty neat placements. Best part is it works great against zombies and wolves allowing me to farm them without ever being in harms way or wasting a shot arrow or otherwise  its also server wipe ready  minimizes loss and down time while rebuilding and there is no jumping over my walls cause i have a roof!,h1z1,co3xeeq,1,t5_31a08

2954757,0,t1_co3yomg,Read the Dev tracker watch their twitch streams. You think that they have time to just come and answer every individual question from millions of players? I know just from a glance that they think the loot is to much. Common sense man. They adjusted loot rates to high without fixing the bug that let them spawn. Then when they fixed the bug that stop the spawning the loot rates were still set on high creating higher then normal loot.,h1z1,co3yxo9,1,t5_31a08

2956411,0,t1_co3u09u,This exactly. If you just want to jump on and play for a bit you should be able to gear up. Im not saying you should have ars. But you should be able to create a framed backpack or find one and enough water and food for a few days in game. Firearm deterioration is fine. It shouldnt break just need cleaning or misfire. ,h1z1,co45pwh,1,t5_31a08

2957927,0,t3_2tv1jn,Too much loot. Its nice to see the respawns are fixed or mostly fixed. But respawn rates are now too high. I could loot cars  times on roughly  minutes.  metal sheet some cloth  binoculars this are way too common now imo I had never seen them before yesterdays patch All this in the same  cars offroad near a firecamp.To make it clear we made a entire new base deck foundation  walls metal gate and large shelter amp  shelters inside BBQ Furnace and Dew colector and moved all the stuff loot from a older base previously attacked.ALL in  hours not really making much of an effort killing zombies bears and wolfs some friendly encounters. We were three guys running around making this base. We had so much spare time we joined the KoS fest in UnPleasant Valley.Killed  guys each of them had  bullets of one or  kind. We lost a guy he respawned and on his way back he found cap orange backpack a lot of food and a handgun   bullets. It feels like preapocaliptic. There is stuff in every corner. We even tested IEDs and landmines with my fists! more testing is needed xDOpinion making metal  items a commonish thing is fun because crafting makes the world feel alive and I love it. Making gunsammo and food a common thing makes people Kill on Sight war City building capture game And we already have Planetside for that matter.Too many killing and surviving resources make the game experience oversimplified.It was a pretty fun day to play tho.Idea Use this loot respawn rate on a few servers with testing purposes such as item functionality bugs related issues etc. Since testing this stuff is hard with a  low respawn rate.Not relatedto loot Shotgun is OP.

Also consider building decoys around your base like small shelter or dig a hole where you place your thing instead of in your base. People will raid the big base instead of the small shelter nor they will look for a tiny hole you digged.People only tend see what they want to see. A big base near a small shelter? Lets go for the bigger fish!Dont forget the location of your base is the most important aspect. Open field base is good on one hand in terms of active defending but too many people will notice your base. A base in the woods will help you greatly decieving people.,h1z1,co6oro0,1,t5_31a08

2979670,0,t1_co6rvvt,And the reason? ALPHA!Its alpha so they do not implement a lot of zombies. That will stress the servers unneccessarily. This is the problem with people having access to games in Alpha stage they will play it as it is a normal game. IT IS NOT A FREAKING FINISHED GAME. You are playing a very simplistic testing version of the game in order to help develop the games. Whining about omg the zombies are no threat shows that you do not understand the meaning of why you are able to play now. Same with DayZ. that game is not even in Beta stage.

2983053,0,t3_2ub4h8,They need to increase the size of the world ASAP. They said they were going to do it right away but it hasnt happened obviously.More players will be let in simultaneously as the world size increases but the current area has  players per square kilometer at server cap.  Thats too high especially considering Smedley said something about not wanting players to always see others while running around.  Well just have to wait for the world to open up.Loot... It needs to be decreased by a large amount.  The respawn is just way too quick and floods the game.  I run back and forth between a few spots and respawn is happening in  minutes for most containers while ish minutes is the most for the rest.  Respawn should be in the  minute range.As far as zombies... Not sure what the beef is.  Our base always has some outside.  Our stash area is a magnet and its actually pretty monotonous.  We cant look in out stashes for more than  seconds before a zombie or two starts attacking.  As I said in another thread I think the issue is that the zombies seem to be spread out evenly from each other.  Go out to a large open field and look for zombies. They are  yards from each other in all directions so it creates a generic traditional mob spacing type of scenario.  It doesnt feel right and also makes larger scale PvP a pain at times because there isnt much open space.  Zombies need to spawn with wider random spacing inbetween each other and also group up here and there hordes. Open space isnt a bad thing. ,h1z1,co76tel,1,t5_31a08

2983638,0,t1_co717wa,The general disconnect happens when people buy a game like Dayz or hz to live play out their rick grimes fantasies only to find that these early access games are mostly talk about zombie survival but no actual capability to provide the necessary scale that the zombie genre requires.   These games are taking advantage of the popularity of zombies but the underlying games never seem to emphasize the zombie threat that would actually lead to the conditions the games take place in.  I personally think Garry ditched zombies in Rust because he realized it couldnt be done properly.   I still very much doubt hz engine is capable of more than  actors rendered much less spawn and control a zombie horde that would be capable of destroying a single squad of marines.  I am just thinking the concept is never going to work as hoped and I would rather see them just abandon zombies and make them mutants or something else aliens? so they can have small amounts of these things be absolutely devastating.

The more chance you lose something the less you see killing also if you really want to stopKOS fucking make zombies the bad guys in every zombie game zombies are like the  fun puppet to kill if they would be on mass and be a big threat may aswell become stronger or even attack your base you just wouldnt have time to fuck with players.Also food and drink should be rare but I shouldnt like almost be dead after  minutes of not drinkingeat.

3005166,0,t3_2ukbkb,I was thinking of something similar.  Think of the tiers for healing for example.  You have a bandage which provides basic healing.  Then you can craft saline and combine that with a bandage for a first aid kit.  For guns you could use a cloth and a wire to craft a makeshift cleaning patch.  Something like this  Maybe require some purified water to make sure the cloth is cleaned.  That could be the bandage part of your cleaning kit and would bring back some durability to your weapon.  Combine that with other items like lubricant and solvents and you would have a full fledged weapon cleaning kit.  Regular cleaning of your weapon will maintain its durability and prevent jamming.  This brings me to the idea of jammed weapons.  A tool kit would be required to disassemble those and clean them properly.   Maybe these ideas are too realistic for the game.  I believe weapon cleaning would be something that would really increase the immersion.  An opportunity to build an emotional connection with your weapon is there.  ,h1z1,co9hex8,1,t5_31a08

That way itll be an actual construction site and an arduous process that will take time and attract attention  including zombies since the process will be quite noisy.  Regardless the current system is definitely just a temporary one just to fill the alpha void and occupy players with something  thats what the developers said.

If you dont have enough space for your car battery and your food youve got some decisions to make. If you find a dead body on the side of the road you have to decide whats the most important thing to take knowing full well that youll be leaving plenty of valuable equipment at the side of the road for your potential enemies.I even like the fact that cupboards have a finite storage space. When I build a base I really have to decide what goes where and whats important to me. And carry the best stuff on my person.The fact that you could lose all the stuff you stole is a balancing factor as well. I love that a guy who has everything dies just as easily from an arrow to the head as the fresh spawn.I like being at work and not knowing if my stuff is safe. Dont get me wrong.

We had one of each vehicle and we noticed the cop car is faster and the truck uses gas slightly faster. This means that if the offroader we didnt test this is actually better at offroading then each car has specific perks. The truck you can shoot out of cop car for speed and chasing and the offroader for getting to crazy places.

I got fucking plugged by gunmen nonstop all last night and today before I get more than a backpack I get plugged while trying to be chill or end up gang raped by a pack of noobs with bows so they can loot my berries and wood sticks....All communication falls on deaf ears. I tried just shredding my shirt making a bow when I spawned to kill zombies away from population areas for a chance at some loot I killed like at most  in a hour because I cant fucking find more than  ever fucking  minutes and no loot....Before the wipe I was able to go out in the wild and plug zombies for loot every  kills even if it was like cloth but now I kill them and they most likely poof before I can run up to them.I might be in the minority hear but fuck I wanted to play all night and drink but its not fun for me ,h1z1,codn219,1,t5_31a08

3048120,0,t3_2v2qe8, There are actually allot of players who want the game to stay buy to play after launch to cut down on the number of hackersscripters. this will ensure more funding for the Devs create more attachment to the game for players amp reduce the amount of stuff that needs to be bought after you start playing If groups get big they are bound to have fractures of internal strife. If they dont they will likely get bored. Your somewhat right on number . Once they get zombies properly implemented along with the virus then gun spawns will need to be much more reflective of the fact the game is set in the Midwest US only a couple months after the zombie outbreak.Otherwise they will have to tone down the zombies due to mass cries.Ammo on the other hand is more or less alright considering the number of gun types currently in game only  if it were much higher people would KOS all the time. As I said above though once they properly implement zombies the virus amp a much wider variety of guns then they will likely need to do a rebalance of gun amp ammo spawns.,h1z1,codxq9r,1,t5_31a08

Use stairs and put them  stacked on each other so that they block the way up.

It will also mitigate the hoarding of weapons by players if they make them deteriorate over time without use as well.

Which is fine but yes guns are nice and the player base wants them.. If youre on a PvE server I have no idea what good a gun is as a bow will kill anything quite easily.

3076657,0,t3_2vdqh5,remove stackable k but Id love it if you make them snappable. connect platforms side by side.Also fix rotation so fiddly placement rules do not ALWAYS reset the stairsdoorwayfurnace opening or whatever to point away from you. I hates that I do.gt Biggest change is collision rules. No object overlapping anymore. Also no stacking small items like rabbit traps and furnaces.My read is stacking ! overlapping and stacking changes apply to small items. I would assume foundations are large items. Perhaps placing punji sticks can prevent griefers from putting a furnace to block your door. Well have to see it in action to really understand it though.,h1z1,cogw60x,2,t5_31a08

It sucks terribly that these people got laid off and the best of luck to them. I hope all the young ones on here take note for there careers and continously improve yourself and look to always add great value. It wont prevent lay offs but it can help avoid one.

Once they figure out what hacks people are using and build something to combat it hackers will be rarer. PS has virtually no hackers.

If you get queued over  and dont get in in  seconds you are not in and can press cancel better luck next time. You have to be REALLY FAST to catch these but once you have an account made to a server you can just next time select it with your mouse and you can basically then join with  clicks...All in all for me the normal game sucks balls made out of dog shit its a shit BR match basically and the BR is only mildly interesting. ,h1z1,colmvi4,-2,t5_31a08

They teleport short distances at a time which will appear to be extremely similar to false positives caused by anything from lag to flying through the air or on the ground at high speeds after jumping out of a vehicle falling a long distance etc.With anticheat systems you need to be absolutely positive that it receives no false positives. In a game with a physics system like this it becomes very difficult to determine what is legitimate movement and what is not because the speeds you can achieve through normal play can be very high.,h1z1,comdkns,0,t5_31a08

How is that any different than hacking to most lol. You are just abusing your group size to ensure you lose as little farm as possible.When private servers exist where people actually police them on an individual basis all of these problems vanish until then people are going to hack and bads are going to group up into large groups.That is just how these games go if you are new to the genre.,h1z1,conjper,-6,t5_31a08

Making suggestions and providing feedback is an important part of this process however the idea that the devs can simply throw a few switches dial a few knobs and type out some code and Bam its fixed is extraordinarily unrealistic. Hype is subjective the only groups of people sensationalizing and grand standing are people under the impression theyre participating in a PreTrail game.

I used it two times throughout the day. I ran around and knew exactly where my enemy was. It was stupid. There was absolutely nothing fun about it except knowing where people were which I see no fun from. It was fucking boring as shit. I dont see the fun in this crap like these idiots do.

3205359,0,t3_2wrp51,Nice video. This is the type of situation a lot of people in this forum reddit whatever keep telling me wont happen in HZ and all I say is... Just wait.  When the world expands and more simultaneous players are allowed into the servers this will be normal gameplay. Throw in a player economy that makes clanspeople want to control areas for resources... Its going to be fun. I cant wait.On the other hand this is exactly why all structures need to be much much stronger. Melee shouldnt hurt metal and should only do very little damage to wood gameplay gt real life. If the defenders were asleep or only had  people online for this raid every piece of that base could have been destroyed in  minutes or less. That directly conflicts with the developers wanting persistence to be important and for players to be able to build a Woodbury per Smedley. It looked like the attacking clan was naked raiding so their risk was very low. If they all die which they did their care meter will be almost nonexistent. I assume they mostly brought resources to craft melee weapons with. Thats why base structures need to be a whole lot stronger. People cannot play  to defend against large groups playing in a low risk way knocking down a gate in  minutes then destroying whatever else they feel like in a very short period of time if defenders are offline.  Wait until more people are let in... Clans will be bigger and alliances will form to create even bigger battles. With structures in their current form bases would be destroyed even more quickly. Changes to structure resistance and melee damage need to be made for better gameplay. ,h1z1,cou8gos,17,t5_31a08

3219485,0,t3_2wx23h,The game might support further render range if it wasnt catered to the consoles and casuals. They have to remove potentially Laggy features so it will run smoothly on the consoles and old PCs. If they made the game  with rendering it would put a strain on most casual gaming rigs and would cut their profit margins by excluding that market from their game because their PCs cant handle it. But by leaving in the ability to adjust your graphics in such a way that it actually improves your visibility is by no means a good design practice either.It would be awesome to see further render ranges but I dont think its going to be in the cards considering this is being marketed like I said to casual gamers with old PCs and consoles. It would be nice if they would force a minimum settings requirement to give everyone a standard of graphics that looks as best as possible while offering the most optimized experience for the largest demographic they can. It might be that not everyone has a PC to run the game  but the game shouldnt sacrifice its quality just so it can be playable on more peoples PCs.,h1z1,covpa46,1,t5_31a08

At most we keep about  vehicles as we arent about to start our own used car lot weve seen as many as  in one place during our search. Since the last wipe weve not seen a single Police Car. We suspect that people have placed or are placing foundations or other items in spawn locations to prevent vehicles from spawning.

Im not saying that people who play with hackers are not dickbags but they are not breaking the terms of service. So SoEDBG cant do anything about it also it would be really hard to prove it. When you report a hacker they look at the data values to see where when and with what he killed you. They are not looking at a videos of what happened most of the time unless you were recording an you sent it with the email.

3317668,0,t3_2y4mnu,I appreciate what youre saying in this post but these things are not entirely correct. It is true that its hard to tell the difference between lagging and noclipping but in the end its about making sure were confident that the person we kick andor ban was actually no clipping. This requires time and testing which we are actively doing right now.The client does do collision detection and so does the server. They share tasks and were working out kinks in how they report to each other.Theres a lot of talk about how theres nothing being verified on the server and this is just straight up false. Theres a bunch of stuff the client calculates and bunch of stuff the server also calculates. Due to latency they are not always in agreement with the client. Well strictly speaking the client and the server are never truly in sync in any online game.The point with this is to make sure that he decisions the server makes are fair to both players involved in combat or to the player performing actions on their own.Your comment about locked containers is good but were looking at some bugs with locks and codes right now that prevent this from working correctly.In the end its frustrating because the more information we give you the legitimate players about what were doing to combat cheating ALSO give the cheat developers good information about how to avoid the anticheat measures. Right now we keep much of that internal.,h1z1,cp6fxt2,22,t5_31a08

3327404,0,t1_cp7iv1u,This game has many issues and people are in denial whenever others point them out. I wont be surprised when your post is downvoted to oblivion. Ive personally given up on this game since day  when they lied about cosmetics being only purchasable item. When they are not the only thing you can buy in game.  If I had millions of dollars and  lawyers I would sue Daybreak SOE and Steam for false advertisement. But we are off topic now. So let me redirect before this becomes another its not pw post. Its obvious they have many issues. And people expecting to play this game is ridiculous. Not the fact that its Early Access but the fact that this is a prealpha buildBare bones. So the only ones being victimized are the ones choosing to play this game as if its complete.  Since I wont be seeing my  again. Ive chosen to approach the game in more of as a beta tester. Though there are more then enough people to point out the obvious bugs I just come on see if anything changed and if I felt that it hasnt I just log right back off because Ive experienced one hacker attack and one was enough. And the amount of hackers on this game is more then any other prealpha Early Access game Ive ever seen before. This could be because people feel cheated out of there money or some are just doing cause they can which is more likely. So in conclusion nobody is being victimized cause they are victimizing themselves by choosing to play a prealpha build with no security.  Thus not playing the game would simply save you a lot of grief and suffering till the issue is and will be obviously fixed. Making all of the post about hacking irrelevant which is why they do not reply to any of these kinda threads. Alot of people have left including me but they will come back because well there are simply no other games to play at the moment. Despite being lied and cheating too. ,h1z1,cp7jv74,-1,t5_31a08

Same as usual apart from this time the door to his base was wide open.We all equip a wrench and start smashing down his large shelter.You think you got a motherload? There were  crates just assigned to shotguns with a total of over  rounds.  crates for ARs over  rounds.  container for hunting rifle and  for pistols.  crate also full of backpacks.Ive never seen so many berries before either...There was  container each assigned to turbos headlights batteries and spark plugs guess what? There was a pickup truck under his base too Guess what I proceeded to do... I fill up the truck with all the shotgun ammo and as many shotguns as it can carry like  or so?. Bear in mind this was veeshans peak pre st server wipe trucks are hard enough to drive now let alone before their first handling fix.My friend says dude be careful i hear cars are really hard to drive in this game its literally my first time in a vehicle with all working parts...Palms sweating hearts racing from all the excitement of this motherload i hit a bump.... Car flips.... Sliding down mountain... friends are all shouting at me to jump out I jump out as the car hits a tree. Its on fire i think OH NO THE GUNS and get back in to at least take the ammo...

We had made  separate garages and kept  cars in each we dropped off a car quickly with the other  without checking and it wiggled its way down the hill and started destroying all the other cars somehow By morning there was only one truck remaining at ish energy... After that we only put  cars per garage D Also using a deck foundation  shelters and  furnaces makes a more secure garage. Make sure the deck foundation is set at about the height of the cars to prevent flipping bug. Barb wire goes down too easy and can be bugged over easily ,h1z1,cpa0bjv,2,t5_31a08

3358233,0,t3_2ymu0u,having written hacks for many a video game including this one i guess i can provide some insight? maybe...this solution could work but it wouldnt be the first attempt... it was attempted in DayZ Standalone at one point. but it was a colossal failure and was removed because it was the reason there was so much rubberbanding. you know when people would randomly fall to their deaths rofl.Im not entirely sure how stable the clientserver architecture is but it could be very much possible.HOWEVER ... i personally do not think their interest lies in placing inhouse anticheating functionality. seeing as HZ is going to be pushed into a fp game theyre going to follow the same path that planetside has. that being an intense HWID authorization system and massive harvesting of every public cheat available. now this may sound cheap or perhaps lazy but really this isnt necessarily a bad thing if done correctly it could severely cut down the amount of hackers in the game by a significant margin.tldr hz is fp and will probably follow what ps has done in regards to anticheating HWID banning and public cheat detection not designated inengine anticheating functionality.,h1z1,cpb2ak2,1,t5_31a08

If the Devs could create a constallation that would show up in the sky directly north. It would show up as a semitransparent N or some other symbol. This would have a cool naturalistic control to the overall lack of direction you expieriance when spawning with nothing at night. Look up see which way is north and tredd accordingly.The day time method might be to look at the direction the sun is heading west to east if that aspect was lined up properly.

Try hip firing with a . at  yards then do it while aiming down the sights. Youll notice a difference in accuracy AND precision. There is a reason guns are designed with iron sights and a javelins are not. Speaking of javelins your examples provided are not hip firing... Hip firing applies to shooting a gun.

Prepaid cards with a VisaMastercard logo are accepted pretty much everywhere so depending on their payment processor and contracts it wouldnt be as easy as oh we just dont take those now. I mean maybe it would stop the casual hacker asshole but the problem ones are the ones that are  happy to throw down  dollars in a month to keep buying keys and such.

Zombies were never much more than a nuisance prior to the increase but after it I found myself getting stranded inside houses fearing for my life totally surrounded. The respawn issues were a problem because you would kill  zombies and there would be  more instantly in your path.

The fact is that just like you and myself when we group up of time it will be with people that speak the same language as us. The persons race ethnisity have NOTHING to do w who is running hags. Furthermore as stated by another replyESP does not give the ablity to grab items they cant access that would require a pulling process to be written and you can rest assured only a very small minority of ESP users in any game know how to code. And lastly this entire idea is a waste of to for reasons stated above but primarily for the fact that if you understood how games function you see that hiding a players name would only make ur virtual life harder because it woudl only be hidening from you and if the dogsh!t about hag users specifcly being Asian and them needing to groupup were trueWHICH IT IS NOT then they could simplelyadd a read PLAYERID process to there code and have it display considering its all located at that address anyway.TLDR Dont generalize and make assumptions based on what you know very little about. I know this type of stuff is frustrating and we all want to find a way to fix it. but whether you realized it or not linking this to race is dangerous and we already fought one real world war of it lets not start a virtual one too. ,h1z1,cq4m1c7,-7,t5_31a08

3628140,0,t1_cq5r10w,No problem. We differ on a very important aspect though. You want zombies to be spawned and directed towards players. That means a player is guaranteed to acquire aggro no matter what they do once the zombie cap you suggested tilts their way. Player choice and situational awareness is thrown out of the window.  I prefer the complete opposite. I want zombies to spawn for the world not the player. The  yard nospawn player radius provides that. The different heat radii distances around players and random roaming for zombies provides aggro threat but also allows player choice based on situational awareness firearms  yards sightchopstructurevehicle repair  yards. Sometimes people make the wrong choice out of lack of observation andor bad luck. Other times they may need to make a necessary choice that puts themselves at risk. Need that loot in PV? The POI heat radius will make it risky with regard to zombies. Getting into a firefight  while in PV will make it much more dangerous since POI heat spawns a denser amount of zombies.Need that loot at the campsite in the wilderness and dont see zombies within the  yard sight heat radius? Youre good to go. But oops... Did zombies that randomly roamed closer to you from the edge of the  yard nospawn player radius encroach the sight heat radius while you were looting? Aggro. Did the radius of another player spawn zombies at the campsite before you got there? Better clear them out if you want the loot.Standing in one spot for  hours? No guaranteed zombies. They might roam in from the nospawn edge or they might not. Random pathing. Firing off your gun when no zombies are within  yards? No aggro.Your clan of  getting into a firefight at your base in wilderness against another group at ? No guaranteed aggro. Its probably likely aggro because players would be moving around causing zombies spawned at the edges of player radii single or overlapping to fall with the  yard firearm heat radius but not a guarantee. Thats where the situational awareness observation choice good luck and bad luck comes into play. But... Its all driven by the player not an AI Director. I would guess your preference wins out though. The spawn system already runs along those lines.What I dont want a guarantee of happening the following type of situation would even happen in the wilderness predam patchThe player on the ground had no choice after the fight started. He couldnt observe. He couldnt use situational awareness to prevent that from happening. The game just spawned zombies near him in order to aggro. The current system and your suggestion guarantees that happening because its directed by the spawn mechanic.But by a stroke of luck DGC changes pace and this will happenP,h1z1,cq5u3ek,1,t5_31a08

And anyway you can only use airdrops on high population servers which are very few and full of hackers. The only reason Id give for not buying it is hackers.

You show up with your fleet shoot the structure to  shields which will reinforce the structure making it invulnerable and also starting a timer set by the defending team which will determine when the structure will become vulnerable again so both sides have the option to show up and fight. Not sure how you could make a system like this fit into HZ. It would likely at the very least need to be a server specific feature. But the option of actually being able to defend or the possibility meeting resistance would make the game so much more fun.,h1z1,cqodjhc,1,t5_31a08

3794005,0,t3_33v3x0,I prone in the grass when they pop out and they lose track of me. but deff yes something has to be done when they are going super fast. Either have them tuck and roll when they are at certain speeds or they take dmg upon getting out and a staggered effect as they hit the ground. TOP speeds should really hurt someone getting out.this should make players slow down indicating they want to get out and fight.Adding in animations of entering and getting out of cars would be nice but I dont think they would do that at this stage of the game.,h1z1,cqoqwmc,2,t5_31a08

3805473,0,t1_cqq0ydq,Look at the official planetside forum for Server Miller EU. It started over a year ago. But between January and March it got really worse for the gamer. People got pings way over . ms. This short video shows only a ping of  ms. You can imagine that playing with  ms isnt playable anymore.DBG knows about the problems specially with the EU servers since a long time. But the only thing the did was talking and hidding the ping ingame to calm down people. Updates that should fix the problems didnt do much. It was just a short time scratch on the surface. And so most people still suffering under a high ping on EU server. I see the same thing happening now on HZ. Flying vehicles strange behavior of npcs laggin while in the near of buildings or other players. DBG needs definitly better server.  ,h1z1,cqq1yti,1,t5_31a08

Placing it on top of the building would require dozens of stacked players to access them. However placing them on top means that the storage containers would not be secure inside a locked building. Not like it matters much since hackers simply magic bullet the doors off anyway. Only a hacker can gain easy access to the containers. Simply comes down to personal opinion on that matter. ,h1z1,cqtrw27,1,t5_31a08

3842309,0,t3_34atkj,Here is my idea for base building and raidsWith the new patch other players will not be able to construct stuff near someones base. That is awesome and will prevent stupid invasions. Now everybody will have to break the gates or walls to get in.But still as long as we have breakable structures it doesnt matter if it takes min or  hours to break it. If you dont play with a clan to protect the base  you will get raided once you log out. Every minute you are offline there is a chance that a new player spots your base and tries to break it until someone do that by using brute force. It is like a websites password. If you allow brute force you will get hacked you just dont know when. That is why they give you only  chances to type your password right without blocking your account to mitigate brute force attacks. I think you people get what Im trying to say.So here is my idea to make this game more interesting creating motive to play it and smart conflicts without removing breakable structures and raids!  We need a new box crate probably a safe that is unbreakable.  Only the owners of this safe can access it with a password.  You have to use it or repair it. If you dont do that in  week for example it will be unlocked for everybody.So lets imagine this  You log out and a bunch of players break your gate and raid your base.  They will have your place but wont be able to open or break your safe.  If they want the items in the safe they will have to prevent its owners to use or repair it for at least one week.  If the owner wants the items back he will have one week or so to take his base back and reach the safe.With this we will generate a cool raid war between those two groups. If you really want to raid someone you will have to take it earn it and KEEP it! You will have to fight for it until the safe gets unlocked. And the owner will still have a chance to take his stuff back and a motive to play the game and fight back with his friends!I dont know if this kind of idea was already discussed. If not what do you think?,h1z1,cqu99lb,2,t5_31a08

It took you guys at least a week of planning to troll our base but all we need to troll you is a . rifle and a pistol. At the end of the day it only took me about an hour to destroy your lettering repair my base and regear. All the phat loot you took was the stuff we stole from Lances base that we didnt have enough bag space to log out with. I highly doubt you guys will be able to do much with it in the  day before the wipe anyway. ,h1z1,cqudcny,1,t5_31a08

Folks have been building a ring of shacks around the bottom of their deck foundation as a garage of sorts with two shacks spaced far enough apart and the doors ajar yet its pretty simple to just close them and snatch the vehicle.Perhaps theres a chance that there has been random periods of time where they were like this and it was unintended but Ive been able to do this many times dating back to January.,h1z1,cqxm0t0,0,t5_31a08

I enjoy h a great deal but some of the worst issues that need to be addressed are the speed hacking problem flashbangsnadesmollys being unthrowable and cant be picked up from the floor if dropped but mainly the hacking problem. I bought the game for  of my friends and we enjoy playing it a great deal but even though we have numbers we are unable to move as a unit or enter a city wo seeing a hacker tearing it up. Its an amazing feelinggame playing with all your friends and doing loot runs but hackers really take all that away as soon as one guy warping takes out  fully armedarmored people.

3922555,0,t3_35dfb7,Items that you cant get anywhere else except for airdrops but arent geared towards PvP so that nobody feels like they need an airdrop to compete.A great example of this is the Waist Pack. Getting a Waist Pack from an airdrop feels goodrewarding and its not an edge in PvP. They help a lot when you combine them with a Green Camo Military Backpack for moving things either from one base to another carrying ethanolbiofuel gathering all of your corn in one go etc.Thats the kind of thing you should be aiming the airdrops at. Things that are useful and cool but dont give a clear required advantage.Some other ideas for items in this ballpark Base building decorationsstructures Base building blueprints that unlock a new and unique recipe. Hiking Backpack holds  weight? Unique aesthetic storage container Treasure box steel crate golden ottoman? Unique farming seeds Watermelon seeds true potato seeds cotton seeds watermelon bombs vodka and a recipe for scraps of cloth anyone? Premium fertilizer increase speed of crop growth even further than that of regular fertilizer Unique Melee Weapons Katana Brass Knuckles Mourning Star Bolas for hunting animals Unique placeable hazards moat shovel for digging a moat maybe it has  charges per shovel?  sink hole kit shotgun tripwire etc Unique animal traps mouse traps?Basically there is a lot to the game that exists outside of PvP that a lot of people enjoy doing. Not only that but these activities are very valuable and the people participating would love extra goodies to work with.EDIT Also the population issue must be addressed. Allow everyone to drop them on any population server. People pay for them. Let them use them where they play!,h1z1,cr3eobv,122,t5_31a08

3932708,0,t1_cr4jr4t,Sometimes I feel the same way which is why I have no intention of putting anymore money into the game until I see real progress.ESP is the biggest problem in a game like this. If they cant solve it the game will die a slow death.And simple stuff too... Like why on earth would you send the client a players name at render time if the players name cant be seem beyond a few meters away.  I understand WHY less load on the server but in a game like this where there is a real impact to dying or will be at some point you cant use the same techniques from the average FPS where an average lifespan is  seconds.I hope DGC learns this before its too late.,h1z1,cr4kb82,0,t5_31a08

3935793,0,t1_cr4iwd8,At the end of the day though I am arguing against free to play versus any other business model in this case. What I am getting at is even if the game is free to play if the game turns out to be shit people wont pay for it anyway or support the company. Whether it is just microtransactions or whether it is early access or box price or box price and sub. The point I am trying to make is that it doesnt matter what model you have if you have a successful game your company should be somewhat successful given the relative term. If the game is unsuccessful and you cannot generate a good enough amount of revenue to stay open you would go under anyway. This is also why crowd funding early access etc have taken off. In the case of crowd funding and early access if the game is shit they will have spent their budget anyway or most of it by the time people realize this. Salariesbenefits bills such as electric bill hardware computers cost building space contracting etc. So in any case it wouldnt matter what path they take to finance their game. If it turns out to be shit they would go under anyway. Edit In the case of crowd funding and early access it just opens the door to smaller places to create a game without a publisher or other financing options in most cases. In the case of early access they still must have a working mostly working product in place for it to even be put on Steam. So something would have needed to be created for early access whereas crowd funding to start could start with an idea alone... maybe some artwork or a few videos.. lol. gtThe massive costs involved and the frequency of failure has made the game industry one of the most unstable and hostile work environments in the US. That is kind of their own fault. They hire inexperienced people or they hire through the revolving door. You have many devs programmers and designers who are in the positions they are in because of how many years they have been in the gaming industry. It doesnt mean they are quality developers it just means they come at a high price. Look at Holinka Main PvP Dev for WoW right now. Holinka can basically be seen as a complete failure for the content that is under his belt Ghostcrawler is basically a saint compared to what Holinka has designed. That is more of the issue with the gaming industry. When you release a AAA game or any successful game you are considered a good game developer. Your ideas could be shit but if you shipped a game that is one notch on your belt. That is one of the main reasons the gaming industry is in the problems it is in. That revolving door can sometimes hit you.Even DGC then SOE had very similar issues Id hope they still dont have these same policies. You had people who were promoted based on seniority alone and not a mix of merit and seniority. You usually dont promote and hire based solely on who someone is or how many AAA titles they have released. Most industries hire and promote based off of merit as the number  quality. Are they qualified for the job or not is usually the first thing that gets looked at. The fact that the gaming industry has a revolving door and hires and promotes based off of who they are and not the content they have put out should speak more. I am sure not all gaming companies do this but the overwhelming majority do.,h1z1,cr4wykt,1,t5_31a08
3937106,0,t3_35jrf4,Unfortunately I think that making metal doors stronger would overall hurt group raiding as once you get past the gate you need to get past the metal doors as well in most cases.  Theyre pretty durable with ethanol imo but biofuel should be toned down to the same level as ethanol.  I think I counted something like  biofuel to fully take down a metal door... thats way too low given you can acquire that many in about an hour of farming.A suggestion I could give is to create a ground tamper with walls and a gate then place your shacks inside of it.  The amount of farming would be significantly less than for a fullfetched base while gaining some security.Have you checked what type of fuelhow many was used near the door?

You focus on making your money off cosmetics like many fp games do successfully such as Dota  and Team Fortress .  Airdrops should only contain items that benefit everything pertaining to survival with the exception of PvP related items.

3955059,0,t3_35rg5f,The devs have stated theyre thinking about adding this to the Humanity Server when it comes out.I think it would be really cool.  Maybe you put ingame items up as a reward.  So you want to put a bounty on BubbaTheSerialKiller and you put  shotgun rounds into the bounty box with a description of where he hangs out and what he looks like.  If someone kills them it pops up ingame that they can go claim their rewards at the bounty box or maybe it pops up and the items just drop in your backpack or his loot bag.If they had that bounty system with account bound items that would change things dramatically.  Whoever gets a Jinx Mourning Wood or HZ Beanie put on them is pretty much guaranteed to get killed ASAP....lolAlthough the system wouldnt be without problems.  What if they change their name?

Maybe because there is no magical system that allows survivors to rly know if someone is good or evil. The only organizations remaining are just groups of survivors that trust each other and need to watch their backs. It would take away from the zombie survival game genre to add a bountyboard.

It also allows it to decay in between weekly patches if not used that week.Ive found plenty of bases already with vehicles that never move and I just watch the structures decay around it until server restarts and the structure HP is reset. The base owner obviously doesnt play anymore and that vehicle has been removed from circulation. This is on a lowpop PvE server btw where most people jumped on after the wipe to make a base stash a car and then never play again.,h1z1,crdybg6,2,t5_31a08

And if it went into the core game depending on where you drop in there is alot of bases that can result in you getting hungup on them and falling to your death or landing in a base and not being able to get out or just plain glitchdying or clipping through walls and ending up inside buildings.It would take a huge amount of work to get this to actually work perfectly and even then it still would be flawed to a degree considering my above example where bases are concerned.There will always be those who purposely try to land into bases or try to forceglitch into bases with a feature like this.Unfortunately for those reasons I just dont think it would work.,h1z1,crfvmy3,1,t5_31a08

Able to place them on the ground though. I was able to place a large shelter with a metal door and a metal wall on my deck they were placed post patch.

Stay as far away from the bears as you can also the bears do warn you that you are getting to close if you continue on your path they will attack. Now with that being said that does not mean there is not a bug with them porting to people I have not encounter it yet but my advise would be to watch and lissen for them stay away unless you have a weapon to kill them.  Last even starting with a good code when adding things other things have a chance of bring broken or changed in a way they did not expect.  This is an early access game if you find a bug report it that is the only way it is going to get fixed.  If you dont like reporting then dont play a EA game.

And I did want to imply that you should be able to drop a slab of venison to potentially entice a bear but that a rabbit nugget might not dissuade it from snacking on you.Honey is a bit more difficult to get your hands on if youre not established in a base but it should be the item with the highest chance of getting a bear to leave you alone long enough to allow you to get away.The downside to this is that I would imagine carrying meat in your backpack might actually attract bears and wolves so much like a neutral player character you might want to just drop all of your meat if a bear takes interest in you or stick to bottled food like Rabbit Stew which wont put off any scent for predators to key on.,h1z1,croivtm,1,t5_31a08

4179116,0,t1_crwlgvy,Difference between adding classes and a progressive skill system. Classes are restrictive by nature and a skill system allows choice. Good example is Ultima Online PreUOR vs WoW when it comes to skills. Preselecting permanent professions at the character creation screen menu or what not is beyond stupid. Progressing in a skill by using it is fine.Id be perfectly fine with skills that progressed on use. IE chopping a tree raises lumberjacking repairing cars raised mechanical making clothes raises tailoring yada yada yada... but if its not a dynamic based system that allows you to learn numerous skills than its a complete fail. Im even fine with preselecting these skills to give a slight edge in its value during character creation but those skills should be able to diminish if you decided against those professions. The way its starting to pan out so far is just lunacy. ,h1z1,crwmh4l,0,t5_31a08

4267922,0,t1_cs6o4zt,I understand the frustration the unfortunate thing is is that hackers are a part of the game at this time. Having a second person able to sit in the drivers seat means that they cant just get in and drive they would have to kill the player which gives an opportunity to report the death since you couldnt see the name. This is not ideal at all but if you dont go out with the expectation that there are cheaters out there and play with that in mind you are just going to get yourself frustrated. Hopefully soon many of the blatant cheats will be a thing of the past but right now it kinda sucks. There is a system for reporting cheaters but as you stated that you couldnt even see the player thats not going to help either. Another thing to note is this it may not even have been a hack. There is a bug out there where you have people in a car and the game crashes leaving the driver invisible to everyone. happened to me once and didnt even know it until some friends got on Im not excusing it but just providing a possible scenario.

OH and fiend friends and make enemies  Server remembers everything your character had on himher. Just log back in and youll see that youre at the same spot. And its serverbased  you cant login into Server X and log out with plenty of ammo and everyhing you need to live and then log out and back in into Server Y  there you will have a different character to prevent ghosting You will never know  Thatss the point where your adrenalin starts to flow once you see other players D Police Stations is always a good target for guns. But beware! Everybody knows this and you will most likely encounter other players there Just google for Hz recipes discover the stuff you wanna create build it afterwards and then place it in the world. Server will remember the buildings aswell so think twice before putting a foundation and other shit fown near crowded places  Other players will be able to destroy the stuff IF youre playing on a PvP server,h1z1,cs6wkc2,2,t5_31a08

4284681,0,t3_3a1rw1, Randomly freezes then crashes or simply dumps to desktop. Ive noticed this while looting or shifting items around but also while doing nothing more than running on a road during a corpse run OR standing inside a church not moving at all. Sometimes it crashes within  minutes of playing other times it seems to work fine for an hour or more though I was in a wooded lownonpop area. Coincidence? Assuming I did die during every crash my character was reloading back to the same spawn point it had started in when it respawned before the crash. I believe there is already a bug report for it but the client still freezes when hitting respawn especially if you respawned and then immedietly died and attempted to respawn again. Noticed several spots with phantominvis geometry. Open a door try to walk through it and its actually an invis wall. First time I had ever been killed by an invisible zombie. I could see him bite me unloaded  shotgun rounds the isolated area he could be in. Didnt do any damage. I either ended up being stuck in geometry punjis or this death yet another instance of the next item. Noticed that mouse look and movement appeared to be disabled after being grabbed by zombies. Died twice this way or x if above. It may be related to looting and having inventory opened when initially grabbed? Not sure. I was still missing mouse functionality on the deathrespawn screen.,h1z1,cs8lqq4,1,t5_31a08

Zombies in there could be dress as stereotypical homosexual and you could find item related to that in there.

4347512,0,t3_3arm7e,Not sure what was in the update this morning but the memory leak is really bad for me now. I made  arrows and killed a few zombies. Game wasnt too bad at that point. I went out and gathered more wood for arrows and of course more zombies. I went back to my base and crafted  more arrows to clear out what was spawning around my base. I had to log out of the game. After crafting the arrows the game became laggy. I went out to shoot at the zombies and the lag from the memory leak was so bad. I couldnt even use the bow the game was so unresponsive. Granted there were around  zombies in front of my base at the time. My game memory use went from . to . crafting the arrows and . to . in  seconds when I was standing by the zombies. ,h1z1,csfp3bh,1,t5_31a08

I recommend building near a town like PV or Cranberry but any housing development will do the trick. You want to constantly be getting metal and wood. These two basic items will make or break your experience. Base building and hoarding weapons will be what you spend the majority of your time on initially.

4384728,0,t1_csjutcy,agree here scionics you seem tro be only one with head out of your ass. The base pvp aspect will never change no matter how rare you make guns it will just be the days of bow fights instead of gun fights. Only thing to make the game less PvP is to add more stuff.... so you have more items to think about more items means each spawn is less likely to have the same bullets or fertilizer which in itself will lessen the amount of gunsammo in game...... and as it is go cut down a tree anywhere near PV to farm some wood youll have to probly defend your tree cutting or scrap metal farming so the post about resource farming taking time just makes the game closer to a WoW then an HZas it stands it seems really wierd to me that i am beating a wrecked car to get bits of scrap metal with a crow bar no less. Update worn letters to include all camo backpacks have them drop random loot maybe land mines and gunammo instead of arshotgun and the same  shots. for me just being able to get that beautiful tan camo backpack will increase my playtime in game raiding and trying to get others worn letters. Stay away from any mechanic which strengthens the geared players against ungeared players too much as your servers will die when you stop having wipes as new players will have a hard time finding a way. Perhaps limit amount of player owned base structures on the map and introduce new low HP type structures that make the map more dynamic for firefights so that your territory can truly become your own and every part of the map will look different in each server without it being the eyesore of  foot metal sheet bases. and fix they base mechanics so people cant build shelters on shleters to boost into peoples base really cheesey and does nothing to help server lag with a building mechanic so profitable for raiding but so bad for server resources,h1z1,csjw8oi,1,t5_31a08

The map has a massive amount of room available for building in it ... doing it on pavement or blocking gates in new spawn locations is just people being asshats. If bored take a tour of the PVE servers and see just how bad the trolling is.Taking control of a resource in PvP is one thing ... doing so in PvE is another. There are several servers that the basement to the Governors mansion is blocked off  minutes after a wipe and stays that way until the next wipe. Opfer wilderness camp ... completely boarded up on more than one server. Ranchito has half the homes boarded up on a server as well. This is NOT the way to build a playerbase or retain one. Griefing will happen as there are many people that should have been swallowed instead of being allowed to swim to the egg.

Instead of putting something out and then working to make sure all the game breaking bugs are fixed they put something out and then start working on the next set of features and players suffer for it. And I get the whole alpha argument you dont need to parrot that at me but it just reeks of unprofessionalism. The memory leak The Stamina bug ZombiesBearsWolves clipping through doors and walls If you crash with one of the above on you youre dead because your player just stands there unable to defend yourself.All of these are game breaking bugs that have been around for a long time.

I think it should be really risky for example it should leave u vulnerable to revive them say takes  secs with not having a weapon drawn.   Its just something to think about in team BR because it would suck for it to die out because teams are losing a guy early and people would rather just leave and restart a new game instead of sit around for  mins having to wait on their team to finish.,h1z1,csufonz,0,t5_31a08

4632653,0,t1_ctef5ir,Except thats not true.  The HZ hacks work in PS as well and there was an uptick in PS hacking when HZ became popular.  The reason hackers arent as prevalent in PS is because the damage they can do is not very high.  You dont lose anything when you die in that game and one hacker alone isnt necessarily going to ruin anything long term.  You also have to play a long time in PS to unlock a lot of stuff for your character so at a certain point hacking just doesnt have much appeal within the structure of the PS design.HZ doesnt have unlocks or necessarily perks for length of chatacter play.  Its all about time investment on what you have equipped and stored at a base.  And all of that can be easily lost and set you back to square one.  Hackers are significantly more destructive in HZs environment and THEY KNOW IT which is why theyll keep coming back.  Hacking doesnt go away unless you lock stuff down by not trusting the players client but thats increased server overhead that DBG doesnt want to do.The only way youll ever get a mostly cheater free environment is on a white listed server managed by a reputable community and it remains to be seen if well ever get that.,h1z1,cteik5z,2,t5_31a08

4667769,0,t1_ctirrph,I personally think it is extremely awesome of DBG to have features like this in place that are helpful for the colorblind but I have to agree with some of the other posters. I think that this should not be the default or at least toggleable. I can not tell you how many times I have gone to place something like a foundation constantly checking and rechecking the position. It used to irk me a lot when I would misplace something due to that constant wobble effect. Granted we can now pick stuff up and place it back down until we get it right however while it is a minor gripe I believe that most players would find satisfaction in being able to place things the right time the first time.On the other point when I play its typically in third person. Personally I find it super aggravating to have to constantly switch back to third person while I am building anything.Now as for a suggested alternative to the bouncing effect I think I may have a better way to distinguish between the two modes those being object is placeablenonplaceable. As I understand it the issue stems from not being able to distinguish between red and green. So instead of a motion that becomes intense on large objects like that what if instead you did something like this.ImgurBasically instead of the scaling sin wave place diagonal stripes on the object instead. You could even have those stripes slowly rotate around the object.If this isnt a viable option then another possibility would be to have the intensity of the bounce scale depending on the size of the in game object.Just some ideas to bounce off you all.

4689811,0,t1_ctljc4b,I guess I should clarify that I dont expect to get things for free Id rather just buy a game with an upfront price than any subsequent monthly or per use fees.  MMOs have had sub fees for sure but HZ isnt really the same kind of game as WoW. In the case of HZ I dont see BR as being different than say a Ground War mode from CoD namely its a different game type but not deserving of a stand out fee.I can understand why theyve elected to make it a feebased game given its ultimate launch as freetoplay. Personally I dont support the model and tend to avoid any games that come with necessary fees I.e. Fees required to playexperience the whole game.Im guessing the per month approach was felt to be a better revenue stream  cest la vie. Ill play it for free during EA and abandon the game once its play model changes.Id prefer to see upfront pricing standard for all games with the only pays being for skins and such items that have no bearing on the mechanics or success of the player. Thats said given weapon purchases in TF CS and the direction that HZs taking its obvious that industry has been and will continue moving in that direction. I just have a hard time seeing it as anything other than nickle and diming. Bear in mind this is just opinion. I have no insight on whether this type of pricing model ultimately means more moneysupport for better games deeper pockets for devs etc... I just have a preferred payment model that Ive grown used to over many years of gaming.,h1z1,ctlozkc,1,t5_31a08

But if you didnt want to do this and couldnt handle the instability then maybe you shouldve researched a little more and not purchased the EARLY ACCESS ALPHA that was for purchase on Steam.

4717947,0,t3_3fefd0,Baseshack decay rates should increase once a door of said baseshack is gone. Also the player log in time to keep ownership of a base should also decay faster than it does now. Claiming a base is cool and all but it does nothing to reduce the amount of land plots. People tend to claim a base loot what they want and then leave it to decay. There are full size bases that I claimed which were built in the first week of the last sever wipes that are still standing because I cant even fully demo them to the ground which I would if I could but upper wallsdecks with extensionsetc. cant be demolished or bug out and are stuck hence the upper wall reference. I think all doors should decay in one week at the most once a door falls off and no door is replaced the entire structure baseshack should decay fully including all contents in no more than a week. If that was the case on the server I play on nearly half the build areas would be clear of clutter in Cranberry where I spend most of my time. Just around the PD alone over half of the bases have no activity no doors but the main structure still stands there serving no purpose. One guy built a bridge of tampers from the cabins south of Cranberry close to the PD and it just sits there not being used and doing nothing but since it is nothing but tampers and walls it wont decay. ,h1z1,ctp8hqq,1,t5_31a08

Well lets see on their bug tracker is over  issues.....lets give examples of a few....HZ is a zombie survival game except explosive arrows flaming arrows nor vehicles can kill zombies. Sometimes not even  shotgun blast can kill them however youll be attacked by invisible zombies all the time. Im sorry HaniiBlu but as a survival game you should be able to at least see the zombies and also kill them. These are fundamental issues with the core mechanics of the game which are not working and should work otherwise why continue to add content when the basic fundamentalkilling zombies doesnt work .The vehicle mechanics....lets not even go there the vehicle mechanics in this game are some of the worst ever.The weather mechanics while nice the game has  types of weather system foggy or foggy with rain.The zombies. They either massively aggressive or mentally challenged. The zombies also have spawn issues when you kill    more shouldnt spawn. There also shouldnt be more zombies on low population servers than high population servers.And last the prize mode BR.Players stack medkits to gain a gamebreaking unfair advantage to others at  health using a medkit should not gain you anything however it does youre able to soak bullets which is a unfair advantage to those who dont exploit this issue.No shoes causes a silent advantage but has no health loss issue why is this? Having no shoes should cause health drain not be a advantage.Guns spawn with no ammo I mean really why do you have to wait for ammo to spawn? Meanwhile a Chinese guy with a ms ping is fully geared.

While I appreciate your very direct communication with us and the straight up honesty of this post I still feel that the map is too small in regards to size after investing  hours or so into the game. I guess the expansive MMO feeling just isnt there without some expansiveness to the game world. Im having issues putting into words but as it stands I feel like Im thrown into a sparsely dotted death pit whenever I spawn. I know some of these issues can be adressed by fleshing out the current map more  but I feel like the game needs a map expansion before its really ready for release.

I still gladly gave up my  and have done what I could to help progress this game through suggestions criticisms and bug reports.

But even disregarding that its just not great writing. Theres also the professional fact that if he was a journalist he would without a doubt direct the readers to his other work instead of working with a pseudonym. This seems like a rather cheap attempt to create more authority and weight more than anything else. Theres no need to explain your background if you arent willing to prove what you claim and then resort to to avoid awkward moments.

Here you go  you have an indestructible gate  an upper shelter that you cant get in and most of the time you also cant reach since it is flying in the air. We raid bases almost every  days we have seen this every day  we even used an insane amount of EIDs ethanol and bio fuel until THE DECK FOUNDATION WAS COMPLETLY EMPTY from anything except from the back gate with the flying shelter.BIG YES TO THE NEW SECURITY MEASURES..

4896055,0,t3_3hxjy5,The bar has fallen so low that its hard to be excited about anything anymore. No body sim no weather that affects gameplay more than making it hard to see no map expansion no building overhaul the system was supposedly going to be a complete revamp as of  months ago not improved no meaningful expansion of any of the stuff we already have like farming no real improvement in zombie AI etc. etc. And most damning of all no real indication of forward momentum in the fight against hackers on high pop servers. I envy the people who are still optimistic enough to believe any of things mentioned above will be delivered in worthwhile fashion a year from now let alone within the next few months. A handful of screenshots of the PoI thats been in dev for weeks  some new clothing and heads doesnt really stoke my hype meter nor convince me that game will be making a turnaround. Since January the only major additions I can think of to Survival are bee boxes and beds. We also got grenades and explosive arrows but that was almost certainly facilitated by Battle Royale. Unless something extremely drastic changes before DGC starts charging event tickets for BR I cant really see HZ surviving that particular transition without losing the vast majority of its current population. Trying to promote the game with Battle Royale is sealing its fate that much quicker. ,h1z1,cuboqdc,8,t5_31a08

4966181,0,t1_cujyhiz,Decay is a bit of a chore the way its implemented at the moment hopefully the construction box will allow us to maintainrepair the base in a more fluid way. Right now its a bit buggy and a pain trying to figure out how to reach certain spots like outer walls. Hammers also dont repair unless you find the sweet spots and its a big pain having a decay bar appear every few hours thats not realistic at all but Im personally of the opinion of favoring fluid amp intuitive mechanics over realism. Im shocked to hear it said that anyone was asking for this to come back. I was very thankful during the past few patches when the only things decaying were gatesdoors. This is a step backwards not forward in making HZ enjoyable its just a time sink. Im guessing maybe the decay is supposed to act as a way of regulating the server from filling up with abandoned bases if thats the case Id suggest maybe just allowing us to have option to examine deckfoundation display a window that shows a percentage of everything on the base and just repair it that way and subtract the necessary metal wood andor hammer durability. But then again Im really hoping this is just a poor place holder for the planned construction box.....on the topic of realism why cant we fill a bottle in the rain? Why cant we rest before we leave our base? Why cant we eatreload in a moving vehicle? Why is the same amount of metal sheets required for plated armor as an entire shelter? I dont know I dont get the appeal of realism people often bring up it usually comes off like a bit of a cop out. Its endless and doesnt really get anywhere.,h1z1,cukixi7,1,t5_31a08

Right now its pretty much HIGH means over  players MED is between  and  and LOW is  and below.Weve been talking about displaying more information like better population information and ping and lag information as well in the server select and we probably will do that along with making the overall server selection more intuitive and easy for players to group up.Medium Players have it the worst imo Something like this would be better Low Green  Low Yellow  Medium Green  Medium Yellow  Medium Red  High Green  High Yellow  High Red You could add a mouseover tooltip that shows the current bracket to make it more obvious.Im sure someone could make these changes in less than a day.,h1z1,cuu5n9l,10,t5_31a08

5056144,0,t3_3k70w5,Depends on what you mean by What if hz didnt have BR. If youre mean what if they removed BR now like it feels like you actually mean HZ would probably not be too popular because of said reasons. However the way you ask the question you ask if what if they never added BR. In that case you can take all the time the devs have worked on making Br the way it is now and add that to survival. The game would probably still be very popular and have a lot more contentless bugs. maybe even less hackers because having BR is like having a completely different game to take care of. If theyd focus on survival and only survival it would be less bug fixings etc because the other gamemode needs fixing. ,h1z1,cuvgfve,3,t5_31a08

Please try to read what I wrote not what you want me to have written it will help communication better.I said that most of the code was already done and mature.  It had to be changed to fit the engine and fit in with the APIs.  But there is a lot of code specific to the game mode that can be copied along the mode did not have to be developed from scratch.gt For BR to be the main part of this game is just showing Playerunknown hell get rich when he does a standalone version which will happen eventually.BR is not the main part of this game as has been detailed by numbers time and again and yes when PlayerUknown releases his stand along version something he admits will take years because he has to write the engine it will run on from the ground up... he will be rich and I welcome that happening to him hes a great guy and deserves it.gt DayZ mod BTW is light years beyond HZ and stand alone isnt all that bad and has a crack team hard at work.And all of that development was done long before HZ...

So the cheating issue gets ignored then most of the promised features that the game was sold on get canceled then the nickel and dimeing begins the only new content is skins that do nothing no new real game content is added they get as much cash as they can then shut the game down.. ,h1z1,cuxsd72,2,t5_31a08

5090575,0,t1_cuzjsga,I realize that hackingcheating is something they cannot simply fix however the lack of an anticheat systemdetection and the fact that this has plagued this game from the onset is problematic.  Were  months into an open alpha and the hackingcheating is just as bad as it was in the beginning.In response to your other points. While I somewhat agree having hosted servers Im not sure how DBG would feel about letting the community be the flood gates to their player base.. I never said just fix all the bugs right now.  Yes this is alpha yes there are bugs but there are certain bugs which have been a recurring problem.  Right now I dont see any as game breaking only the hacking cheating is game breaking for me at this point.  To give you an example  a most obvious bug that is annoying to a lot of folks is the persistent rain sound.  Sure you can log out of the game and log back in but come on really?.  What I mean by do away with the test server is  put a test server in rotation.  Eliminate the single source for them to test things on.  Weve all seen how horribly the patch roll outs have been in the past.  Why not select Antidote one week or two test your patches there where the server load is much more normal then if all goes well roll out to the rest of the servers.  Then the next couple weeks choose Alastor or Bane or whichever server you want.  The point of which is to have your patches tested in a more realistic setting than the test server.  Shit its alpha right?  Shouldnt all the servers in theory be test servers?.  You may be right that theres no money in it  time will tell.  But I can tell you that for many folks survival is what brought them to the game in the first place.  How do people learn the map to quickly navigate in BR? Survival of course.  I played very little BR early on but as time has dragged on there is less to do in survival and you get bored with it.  Im sure Im not the only one who feels that way.  BR standalone might survive but I for one would never pay to play it.  What I would pay to play if it were stable and they had an anticheat that worked? Survival..  I agree with you on this one many of the discussions on this sub have become toxic.  However theyre the ones who chose this as their platform for communication.  I see many good threads constructive ones that have no input from the Devs while once in a blue moon I will see a comment to one from one of them.  That goes a long way when they do decide to break their silence.I hope we can continue this discourse as I feel it is constructive.,h1z1,cuzlug4,2,t5_31a08

TMC website updated the cheats client for the game so now things such as mega bases can be placed. the old system of door closed so no clippers cant kill you or loot you storage containers is now gone. they simply waited till close enough to twitch.con to show just how broken this game is due to its lack of anti cheat system. Its not even that hard a problem to resolve the problem is the fact that the game is client side and not server side. swap it around and you will see a large difference also doesnt help that this game uses the same engine as planetside and guess what ruined that game? you got it the cheaters,h1z1,cv0ynzg,2,t5_31a08

He is changing it to increase FPS.  Which could also be considered an advantage I suppose but that is the point of changeable settings so that the player can get the game working best for them on their machines.And the settings is not being changed below an intended value the problem is that the game is not properly applying the setting.  If someone were changing the setting to a nonrealistic number to cause the game to break like  to initiate a buffer overflow error for example I could see that as being an issue that would seem an exploit to me.

5212376,0,t1_cve63a9,I really like the idea of making a game with the Players input as to what they really want as opposed to the focus test approach that was popular a while back. The problem with transparency is transparency. When things dont go as planned everyone sees and you are forced to deal with frustrated players in a way that you didnt have to before. a lot of players. The benefits of EA are the amount of folks you have hammer on yer game at one time. Its much better to have  people testing yer game than ten. You really find the bad and the ugly much faster that way. Thats what happened with Hz. once you get everybody in and building things and running around you find out quickly where the memory is jacked and the where the problems lie. So then theres the not so good part. During the EA process Players are playing a broken game most of the time. We are used to it as devs but players who pay money expect more for their cash than busted gameplay and delayed content. Thats a fair sentiment.Had we not charged folks they would not feel as entitled as they do.but we did  and they do.... Charging people for EA made it possible for us to have the resources to make a better game. Meaning a bigger budget and a little more time to do it better which we are doing. ,h1z1,cvea8un,3,t5_31a08

Not buying the b.s. excuses your keeping the map small to better suit BR.. Im not saying the map needs to be ridiculous like the whole united states Thats silly.

5497349,0,t3_3qdx27,I don like KOSers either but this isnt the answer.  I would say if you kill someone that isnt on your property your name should turn red and be seen at a far distance.  And for every kill after that they should get a counter of kills.  Some will look at this as a badge.  But anyone who sees a red name will know not to negotiate but KOS them.  The non KOSers can go around in hunting parties to take these people out.  Also if you take out a red name you will not go red yourself.  This counter should stay with you even if your die and last the until the next server wipe.  If you watch the Walking Dead the KOSers are the Wolves.  Dont you think that humanity as a whole should gang up to defeat them?  So I say let there be a war between the uncivil and the do gooders.  Maybe you can get a special item by taking out red names.  Just thought this up and Im sure there is a better way but this is a start.,h1z1,cwec6xr,2,t5_31a08

The only thing Survival will get from all this hate is more rushed patches with even more broken things that more people will complain about. Im actually happy to see Survival updates coming out because I know how much Survival is an important part of HZ but when Battle Royale gets something all I see in this subReddit is so much hate towards Battle Royale the Battle Royale players and Daybreak. The most ridiculous thing is that except from the gamemode and the Showdown case the update that came out in the Test Server is really survivalfocused. You cannot know yet if it breaks things or not since its still on the Test Server but Ive heard really good feedback from people who tried it on the Test Server and Im really excited and waiting for it to come out next Tuesday even if I dont play Survival.

Im totally convinced this bitch fest wouldnt be more than a whisper. And Im not talking about bugs and glitches but CORE ISSUES.... meat not bones!What good will a new map new base addition or new gun do if the CORE ISSUES are still present? what difference does lagging in an old map or new one? or be hacked in a old base or a new concept one?.. the list is long and very very old so I wont waist time copypasting them just check the posts.what would you do against hackers? what about cheaters too? solutions are posted all over the website but not a real approach from the devs. Just the old same song wait it will be done later than sooner but it will!!Want a cheap one? pay   hr to a MODERATOR in server so he can go from server to server killing hackerscheaters banning them and taking care of them IN THE SPOT while you pay him MINIMUM WAGE. OF COURSE give some extras like free coffee and free sandwich from the coffee  truck!!  OLD STYLE DUDE!!Damn I will even charge them  Hr   Burger king meals a day for doing IT!! GOD im that cheap!!

Because they cant pull their head out of their ass for five minutes and have a civil discussion. There is like a group of like twenty to thirty people who just live on this subreddit and circle jerk each other all day just because they are frustrated about the game. They rush to any positive post and spam it with down votes while up voting all of their arguments that either dont make sense or are bashing DBG. The DEVs do read all of the posts that they can and they DO WANT to make a good game for everybody to enjoy however whenever I log on to read whats new up voted or newer posts it just makes me sick to my stomach.

5635601,0,t1_cwvjcfe, of your comments are negative toward HZ and you do not generally pose constructive comments.I never said you were not entitled to give your opinion just that it is worthless based on how you represent them.gtYOU are the reason why Early Access is able to rip off gamers. Well first I paid  buck for a game I have  hours in and play every few days so I most certainly did not get ripped off.But not sure how you got to that?  I am neither defending nor deriding the game.  Thats on you. That I choose not to equate this game with more importance than it deserves does not make me culpable to the state of the game.  In fact you are in my opinion contributing to the downfall. You start arguments make negative posts for the bandwagon to jump on call the game shit call out devs and basically bitch so much about it that it all becomes background noise.  In addition you do it in a way that screams self importance and you use we a lot as if everyone must have your point of view.Then one morning you see a patch and right after you complain in a different posting you tell people to give it a chance.  How can your opinion which you are certainly entitled to be relevant?,h1z1,cwvneu8,3,t5_31a08

5713479,0,t3_3tcegt,Heres an idea for the future.  One of the original concepts for the game was to be able to take over existing structures.  If the base building system is never going to be a free form block system Id much rather see a way to semi permanently occupy structures.The system could be designed so that instead of building you fortify existing structures.  For example a fence could be built up into a high fence  Maybe the next tier would be to reinforce it with sheet metal and so on.  For windows they could be boarded up upgraded with bars etc.  Doors could follow a similar pattern  wood reinforced with sheet metal plate etc.  For realism every successive tier would be built onto the previous and this could be reflected in the artwork.I think this would fit in a lot better with the zombie survival theme you guys are shooting for.,h1z1,cx5b9xn,1,t5_31a08

If Summit suddenly says HZ is complete shit no one should play it anymore that is several thousand people that will probably slow their play or stop entirely. Its as simple as business sense.Its really just like trying to please game review sites but in modern times. How many WALMART ONLY EDITION of games exist and all of that shit. Streamers  YouTubers offer more exposure. This has always happened since basically the inception of the medium. In fact almost every company does this to some extent but DGC takes it a little far.They would much rather have a large streamer praise a portion of the game than the minority of players that is this subreddit.

As long as your KD is high and you win more than you lose... As long as you show youre not invincible its believable. I win all the damned time I dont cheat. There are better people out there who play this game for a living or way more than me theyre better than me. Example If OPsct and I are in a fair AR long range battle. Im okay that hes supposed to win. If I knew this Id take a more tactical approach to killing him. He doesnt cheat. That argument means nothing. There are cheaters out there who rely too much on their cheats and are shitters... In the past there have been very patient and opportunistic cheaters in all games even in esports. People have cheated forever wo being caught. Perhaps youre one of the better cheaters. Sadly however they followed you on your off night or detected some software. Sorry babe.

If I remember correctly.Then it is a bit... off.They dont need to give us a response in the ticketsystem only officially tagging it as a Known Bug and maybe Under Investigation when someone is working on it instead of letting the reporter think it is being ignored.All in all we dont need full disclosure but we need them to keep at least one Launch Promise which was to let us build HZ together with the developers.. not a random voting poll every  months which will be put in a corner until they find time to solve some issue they clearly arent prioritizing.Either have a weekly voting poll or let the community submit their work into a voting system. If alot of people vote on a community submission the developers can take a look at it and decide if the quality is good enough and if not.. make the changes themselves or give feedback.Something like this  would give the game a real community and some people would start brainstorming for new additions to the game. And the developers would have something much more interesting for weekly livestreams.. talking about the work that the developers AND the community is doing to improve upon the game.Which could be Most voted community submissions or Most discussed ideas or why a highly voted submission wont be included into the game and the reasons.

This is identical as they just extend the range of what is being checked. Then you have people saying  Make a trading UI for players.

Chest is armor pants cover the legs shoes cover feet and Helmets head motor cycle helmet face.

6133609,0,t1_cymt7ei,Not at all I am all for playing  against . I for one am perfectly fine with  against . What I am against is when a guy joins up expecting four partners and gets killed or abandoned by their team and that is considered okay by dev standards. Yet teaming in a regular situation is bannable.Dont get me wrong I completely understand that people would want a fair solo vs solo experience and that is  understandable and acceptable. But on the same token some of us like to log into a regular br where we could run into any number of people and never know who is teaming or not or maybe work a guy into teaming with us for a few gas cycles and see who betrays who first. I think arbitrary rules that have no system behind it is bullshit. Devs should not be banning teamers in game when they cant code a system to prevent it or just split the servers into three types Team vs Team Solo vs Solo and Anything goes. I have no problem with disadvantages. I think that makes you a better player and people should be smarter in a game like this. To many go all Terminator on everyone just going straight into buildings running around without caution and playing like its COD when it should be a strategy survival thing. Then when they die its a blaming thing. Either its a hacker a teamer or something.

From all i have seen it does not attack. if i am wrong about that forgive me.you can have more than one variant of zombie.....it just needs to not have special powers. This zombie is like its out of STALKER like it has some kind of psychic power. All they have to do is make the fucking zombies like they were on the pre alpha video.  They should be rushing at you like madmen....make them dangerous. Honestly its been a year  what is the fucking excuse still that they cant put them back the way the originally were???  tech and servers arnt good enough? cmon you know the majority of excuses they have given are complete bullshit. They just failed to do it properly the first time probably cut lots of corners and it came back to bite them.honestly this zombie is pointless when the regular zombies are so retarded. plus with them not doing anything about the way zombies spawn....all its going to do is scream and your probably going to see zombies appear out of thin air around you. you know damn well they will implement it like shit just like the majority of all the rest of what they have done to this point.its honestly not a hard fix they are just unwilling to do what is needed.  profit over product qualityand before you say dont like it uninstall already way ahead of you hahaha.anyways not trying to attack you im just tired of so many people still blinded by all the bullshit.

6300291,0,t1_cz5nc7g,gt Yes DGC made everyone mad and failed to deliver a lot of what we wanted but at some point we have to stop the constant whining.They have no one to blame but themselves. If you dont want your community angry then dont make your community angry. If they keep doing the same mistakes like today then people will keep getting angrier. gt They were much more active in conversations here back before they made everyone so mad. Since then the pitchforking never ever stops.Look... Im all up with not doing a witch hunt but literally a couple of days ago a dev in this very sub promised DBG was going to make an effort to do a better job with communication. And a couple of days later this happens. Im sorry but I got disappointing and frustrated... Im calling them out on their errors in the hope they man up and fix them. The developers arent children. They dont get to be afraid and the notion that only the bravest have the guts to post comments here is sad... They made mistakes I get it! Lets move on... But I will only move on after they get their shit together and start fixing their screw ups. gt Seriously which would I rather have them wasting time to tell me about a MB update or them using that time to prepare or communicate more important things? Or to work on hiring more community outreach?I REALLY DONT CARE about this MB update. I care about their disregard of the community to the point they couldnt even bother taking  seconds to tell people something like Servers are going to be down for a moment so we can fix some stuff on the server. This shouldnt impact the client software. Seriously... If it takes so long for a Community Manager to write that on a reddit post maybe he shouldnt be managing the community. Either way LegionCM already said this apparently wasnt his fault. Its someone else who couldnt be bothered to stand up on his desk and shout Yo! Legion! Warn the players the server will be down for a sec!. Thats literally all the work itd take a developer. Try that... Stand up on your desk and shout  Yo! Legion! Warn the players the server will be down for a sec!... What wonderful work could you have done during that time? Seriously... I dont care about the downtime. I dont care about the update. I am not wasting my time with that. I am choosing a larger battle. My battle is against the lack of communication on an ALPHA game.. Theres a lot of people down in the comments trying to hijack my post to make it look like Im whining about an update. I really dont care.. The only information I wanted about this update was This update doesnt affect the client software in any relevant way. TLDR I just want to see they take their community seriously... I want to see that because then Ill know if I wasted my money on this game or not. Since this game is going FP I could simply waited for the release. If I chose to gave them my hard earned money its because I expect to influence development. Like the alpha badge implies and like they explicity told me on their promotional material. So far their communication has been so awful that yeah... Even the small downtimes annoy me. If they want me to stop bitching about communication then I want them to first remove the alpha from what theyre always calling an alpha game. Because so far... This isnt an alpha. This is just milking a cow to death. I hope this clears your confusion about what I meant... EDIT And if you want to make this battle even larger just imagine what other companies will do when they figure that users just let this stuff slide. Pretty soon almost every game would be an Alpha. Developers wouldnt be held accountable for anything since its an alpha while racking up as much money as they could... ,h1z1,cz5rsn9,0,t5_31a08

6331176,0,t1_cz99nhh,Zombie count back then didnt rely as heavily in there being players around it was random zombies spread around the map with a slightly higher chance to spawn in bigger areas like the main cities. They changed that after a while to spawn more of them based on location I.E. the dam hospital etc and also to be dependant on how many players in in a certain radius of each other.Each zombie fills a slot on the server counting for Wildlife. There are  main areas on the map the Dam Hospital PV and Cranberry. Those places are priority spawns. Most zombies will spawn there taking up a lot of the slots. The more spread out players become the more spread out those other slots become. Say you have one player down at the very bottom left and two or three on the bottom right. The majority of those remaining slots for the zombies will be taken by spawns near those two or three people. And a few for the one guy by himself. This is a flaw in daybreaks system but nobody else has come up with a good way to solve this issue without killing the server. In my honest opinion I do not think that we have affordable server hardware capable of handling big scale zombie packs roaming everywhere with networking if we do then we also have to consider engine limitations and engine networking limits. If you look at ARK for instance they have pushed the limits of unreal engines networking capability with their island which doesnt seem big at all since youve gotten to playing the game. In a few years maybe someone will develop an engine capable of handling both the networking aspect and NPC counts while not overburdening a server but that most likely wont happen anytime soon. ,h1z1,cz9a9yg,1,t5_31a08

Maps do spawn at the tables and scrap metal and sheets do spawn in the cars there along with weapon repair kits.Fireaxe worked mostly but sometimes while skinning animals it would not skin it.Not sure why they ever fixed this in the first place. You should have to carry a combat knife or machete to skin or harvest from animals. Ever tried to skin an animal with an axe? Doesnt work so well. The Q  shove  command still does not work. Please address the issue!It is working for me. I have never noticed it not working. Can now use bar b que on someones foundation. storage are still inaccessible as are repair boxes.You need the owner to set permissions to allow you to open a container in PvE. In PvP blowing the gate should give you access to the containers. Canned food is abundant. Additionally MREs are in every trash can. MREs do not give comfort. This should be addressed.I believe this is intentional. MREs are not supposed to give any comfort.Bushes and twigs still have issues while autorunning. I can pick up some but not all. You can pick up everything while running using WASD.You are usually traveling at a faster rate while auto running. You can slow down a bit and still auto run by punching into the air while auto running. This essentially changes your stance but still allows you to auto run. There is about  ms delay after picking up a stick branch or berry. If the plants are too close together you wont be able to get them all at a full run.

6423357,0,t3_43o1hn,First attempt at survivalSo I click on the first server in the list that is in the EU ABONDONEDthis is worst thing when u are . beginner . lone wolf player . survival prefering player. Abandoned is server for where i recomend to play in  group players with all of futuristic high end PCs. Something like hello im friendly you can clearly forget i can tell you.About doors u put in password only once after that is closed for everyone except you or players who enter a code previously.For best survival experience i recomend low pop. Low pop servers are also less of KOS or fake bandits. If you want same survival without killing just go PvE. Bastile EU is best PvE server i played. Anyways big updates are incoming devs said and its only alpha version keep in mind. Nice post anyways,h1z1,czjpmrm,1,t5_31a08

6466828,0,t1_cznfvu8,That comment wasnt necessarily aimed directly at you this has been posted about before.  Part of the skill and what makes the game tense is that you need your team mates and you dont want to hit them and kill them when the heat is on...It takes much more skill and adds bucket loads more tension and atmosphere to try and avoid them in a fire fight...It can also be quite hilarious when despite your best intentions you kill an ally.  Are you saying you really just want to be able to mindlessly spray at your team mates without effect or consequence and thats an improvement to the game?  Its really not and would ruin team BR.  You want the wrong solution to the problem...youre basically going to ruin the game for a lot of people to improve it for far fewer.  If tking was such a massive issue it would be reported daily on reddit and your post would have hundreds of replies but it doesnt because its a problem for the minority rather than the majority.  Yes something needs to be done but adding in invulnerability to friendly fire is definitely not it.  The game needs a report tk or karma system.,h1z1,czo7rqp,1,t5_31a08

6475957,1,t3_44bzl6,As someone who purchased HZ but is only interested in Battle Royale and not in Survival I want to thank you so much for this decision. I think that this decision will benefit both Survival and Battle Royale players. Im really excited for HZ King of the Kill and really looking forward to what its development team has in store for us especially when itll come out of Early Access and in the PS and Xbox One which I personally think is a great decision that will really benefit King of the Kill by opening it to a wider audience and therefore getting more players and money that will be used to make this game even better. Ive been waiting for a split between Battle Royale and Survival for a long time and have suggested it many times before and Im really happy that you decided to listen to the community and go for it although it might not be as easy as the current situation is.  I do hope that Survival players will benefit from this as well and maybe in the future Ill even enjoy playing HZ Just Survive Ill own them both anyway.Thank you Daybreak this is a great decision and Im really looking forward to see what the future of HZ has in store for us ,h1z1,czp5sjk,0,t5_31a08

And what do you do to a tumoryou cut it offcmon now.... it means good things for BR... it means bad things for survival..... Look at how overwhelmingly the population is split.... BR claims about what is it now..  or more of the games population ... and since we have both versions for free ... do you think those players will stop what they are already doing and play Just Survive? ... no because if they wanted to.. they would be playing that version alreadyand do you think that Just Survive is going to actually sell? .... Think about it....The people who would want Just Survive ... ALREADY BOUGHT HZ because what Just Survive is going to be.... is what hz was advertised as before it went into EA .. so the people who want to play just surive.. are already here... they wont pay the  bucksNow lets go back to population amountsAre people going to want to go to the verison with less players? or are people going to go to the version they see on streams and their friends are playing chacnes are King of the hill version will be what they are playing because..  or more population is there... so chances are thats where more people will gravitate if they are buying Which concludes with Just Survive not selling as its own standalone verison BECAUSE survival players... already bought Just survive when they got hz... because again.. just survive.. is what hz was originally intended to be so if just survive isnt selling.... while KOTH version is selling well........ as a company what do you do.... you get rid of the problem I REALLY REALLY hope im wrong.... but when it comes to game design and predicting ... well... i can count on one hand the times ive been completely off ... i hope this adds a finger to the count ... its one of the rare times id love to be wrong anyway dude.. see you in game!! ...

People dont believe that this will be good for survival players. they think that DBG can now freely work on BRs and drag their ass with survival game updates... they can functionally abandon all plans for a survival game and just drag us along for months with tiny ass updates that dont improve quality of life.the only way DBG can prove survival players wrong is by posting a blog of planned updates and give us a sick one on that day of the game split. i really hope thats what they do.,h1z1,czrxku1,4,t5_31a08

6522796,0,t1_cztzi1n,Am the EP of both.  Joining Daybreak was an interesting process.  They reached out to me about the opportunity and in discussing it I found a really great alignment in the game and the industry both current day and the future of each.  This is something that is really important to me as a decision maker.  If that alignment is not there your stress increases and then you drink a bunch of whiskey.  I played HZ had some fun it but really felt like it had a ton of untapped potential.  Not only do I feel like I can tap that potential but just as important I felt Daybreak would support that process.I never really call out individual achievements on any game that I have been part of.  Creating a game is a humongous team effort so to take credit for something specific in it just goes against my values.  The only thing I would add is that when I first became a Producer my boss at the time Gjon Camaj told me that I would probably single handily have the biggest impact on the game but no one would realize it.  That really hit home with me I still vividly remember that conversation some  years later.,h1z1,czu0bqx,16,t5_31a08

6610199,0,t3_467ale,There have been a couple of tournaments hosted already Invitational Showdown and the weekly TAtournaments or whatever they are called. These tournaments have been successful and I really enjoy watching them. Also credit to the players for setting up these weekly tournaments.However I think it is also a problem that only selected NA streamers have the power to give out keys to people and that the keygiveaway  the tournaments always happen in NA time which is in the middle of the night for EU players. Hence it is hard for EU players to achieve these keys and participate in tourneys as they probably have other things to do in the night read sleep. I think Daybreak to start off with should make weeklymonthly tournaments for both EU and NA different tourney for each region that is that all players can join in on. These could be set up like for instance  People register within a certain daydate their participation along with their steamid. This would allow daybreak to allow that specific steamid to join a specific server. Depending on how many people register this many servers are set up.E.g  players register. servers with  players on each. Top  players advance to the next match which leaves us with server with  people. The winner wins. By doing this weekly leaderboards can be set up on the daybreak webpage and the scoring could be the same as in the showdown  place   point th place  points st place   points. I personally think this scoring is pretty bad but very simple. Scoring could also be  points for placing   points for  place  points for   points for   point for   points for  and one point more per position from there on. For example. As the time progress a leagueladder system can be made where you can distinguish the good from the bad. The rewards etc I dont want to get into. ,h1z1,d031tn1,2,t5_31a08

6634547,0,t1_d04axot,I know what your saying but honestly I would say if they released Just Survive for console too that would scream more  cash grab  to me than only doing BR.  Just Survive is nowhere near ready for release.  BR though is damn close  except new game modes   If they were to release Survival to PSXBOX one in its current state or a little better I think it would be a huge negative press against DBC vs waiting until the game is way further along.Edit  Plus wouldnt releasing both titles separately for console at the same time be a bigger cash grab?  Just my two cents they could have said both were coming this summer but only KOTK for now makes me think they know survival isnt ready for paid release on consoleHard to say honestly but either way all we can do is wait and see what happens ,h1z1,d05ki9p,2,t5_31a08

They are all a little different but I really like the genre and what makes it cool is actually having to survive. PvP is fine that can be part of survival. But when it becomes just a glorified arena for player fights then it does lose some of what makes the genre interesting to me.One of the reasons Battle Royale became so popular in my opinion is that it is the logical end point for what survival mode is anyway you just get to do it in a one off sortofcompetitive setting. The thought process goes Well if survival is really all about finding weapons and killing other players anyway i might as well just get right to it in BR.,h1z1,d05wgbm,1,t5_31a08

Find file UserOptions.ini and open it with text editor. Find line General and create empty line after it. Paste this ZoomToggle without quotes. Save the file and enjoy. To change it back to hold remove this line or change ZoomToggle to  ZoomToggle. Basically he clicks to aim instead of holding right mouse button...and then tap fires no cheating what so ever...even set up his config on stream and at hz showdown.,h1z1,d09yjb8,5,t5_31a08

I for one dont want to hear a bunch of later we are working on we would like to but.. or any of that crap. I want solid evidence that they are working on things. I want to see progress. I dont give a shit how the devs feel at this point. Not showing major improvements after months of promises will piss the player base off more than any thing they could say. They need to produce now. The time for talk is well past. Its time to get it done.Your response is evidence that you know they will be giving a bunch of passive comments on how things will be in the future but we will see NO improvements. No base building upgrades no rain or snow progress no new crafting no new body sims no birds fixed no armor to cars no new animals or plants no fishing no fix to the rendering system no news on forgelight . It will be  smoke up the ass again.As far as DayZ goes you are wrong. They do set time lines. They have goals set for each quarter and have nearly completed those goals. They post progress regularly on the advancement and give detailed patch notes and explanations when goals are not met. Just head over to DayZtv.com and see for yourself. They are nearly to beta already.As far as you saying if they say they are working on it trust they are that is bullshit. We have trusted for  months and they have shown NO progress. No hint at any progress other than their word and you expect me to sit here and trust their word again? After  months of bullshit promises and redactions? No way. That is foolish and unreasonable. They deserve to get shit major shit. They should be fired at this point and a new team all together should take over.  year of alpha where content is not added and actually content is REMOVED is not alpha. Alpha is content and features added and hashed out. Major bugs addressed and beta is for fixing bugs before full release. This game and team is a joke.

Melee BR cant happen till hit reg is better sometimes weapons pass right through without anything because of lag desync or just bad detection.

I get  fps consistentlyeven after a couple of hours of playing. We get patches every  weeks which is nice as well. Not a hacker in site. Base building is awesome.

6855444,0,t1_d0taap8,They have a test server purely for the fact that some people cant handle early access and cant wrap their mind around the fact that an unfinished game will have bugs and glitches. Therefore its easier to have stable servers and test servers that have an excuse to be buggy. Otherwise this sub would actually be worse than it is now.Most people think we are players and cant grasp the idea that we are in fact testers. If this were any other alpha I have been apart of there would be game breaking bugs and week long downtimes which is normal but this community is not mature enough to handle those types of thing.I mean they already bitch about a few hours of downtime.

Because of this I asked my price advisors to give all current suggested prices a onceover relative to recent market activity before we reenable price voting.I just went over most of our suggested prices and compared them with trends of marketable items of the same rarity and also their prices on OPskins taking into account that those prices are generally considered to be  of actual perceived values.While there are one or two that may seem low to you we will have suggestions open up asap.,h1z1,d12aqbw,1,t5_31a08

Or start going crazy after finding the same pair of shoes with some color variations in every third house.And adding the Crate skins into the survival loottable wouldnt help either nobody in the real world would want to wear most those colorful clothes anyway.We want to help you and to be honest even though it might sound bad suggestions and feedback doesnt seem to cut it.,h1z1,d185v8h,1,t5_31a08

But theyve ammobuildings like they farm all day  people. Kill someome with  explosive arrows and  shotgunrifle ammo is self explained.But that dupe hack is obvious in just survive dont mean that these player use ESPaimbots. If they can use sw for duping they use the same software to ESPaimbot on KotH. I know that lot of guilds isnt planting and they raid whole server if they want with unlimited indeed they raid  a day.Just survive have less players and less. And at some point hackers stop playing survive and gonna go to KotH to pvp.Game is broken battle eye isnt working and hackers are doing his stuff. Im gonna play other game for sure. Its a bad feeling farm hours day while all people are duping in seconds.

You can NOT defend the devs with their own words when they have proven time and time again that they can not keep it. You are simply on here dev kisssing. Just stop it already. We are not fools Daybreak MADE this engine and you defend them on the fact they can not fix their own engine!? Do you realize how ridiculous that is? Expecially after they hyped so bad about how easy it will be to host thousands of players on a HUGE map with this perfect engine they have. Please.Yes Daybreak released the game way to early. But you are failing to point out that they did this ON PURPOSE. They ramped hype up so high hell they had set a date to just announce the release date. They knew what was happening with SOE and decided to capitalize on the name before the sale. Then they did nothing for a year nothing but monetize. So this too early excuse is not an out for us its another nail in the coffin. For some reason everything they promised and some of what they showcased is suddenly broken and not able to work on this engine? Enough with the excuses. Especially from you. If the devs had anything in their pocket to showcase progress they would have. Your excuses are only hurting the progress by allowing them an out. They need to preform or fail. They have not preformed so they DESERVE to fail. This game should die.,h1z1,d1d55sa,4,t5_31a08

Maybe there is a small glimmer of hope that this can be saved.Stats wise look at wipe day the servers are packed. Maybe with this knowledge they need to come up with something.

7173914,0,t1_d1t8nt7,Otherwise players will do exactly the same they already do with guns. If there will be a slot for tiny weapons they will stop using combat knife wood axe machete hatchet because those weapons will still using a normal slot then you have to choose. Should I carry a pistol or a machete? If the tiny weapons described do the same amount of damage players will prefer to carry guns instead a melee because they will have this background tiny for them. They already do the same with guns. Example Since the crafting ammo system do you see players carrying AK or AR? No.. because they wont spend bullet component to craft  bullet for AR to deal  of damage. They rather prefer to spend bullets components to craft Hunting rifle or shotgun ammo because hunting rifle does  of damage and shotgun in close combat is  shot to the death. Thats why ppl just use the combo Shotgun  hunting rifle. And I particularly dont want to create a new similar system. Thats why Ive suggested this way.,h1z1,d1tlut7,1,t5_31a08

7188879,0,t3_4dv8yp,Id like to see smithing but more as a response to the environment and circumstances than for breaking down bullets. If manufacturing has broken down worldwide and there arent going to be any more bullets then people would need to learn or relearn how to make weapons and armour to protect themselves from zombies. A full suit of articulated plate would make you immune to zombie teeth and claws though maybe not to gas or explosions. Halberds or pikes would be a lot more effective than trying to get close enough to brain someone with a machete.I know theyre not going to go that route but it would make for some cool advanced craftingsurvival gear. ,h1z1,d1vbbk4,1,t5_31a08

I honestly thought the new map was being saved for the new engine but its not. its being pushed for now so that we can play on it until the new engine is ready. They are stalling  which is what a lot of companys do . Development is not being stopped on anything. Its slow  or seems slow  because they are touching all areas for the things.

7358357,0,t3_4g4zwn,The biggest reason would be that they want to get the map playable and gather feedback on its setting and layout but they cant easily do that for survival because any changes to the map terrain and layout require a server wipe. People would not be happy if there was a wipe every week if they changed or added to the map.KOTK never needs to be wiped because nothing is persistent so they can add the map to KOTK unfinished and get feedback on bugs and layout and iterate on the feedback very quickly once the map is more complete and iteration slows down then they can add it to Just Survive but any changes to the map or additions thereafter would have to wait until the next wipe before being implemented.Aside from that there is also a lot more work that needs to go into the map after layout is complete to make the map function properly for survival mostly spawners ambient triggers POI markers and such.ampnbsp  Edit To add to this they could always add the new map to the Just Survive Test Server as a separate PVE serverzone so we can play around in it and explore it and then just wipe it every time it needs to be wiped but not wipe the Z Test Servers.Actually I implore the devs to do just that! ampnbsp  ,h1z1,d2elfdg,12,t5_31a08

7378872,0,t3_4g9pxk,since everyone is reminiscingone of my fist times playing I set up camp in one of those campground areas surrounded by short rock walls. thought it would be a cool place to start a small camp live in a trailer then eventually build a base over the whole thing. well one day this guy shows up. well call him half squat. i thought he was there for trouble so i threatened him with my machete. in retrospect i did not realize how nonthreatening a machete was. nonetheless little half squat was intimidated. he put his hands up and backed away. i looked him up and down realizing he was not a threat. I brought him to my camp and showed him my secret stash of water makeshift bows guns with no ammo and useless melee weapons in a hole in the ground. i told him to take what he wants and that we will be eatig and going out on a supply run. I was so excited. i had a new mute friend. half squat and i were gonna fuck up the world. I started cooking deer steaks on the campfire when a shot rang out.i was dead.shot in the back of the head while cooking dinner.how could you?? i thought. how could little half squat do that to me?? i left the cam on my dead body as i watched a character standing over my corpse looting it. FUCK YOU MAN i helplessly shouted at the figure. Then another person walks up. he was working with someone else. i was even more betrayed. son of a bitch.. but then i realized something. the character that just walked up was half squat. and he was just as confused as i. he looked at my killer then down at my corpse then back at my killer. he realized what had gone down. GET HIM HALF SQUAT GET HIM i shouted as he stared at my killer who was preoccupied with looting my corpse. he couldnt hear me. the killer noticed and came to putting two shots into little half squat. he then took the things i gave him and left our bodies lying on top of each other.i never saw half squat again.RIP half squat,h1z1,d2gxd72,1,t5_31a08

Woohoo! A motorcycle helmet! A pistol! I guess that would depend on ones own tastes. Im staying primitive as possible for now.And its fun! Challenging. Thirst and starvation are very real problems now so I have to hustle to work things out.

In real life youd do your best to get around people and conserve ammo since its a finite source. All you will do is attract attention and you will fuck yourself over.          Helmets should tank bullets. There can not be one powerful gun that is unstoppable. The gun needs to be balanced and that helmet balances it. Honestly I have seen people  someone wearing a helmet and kill them in one shot. I can actually do the same to zombies wearing helmets. I do sometimes hit the helmet and only it blows off but most of the time its a  hit kill.          the  the M then  Magnum and the  are actually the only balanced guns in game.

7451391,0,t3_4hacur,I watch Infection Podcast every week and they go through the numbers every single week so I hear what the numbers actually are. You can also check the statistics of how many people are currently playing and the high number for the day in Steam. Your assertion is not correct. The game certainly isnt hemorrhaging players.  And theres always posts about people abandoning the game. Drama Queens will be Drama Queens and they afflict every single game forum with someone or the other dramatically announcing they are quitting this game or that game. Often times with long well written lists of everything they think is wrong with the game. Its all very entertaining.Is anyone still playing Survival you ask? Well yes. The answer is yes. Im sure you werent actually asking just being rhetorical but lots of people are still playing. I still play I play this game more than any of the other games I own and have had and continue to have great value for my money. Its an open sandbox that I enjoy. What will I do today in game? Who knows but Ill be engaged and interested. Of course it will be fun but then I dont need to be led about so Im okay in a sandbox game. And this game doesnt stay the same and it continues to evolve so the game play actually changes. The people in the server I play in also find entertainment in what they are doing in game and that changes. The people change the activities change the relationships change. Its just a blast and fun to play.  Your thoughts about your post being removed seem interesting. But then I find conspiracy theories interesting. I once talked with a fellow who was certain that the government was watching him specifically and he pointed inside his mouth to show me where they had planted a transmitter in his tooth. Of course I could have tried to convince him that the government wasnt after him but ha you know who can argue with someone who finds conspiracies and plots around every corner. I eventually told him that the best way to deal with his issue was to act as normally as possible so if the government was watching him theyd lose interest in him. I doubt that satisfied him. You know conspiracies are much more interesting and engaging than the truth. ,h1z1,d2p6cqr,-1,t5_31a08

7486242,0,t1_d2sxcab,The render distance tells the computer to render what your computer knows about within the given distance. The thing is that the server stops telling you about nearby players beyond certain distances. Moreover small objects will LOD down to simpler meshes possibly dropping to a null lod where it is no longer rendered because it is for all intents and purposes subpixel.We change and tune LOD distances for performance but its not something you can change yourself. We also tune network awareness range server telling you if something is even there and it is something you can not change.The farthest network distance is reserved for large objects  planes basically and thats in the  range as others have noted. Items are in the  range. Players are  or so and ground vehicles are  or so. Dont quote me precisely on these numbers  they change as we tune for performance and gameplay impact and Im recalling from flawed memory. I just want to give insight into how it impacts your gameplay.tldr beyond the largest network distance render distance is just for static environment.,h1z1,d2t58ex,3,t5_31a08

7589795,0,t1_d34t0v9,Using a Repair Garage already in the game i.e. Bubas to fix a broken vehicle. Yeah... thats silly idea. What was I thinking.I guess the thought of having to actually take your hoarded vehicle to a repair garage with the need to defend the area as the vehicle slowly gets repaired certainly wont help with gameplay.

7603087,0,t3_4jg4hc,You have good points. The problem really is only on PVE because once people have the cars secured there is no way to get them. So they could decide to only apply these new concepts to PVE. If they implement timer values that can be set at wipe time they could effectively exclude PVP servers from the effects of this by simply setting those decay values to some huge number eg  months. As for your other ideas on keys and other vehicle parts those might be good ideas and hopefully well see things like that down the road but those will take a lot more time to develop and test vs putting in the decay timers.,h1z1,d36fjvf,3,t5_31a08

Problem with this is if you are tabbed looking inside your inventory when it finishes opening it glitches and show crate inventory instead of items. So if u exit inventory or just hit tab before the search ends itll open normally.

Ive read that the noclip protects you and containers from damage and access but also read and heard that the protection kills illegal occupants. I did a quick search and only found a couple of comments validating this but nothing official Read the last comment. There was a period when people were logging in and dying instantly and I thought this was related to that noclip feature. OP writes Any shelter or shack that has a door with a code will instantly kill a cheater when they no clip into it if that door is closed.I havent encountered a noclipper in person since before the protections were implemented so I really dont know.,h1z1,d46r1m0,1,t5_31a08

7972211,0,t1_d4c441g,Finding someone who is stuck can be done using the environment.  This requires some skills and knowledge.  No big deal unless you dont like to do those things.   Im about a mile south of cranberry maybe yards from the road near the campsites  This is how the game was intended to be played.  There was a blog post explaining all the ways they intended players to use to navigate the environment posted in Jan  but it has since been removed due to the addition of map grids and magical HUD grid coordinates.  The other scenario finding something youve hidden can also be done without the loc command.  Use the pirate method.  Paced steps from a landmark for instance.  Using loc for this is much easier of course but it is magical gps and has no place in a survival game.  gtIve played the game since Jan . Things come and go in this game all the time. I dont think its time for this to go.I guess you just prefer easy mode then.  Nothing I can change.  I stopped playing the game since the big dam patch because Ive been waiting for a challenge.  The long dark has been barely satiating my survival appetite in the mean time.  Simple game but its much more fulfilling than Just Survive is in this genre.   Just my personal preferences again though.  I like challenges rather than being spoon fed.

8053087,0,t3_4pi7j2,After the first release i was finding decent quantities of higher quality ammo in lockers and around pv and cranberry the dam and military base. This was amazing and it made me excited for the update. However after the loot spawns were adjusted again i simply do not find high quality ammo anywhere but cranberry again. In fact loot spawns seem  identical to what they are now on test server. Which will be god awful since we wont be able to craft ammo anymore.Tldr Not enough higher quality ammo,h1z1,d4l8r01,1,t5_31a08
8053707,0,t3_4pionq,People are sometimes invisible amp silent when exiting cars for AT LEAST  seconds. I have h on test server and died twice to an opponent who was completely invisible and making no gunshot sounds yet I died to an AR  shotgun on killfeed.Cars can randomly turbo forward when you enter them and not stop until you spam W and press S again.The game allows you to craft a makeshift armor when you are WEARING the tan backpack if you have the ductape and helmet crafting consumes the ductape and helmet but does not craft the armorCamera will sometimes shoot in a random direction when exiting vehicles or landing in parachute jumpshotting can also result in crosshair shooting into the sky jumpshotting is basically dead anyway Leaving a vehicle never feels consistent anymore where you get ejected or where your mouse is positioned.Game feels way choppier than before same or even higher fps but much choppier than regular H even with same Nvidia settings AND useroptions. This one is going to be harder to quantify it feels exactly like the last patch when everyone was super choppy in PV and they released a fix for it a few days later.The patch feels okay combat mechanics are VERY different something has definitely changed regarding head hitboxes as removing a helmet and headshotting a player is FAR easier than before. Current live version removing a helmet is very easy but following up with a headshot feels extremely RNGthis does not seem like issue on test server. Could just be me but I feel like shots register faster ? and less reset on AR specifically between shots player combat definitely feels better and rewards aiming more BUT shooting players in moving vehicles feels insanely strangeinconsistent? Will have to get back to you on that one! My main complaint in this new King of the Kevlar patch is that it just encourages farming spawned kevlars at officeshospitalmilitary over everything else and taking longer range duels to avoid getting tapped..the whole new crafted shit in general is not something I am a fan of personally but as long as combat mechanics stay good and z gives better fps I will continue to enjoy playing..EDIT I know it is not as realistic BUT allowing armor to be crafted with Motorcycle helmets also should be a thing as it stands why would you EVER want motorcycle helmets? You would want all tacticals including spares incase you need to craft armor so all the tac helmet skins will go up in price and motorcycle helmet skins will no longer be wantedwill devalue. ,h1z1,d4lb9k1,1,t5_31a08

8097339,0,t1_d4ptfbz,You are forgetting about recoil. Spraying with the AK at any range but your barrel being a foot from their body is awful. It has vertical recoil with slight horizontal movements too.MEANWHILE the AR still has pure horizontal recoil meaning its worth spraying at any range beside player render distance. Upclose an AR will outspray an AK and because of the stupid recoil of the AR you will likely kill people before the AK kills you. Especially now that each take  shots to kill.So either the AR needs a nerd to not have stupid recoil or the AK should get its old fire rate back so it can be worth picking up. ,h1z1,d4q7pgq,1,t5_31a08

8132158,0,t1_d4tw6f5,Yupp thats how I got my baseliving started on this most recent wipe. I farmed up enough explosives to raid a couple shacks did so and got a great amount of lootmaterials to start a base.Not really a viable strategy as most shacks now a days are just going to be used for storage of small things or someone just starting out who might not have much. But at the start of server wipes when people store everything they have no bases up yet inside of them they are a great target to gain material.A big thing when constructing a base is where youre farming the materials to construct it at. The best place imo is the Misty Peak Dam it has TONS of metal sheets pipes scrap metal crowbars axes and everything else youll ever need to construct a base where cities like Pleasant Valley Cranberry and Rancho are probably going to have more players roaming around causing you to lose all your supplies by potentially being killed. Not saying you wont see anyone at the dam but most likely itll be less populated and who knows maybe you can even get a kill or two and add their loot to your shackbase!Tan military backpacks are located in the dam building itself along with body armors some guns and like I explained before all the metal your heart desires. Youll see tons of pipeslead pipes and what youre going to want to do is start a shack nearby the flat part of the dam and start melting those pipes down into metal bars. x metal bars   metal sheet a very important material to construct a base. The great thing about this area is all these pipes youll find in the buildings respawn at a really quick rate. All you have to do is walk far enough away from where youve looted and give it a good minute to respawn. So after you loot the dam platform where all the pipessheets are located you can run to nearby smaller pois like the  cabins industrial areas inside the dam itself and the rvcamp site to let everything respawn while continuing to loot the area.Remember to place your shack closeby to these dam buildings so you can deposit and come back to continue looting. With this method and depending how much you may die to other players you should have enough materials to cut the time to construct a base by A LOT! All the metal is there for you on the dam crowbars to bash cars will be located in the building with the red toolboxes and trees well theyre everywhere lol.Once youve gathered enough loot to throw down a deck foundation thats where you start the process from little shack to bigger base! I know Ive given a lot of information here and some of it may be confusing if youre new like you say. But I definitely suggest you familiarize yourself with the Misty Peak Dam area and try starting out over there.Best of luck man and always feel free to respond here or PM me with questions.,h1z1,d4u4lzd,1,t5_31a08

Game crashing when switching weapon slots might be due to switching before thereloading animation was finished.

8193633,0,t1_d51pivd,Look at where the gun is compared to where the camera. Gun is at most at eye level ADS or at middle of the player hip fire. The camera is a couple feet above the player.Draw two parallel lines shown in this photo will show you why dick bullets exist. If you put the bullet coming out of the camera then the bullet matches where the aim is but it creates an issue of inaccuracy if you put the camera behind the player it needs to be at the same location as the origin of the muzzle which is why there is a zoom,h1z1,d51r7zo,4,t5_31a08

Also the removal of jump ADS makes no sense since it actually takes skill to due it you cant just listen to the bad players because they get killed by itThe new skyThe new sky is the only thing that couldve made the game even more laggy then it already is.

Im on the east coast and normally play between PM  AM. Not sure why you dont think its possible to do this. Those guys chasing you with an axe or machete...well my bow generally finishes them off pretty easy..I completely understand that you and lots of people like you want a server where you can use your sniper all day without actually having to put yourself in any real danger. But the majority of us enjoy not having to worry about everyone they see having a sniper. I mean the gun is OP af. I mean I love the . But I dont want to feel like I HAVE to bring my sniper just because everyone I see has one. As far as getting a server just so people can break down rounds...Well servers arent super cheap.

Thats where the logic fails.. If you apply bandages and then run it cancels them yes? Healing and running isnt allowed yet you can still move... So now what would you suggest youre not able to move until its been applied? No you just wouldnt.Like I said if its got to the case youve used the full clip you should switch gun slot  fist to apply bandagesheal.. THEN switch back to reload.,h1z1,d6kzu3z,0,t5_31a08

Id recommend getting a lot more game time before making a montage and the editing is just putting clips together. The clips are very boring to watch also... Most of them are drawn out and you have the obvious advantage. The fade black after the most impressive clip makes me think you died shortly after. Near the end you said you needed more loot when there is one person left and you have a nearly full bag of loot.But Im glad you are having fun with your friends and I do want you to keep filming and making videos just maybe try a whole lot harder than this shit. ,h1z1,d7bn68y,1,t5_31a08

What happened instead? They split the games in  for  each and now once KotK actually gets released it will cost . That was one of the first outrages but people got over it in the end. Then after the split? They shifted their whole attention to KotK and completely ignored Just Survive. They ruined one of the games just so that they can milk money off the other. If you think Just Survive is fun then you obviously havent played it back in the first few months of release. The game is almost dead at this point. And now?

Because why not? We have icons and indicators for everything else!? Next thing you know it will be KoTK Modern Warfare  where its just run and gun and everything else is taken care of.Part of the reason KoTK is a good game with great potential is the difficulty and level of depth of keeping track of your own items ammo gear and survival elements that are integrated into a fps.

Z wasnt garbage purely on the fact that it worked for testing gameplay but it definitely should never have been considered the primary map for launch. Imagine if instead of developing Z exclusively they prioritized networking issues. In any case hopefully that goes into their main focus now.,h1z1,d8mh26j,1,t5_31a08

9286892,0,t1_d8t5fik,Z will be brutal for pvp. I promise.There is plenty of REALLY REALLY rank killboxes and some of them will even likely not count as POIs making them very attractive for clans to completely use for their personal bases.That said I do agree that at first and the following months pvp will be very sparse even on high pop servers until everyone grows into the maps geography.Once people start to REALLY know the map pvp will start to gain steam based on the fact people will figure out what places have what amount of traffic.I can already see PV being a fair good bet for assorted pvp battles.On the other hand I can also see places like the D Dragon Lake Compound and all other forts similar to this one becoming hotly contested buildzones. Those who do decide to try to take these will surely be facing the prospect of having to defend often.While I do agree the vastness of the map makes pvp more annoying through less random encounters I think you will find that in time that aspect will sort itself out just fine.,h1z1,d8t6idn,1,t5_31a08

9352024,0,t1_d913luo,Then Im gonna give you my opinion on the scoring system right out the gate. Royalty Leaderboards grindingYou get less than  points for kills early game. You gain  points killing second place. The whole competitive scene with streamers are all about getting the highest kill win. Their challenge aint winning a game its getting most kills. Or rather its getting high scores which they all believe most kills will grant you. But the difference between points from kills throughout the game vary so much that a game with  less or even fewer kills can grant you more points in the end. Were all fine with kills granting more towards the end. But the current system is ridiculously skewed.  late game kill will grant you as much as  early game kills.Then you gotta ask yourself if the skill of getting that one kill late game outweighs over  early game kills. The loud and clear answer is no. Winning is the goal and that alone should grant most points as it is now. But kills should matter as well and kill count should matter more than when the kills occurred. There is Zero incentive to play aggressive early game. Its as if you believe every kill early game is on someone without weapons. That is only  kill if youre lucky. Then you might run into geared guys while you have a pistol yourself. Kills early game is just as skillful as late game kills but youre rewarded trash for some reason. ,h1z1,d91fq5e,6,t5_31a08

9757360,0,t3_5evl4r,A lot of the items in this game should be rebalanced.  As it stands there are  arguably  weapons that have a use at all. AR AK Shotgun Sniper.  The revolver is also arguably useful because of how much damage it hits a vehicle for.  All melee weapons the bow and xbow and the other existing pistols are relatively clutter finds on the map.  There are a few scenarios very early into a game where you scramble to pick up a weapon at the start to try and kill somebody who landed with you but other than that i have never heard of a pistol taking priority in your weapon slot over the above mentioned.  Stun grenade and smoke grenade could also use a boost.  Movement speed would be pretty cool on the lighter melee weapons as well anything except axe which should be stronger,h1z1,dafta0d,1,t5_31a08

Most other games i get between  FPS on k with mine in crossfire and the game arent optimized for the AMD kernels.As stated i am very happy that the game is finally receiving some attention still i little to slow for me when its still a  game technically  if you want both but as stated I am still happy that the game is still developing and I am truly happy as long as it is.ThanksJoe,h1z1,dbgyg2s,1,t5_31a08

10220538,0,t3_5mae4u,At this stage I dont think its a good idea to release the server software to the public.Doing so in an unfinished state of development will allow people to reverse engineer the server software in order to identify vulnerabilitiesexploits that can be used for cheating mostly in temporary code segments waiting to get rewritten properly and securely for final release. This would cause the general development progress as a whole to slow down since resources would be wasted to scramble a most likely temporary solutionquickfix to handle the cheaters which in turn is likely to cause a more spaghettilike and poor quality code overall thats much more likely to contain additional vulnerabilities which would then repeat the evil cycle.For a hack creator its much easier to exploit something when they have it inhouse.

10469330,0,t3_5puqud,Hello I understand your frustration with car stealing. First of all dont try to keep a vehicle if you cannot safely park it in a base. So first thing to do is build a nicely closedoff base so intruders will be kicked out to eventually park your vehicle in it.Keep a storage container full of keys spark plugs batteries fuel and wrenches. That way you can always bring a keyplugsbatteryfuelwrench with you in case you find a vehicle.I suggest looting on foot especially if you have lots of people around you. Also I like to use an ATV on metal runs. Stop loot go. Repeat. Or having a driver is nice too. Make sure to have your vehicle locked at all times to avoid unwanted travellers.Another thing Ive done is build  garages around the map so I can park my vehicle in a safe place while I loot.And remember to fix your vehicle with a wrench every day or it will despawn within  hours!Good luck!,h1z1,dcut0m9,2,t5_31a08

11299833,0,t3_6169pj,Repairing bases with the new melee system takes a long long time.And the character stamina drops way too fast in my opinion faster than running across the map. Also the damage to the hammer is a bit excessive. It will take oodles of hammers and some kind of crack stimulant just to do routine base repair.Is there any HZ crack? grins LOL  megabase repairs...Base repair might not be an issue though because you need to be able to cut trees and get scrap metal to build anything. I like others have mentioned cannot even connect with the trees. No tree hugging here Regardless of position or proximity to tree and trying all cutting tools.After countless swings I only connected twice and lost a sh!tload of stamina so I gave up trying to chop trees... I am guessing trying to get scrap metal with crowbars will have similar results...Rapid loss in character stamina and rapid degradation of whatever melee being used  the new melee system could be a great way to stop mega base building!hehehe!Seriously though I WAS laughing for real when just trying to repair my base!It was just too absurd that it almost killed my stamina before I noticedLOL I was like WTF?

11671164,0,t3_66abp8,i cannot recommend this game in its current form. They have fixed alot of annoying bugs but thats pretty much it.  They keep saying they are going to give us new stuff well its  months later and we are still holding our dicks in our hand with them saying soon soon. Id say wait a bit longer. Its not worth it right now.,h1z1,dgixxn8,3,t5_31a08

11692715,0,t3_66m3jj,For all the complaining about realism in the game I am actually quite surprised to see so much hate for this patch. I mean ghostly gates that can pass through solid objects? I fully realize WHY the complaints are happening Because no one wants to have to learn to playbuild differently. Youre only comfortable with what you are used to and any change to that is scary. Reminds me of the deck skirting issue  base ejection fix happened. When that happened you people were losing your damn minds. It was going to be GAMEBREAKING and everyone was just going to rage quit. JS was going to lose every player they had because of it...Yeah right. Its going to be just fine. Well figure it out. Im setting up a shack out in Runamok on every server and that will be the safe space where we can all congregate and hug until the gate hype passes. See you there!,h1z1,dgldyko,7,t5_31a08
11696149,0,t1_dglghfw,To protect their loot. The more shelters raiders have to blast through the more materials theyll need to do it. If you have a megabase but you only keep your loot in one part of it without cheating or using exploits theres no way of knowing where that loot is. So the larger the base the less likely smaller clans are going to try to break into it. It wont be cost effective for them.This change wont affect me personally but being able to build with things colliding such as a gate through a shelter was one way people could keep their loot safer and avoid building giant bases at the same time. So I understand why people are upset about this change.,h1z1,dglrz86,3,t5_31a08
