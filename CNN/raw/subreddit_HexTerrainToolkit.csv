11383447,0,t1_dfm61nm,Yes and being an avid scenery builder I have to say its one of the best  I spent. My one gripe is I wish the guide bar was a little longer to better account for cutting larger pieces but other than that I really like it. P.s. I havent used any other cutting table. So I have nothing to compare it to. ,HexTerrainToolkit,dfmaly7,1,t5_3hv00
11427170,0,t1_dflt1oq,I did back the kickstarter at the highest tier which included the simplified hex replacement for the cogs.It was an active decision on my part to make assembling the terrain simpler at the cost of a little more overhead when creating the hex.  The theory being that trying to maintain two different styles of cog could get complicated down the road.  Do I have different collections of grasshillcliff hexes I only use around the edges and another for the center  never shall these pieces intermix?  Do I need to have cogtosimplifiedhex L adapter for certain places?  Do I only use the full cog for the bunkers houses and shed pieces using the simplified hex for all full hexes?The last one seemed the most practical because if the two separate styles are visually different half vs full hexes it would be easy enough at a glance to keep them separate.  Ultimately I preferred the simplicity of knowing that all of my connections have the highest possible interlocking capability.  Now that Im as far into the project as I am its sort of too late to even consider changing it up given how many fullcog hexes I have unless I cut ALL of them in half and start fresh which would set me back a fair bit.I hope I dont regret the decision!,HexTerrainToolkit,dfr9anu,1,t5_3hv00
