1187829,0,t3_27m01c,Excellent! Thanks for the write up a coworker and I have been playing around with his and were still wondering what features were undocumented.,shortwave,ci38zt8,1,t5_2sh51
2540291,0,t3_2osdk1,Thats the University of Twente one right? The people there on the chat are very friendly and weve experienced a lot of cool things specially on UV!  Anyway those lines look like ionosonde ones but Ive never seen them curved like that. It it actually possible to follow the signal increasing the frecuancy but its relatively hard and pointless.  That said Ive been in the shortwave world less than  months so maybe a more experienced user can give you a better explanation...,shortwave,cmq5hva,1,t5_2sh51

3977190,0,t1_cr9l38g,The tuner might be acting as either a lowpass or bandpass filter somewhat  which if you have nearby broadcast stations that are desensing your receiver in general would cause the radio to be a little hotter with the tuner in line.,shortwave,cr9mt4m,1,t5_2sh51
5472669,0,t3_3pzibs,gtI did try some SSTV decoders with some of the random digital signals on m and m I think? without much luck. Oh yeah for SSTV...try these frequenciesm khzm khzm khz they only run narrow SSTV herem khz and khz sometimes digital SSTV on m khzThere are others...just google for SSTV frequencies. Oh...and SSTV is mostly analog though there is a digital variant using a program called EasyPal. But beware a lot of ham operators run EasyPal in a hybrid mode...where it basically sends a URL over the air and the people pick the photo up off the internet. It supports actually transmitting in digital but these guys love hybrid becuase its quicker even though its not really SSTV. Just dont tell them that becuase theyll call you a nocode lid who knows nothing. Digital signals largely sound like noise...analog SSTV sounds like a chirping noise.,shortwave,cwb6o4k,3,t5_2sh51
6066278,0,t1_cydtba7,Im guessing fundie Christians on the radio arent that rare in the US of A but here its easier to to catch some Islamic broadcast Iran or Saudis I think I heard one from France too than a Christian one. Fire and brimstone welcome!,shortwave,cyes43y,1,t5_2sh51

6845133,0,t3_49eys8,Im not sure what you mean by car adapter... are you talking about a V power adapter or do you mean some kind of AUX adapter to get your radio line level output to your car stereo?I have never tried it so I could be completely off base but I have always assumed a car would generate too much electrical noise to make SW listening enjoyable. I know there are a few car stereo head units that have SW coverage but still seems less than ideal.... Good luck!,shortwave,d0s7aae,4,t5_2sh51

11078015,0,t3_5y0thy,I heard magic over and over in this segment and I admit the magic is what got me interested in radio. Im an extra class ham hold a GROL and have worked in satcom and audio video with a lot of other hams.What I think needs to happen to revitalize shortwave broadcast radio is to have car shortwave receivers become available and common. ,shortwave,denoleo,4,t5_2sh51

11743163,0,t3_67b6m7,Return your broken unit.  Dont even mess with it.  Get one thats new and doesnt have damage and missing parts.I had a unit like this on Guam.  Not this model but close. It was just fine.  Start with success and then you can move on.  I always start with a time station like WWV  there are several and due to their mission always broadcasting across several bands.  See  for a list. For the best results go outside with the units antenna extended fully.  Under cover of the forest is slightly less optimal but better than inside a building.  The more sky you can see the better even though leaves and trees and roofs dont completely block signals they just weaken them somewhat depending on the moisture and thickness of the cover.  Once you know its working then try moving inside and external antennas and such.Hope that helps.,shortwave,dgr48hn,3,t5_2sh51
