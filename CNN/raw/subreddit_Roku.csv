878615,0,t1_ch400w1,Heres the real reason Amazon is jacking up Prime prices.The real reason for Amazons price increase is that it has been giving away a video streaming service roughly equivalent to Netflix for free as part of Prime Dawson writes. Given the rumors about Amazon launching a music streaming service as part of Prime as well it seems far more likely that Amazon is recognizing that it cant continue to ignore the high costs of giving away so much content for free any longer. That model has broken Amazons usual model of aligning its own interests with those of its customers as the more users use these services the more benefit they receive and the higher Amazons costs.Feel free to shut the fuck up with your bootlicking apologies for Amazon any time now. The simple FACT is that Amazon has the resources  more than the competition to be blunt  to code up an Android app in whatever variants are needed. This is fucking AMAZON whose servers are so robust that even Anonymous had to openly surrender in their attempts to DDoS them. If they released an Android app the gains theyd make from people signing up for Prime would cover the dev cost before lunch the first day. Are you actually trying to foist the retarded notion that Amazon doesnt want a few million more users to shell out a hundred bucks a pop because it wouldnt be cost effective? Five million new Prime users would be a HALFBILLION DOLLARS! Amazon cant be bothered to go after that money?Fess up who is typing the replies for you because youre clearly too stupid to not urinate on the keyboard much less properly punctuate the drivel youve been spewing? Funny how Redbox whose streaming service sucks and their major segment is renting plastic discs at the supermarket kiosk can make an attempt at supporting Android but Amazon its merely a helpless giant.Cant wait for your next selfbeclowning queef of blather excusing Amazon for specious and ludicrous reasons. Actually I can. ,Roku,ch45hgm,1,t5_2rxgs

1503101,0,t3_2bcoi0,When I compare the functionality and costeffectiveness of the Roku to its current competition I find it to be the best of the bunch even if it has been crashing on me around once every several hours of video play for several months now.I did have an annoying audio problem with Pandora music for a while but an update to Pandora or maybe the Roku OS I dont know which finally seemed to fix that.Our ISP is Charter. Our Rokus we have three Roku  XS boxes all had the memory upgrade available from Roku at time of purchase. Theyve all got around  carefully chosen free channels on them plus one paid one Netflix. In the Netflix app we might presently have  or so items in the list. So why are our boxes regularly crashing? Well the crashes didnt start until a bit after I began seeing news articles about ISPs around the country secretly throttling Netflix to coerce Netflix to pay them money. So I strongly suspect my ISP although the crashes arent restricted to only Netflix I sometimes see them streaming different channels too. Maybe weve got too many channels on our box? Or one or more of them is badly written and causing garbage buildup in memory? Or perhaps theres a bug in the Roku OS? I thought for a while it might be we have too many shows in the list inside Netflix but that shouldnt cause the crashes in other channel apps right?The crashes occur on Rokus using wired Ethernet connections so its not a wireless signal issue.I provide all this info in case someone smarter than I might be able to figure it out.,Roku,cj4or38,0,t5_2rxgs

Unless youre looking at a lower quality stream on your pc than the roku and dont have a fast enough internet connection to stream it but the Roku should select a lower quality stream. Yea the legality of the site is a grayarea. Basically they ask for donations so they arent charging for the service but they still could be taken offline. However I heard they are located in Sweden or somewhere that is a bit more lax on copyright laws. So it could be taken down but isnt super likely from what Ive read.

3476052,0,t1_cpogihr,gtI was asking in rroku of all places because I wasnt sure if there was some advanced user interface for the Roku that I wasnt aware of yetYou misunderstand me. There isnt an issue with asking in rroku the problem is with your incessant whining rant. The problem was you insulting rroku for not wanting to listen to your whining and your fantasy that youd get a different response in rnetworking to your rants. You would get eaten alive in rnetworking on this issue. You asked your question and people gave you good advice. Your rants about hotel wireless even if they were accurate have no place here. You should have stopped while you were ahead. gtFor every nonstandard hostclient handshake scenario? Not possible.Person after person has told you this is fucking standard at hotels and common on lots of guest access networks. The same solutions work at any place Ive ever tried themand I literally had this problem the very first time I ever encountered wifi at a hotel  years ago. Im sorry but if you havent learned your lesson youre a fucking moron. Captive portals have always existed and likely will always exist. They are not random or uncommon.gtany network administrative policies that not only break established protocol policies going back to ArpanetCaptive portals dont violate any protocols and are de rigueur for guest wifi. You will not find any protocols that require anybody to support every device and in fact such a thing is impossible. Youre wrong. And the problem is even if you were right this still isnt the place to be complaining about it. Take it to rnetworking where maybe theyll be more patient educating you. Here are  links on the topic over there where you can start learning about them. Its a common solution as Ive stated and I dont think youll find anybody there claiming they break any protocols. Better yet start at the Wikipedia pageWhatever you do just go away. ,Roku,cpohuhe,3,t5_2rxgs

Because Ive had Test Participation turned off since long before it started and they told me that was standard and couldnt be turned off months ago.But what I came looking for today is that as of yesterday or so when I hover over anything on the main screen after ten seconds or maybe less it starts playing an ad for it. Mostly these little slowed down snippets from the show or movie with incredibly cheesy instrumental music playing over it. I dont think everything has those yet but Im going to guess its at least  of them. I let one run all the way through last night and once the promo ended it just looped and started playing again.Im guessing they roll things like that out in waves or something so if youre not seeing that yet just wait.And make no mistake about what these are Theyre ads. Netflixs UI is looking like a crappy early s website complete with pop ups and banner ads. It gets junkier and more annoying all the time to the point that Im finding it almost unusable.

10198698,0,t3_5lzdsh,My only problem with the Roku platform which I think may come back to bite it in the ass is the reason it all works so well in the first place. All apps are implemented in the proprietary language BrightScript. This seems to have allowed Roku to have concrete control over runtimes app performance and the overall relatively smooth experience most Roku devices have despite meh specs. They were able to really optimize the experience for their own tooling.The problem is that most if not all of the apps out there just simply follow a template. Theres no diversity and theres no way to create a truly nice experience because the tooling is so barebones and rigid. Case in point the Spotify app on Roku It hasnt been updated in years and it doesnt support any of Spotifys new features. For a comparison heres what the Spotify app looks like on the FireTV Stick. The devs cant really do anything more because the tooling doesnt really allow it. I dont want to completely defend the fact that the app has been left alone for several years but I could certainly see why. No one really wants to throw the manpower at a platform that requires its own specific tooling and is quite restrictive and I think that Roku could certainly offer the ability to use HTMLCSSJS to create apps and preserve performance.,Roku,dc02v39,4,t5_2rxgs
10228183,0,t3_5lxp6s,The real issue with HDR is finding quality content. A good number of shows just dont have that many scenes where HDR is a must. Most directorial approaches and visuals come from mellowing and sublimation of a certain color palate for a given scene. You may be able to find HDR photographs that use  or  bit color as a better side by side comparison. I wouldnt count on needing HDR to enjoy the content of k streams these are always compressed from their original and are inherently lossy.To answer your question HDR is not particularly a musthave feature for the high end roku models but they do have it to play with.You would benefit more from an HDR display if you are gaming on high end hardware with your TV. I suppose this is less of a concern for the high end roku models.What theyre really trying to say with this support is that those models fully support such formats regardless of what its being displayed on. Therfore if the only thing you can get is an HDR stream and you dont have an HDR monitor then you can still watch it because adherence to those standards requires a degree of backwards compatibility in those stream formats.,Roku,dc3f73f,1,t5_2rxgs

10569179,0,t1_dd6284x,I did. Like I said I wasnt getting an IP address so I never got to the point where DNS could be an issue. I got it resolved today or at least found a work around. The issue for some strange reason was the DHCP server on my Cisco RV. I brought up wireshark and could see DHCP discovery packets from the Roku but there was never a response. I put enabled dnsmasq on the raspberry pi thats running pihole and the Roku came right up. Every other device I have works with that DHCP server including other Roku versions and every other DHCP server Ive tried works with the Roku so I dont know which side has the bug. I would guess its a combination of both. I included as much detail as I could so you can get this to your tech support team and hopefully save someone else some time.For the record this is one of many reasons that every device needs the option of static IP. Even if this turns out to not be Rokus fault it still took me about  times longer than it should have because Rokus dont have the basic functionality that every other IP based device in the world has.

If Im using the Roku remote the interface for adding text is aweful so unless Im selecting from few prefab options that Ive preconfigured itll be a pain to make selections. My phone is both faster and has better input features and I dont need to stop watching my show to use it.
