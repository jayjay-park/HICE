3074854,0,t3_2vdevr,There are currently four A teams in my dynasty Im in my sixth year in NCAA  Alabama Oklahoma Miami and Buffalo my team ofc.I won  games in a row upon moving into the BG after my first season. One of my recruiting classes involved  star players. I won  straight COY and National Championships but then when I only won the Rose Bowl after going  my Coach Prestige dropped to B.I had a slot receiver with  speed who had  receiving yards in one season. He played significantly for all  years as my team rose up in OVR rating finishing his career with  yards. He won the Heisman twice.I have been messing around with the conferences a bit. The Big East is a dogfight with ND and UCF added to it. The MWC is now BCS too and is flourishing with the addition of the best WAC teams. The WAC and Sun Belt are now completely horrendous.

4195637,0,t1_crycx7b,Thanks for the quality answer. . Following up on  do wide receivers actually fight for the ball or at least come back to it in ? My biggest issue with  is that theyll so often just wait for the ball to come to them and let the DBs pounce on it so Im forced to user them to have a better chance to get the ball which Im still garbage at.. Following up on  how do you feel about the changes to recruiting? I heard it was more streamlined but Im not really sure how its different. Do you still add players to your board and call them up each week? . Isnt there an XP system in dynasty now? How does that come into play? . The Big East was phased out in favor of the American Athletic Conference did that make it into the game? . Last question unless I think of more later. Youve been really helpful so far and I really appreciate that. Anyway is there a slider for injuries now? Ive been playing Madden  and on default settings injuries are way too frequent. I lost every single TE my starting QB and HB and two WRs by week  but after adjusting it its been a lot more realistic and less crazy.I love dynasty mode its what keeps me coming back to  and whats making me hesitate on getting . I think I might have as much time playing that as I do with games like Skyrim and Fallout. Im just curious to know how its different and better rather than just hearing that its better like Ive seen in every review.I didnt expect it to be worse or anything but you can never be certain with EA. I really like  I feel like its miles ahead of Madden  so Id be willing to shell out the cash to get  if its worth it and it seems like it is. I think my local stores are preying upon the fact that there isnt going to be anymore games so theyre keeping the prices up.

Complete with a mock schedule cross divisional permanent rivals and a mandatory power  opponent. It was a hell of a lot harder than I thought it would be to maintain traditional rivalries while also adhering to the schedule rules. Some of the permanent rivals are kind of bland but  of the teams are relatively new to the conference so natural rivalries dont really exist within conference.

7279229,0,t3_4f31r1,Sorry if this is a little long Ive been meaning to post in this thread for a while but always miss it. This is my main coach right now almost  years have passed on this profile. I recapped his career in the other section.Schools West Virginia OC  Years  Penn State HC  Years  Houston HC  YearsNumber of Seasons  Coaching Position Head CoachRecord  Custom Conferences YesGame NCAA Other Season Recap Stuff Pat Johnson is a coaching prodigy leading West Virginia to  BCS Bowl wins and Penn State amp Houston to  National Championships. He began his career at West Virginia leading the Mountaineer offense to a better record each year. In his third year Texas would upset the Mountaineers on a final drive in Morgantown to steal the Big XII title and keep them out of the championship. In his last game with the Mountaineers his offense rolled over Ohio State . He would accept the head coaching position at Penn State his alma mater the next day. Pat would have immediate success at Penn State going  in his first season winning the Outback Bowl over South Carolina . His next season Pat would have to change his game plan and focus on defense. This would prove successful as it led the Nittany Lions to a Conference and National Championship. The Nittany Lions averaged just  points a game but held their opponents to an average of  points per game. This season included five shutouts  of which were on the road Temple Notre Dame Rutgers and a  victory over Notre Dame in the BCS National Championship.After winning a title for his alma mater Pat came to the conclusion that he could never overcome the legendary shadow of Joe Pa. Pat wanted to have a legacy of his own and resigned from Penn State  weeks later. Just  days after his resignation Pat Johnson agreed to become the head football coach of the Houston Cougars who were part of a new expansion team for the Big XII.Johnson has dominated at Houston going  over his first  seasons. He has a strict policy of instate dominance making every game against anyone from Texas more important than the others. Pat has so far kept it perfect going  in his first  years. His take down of Texas in Austin was when the sports world began to take his team seriously.His first year at Houston culminated in an  record again a team focused on defense. The Cougars manhandled opponents offenses allowing just  points a game. The Cougars would pound their way to  victory over Missouri to win the Cotton Bowl Classic. In his second year offense would improve to make Houston even more dangerous. When paired with the Cougar defense Houston was unstoppable roaring to a  title season. Teams averaged  points while Houston averaged nearly triple at  points. The season ended in a  victory over Pats old school and alma mater Penn State. The Nittany Lions fumbled the ball on the goal line to seal a Houston title.In his third year Pats Cougars entered as the  team with an even better offense. Once again they ran to the title going perfect again. The season was highlighted by monster wins at  Texas AampM   South Carolina  at  Texas   TCU  and finally  Georgia Tech in the title .The Cougars averaged a downpour of  points a game.In his fourth year Houston continues to seek success on both sides of the ball. Pat has slowly shifted his team from defense first to offense first and hopes to claim a third straight Big XIV and National Championship.,NCAAFBseries,d25lllw,1,t5_2tx3z

8679825,0,t3_4yoq1v,Schools LSUCoaching Position HCPrevious Schools UTSAHC Miss. St.OC USAOCNumber of Seasons Record Custom Conferences NcontinuationWhew its been a while!  Since my season began so horrible on defense as had most of the previous years I finally took the time to settle down and create a new Defensive philosophy and better manage my offense.  First I changed my defense to a more personnelbased system.  That meant using a base  odd scheme and subbing CBs for LBs to match the number of CB to WR through Nickel  and Dollar.  This didnt really make sense on paper since my previous  and  scheme used more SS which actually had better coverage stats but... whatever.  Turns out it worked a lot better.  I also began keeping better track of my plays and focused on keeping  pass plays per game  run plays from my starting HB and  running plays from my backup HB.  This worked great to help my offense stay balanced keep my players fresh because auto subs simply dont work and it actually helped me in the passing game a lot.This is the hardest schedule I had in a long time so my defense had to be top notch.I picked up this new scheme against  ranked Mississippi State.  Although their DEs were killing my tackles and making life hell for my QB the offense was unstoppable and the defense played lights out.  My new scheme worked wonderfully and I blasted them .Next came another home game against  Tennessee.  The first half featured two stellar defenses that demanded precision and timing as evidenced by a  score that featured  turnovers and a th down goal line stop.  Each team scored a touchdown in the last  minutes of the half when things got hairy but also had their turnovers during that time.  Although Tennessees defense had shut my halfback down in the first half he led a long drive that ended with a big  yard rushing TD that got my offense moving.  On the next drive Tennessees QB gets injured on a bad read option and their backup cant handle the pass rush.  By the time their starter came back in the forth it was too late and a lot of desperate sloppy plays ended with an INT and  fumbles.  A star was born at defensive end as he had  tackles for loss  sacks and a forced fumble to help hold Tennessee scoreless in the second half and defeated .Up next was an away game in The Swamp against  rival Florida.  The first half was a defensive clusterfuck as Floridas defense smothered my passing game and manhandled my offensive line but my defense forced an INT and a fumble inside my  yard line to end the half .  In the second half Floridas defense fought even harder and led to mostly  and outs.  Their offense began wearing out my defense and moving the ball but an INT in the middle of the th quarter led to a touchdown and killed their hopes.  My star defensive end had  sacks in the game to tie with Floridas entire team and I escaped .The following week was an exciting matchup a rematch of last years national title between me and  Notre Dame!  Sadly my star DE was a menace and destroyed Notre Dames offense line forcing bad throws and INTs.  In fact one play saw him drop back into coverage and smash the receiver that caught the ball so hard he forced a fumble AND LITERALLY BROKE THE RECEIVERS BACK.  A  halftime lead saw no changes in the second half and led to a disappointing game ending .A cupcake home game came next against Maryland who not only were missing their QB but also their HB.  My star DE gets  sacks my defense gets an INT and a pick  and my s get lots of practice in a  killing.Next up was Aggie Speed!  Texas AampM always has the fastest players and its always bothersome.  They are also super lucky.  The first half I had several forced fumbles but TAMU got it back every time.  I also had lots of dropped picks.  TAMUs pass defense was lights out but their run defense was food for my HB.  Their offensive line was holding up well but the lack of a run game held them to a  deficit at halftime.  After halftime I swapped my kick returner because my current one was muffing catches a lot and the first kickoff of the half my new returner returns it for a touchdown!  From there TAMUs defense fell apart.  My star DE registered  tackles all for loss  sacks a forced fumble and a safety but TAMU still put that speed to use scoring  touchdowns.  The th quarter saw an attempted comeback but it was too little too late in a  game.Then came Bama.  Bama has had a series of bad years after Nicks retirement but I dont care what their team rankings are their defense always plays me hard.  The first quarter both defenses dominated.  I scored a touchdown and drove the ball into the redzone a second time but their defense picked it off in their endzone and returned it for the longest pick  in history.  The quarter ended  and I was pissed.  The nd quarter I drove the ball into the red zone again and on a th and  I called a read option which had killed Bama a few times already and my QB took it to the house.  Bama faced a th and inches at the  on the following drive but I knew what they were going to do and stuffed the run for a turnover on downs.  The nd quarter Bama fell apart and the half ended .  The rd quarter showed Bama come back to life as their defense held me scoreless and their offense started moving the ball.  Things were starting to heat up after Bama scored a TD followed by another  and out but their next drive stalled in the red zone and their kicker missed a  yard field goal.  That play ended their comeback hopes as my offense wore out their defense in the th.  As Bama got desperate they began making mistakes and the score got away from them.  A close  quarters ended in a crushing  victory for the Tigers.Next was the Magnolia Bowl a yearly beatdown of Mississippi.  Mississippi needed to win  of their last  games to become bowl eligible but I was not one of wins.  Although their QB gave me fits this one was never close.  The th quarter saw me make mistakes as I tried to get a lot of passing yards to impress the QB I was recruiting but even with  INTs in the th I still won .,NCAAFBseries,d6qlolp,2,t5_2tx3z

In comes Blake Richards who graduated from Nebraska back in the early s. Blake wants to make the Cornhuskers a dominant team again and we will see if that can happen.Week  The start of a new season for Nebraska and the first game for HC Blake Richards. Does he have the smarts and football knowledge to lead this team? We will see this season! We  host Wyoming in the season opener and it was a pretty even game throughout going into the fourth the score was  in favor of us. We ended the game in the best kind of way scoring a lot late. We scored  points in the fourth and win it .Week  Another game in Lincoln as Southern Miss will take us on. On offense we played decently our passing could have been better and our running was fine but on defense we just gave up too many passing yards. That is what cost us the game in the end. We lose .Week  Still in Lincoln and will be until week . We host UCLA as they try and get revenge on us after we handed them a bowl loss in . Well they did get revenge. Our defense could not stop the pass again and later in the game we were so gassed we could not stop the run either. We lose .Week  We play against an FCS Midwest team this week and an easy game is what we need to boost the morale of this team. It was not as easy as we wanted in fact FCS Midwest were winning in the fourth until we scored  to their . We win . I am not proud of this win even though we won it was embarrassing.Week  ByeWeek  For the first conference game of season for us we take on Illinois. Like other games so far this season it was a close one and one too close for comfort. Illinois were ahead heading into the fourth but we rallied and scored two touchdowns to take the win .Week  Oh yeah we have to play a game not located in Lincoln for a changePurdue! We are coming to you! I think this is the best looking game performancewise since week . We did a tremendous job running the ball and that accounted for most of our points. We win it .Week  ByeWeek  We are heading north for this game against Minnesota. We were hoping to get away from the close games for a little bit but I guess Minnesota had other plans. We were trading back and forth but we eventually came out on top with a close  win.Week  This week we play against Northwestern. This game was a pretty boring average game to tell you the truth. The outcome is basically what you would expect from two decent football teams. We were good enough to win though . We moved to  in the rankings!Week  We travel to Ann Arbor for our toughest game to date  Michigan is always a team that has a daunting presence but we need to put that aside and focus on doing our jobs! Conversion is the name of the game. Simply put we converted on third down and Michigan struggled. Tommy Armstrong had a surprisingly good game passing the ball throwing for  yards and  TDs. We move up to  in the rankings only three spots for beating the  ranked team in the nation. Complete BS.Week  A nice and easy game after Michigan? No! We play against  Michigan State. Luckily we are playing at home. Unfortunately that did not help. We played in the first half but in the second half Michigan State took over and did not look back. They win it . We fall back to .Week  We are heading to Pennsylvania to play against our rival Penn State. It was a rainy miserable day in Pennsylvania which means that it is a great day for football! This game was really close and if the stars had aligned just right it could have had a crazy finish. Late in the fourth down  Devine Ozigbo ran the ball for a short goal line TD to tie it up at . Our defense put their asses in gear because we stopped them with about  seconds left in the game. We throw the ball a few times to get closer but with about  seconds remaining we were out of field goal range. Tommy Armstrong connects with Jordan Westerkamp for  yards but he was pushed out at the yard line! OT here we come! Our defense stepped up big time after Terrell Newby ran for a TD and we win it . We move back to .Week  The final game of the season and it comes against Iowa. Iowa is always a tough team for Nebraska to play against and they proved it right in this one. They did not have a spectacular day but they kept us off the field long enough so we would not gain any momentum. We lose . Back to  Week  ByeBIG  Conference Championship Michigan State  vs. Wisconsin Bowl Week vs.  Texas AampM in the Gator BowlWe were given the opportunity to extend our season by one more game and what better way to send off these senior players than to win a bowl game? Texas AampM is a tough team but we are ready. Both of our defenses played well as we both were under  in third down conversions. For us though our running game helped tremendously. If Newby wasnt running with the ball Armstrong was and it worked because Texas AampM were not prepared for that option attack. We win the Gator Bowl .

Port Neches TX. Karl is an athlete but he is best when the ball is in his hands. He can play defense but I think an offensive position would suit him well. We can juggle around a few ideas if he signs with us. Committed Regular SeasonChanged to WR QB Jermaine Brown   lbs. Tupelo MS. With Tommy Armstrong and Ryker Fyfe graduating we are in need of a new quarterback. We believe that Brown is the guy to do that. He has great feet and with his ability to move around in the pocket it opens up many options for us as a play is breaking down. Committed Regular Season MLB Andrew Washington   lbs. San Gabriel CA pipeline. Washington is a great pass rusher and run stopper but lacks talent in the coverage department. We are okay with that as long as he is willing to learn that aspect of the game. Committed Regular Season FB Leon Harris   lbs. Dentsville SC. We need a fullback and he was one of the few who was interested in us. Committed Regular Season WR Jared Woods   lbs. Woodland CA pipeline. Nabbing Jared would be great for this team. We had a lot of receivers leave the team for graduation and the NFL so adding him would help our lacking WR corps. Committed to Arkansas ATH Scott Brooks   lbs. LexingtonFayette KY. Brooks is listed as an athlete but all we see when he plays is wide receiver. He has great release and good hands to go with it.

11510749,0,t1_dg0751n,Week  ByeOur total stomp of MSU a ranked opponent brought us from  to .Week  MinnesotaMinnesotas defense did a good job holding our offense back from busting out a monster performance but the Gophers too couldnt get past our defense. We had a few stumbles near the beginning of the game  namely a fumbled option pitch that bounced off a defenders helmet! which gave Minnesota great field position and put them just a few insanely acrobatic catches from scoring a touchdown. However after that they had no luck. They did come up with some good plays on defense and forced a few punts but when you can only put  points on the board your defense is gonna be hard pressed to carry that kind of weight. Once again our defense which is rated lower than last year and had been a source of concern coming into this season absolutely dominated the opposition and led to a comfortable victory. NU  Minnesota .Now finally ranked  the undefeated Wildcats are looking forward to what should be an easy win against  Iowa and then a crucial BG West showdown against   Nebraska. In the meantime over in BG East land Ohio State is leading the pack. Its too early to tell but if the Cats can knock down the Huskers and make their way to the BG Championship they may be in for a battle against the hated Buckeyes.Elsewhere UCLA is finally not at the top of the rankings instead being down at  with a  record. The top  are currently. Northwestern Wildcats . LSU Tigers . Oklahoma Sooners  about to face LSU in a  vs.  matchup!. Florida International Golden Panthers . South Carolina Gamecocks . Ole Miss Rebels . Houston Cougars . Kentucky Wildcats . Virginia Tech Hokies . Pittsburgh Panthers The rest of our schedule for this seasonWeek   Iowa Week    Nebraska Week   Wisconsin Week  Maryland Week  Purdue Week  Illinois Week  ByeThere dont look to be any exceedingly strong opponents on our schedule since we managed to avoid scheduling a lot of the scarier teams in the BG East. If we keep performing like we have so far this season it looks like another BG championship and maybe even national championship may be in our future along with a bump up to Heisman difficulty. Seriously these sliders have hurt my passing game but theyve turned my defense from one of the worst pass defenses in the nation to the undisputed best.,NCAAFBseries,dg0qtyk,1,t5_2tx3z
