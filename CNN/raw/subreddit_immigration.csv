37004,0,t1_cehg8w0,Heres what you fail to understand a civil violation  a crime.  Thats not some obscure distinction either.  People who cross the border without documents have a number of legal rights most notably the right to apply for political asylum.  Since for a majority of asylum seekers there is no other way to enter the country other than entering without documents labeling them as criminals is not only technically incorrect but it is also violative of the spirit of our international obligations. Moreover one of the major reasons the right to a criminal defense attorney was written into our constitution was due to the stigma associated with being convicted of a criminal act.  By labeling all of the people who cross the border without documents as criminals youre stigmatizing them without allowing them the proper constitutional protections which is problematic for reasons already described.Basically this is an area where language is really important.  When liberal groups get up in arms about the words illegal aliens or criminals its not without good cause.  Of course you have drones who keep saying illegal is illegal without really understand the important technicalities of the law in this field.  Im not saying youre one of them Im just saying you should learn more about this field before you go around advocating your point of view.,immigration,cein7fm,3,t5_2qvj0

722075,0,t3_22evxz,This is absolutely crushing. I actually bought Obamas line that the government went after criminals gang bangers people who are hurting the community not after students not after folks who are here just because theyre trying to figure out how to feed their families. Obviously when I saw how greatly the deportation rate increased it became obvious that that wasnt the case since immigrants arent hurting the community any more than any other group of people in this country.This is shockinggtThe records show the largest increases were in deportations involving illegal immigrants whose most serious offense was listed as a traffic violation including driving under the influence. Those cases more than quadrupled from  during the last five years of President George W. Bushs administration to  during the five years Mr. Obama has been in office. In that same period removals related to convictions for entering or reentering the country illegally tripled under Mr. Obama to more than .All this said I kind of see Obamas point about how difficult it is to thread the needle and get a bill through Congress but come on. He will never have a perceived good record on deportation in the eyes of the GOP.

In fact several states suffered through crisis in procuring sufficient number of seasonal farm and harvest workers. They could not even be replaced by convicted felons who could not get any other job and who had to work or risk violating their probation. If these undocumented workers were to be replaced with workers earning proper wages youd see a significant rise in prices. If youre that concerned with illegal immigration you could start paying more for groceries eating out and housing to start. You say we take care of the poor people. We do.

2330995,0,t3_2lzafg,The Cato paper mentions the other study under Comparing Studiesgt A study by the Center for Immigration Studies CISfound that immigrantheaded households with children used more Medicaid than nativeheaded households with children and had higher use of food assistance but lower use of cash assistance. The CIS study did not examine the average value of benefits received per recipient.gt There are several reasons why our study differs from CISs study. First CIS did not adjust for income so the percent of immigrants receiving benefits is higher in their study in part because a greater percent of immigrants are lowincome and all else remaining equal more eligible for benefits. Noncitizens are almost twice as likely to have low incomes compared with natives. We focus on lowincome adults and children because public benefit programs are meanstested and intended for use by low income people. It is conventional in analyses like these to focus on the low income because it reduces misinterpretations about benefit utilization.gt Second CIS focused on households headed by immigrants while we focus on individuals by immigration status. Our study focuses on individuals because immigrant headed households often include both immigrants and citizens. Since citizen children constitute the bulk of children in immigrantheaded households and are eligible for benefits CISs method of using the immigrantheaded household as the unit of analysis systematically inflates immigrants benefit usage. For example  percent of U.S children receiving Medicaid or CHIP benefits are children in immigrantheaded families and  percent of those children are citizens.gt Third CIS focused on immigrants in general including naturalized citizens while we also included noncitizen immigrants. Naturalized citizens are accorded the same access to public benefits as nativeborn citizens and are more assimilated meaning their opinions of benefit use are more similar to those of native born Americans. Separating noncitizens from naturalized Americans gives a clearer picture of which immigrant groups are actually receiving benefits.,immigration,clztobb,3,t5_2qvj0

5165549,0,t1_cv8m6ad,What usovietracism is saying is that applying for adjustment of status in the US requires you to show that you have a visa number currently available and that you qualify to adjust your status in the US. In general you cannot adjust status if you are not in valid i.e. lawful nonimmigrant status at the time you apply. You also cannot adjust status if you have overstayed your admission or you have worked without authorization. See INA  c It sounds like both of those are true in your case. What options you will have to claim status or a visa abroad when your number comes up will depend on what the law looks like in  years. If nothing changes you would most likely have to leave the US and either wait out the year bar or if you have a qualifying relative by that time apply for a waiver.

7175975,0,t3_4dsarc,Interesting legal case from  an applicant for adjustment of status can remain in the US for years without any additional lawful immigration status. If their application is approved they can receive a green card with no problems. But if their application is denied then all the time spent without an additional lawful immigrant status is retroactively deemed unlawful which can bar them from reapplying for adjustment of status or from reentering the US if they leave.Strangely parolee status might count as lawful immigrant status so if an adjustment applicant has advance parole but never uses it they might be at a huge disadvantage compared to someone who briefly exits and reenters the US once a year just to enter on a fresh parolee status each time.Just goes to show how convoluted and inconsistent immigration law is and adds another way for USCISs long processing times to screw over innocent people.,immigration,d1tuc6c,3,t5_2qvj0

And whats worse than having no credit history is having a short credit history loaded with defaulted debts.Finally  there is a standard of good moral character that is part of the naturalization application. I am not saying that stealing from these companies by refusing to settle the debts will definitely block your friends from naturalizing one day but it might.You should recommend your friends to work out payment plans with their creditors and settle their debts.

If while you are here you get a job offer and they meet the requirements for sponsorship and they are willing then you can actually start the sponsorship process here since the priority dates for job sponsorship are pretty quick. You can check them on the U.S. department of state website under visa bulletins. The are a law called I think k which gives you an additional  month grace period on top of the  month visa allotment. So you have almost a full year to get the process done. If it all goes OK and quickly then you can get possibly a green card in the United States if not then you need to go back to avoid a  year bar and wait for the visa in your home country. Also HBs suck i am not referring to that i am talkimg abput the process to change your status from a tourist to a permanent resident directly.

Ive done one which they reopened within of month and one that has been pending for over  months now. Practically speaking an appeal to the AAO also serves as a motion to reopen or reconsider since the process requires that the officer review the decision before it is sent to the AAO. If the officer changes hisher mind then the case is reopened at that stage. Filing a motion to reopen also does not toll the time you have to take an appeal so doing a motion to reopen is essentially giving up your right to appeal. Im not going to second guess the attorneys that worked on the case since there might be something in the decision that makes them think a MTR is a better strategy than an appeal.,immigration,d83qrwr,1,t5_2qvj0

10698419,0,t3_5t1fb8,gt As far as I know green card is through job sponsorship marriage or the lottery. Can I just switch to a green card after Hb on my own ?You are correct however two of the employment based categories dont actually require help from your employer EBA and EB NIW. Theyre harder to qualify for I think you need at least a masters preferably a PhD but you can read more about them hereYou would probably want a lawyer if you go either of those routes because they have experience in documenting your skills in the way USCIS wants.gt no I do not want employer sponsorship from my current employer. I rather go back.Have you considered switching employers? HB transfer is a lot easier than initial sponsorship because theres no cap  lottery. If you can find an employer who will sponsor your green card soon the sooner the better then you can go the regular employment based route.,immigration,ddjgnkr,1,t5_2qvj0

11466053,0,t1_dfvmwwq,Totally understood youve got to do what works best in your situation. For what its worth yes the timelines sound really long but its not really that bad. And youre totally correct on wanting to do this right because there are a lot of pitfalls along the way.Also big silver lining is that you stand a good chance of being allowed to visit which is something that most people going through this process do not have. My husband and I opted for the usually much faster fiance visa. Fiance visas are faster because their order of events is apply for visa get visa cross border marry apply for green card. Spouse visas are  marry apply for visagreen card combo get visagreen card combo cross border. The holdup is the green card which takes  months which is why fiance visas are ish months faster than spouse visas.Anyway we were UNlucky enough to apply at a period of time in which USCIS was sending the applications to two different offices based on the applicants zip code not based on how many applications they received or how many staff members each office had. End result was some people were getting through the USCIS stage in  days others us were  months. For a process that is supposed to be  months start to finish. Ours took  months start to finish AND were were one of the quicker couples in our applicant pool. My husband is from a country that doesnt have the luxury of visafree travel to the US and having a US citizen boygirlfriend fiancee husbandwife makes you look too much like a risk to stay and adjust and so people in that situation are routinely denied tourist visas. We essentially spent the entire first year of our marriage because once we were engaged and making immigration plans and choosing between marrying or strategically staying just engaged  youre in deep enough that youre basically married in different countries with me visiting about once every  months. And even that wasnt so terrible.It sounds like youve got a lot of back and forth planned over the next year or so and you ARE eligible to visit its just not guaranteed youve got to make a case for each crossing. Visajourney can totally help you with best strategies to prove that you intend to return to Canada so that you can visit. ,immigration,dfvo5a4,1,t5_2qvj0
11492623,0,t3_63yaw5,A few things You can probably do a SKYPE consultation with a US based immigration attorney. Many offer that service. You say voluntary departure  does that mean you were in deportation proceedings and were granted voluntary departure or does that mean you decided to leave one day? You dont state whether your girlfriend is a US citizen  is she? Do you have any criminal record? Do you have more than one illegal entry into the United States? Are you currently outside the US?There may be a waiver available to you if you have a qualifying relative USC spouse or parent and you can show extreme hardship. If you are outside of the US the consulate will tell you which waiver or waivers you need after your immigrant visa interview. You cannot file a waiver from outside the United States without direction from the consulate.,immigration,dfyoro6,3,t5_2qvj0

11574662,0,t1_dg7l2c5,Correct if you enter with a Visa or enter legally and then overstay you may do the process called adjustment of status which is much easier than what we had to do. For those who come in illegally there is something called the ia provisional waiver which is  spouses of citizens or residents who have only one illegal entry you must send evidences that you deserve to stay in the United States and get residency and that if you were to be banned which the minute you leave the country you automatically get a ban usually  years for having been in the US illegally but this waiver is to waive it but you have to send them evidence that the ban would cause extreme hardship on your family.  I have very complicated health problems and do actually rely on my husband heavily and we sent in our evidences and we were approved and we simply went to his Visa appointment and he was able to come back legally and was sent his green card in the mail.   This process is called ia and is done within the United States and theres the regular waiver which is called the I and is done in ones country of origin.  This new waiver available in the United States came into effect in ,immigration,dg7zsme,2,t5_2qvj0
