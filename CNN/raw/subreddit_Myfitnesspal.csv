8376497,0,t3_4uap8m,At a certain point in your weight loss you wont be able to healthily sustain a  calorie deficit. This may be that time.My TDEE is . It wouldnt be healthy for me to only eat  calories a day. So Ive started adjusting for .lbs per week. Im a female so my minimum is  since females generally require less calories but I eat more than that. And if I really wanted to which I dont right now I could add in exercise for the other  calories per week so Im still ensuring proper nutrition bu I also lose at whatever rate I want.I would not recommend eating less than the healthy amount for a male though just to lose faster. That sounds like it would be bordering on unhealthy thinking regarding foodnutrition. ,Myfitnesspal,d5om111,4,t5_2swj9

9111175,0,t1_d86vsoo,Most people would agree I think that you should NOT eat back the calories you burn off. Eating back the calories will slow your weight loss down. As you lose weight your TDEE will drop because there is less of you burning those calories so even if you have been consistently losing while eating around  a day you may reach a point where your weight loss plateaus after losing a certain amount after a couple of weeks of stalled weight loss you can try to adjust your calorie intake to account for the slow down. If youre unsure you can try pretty much any approach as far as your calorie intake and just monitor your progress to see what happens. If you lose weight you know you are on the right track if you maintain your weight you know that you can afford to eat fewer calories. If you gain weight you should definitely reevaluate your caloric intake or your activity level or both. ,Myfitnesspal,d870ksw,6,t5_2swj9

10243536,0,t1_dc41y0z,So my point is this  I rent a house that is almost  years old. The cabinets are original. So I would need to put money into a house I dont own in order to use this? Second point  if I take a can of tuna out of the cabinet I wont be putting it back. Ill either be eating the whole thing or eating half and putting it in the fridge. Will the fridge then know that the half can of tuna is replacing half of the tuna from the cabinet? And what about the weight of containers? What about spillage? Humans arent perfect. Edit Just to be clear I applaud your ingenuity and I really think this is a cool idea. Just giving things to think about!,Myfitnesspal,dc55twe,1,t5_2swj9

10465913,0,t3_5pwlb6,Eating more will not help you lose weight faster thats not how this work.  It will however make you feel better have more energy etc.    For your height and weight even completely sedentary your expected TDEE is in the neighborhood of  kcal a day.  At the deficit youre talking about you should be losing something like  lbs of mass a week.  Some of that is bound to be muscle mass.  Changing your intake to  kcal a day would change your expected mass loss to about  pound a week and help you maintain more muscle mass.,Myfitnesspal,dcuf1v1,10,t5_2swj9

11371417,0,t1_dfiexbw,Overshooting and going way below what you need might cause the body to go into shock and emergency mode and store everything as fat because it is worried about where its nutrition comes from.
