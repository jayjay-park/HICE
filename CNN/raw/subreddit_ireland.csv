If I want to spend all day picking up a particular song on the guitar or learning X language great for me... Its my choice. Doesnt mean it should be obligatory for everyone who doesnt want to.Edit apologies in advance became more of a rant than anticipatedOn why Irish people hate Irish and being taught two nonenglish languages at once  We already are taught a nonenglish language French or German primarily two very useful languages.   However the way Irish is taught the exam is very much like the an English exam with deep responses on poetry novels etc. expected from people who have at least a lot of the time a basic grasp of the language. I remember people in my class who had attended gaelscoils and were fantastic Irish speakers still rotelearning their responses for poetry and stories as well as straight up learning off possible essay topics. These were people who could come up with a high level essay on the spot regardless but it was better to learn off because you can guarantee a high grade. This was even more true for those who were not as fluent. Learning Irish was a memory exercise and that was all it was.  Producing essays without thought or understanding. Hell I did pretty well in my Irish LC and I really couldnt hold a simple conversation with someone in Irish a couple of years later... gtYou say were better off teaching them a useful language. I say why not do both?  Ignoring than the fact that we are already doing this why teach Irish? I mean surely the burden should be on those claiming we need it to demonstrate the need rather than the other way around? Finally I am absolutely fascinated by the Irish language and the historical culture of Ireland but the Irish I learned and used in school is not that. It was pretty basic Irish used for several years to describe storiespoemswhatever instead of spending time improving it. Even worse it was basic Irish made up mostly of English words converted to Irish often in place of actual Irish alternatives. Despite the fact that my French learning didnt have so much in the way of deep stuff like novels poetry and the like Id easily put my French as at least  times better than my Irish I could hold a proper conversation in it and understand a quick fluent speaker of most dialects.,ireland,cfe6mis,5,t5_2qhb9

389013,0,t1_cfl2735,I dont think you know what you are talking about.In  the central bank established the CCMA which was further developed with the MARS in order to address mortgage arrears. Following the civil laws act  the revised CPC  the personally insolvency act the revised code of conduct on mortgage arreas and the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt there is now extensive legislation and protection within the system. The sale of mortgages to a foreign investment groups is very much removing the protections of the home owners.It is not my words when I am talking about working with the home owners it is the requirement of the central bank the NCA the financial regulator and the recommendation of the Keane report and expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt.The mortgage arrears resolution process requires lenders to apply the MARP framework which sets out four steps communication with borrowers obtaining financial information assessment of the standard financial statement and resolution so they are very much obligated to work with the home owner and no that does not mean debt forgiveness.It is just a guess but Im not convinced you actually know anything about the reality surrounding mortgages and loans and the regulation of the same as you seem to just assume that Irish regulation is a black and white handshake with the result of Cant pay your mortgage? Fuck you fucker!The transfer of mostly performing mortgage contracts to groups with no obligation to this process is very much throwing debtors to the wolves as Enda Kenny himself has said borrowers will have no protection against the hiking of interest rates.,ireland,cfl352e,2,t5_2qhb9

462971,0,t3_1zdwr9,Since over the last twenty years you have snidely laughed at my attempts to have you correct a most dishonest and damaging betrayal of me you perpetrated.. and since you smile and mockingly laugh as you stand there accusing me of making you a Random target.. as if you didnt do what you did and as if Im mad.. which you mockingly called me over and over when I was  and as musical flavour of the month you wanted to use me and be around me though you had not an ounce of respect for me. Indeed you were Hollywoods flavour of the month yourself at the time. I recall.. possibly similarly surrounded such is the whores kiss that is show business in Ireland.You would call me mad.. not in the affectionate way but the disrespectful way that pompous Irish celebrities treat those they know cannot lie. They love to mock whom they perceive as the afflicted even amongst themselves. And use the word mad as a term of abuse and a way to invalidate a person and a way to torment them.. Watch the monkey jump when you kick it. its fun for you kind of guys..Secially when the monkey is a girl. You kind of guys dont do it to boys..Apart from Van Ive seen the hugest of Irish artists disrespect Van behind his back. The fucking High priest. They cant stand it. And its because darkness That I define as being spiritual and emotional dishonesty always has to try to kill light Spiritual and emotional honesty and the devil as a Rabbi once told me Is a gentleman.You used to laugh snidely at how upset at twenty years of age I would become when you would mock me like that for being so sad and so messed up because of where I had come from ..saying youre mad youre mad.. And for being all the things your age and ilk of Irish man feared at that time in this shit hole of a country wherein we celebs.. so called successful people.. are nothing but bloated fish in a very small pond.When I was  you were . Thats a big difference. You were old enough to know better than to do what you did and youre still old enough to know better than to stand smugly smiling tonight and tell me that what I am about to repeat here did not happen and that youre just a random target.You know you are a liar. And furthermore to attempt to do that to me to suggest that Im some crazy woman.. as you always did.. and that I go around picking random targets to accuse of such a thing is to completely invalidate the gross injustice you perpetrated upon me which you have refused to correct.. and smiled while refusing.That Sir.. is called abuse. And as the victim of such abuse I am claiming my human right to be heard and acknowledged by any means necessary.. having tried all other means over twenty years.. A man has no business treating a woman the way that you have treated me. And the consequence of what you did has been and remains.. understandably.. traumatising.At NO stage ever in my life before nor since have I suggested that I was offended by any persons offer of love making. I do not pick random targets to accuse of such things. Study the evidence. I have never been that kind of woman. That is a despicable type of woman you are calling me. You dont get to do that and walk way smiling. Or walk away at all.You deny what you did. And you sold me down the river and pushed someone I loved very much and who loved me.. out of my life in the grossest of married man behaviour.Your wife Fran was one of the only  mother figures I have ever had. My sister my granny.. and Fran. I never spent much time with her but she was observant of my youth and was motherly to me on some occasions.. which meant more than the world to me.She took me in her bedroom at the house one day and chatted with me as if I was a daughter.. she is such a great mother she gave me a crochet doilie type thing.. something like that.. that she had either made or bought. She was kind to me. And since I never had a mother.. what Fran may have perceived as nothing much.. in terms of time spent  was in fact was huge and so beautiful to me.At some point approximately  years ago you and I sat on the steps outside my house in Garway Road in London. I believe we had been to some do connected to something we may have been working on with Daniel DayLewis.It was night time. I was very weepy and upset over a break up I going through.. where a man I loved was boning everything that moved.. . You said you couldnt do anything to help me except possibly make love with me. I was upset and sent you packing. Because your wife happened to have been so good to me and because the remark was entirely inappropriate under the circumstances.Over the next few days there ensued a host of argumentative communications between you and I because I was upset at you for saying that when Fran is Fran. You denied saying it. Tonight you say I accused you of putting your finger in my mouth. I cannot remember if I said that or if you did. But if I did say it then it did happen because contrary to what you are trying to make me out to be.. I dont have reason to make up such stories.You denied tonight and you denied for nearly twenty years.. that you said I could make love with you. You did say it. And it is revolting of you to smile all gleamy eyed like George Bush when he talked about violence.. as you barefaced lie into my face and try to invalidate me as a human being by accusing me of being mad.. just because you know its fashionable and easy to accuse Sinead OConnor of being mad rather than stunningly intelligent and braver than any man among you could ever even try and fail to be.Yours is the behaviour of an absolute scoundrel upon this issue.At some point during three or so days of communications wherein I was furious.. as I am now and have remained.. Because you deny saying it.. I sent you a fax. I pre warned you that I was going to send the fax. Tonight you say you have the fax Im now going to describe.. so you must also have the previous one where i warned you I was writing to YOU.In the fax I stated that you did what you did and youre a wanker for denying it.The next time I saw Fran she blanked me and has gone out of her way to blank me ever since. At New York Airport as she walked away with her back to me in disgust.. you stood facing me and smiled your George Bush smile. You had smashed a part of me and it delighted youFran got the fax by accident you say.. and clearly you told her as you try to tell me that youre the random target of a madwoman. And she has believed you.What you have done is a gross disservice to your wife and to me and you owe us both an apology because youre dishonesty ended what had potential to be a very important healing relationship.You didnt want to admit to your wife that you had said it and you sold me down the river. And I loved her and had been standing for her was the whole reason I was angry at you.You fucked me over. And you fucked me over again tonight. Trying to hug me like you give a fuck about me.You owe it to me.. it is my human right.. that you acknowledge you lied. You did say what you said. And the finger in the mouth or not is beside the point. You said what you said about making love and you know very well that I am not a liar.You made Fran think I was a mad woman trying to fuck up her and her poor innocent husband. That is abuse . And how you have handled me over the twenty years when I have asked you to repair your karma on the matter and restore my relationship with your wife who is too bleeding good for you is absolute abuse. As was tonight.You have traumatised me with your lies and your smiling while you lie. That is abuse.You are not getting away with it. I should have written this letter years ago.Ive written it tonight because I told you Im going to tell Fran about it and you cockily said go ahead as if you didnt give a fuck. Sacriligious fool. You cant smash up a relationship that represented light.. and expect youre ultimately gonna get off the hook.The beauty of me is I dont give a fuck. I dont take abuse from men lying down. I will have the truth upon this matter made known to Fran by any means necessary and I choose this letter. Because you will not correct the situation. Because you could no more give a fuck.I should have put your face through a window a long time ago. Consider it metaphorically done. And remember I dont give a fuck. So do your worst. Abusers of those they deem or label mentally ill and who use that claim or belief to take the humanity of the person they deem mentally ill.. and smile at their suffering.. as if it is their delight to have caused it and who triumph in the lie deserve to be stood up to.You will tell your wife that you absolutely did say what you said and the finger in the stupid mouth or not is beside the point so dont play the clever semantics.Im not a piece of shit on the end of your shoe. You dont any longer get to walk away after treating me as you have for twenty years.. Times have changed. Women dont just take this kind of abuse from men. Especially men old enough to know better.In short fuck you.And Fran.. He lied. So youve wrongly denied me.. and what he did is not forgivable.. until he acknowledges it and apologises..for lying and for making me out to be a crazy woman talking nonsense.. the cowardly way out.. which as you will see from the above.. he will not do.Whatever I may be accused of I may not be called an emotionally dishonest person. Neither do I smile if I hurt people. Neither do I fuck with the heads of people seventeen years younger than myself. Neither do I use the craven tools of those who use what they falsely call mental as something which which to get their kicks from hurting people.Shame on you as long as you go to your grave without being honest upon this matter. Your nose reaches from here to Hells Kitchen and back a thousand times. Pinnocchio Sheridan.,ireland,cfsw2xb,4,t5_2qhb9
465946,0,t3_1zfefv,I can understand how you feel my own beliefs seems to be similar to yours. Ive got  experiences that show both sides of how people try convince you to join their faith.Once I was on lunch in Stephens Green walking back towards the entrance to go back to work and a well dressed guy with a French accent asks me do I have a minute. I thought he might need directions so I stopped. He started talking and asking me do I know about Jesus etc etc. Im getting late to go back to work which I try to explain. Next thing he asks for my phone number so we can continue the conversation later. I politely decline take a pamphlet and go back to work.The other side happened when I was waiting at a bus stop. I was alone there and two guys with the white shirts and backpacks Mormons? Jehovahs Witnesses? come up to the stop. One guy asks me when the next bus was so I told him. Then he asks am I religious. I reply not really Ive got personal beliefs but I dont really go into organised religion. I prefer to have my own ideas and let others have theirs. So the guy hears this and has a big smile on his face and says thats really great man and the conversation ends there.I appreciated the second instance of this a lot more because the guy showed respect for my personal beliefs rather than here this is what you should buy into.

You see there have been actual scientific studies that show that fluoride can be extremely harmful if not regulated at extremely small doses.So there is a scientific basis for not wanting too much fluoride.Again comparing those who want more studies conducted on the safety of fluoride is so far removed from the Catholic Church and their antiquated and antiscience policies that again it baffle me how you can mention them in the same sentence.,ireland,cfxitgk,1,t5_2qhb9

You werent at the scene so how do you know the Guard didnt explain to the man earlier why his van was being taken? The man couldve just started rolling the camera after he was told and pretended he didnt know why his van was being taken so he can make them look unprofessional in front of the camera. gt No because now the camera is rolling crucial difference. Theyre taking the mans van probably important to his livelihood. I cant help but think that this would be very unlikely to happen in Dublin . Its such a small deal to just say Yep insurance..The camera rolling doesnt mean the Guard should have to keep explaining why the van was being taken over and over again. Thats assuming the Guard had explained to the man why his van was being taken. We dont know because we werent there. Also I dont what youre going on about D for Im sure if people have no insurance there theyll have their vehicle seized as well. gt Youre reaching to make excuses for this unprofessional behaviour by the guards here.What unprofessional behavior? We dont who is in the right and who is in the wrong here.

But a it doesnt cover things like the notice given when additional overtime is required b it doesnt cover reprimands and sanctions for restricting your availability to times that can fit in with your other commitments and c it is frequently ignored.You may have no problem with the rest but I certainly do.  I have seen it first hand.  I have seen cases where someone is doing their job well covering everything in their contract and their performance goals and more showing initiative to come up with and drive improvements and still they are given a reprimand for not performing to acceptable standards  an appraisal which rules out pay rise rules out promotion for a few years rules out even applying for an internal transfer.  All even though they have outperformed their goals?  Thats not right.The reason is the bell curve and measuring performance relative to peers.  Someone else without family commitments who for instance was only too delighted to take the opportunity to spend a month on a customer site in New York which was simply not possible for the person who was punished.The person who suffered never signed up for a job that required extended travel never set expectations that they would be able to do so and yet its held against them to say that theyre not doing enough?Perhaps your experience has been different to mine.  In the last odd years EVERYwhere I worked has imposed the bell curve  although some didnt admit it to employees  and occasion I was the line manager or middle manager involved.  It might not fit exactly for a team of  but when that gets rolled up to the next level the team of  sure as hell had to fit it.As a manager I have been told that this year we need to raise the percentage of poor performance appraisals to x.  I have seen global redundancy rounds where a poor performance rating in a targeted geographical region meant instant selection for redundancy again no matter how well you have performed against your own goals.Its nothing more than a myth that this sort of thing improves performance.  In fact it fosters cynicism resentment and lack of trust in management  and its a direct competitor to cooperation between colleagues.  More and more companies in the IT sector are waking up to this  see last years announcement from Microsoft that they were dropping it.Youre kidding yourself if you think that the average contract of employment and working legislation provide decent protection for a worker.  They provide certain very minimal basic standards. ,ireland,cgc93qk,1,t5_2qhb9

I say it is a matter of both sides in plain terms simply because the convict in this case will be adducing that X Y Z was garnered from a constitutional breach.  The other side will attempt to refute the matter or rely on the extraordinary circumstance out.On a personal level I am suspect as to whether any of this will work.  As I mentioned in normal situations they are often reluctant to visit old cases with new constitutional arguments.  That said the breach was not known so arguably the appellant could argue that it could not have been raised at trial because it was not known.  From a legal standpoint I think there is merit to this argument however given the public policy consideration that will undoubtedly be weighed I do not think anything will come of this.,ireland,cgdszv1,5,t5_2qhb9

If it is appealed the decision is always upheld since they arent employees.Bad enough that interns dont get paid do the work of paid employees and have to kiss ass the whole time but now you have to accept sexual harassment.Its even more troubling that the majority of unpaid interns are women and the connotations that come along with women doing work for free. Some of the industries that are the worst offenders are fashion and art. But us young people are in a no win situation. Work for free and hope to get a job later or dont work and hope to find a job later. The job market for the youth is tough the world over and the fact many older people are working past retirement age due to a loss of pensioninvestments makes it more frustrating.

893374,0,t1_ch5k0hd,Homebrewer here. No brewing a good beer versus a bad beer isnt generally more expensive unless adjuncts such as rice or corn are used in place of some of the malted barley. I know Miller is brewed using corn so it wouldnt surprise me if Canadian is the same.But other than that barley is barley and hops are hops. Prices may differ for each but cheaper ingredients dont make a beer bad. Its not difficult to make a good beer on the cheap especially if youre a massive brewing company and can get bulk ingredients for crazy low prices.The problem stems from Irelands drinking palate. Like it or not were a country that likes our lighter beers. Theres a reason why Carlsberg Budweiser and Heineken are all lower ABV over here than they are in mainland Europe and the US. The Irish beer mentality is to drink a lot of light beers fast. Those who like to drink fewer nicer beers tend to get labeled beer snobs by people who will then down half a can of icecold Bavaria just to avoid tasting it.,ireland,ch5twzy,5,t5_2qhb9

The word copula derives from the Latin noun for a link or tie that connects two different things. gtA copula is often a verb or a verblike word though this is not universally the case.  A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a copulative or copular verb. In English primary education grammar courses a copula is often called a linking verb. In other languages copulas show more resemblances to pronouns as in Classical Chinese and Guarani or may take the form of suffixes attached to a noun as in Beja Ket and Inuit languagesgtMost languages have one main copula although some like Spanish Portuguese and Thai have more than one and some have none. In the case of English this is the verb to be. While the term copula is generally used to refer to such principal forms it may also be used to refer to some other verbs with similar functions like become get feel and seem in English these may also be called semicopulas or pseudocopulas.gtInteresting Subject grammar Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwciptpy oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteciptpy.

Im finally travelling to Ireland in September and am looking for some interesting things places people I can fill my trip with.The sidebar of ririshtourism is packed full of links to events calendars and ideas of what to do in specific towns both nationally and local as well as geographic specific subs.gt Im interested in th century Irish politicshistory and would love any suggestions that would lend themselves well to that GPO being the most obvious.There are definitely links for threads in ririshtourism to history walking tours in Dublin some are free and youll get to see a bit of the city. Also search in the specific subs in ririshtourism  rireland sidebars such as rtipperary rdublin and ririshtourism for tourist related threads. These questions have been answered literally s of times already.gt Id also love to see a sporting match as well but am having a bit of trouble finding schedules. A cousin of mine played for Kerry County football team decades ago so if someones willing to point me in that direction Id appreciate it.Unfortunately the GAA season pretty much takes a breather in September. Have a look here for GAA fixtures and Ticketmaster for links to other sports events. If you are staying with family it may be best to ask them about lower level matches that are taking place when you are with them there may be a club match on or even a practice game they might let you take part in. Unlikely but not unheard ofgt Note I tried to post in ririshtourism but am apparently not allowed...Its an archive of tourism posts from all the Irish subreddits as such no one is allowed post for info there. The point is to encourage people to see what has already been answered then for them to ask more specific questions in the Irish subs if they cant get joy there. This way the amount of touristy knowledge is added to little by little and those who come after you benefit also. NB  Since they are Xposts you have to click through to the original comments threads are not posted there unless they have salient infoWhen you have a look there feel totally free to PM me for advice or recommendations should you need the help on specific topics. Is this a fair price for this is this any good etc. Anyhow happy hunting and enjoy yourself when you do get here buddy.,ireland,cjbc85x,6,t5_2qhb9

1773161,0,t1_ck2nf6e,Yes Im unemployed and my partner works part time we availed of the social housing during the boom when it just didnt make any sense for us to try and buy a house even though both of us were working at the time. We get the medical cards I also availed of the easy access to college over the last four years we dont pay property tax. No food stamps for us or free electricity or TV licence fee.The benefit these social supports have had for our family are enormous and we appreciate them and recognize how much they do for us while we are on the bottom rung. If Ireland INC did not provide these supports for me and my family where would we be? What would the likes of USamachiii do with us? Should we have been left homeless during the boom should my child have died of measles because i couldnt afford a doctor should i have not at least had the chance of access to a third level education when i could not find another dead end min wage job. If yes is the answer to these questions then it would be quite possible that my family would have become more of a drag in public finances in the form of my being in prison for stealing trying to provide for the family my kids being subject to social services care because of our situation. All of which would cost a hell of a lot more than the few supports the state have provided for us. People who espouse this type of political conservatism should really read some Rousseau specifically  and more importantly   Both works revolutionized how society saw those on the bottom and where the idea of the social care for the most vulnerable in society was first formulated    ,ireland,ck2nu3o,7,t5_2qhb9

Its to create a semistate company that may very well open the doors to a full blown privitisation of the water industry within the next decade as it is in parts of England.Youd be stupid to argue that there isnt a deficit or that it doesnt need to be bridged  but the issue that most people have is the way in which the government has set about doing it  putting the burden of taxation on the average working person who had no hand whatsoever in the crisis of  or the subsequent revenue issues it caused.This tax disproportionately affects people with lower incomes and larger families. You outlined the problem correctly but setting up a semistate body and introducing water meters is a retarded answer to this problem.

Its a way of influencing and controlling mass amounts of people and in my opinion is taken far too literally. I believe the bible is a book of stories on how to be a good person and live a good life it is more like Aesops fables. What I will say is that I was raised catholic just by proxy not even strictly but thats the situation I was dealt. I find it useful in situations like funerals and such occasions that we need an outlet to release our emotions through a tradition. For deaths and life is a mystery we cannot explain yet. I do find that I will sometimes say a prayer before I sleep if I am worried or fretting about something in general during the day and that little ritual to me mentally deals with that worry files it away and I can move on. There is good things we can take from religion but spirituality morality and consciousness should in my opinion be separated from it completely as religion is more closely related to a club organisation cult or political party than a mindfulness and morel practise. I find it incredibly hard when I ever attend mass to observe that  for some rare reason there in front of me are priests and congregation that are well educated and intelligent people that I feel just cannot see the proof in front of their eyes! Theses are the same peers that in a court of law would judge your outcome if on a jury where they would be told that they would have to make a decision without reasonable doubt.

The fact hes also quite a nice person on a personal level probably only adds to their defensiveness. Hes viewed as a grandfather figure while Mary Lou is seen as the real leaderThere is also a view among members that we are constantly under attack by the media so they simply will not show any chinks in their armour because they know it will be exploited.

Deeply involved in the preparation of the coup the Chicago boys as they are known in Chile convinced the generals that they were prepared to supplement the brutality which the military possessed with the intellectual assets it lacked. The US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has disclosed that CIA collaborators helped plan the economic measures that Chiles junta enacted immediately after seizing power A Draconian Cure for Chiles Economic Ills Business Week January . Committee witnesses maintain that some of the Chicago boys received CIA funds for such research efforts as a page economic blueprint that was given to military leaders before the coup. It is therefore understandable that after seizing power they were as The Wall Street Journal November   put it champing to be unleashed on the Chilean economy. Their first approach to the situation was gradual only after a year of relative confusion did they decide to implement without major modification the theoretical model they had been taught at Chicago. The occasion merited a visit to Chile by Mr. Friedman himself who along with his associate Professor Harberger made a series of wellpublicized appearances to promote a shock treatment for the Chilean economy  something that Friedman emphatically described as the only medicine. Absolutely. There is no other. There is no other longterm solution. The quotation is from El Mercurio of Santiago March  . sourceUnder the  to  dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet the people of Chile were subjected to a systematic campaign of torture and state violence an estimated    Chilean citizens were executed or disappeared while another  to   were tortured. SourceThe problem that AnCaps fail to recognise is that there never has and never will be a free market Capitalism relies heavily on the State in fact it is fundamental to its developement. Capitalism needs the state it needs violence to implement its doctrine and it needs the states protection once its implemented. Aiming your sights against the state is misguided it is just a functionary a utility the real problem is Capitalism. The state generally has one though not always great flaw and that is democracy.How has that left Chile today? gt SANTIAGO Chile  Chile has the widest gap between rich and poor among the  countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.gt gt The OECD determines a countrys inequality rate by comparing the disposable income of the richest  percent with that of the poorest  percent of a countrys population.gt gt The international organization says in a Tuesday report that while the South American country has the widest inequality gap of its members it also has made impressive efforts to correct that since the global economic crisis began in .gt gt The OECD includes other emerging economies such as Mexico and Turkey.gt gt Newly inaugurated Chilean President Michelle Bachelet has promised a  billion spending program to overhaul education improve health care and reduce the gap between rich and poor.Chile elected Michelle Bachelet  a Socialist as its President.

Doesnt matter if its regular smoking or not if you read the terms and conditions of a brand new policy it will state within the last  months.You should disclose it since like someone else here mentioned if you die or get seriously ill and it is from something smoking related your surviving spouse or SO may get a reduced claim or none at all and youll have wasted some or all of your money paying for the insurance in the first place. Also there are cotinine tests that can prove whether you smoke or not and an insurer can ask for access to your medical history when youre making a new application.You might have done your policy by this stage so just to be aware if you told them you have the odd one and they put you down as a non smoker you need to change that and probably go to another provider who will do the right thing by you.,ireland,cm83i69,2,t5_2qhb9

Also Ireland wouldnt have necessarily united like Germany Italy Spain  the north and east have always been susceptible to foreign invasion and influence  perhaps Viking raiders could have returned and caused an ethnic split between say Ulster and Leinster or between Leinster and Munster. And do remember that Ireland is particularly parochial  Down and Wexford had their own languages distinct from Irish and English dialects of Pict and Yola until recent times and parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh still speak Ulster Scots admittedly in tiny numbers. Plus the  dialects of Gaeltacht Irish are still very different to each other.

In which case he is totally in the right.  He has one job and that is to sell the asset for the best price possible.

As far as self defense neither of us has a license to carry so all of our stuff is locked up in a  lb safe that is bolted to a concrete floor lest you open the door and it would fall on you and kill you if it werent bolted Its not like we have firearms just laying haphazardly around the house. LOL!Some of those rules sound very familiar from what we know about Germany. It takes forever to get a license to own a firearm you must have a place to hunt take a bunch of classes and are also limited on the amount of ammo you can purchase. My brotherinlaw when he came here couldnt believe we just had ammo in the stores on open shelves. He asked how much can you buy and being the smart ass I am said what is the limit on your Visa card. He was stunned especially since he is a detective there.We wanted to go fishing when we were in Ireland and Scotland but it seemed ridiculously expensive and complicated. I think he had smoked salmon at almost every meal while we were visiting.  He goes for King Salmon in upstate New York  great fishing up there. We smoke it ourselves at home. One of the wonderful places we visited was actually closed but they showed us their smoking process and gave us their recipe.Thanks again! Fascinating information.,ireland,cngb28j,-1,t5_2qhb9
2748813,0,t1_cnghug1,A cage on its own isnt too inviting. The trap is is two entry cage with a push plate in the middle that releases the sprung doors at either end. The first photo shows the trap when its disguised and the door sprung. The cluttered mess surrounding it is used to close off a known path that mink have used. Between the scented trail i leave and the bait in the trap it entices the mink into it the fact they can see the other end reduces their caution and means the trap works from either side.Heres some old pics of a trap being set up in the same location The soil on the bottom of the trap is to disguise the cage and prevent a mink from being spooked as it enters the trap.

They call it defense but the independent reports Ive seen show collective punishment of civilians that amass to war crimes shelling UN schools use of white phosphorus still building illegal settlements etc.. Additionally their peace time policy of blockading Gaza turns it into an open air prison with very high unemployment and no freedom of moment. This has set the stage for radicalism and limits the appeal of moderates to represent Gaza. Priming the region for conflict.Having said that I do respect the crazy complexity and difficulty of the core security question for Israelis. For whatever reason there are people on their boarders that want to kill them. Changing their defense strategy could make their security situation far worst leave them open to attack and at worst could lead to massive blood shed. Unfortunately like a lot of people I have no idea what the path to a solution to this problem looks like. I wish them the best and hope they enjoy our beer whiskey dancing and leprechauns.

Woman were expected to be baby factories and it was not unusual for some infants to die. Things were very different depending on your classpoverty level. Very high unemployment so not enough jobs to go round. The big change which probably made the most difference for the country in the s and s was a focus on education. Even though the country still could not find jobs for all the population the emigrants were at least sent into the world a bit better prepared than knowing their rosary! Poorer families would leave school early and get a job if anything was available for very low wages or leave the country if they couldnt find anything. Typically the youngest girl would be expected to stay at home to look after the parents and elder children would be expected to send some money.Richer families kids would stay in school longer and might server an apprenticeship or find a clerical job if they were lucky.

All of the money goes to Irish Water therefore it wont go into a general pot and be used for something else. Protest numbers are definitely down. A friend of mine did some maths and calculated about  people at Saturdays protest. I think this is both because of issues being addressed and the rather militant nature of many protesters. They are hijacking council meetings Who have no say in water harassing politicians misrepresenting residents and just being a plain nuisance.

We know about the health risks of nicotine from studies in Sweden into the use of Snus a smokeless tobacco. Nicotine is not what kills you when you smoke tobacco. Ecigarettes are probably about as safe as drinking coffee. All they contain is water vapour nicotine and propylene glycol which is used to help vaporise the liquid nicotine.Ecigarettes are making tobacco obsolete. So why ban them?I dont like the idea of being addicted to something. But pretending smokers are suddenly going to give up when they havent done that for decades is stupid. Ecigs stop people breathing in tar and keep them alive and healthy longer. we should be encouraging them,ireland,cqfb81c,9,t5_2qhb9

The Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State estimates it takes . years of full time class room time study  hours a week to become proficiency in Korean not fluent it can take an extra  to  years to become fluent. I was there on holidays hung out with lots of expats and no one was able to speak Korean to a level were you could have a basic conversation.

And theyre working on that right now.Teaching everyone how to be sexually responsible and respectful is an everyone issue...your characterisation of feminism is laughable and unhelpfulgtTheres a right way and a wrong way to run surveys. This isnt even the wrong way it doesnt so much as qualify as a legitimate survey.It wasnt for inclusion in an academically reviewed publication it was for information gathering purposes...they have a broad overview and can work to changing those figures...but again I say...put yer money where yer mouth is find out if the figures are actually wrong instead of just assuming they are.gthelps does not in any way equate to neccessary.If you want people of a completely opposite view you go with everything you can to help state your case...harder to refute whats in front of you gtOh no Im outright saying that feminism is a supremacist movement directed by manhaters no implications involved. Now at this point the usual response is not all feminists are like that to which I would agree. Probably  of those who call themselves feminsits have genuinely swallowed the line that its about equality.And from where I sit right now Im lumping you in with the radical feminists I have little time for as yous both demonise the other side and again I say fail the middle because yous are too busy fighting each other.gtHowever the leadership and thinkers of feminism the ones taught in colleges and the ones whose insane theories are being turned into laws theyre uniformly the objectionable type.In your opinion...gtThe correct response therefore isnt to say not all feminists are like that but to demand loudly that these people be removed from leadership positions and if that doesnt happen to remove yourself. Otherwise your silence lends tacit support making you culpable for what they do the same as in any other movement or group.And when I dont agree with feminist stances I dont support them...but you make it sound like were all brainwashed zombies blindly following feminism unquestioningly...very wrong.,ireland,cqjuwc9,-4,t5_2qhb9

It was not out long enough to come to any harm.There are a lot of sad desperate complicated situations out there. This woman could be a child  not even a teenager. She could be in an abusive relationship. She could be another Ann Lovett. She could have postpartum psychosis. She could not have realised she was pregnant until she gave birth. She could have an abusive hyperreligious family. She could have learning difficulties or mental health issues.In fact all of the above are considerably more likely than her just being pure evil. If she were pure evil wed never have found the baby at all.So why not try exercising a bit of good sense and compassion?

While of course homophobes and bigots probably make up a significant portion of the No side it is an injustice to assume that everyone voting No is homophobic or bigoted. Many are voting no due to their ignorance of homosexual parents and the fear they have that children will be hurt by gay parents not necessarily because they think gay peoplechild abusers. When you see the fear and disinformation that the no side is spewing and then add a population of people with no connection to gay peopl or gay life add in the fear of the other and suddenly what should be an easy win for the yes side becomes difficult.

Its sovereignty and the dignity of its people its natural resources and public assetshaving being handed over to financial and corporate capital big business by the Irish political establishment andmanagement classes. Oh yes thats completely neutral and scientific that is. gtthis is being worsened as NAMA and the government enable international property vulture investmentfunds to buy up swathes of Irish homes and land irrespective of the short and long term social impacts.Yep totally objective. gtAnother concept that has been developed is that these protests represent the potential to complete the unfinishedbusiness of the unfulfilled social and political revolution of Connolly and others outlined in the Proclamation............In this sense then Irish peoplenever truly freed themselves from the system mindset or culture of colonisation even in the South. Riiight. No political agenda there whatsoever. gtThe fact that all the establishment parties including the Labour Party Fianna Fail the Greens and Fine Gael havefacilitated this form of recolonization of Ireland by the the Irish golden circle the wealthy financial elite privatecorporations the European Central Bank highlights the democratic and representative failure to fulfil the ideals and visionof the Republic outlined in the Proclamation. Citizens rights and democracy have been reduced to meaningless soundbitesby these parties.  No sirree. Total objectivity. gtThere is clearly the space and necessity for such a new political force. There is the potential and opportunity for such a newparty to emerge in Ireland given the extent of the current crisis and new politics of protest. This new political force couldprovide the answer to the most outstanding task that the antiestablishment forces face. That is how to win a majority of thepopulation behind an alternative political project that challenges the establishment parties of FFFGLabour and their exmembersin Renua. The danger is that without such a new party we will end up in the first scenario outlined above  thatmany voters will end up voting for another establishment government because the lack of an alternative.You see where this is going yeah?

4230101,0,t1_cs1x4fq,Honestly I dont think this is worth discussing further.  You have made your mind up before anything has actually been done at all.  Before a parking spot has been removed.  Before a new traffic system has been fully revealed.  Before you have even had a chance to actually experience Dublin city centre with a larger pedestrian zone you have written off the future of unknown business despite appearing to not know the location of any changes.Dublin has constantly evolved as a city.  It is forever changing and will continue to do so. gt This plan wont cause a decrease in traffic it will cause an increase in traffic. There will be no increase in traffic.  The number of cars will be the same but the route will be different.  There are clogged streets already in Dublin but you appear to take no notice of that.I dont know what issue you have with Dublin Bus but you have yet to actually outline anything they are doing wrong.  gtThe rationale then is well if driving in the city centre is miserable enough... why not Dublin bus?This is your rationale.  Not the rationale.  Two very different things.gt Theyre minor. more darts at peak times does not sound like fundamental reform. Not enough to counterbalance major disruption of roads in the city centre.You selectively omitted some points in the article.How about Introduction of key public transport hubs for train bus Luas taxi and Dublinbikes at Amiens StreetStore Street Westmoreland StreetDOlier Street and Heuston Station. Increase in the number of DARTs at peak times and opening of the Phoenix Park railway tunnel by the end of  allowing Kildare commuters to travel to Connolly station. Additional buses and more priority at traffic junctions. Introduction of Bus Rapid Transit or highspeed highcapacity buses from the suburbs to the city centre. Bus routes will no longer terminate in the city centre and there will be no dwell times.Can you elaborate further about the major disruption of roads?  Is it possible you are referring to a new traffic system as a major disruption of roads?  Again these are two completely different things and I am almost  sure that the people who come up with a new traffic system will be just as capable and qualified as those who created the current model which you seem to be happy with as you would like to keep it.I have no doubt the plans will face difficulties which will have to be overcome but from the little that has been outlined so far I am very impressed with the potential end result.Making a vague claim without any research that traffic will be increased is not a reason to halt the plans. Nor is a personal dislike of Dublin Bus which seemed to serve a purpose to the  million passengers who used it last year.  What changes would you make to improve our transport systems?  You are very quick to shoot from the hip and knock them but very slow to suggest any sort of improvement.If it is revealed during the public consultation that the plan is proven to be not viable then it should not go ahead or be altered to address concerns.To write the plans off so flippantly is so sadly very characteristic of those people in Ireland who love to have a good whinge and moan at anything and everything.

4245080,0,t1_cs43406,I think a lot of people in Ireland underestimate just how rife sexual abuse is here.  Abortion isnt just for people who forgot to take the pill its for people like myself who have suffered rape and got pregnant as a result of that. I urge you to educate yourself a little and take a look at   It isnt a myth that one in four people in Ireland experience sexual abuse.  Unfortunately if you are female and suffer the consequences of sexual abuse and fall pregnant as a result of that there is no way out but to pay a lot of money to fly to the UK mainland to get an abortion.  If you dont have the funds to have the procedure carried out you may be forced to borrow plunge yourself into debt or worse  attempt to carry out the procedure yourself.  There are abortion pills available over the internet now but it isnt clear whether or not these present a risk to a womans health.  Taking them can also lead to prosecution.If you read the article linked it briefs on the story of Savita Halappanavar who was seventeen weeks pregnant went to the hospital in Galway with severe back pain. Within hours of being admitted doctors told her she was miscarrying. The law in Irelandwhich only allows for abortion if a womans life is in dangerprevented Savita from being able to end her pregnancy and her excruciating pain because there was still a fetal heartbeat present. Savita died in terrible pain over the course of several days begging for a medical procedure that would save her life.There are  different stories every year about why Irish women have to travel to the UK for an abortion.  You might not agree with all of them but the fact of the matter is Irish women deserve to have rights over their own body.,ireland,cs44o8s,23,t5_2qhb9

From the reportgt It is widely recognised that other factors notably childcare costs and travel to work costs may also affect the net reward from employment. Callan et al.  and Savage et al.  examined this issue in some detail using data on the pattern of childcare costs from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions SILC to assess the likely impact of this additional factor on the distribution of replacement rates. They found the while fixed costs of work worsened the financial incentive to take up employment for unemployed individuals the impact was quite small. Childcare costs for example had a very limited effect on replacement rates for two reasonsgt a large majority of unemployed jobseekers did not have children.gt For many of those jobseekers with children childcare costs would not necessarily be incurred for a return to work because the spouse or partner of the unemployed person was already engaged fulltime in caring for the child or children.gtIn the present study therefore we do not seek to include estimates of childcare costs focusing instead on extension of our modelling approach to include new feature such as the Back to Work Family Dividend and the impact of including the value of a Medical Card or GP Visit Card on the balance between resources in and out of work for jobseekers.,ireland,cs8ey25,1,t5_2qhb9

No I would not want to be part of a federal Europe. Speaking from the heart it feels ludicrous. We our ancestors fought for our right to freedom for hundreds of years. We are a small proud independent nation. Why would we give the keys back to someone else  years after we got them back. I would fear we would lose our national identity. Speaking from the head it doesnt really make sense. Because we are one of the smaller countries in the EU we would only have a small voice in a federal Europe. France and Germany would largely control this federation and control what other countries get and want. The UK would certainly leave if this ever became a probability which would leave us exposed as the only Englishspeaking country in a federal Europe.

Good atmosphere.Cities are cities though theyre both safer than the US but if you go around either city acting the bollocks and attracting trouble youll get it. For most theres no problems though.Travel around Cork is definitely easier because its smaller but Dublin has a better array of attractions and services being the capital city.If you want to be able to understand those around you go to Dublin  in all seriousness though the Cork accent is very thick and can be difficult to understand. But Im from Dublin so I dont know how difficult Americans might find out accent too.Rent is faaaar higher in Dublin but Trinity does have its own accommodation so it would be okay if you could get there. If money is an issue youre probably better off in Cork. Bear in mind though that youd likely be travelling up to Dublin for flights to and from Anerica because I dont believe Cork runs many if any US flights.As for the colleges themselves Trinity is a far more impressive and respected name.

Its one of the most corrupt countries in the first world. And no Ireland is nowhere near that unhappy prize though were getting worse.The referendum was greeted as a bombshell because its a lazy and deeply cowardly move. Syriza were elected to lead the Greek people out of crisis. That involves making tough choices. Instead theyre refusing to do so and have scheduled a referendum for after the bailout programme expires. Theyre trying to blackmail the Eurozone into extending their time to repay to hold a referendum. In essence theyre gambling with their nations future. As for this shitgtThe reason is a classic one in power systems in which a minority of elites seek to control the majority of the population the threat of a good example. This means that if Syriza is seen to be winning and provide a clear and working alternative to austerity this is likely to embolden similar forces elsewhere in Europe and could ultimately spell disaster for conservative forces like the Irish government.Who here thinks Greece are winning?

Meanwhile a new legal entity has been created overnight staff from the failed bank now work for this new bank and customer accounts are transferred over.To some extent thats basically what happened  the government took over ownership the original owners and shareholders were all wiped out. gtIt just must be possible to do something like this.There are laws in place to prevent exactly that kind of thing. Otherwise any sensible business would open run up debts and then simply transfer everything to a new business. People do do that but the law comes after them  the main reason it has difficulty is in identifying and tracking down the new business and checking that its really the same as the old one. In your proposed bank change there would be no such difficulty and the people coming after them would be financial companies hedge funds and other people wellequipped with sharp lawyers. All the government would have achieved is legal costs on top of the debts.It might also bear mentioning that the government has never paid bank debts. What they put into the banks was capital  banks are required to hold capital in proportion to their liabilities customer deposits bonds etc. To create new banks that could take the place of AIBBOI would have involved pretty much the same amount of capital and its unlikely those banks would have been accepted into the general banking system.If there genuinely were a cheaper way to keep a functional banking system in place there is no reason for the government not to have taken it.

4541483,0,t1_ct2v7ns,gt So why youre expecting employers to pay more than needed to buy some skills?Because the requirement for those skills has increased. Cost of living has increased and with the inability to keep up employees have suffered while still struggling to maintain the job they have. The result for employers is that you now have strained employees who arent eating enough getting enough sleep are struggling with debt and as a whole arent giving  in work. As well as that small costs start nibbling away from their profits anyway a few euros being nicked now and again damaged goods because of unfocused labour as well as an increase in poor service which helps drive away costumers. Also youre not taking into account the savings that are made by the employer on other things apart from wages. Simplified floor designs have saved AldiLidl in areas such as lighting maintenance and space. Products also save money for employers as theres such a wide array of cheaper quality alternatives to more mainstream items.,ireland,ct32yuf,2,t5_2qhb9

He has also been suspected in a number of attempted child abductions in Dublin along with hanging around primary schools and leering at young girls while masturbating. The child and family have gone through enough without their details also being published in newspapers and then sick pedo apologists hiding behind anonymity of the Internet excusing his behaviour as a legitimate sexual orientation and that somehow its ok to rape children.

Maybe those ghost housing estates we also keep hearing about could be put to use after all? And lets not forget a lot of these migrants are not just leeches with IQ.

They force a pseudo coalition between the official unionist and republican parties when an actual democratic election would see SF stripped of power. In fact this entire action exists to prevent SF from replacing their positions an act which would give more power to a group that doesnt have majority backing. Democracy works off the assumption that the state is more stable when the majority of its citizens back the government. It doesnt work in places like Northern Ireland as it is made up of distinct opposing groups. Trying to follow democracy in such situations merely gives one group the mandate to oppress the other which in turn destabilises the state.,ireland,cuzfz89,1,t5_2qhb9

There is also a huge number of people who are stuck in negative equity who benefit from this although only if they are actually selling admittedly Banks would benefit from this seriously which considering the government hopes to sell them to pay back the majority of what they invested to stop them from going bankrupt is actually a benefit to the taxpayer regardless of how outraged it will make people at the fat cats.You have to bear in mind that for every buyer there is a seller and if there is a winner then there is a loser. Certainly from the perspective of government finance there is a definite benefit in house price rises. As you say though a bubble would not be good  I think people will see the prices paid at the height of the boom as a price cap which they will be foolish to go to.Perhaps we might look at some other areas which have had housing booms for comparison.

The notracist thing is to say okay but kick them put one by one the second the stereotype is met by individual members. Assuming all people will act like stereotypes is the very basis of racism even when the stereotype is unfounded. Having systems in place to act once stereotypes occur and target only those adhering to the stereotype is fine.

I believe in the senior matches that only Hurlers from counties who competed in the Christy ring that year are selected so you wont have Hurlers from the top counties playing. Not sure if thats the same for the Us. These young lads skill levels are great to do so well with the compromised rules.

5549408,0,t1_cwkxr9s,Id say the answer to that is far more complex than Id be able to deal with. On a basic level though one can see that the level of policing is absolutely inadequate in some areas of the city. Having Gardai watching live camera footage of OConnell street is worthless for prevention they need to be out and about and seriously engaging. Having cases take forever to get to court is another problem along with judges hands being tied once they do see them. Justice needs to be swift and measured. Locking people up for minor stuff isnt the answer but the current situation in which they know theres no hope of being locked up is a joke and encourages criminals to act with impunity. People fundamentally should be terrified of the courts. That doesnt mean that the courts should be brutal but they should have the ability to impose harsh sentences where necessary. The other side of it is trying to do something in the communities from which these problems stem. Lots of the lads who end up constantly in trouble left school early. A big way of keeping them out of trouble is keeping them busy. It used to be that in YouthReach they could claim full dole and extra for finishing their schooling. That kind of thing needs to come back along with high expectations of young people in those programs. Too many YouthReach centers are short staffed andor staffed by people who see their role as having devolved to babysitting. Way more investment is needed in such projects to give young people a chance. Another thing which should be looked at is addressing the Junkie element. Criminalisation hasnt worked. Softer drugs should be legalised. Harder ones should be too with the Swiss model for example used for Heroin. Treat addiction as a medical issue like they do and just provide the heroin rather than methadone which doesnt work. In doing this you free up massive Garda resources make community policing easier and strike a death blow to the organised criminal elements that make these problems more intractable.Basically make it so the lads you went to school with who you knew would be criminals have every possible chance to not be. Make it easier for them to be law abiding than not. Then if they fail make sure you have the resources there to keep the public safe and punish while rehabilitating offenders. ,ireland,cwkyeqg,2,t5_2qhb9

It was between the latter and Civil war a possible failed state and the spread of extremism chaos and destruction further into West Africa.  That said the Road Map which the Malian parliament approved following French intervention highlighted two essential missions for the transitional Government the restoration of territorial integrity and the organization of free and fair elections.  The results of these may not be ideal.

5730221,0,t1_cx6az16,Maybe in time we will. Historically women have always had more genderbased problems and if you were fighting for gender equality it was for the rights of women. Now we understand more about the pressure men face as well especially around mental health so perhaps its outdated.On the flip side I guess I use the word feminism because if youre fighting for equal rights for women and if women are equal to men it follows logically that men are equal to women therefore issues like the male suicide rate concerns me. I firmly believe that most feminists think like this too its just the loudest ones that tend to go viral because people disagree with them that get the most attention but most people are sound and if they understand an issue they want to help. So the question is do you abandon what historically has been a fucking awesome idea and movement for women that Ive benefited enormously form simply by being born with a vagina in the late th century because some loud people who also benefited are assholes? Or do you stay and maintain a reasonable voice true to the fundamentals of the awesome idea and discredit those are trying to steer the ship towards crazy island?I dont actually know the answer by the way just trying to provide context as to why I dont necessarily think we have to stop using the word feminism.,ireland,cx7e1gw,1,t5_2qhb9

Partition has perpetuated this problem they still see Norn Iron as separate and above everywhere else in these islands doubly problematic given the state was founded as a protestant state for a protestant people. Basically if youre not white protestant then youre not welcome in loyalist areas.

Ive never heard bullshit be replaced by Bullshite in real life only ever online by NonIrish people attempting to sound IrishWords like ye and So yous are are oral only in my opinion I would say those very often when speaking in real life but never once in writing. It seems to be reserved for people that are trying very hard to show how they are Irish by unnecessarily writing down common Irish vocal ticks. I see this most often in those Sunday posts here How are ye all getting on on this soft aul day twould knock you down with tfierceness of it to be sure Obviously this is a bit of an exaggerated post but cringey titles not that far from it show up weeklyWhat Im trying to show here is that having a bot search for Irish people alone cannot be done by having it search for the usual Irish words. Its a fun idea but the only really words I could suggest would be words that have been used by mainly the Irish online. The two that come to mind areL the emoticon used on bebo to signify laughing. Because of the huge amount of Irish people that were on bebo this is still an emoticon I see used quite often online by Irish people and is quite a clear indicatornbnbnb may just be a local one that I and others use.

Your comparison of the extension to the phone number was irrelevant. His address isnt good enough and a slight mistake of a rarely used postcode would mean the ambulance might not get there.There are two major problems with EirCode in resolving this situation. For one thing the governments disorganisation of the codes the rollout implementation and messaging around the codes mean that most people arent using them. So in an emergency situation most people arent going to know the code. The other problem is that by randomising  of the  digits in an effort to monetise it means that its more likely for people to get the number wrong. Having logic makes it easier to remember. If youre in Dublin you know all the even postcodes are for the southside and you know     are around the city centre and    and  are on the outskirts simple progression. Dublins postcodes could be better organised but they were constantly evolving throughout the th Century which is why theyre imperfect but still show more logic than EirCode.,ireland,cyu7kb7,1,t5_2qhb9

If you click into some of the profiles they are dodgy as hell. Pages can go viral but theres no evidence of that. And all the likes but much much less actual engagement comments and the comments there are are often repeated or gibberish. This is an absolutely classic case of buying likes.gti would expect it to be irrespective of whether it is fake or not.Ill elaborate. The webpage advises people to contact the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland for help with emigrating. This is not what the MRC does. Nobody who knows even a little bit about it would think it did.The page repeatedly suggests people should illegally overstay visas andor claim asylum and live in Direct Provision. Now I can believe somebody who advise that. Ive heard plenty of people advise on overstaying Js  but advise like that is ALWAYS followed up with and you might get permanently banned from the US if they catch you. But this website doesnt mention the risk of being mistreated by unscrupulous employers paying under the table. It doesnt mention how many hijabis get hassle on the street. It doesnt mention the sexual assault and the lack of freedom and the crappy conditions in Direct Provision centres. My point isnt whether these points are reasonable or not btw I know lots of people think Direct Provision is perfectly ok  its just that it doesnt ring true because actual migrant advocates in Ireland never stop going on about that stuff. Any organisation that wanted to help immigrants would be talking about it.But instead we get stuff like thisgtThe state of Ireland grants immigrants who arrive to it access to these services that normally dont come free to the Irish citizen.I mean that is just cringeworthy. That was not written by some wierdo imam who as the Irish Times article points out apparently cannot actually speak Arabic. That was written by some dope whos spent too much time in the Journal comments section. Free prams Joe! And a free car as well.I dont see a single reason to maintain an open mind.

6233907,0,t1_cyy6jwk,Actually this issue has nothing to do with full names.Your problem is that if you dont see a first and last name you dont trust them. You think the fact that they dont tell you their full name means that theyre in some fashion lying andor making it possible to pull one over on you. That way they can tell you whatever they want without consequence.You have this ridiculous belief that a full name equates to honesty.It is absolutely true that you dont need a surname to stalk someone. A really determined person could follow the script you laid down. A crazy mentally disturbed person I mean.But were not talking about that. Were talking about the people who have less up front courage and more passive aggressive tendencies. Who will hang out on facebook looking for them. Or will call and hangup from a blocked number. Send anonymous threatening emails. ETC. And a surname is enough for that. And mitigating risk from a liability point of view is something laid down by policy makers at upper levels whether you buy it or not.In any case it doesnt matter their reasons. Incomplete names arent the problem. Your irrational beliefs and judgments are the problem.Earlier you missed the entire point I was makingthe fact that you arent dealing with a person youre dealing with a company. They could all walk around with no name tags  no names at all and it wouldnt matter in terms of representing the company and its policy they are interchangeable. If one of them makes a mistake then any other of them should be able to fix said mistake via looking at your customer or transaction history.That should be enough for you if you came in with a healthy expectation that the company was going to behave honestly and straightforwardly with you. But you dont really believe that. You have an inherent mistrust it seems and you are projecting it onto some display of a full name in what is a fetishising kind of way.Full names ! honesty. Let that sink in. Plenty of places with their full names will lie to your face. Plenty of others with no nametags will do all in their power to treat you well as a customer.You need to decide whether or not you trust a company and stop using the ones you dont.

The lifestyle that we have is causing a lot of damage and consuming a lot of resources as we wreck ecosystems for agricultural land or to expand urban environments along with spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

6412542,0,t1_cziioxh,gtHe is gay.I know.gt He doesnt agree that certain things like gay marriage for some reason The reason being at best that hes pandering to bigoted conservatives amp at worst the he himself is a bigot.gt but he has the right to his belief even if its a strange one. Some might say he has a gay right to his beliefs.What does this have to do with anything? Who is saying he doesnt?gtYeah his views on trans people are pretty backwards at times. He does at least concede that transgenderism is real due to the evidence of evidence of there being a difference between male and female brains.Very generous of him.gtPeople keep claiming he is unethical but the majority of everything he posts has to pass through their legal department before it goes up including his articles exposing a pedophile which took a couple weeks of legal fact checking. Some of his stuff is opnion written as if its news and that seems to rub people the wrong way. That being said I dont read everything he writes so maybe Ive missed some things that are shady. Some examples would be nice.His willingness to associate with Breitbart the number  standard in unethical journalism is certainly pretty suspicious. One could argue that his plan is to turn the place around. Doesnt seem like it though. Seems like hes just happy to align with a publication that parrots his ignorant beliefs.Anyway he made unverified claims about Anita Sarkeesian reporting her harrassment which turned out to be false. He reported it as news.But most importantly giving proper acknowledgement amp recompense to journalists who work for a media company is a cornerstone of ethical journalism. Credit where credit is due. Given the entire debacle with The Kernel amp Yiannapoulos being sued for refusing to pay a contributor a case which the contributor won amp the publication of an email in which Yiannapoulos threatened to publish embarrassing pictures of another contributor as blackmail for bringing disrepute on his publication I can safely say that there are serious question marks over Yiannapouloss adherence to ethical standards.,ireland,czijhud,7,t5_2qhb9

There is an argument for same with hard drugs too to make it a public health issue rather than a legal one but that would be politically unpalatable for most parties today as youd have moral panic by the masses on principle because drugs are bad over the more realistic right some drugs are really bad but what can we do about it even though we dont agree ye should be taking them?. A lot more reasonable the latter.I could see an incremental system being put in place but only after the public sees the pros and cons in action from soft drug decriminalisation like you said keeps money in gangs hands for instance to a more practical one but there would be hard lessons learned in the meantime.

6563039,0,t1_czy4wwt,gt  Eh I would argue that the major political parties would be more likely to select a male candidate if only to support a political dynasty on name recognition.If the parties themselves are composed of sexists then theres nothing at all wrong with the system itself. You just have a party of sexists.We neither need to use gender quotas nor to look at the demography of the Dail to tell us that theres a problem in the Dail and how to fix it. Stance toward the th Amendment is a pretty handy guide. Want to advance the cause of womens rights and to increase equality? Dont vote for any party or candidate whose policy platform supports the th. And if one of those gets elected dont expect them to support equality.gt but I wouldnt accept for one second that its as easy to get elected if youre a woman as a man.Ask the woman whos running in place of Brian Mohan whether its easier or not to be elected as a woman. Its certainly easier for her to get elected than himIm not even saying that the Civil War parties arent good ol boys clubs. Im simply saying the problem is fixed at source. Just get rid of them or keep refusing to vote for them until they replace their membership with people who arent sexists.gt that women dont necessarily need to have  representation in the Dail to have their views representedMy point is that I dont care what representation they have in terms of demographics. I only care that they have the exact same opportunity to compete with men and to stand for election as any other candidate. I care about means not ends.In that sense I would immediately repeal sex quotas because they are reverse discrimination.gt but your point about the GuardsArmy is entirely irrelevant.I was making the point that actual equality might not produce actual demographic representation whilst still being entirely equal.gt Im familiar with the issue and with yer wan in New York suing over not getting into the fire brigade despite her not meeting the physical requirements but its just not relevant in a political debateThe US Army has different physical fitness standards for men than for women.,ireland,czy68l0,1,t5_2qhb9

6565291,1,t1_czyc1n4,gtYou conflate the views of some people in politics and society with an institutional barrier.No you conflate the absence of laws that openly discriminate against female participation in politics with the absence of institutional sexism. Institutional andor structural discrimination exists in many different forms. There was no laws discriminating explicitly against black people in the US in the s and s yet no one would deny that they were subject to institutional racism in areas like housing and policing. Similarly just because there are no formal rules any more barring women from politics does not mean that they do not face institutional sexism. For instance on pg of todays Indo theres a piece on the Cork SouthWest constituency and in the opening line FF candidate Margaret Murphy OMahony is described as mother of two Margaret Murphy OMahony. A male politician would never be described as a father of two. You might say this is individual sexism on the part of the journalist but I would argue it is as a result of institutionalised ideas about a womans role as a caregiver. gtBut those views arent institutional barriers. And more importantly Irish society isnt static. Views take time to change and its often a generational type event. These views do not exist in a vacuum and its not that we have a section of the population who are consciously sexist that is the problem. If that was the case wed have a much easier job But its because of historically institutional sexism that it is perceived among both men and women consciously or subconciously that politics is a male domain. Codified laws barring women from public office have existed in the past and just because they no longer exist does not mean the attitude or the systematic sexism that created them does not exist. As I mentioned already until  women who worked in the Civil service had to retire once they married. This was a legal manifestation of the view that a womans place is in the home and just because the law was abolished does not mean the attitude that created it is abolished. If we want to get pedantic the constitution STILL says that a womans place is in the home so would that not meet your very narrow definition of institutional sexism? Yes we have changed hugely in terms of our views and attitudes in the last  years but we still live in a patriarchal society that views men as dominant and women as subservient . Its one that has been crafted over centuries and is not easy to simply wipe away. gtThe problem I have with your position is that you want to use law to correct a problem that is not created institutionally. And in the process you are perfectly happy to commit the same sin you are trying to fix to discriminate against a person based upon nothing but their sex.This is just such a fallacy. Your understanding of institutional sexism leaves a lot to be desired. Do you really believe that the ultralow participation of women in politics is down to members of society just naturally holding sexist views? You seem to think that sexism against women exists in a vacuum and is not the result of years of systematic sexism. gtBut thats not how things work because thats not the real problem. The real problem is your common man and woman who vote for these people who support the th Amendment and who in other cases still think women should be mothers at home with children. Theyre the problem the politicians merely reflect the views of the people who elected them.Yeah I know they largely think consciously or subconciously that. But Im looking at why they think that. And my argument is that it is largely down to institutional sexism.gtJust understand that those  of women put into the Dail so the parties get funding now have their own merit underlined and there are now questions as to whether they ought to be there at all. Your quotas got them into office but not on merit. I personally wouldnt think of that as an achievement for womens rights.Ah yes the great merit argument. That before these gender quotas politics was a meritocracy where the brightest and best who all just happened to be men rose to the top. What about candidates who have a father or a relation already in politics? Or candidates who are picked because they are in the right part of the constituency for votes? Or candidates who are picked because of their unyielding loyalty to senior figures rather than any personal achievements? ,ireland,czyelyl,0,t5_2qhb9

Its a form of thought crimewhere men are presumed to be guilty of something before they ever have an opportunity to be or not be guilty. I attack this idea specifically but that often means drilling down through layers of justification to get to what is at the bottom.

6777987,0,t1_d0kkcfm,Okay since im not new to Ireland anymore ill lay out my view on Dublin. There is garbage everywhere. This isnt just litterbugs this is infrastructure. Everybody has to toss their garbage out on the street with a fucking sticker on it? Seriously? Garbage bags arent that robust and animalsknackershomeless etc will get into them. Whatever happened to industrial bins? Every other EU country has them. This is what happens when this shit is privatized. Its not all litterbugs although they do exist of course. And thats not even mentioning the people who just toss their shit on the street without purchasing a sticker. That stuff never gets collected and ends up strewn all over the place.But when Dublin looks like a bin people are going to treat it as one. There are many things the government could do to clean up the city but instead they rely on volunteers to clean up after everybody. This is wrong. And i generally get the impression from Irish people that if things are shit why bother fixing them? Thats just how it is kinda attitude. That was actually my first impression on moving here and its just plain wrong. This citycountry has major infrastructure problems which could easily be fixed but when they arent even recognized as issues. That is bad.I really wonder where my  tax goes sometimes... Seemingly supporting lazy knackers including city center housing for knackers and their knacker kids. Because its certainly not going towards healthcareinfrastructure or anything that would benefit me. Gotta pay for that stuff separately of course.,ireland,d0kkh5p,8,t5_2qhb9

Even TG caters to people who dont much feel like knowing Irish by having subtitles. If anyone hates Irish it probably stems from this  that they had to endure a subject they increasingly saw little point to. There are some people who undoubtedly enjoy the cultural enrichment of learning Irish but that isnt a good enough reason to make it compulsory. If it is then why arent students also expected to learn how to learn traditional Irish music as well? Or have Gaelic games be the only games to play in P.E. Great mistake to make the education system the custodian of the Irish language because as a whole the state has sucked the life right out of it and provided no compelling reason to children as to why they should learn it. At least with German and French you know that by learning it youll be able to converse with many people who cant necessarily speak English but being able to speak English is an additional ability of just about every fluent Irish speaker on this island. ,ireland,d0mfjs9,2,t5_2qhb9

6844623,0,t3_497e1h,I havent watched the video yet but when I was studying in the USA I met a Jewish girl who asked me if its true that Irish people dont like Jews. Apparently her rabbi had said something to that effect. I think she was one of the first Jews Ive ever met and so I actually had no prior opinion on Jews not that I would ever have one anyway because I dont judge individuals on ridiculously broad strokes. The Irish people are definitely more sympathetic to the Palestinians in the Middle East and I would say that there is a small level of hatred towards Israelis who support what is going on in the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinians but its totally divorced from any sentiment toward Jews. Im pleasantly surprised after watching the video lots of positive comments about us.

He blames the state and the media for brainwashing people. Thats the mentality of the traveller community. They are victims the state settled people the media are the enemy the faults of their community are caused by external forces.Which is absolute nonsense. The state and the media is guided by society and public opinion which is based on the lives and experiences of the people who live in that society. And the overall experience of travellers has been of an aggressive untrustworthy anti social people with little regard or respect for the settled community. For us to move forward they have to accept and respect the laws and the rights of people in this country and this society. They have to accept that there are faults in their community that must be addressed from within that community and they cant just do what they want.We cant move forward with Were not the problem we want to do our own thing irrespective of your laws you lot have to accommodate us and pay for everything.Edit That said there is obviously issues to do with discrimination that need to be addressed. I dont for a second think its acceptable for people to abuse travellers for being travellers and I know by and large the vitriol posted online about them is despicable. But as far as moving forward as two different groups of people in one society there has to be an understanding in the traveller community that the settled community is not the enemy trying to destroy them or assimilate them. The settled communities problem is the high crime rate and anti social behaviour. If thats addressed and that improves the experiences on both sides will improve. ,ireland,d165w7q,13,t5_2qhb9

6985737,0,t1_d17ypy7,Tiny houses can be anything between  sq ft and  sq ft. My one is going to be about  sq ft. Some are built on trailer beds and others are built on foundation. Remember Tiny is used from an American perspective. The average American house is  sq ft. Many Tiny Houses are larger than any flat or apartment Ive lived in in Ireland or the UK.Not claiming it fixes all housing problems. But for many people it is a great solution. This is not my website but here is domestic Irish company doing them.They typically range from k to k. There is wide spread because some people want to build themselves and others want the best in luxury. With small sq ft you can spend on high quality materials that would bankrupt you in normal build. It also is good for creative types because clever planning can make your house cost a year or three of your rent bill.No matter your income you can be mortgage free if you choose this path.,ireland,d1869d6,2,t5_2qhb9

The type of info that you are giving to Facebook is sold to big data companies who will trend the data and sell the trend info on to advertising companies or big companies that want to try and figure out what the next big product the public want so that the can make it and sell it to us. There are other buyers but those are the main ones. Also all of the information that you send to Facebook is by a secure method and on secure servers and most likely encrypted not plaintext on a form in someones house not sure if that is how it is stored Ive no dog in this race In fact Netflix did just this themselves by trending what most people were watching types of shows actors etc. They used this information to make house of cards. Now sure if you dont have any privacy measures in place on your Facebook account like making sure only people who you have accepted as friends can see your account or statuses then people could probably look at your data and figure out where you are at any given time and know that your house is empty or if you upload a lot of photos of your belongings or the inside of your house then they will have an idea if it is worth robbing you but these are all easily avoidable.

7136778,0,t3_4dbea2,From the articlegtThe episodes were not well received by viewers or the media. The BBC and the programme makers were heavily criticised for the stereotypical way they portrayed Irish people. Viewers were angered by scenes that they felt portrayed Irish as resentful towards English drunk dirty poor and rude  one scene showed a drunk man pouring beer over Pauline Fowler later revealed to be her brotherinlaw and then demanding payment for the drink. Others were angered by the scriptwriters decision to include various farm animals in a street scene on the outskirts of Dublin with one viewer commenting to the Daily Mirror It was nothing like life in the real Ireland of today. When did you last see a donkey walking along our streets? The EastEnders production team havent got a clue about modern Irish society they are living in the Dark Ages.gtThe angry reaction stretched from official channels such as the Irish Embassy to holiday chiefs who feared that the episodes would have a negative effect on tourist trade. The Irish Embassy in London said EastEnders has caused a great deal of upset and annoyance in the country Ireland and with Irish people in Britain. Furthermore they suggested that the episodes presented a prejudiced and stereotyped view of Ireland that was utterly unrecognisable. Ted Barrington Irelands ambassador to the UK described the portrayal of Ireland as an unrepresentative caricature stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness backwardness and isolation.I for one am outraged that a TV show would stereotype the Irish in such a way.

I couldnt believe that Transdev came back with an  increase then I nearly crashed the car when I heard that it was overwhelmingly rejected.In this scenario the Luas drivers are on another planet. If they were after  increase and were meeting resistance then Id be saying fair enough but I think Transdev are fed up with it now. An allout strike is going to hurt the drivers a hell of a lot more than a state subsidised corporation. Day after day of no pay will hopefully get the drivers to see a bit of sense. Their issue is now that they rejected  and depending on how long the strike continues they could end up settling for the same or less and if they do settle for the same or less it will be seen as a big failure for the union more than a victory.Im sure bus drivers are watching on with bated breath whatever about the disruption caused by Luas the buses striking can really kick the city in the knackers.TLDRDont be greedy ya jerks.,ireland,d1zj1oi,77,t5_2qhb9

7233693,1,t1_d205rd7,Thats what it started out as it was essentially some guys attempt to get revenge on a cheating ex but what it subsequently ballooned into was a culture war between cultural authoritarians and cultural libertarians.Essentially What KiA and other such groups object to is the trend on the left to call something problematic and then to further elaborate that this means it shouldnt be published. Take that comedy in England about the Irish famine  there were two types of hostile reaction to it. The first was This is revolting stuff the second was This is revolting and I want it banned by the broadcasting authority or withdrawn by the TV station.KiA and others object to the rise of the latter group. When it comes to feminism theyre objecting to Anita Sarkeesian not because she says here are the things I dont like in games but because she says here are the things I dont like in games lets boycott petition and demand that they be changed.It flies in the face of the s internet culture many old school internet users grew up in wherein the dominant philosophy is if you dont like something get over yourself you dont get to decide what others get to write. Thats why its met with such disdain from certain groups. But its not misogyny  it just so happens that radical feminists are one group which is attempting to apply rules to the internet. If the church still had power and if the church was to ban The Life of Brian the same KiA types would be objecting. They are also broadly the same people who took part in Draw Muhammad Day on Facebook in response to Comedy Central being threatened by Jihadists over a South Park episode.They dont have any loyalty to any particular side beyond there should be no rules about what opinions people can express and there is no right to an internet where nothing offends you. To that end they will fight any person or entity which says I dont like this and I want mods someone in charge to stop it.,ireland,d20f2ag,-4,t5_2qhb9

And the The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said While safety concerns about HPV vaccines have been raised these have systematically been investigated to date the GACVS has not found any safety issue that would alter any of the current recommendations for the use of the vaccine. Then when it comes to the antivaccine argument we are left with Frequently studies are used to try to prove the illeffects of Gardasil.

This is something I have heard regularly although it may not actually be true a quick google shows me. Additionally they are also supposed to be better at multitasking  pretty important as a fighter pilot trying to handle multiple bandits and a beeping RWR and incoming IR missiles and drop a bomb on a car and communicate over the radio and keep an eye out for other planes and plan your egress and... This one seems to be bettersupported.The basic point is even leaving aside individual differences from the norm most things require a bunch of different skills and theres no reason why they should line up with one genders natural aptitudes where those natural aptitudes even actually exist.

He was an excellent face of the Republic at this time  the British were very surprised at him as he  wasnt the typical rowdy Irishman that they thought us all to be.Being a good politician in the traditional sense doesnt make you a great leader or good for IrelandgtThe civil war was a major fault of his character in my opinion.Almost unforgivable in my opiniongtBut upon the formation of Fianna Fil and his first government in  his government began a social housing programme he gave amnesty to many IRAmen who had been interned in the Cumann na Gaedhael yearsFirst part fair enough he built houses what a great man. Secondly is that a good thing? He released them because they were his pals and fought on his side in the civil war. He had to destroy the IRA later so was this really a good thing?gtHis partys entry into the Dil in  effectively took the gun out of Irish politics he embraced constitutionalism to achieve his goals.Eventually.gtUnder his government he attempted to grow Irish industry which had mixed results protectionism is largely seen as a failure today but he did succeed in building the countrys infrastructure and encouraging the growth of industry.The economy was a complete failure under his tenure. He wanted self sufficiency for patriotic reasons not practical ones.gtAs I said de Valera was a brilliant politician he began to strip away at the Treaty which culminated in his  Constitution.Collins idea. gtOf course the constitution did have its faults but for the time it was actually quite progressive and he refused to officially make Catholicism the states religion to the annoyance of the Church.Was that not as much due to the fact he had Jewish friends? Not sure on this one correct me if Im wronggtHe managed to skillfully return the Treaty Ports in the Anglo Irish Agreement of  this allowed us to remain neutral in the Second World War. This was a huge achievement of his.Accidentally achieved it though. He didnt know there would be a war just around the corner. Not to mention the economic war that proceeded it gtHe chaired the League of Nations and began to show Ireland to the rest of the world as a proper country he showed his talents as a statesman and helped to develop relationships with other countries.Ireland was massively isolated after its neutrality in WW. And anyone could have established relations with other countriesgtHe of course had his faults his close alignment with the Catholic Church and his part in the beginning of the Civil War are his biggest failures in my opinion but he wasnt all bad.Wasnt all bad. But mostly bad and a terrible man for Ireland.,ireland,d2el7kd,4,t5_2qhb9

The land movement is significant because it began to dismantle the plantations which were the very means of trying to secure rule. Irelands freedom was won in many ways.  played a crucial role in turning the mass of the people away from a Home Rule solution but there had been huge steps forward before that. The FeniansIRB are usually said to have been founded mid nineteenth century. The  rising was of little significance in undermining British rule except in that it kept physical force nationalism alive and galvanized constitutional and agrarian movements further. ,ireland,d2fcwg0,11,t5_2qhb9

Like say Ive learned the differnt arts seperately but never had them strung together as mixed martial arts. He is a genuine hero of mine. Coincidentally I was home this weekend and at our local having a drink with my family and there and BT sports was on in the background no idea what was on since it was muted but they had a piece on SBG focusing on Paddy and Aisling. I remember being a bit surprised it was on and pointing out my coach and talking nonsense for a bit.The last few months I was watching him spar and train in preparation for this fight. He was trying to keep in top shape in case anyone pulled out in the division. It frustrated him that the division was so small that even  matchups takes a third of the division out.Ill miss watching him fight but looking forward to seeing him tomorrow if they are back from Iceland.Im really gutted to not see him compete again Paddy is one of the best coaches Ive ever had.,ireland,d2grxel,5,t5_2qhb9

No. It means if your rent is more than  a week you will receive NOTHING. Yes thats right if the rent is  or under they will pay some of your rent but a penny over and they tell you to fuck off. Landlords know this and deliberately set the rent just above the local limit to keep the riff raff out. The application process for rent allowance is fucking atrocious.

7663627,0,t1_d3d8i93,gt Alright I get your point but I was only suggesting that its a slippery slope to justify spending in such a manner. Im not saying this increase would cost millions but the use of fear is used to increase government spending on military. My main point is the justification of the spend which is propelled by fear. Someone else commented that the terrorist attacks in Europe are sound enough justification.gt gt gt gt The way you approached this discussion was an attempt to belittle my comment which was just an honest question I was asking.Im belittling the idea that outfitting  new lads with gear and small arms will lead to us being some sort of warmongering police state.Im belittleing the idea that a small neutral nation with an illustrious peacekeeping career is up to something sinister by expanding its premiere unit of a few dozen lads by a few dozen more.Im belittling the implication that the Rangers will be used solely for sinister ends using some sort of fake terror plot to oppress the people. The Rangers do an awful lot more than antiterror duties you should read up on them they are a multidimensional unit.Im belittling the idea that by outfitting a few dozen lads were suddenly complicit in some sort of grand militaryindustrial plot to keep the people down.I asked for you to explain to me how such a relatively small expenditure would stimulate the economy as you implied it would and I get this nonsensegtGovernment spending is government spending. It does not matter if its spent on a hospital bed or a gun or wages for Rangers? It all promotes economic stimulus.Recessions over lads well spend our way out of it!gtI think military spending increases based on fear mongering will often always get approved because people are scared whereas increases in social welfare spending would be questioned more. Like I said elsewhere there is a homegrown terrorist issue still outstanding on this island. There are terrorist attacks in Europe at the moment and we have very very few armed police should they ever be needed. Ive also pointed out the Rangers are used for so much more than antiterror so they wouldnt be tramping around with their jackboots on the peoples throats as you seem to think.By the nature of social welfare spending you cant do it in small amounts. Do it in small amounts and it makes no difference. Do it in large amounts that are needed and youll have opposition and people questioning it. This is because of the vast amounts involved for your homework compare the amounts Ireland spends on the armed forces and on social welfare  youre in for a shock and the fact that social welfare spending is often very much an issue divided on class lines. Yet you seem blind to the very obvious and the very nuanced issues around social welfare spending.,ireland,d3db74a,0,t5_2qhb9

I agree with some of what McWilliams is saying here and its great to see these ideas migrating from the blogosphere to mainstream media but I dont agree it will be easy or straightforward. His article is kind of an ELI for oul wans who still think weed and heroine are the same thing so it being a bit simplistic is OK for now.Opposing legalisationdecriminalisation will create political opportunities for Lucinda Creighton types and other bullshitters out there. Entrenched drug gangs are likely going to sabotage weed shops or legal growing operations. Legalising hard drugs like heroin and coke isnt some silver bullet. It needs to be handled delicately to provide a constructive alternative to addiction. People need to transition into education jobs and decent housing in order to stay drug free so a lot of state agencies have to get their acts together in tandem with any progressive drug policy.

For example  DROP TABLE reddit commit without sanitisation could dump your data.One simplistic way of remedying this is to restrict the input only to specific characters  just alphanumeric plain letters numbers spaces. That way nobody can inject anything weird to mess with your backend. Of course we do have far better ways of handling these things nowadays anyway.,ireland,d3q81qt,0,t5_2qhb9

8092129,0,t1_d4pmcvj,Being a part of the European Union has been nothing short of fantastic for Ireland. If not for the EU it would still take  hours to drive to Galway. There is a sense of complacency these days a generation of people who think its always been like this. Well I grew up in the s I can remember Ireland being a fairly depressing place has to be said that nobody was laden with debt so in a sense it was more carefree but still pretty depressing.Ireland is a spec on the map were proper Islanders in that we dont see ourselves as Islanders. We are greater then the sum of our parts but even at that were still very very small on the grand scheme of things. Also dont forget we have little or no airforce or navy and our army although extremely well trained is small enough too. Lets say we leave the EU and make our own way then one day Russia starts picking on us..wot do?Point is the EU is as much out having a nice big singular powerful entity economically as it is in other forms e.g. military although lets hope we never ever see the day this power is called upon. At the end of the we could leave and trade away with the USA and China among others but at any moment the worlds economy can go tittys up however while in the EU the free trade agreements will keep us insulated to a degree and we can keep the lights on.Im far from knowledgeable on the matter as a whole but I can clearly see the seriously huge benefits a small nation like ours enjoys. Please remember that the UK has a population of million for now so they can survive and thrive on their own. Ireland can survive but thrive outside the EU I dont think so.,ireland,d4pmn3a,23,t5_2qhb9

8106236,0,t1_d4r2bt4,There are decent travellers but the traveller culture is a backwards culture. Women who get pregnant out of wedlock get beaten to a bloody pulp to set an example for the younger women which evidently doesnt work if it keeps happening. When travellers move to areas there is generally an increase in theft and violence. The decent travellers may not be involved but they sure as shit arent stopping the pricks.Prejudice is defined asgt preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.From the examples set above there is reason to believe that if a landlord kicks out a traveller for being violent hes telling the truth. That isnt prejudice against travellers thats an informed decision. Prejudice is when a traveller shows they were not acting out and you refuse to believe it. Until the travelling community keeps their own in check it is entirely reasonable to believe that if they are kicked out of an area for being violent then they likely were being violent.

8305760,0,t1_d5fncjz,The only real error that might be present is what I gather you think a pension state or otherwise is  its not a benefit from nowhere for these teachers since theyll have been paying taxes for it for their working lives its something they bought and paid for that is now performing its function.A pension is no different to anything else that you buy. Once you own it however much it pays out is just what its supposed to  in this case they probably get more than just the state pension because their contributions will have amounted to more than what the state pension would pay out.Its been a while since Ive actually done a pension calculation so Id be slow to start going into that element of it. Basically every paycheque you contribute a certain amount to a pension fund. That is then grouped with other peoples contributions and invested with certain rules governing how those investments work. The long you have it invested the greater your return is likely to be. When you finally decide to cash out i.e. stop contributing and start getting payments they come from the total lump sum of what you have invested and the returns on that investment. Its your own money youre getting back. The reason its invested in this way is that there are typically tax benefits associated with it  in the case of the state pension its still the case that its those teachers money that theyre being paid each week. The only people that isnt true for would be people whose contributions are less than their payments but this would be very atypical for teachers.,ireland,d5frz63,2,t5_2qhb9

8385999,0,t1_d5ov0q9,I remember living in a gentrifiedscuzzy part of a large metro city. Out one night with my gf walking home from a restaurant and ahead of us we see this lady following a plain looking white guy yelling about how she needed money for a taxi to get to an interview. Keep in mind it is about pm. The guy is quietly polite and attempting to walk away from her as fast as she can she is trailing behind him asking more and louder. Then she starts yelling loudly something along the lines of I hope you have a daughter one day and have to get back to her and no one helps you!He is out of range and she turns to us both of us walking by like a zombie sensing fresh brains but my gf gives her a I dont thinks so kind of look. The lady asked for any change we said we had no cash and keep going true cards only she then stumbled back to her original street corner to begin the whole play. Now this lady looked a little fucked up on some kind of heavy drugs but the thing I couldnt get over was the inconsistency to her narrative and the aggressive approach of her pleas. Initially it was about going to a job interview at pm high as a kite no less then it was about getting home to her daughter. I assumed the interview is the daytime grift and the home to daughter is the evening version. I felt bad for her but the flaws in her story were jarring to say the least so I couldnt reward that.

8423867,0,t1_d5teq9u,gt Yknow in any normal country the logical and cheaper solution would be to encourage decentralisation  while    investing  more in infrastructure around the regional cities. Not to import another entire  country thats got exactly the same problem and a humongous deficit to go with it.In any normal country they arent suffering the affects of an artificial partition that was created in the s. Reintegrating the partitioned segment of the country is not analogous to one country absorbing a totally foreign entity  the north and Republic already share a great deal of infrastructure culture and even citizens. The issue of a Dublincentric economy is a direct result of partitioning off the countrys second biggest city so reunification deals directly with the problem in the most efficient way. Trying to encourage growth in Cork or Limerick is treating the symptom but may have worked if wed began doing it  years ago. Attempting such a herculean task now may be cheaper in the short term but most likely a great deal more economically taxing the long term as it would take generations to eventually turn back the tide.gt So the facts dont matter folks you should all just go with how you feel?Thats probably how it will be sold to the public actually yeah. Im not saying its right but its certainly how the campaign will be fought by the main political parties in the Republic.gt Ive been told repeatedly by various people that they feel hurt angry offended even betrayed! by that answer and you think Im the one that descended into being emotional? Well Im not privy to any arguments youve had with other people but youre certainly the emotional one in this debate.gt Somebody will start pointing out these inconvenient little facts sooner or later.Im sure therell be a few independents that take your stance but theyll likely have the weight of all the major political parties against them. FF FG Labour  none of them will risk handing their constituents to SF by fighting reunification.gt Youve said that theres a benefit to having a welldeveloped second city to which I completely agreed. What you havent done is explained how adopting an entire country to fill that gap isnt total overkill when there are cheaper and easier solutions available. Solutions that will benefit us the people actually paying for them not a bunch of blowins.As Ive said trying to fund growth in Cork or Limerick would only be cheaper in the short term but by no means easier. Reunification is the quicker more expensive option in the short term but least economically taxing in the long term as it would head off the housing crisis before it gets considerably worse. With a new capital city that Belfast can actually compete with the north is likely to start paying for itself within  years and become a net benefit to the country  something which is good for all people on the island.As for your blowins comment I think youre being emotional again. With Reunification the north would not just become part of the Republic the two would form one new country. In that respect I suppose wed all be blowins.,ireland,d5uiwue,1,t5_2qhb9

Because all the seeding smaller teams together does is allow one or two of them to qualify only to be guaranteed to be eliminated by having any further progress depend on six matches instead of one or two. Wheres the fun in knowing that every year youll be trotted out to some shitty Baltic state and if you manage a victory youll get a fit but boring Scandinavian team? Meanwhile any shock result in the Champions League proper is quickly papered over by another  games in which the proper TV market expectations can be restored.Knockout competition inherently allows for more chance of both exciting draws for teams that otherwise will get them once in a decade and actual shock results. As it stands a shock result doesnt matter. This can be seen clearly where even the English and Italian teams are starting to fall behind the Spanish and Germans. Thirteen nations have had teams go all the way through to the final but these days you can pretty much guess which two itll be every year. How is that exciting?

It essentially allows them to be able to put no fat on the label without losing the lard taste.  Anyway  they apparently had to test it on pigs because they have the closest digestive system to humans.  They gave these pigs x dose for months.  As you can imagine it was like an oil slick from all the greasy shit and man o man did that shit smell.  Years later when it came out on the market a friend sitting next to me opened up a bag and I actually puked.  It was the worst smell memory ever.  To this day I still cant eat potato crisps. TLDR.   Low fat foods especially with Olestra are crap because it makes your crap smell horrible and was tested on animals. Edit about the Olestra in your foods....,ireland,d6i3vwt,9,t5_2qhb9

Both FF and SF ran terrible campaigns in Kerry last time out and I could see a lot of those votes that the HealyRaes picked up returning in those directions next time out. Ferris will retire next time out and the daughter will run and she will surely improve on a terrible effort from daddy. Fianna Fail will run  candidates Brasil and Moriarty plus one around Killarney town  if I had to call it now Id say the third would by John Joe Culloty as a sweeper.

Film Soc is a great idea. Join a couple of societies and clubs. You dont need to keep them all up but it will broaden your horizons.. Go to class. Dont worry too much about study that will come in due course but even physically sitting in the classroom you will find that things will slowly sink in and makes study a lot easier further down the line.. Go to all your class parties fresher a week Thursday nights random Tuesdays etc. College is  class work  social. If you only focus on one you will regret it later works both ways..

8736158,0,t1_d6xfte9,gt Feminists led a successful campaign in America to convince the FBI to change their definition of rape to include male victimsgt gt gt While that does help in some senses of male rape it is a side effect of the law change. the issue of Made to Rape is not covered nor advocated for. The very concept that made to penetrate is not rape comes from famed feminist researcher Mary Koss. She is one the researchers who decided to include that definition in the  CDC survey on intimate partner violence. She has also publicly expressed  that she does not consider femaleonmale sexual violence rape but rather unwanted sexual contact. That view is unfortunately common among feminists both in the United States and internationally. To this point when India attempted to change their law to acknowledge female rapists feminists opposed and successfully blocked the inclusion.Also worth noting that the major contemporary branch of feminism is the socalled radfems of which the former CEO of this site was one and a post about female on male rape removed. gt Feminists advocating for acknowledgement that women commit domestic violencegt gt Your title may be a bit hyperbolic here but the fact that someone who prefixes mens right groups as antifeminist can still admit that female on male or female on child violence is prevalent is still a good thing. Thats how low the bar is set here. Previously it was generally dismissed as either not happening or that he deserved it.gt Advocating against criminal sentencing disparities gt Advocating against male circumcisiongt gt gt This is something that really frustrates me. This has nothing to do with feminism or indeed patriarchy who even came up with that phrase?. This is about religion. FGM is abhorrent. MGM is abhorrent. But when you take your cues from a  year old desert tribe what do we expect. The Catholic Church are no different in their own way. You dont see stories in the mainstream news about the hoprrors of MGM. lets just take the gender prefix out of it completely and call it genital mutilation. Ban it and jail anyone guilty of it.gt Several feminists and feminist organizations advocating against discrimination against men regarding American citizenship requirementsgt gt NOW opposes the American draft but advocates that if it is to exist it must include women Link from  article? wow!

8837525,0,t3_518gow,A couple of reasons One they got scared shitless during the recession. They bough houses they were convinced they could flip for a profit during the boom if they just wait long enough. Imagine theyre surprise when they got caught with their trousers down when demand and value instantly dropped. Exploiting rent now is sort of doing two things making up for lost time and giving them insurance in case another drop in value hits. Two they know theyre in the advantageous position. They know people are clawing for places even shitty overpriced ones. You cant pay? Someone else can and will. Youre not the kind of tenant they want? Someone else will be. Hell once they can sell the place for more than the rent is worth they will. Theyve got us by the balls and know people have no other option. Three simple old fashion greed. Imagine you had a box that gave you the amount of money you wanted every month. After a while you get curious and ask for more. Surprise surprise you get it. Now you ask for more and more and you get it. You avoid looking after the box and fixing it just to save on the money you get. Thats what its like to rent property its like a money making machine. Of course youre gonna exploit it. Four theres no one saying they cant. Were either as good as were allowed to be or forced to be. And right now no one is saying boo to them. Theres next to no laws on price hikes no real investigative or supervising body and theyre in their own little club of landlords. Five they think theyre the good guys. A few weeks ago me and my GF stayed in an airbnb. The place was in my town and knew it was a student house only months prior. I talked to the owner as we were checking out asking if the place was available later in the year and remarked about it being a student house. He said the actual owner who he worked for stopped renting to students because of horror stories about places being trashed. Back in my student days Ive seen some shit shows rooms wallpapered in tin foil stairs smashed to pieces bonfires in the garden punch holes in walls so yeah I can see where hes coming from. Landlords problem hear horror stories from each other so if you have a finite amount of time before your property is wrecked youre probably gonna be selective on who you let in and for how much.A horror story I have is about our former neighbours. Nice people they were an Indian family. Quiet but said the polite hello when we met each other going in and our of our houses. Landlord comes a few months into renting Christmas Eve and says theyre out by the new year. I know they probably didnt celebrate Christmas but imagine that kicking someone out during Christmas. Turns out the landlord was giving the house to his son as a gift. Guess what? The son didnt want it so he rented it out to a different family. So a family lost their home just so nepotism can rule. Fuck landlords.,ireland,d7a59ag,18,t5_2qhb9

If not it can be found at  .It portrays advice given to a young woman regarding abortion. Almost all of this advice is of no scientific merit if not outright untrue. The safe option of pills to induce miscarriage is denied. Literature provided during this interview claimed that  percent of women report negative feelings about their abortion trusted and cited statistics put the figure closer to  percent.Due to a lack of regulation these services are free to target young and vulnerable women. A service claiming to be impartial and objective should not be allowed to offer false advice by agenda on such an important and sensitive issue of medicine.I would also at this time like to express my complete and enthusiastic support for the repealing of the th Amendment.I hope you are able to engage on this issue.Is mise,ireland,d7ao34v,5,t5_2qhb9

Breaking up the United Kingdom reshaping the Union Jack flag something that actually got discussed was not something that they wanted to face.

In Irish I was forced to analyse poetry short stories write a short story myself and do all of this without the ability to hold a conversation I didnt learn by rote. I went to one day Gaelscoil for  weeks one summer in Dublin and they ended up shouting at us in half Irish half English that we were talking too much English in our free time that we were destroying the course... Well guess what I arrived and you expected me to have a level of Irish that was so far above the reality that I had no incentive to even bother because I knew I wasnt going to improve. Im sure proper Gaelscoileanna are fine but I chose to do language courses in Germany instead.

Training yourself not to take in as many calories is difficult.And just adding exercise  burning more calories is not effective at weight loss Eating less and losing weight both lower your metabolism meaning you need to eat even less to keep the weight away. Exercising isnt great at boosting your metabolism.gt  A metaanalysis published last year  found that in the long term behavioural weight management programs that combine exercise with diet can lead to more sustained weight loss three to four pounds over a year than diet alone. Over a sixmonth period though adding exercise made no difference.I agree with you eating less is the key to losing weight.

Yes smokers will live shorter lives but theyll be invariably sicker on a more regular basis than nonsmokers and carry respiratory issues from their middle ages all the way through to old age. And modern medicine is very good at keeping people alive nowadays much longer than they could really hope for even  years ago. Smokers will still have elevated rates of cancer and other respiratory illnesses that have to be treated in any event.Also I dont see how Alzheimers and Dementia are expensive to treat. Care homes exist for people with these problems so hospitals dont have to take that burden on. Smokers will always be in AampE due to breathing difficulties etc and I would think all these things stack up in costs as opposed to whatever tax you pay on a regular  pack of fags.

9329809,0,t1_d8y03s5,The Irish Republic of  will only be won through the armed struggle. This border poll objective seems to have been thought up by some Walter Mitty character. The British Secretary of State must be satisfied of the desire for unity before consulting with cabinet and advocating for a poll.Then Cabinet would resolve their position on a poll before lobbying the rest of Westminster when a vote must be taken to pass a poll  relevant legislation required for that poll as any would need to be drafted the poll would be held under Westminster sovereignty County constituencies only involved meaning the Unionist veto enshrined and the prospect of unity impossible.However that will not seal the deal as as the British government still retains the power to have the final say on the matter a triple lock system as I think it is referred to. And after all that Irish Republicans and indeed those they have killed in the name of the Republic have been through such a set of circumstances renders the entire struggle as utterly futile.

If Germany had attempted to invade Ireland during WWII De Valeras policy would have been to seek British aid in driving them out.  In fact that was the whole crux of his neutrality in that war  the British strategic situation would become hopeless if they allowed Ireland to be occupied by Germany and so Dev knew that the British would have to come to Irelands aid.Neutrality is a policy that can be abandoned if need be.

They are not your mammy.Banks deliberately were misleading customers such as interest only with a fixed rate for a year than giving you a variable mortgage with a massively inflated rate. A bank is a business but it showed no duty of care to its customers or to the taxpayer was guaranteeing a lot of their deposits. gt If you are a taxi driver and bought  houses in Bulgaria youre a gobshite not an investor and the bank isnt to blame for your woes. So the customer who got the loan was a gobshite but the bank giving the loan wasnt? I think its the other way around mate. A bank manager should only approve a loan someone can actually pay. If their loan book goes sour the bank is done. I have seen freedom of info requests people made to their banks to see what their banks held on them. Their bank admitted on documents in their files that customer would be loss money on their investment properties.

Discussing something that the people of Northern Ireland are currently opposed to is disrespectful to their right to selfdetermination it is not our decision until they actually want to join us.gtAlso as per the GFA the Republic would need to pass a referendum on Irish unity too  not just the North.Stop being obtuse you know very well which party in this issue has the majority opposed to unification and it isnt the Republic. A referendum on Irish unity is not a concern until the North indicate that they have a desire to unify.gtAnd the Loyalist side doesnt? Said who? Stop being partisan the thread is about Gerry Adams statements and I dont have to give my entire opinion about everyone involved in Northern Irish politics in every comment I make about it just to appease people that get triggered when you criticise their side.gtSinn Fein are in government in the North and theyre the rd largest party in the Republic. Do you seriously think its reasonable to exclude them from unity talks?Of course not but Sinn Fein will continue to exist as a party well after Gerry Adams steps downleaves itdies. Him being the leader of Sinn Fein directly associates all of his personal baggage with the party and I believe that would have a negative effect on unity talks.This applies to parties on both sides before you start up again unity talks are far more likely to go well under less controversial figures that dont project an aura of past tensions.gtPartisan attitudes like yours really do my head in.

10065520,0,t1_dbiwjel,The funniest thing to me about research like this is that if you take a random citizen of Ireland and a random citizen of the UK and sequence their genes biological science cannot tell you which one is who.  Not statistically significantly anyways.  You could do thousands of people in the sample.  Wouldnt matter.  Truth of the fact is theres been too much mixing between the Isles for too many years for there to be any certain genetic difference at a  confidence interval.  But dummies...usually rightwing Americans...who read this stuff dont process it right.  They think Oh so some test run by some lady once in the UK found that people she tested in Ireland scored low.  Must be that people who are genetically Irish are born to be slow.They never stop to think about a thousand things.  Firstly The US aint the only multicultural country and theres no telling for sure what genes or ancestry any of the testtakers had.  Its not like its impossible to be an Irish citizen of Polish descent or likewise for the UK or anywhere else.Secondly they never ask questions like What age were the people tested?  What was their educational attainment?  What does their nation spend on education?  Did you control for these factors before making crosscomparison?Thirdly what is it that always happens with these sorts of studies over time?  Why are traditionally oppressed societies more likely to be singled out to have lower intelligence?  Why is it that if a country suddenly becomes wealthy like the USSR in the s and s or Japan in the s and s and China in the s and s that all of the sudden their scores pop up?  And when their economies fall a bit all of the sudden their scores go down?Its a stupid joke.,ireland,dbjk6v7,3,t5_2qhb9

Probably not therell always be the few who have absolutely no regard for anyone else.But the one or two crowd. Honestly why do you do it? I and anyone I know have a simple rule.

Having to travel in order to have an abortion would likely politicise you.Do the BAI think it was the other way around? That these people were rabid prochoicers who became pregnant in order to travel to the UK to get an abortion so they could have an opportunity to discuss intimate personal details publicly with a sanctimonious man who is famous for hosting a kids TV show featuring a wisecracking turkey?To follow the BAIs view a torture victim shouldnt be interviewed if they are also members of Amnesty International. What about Ray Darcy interviewing a recovering alcoholic telling him how his life has been wrecked by booze? Would that be OK? Would it still be OK if that same person was subsequently revealed to be a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association? Would the BAI then insist that Darcy have on somebody who is pro drink?

10173146,0,t1_dbx58cz,Your opinion means just as much I just wanted to point out some things from my experience when listening to people on either side argue an issue. One outright lie and misconception that ONLY is being tossed around this election cycle is that the electoral college was set up in response to the slave issue. Not sure if people in Ireland have been hearing this right now but essentially some people are suggesting that the electoral college is a racist institution. It was certainly and elitist position when it was created but if anything it was done so to prevent a demagogue from rising as a result of votes from the white male landowning population. Id argue that with the right for all adult Americans without felony charges to be allowed the right to vote this has actually allowed the very thing the founders were trying to avoid when they created the EC and I think this election cycle perfectly highlights it. With the IDs I would also agree with a cheap way to obtain an ID if it becomes mandatory. But here in New York state a nondriving license ID is only  dollars. Even assuming that you arent on welfare in which case you are given an ID I cant not imagine how in a year hell even two years you would not be able to afford  dollars to get an ID especially as New York City cops WILL give you a two hundred dollar citation ticket if you dont have some ID on your person. I bring up the ID issue mainly because I do believe that its as concerning of an issue as the current state of the electoral college. For example some people have made the suggestion that if you remove California from the map Trump would have won the popular vote. Now when you look at Californias demographics and state laws there is an obvious concern highest rates of illegal immigrants and NO state ID law to vote. I cant speak for all counties and localities but the state itself does not monitor it. As opposed to New York State you have to show some form of ID which is quickly cross referenced from your district. If you do not have an ID such as the gentleman ahead of me they give you an absentee ballot where you have to put your social security number so that they can cross reference who you are when they count the absentee ballots a few weeks later. In California there are no such laws. ,ireland,dbx6khy,-1,t5_2qhb9

10238250,0,t1_dc4ijdo,Isis are only a concern in the first place because they serve a purpose.  There arent that many of them and most of the ones who have committed attacks were well known to authorities.  If the authorities wanted to do something they would.  It also has nothing at all to do with anti racism thats just what they say to keep shoving in polarisation and uncertainty so that well keep looking for leadership from the authorities because nothing pulls a population into line like a common enemy. After the  crash things werent looking too hot and the far left became a threat along with certain elements of the far right but they decided to try and fuck us up first because before this migrant crisis we were the major threat so they invited a whole heap of people from the middle east made them walk here and hassled them at every border just to make sure it was mostly the young strong men who were able to make it then refused to properly look after them after they invited them to makea sure they were good and pissed off. Now seen as the far right are on the rise they are looking to send them back because their plan backfired and they still cant pull the natives together and rally us behind them because none of our needs are being met. If you think that the European leaders are just idiots clinging to progressive hopes and dreams you are a fool. If you think that continuing to antagonise them is going to fix this you are a fool. We are stuck in a feedback loop where the far right are feeding the islamists and the islamists are feeding the far right.  And its not surprising because religion aside they are very similar ideologically.  We are getting  odd migrants and are putting them in the middle of nowhere.  They are not a threat. We have no soft targets and are not very high up their priority list. I dont believe they would try to actively avoid hurting us but we give them no advantage and where as our sports fans or something might be collateral damage in an attack somewhere else they arent going to be bothered hitting us directly.

10325318,0,t1_dceeyu9,Its hard to say in general because if you say corruption you need proof and thats not easy to come by even if the perception is there.  I think the DUP and SF are corrupt but in different ways. The DUP have close links with businesses that want easy non competitive tenders red sky comes to mind nevermind individual orangemen who may own businesses. Sinn Feins corruption is a bit different its about getting as much money from the British as possible fake research companies and good luck getting a job in anything linked to them unless youre a party member and laughing all the way to the bank. No idea about the SDLP but they are practically a dead party and Fianna Fail will take their votes. I dont think Alliance are corrupt though. Theyre cautious and careful not to offend in general and havent been in positions of huge influence apart from the odd department and having a Justice minister who was held in very high regard by everybody. All the corruption aside Id give Fianna Fail a preference no sweat. I dont like them but its not about that. Its about who I can give a better kick up the hole. Im lucky enough I live in one of the few constitutencies south belfast that is a bit different. We got a very good Green MLA elected against the odds.

And chopping onions? haha thats something so trivial  its gas that would annoy you P  Im not really set in ways as such. I moved out when I was  against all advice  because I thought I knew better. I left my cosy little bedroom in Sligo and all my family and friends and headed off to the bright lights of Belfast.   It was a fecking shitshow. I found work easily enough but two things got me. Id never tried drugs before and Id never actually been in a relationship before.   Soon enough I was constantly high on something and in a relationship at the same time and it was hell. We both hated each other and were basically just in it for the sex.  The sucky thing is that I was the one that was so naive and stupid that I kept trying to make things work even though it was doomed from the start.  Next relationship was even worse  It started off well enough but then just seemed to nosedive off a cliff. I got the shit kicked out of me a few times and was usually covered in bruises. Thankfully none of them were anywhere people would see them all legs or torso.  The worst bit was that it was all Id ever known so I just let it continue. I remember how I used to walk around with my head down all the time and would never look anyone in the eye because I was afraid of people   Eventually I got out of that one too but those were my first relationships and my first real interactions with other adults and theyve really made me afraid of people. I used to be a very trusting little kid and Id  have done anything for anyone.  Now I try to do anything to avoid anyone  regardless if it is a relationship or not I have a deep distrust of people that I just cant shake.  Heh thats a bit of a rant  sorry I didnt intend for it to be so long. Ill give a summary!  TLDR I hate people and dont want them in my house.  ,ireland,dckb890,1,t5_2qhb9

I think it did make a difference. He has acknowledged that his fear of abortion on demand is what makes him resistant to any sort of change to the eight regardless of how many people suffer as a result.    yup. most prolifers feel this way. this shouldnt surprise you. if i believed life started at conception id be willing to force people to suffer too. thankfully i dont.    gtI disagree OP is using very emotive language claiming there is an abortionist around every corner he is voicing his fears. People like me who voice their experiences do a better job of framing the situation dont you think?   was this in PMs? they said very little before in the thread here before nuking it. i didnt see them say anything of the sort here but am open to being corrected. regardless i agree that emotive arguments are shit and unproductive. that applies to BOTH sides though. calling someone a babykiller is pointless. so is pulling the oh yeah well what if your sister was raped card. im not defending the OP here im sure me and himher would agree on very little its the reaction from the subreddit to this specific thread that interested me.    gtHe deleted it almost right away after I made my comment and like I said we followed it in PMs. He was not prepared to deal with real life scenarios he just wanted to scaremonger about abortion clinics on every street corner.  so after he deleted the thread here and you guys went at it in PMs you edited in your shit got too real  him to the comment in the thread here? seems triumphalist redundant and petty tbh.    gtPerhaps the reason you dont see a balanced discussion is because the issue isnt balanced. The current situation is indefensible pro lifers tend to resort to their faith or their exaggerated fears of a slippery slope to abortion on demand as an excuse to deny basic medical services to people today.   horseshit. there are very strong arguments for banning abortion in almost all circumstances. in my opinion there are slightly stronger arguments in favour of allowing it. pretending its so black and white is ludicrous and makes me wonder if youve ever had a lengthy rational conversation on the issue with a prolifer.  gtThats a tough position to defend Im not surprised it attracts downvotes...     it attracts downvotes because rireland is massively prochoice thats it. voting scores have little to do with right or wrong or quality of argument. i could start a thread claiming all prolife people are closet paedophiles who just want more children around to abuse and get upvoted for it for fecks sake.,ireland,dd0zr7n,0,t5_2qhb9

10546711,0,t1_dd3g9u1,Its a statistical model. The statement lower wages increase corruption is mathematically equivalent to higher wages decrease corruption. Thats why its relevant. You seem now now specifying that lowering wages as opposed to low wages will cause corruption. But youre giving no evidence for that in fact youre claiming that evidence is impossible but you somehow are still able to come to this conclusion? How?I reckon that since the evidence says that low wages dont increase corruption in rich countries and since there is absolutely nothing forcing politicians to stay in politics then lowering wages will cause a load of people to switch jobs and other most likely less competent people will run for office but they wont be any more corrupt. Im willing to be proved wrong by evidence.gtBut it isnt the industrial wage thats changing here nor calculating the effectiveness of a pay raise.Your quote is one of their data sources from which they built the model. Read the conclusion which Ive already quoted from. Im on mobile so Im not going to spend time formatting it. If you want it formatted go to the link. gt. ConclusionsThe impact of government wages on corruption is moderated by the level of per capita income. When income per capita is relatively low higher government wages reduce corruption. This negative impact reduces as the level of income increases and eventually becomes positive though insignificant. Intuitively petty corruption is more prevalent in poor countries and well paid bureaucrats forgo such type of corruption. However when income is higher petty corruption becomes less important. Grand corruption involving more secret transactions that violate the laws and regulations becomes prevalent. This type of corruption brings about larger revenues that outweigh any realistic compensation package to the corrupted bureaucrats. It is also more difficult to detect. To combat the latter form of corruption increasing government wages might not be efficient.Our results are robust. The impact of government wages on corruption is significant even if we lag our government wage indicator in order to deal with possible reverse causality. Likewise using latitude instead of income to deal with multicollinearity problems does not change our main results. Of course taking the lags of potentially endogenous variables and using latitude as a proxy for income are not perfect solutions to the econometric problems. Still the robustness tests indicate that our results are not spurious.Several policy implications can be drawn from this study. Higher government wages only reduce corruption in lowincome countries. Government wages may not be an efficient policy tool to reduce corruption in upper middle or highincome countries with a relatively high level of corruption such as Greece and Italy. In lowincome countries increasing wages may substantially reduce corruption.,ireland,dd3l5vf,1,t5_2qhb9

10678705,0,t3_5ssa9e,I think first off all you should shop around and get a better price. Different policies have different coverage so talk to the various providers to get a better price. What is the reason for your coverage. Do you have health insurance because you are worried some day you will get really sick and what good health care. Are you someone that is constantly being referred to consultants by your GP and having to wait  years  for an appointment. Do you play sports or have a job that has you worried about injuries. Tailor your plan to what you need. All plans normally include free treatment in a private hospital. Some policies cover full consultant fee and GP fees some only cover partial fees. Private consultants generally have   a  to  week waiting list vs  years for public consultants. If a consultants recommences surgery  this is normally covered by your policy and again without long waiting lists. ,ireland,ddhfein,1,t5_2qhb9

That is to say between getting lubed up by our neighbors and the odd wee famine weve left the island a fair bit. Anybody with a connection to our island or our history knows that their ancestors have been victimized at some point in their lives. To do the same because others have failed and out of fear is just cowardly.  Im not some SJW twat but Im not some far right coward either. Of course theres terrorists and yes Islam is violent. But Im willing to work at it and people like Pegida refuse to. Theyre the poster boys for jihadists everywhere and they refuse to admit it.Ill treat people as people that is to say with common sense. People are bastards and theyre not bastards too. For example Germany was unimaginably stupid to allow mass migration from a war zone with little to no vetting. Unimaginably stupid. The government obv not the German people as a whole.I dont know what the right answer is to be fair Im no politician nor strategist but I know the wrong answer. The current stance of blaming Muslims will only fuel the fire. Its an easy out much like the cuddle bunnies idea of there being not a single violent Muslim in the world that does not serve to solve the issue. Most of the time its echoing an opinion so you fit in with we crowd youre hanging out with that day.gt Lastly its not the s any more. The world has massively permanently changed.The only thing that has changed is the colour of the skin and the country of origin. I wonder who theyll blame next if they actually achieve their goals? I guarantee you itll never be themselves. All issues will be blamed on some foreign boogyman. rantI feel like a bloody Yank writing all that but it has to be said.

10956775,0,t3_5whqwp,Tesco Ireland saw sales across its store network fall significantly after picket lines were placed outside a small number of its shops.The dispute centred around proposed contract changes to about  longserving staff.The Mandate trade union which represents staff employed by the retail giant called off its strike action on Friday night as Tesco agreed to put contract changes on hold to allow a new round of Labour Court talks take place.However figures seen by The Irish Times reveal the high price Tesco has already paid for the day dispute with sales in some shops where pickets were placed falling by almost  per cent and by more than  per cent in stores where no pickets were placed.Mandate claims management is attempting to enforce contract changes which would see wages of staff recruited before  fall by more than  per cent a claim strongly denied by Tesco.The first pickets were placed on eight shops on February th with a further eight being picketed almost a week later.Tesco strike suspended to allow for Labour Court talksStriking Tesco workers reassured over family income supplementTesco strikers They wont undermine us. This is not a gamePublic supportTesco had played down the support the strike had among the general public and its impact on sales and claimed last week stores were trading well through the dispute.However the internal figures conflict with this account. They indicate Tescos small branch in Drumcondra Dublin recorded sales of over  on the Monday prior to the strike while the following Monday when there was a picket outside the store sales fell to .In the nearby Phibsborough and Stoneybatter branches sales of about  and  respectively on the Monday before the strike fell to just over  and under  a week later.The figures suggest the single biggest fall in sales in a store where strike action was taking place was recorded in the large Clearwater branch in Finglas. On the Monday before the strike sales were  while a week later they were under  a drop of  or nearly  per cent.Sales in other stores on strike  including Monaghan Navan and Blanchardstown  reported declines of a similar scale.Other branchesEven shops without pickets saw sales slump in the wake of the strike. Daily sales of  were recorded in the Tesco Extra in Clarehall on the Monday before the strike while the following Monday with pickets on other stores sales were  a decline of more than  per cent.The fall between the two Mondays across  stores of all sizes totalled .If a similar fall in sales was recorded across Tescos entire network of  stores the daily drop before and after the strike started would be in excess of  million. As Mondays are traditionally a quiet day for supermarkets the decline at the weekends could have been even sharper.A daily loss of that scale would suggest the cumulative impact of the day strike came close to  million and while the retailer has a longestablished policy of not revealing its profit margins in the Republic such a decline in sales could have seen at least  million wiped off its bottom line.When asked to comment on the scale of the dropoff in sales and how it squared with its earlier claims that stores had traded strongly during the dispute a Tesco spokeswoman said it had always maintained that inevitably there has been some impact on trade as a result of the industrial action which is to be expected.The spokeswoman declined to address specific queries about the scale of the decline in sales.,ireland,dea43c7,27,t5_2qhb9

11027646,0,t1_dehy2lg,From what I know justification for abortion on demand outside the political realm derives from a womans right to bodily integrity.Specifically you will hear the prochoice crowd and feminists constantly argue that no one but the woman has a right to enforce on a woman how she must treat her body. They say that forcing a woman to carry to term  a pregnancy she does not want is a violation of her own body. It is my understanding that the ECHR grants a woman an equivalent right to selfdetermination bodily integrity in bodily matters as for men. In our case it seems to be overt religisiosity and a nebulously defined term the unborn that stands in the way of this. Legislation which grants personhood and thus rights upon a foetus without a clear scope for when it does and does not attach.From what I know removal of the th would allow women to assert that they have the sole and unrestricted right to determine whether they carry to term or not. The only limitation being the willingness of a medical provider to perform a procedure to terminate. ,ireland,dehyitb,1,t5_2qhb9

I assume they meant since the crash but I was going back to our initial stages as an Independent nation to illustrate how hard it can be to become a fullfledged independent nation when youre right next door to an industrial powerhouse. Scotland is in a better position now than we were in the s. We were a basket case at first but its largely to do with not being an industrial country. We tried putting tarrifs on British goods but they unfairly responded in kind and have dominated the Irish market ever since. I agree Scotland are not postcolonial in the same way we were or even worse India. The Scots were indeed colonists  wannabe ones anyway. That business in Panama is why theyre now British but thats long ago and theyve become subjects of Westminster. Moreover it was Scottish elites playing the empire game not the public. Id be pissed off if I was a Scot  the condescending tone from May today on the news was infuriating. Imagine that muppet Conor Cruise OBrien wanted Ireland to rejoin the UK.

Finally if your definition of best is simply cheapest then buy a Leap Card from one of the shops in the airport get the number  bus from the airport to Trinity College then the number  to Heuston Station then train to Cork and change for Cobh.

I do hope that both Paisley and McGuiness have biographies written about that time  which will be released to future generations in the mid st century  for it is an amazing story.There were seriously hard men on both sides  and to turn around and say that the past  years was a waste takes some courage and guts and a ton of charisma..  and with the threat of being shot by your own side.

Eventually regionalist movements emerge in the periphery to tackle local problems and to get attention from London. The regionalists succeed in getting some sort of devolved government set up and eventually gain control of it due to allBritish parties sending their best politicians to Westminster. Alternatively Labours best go into regional politics since theyre locked out of London. On the one hand Labour politicians will be less nationalist but on the other hand it strengthens the Tory monopoly that weakens the UK in the long run. In practice the latter dominates look at how Carwyn Jones has gone full on nationalist to protect Wales from the centre. Areas closer to the centre complain the periphery is getting too much money creating tensions. As London weakens further the regional elites takes more and more power for themselves. The Tories kick the region out to keep their hegemony over everywhere else weakening the UK further. Back to start,ireland,df9arwh,2,t5_2qhb9

Bus Eireann gets a Public service obligation for running rural transport routes which are not viable without a subsidy. This hefty subsidy means that Bus Eireann breaks even on their rural public service routes despite their ridiculous cost structure. BUS EIREANN EXPRESSWAY is a commercial operator competing on commercial routes and they dont get a subsidy because the routes dont require a subsidy. They are getting slaughtered because they are shit at running buses. These routes dont get Public service obligation subsidies because they are viable routes without them. The route from Dublin Galway does not require state funding to be viable. Hence it doesnt get one. Not all bus routes are the same. If Bus Eireann expressway cant compete on those commercial routes then its the same as any of the literally thousands of Irish businesses who go to the wall every single year to make room for new more productive companies. Or they cut costs and compete. I support Public service rural bus routes. That is not what this is about at all. Its about a commercial operation which cant compete. ,ireland,dfnytad,20,t5_2qhb9

11435676,0,t1_dfs5oqr,One of they keys with sentencing is the principle of proportionality. The punishment has to fit the crime. The judge looks at the sentence available in legislation then weighs up aggravating and mitigating factors. Often times sentences are appealed and the appeal court workload reflects this madness and arguments are made for mitigating factors for the person convicted.In terms of sexual offences there are a number of authorities which are slightly conflicting. In DPP v Tiernan the SC said that rape should normally result in a substantial immediate custodial sentence. DPP v NY put it forward that suspended sentences in some circumstances is okay. But in DPP v Keane a suspended sentence was quashed by the Court of Appeal because it was too lenient and Tiernan was restated giving a  year sentence. On top of all this you have underlying principles that gives leniency when it comes to issues like old age infirmity and in this case here time elapsed. Theres an underlying issue that rape is not treated seriously enough to begin with but thats more to read back on that I cant find atm.Initially when I read this I thought wow  years is a long time because generally we dont see sentences for rape that go much further than this. In recent times I suppose as well weve seen more controversy with suspended sentences in lieu of payment to the victim and inconsistency between similar crimes with different judges.As for sleeping at night I just assume that most judges are hooked up to a dialysis machine filled with brandy and vampire blood so they probably dont need to sleep. They cant stop because the cumulative hangover may kill them.Edit I should mention as well this really depends on the person. Some people may favour the rehab and debt to society route others may go so far as hanging the fucker.

11575395,0,t1_dg7yaur,Classifying food as healthy or unhealthy is flawed from the start.Usually when people tak about healthy foods they mean foods that are high in micronutrients while being low in calories which many vegetables fall into along with some fruits. Avocados are not one of these as they are very high in fat and therefore per gram in calories.Really healthy and unhealthy refer not to foods but to portions. Eating half an avocado with a salad is healthy. Eating  of them for lunch not so much. The problem with this kind of blanket classification of foods without respect to how many calories per gram is in the food is that it leads to people believing they can eat as much as they want of a food without gaining weight or experiencing negative health effects.

Public sector pay. Transport. Health. Housing. And so on. They just require the govt to decide they are public goods worth preserving. In the case of housing the objective is to return to precrisis home prices so that all those sitting in negative equity will be sorted and everybody who looks to profit from home sales and builds will be incentivised once again.

One would be foolish in the extreme to believe that such an assumption exists unless it is guaranteed by law. The standard advice otherwise is not to put into writing anything which you would not be comfortable seeing published.Acting as though you have confidentiality when you dont is a recipe for being very upset later.

11763442,0,t1_dgteft1,gtBy who?Lol are you joking? Most people would consider Irish culture being our language Gaelic games Halloween Irish music and dancing etc. All of which is mostly derivative from Gaelic Ireland. Whats your idea of Irish culture?gt BTW the ancient Gaels styled their hair with European waxes and wore continental style tunics. They also greatly admired the Greeks. Of course if you were alive back then youd be complaining about that too.All cultures assimilate bits and pieces from others as time goes on.  Most of what we now call traditional Irish music is derived from English French and Spanish folk music picked up by soldiers on their campaigns and brought back to Ireland.  English soccer is itself derived from ball games that would bear many similarities with the ancestors of Gaelic football. I hardly seek to eradicate all traces of foreign culture from Ireland.,ireland,dgteysp,1,t5_2qhb9

That is honestly the consensus in Ireland and amongst the Irish particularly after what has happened with Brexit.Of course Enda Kenny tried to pander to the Americans with his glib announcement of a potential referendum allowing Irish citizens abroad to vote in Irish presidential elections. However there is not a hope in hell that referendum would pass if it were even to take place because of the issue with how easily our citizenship is handed out to people who claim tenuous ancestral links to the current modern country that we are citizens of.We know all about Americans with Irish heritage. This does not make those Americans Irish. It means they have Irish ancestry. This is precisely why we feel out citizenship is too easy to attain. That and the results of Brexit on our citizenship.Like I said parents should be fully entitled to pass their citizenship to their children.
