7789966,0,t3_4m12oo,Just came across this old review when searching for N stuff. Couldnt see whether its been posted before but just thought Id post it since this sub isnt too active anyway Sums up pretty well how I feel about the game. My favourite part gt Theres so much more for you to try! N says.gt gt But Im tired I reply. That stage took me an hour!gt gt But we made this for you! N shouts back.,nplusplus,d3rnd8c,1,t5_31hoj

8865225,0,t3_50ki0j,It would be cool to have some people that are actually interested in watching replays and playingmaking some custom levels. I am not even close to done with the main game yet so I havent spent a lot of time in custom levels yet but that can change if I actually had some good ones to play.,nplusplus,d7dh4o0,1,t5_31hoj
8971522,0,t3_508qo8,I thought this was a design choice. When playing some levels it seems like the door blocks off some of the gold meaning you have to collect it before you hit the door button.,nplusplus,d7q8p2q,1,t5_31hoj
9144433,0,t1_d7og4gz,not sure if anybody will stumble upon this comment but now that ive beaten all the secret levels i might as well share some of the more difficult ones from there as well. again i only beat these levels to completion and this is based on number of deaths.also this is definitely spoiler territory so if you care about that sort of thing and you didnt even know there were secret levels until you just read this then feel free to click that  next to my username?C occams razor razor p neat laser puzzle but i swear i always make it like one step further in these puzzles and then immediately die because im in a situation i havent encountered before V?E hypercomplexity well supercomplexity was already pretty messy so that but with tinier  faster micro drones just makes things that much more difficult. on top of that its pretty easy to skip entire sections of supercomplexity by boosting through the toggle mines but here you dont have that option at all and have to go the long way.?E exploder in chief i cant remember the exact level this is based off of atm but this is basically that level except with a finicky little area involving a floor guard attached to it. like the level its based on this is actually pretty fun to find a route for i kinda dig it?D laserassisted cognition the timing in this level just felt off the whole time i mustve died to each laser like  times?E strike four already a fairly messy level with the micro drones but getting enough speed to make that jump past the mines on the right wall is BRUTAL. in fact i didnt even fucking do it i had to get lucky and jump inbetween two mines to make it to the exit?E symbolic frolic pretty much like hypercomplexity but its a remix of symbolic act. that being said if you could get through symbolic act then this levels a lot less daunting?C crowding you would think this is an easy level but the order you have to get the switches in involves so much backtracking that this level turns into a race against time and having to move incredibly quickly around a bunch of drones is daunting to say the least?E oh imperfect memory this level becomes unmanageable if you have like  evil ninjas following you around so most of the challenge lies in trying to avoid all as many of those evil ninja portals as you can while grabbing the two switches that you need to beat the level?B whoop  evil ninjas and you have to go across  times... that being said this is probably my favorite evil ninja level in the game so this is probably up your alley if you liked tenfold crossing?E the mad addler metanet actually talked about this level in their GDC talk they say that theres only one correct sequence of jumps you have to use to beat this level which i find dubious so naturally its gonna take quite a few deaths to find that route,nplusplus,d8b4evh,1,t5_31hoj
