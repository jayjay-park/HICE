We have a stickied thread where we note banned users and comments that led to their bans.Then they amended them by adding timelimited bans With that amendment I cant see any rule theyve broken.,starslatecodex,cvkuucc,2,t5_3a5qc
5503870,0,t3_3qhcm4,gt I agree with the goals of feminism for  of the movements existence!I guess were not even mean to take the  number seriously.  But if we did then perhaps that would mean anything but the last  to  years or so.So for example when in  the entire feminist movement in the USA demanded and got a law making it illegal to help male victims of domestic violence well thats a goal that this rationalist agrees with I guess.But this nitpicking highlights a rather bigger problem which is that this rationalist and the same is true of the others simply has no idea what feminists used to get up to but rushes to endorse it anyway.Clearly this rush to endorse feminism of the past is a emotional need for rationalists.  Why?Well the question of feminism is clearly a big issue splitting them up and this is used as an arbitrary and irrational way to endorse without endorsing.  A compromise between two sets of irrational  emotional positions.,starslatecodex,cwf65rs,2,t5_3a5qc
