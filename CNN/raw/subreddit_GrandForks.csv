6634144,0,t1_d04ca7o,Chipotle  Target. Qdoba  Walmart. If that makes any sense. Heres another one... Chipotle  Macys amp Qdoba  Sears. Yea theyre set up the same share similar concepts but the quality amp overall in this case taste is much better at Chipotle  Well in most peoples opinion! Chipotle only buys from local farms amp uses hormone free cages free free range products... Yaddah yahhdah yaaahhhdaaaahhhh... I just think it tastes about  better than Qdoba. Here this analogy might make more sense.... Lets just say Qdoba  McDonalds amp Chipotle  HardeesWendys. Yes both are fast food. Share similar qualities. But theres just the extra bit of mmmppffft that makes one noticeably better than the other. In my humble opinion amp in most peoples opinions that I have had this conversation with in person ...chipotle is just better. No offense to Qdoba. Its fine... But def not as good as chipotle!!!!!  ,GrandForks,d05j0c6,2,t5_2t1bp
