3018692,0,t1_co899jv,I wanted to mention what Opheo wrote Arkoonius the first paragraph I dont know enough about the mechanics of the game yet to discuss the finer points of the disease skill. Youve painted an ideal scenario for the Deceiver. Humans dont notice you coming you land and spread the disease to all of them because they happen to be standing as close to each other as possible pop illusions they manage to block all the humans attacks AND you manage to get around  melee attacks in before slinking away unscathed. Then when talking about Tyrant you mention that its unlikely hell land a perfect jump attack as humans wont be standing so close together which is exactly what the Deceiver would require to pull off the same. The beauty in Nosgoth and games like it DOTA comes to mind is the asymmetry of the classes. Each and every class CAN be OP in certain specific scenarios which really makes those moments when you can pull of that amazing quad kill just so awesome. Unless some numbers on a skillclass are consistently high enough that teams with said classability start winning significantly more often then there is no problem and nothing has to be done. Theres beauty in nonsterile nonwatereddown character powers that everyone can enjoy and youll be on both ends of that multiple times. It just sucks when youre the one getting smacked.,nosgoth,coavvbm,1,t5_2wx92
3038933,0,t1_cocz3ff,It comes down to game sense and practice as well as your team actually putting it to use but here are some points to consider when throwing it.. Use it to force humans to move away from a strong location they prefer to stand at. Have it between you and the humans so it masks your approach.. Throw it between groups of humans you can potentially isolate  guys and then assassinate them with the rest of your team. Engage as soon as the smoke pops if not just before. If you give the humans  extra seconds to relocate and then go in it isnt nearly as effective. . If you stand near the centre of the smoke or at the back of it relative to the humans they cant see you if you are near the edge they still can. Charged attacks from smoke are great but make sure you know they cant see you when doing it.. Throw it onto the scouts face so he cannot charge shot anyone and needs to drop his draw saving you the potential  damage hit as you initiate.. Try to judge what your team is doing and throw the smoke when it looks like they are in position and ready to go in. If you throw it and nobody acts you more or less need to wait until it is up again to have a proper initiation unless your team is flat out better than the one you are playing against. ,nosgoth,coczfqa,8,t5_2wx92

3130377,0,t1_comg0hy,I think in general the maps are fine they just need to adjust the problem areas thats not exactly an overhaul.  Respawns DO need a major overhaul but I also dont think that would be difficult to implement it doesnt have to be complex it just shouldnt respawn people next to other players or in the center of the map.  An even easier method would be to simply increase the respawn timer slightly which would make it much harder to deny corpses and much less likely youre going to get respawned on and shotout mid fight.  The TDM ranged vs melee issue is largely an issue because humans have these one or two wide open areas where vamps have to run across a field getting shot to engage hence readjusting the maps.  For instance on Valeholm if the center circular structure had cover for vamps to hide behind it would be much easier to assault the bridge area as it stands its virtually impossible to throw a smoke without getting shot or get anywhere near the bridge without taking a few pot shots if not outright dying to things like war bows.  Vamps could also have more cover or a tunnel up top to get around to the back similar to what we see at the fountain area in the Fane.    The point I was trying to make is adjusting maps would be a very healthy way of addressing the problem as it would not have a significant impact on lower level play which the devs have stated as a major concern of theirs.  On the other hand nerfing humans would make lowlevel play extremely unfun and for that reason its just not something the devs are going to do.,nosgoth,comgmc5,3,t5_2wx92

3192453,0,t3_2wmk4m,Controversial opinion inbound.I feel like TDM is such a lackluster lazy filler mode that despite being fun has absolutely abysmal staying power. On top of all that I believe given sandbox options for private lobbies people can always default to this game mode if they want to have a bit of fun. Just look at games like League of Legends. The meat and potatoes is a well thought out game mode with amazing amounts of depth that keeps players logged in for thousands of hours. Does anyone honestly think that would be possible if the main game mode was ARAM? To me TDM is merely a training ground to hone skills that people will need to master when a proper mode is developed that takes strategy deeper than humans clustering together in a section of the map taking potshots at vampires that are forced to engage under the humans terms.,nosgoth,coswbq8,2,t5_2wx92

Hunter and prophet both gain the most from this because theyre the ones who usually spam their ammo more over the other three. Alchemist I see usually run quick hands as well because only having  shots at most while each does good damage can back fire Id you miss a few body shots. And typically if youre playing smart youll stay by the aoe and vampires usually go for the classes that have cc so youll have time to make use of quick hands. As for scout its kinda preferences. Quick hands does work but usually youll get more out of reduced spread if youre able to poke from far away. And since the class is vulnerable you usually dont have time to get  shots off and reload while being attacked. TLDR  quick hands is never a bad option. ,nosgoth,cowy7yw,1,t5_2wx92

3726877,0,t1_cqh2wgr,The thing about  Tyrants isnt so much a class problem rather a design of the game problem. Any class if there are  of them breaks the game in different ways. For example three Deceivers mean three easy infects that are free to hit since it is nigh impossible Im aware of the methods to see him theyre unrealistic in many cases though to see an invisible Deceiver.The combo of Marathon  Ability is not always dodgeable but these often come from positioning of Humans. Since Humans almost always choose where the fight happens they can force themselves into places that make it hard to charge into. Thus preventing the combo from occurring. If you are in a spot where a charge can easily come from many directions it is a fault in your positioning. This is not always the case due to map design but can be controlled and limited by players.The example I gave with Jump was an extreme case normally I do use it after another has distracted the Humans.

4160933,0,t1_crtm865, Im afraid that is incorrect. The Ironguard are not descendants or remnants of the Sarafan just another group that resist the vampires. The original Sarafan have been gone for nearly two thousand years by the time of Nosgoth the BO Sarafan which are explicitly not the same and just named Sarafan  to inspire are gone by over a thousand and were not even formed in this timeline to begin with. Beyond the tenuous links of the prophets there are no remnants of anything left that wasnt eliminated by Kain. Granted there could be knowledge kept by vampires away from humans but that still does not automatically mean all the stuff from centuries past in different timelines is automatically known by all  it is inaccurate myth and legend by now revered but not matched. Incidentally the Ironguard  are merely a human resistance to vampires  there have been many before them and few are connected by concrete links to other hunting orders  the only concrete links the Ironguard has is that they are the predecessors of the Vampire Hunters of SR. ,nosgoth,cruk1ci,0,t5_2wx92

4452757,0,t3_3c3hxz, Long queue times Unbalanced matches Slow development Bugsissues that are never addressed Poor performance Hit registration issues Focus on new features and cosmetics instead of core gameplay improvementsTake your pick. It is a fun game at its core but it is in a poor state in many ways. Sadly I dont think its potential will ever be realized. There just doesnt seem to be any indication that things are going to be straightened out. Many long term supporters are no longer playing while very few new players are trying out the game. Those that do tend to get relentlessly stomped by the remaining core playerbase of vets. The game needs a strong playerbase to create good fair matches and to keep queue times down. It is going to take a small miracle to attract that playerbase. Id love to see it happen but it seems very unlikely at this point.,nosgoth,csryd0o,30,t5_2wx92
4537840,0,t1_ct2kc7c,Exactly this.Nosgoth doesnt have high hardware requirements compared to other games. You dont need a top notch PC to play it fluidly on maxed settings.If you cant play this chances are you cant play any new game except minimalistic indie stuff that doesnt d render that much.You might want to think about either cleansing your system from performance eating background crap or buying new hardware once every  years...My multipleyearsold rig is far off of the actual highend by now and I have zero problems playing it on max settings.tldr Pentium III Mhz gt polish sausage gt your rig,nosgoth,ct2mj30,3,t5_2wx92

4915719,0,t3_3i5gzb,I ended in Blood IV as well since I found little reason to keep playing matches after that other than for fun since itd be very unlikely to get into Eternal. Eternal rank is fairly appropriately named since if you want to stay there thats how long you have to play.,nosgoth,cue5wwn,1,t5_2wx92
4984708,0,t1_cuhy60y,Previously her summons would take a certain amount of damage from AOE attacks as in attacks from Humans. For instance Volley the Scout attack. We reduced how much damage the summons take from AOE attacks so the focus is more on shooting them to take them out rather than spamming AOE attacks.  No newsinfo at this time on a voting system but if you had any specific suggestions or feedback on that Im happy to pass it on!,nosgoth,cumubb3,1,t5_2wx92
5028937,0,t1_curf0pr,Jokester or not it still falls under the gamut of this post which is to block annoying or unfriendly players. Sure its a joke but Id rather not have youre a piece of shit spammed across my screen either.,nosgoth,cus6fvf,5,t5_2wx92

5233621,0,t1_cvg47bx,I dont know what you have against Dead Sun Silent but I completely disagree with getting rid of him. Hes one of the very few that post regular Nosgoth videos and one of the most talented that does so. If it wasnt for his tutorials I would be way worse and not enjoying the game nearly as much.Dev transparency isnt going to happen. I seen in a previous thread that there is  of them. If thats true do you really think they have time to sit here and personally address issues? No theyre busy beyond belief which is why the CMs exist.Summoner and Vanguard both have their place in the game especially with the inclusion of the new abilities. Maybe you just need to learn to counter them?,nosgoth,cvgub4r,1,t5_2wx92

5331122,0,t1_cvszbak,I know this guy and have played against him many many times. Enough times to know that hes a hugely egotistic narcissistic cunt who thinks hes hot shit. Hes been around for a long time like me and may or may not cheat but given that Ive never seen his POV in either a video or a stream I wont call it definitely either way. I can confidently say however that Ive never seen another player hit as many nutty bolas as that guy pulls out of his ass. In fact Ive never seen him miss a bola not against me anyway and Im not so bad as a sentinel.,nosgoth,cvt3zu7,3,t5_2wx92
5396317,0,t1_cw1dzdk,Match making cant function right now regardless of whether it is a good system or not. The playerbase is more likely to grow when garbage mechanics like queue dodging are removed. This can only be a good thing for the game. ,nosgoth,cw1fu11,2,t5_2wx92
5492952,0,t3_3qbos1,The only chest that contains those are skins is the Exalted Treasure of the Kings chest thats sold for  runestones in the ingame store. You can actually see what the chests contain by pressing the View Contents button in the store after you select a chest.As for droprates Im not sure too sure. I bought a few chests back when they first came out and got the alchemist skin. But theyve since added Arcane weapons as a possible drop which significantly reduced the skin droprates. In the end is up to you if you want to spend money or not. Personally I wouldnt after the nerf as I really dislike the random drops. If I could pay  runetones more even for just the skins I would though.,nosgoth,cwdry3l,2,t5_2wx92

I disagree a lot with you in that case.Happened to me once that PC crashed back in  mins later and we were far ahead but the game was over because people had left it.Its important to keep in mind that the function is there to tailor to crashes not leavers P,nosgoth,cx5agir,1,t5_2wx92

Pubstars arent hacking you saying they are just inflates their already inflated ego even more. Every  games me and my teammates get called aimbotters because whiny little babbies like you need to have something to cry about.,nosgoth,czyn0kk,6,t5_2wx92
