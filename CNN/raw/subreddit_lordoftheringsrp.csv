4712295,0,t3_3fh0t2,Haldir Marchwarden of Lorien saw the elf maiden approach the Golden Wood. He was curious albeit cautious. Lorien had seen an elf enter its wood unannounced not long ago with ill intend for Galadriel herself. Nanthirdril was on an important missive in the Greenwood and had left Haldir in defense of the forest.I have important news for you. Hmm then she knows of our presence. I will oblige the maiden. He slid down the thick trunk of the mallorn and approached the stranger.Mae Govanen traveler our Captain is currently abroad and we are under strict orders that none enter the wood. There are hundreds of sentries guarding the perimeter of Lorien and it would be unwise to test their marksmanship however your words are perilous. Please speak but advance no further.m As Nanthirdril is away it will need to be an interaction with Haldir at this point however uAuPhoenix has authority to grant you entrance as well. Welcome!,lordoftheringsrp,ctoiuwk,5,t5_393pp

4762642,0,t1_ctuqtjp,That sounds perfect  for me. Relad responded. When Amrothos began walking away Relad began seeing to his own business then it struck him. His bow! Relad jumped up onto a rolling  wagon filled with orc bodies on their way to the corpse fire and from there he leapt onto the wall and began running towards the southern wall. Once he got there he saw a group of children playing with the polished piece of wood trying to fire arrows but they didnt have the strength to use the weapon built for elves. The children startled by his sudden appearance huddled up behind the oldest one of them. A girl maybe twelve years old who at the time was holding the bow. Oh hi there little friend! Could you give me my bow back please? Relad said in his soft voice. The girl who decided to test the limit said. Of course master elf but only if you shoot an arrow to prove that it is your bow Relad laughed and said why not. If I could get my bow now? the girl gave it to him and then Relad turned to the small boy who was playing with the quiver. Could you give me an arrow maybe? The boy was afraid of the elf to the point that he was mute due to fear the boy silently took an arrow from the quiver his wide eyes never letting go of the elf. Relad took the arrow and in a single motion he drew the bow and fired an arrow that split an apple that the fruit salesman was holding up inspecting for worms or larvae. Relad then yelled from atop the wall It contained worms then laughed and threw a copper coin to the man. Now i must go im sorry but my friend was hurt in the battle and i must see how he is doing the children nodded and the boy gave Relad his quiver Relad took out an arrow gave it to the brave girl and said Keep it Then he began strolling towards the medical tents to check on Havrok. ,lordoftheringsrp,ctuvj8d,3,t5_393pp

9447931,0,t3_59yglf,Gamlin sighed and bowed his head upon reading the note. The funeral notice had just arrived by messenger that morning from Belegost. Kunam had been a well respected smith and had often made dealings with Gamlins late father. He had begun falling ill when Gamlin had set out for Erebor but he had no idea that it would end in death. As he thought of the old dwarf a curious memory came to his head. Long ago he had visited Gamlins father...and had brought along a human child...Yes....Tzur..... he mused to himself before quickly requesting a piece of parchment and a quill from the messenger.Tzur If this letter reaches you I hope it finds you well. I am not sure if you would remember me as we only met once in my late fathers home many years ago. I am Gamlin Stoneclaw cousin to the High King of Belegost and captain of his company. It pains me that I am currently in Rohan and unable to attend his funeral. But rest assured that his legacy shall be kept in our memories and in his craftsmanship. May his strength linger on in you.Although I was yet young when I first met you and your father I am brought back to that time and feel I should share it with you. Your father had shown mine a necklace a small white stone found with you. I am unaware if you have been made known of this but he felt that it may be connected to your people. My father had no idea of its origin at the time but in later years had always felt that it must come from the east possibly Gondor as he had come upon merchants before with similar wares. I hope this information helps you and should you need any of my assistance do not hesitate to ask. As I remain in the east I will remain watchful for other clues of your birth.Your sworn brotherGamlin StoneclawQuickly giving the letter to the messenger Gamlin also withdrew a large coin purse and handed it to him.See that you deliver this to the Blue Mountains as quickly as you can ride. he commanded the wide eyed boy. Deliver it to a man named Tzur Gavoa. He will be in the mountains and may be hard to find. You may not find him at all. If this be the case see that it goes to the hands of his brother Kulam.,lordoftheringsrp,d9dlb0w,1,t5_393pp
9475087,0,t1_d9c054l,Elaina smiled Thanks then ate it silently as Ripley lapped away at his milk. The loaf of bread was probably the most delicious thing in middle earth she tried not to seem greedy when she had ate it all in about four minutes.OOC Sorry bout the delay! I dont really know what city were in... whats the name of the most eastern city in Rohan? If you came from The Mountain then were in the most outer rim.,lordoftheringsrp,d9h0by0,1,t5_393pp

That and using a sword along with hunting. She forced herself to smile at the thought of her younger self running around like the world was out to get her with kittenRipley in tow.,lordoftheringsrp,dcajkma,1,t5_393pp
10346953,0,t1_dce8jze,And you great Elvenking have my cavalry. We start now. I turned towards my captain beckoning him to grab from my horse a wax seal of Rohan. Turning back towards the table a guard stepped forward with the parchment and quill I had ordered to be brought and began to scrawl.Henceforth the area of Rhovanion will be common ground among the races of Dwarves Elves and Men. Within this area will be a free space open to all safe for all. This space shall be known as Ridderwood a high council of the three Kings laying down laws and having the responsibility to maintain a garrison and guard the streets.Once I was done with my writing I had signed below the words adding under my name the seal of Rohan in its wax state. I made the sign of the Hammer similar to the one about my neck and prayed for this to not fall on its face. It is better to have agreements written down no? A seal keeps the document credible.,lordoftheringsrp,dcgvxit,1,t5_393pp
