2842724,0,t3_2s3edf,Responding over here instead of on AskHistorians because Im not being that useful  going off Isabellas report that it says June  at the bottom I thought to check my Petersons Magazine for June  and its definitely not from that. Looked online at Godeys July through December  and I dont think its from that one either as both magazines tend towards frontispiece plates of women and children affecting scenes etc. rather than reproductions of male portraits. Its possibly from Harpers or Scribners was it around in the s?.So more detectively I started looking at my Pinterest boards and noticed that this portrait from Cranach the elders workshop seemed fairly similar in terms of clothing and style. Ive been off looking through portraits by Lucas Cranach the elder and younger and havent found this one specifically but it seems likely to me that this is after a portrait by one of the Cranachs or else another early to mid th century German painter.I agree with Isabella this is a midVictorian magazine print that was probably cut out because he or someone else liked it and then just got kept.,fashionhistory,cnr7rzl,1,t5_2uajt

Even if it doesnt tell me anything about the clothes it may be a good resource for the character herself.The Silverman text sounds good too  thanks for the suggestions! ,fashionhistory,cu7c3e5,1,t5_2uajt
