734866,0,t1_cgnt17c,FL Studio is pretty basic and easy to understand. In my opinion its not the best but its the easiest.I used Cool Edit Pro for a couple years and then once I got Windows  I needed a better software. Adobe bought out Cool Edit and made it Audition so it was fairly simple for me to just hop right in and do my thing. The mixing gets fairly simple on it once you know what youre doing and in my opinion its simple but gets the job done but once I have the money Im going to upgrade to Pro Tools.,TeenMusicians,cgnt3qi,1,t5_2tu4s
