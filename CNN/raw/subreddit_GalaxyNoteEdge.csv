2544080,0,t3_2o6864,I have one and was curious as to if you are using a case with it?  If so which one did you get?  I found one on amazon that is just a back case but its not as good as I had hoped.Overall I think your write up is spot on.  I really enjoy my Edge but it is taking me a bit to get used to it.  When ever I hold mine I feel like I am going to drop it on accident which leads me grip it tighter and boop tapped something on the edge screen.Coming from an iPhone s to this is a huge plus to me.  I really enjoy being able to see the weather on my home screen my appt calendar all without having to tap an app to view.Here is mine.,GalaxyNoteEdge,cmqnci4,1,t5_33hv7
