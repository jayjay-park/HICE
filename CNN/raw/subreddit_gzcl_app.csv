10854613,0,t3_5thj6e,Not sure if its not a functionality or if Im just bad at using it but it would be very important to me to be able to move the workout around in the calendar. Also I think that would be taken care of by moving the workouts in the calendar but If I change my TM it wont automatically affect the workout of the day  I understand how and why it shouldnt affect the previous onesAlso the possibility to add comments to a set or the workout would be great. ,gzcl_app,ddzkrin,1,t5_3emuv
