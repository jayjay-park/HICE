13423,0,t3_1u99zb,. Lack of evidence showing the BoM story is true.  The claims it makes are enormous literally lifechanging.  To believe something like that you really have to have a great reason.  The only evidence that there can be is the spirit.  The same feelings confirm every religion for every believer not good enough.. Loads of evidence that the BoM should not be taken at face value.  Gods most correct holy book is riddled with errors many of which are anachronistic.  Smiths criminal history and penchant for deception his recorded fascination with the native Americans and his access to View of the Hebrews all paint the picture of a manufactured religion.  His perverse sex life doesnt exactly add credibility to his story especially the DampC verse in which God supposedly tells Emma BY NAME to shut up and live with polygamy...  Then on top of all of that theres the BoA the Kinderhook fiasco the witnesses seeing the plates but not really theres not one detail of the story that doesnt detract from its legitimacy.  Its completely farcical when you stand back and see it for what it is..  Gay rights.  I mean come on.  In the wake of the  priesthood revelation to watch the church go through basically the same paroxysm of dullwitted bigotry was just too much.  Gods prophet on Earth my ass..  LDS Inc.  I mean it is a BUINE emphasis on the .  The mall cost more than the total of decades of charity.  Then when you bring it up members say Oh but no tithing was used!  Well a. how do you know because the books are closed? and b. if not directly then where do you think the money for the LDS companies that DID pay for the mall come from?  The church owns dozens and dozens of businesses.  The Methodists dont own any goddamn luxury malls Ill tell you what.  Ridiculous.  And they recruit in the third world the parasites.  Taking old folks money to gas up Packers jet.. The church takes the good things in life and sells them back in exchange for your freedom.  They hold your family hostage by getting the most sentimental and warmhearted members of it zealously invested in the idea that eternity with their loved ones can be theirs in return for obedience and loyalty.

Its a concept created by men who thought their penises were so important that they changed who a woman was. Plain and simple. I got into my current relationship pretty TBM. My boyfriend is atheist. He was very supportive and loving and wanted to be with me even though I wanted to save myself for marriage. After losing my testimony I gave him my virginity. Hes still just as eager to be with me and our relationship is better! Healthier! And so much more fun!  I really feel for these people. Even I never spat out this much regurgitated bullshit as a TBM.

The reality is not everyone is interested in sex or likes it and that doesnt mean they are closet homosexuals or dysfunctional its just normal for them.The prevalence of porn has caused a massive increase in the number of men who are only turned on by a certain body type and who experience insecurity about their sexual performance.Im not antiporn Im a social researcher and the facts are that you are not abnormal or alone there are a lot of men who feel the same as you.,exmormon,cesy6t9,0,t5_2r0gj

191991,0,t3_1wb0ax,Welcome to rexmormon! Youll find a ton of love and acceptance here and this sub can be a huge help in getting you through this crazy transition.It looks like youre still on the fence. As you might guess most of us here would like to nudge you onto our side but you have to decide what is best for yourself. You will get a lot of advice and read a lot of stories but ultimately you need to figure out what you believe and where you stand. Well all do our best to help with that process but remember its up to you.This is going to be long but I thought Id just give you some of my thoughts that have helped me get to the other side of what youre going through right now.gt Im still afraid that Im the one who is wrong and that if the church is actually trueI think all of us here have had this fear at one time or another. I know that I have! Its an extremely valid question because the consequences of your decision could echo through eternity.Lets pretend the Church is absolutely true. If you leave youre essentially damned forever. If you stay youll get to enjoy eternal life with God.On the other hand if the Church isnt true what will happen? If you leave you get to go explore a brandnew world outside of the LDS Church. If you stay well you live a churchfilled life.I personally prefer the liberation I now enjoy from leaving. Seeing the world outside of a Mormon lense is an incredibly refreshing experience! Im an agnostic atheist which is no belief in a god but I dont know that one doesnt exist and abandoning religion altogether has made this life and world all the more precious to me. Each day is special because I get to kick around on this awesome world and have new and fun experiences!gt I feel like Ive been lied to betrayed and played for a fool.Its a terrible feeling isnt it? Take comfort in knowing that youre at least smarter than a lot of us here! You figured it out a full  years before I did. I would give anything to be in your position right now. Look on the bright side! If you end up leaving the Church your life will not have been completely dictated by it. As for me and many of us here we based every single major life decision on our faith in the Church. Just remember how lucky you are to have the extra time that many of us would die for.As for getting over the feelings of betrayal youll find a way to cope. Losing your faith is a major experience and youll most likely go through the  stages of grief. Its natural to be angry. Dont feel bad for coming here and ranting about everything and anything that bugs you if you think it will help. We have a great community here and love hearing all types of stories!As for dealing with your family there are many different approaches. I would recommend staying low while you figure all this out. Youre very new to the idea that the Church isnt what it seems. Continue to investigate this issues privately until you are able to decide one way or the other. Then with a firm conviction on your decision you can reach out to family and friends.Yeah it sucks to hide. I know that all too well. Im currently trapped at BYU pretending to be a believer. It sucks but sometimes its necessary to save relationships or be able to graduate from BYU.Sorry for being a little disjointed. Writing this is just as helpful to me as I hope it is for you. Continue to ask questions. Never take anything anyone says at face value. Investigate all claims then youll find out what you truly believe.Were all here for you!,exmormon,cf0b36t,21,t5_2r0gj

It felt like a dreaded nightmare  was happening for real or something.  It isnt my fault the church doesnt hold up to the data.  dont get into specifics with him Leave the kids out of it for now.  Until you and hubs come to some sort of consensus dont drag them into this.  You have time to open their eyes.  Plus you have google on your side.  No sense waking the dragon at this stage of the game.   Lay  things no more than  things in his lap and say how they make YOU FEEL.  Let him know youd love for those things to get resolved in your mind and if he can help out with it you are all ears.   For the purposes of this conversation since its your husband who is the TBM let me suggest these  trouble areas.  .  Warren Snow the bishop in Manti who castrated the young man who was competing for the charms of a young woman who he bishop Snow wanted for a plural wife.  Brigham Young shrugged it off.    What role did Henry Jacobs play in church history?  He was cuckolded by both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and his wife Zina went on to be the nd Relief Society president.  And he is lied about twice on lds.org where he is accused of abandoning Zina which actually means going on a mission.    Why does the plan of salvation as revealed to ancient prophets in the Book of Mormon and modern prophets until  include this bizarre thing about God changing peoples skin color.  We know it doesnt work that way.  Peoples skin color doesnt change as a reward or punishment from God.  After communicating your concerns leave them alone.  Give hubs space to process this.  Its okay if he thinks youre deceived by Satan for a few months.  This is really common.  My wife totally thought I was deceived by Satan.  Its not your husbands fault that his brain goes there.  Its conditioning.   Sex him up on a regular basis.  Be into it.  Every teaspoon of that special substance you extract from his little factory is like truth serum.  It will enlighten his mind.   Depending on how deeply you guys are in disagreement you might need to backtrack from full on disbeliever that wants to tell the church to fuck off to more of a cultural mormon who attends church because she loves everyone.  Im more of a love one another mormon.  Not a ironrod holding supermormon.  For me its all about love.  If Joseph Smith can literally fuck  of his housemaids and everyone sings songs about how awesome he is then I can forgive Sister Nelson for being a toxic person to her peers and a semiabusive parent.     Now that youre not a believer even if you do slow your roll and still attend church do not fulfill a church calling.  That ship has sailed.  Come up with some excuse to weasel out of it anytime they try to pin you down to a church calling.  I hereby call you poptarteve to the high and holy calling of getting your family out of mormonism and passing naughty notes to your husband to give him unclean and impure thoughts during sacrament meeting.  I do so in the name of his noodly scrumptiousness amen.   All of the above was written with the assumption that you want to stay in this marriage.

245468,0,t3_1wwx7b,This seriously feels like a mirror of my own situation with my wife. We also cant communicate about religion because of exactly the same reasons you stated. I wish she would eve just write me an email about it. The things your wife emailed you seem like exactly what my wife is possibly feeling right now. That being said about the tithing issue try to make it clear that if your wife isnt earning any income she shouldnt feel guilty for not paying. Tithing shouldnt be a shared commandment but an individual one. And if you arent wanting to pay that responsibility doesnt fall on her shoulders. About the other things she wrote you try to communicate how much you respect her feelings and decisions about the church but as livingly as you can say it make it clear how you feel about it. Before she asks you for blessings make it abundantly clear how you feel about giving blessings but then tell her that if she still feels like ever asking you to give her one you will do so. It might be better to respond to her email in an email because it seems to help present your feelings and perspective in a way that will be received with more respect. Then leave it up to her to bring up the subject again when you are together. These are my two cents.  ,exmormon,cf671bl,1,t5_2r0gj

248298,0,t3_1wybtk,I actually suggest something from a post earlier today  use of the phrase fairy tale. Hear me out. Uhueshallnotpass quoted his seminary teacher as saying that a story from the Book of Mormon sounds like a fairy tale. This phrase is rare enough to draw attention but innocent enough to be shrugged off as coincidence if heard by the wrong people. Make a comment in Gospel Doctrine about a fairy tale conversion on your mission. Make a statement to a suspected fellow nonbeliever that you love the new Disney fairytalelike stories. Work it into a conversation and see who bites. And if they actually want to burn you at the stake disavow all knowledge of the phrase and its covert meaning. Call it a coincidence.Anything more is impossible to disavow anything less wont stand out enough.Also just my two cents I expect this will work only rarely. I think our community of nonbelievers while sizable is spread pretty thin dont be disappointed when nobody takes the bait. But if you strongly suspect someone give it a try.Also thanks uhueshallnotpass.,exmormon,cf6hn5l,7,t5_2r0gj

Basically the knowledge or lack there of will not impact weather you get into celestial kingdom.   gtThe First Presidency subsequently concluded that additional debate would be fruitless and so released a letter to all general authorities that concluded with this instruction FPgt    Upon the fundamental doctrines of the Church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the people of the world. Leave Geology Biology Archaeology and Anthropology no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind to scientific research while we magnify our calling in the realm of the Church.gt    We can see no advantage to be gained by a continuation of the discussion to which reference is here made but on the contrary are certain that it would lead to confusion division and misunderstanding if carried further. Upon one thing we should all be able to agree namely that Presidents Joseph F. Smith John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said Adam is the primal parent of our race.My opinion...they knew that doctrine and science would always clash on this even with revelation.

289061,0,t3_1xeui9,Yes this is exposing the church big time. Ive always been bugged how the church knows about the faith destroying doctrinal issues but chooses to stay silent. They let FAIR or FARMS contradict themselves and make the most absurd statements. The leaders would refer you to apologists and make it sound like they have good answers. I didnt care what the apologists had to say what did the leaders the prophets seers and revelators have to say? I soon realized that the prophet would loose big if he had to pick a side of the argument. Its hard to pick which lie would be best to cover another lie. If for example he said he thinks the Book of Mormon is historical hell go on record as being demonstrably wrong. If he says its not historical hell go on the record admitting the leaders before him have been lying the entire time.Now Tom Phillips may succeed in making him pick a side to believe in. Monsons best answer would be to say I dont know and hope the faithful see him as a victim. Either way this will expose more people to the problems of the church than anything Ive seen the reddit exmocommunity do.

An afterlife would mean that we would be reunited and I could touch her see her  hug her and just be with her again. Finally I realized that just because I wanted something to exist does not mean that it does. I created this fantasy in my head because I did not want to cope with the reality that I will never know her or see her again. And I finally came to a point where I wasam okay with that. That was my tipping point where I finally decided that there is no big man in the sky no heaven and no hell. There is only the life we have now.

349323,0,t3_1y39u8,Alcohol can be a tricky thing when youve been taught to fear it your whole life. To be fair their is a fair amount of caution that should be present when you are testing things out. Its common for mormons and exmormons in particular to have the false idea that a sip of alcohol will trigger rampant alcoholism and send you sliding over the precipice of self control into a raging torrent of lust and sin. HOWEVER self control and even a small amount of personal responsibility and thought can shine a more accurate light on alcohol. Alcohol can be dangerous yes. But when used responsibly it can be one more small aspect of your personal and social life that doesnt come with any strings. You either want to drink one night or you dont. There shouldnt be any pressure or expectations to outdrink or impress anyone. If you do decide that you want to explore alcoholic beverages Id suggest doing so in places where experienced individuals would make your drink. Ask for something light and take things one sip at a time. Testing the drinking waters at a party is unwise because the party atmosphere has a way of dulling the mind and helping you inflate your confidence without good reason. If going to a restaurant or bar is an uncomfortable thought or you fear being seen you could invite some good friends over for dinner and drinks. No need to get shitfaced or to act like youve got it all figured out. Select attendees according to their ability to be supportive and helpful. Some personal support may help you get a reasonable gauge on how to try something new that is intimidating but also be helpful in reminding you of your concerns and goals in trying alcohol. Alcohol with food or water is very smart.  it helps to slow and even minimize the effect of the drink so you arent hit with the full force.  You arent sitting there holding this drink and indulging more than you should because of a lack of something else to do. Taking things slow is key to responsible drinking for beginners. Everyone responds to alcohol a bit differently and you should give yourself the time to see how you handle it and if you like the beginning affects of getting a little tipsy for example or just enjoying the taste of a small glass of whatever suits your fancy. ,exmormon,cfgz42l,2,t5_2r0gj

375367,0,t1_cfi4nry,My spouses and my journey out doesnt really support or contradict the other anecdotals you have. He had doubts and problems with the whole thing starting as a child preteen age. I drank it all in until I was about  when I felt quite slighted that men got the priesthood but women couldnt and somehow it was fair. I wanted magical powers too! My magical power replacement of having kids didnt seem at all comparable let alone equal. I got pregnant at  ty abstinence only education compounded with fear and the guy didnt believe me slut shamed me and went on with his life. Being raised the way I was the only option was to find someone who would take me and I did. He played the white knight to my damsel in distress routine. He was and still is as far as I know TBM though very inactive while we were together. I tried all the tricks in the book to get him to go to church and lead the family like I was supposed to so that the relationship would work and wed be happy. I had my doubts but I was clinging to the religion as an all encompassing savior because thats what I was taught and getting pregnant young and not attending college its all I had. By the time that relationship was ending in the early ks the internet had become my research playground and I began to learn. I was inactive and knew I had problems with the whole thing but put on a face for family and most of the men I dated. I had gotten a job to care for my three children but that was hard financially. The truth to women making less than men for the same job hits so hard when youre suddenly the sole breadwinner faced with childcare and in my case for special needs kids after not being in the workplace for  years. Its quite the topsyturvy life for a while. About this time my current spouse and I got together. He was halfheartedly attending a singles ward waiting for his divorce to drag its way through a rd year in delayed court crap. We were never active in any ward though my records followed me wherever I went thanks to my meddling parents. We played our learned roles for our families while he found reddit and other resources as he continued lazily on his way out. I was distracted with parenting duties and so was really just holding on for a time when I could think again. We talked a lot of nights and both knew we wanted out of UT state and the oppression bubble that we felt surrounded by. Four years ago we got out and without the oppression bubble pushing us together we walked different paths for our journey. I was back to being a SAHM so my social structure was limited to support groups for kids with special needs and my kids friends parents. It was not a lot not nearly enough and with my family contacting me at least twice weekly about returning I shut down for a while. My spouse with his new coworkers and getting out every day into the local culture sped up in his journey. Things that he couldnt make sense of with all the cognitive dissonance he was getting answers for one way or another. He decided to remove his name from COLDS records about  months before I did and I distinctly remember that I consulted with him after Id decided to make sure he was okay with it because I was still playing deeply ingrained roles. Wed both talked about it but kept our decisions to ourselves for a while before pulling the trigger and I informed him first.Anyway take from that what you will. Just thought Id add my shade of gray to how both genders leave. ,exmormon,cfjo7ch,1,t5_2r0gj

However in practice this does not happen because people are frequently asses.So laws to require a legal equal treatment are appropriately made and nobodys religious beliefs are being trampled upon. Sure a person whose religious beliefs tell them to hate LGBT people are now legally obligated to sell them goods and services and housing but there was never any constitutional guarantee that you can impose your religious beliefs on the community just that you can hold any beliefs you want.,exmormon,cfp6qq1,1,t5_2r0gj

490767,0,t3_1zpvuw,My internal conflict comes from the way that the LDS church teachings hold me and my family hostage. When I was an active believing Mormon I struggled with any intellectual pursuits especially those that did not directly support the church. The church taught that anything that led me away even if true hindered my ability to spend eternity with my family. This made me feel extremely guilty when my conscience said to support gay rights or read about the true nature of our universe but the church told me that conformance was the only way to ever be happy and avoid separation from those that I loved. I may also suggest watching the I am an ExMormon video series. This one in particular really touched me. She is right when she says that Families Can Be Together Forever is actually a veiled threat. As a man who loves his family nothing was and is more terrifying that losing them. The churchs teachings use my fear and love against me in order to keep me from questioning practices and in order to keep my yearly donations at . Now that I am lessactive the church still stresses that it is more important for my family to attend the ward without me for several hours each week than for us to spend time together as a family. ,exmormon,cfw1xuh,2,t5_2r0gj

A great parallel are college kids who put on the freshman  whether its drinking or eating seemingly the freedom afforded by a meal plan and unsupervised consumption can lead new students to eating in excess. Eventually most of them figure it out and move on others not so much. I think that is what we see here along the lines of if thinking is good over thinking is great Sometimes things are as good as advertised but if you over think it can diminish the value of the experience all together and for no other reason than you thought about it too much Kinda like a prepper or a worst case scenario person sure they might be right but what sort of life results if they arent?,exmormon,cg51wxx,1,t5_2r0gj

I was everything a good mormon girl should be and I only wanted to do what was right however I couldnt understand why my YW leaders never treated me the same as the other girls whose families were in the in crowd who they adored so much and placed in leadership roles totally blind to lessthanhonorable things these girls did outside of church. It breaks my heart to remember how much I wanted to be included as a childteenager and how good my intentions were  I really wanted to add value. As an adult it really upsets me to think about how as a young girl I could have really used some true fellowship during a difficult chapter in my life. It is definitely difficult to be viewed and treated as low hanging fruit especially when your intentions are pure and you could add value to their group if they only gave you a chance. A lot of members of the LDS church would benefit from the wisdom and insight from single mothers widows struggling members...but thats not what theyre interested in.Today Im happy to be out of the church and Im happy to hear that you have too.

Edward died of malaria he contracted.  Edwards death left Emily and her sister orphans.  They were taken into the Smiths mansion to help with the children.  Joseph decided he wanted to marry Emily and made it happen in a very backhanded and secretive way.  After Smiths death Emily was passed over to Brigham Young like so much property.  Young treated her like crap.  If only Emilys father Edward had not joined the cult.  He wouldnt have sold their home and business he wouldnt have moved to Kirkland and contracted malaria.

669718,0,t3_21tmdk,Williams James often referred to as the father of American psychology states that personal religious experience has its root and centre in mystical states of consciousness. I believe a Mormon would call these states of consciousness The Spirit. Interestingly enough these mystical states of consciousness can be found in every major religion Christianity Judaism Islam Buddhism Hinduism. Mormons may be shocked to find they dont have a monopoly on feeling the spirit.In The varieties of religious experience William James lays out four characteristics of this state of consciousness see page . Ineffability  The person feeling the spirit says that it defies expression that no adequate report of its contents can be given in words. It follows from this that its quality must be directly experienced it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. In this peculiarity mystical states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect.. Noetic Quality  mystical states seem to those who experiencethem to be also states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They are illuminations revelations full of significance and importance all inarticulate though they remain...and carry with them a curious sense of authority for aftertime.. Transiency  Mystical states cannot be sustained for long. Except in rare instances half an hour or at most an hour or two seems to be the limit beyond which they fade into the light of common day. Often when faded their quality can but imperfectly be reproduced inmemory.. Passivity  the mystic feels as if his own will were in abeyance andindeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a superior power,exmormon,cgge9lu,10,t5_2r0gj
669730,0,t1_cgg5jic,From my own personal experience what the church says it does with child abuse cases and what it actually does can be completely opposite. They do not always excommunicate the perpetrator nor do they always mark the perps records. Really it depends on the local leaders and how they handle the situation. I know there are cases mine included where victims are shamed into taking the crime no further than telling the bishop often the first person sought for counsel and then the victim is guilted and manipulated further and told they must forgive and forget their abuse and the abuser or they risk disappointing Heavenly Father and not following church council.That is how these people get away with the crimes. I dont know what is behind church leaders not wanting to help victims. Is it just saving the churchs reputation?  Ive spent too long trying to figure it out. My personal experience was unique in that my family moved many times so there were many PH leaders who knew of our situation I even spoke to a GA about it once in his office. Not one of them did a damn thing.  My perpetrator now works in the temple. I did fight several years ago to get the perps record marked...my local leaders treated me like I was the perpetrator ruining this good persons life.

If you cant handle the debt or dont want to take on that debt Im sure plenty of other schools would be happy to take you. You are an ideal transfer candidate.

685360,0,t1_cghhzxb,Heres the thing Ive done this. Ive read Ive prayed Ive gone to church Ive born testimony like I was told a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it.... Ive tried with earnest intent. Ive told hundreds of people that they too can receive an answer regarding the truthfulness of the gospel if they do the same. I was doing all that on faith. I was told that I would eventually know it was true. I never really did but I pushed it out of my mind because I couldnt accept that everything I believed could possibly be wrong. But then one day I realized that I was talking myself into it. I have not ever received an answer from God. I have no evidence that he is there. I was faking it til I made it. I had told myself for so long that I knew it was true that I totally overlooked the fact that I had never received an answer. Ive cried out for comfort and not received anything.I take MASSIVE issue with you saying that this is repeatable because clearly it is not. It is not scientific. It is incredibly subjective and very prone to confirmation bias. Your stance perfectly illustrates the genius in Moronis promise There is not other option that it is true. IF you pray with real intent you will know its true. Didnt receive an answer that it is true? YOU MUST NOT HAVE HAD REAL INTENT keep trying until you have real intent.  THE TEST IS NOT FALSIFIABLE. It is akin to me saying There are purple frogmen that live on the moon. If you focus your eyes at the moon and truly want to see them then they will show them selves to you. and then when you dont see the frogmen i tell you its because you arent focusing hard enough and you dont truly want to see them. ,exmormon,cgi6dc2,1,t5_2r0gj

It could be as simple as your aunt or uncle deciding to let the ward clerk know that youve moved to a different ward district so your records should be transferred over there so that the local YA leaders can harass contact you about going to church. Then you will show as not in the system and the jig will be up. It can happen so many ways. Or it might not happen at all. Anyways best of luck. Cheers.,exmormon,cgnf3ob,1,t5_2r0gj

753631,0,t1_cgpxq88,It doesnt make sense that this particular verse would be talking about unusual bodily discharges or skin diseases because the person afflicted with what this verse is talking about is plainly being directed to a mikvah which for most Jews in OT times is going to mean the equivalent of a small  swimming poolin our terms.  Jews are very concerned with cleanliness in all contexts one of the reasons why they were generally the least afflicted with plagues etc. during much of European history and in no way would a Jew be directed towards washing a clearly diseased and weeping body part in what amounts to a closed body of water that OTHER Jews are going to be usingwhich means the entire adult community at least over the course of a month.  Jews in the OT may not have known about germs and bacteria and viruses but they VERY much knew about contagion though they conceptualized it in ways much different from the ways we know to be true now.  But what they DID understand they took measure against to the ability of their OT means to do so.  You can Google ancient mikvah and see photos of actual ancient mikvaot the plural of mikvah.  Look for yourself at the size and realize that every adult male had to go through that mikvah every week before Shabbat began and every abovemenstrualage female no less than once a month after the cessation of her menstrual period.  The entire community would be using that same water because the inandout plumbing process is more of a technicality than it is an actual replacing of the water.  Jews are not idiots and there is no way that they would consciously pollute that mikvah water with something that THEY would quickly realize might kill the entire community.  ,exmormon,cgpy0g6,4,t5_2r0gj

754937,0,t3_22sy3k,I agree completely and it is one of the issues that confused me for a while when I was young.  The trouble is that many mormons truly believe that intimacy does not exist in a same sex relationship.  My actual plan when I was in High School was to follow the standard Mormon plan for the most part but I would have  gay experience so I could at least say I had seen what it was about and then find a nice mormon girl and marry her so I could at least have some emotional intimacy in my life.  Despite all the flaws in that thinking I was truly convinced that I was only giving up the sex and I valued emotional intimacy far more.  Luckily as I got older I saw the own errors in my thinking and feeling but it never ceased to frighten me as I watch others follow similar paths.  It just surprises me how easy it was to be duped at that age to actually believe that two members of the same sex were incapable of emotional intimacy probably because I hadnt ever met another gay person until I was practically out myself.  I still hear it occasionally from family members that the love of a relationship comes from the woman which is truly offensive to so many wonderful men and women out there.    ,exmormon,cgq3cxg,8,t5_2r0gj

It has very lasting negative effects for people who go that dont vigorously believe in the church.  This missionary just posted on here with a Help me please I need out that illustrates how unbearable and soulcrushing the environment is for someone who knows how messed up and false the church is.Your parents will probably use any tool they can to crowbar you into staying faithful and serving a mission.  Youll most likely lose a lot of privileges while at home but in time they should recognize the reality that youre just not going to serve a mission and theyll begin to feel guilty about their pressure and punishment that would be harming your relationship with them.You should have a sincere sitdown with them and tell them you wont go on a mission and its not honest to serve a mission if you dont believe.

The church and parents did you a great disservice by hearing your doubts and shipping you off anyways.Are you in the US still or are you stuck internationally?My advice?  . Talk to your mission president tell him you do not believe the gospel and want out.  Do so immediately you are obviously very unhappy it is only going to get worse as you are forced to live a lie.  Accept no other solution no praying no waiting you want out and on a plane home ASAP.. College money are their names on the account?  If its a joint account go remove all your money from it as soon as you can.  Take only what is fairly yours for college.  If their name is on the account well you have more of an issue and you should have been more careful but who can anticipate their parents screwing them over?.. Once your college money is safe and you are safe have a frank discussion with your parents do not beat around the bush and tell them how you really feel about all of it.  If you were unable to get money in step  because of them demand it.  Depending on how that goes.  Figure out your housing situation if you get kicked out from their place use a bit of your college money to find an apartmentcrash with non Mormon friends DO NOT live with any TBMs right now you need to distance yourself from the church for awhile..  Figure out your college situation if you still want to go apply around or for the sake of moving onto other things maybe try to start at a small community college and then moveattend college at the university that YOU want.  .  Financial aid I dont know how much you have saved up but Id get working on financial aid paperwork if you need it.And most of all keep in touch with us dont do anything rash once you get the weight of your bogus mission and your parents off your shoulder you will feel great.

You are sinning and so God will not give you an answer.I was completely dedicated and worthy to receive an answer during those years.  And arnt we all sinners?

And the apostles instead of seeking a revelation from Christ to fill the opening left by Judas?  They cast lots!  The Liahona of the BoM smacks of divining rodtype superstition this is somehow okay since Oliver Cowdery was revealed by Joseph Smith to have the gift of the rod later obfuscated in the DampC to say gift of Aaron so its okay to receive Gods revelations by divining rod  The crowning gem is Josephs seer stone translation and revelation which everyone here knows about.Considering Joseph Smith was an emphatic follower of the Masonic tradition post and that he died with a Jupiter medallion on his person for increased luck and good fortune the Prophet gave quite a bit of credence to the occult.

In order for us to accept that he was referring to another animal that he had no name for there would need to be evidence that he used this kind of naming scheme. By evidence I mean some document acknowledging this is what he was doing. The fact is no document exist. Therefore we can dismiss the argument as fallacious. Its insufficient to provide a hypothesis to explain holes in a theory without evidence. Doing so falls into the category of wild speculation.

923043,0,t1_ch92lvl,I feel ya! My TBM wife is repressed for sure. Her TBM associations are plenty which dictates when sex can be had. Needless to say weve been married for nearly a decade now and sex has dwindled to once a month to maybe twice a month. Self abusing myself frequently has become a normal ritual to get off. Blow Jobs used to happen maybe once a quarter and hell I cant remember the last time Ive seen lingerie! I have to see those damn garments before she strips down. You would think that sex would happen on my birthday nope. We havent had sex on holidays in years. I dont push for it because we always end up in a fight. She tells me that Im lucky to get it when I do because most women she knows do it less than that with their husbands. For example my brother has sex with his wife both TBM maybe once every  months. He jacks off a lot and they think he has problems...in the which he thinks he has problems and is convinced as such. So my wife says we could have it once every  months. Thats what starts the fight.

I told them I am still the same person I just wouldnt be LDS anymore. Most of them cried but in time they are now dealing with it better.When you talk to them try to stay calm and explain your reasons without getting angry or confrontational if at all possible. After telling my mother a few of my reasons she didnt want to hear them anymore. Everyone I told about my decision bore their testimonies to me and seemed surprised when it didnt affect me. The difficult thing is Id been on their side of things but they havent been on this side. They all try the same missionary tactics and now I just call them on it. For me I eventually became an atheist and that stopped most of their efforts. They stopped trying to make me define and clarify my beliefs because I could now just say none of the above. lol Anyway not letting myself act angry and trying to stay calm always had a better outcome than the few times that discussions became heated. Usually people are mainly scared because they really believe they are losing you. Some people express fear through anger because it makes them feel more in control even though its not true. My parents went through the anger and crying and testimony sharing but now they just dont talk to me about it but are still part of my life.Good luck!

The initiate would then be anointed on their head.In the the late s or early s this was changed into what I experienced. I wore a shield which was an open sheet or poncho with nothing underneath. There would be a bubbling fountain to the side and the preparer would dip their hands in the water and dab the initiate on the body part as the blessing was pronounced and symbolically wash the body. It sounds like as time passed less and less of the body would be touched. Until it was down to . But even then it could be done differently. I was done in  and should have just had  touches but my guy was old school and was very hands on. I think he missed the old hose days. And gave me a more thorough washing than was standard in .In any case for all of these. Once the washing and anointing was done the prepares would then dress the initiate in the garments.In  they changed it again. Since then the shield is closed up on the sides. And the initiate goes to the washing already wearing the garments. They explicitly call it a symbolic washing. And then basically authorize wearing the garments.

1009408,0,t3_25lkim,My friend just got called to the UK but in a Mandarin speaking mission which is the language he studied in middle and high school.  gtAnother page suggested about two years for fluency in a total immersion scenario. Another source suggested about three years study with immersion as a part of achieving fluency. That same source suggested that the input of the speaker has a great deal to do with fluency as well as skill of native language innate ability and when they first started studying the foreign language. Fluent is a subjective word though. There is no one agreed upon definition of when someone is fluent. You can learn to communicate reasonably well fairly quickly lt year if you are able to practice speaking it with other people and can devote plenty of time to it if youre learning a language that isnt super different from your native language. Itll take longer for a language like Japanese or Arabic where its completely different from English but learning Spanish German Dutch etc. will require far less time. Also its supposed to be much easier to learn a rd language than it is to learn a nd. Apparently once your brain has done it once its easier to do it again. So if you learned a language in high school learning another will likely be less difficult.

The wrongs were redressed by allowing the Mormons to move to Mexico turning the area into a territory sending in the army to quell a supposed uprising arresting their leaders disincorporating their religion and later allowing them to give up a key component of their faith as part of the road to statehood.  ,exmormon,cht49dt,2,t5_2r0gj

It isnt an ordered shunning as a matter of fact when I left my Stake President kinda like the local bishop for catholics told me his door was always open.   The shunning we refer to is social and family.   Many families will turn their backs on members that leave.  This sub is full of people who were kicked out because they left had their parents stop paying for college  or were told they were not welcome around their younger siblings because of the fear they would influence them as well.    Granted these can be extreme and do not happen every time but the fact they happen at all speaks volumes.     On a social level most people who are members tend to have only members as friends.  Fucked up way that we isolated ourselves from the bad influences of outsiders.   Once you leave many of these friends stop socializing with you.   I had a home teacher that I became friends with who just suddenly stopped hanging out with me when I left.

1169366,0,t3_27i9ul,I will not say its illegal but I believe if someone gives you a check for restricted funds the nonprofit has to allot it to that restricted fund. What it looks like the church is doing is considering all funds it receives as part of its annual fund generally unrestricted funds then allots them to restricted funds as they see fit. Since giving is voluntary and open they might be permitted to do this. Before my current job I worked as a principle gifts officer for a major nonprofit that did research and services for a disease. Guidestar and others ranked us less because we spend more on operational cost than services. It wasnt a fair criticism in my opinions because the operation cost was to paid research scientists and equipment. Many of the services were for clinical trials and subsidized medicine. Our executive director wasnt the highest paid official. Doctors and scientists were. Their salaries were high but if you want the best in the field and get published in the medical community you have to compensate. Or else medical schools and hospitals will take themNow point of the example when I solicited funds donors would read the negative reports and demand the money only go to services and treatment.

1256580,0,t3_28gtne,Polygamy makes a certain kind of biological senseIf you have a strong male physically socially or intellectually who is able to through his own success win the affections of and materially support multiple women then it could be argued polygamy would be evolutionarily advantageous.Men can easily reproduce with multiple women in a short time frame and they can have pregnancies overlap. Women are limited to one pregnancy more or less per year and she cannot overlap reproductive partners. So men can have many more children than women.The opportunity polygamy affords the best suited males presumably with the best genes to pass their traits on to the next generation is optimized with polygamy. Many primate species employ this exact pattern of reproduction. The draw back is that there would be reduced variability in the gene pool which could become too specific. So while more people would be better suited to the life strategies that work in the prevailing conditions through polygamy. The gene pool also becomes narrower so that if conditions change it is less likely there will be individuals that are well suited to the new environment.A good example of this could be immunity greater variability gives a greater chance that if a dangerous pathogen comes along there will be individuals in the population who will be immune. If the gene pool is too homogeneous an infectious agent  that infects one individual has a greater chance of infecting all of them which would exacerbate the dangers from a pandemic. Polygamy makes sense in a stable environment to optimize the number of offspring best suited to the environment. ,exmormon,ciazaq0,3,t5_2r0gj

1260278,0,t3_28hx4v,Im just finishing up with part three. Thanks ujohndehlin. Read on for my critique Ive appreciated when you have asked tough questions to believers Bill Reel Givens I really liked the tough questions you threw out to the panel alternative to OW etc.. And of course I appreciate when youve asked tough questions to critics as well. Ever since I read Brian Haless reaction to your interview with Alex Beam I have been pondering and considering your bias and how it relates to your excommunication. I really think that Brian has a point and it was confirmed to me again in this interview with Jeremy. You really didnt challenge him on anything. And additionally you led into questions with little overviews that were just creating an echo chamber. But what did I expect? Are you a reporter? Of course not. But still I find interviews less interesting if critics are going to slide through unchallenged and only believers or apologists are going to get hit hard. I guess I just want everyone to squirm around a bit as they try to answer hard questions. Am I wrong that this has been the pattern in past interviews?And as much as I want the church to strain under the uncomfortable burden of your membershipingoodstanding I really dont blame them for assuming you wanted to leave and thinking you ought to just be excommunicated if youre going to just let Mormon Stories interviews with critics turn into an echo chamber. Let me be clear that I love your work I think Ive listened to every minute of every podcast your work has improved my life and I dont want you to get exed. But the church challenging your standing makes sense to me if youve transitioned to a place that clearly doesnt challenge the quality of sources methodology or logic of a critics points.,exmormon,cibeam6,6,t5_2r0gj

If we have not the truth it ought to be harmed. J. Reuben Clark st Counselor in the st Presidency May    April  .It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what one does not believe. It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if I may so express it that mental lying has produced in society. When man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. Thomas Paine The Age of ReasonMan once surrendering his reason has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous and like a ship without rudder is the sport of every wind.

This combined with other similar interests and good chemistry made my relationship flourish. A year ago I moved in with girlfriend and Ive never been happier  we may get married one day but were taking things slow and on our own timetable. I also just got a new amazing job that I used to only dream about with one of the most respected companies in my field. It took hard work to convince them I was right for the job I was initially hired on as just a temp but I put in the hours and quality that put me above many many other candidates some with significantly more education than me.

One of the  Holland I think personally had to go and shut down mission presidents who were registering dead people as members.The inactivity rate is honestly unbelievable. I would organize every ward list in all my areas and knocked every single door of every member. Conservatively speaking at least  of listed members had no idea who we or the Church were.

1420865,0,t3_2aecpc,I struggled with the idea of the spirit too. I researched other religions not just Christian. Buddhism and Hinduism have their own experiences where they have essentially what is the spirit. They relate it to bliss or inspiration. While meditating I am able to induce a feeling much like the Spirit. Its also called bliss. If you want to recreate the Spirit go into a beautiful cathedral. It is overwhelming and peaceful. The same thing happens with the temple. I notice it more in cathedrals myself as theyre more architecturally beautiful. The mind is very powerful and science understands very little. Our minds can create such feelings within us in response to our situation or environment that we do not understand. The church understands how to induce feelings of the Spirit too. They will create environments and situations that will cause those feelings to spring up in us thus confirming the church as true. ,exmormon,ciudsz0,1,t5_2r0gj

1501467,0,t3_2bdmm8,Maybe youll never like coffee and that is fine but it is definitely an acquired taste. As others have noted Mormons arent really exposed to bitterness as a flavor.

Thats why no one ever invites anyone out for a glass of juice but going out for coffee or a drink is quite normal. Start sweet and go down from there. ,exmormon,cj4hdw6,1,t5_2r0gj
1502564,0,t3_2bdmm8,Coffee is an acquired taste but trust me its worth acquiring. I started with mocha because coffee and chocolate flavor plus some whipped cream is pretty good. Its sweet enough that you dont really get the punch of the bitter flavor of coffee all at once while still giving you some of that flavor. I moved from there to having them take out half of the chocolate in the mocha and adding an extra shot of coffee. Just so that itd be stronger in the coffee flavor and a bit weaker in the chocolate flavor. Then I started drinking drip coffee at workadd a bit of milk and sugar and its great. Thats where Im at now though Ive been gradually decreasing the amount of sugar that I add and experimenting with light roasts  medium roasts  dark roasts personally I prefer medium and light roasts right now but who can say what the future brings.

The reason you want to see a councillor may be a huge affect on how hints to if you are going because you feel depressed over your realization of the church lies then an lds councillor is going to be tough to go to but if it is for something different they might be able to help. There is a lot of things though that they can not objectively help with. If you are gay then they are at best going to recommend that you accept that side of yourself but never get in a relationship with another gay which is still not good advice. I got lucky my problem was with a fetish I have which the first councillor I went to said was entirely evil and the second actually had done some research on in the past and was able to walk through it with me and discuss my hopes and conclude that I was still in ok standing with the church. In the end the best thing I have done was go to a non lds councillor which it did while in college most colleges have a subsidized program where you can see a councillor for  A session.

1518005,0,t3_2bl9h8,There are some really good replies and I would read all of them. My thoughts are that historically there is no clear cut definition in any culture including Mormonism as to what constitutes the perfect family. Divorce rates in Utah are at least if not above the national average usage of medication to treat depression is above the national average as is the consumption of pornography in Utah. A documentary from around  years ago Mother Superior highlighted the prevalence of meth addiction among Mormon housewives in UT cause apparently that will help a lady compete with all the other relief society members on enrichment night. I have known a number of women who married in the temple but had to leave their husbands on account of domestic violence or cheating. I have also known couples who married in the church and are still together because one or both of them left and that improved their relationship. The most important thing you can tell your sister though is that our brains continue to develop until we are around  years of age so making decisions about marriage and family are probably best put off until then regardless of culture or religion. ,exmormon,cj6k4jz,1,t5_2r0gj

1590448,0,t3_2cguxh,For sake of argument Im going to take this article at face value.  gt While earlier studies have already supported this conclusion whats different about our work is that it provides the first solid data that simply cannot be reconciled with multiple ancestral populations... gt Our work provides strong evidence that in general Native Americans are more closely related to each other than to any other existing Asian populations except those that live at the very edge of the Bering Strait This completely invalidates the Book of Mormon as a historical book.  I mean destroys it.  Lets review.. Noahs flood would have killed anyone who occupied the Americas prior to  BC. . The Jaredites supposedly came over around  BC in a year long barge trip fleeing the tower of Babel located in . The Jaredites ALL DIED save two old men. . The Nephites came over around  BC.  They were of Jewish descent.  . The Mulekites came over around  BC.  They all died. Why do they contradict? . This claim now completely contradicts the supported evidence that the Americas were populated from people living at the Bering Strait.   This completely contradicts the idea of a world wide flood of  days.  The populations did not go extinct. .  More contradictions as the migration gap was between some    years ago.  Some  years prior to the Jaradite claim. Furthermore they claimed the Jaredites fled the Babylonian area far west of the Bering strait. .  More contradictions as this argues for a single population theory.  Yet the Book of Mormon has all of those populations dying before the Nephites show up. Everyone should have been Jewish but they arent. .  More Jewish populations that didnt exist but should leave testable remains. TLDR This is one more nail in the Book of Mormons coffin. Not only does this NOT support Jewish DNA but apologists will need to contend with this report to continue to claim that Jews populated the Americas.  Theyll likely do it in the same way theyve been contending with existing DNA studies by suggesting the Jewish DNA was absorbed into native populations.  The gaping hole in that theory is that the belief is countered by the religion.   ,exmormon,cjfnage,4,t5_2r0gj

1614827,0,t3_2cqeso,It took me several years to stop believing that when bad things happened it was punishment for leaving. However a large part of this was also due to the fact that I was suffering from crippling depression since I was young childhood trauma coupled with low serotonin production then piling on years of wondering why God had let me suffer and wondering if I was being punished. Soon after I went to therapy and started taking low doses of Citalopram I found myself able to heal at a nice and easy pace. While I did occasionally worry about what if? instead of spiraling into terror or despair I found I now had the emotional stability to look at the situation rationally and my worries regarding the church lessened more each month.While a part of your mood swings could be your mind trying to deprogram the churchs indoctrination I too often wondered what if? and found myself terrified of being punished in the afterlife though I dont anymore there is also a chance that you might be traumatized or depressed. If you can I would highly recommend you discuss it with your doctor or with a counselor.

1638342,0,t3_2d1n7y,Hard as it is to convince to convince your naked emperor friend that it is his dogma not his clothes that is weighing him down you can proceed as follows.The Corporate Wonks of FAIR have skewed the definition of translate to one of the most arcane allowable according to the denotation of Joseph Smiths time.The claim that it is a revelation and not a translation has many problems. Here is a short list.. Smith was actively studying living languagesand pretending to study dead ones. He wanted to know languages and he studied some and invented others under the guise of knowing them because he was a prophet.. The facsimiles complete with erroneous completion of partial images have been published with the BoA to show off Smiths translation skills and not his revelation skills. The implication in both the visual and linguistic presentation is a literal translation and not revelation. A bold escalation of Smiths skills alas the Rosetta stone. The apologists are trying to undo the ageold assertion that the facsimiles are purported to be translationsa hard sell given their presentation. . The admission about the necessity of having the plates present while JS was staring into his hat which conflicts with the ageold presentation of the official story for the BoM is an attempt to put the translation of the BoM into the same area of question as the BoA. A big mistake on the apologists part because when the BoM goes down so does the religion. The BoA defense is comparable to trying to save a gangrenous limb while preserving the keystone of the religion. He should not link it with the BoM rhetorically. No angel took the plates away they actually printed the facsimiles.. If the BoA were actually a revelation the early church people had a repository for revelations they called it the Book of Commandments and that morphed into the Doctrine and Covenants. Were the BoA considered revelation its content would have been recorded there.. There is no claim in the canon that the BoA is anything but a literal translation from Abraham to Joseph. Pretty hard to argue against the literalness of by his own hand upon papyrus. None of it implies the current party line of catalyst for revelation. And there is no historical evidence to support the catalyst for revelation claim. That is why JR Holland looked so stupid in the documentary when he introduced this idea to the interviewer.. That the work still has incredible insights is irrelevant to the matter at hand. A smoke screen. So is the strikingly similar to ancient shiz that JS didnt have access to. The similarity crap is far from the point. Your friend attempts to deflect the provable factual reality of Ritners well documented essay into his own delusional bubble. None of this is about similarities to anything. Your friend lies to himself from this point forward in the email.. On a pragmatic angle the people who contributed a small fortune for JS to buy the mummies and the papyri definitely needed to get their moneys worth so JS had to cook up something special for them.. In saying the article is right your friend admits reality. In saying but it misses the point your friend retreats to the subjective terrain of belief. And his dance begins. The sentences that follow are the map of his delusion which hinges on equating translation with revelation a literal phenomenon blurring into a purely subjective one.. In saying Joseph was overconfident in his skills as a literal translator your friend admits to the lie in the most honest way that he can. Still the statement constitutes apostasy. Again your man does not seem to realize the implications of going down roads that could discredit the BoM his religions last refuge.. The point is that the actual text doesnt match up. All the dancing your friend does is a pointless tarantella that ends in his own twisted convolution. In the end the facts remain regardless of his mental gyrations.. The corporate wonks assertions that attempt to blur the lines between translation and revelation gradually equating them are the last possible line of defense of the BoA. Of course that is a move from a literal assertion to a highly subjective one because the move from the literal to the subjective that he needs to make still does not change the literal claim at the historical base of the argument. The literal claims in Mormonism are the only special thing the Mormons have and as apologists attempt to slide them into the abyss of subjectivity they lose their religious identity. People pay literal cash to create the corporate bottom line. Your friend attempts to preserve the crumbling religious facade that brings in the bucks.Indeed apologists may be laying the foundation to change the claim of the BoM translation to revelation that is from the literal to the subjective. And when they do that it is game over. So I genuinely wish them well in that endeavor.Finally that your friends final potshot forged vs. corrected is the last revelation of his delusion. When an obvious forgery can be viewed as a correction and not the forgery that it is there is the split with reality your friend has. It is not a gap that can be mended with logic proof and external scrutiny. Cute that he gives himself an out by saying Joseph would have thoughtthat distances him from Smith and puts him within view of reality safely away from the question of why JS would forge anything. Would he buy a painting of the Mona Lisa for  million if the painter had corrected it and given her crossed eyes?Alas you cannot correct the forgery of the apologists delusion. He has encased himself inside the refuge of revelation safely away from any reality that may conflict with his worldview. Once he has decided that translation equates to revelation nothing you say can pop the bubble of his revelation not even quoting his own words back to him.The real sealing power in Mormonism is the absolute linkage of a person to his delusion one that caters to his elitism and his fear of death and tells him instead that he is a God in embryo.Edited for clarification and skewed numbering that is different from what was in my text.,exmormon,cjloen6,3,t5_2r0gj

I feel like all I am to my dad is a feather in his cap that has fallen in the mud. To him my making it to eternity is not as much about my own personal happiness as it is about the glory he will feel having all his kids stay righteous. I suspect it is the same with your father. Understand that the root of your dads problem starts with himself not you. Distance yourself from the negativity and abusive bullshit and dont engage. If he matures up and makes the first move towards reconciliation then give him a chance but at soon as it becomes abusive again express what hes done wrong and then disengage once more from the relationship.  Eventually hopefully he will learn some boundaries and your relationship will improve but who knows Im an online stranger not a therapist.,exmormon,cjmm8jw,21,t5_2r0gj
1647842,0,t3_2d6k4w,My last summer before college I was in charge of a Stake Camporee for our scouts. The leaders wanted the young men to be in charge so I got chosen that year to run all the meetings during the run up to camp. One meeting early on in the planning was basically a status meeting and was over in about  minutes. But I made the mistake of asking if anyone else had anything to bring up. An adult raised his hand I called on him and he proceeded to take about  minutes to drone on about the importance of the scouting movement to the church and the young men. I have no idea if he was a HC or ward guy or stake guy or what. I just know he sat there and left me standing uncomfortably at the lectern for  minutes because he was an ass and I was an yearold who wouldnt talk back to an adult.Funny thing was that after the meeting was actually over most of the other scouts told me what a jerk that guy was being.  ,exmormon,cjmvh47,2,t5_2r0gj

1656435,0,t3_2dbokv,Well I think I can top your story with my paradoxical situation.  I am  years old I am gay and mostly atheist maybe agnostically atheist and I have chosen to live with my TBM wife who also has used the Lds Church as a big help in her life from being an outofcontrol  and  year old woman to having some balance in her life.  We have been married  years and I only came out gay last year when I separated almost divorced her and then after being in the suicide ward having been rejected by my gay lover who I proposed to as seriously as I could since gay marriage became legal in Washington state the previous autumn and Im back with my wife.  I resigned from the Church because I had so much pain growing up gay and Mormon.  I believe very strongly that the Church is bad for gays for many women and for many men but I cannot deny that it helped my wife.  I had hopes that I could change the Church from within I held bishopric callings stake high councilman callings and every other calling for men and tried to make small changes to help improve the church to take it out of the darkness of misogyny and patriarchy and homophobia but in the end I drove myself crazy and into depression.  Each day is difficult like tonight when I cant sleep because my wife just doubted that we could have a meaningful relationship now after I reached out TO HER COUSIN who came out gay at age  and who is being loved under set conditions by her TBM family of  siblings and staunchly conservative parents.  My TBM wife couldnt reach out to her own cousin she could only judge her as being selfish for leaving her  year marriage to a man that she had no emotional attachment to becuase her bishop told her at BYUi when it was Ricks College that she must marry within a year or her repentance from her lesbian affair would not be complete.  Her lesbian lover did the same thing married had kids and went into depression and then tried to commit suicide all for living the LDS life.  I was in the suicide ward too.

My dad is very much a product of those times and I remember being shocked when I had a Jr High health class assignment to talk to my parents about things like how theyd feel about me dating someone of a different race or religion. They didnt like either one which bothered me but especially the race part. They said it wasnt so much that they wouldnt approve but that it would be too difficult to deal with the rest of societys disapproval. They knew a girl who dated a black guy at Ricks and apparently they got crap from people. But isnt being a Mormon supposed to be all about standing up to persecution and putting whats right ahead of what the world thinks? It always bothered me that theyd fall back on were not racists but other people are as an excuse. I wish I would have pushed back more on that one instead of just being confused and trying to understand them believing they must be right even if I didnt understand it.

I would eye it with skepticism still but if proven and verified independently it would be difficult to dispute at that point.However the BofM being true does not automatically follow that the Brighamite branch of the modern Church is true.  If the BofM was proved to be objectively historically accurate at least in part... it was one guys choppy editorialized retelling of an entire peoples history after all then all that might mean is that we were wrong about Joseph Smith.  Fact is JS did have a lot of opposition and a lot of people with incentive to try and discredit him.  If we accepted this hypothetical it would be difficult to deny him.Basically... at best if the BofM was actually true it would mean that RLDS Community of Christ was actually the true church and all of COLDS were the unwitting apostates duped into going west by a racist perverted madman.,exmormon,cjr0o7i,3,t5_2r0gj

1707359,0,t1_cjtm90y,Its key to distinguish depression from guilt from chemical depression. Guilt is a selfreinforcing problem and interfering will only make it worse. OP if this is the case the only thing you can do is to tell him and Im not suggesting the formal haveaseatson kind of talk because if you remember from your own childhood thats awkward for everyone and terrifying for him that its normal for kids to experiment and figure things out for themselves and that youre there if hes got any questions. Pressing the issue will only make him feel more ashamed and make any guilt he has worse and lets be frank religious or not shame about sexuality is pretty ubiquitous and its something everyone has to come to terms with on their own. Porn is not going to ruin his future relationships. If it did there would be very few people who ever had relationships.If hes depressed there will be other signs. You say hes starting activities that shows he has interests and energy. If hes depressed he probably wouldnt be doing these things. Look to see if he loses energy has abnormal sleep patterns or stops showing interest in things he previously had interest in these can all be signs of depression they can also all be signs of being a teenager.

It was my current wife that I didnt participate in her setting apart to be Relief Society President.My current wife and I met through my Landlady. I wasstill am living in a basement apartment of a nice LDS couple. They are empty nesters. My wife and my landlady were co workers. My wife decided to take out her endownments because she was  and thats just what you do. My landlady went to the session and claims she recieved inspiration for us to be together. Later my landlady came to me and asked me if I was ready to date and that she had the perfect girl for me that had just been through the temple blah blah blah. I really didnt want to have anything to do with a mormon girl but I told her I would take her number and call her. I called her and we hit it off. I was very straightforward from the beginning about my beliefs.The way she tells it she was relieved to have someone to talk to that was honest and that shared a lot of the same questions that she had. She is a redditor maybe I will have her come on here and tell her side of it. She is sleeping now but maybe tomorrow. She is not originally from Utah her family moved a lot due to being a military family. She was used to being the only Mormon in her school. She decided to go to BYUI and was excited to be around people that shared her beliefs or so she thought. It was a nightmare for her some of the stories she tells about her roommates are hilarious and sad.After we had been dating for about  months she asked to be released from her relief society president calling and stopped going to church.,exmormon,cjvdini,1,t5_2r0gj

1733217,0,t3_2eaial,My rd weekend at BYU I went to an offcampus party with drinking and smoking. I saw several BYU kids there including one girl from my ward. We tried not to look each other in the eye.The next day I dragged myself to AM church only to see this sister give a heartfelt talk on the WoW. She acted so Molly on campus but was a wild child on the weekends. She ended up getting pregnant and I never saw her after that.Also in my BYU oncampus ward One girl got pregnant and was sent home. She didnt give up the father so he got to stay even though the most cursory investigation would have been needed to figure out who the father was. One girl was regularly having sex with her boyfriend in Helaman Halls. He left to go on a mission and she was waiting for him to come back and marry her as he was her first sexual partner. He dumped her about  weeks in and she cried for a solid month. My roommate had sex with a girl he just met on my then girlfriends rear bumper. We were shocked and greatly amused. He was interesting. BYU Freshman at  and he bought beer and kept it in Helaman Halls. He explained it was legal for him to own not against the lease at the time and that he didnt drink which was a lie. The RM gave a nervous laugh consulted with the house Mom but they couldnt make him get rid of it using social pressure. He would just look at them like they were stupid. There was at least one weekend marriage in our ward where a couple went to Vegas got married had sex like rabbits all weekend and then had it annulled. They were sent home and we had a special Sunday Schoolcombined priesthoodRS warning not to do that sacredness of marriage etc. There may have been another couple that did it but didnt tell so they didnt get sent home Several guys and girls just disappeared and we never saw them again. Some might have been homesick but many times the HCO was involved so...Basically I knew that at least  of the kids in our BYU ward had sex while attending BYU.

This would be a socialgettingtoknowyou chat that would be exactly the same as if I were taking over a nonsexual pal that my TBM mom had never met before.From that point forward it is just socializing at moms house or in mominclusive activities visiting relatives etc..As evening came on all of the nights me and nevermo GF would go back to OUR room at the motelhotel.This is the way nomo adults do it in the real world when there are similar issues interracial problems for some parents......whatever that make overnight stays with parents awkward.P.S.  Do not tell your mom about the reservations until after they are made.  When they ARE made then tell her that you and GF will be staying at soandso motelhotel so your mom doesnt have to get ready for overnight guests.

1775056,0,t1_ck2vd5a,John Taylor stated that the atonement covers original sin only. The Christian message of forgiveness is expressed in Ephesians gt For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Not of works lest any man should boast.Mormonism discounts this idea and is a bastardization of the original. Works are a fundamental requirement for everything. The work required to gain repentance is sisyphian. It is depressing that with one slip and you will be back where you started. All previous sins pile back on per DampC  gt . And now verily I say unto you I the Lord will not lay any sin to your charge go your ways and sin no more but unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return saith the Lord your God.Perfection is required in mormonism whereas Christians at least in theory accept that humans are by definition imperfect. They rely on grace for forgiveness and salvation.As a disclaimer I am not a Christian. For me the godhuman hybrid simply takes over the scapegoat myth. It does not logically follow even assuming that there is a god in the universe that hesheit would want to manifest itself in human form.,exmormon,ck2wfqi,84,t5_2r0gj

Being very very close and involved in his nephews and nieces lives his  y.o. nephew requested that he participate in his baptism. We were still identifying as mormons and living LDS standards but werent attending regularly. We live in a different state as well. We received an email later that night from his sister the nephews mother stating that if he wanted to participate he would need to bring a letter from our bishop to verify his worthiness. I think she knew we hadnt been attending regularly since moving. I thought that the formality of the request was very cold and judgey while overlooking what an integral part of her sons life my husband had been.

1825894,0,t3_2fgw2i,Hey now It may be a church full of strange thought but the people with those thoughts were either born into itin which case it is the thought that is strange not the people.or they are converted into it. This is where I think we can say the people have to have a certain amount of disordered thinking to accept the strangeness that is mormon doctrine and culture. Those of us who have left came to our own conclusions after learning to think for ourselves that the doctrines were racist sexist homophobic and completely ridiculous. Then later we may have found them to be verifiably false. It takes some time to see these things when you are born and raised into it. The best example I can give you that explains it is this  I was married to an Austrian man. When he was a kid his mother and the culture around him told him that raw cookie dough and cake batter had worms in it that magically disappeared when it was cooked and that ice cream would harm babies. They must have only whipped cream until they were six at which time they could have ice cream. Now of course we understand that these premises are completely ridiculous. But even as an adult my ex husband fervently believed these things. I wasnt raised to believe these things so they seemed completely stupid to me. It is all in how you are raised and taught from an early age. Give the mormons a break. They believe in completely asinine things but many of them are on a path to the truth and to a reasonable existence.

I bet you could confound him with the CES Letter or by asking him what the gift of Aaron is. He is a salesman trained to sell people on his religion. He will attempt to use emotional manipulation to get you to answer questions the way he wants you to then try to sell you that it is the holy ghost possessing you testifying of the truth. He has already used your common heritage to bond with you and got you to agree to let them back and talk about God. I wonder how long it will take them to talk up Jesus or the COLDS once they do come back. You felt unsettled because he got you to agree with him and now you are questioning what you really know.Was he a Lamanite with Middle Eastern DNA too? Are you?Seriously though it took me almost  years to stop having feelings of doubt and that it might be true. The indoctrination runs deep. I would research issues to death past basic satisfaction chasing the sources and verifying the sources and content.As few as a couple years ago I was shaken by a blog that claimed to have DNA proof of the Lehites in the Americas during BoM times. The blog stated things with such authority and seeming knowledge and it was really well put together. It seemed to be a good source. As I read I had a horrible feeling of dread that I was wrong and that the BoM was true. It was a shook me to the core moment. Then I began to check the blogs sources and educate myself about DNA the referenced studies and even more DNA studies DNA science and evidence.It turns out that the blog was totally incorrect cherrypicking sources misquoting scientists and falsely interpreting data and study results to support his hypothesis. There was even some flatout lying about certain findings and scientists findings. The studies he referenced actually further disproved the BoM because the timeframe of the DNA was over  years too early for BoM times. Furthermore the DNA haplotype the blog author referenced was well known well documented and not indicative of Middle Eastern or Jewish DNA from anywhere close to  B.C.E.After I resolved that issue I realized that even if that one thing had been a match or even a close match it would not have made any of the hundreds if not thousands of other problems with the BoM and Mormonism go away.Since then I have become far more skeptical of BoM and Mormonism truth claims because I know it is a fraud.Go back and read the post about the Anton Manuscript sources and ask yourself if Reformed Egyptian ever existed.

Its easy for annonymous people on the internet who are detatched from the situation to tell you what you should or shouldnt do.

A lot of the angst and pain that I see on these boards is from people who come out quickly with raw emotions which leads to hurt feelings. If you take the time to understand your own emotions you can more readily deal with the raw emotions of others. Also when you understand your own emotions you are less prone to manipulation.

Well my testimony only continued to erode. After I graduated the recession hit and I lost my job and was in danger of losing my apartment. I continued to pay my tithing until at last things got so dire that I just couldnt.  It was pay tithing or have my utilities cut off. I didnt pay my tithing.Some friends anonymously im still not sure who did it slipped me some money in an envelope to help me cover my bills. A blessing from God? No I didnt pay tithing. Just good people.Then I got offered a job. I founded a company and now am in the best financial shape of my life. I testify that tithing is a waste of your money and can keep you locked in a desperate position. I bear solemn witness that not paying tithing using your money to pay your bills invest in your future and even sometimes to enjoy yourself is fucking common sense.

Just because you cant explain how something could be faked doesnt mean it couldnt have been faked. The whole point of any halfway decent magic show is that youre seeing something that couldnt possibly be real but also seemingly couldnt possibly be fake. Its the same thing for con jobs. Conmen could never successfully pull off jobs if they didnt cover their tracks. And the Book of Mormon is a longrunning con job that TSCC is still running. They dont want you to think its possible for it to be a con so they set up a whole false narrative to support the bullshit uneducated farm boy who wrote an entire complex book with hidden hebraisms in just a few short months all by himself.

1975825,0,t1_ckr6uzu,Yes you make fair points. I would hope that given that receding hairlines at a young age being common in the males in her family that she wouldnt be so vain as to expect a full head of hair if she is to find a partner in his thirties or forties. Honestly I didnt care about that as an issue when I was single and a younger adult. I also have dated men who were shorter than the national average. Im actually taller than the national average for women though not as tall as my sil. I think its pretty reasonable to expect any man that is still single in her age bracket has been working on an advanced degree and given that our home town is so small and Im not sure if theres many doctorate programs at the local university I think its unlikely that shed find this sort. Divorcees and single parents are what shes likely to find within Mormonism. She is physically very fit and is a runner but shes not exactly lithe. She lost a lot of the weight gained on her mission but it plateaued and shes around maybe thirty pounds overweight. She is still very pretty I think. To be totally blunt given that studies have reflected that  of men in the general populace has masturbated I think its totally reasonable to expect that basically the asexuals and a very small percentage of others have not broken the Law of Chastity. Women pegged in at around  having said theyve masturbated so the odds are decent that very few people of either sex do actually keep the Law of Chastity in general given that masturbation is only one aspect of sexuality. That is what makes the direction so insidious is that its basically fighting against human behavioral norms. Most people are either going to end up hating themselves or basically logically ignoring the notion that theres something impure about human sexuality.Delaying childbirth also increases risks for both mother and child if she does get pregnant. The women who have delayed childbirth in her family dont seem to have typically suffered from infertility issues though her mother stopped conceiving in her late thirties. She wanted more children. Delayed pregnancy also increases the odds of twins. Physically a female is generally at her ideal point of childbearing in her early to mid twenties for risks and fertility. Her worldview may still be too wrapped in Mormonism but I still hope that she gets out because I think it has been harmful to her particularly during her BYU days. ,exmormon,ckrac0a,1,t5_2r0gj

Plural marriage was probably invented in retrospect to explain away affairs... and it worked... so JS probably convinced himself it probably really WAS an order from on high. t wasnt his penis talking it was god! Certainly no god was punishing him for it. When such a risk works once theres an adrenalin rush to see how far you can take it.I think a lot of myths and superstitions start this way... the most virulent ones catch on. There are several guys alive today who claim to be the reincnation of Christ and have thousands of followers.

Both are measures of wealth so why not calculate both? income to  income  from not paying tithing netgross depending on how you paid tithing is an .repeating increase   . If you spent money on activities during a year this  increases slightly  as a rough guesstimate but depends on financial situation and whether or not you sent your children if any to camps youth conferences EFY etc.. Then you factor in how much you spent through extraneous donations like fast offerings but these can vary quite a lot even more wise because fast offering amounts and income amounts vary so greatly. So  increase  how much you would typically spend in a year of your income on extra donationsofferingsprograms.If you spend  hours a week on church  hour block and correlated activities assuming you were quite active and going to activitiesmeetingssupporting the youth adding  hours also factoring out conference weeks in final calculation there are  plus conferences  total for general if you view all sessions twice a year plus  for the two stake conferences plus going to the temple at least once a month  hours based on visit and commute length. In short  to        to   Anywhere from  hours to  hours a year based on these estimates of an active member. This means you save about . to  with generous rounding actual values are . repeating and . whole days worth of time per year. Thats upwards of  weeks of timeoff in a year. This also doesnt factor in prayers time spent worrying and the solid year bullet of a mission dodged if you left early enough like me. income from just tithing plus saving on extra offeringsprograms and anywhere from  hours  weeks of your precious time saved  of your whole year.If I was to do this based on a set income say  thousand a year this is a welldeveloped American suburbia of a hyper TBM pays for their children which I would feel sorry for and would use  for the example to go to everything and spends upwards of  hours a week on church activities I would need to do a bit of research about average costs and budgets of church activities fast offerings and the like most of which is unlikely to be released to the public especially for a calculation for this purpose though it would amount to a more accurateinformative calculation.

Even so I think there is a range of possibilities for those who read the essays and absorb the information minus the positive spin and omissions Our prophet was deeply troubled by polygamy. He only entered into the principle when his very life was threatened. Yeah right. Our prophet liked to fuck when he wasnt on duty as prophet. Thats okay he was fucking as a man not a prophet. Im sticking with mormonism. Our prophet liked to fuck when he wasnt on duty as prophet. Thats not okay. Im sticking with mormonism despite his flaws for a variety of unrelated reasons. Or if the coin falls the other way...Im quitting mormonism. Yay! Hey this tips the balance for me. It shows conclusively our religion was founded on a con. The con includes every facet and is embedded at every level. The founder began as a grifter and learned his lessons well. From there he took advantage of the flock in every way possible including sexual advantage of the women who would say yes. Im quitting mormonism.Its a range of possibilities.

I really dont think the Monson or most of the top  currently have the mental capacity ingenuity and understanding to develop this kind of strategy.  As with Ezra Taft Benson in his years at the top someone behind the prophet is pulling the strings.  Likely a younger apostle but could be in conjunction with people from the presiding bishopric or powerful PR folks or someone else operating from the shadows. I am guessing that there are even power games going on occasionally which is why theres the conflict between talks that say theres room for everyone and actions that clearly show that isnt true. ,exmormon,cli4eqi,3,t5_2r0gj

2218939,0,t3_2khmy1,As a man this only recently struck me  that the whitewashing of polygamy resulted in the erasing of many women from history! Think of what Joseph and Brighams wives sacrificed many of them even worse than Emma. What did they get in return?  years or more of being left out of Mormon history. When telling the story of Josephs life or having a year manual on his teachings no wife except Emma even gets a single line in a chronology. Its worse than hiding things from me  these women are not only forgotten theyve been erased. Because the Mormon church is ashamed of these who sacrificed more than the vaunted boys at Sweetwater not that their sacrifice was meaningless but they did not give up so much of themselves as these women.The church should be ashamed at what Joseph and Brigham and so many other men did. But it isnt. Instead it is ashamed of the women who gave up so much of themselves in devotion to the cause they believed in. The con men and misogynists are praised while their victims are washed over so as not to mar the perfect image the church has created of these terrible men.,exmormon,cllvpch,3,t5_2r0gj

At the same time I would not like to see them attend LDS church services because that has become an authoritarian society rather than a purely religious one.  Indeed it is the hardass authoritarianism now ubiquitous in Mormonism that turned my own children off to that particular denomination.The Follow the Prophet primary song had not been a part of my upbringing but it was with my kids.

2247964,0,t3_2kwjuy,One of the unfortunate side effects of the church is that good people give credit to the church for their goodness. When I spoke with my mother about my disbelief she started listing all the amazing principles virtues and lessons that the church instilled in me I am pretty amazing. I reflected on every one of these virtues and was able able to say to her No mom you instilled them in me. You were wise and thoughtful enough to pick the good principles within the church and disregard the others. It was a profound experience to be able to give that credit back to my mom where it belonged. I just finished building a shed. I could give the credit to Home Depot but in reality I understood what materials were important and what materials were worthless to me or irrelevant. In the church members have the ability to pick and choose sooooo many principles to embrace. If you or members you know are good people its because they picked the right ones its indisputable that there are some really bad and harmful principles too. Its you its your moral barometer its your goodness that is making you feel happy and fulfilled. Take credit for it. I would also encourage to you consider that by leaving the church you open up your selection of good principles and virtues and lessons even wider there are so many more to choose from outside the church. It is the reason why you see so many comments on this thread about feeling more moral and more fulfilled after leaving the church. Dont limit yourself. You are good you recognize good go out and get more of it. ,exmormon,clpkhux,8,t5_2r0gj

2428526,0,t3_2n8o39,Not a Mormon but this is something at the core of the Christian faith too. Ill explain it the way Ive understood it. If you sin then you must die. God a perfect loving being cannot accept you into his presence as you are tainted by your imperfection. Its as if you are balancing on a tall thin rod. Any amount you stray from center will push you over. Its along the same lines that you cant even look at God and live  your sin rejects you from his presence. This is the result of the fall from Eden. To forgive one who has sinned without redemption would be the same as God simply allowing sin which is paradoxical to the existence of a perfect God. God doesnt want this. He created you he loves you as if you were the only one to love. The only way that the sin of the world hundreds of billions of people throughout history could be forgiven was if someone else who didnt deserve to die paid that price instead. The only one who didnt deserve this was God himself. I wont try to make you wrap your head around the Trinity as understood by nonMormon Christians but it is important to know that Christ and the Father are the same being and Christ is therefore perfect Himself . And that God loves Christ in the same way with the same depth that he loves each of us. So when Christ died it was as if God was trading Christ for us. A being who did not deserve it die was put to death canceling out our own sin. When Christ called out Why have you forsaken me? it was because the Father This is why its said that when God sees us he only sees the perfection of Christ. We still sin it still pains God to see us turn from him by doing so but justice was served long ago  that is what redeems you in the sight of God. ,exmormon,cmbvfl0,1,t5_2r0gj

Its just an extra level of requirement but since the emphasis is placed on Families are Forevertm I feel that mormonism deserves an extra level of scrutiny.,exmormon,cmhzv0i,6,t5_2r0gj

That is not part of the offical instructions on what they are supposed to do But LDS leaders like to inform your family on pretty much anything.Your parents records will be updated to reflect that you are no longer a member This just means your member record number will be removed. However the ward where your parents records are kept will be asked to print new records. Not all Clerks bother to report the change So the record change may go unnoticed.The Bishop will ask to speak to you once he gets your request for name removal You dont actually have to speak to him.

If what both of you are really looking for is just a shared sense of community and belonging and good feelings you can find all of that in other churches and probably a more genuine version of it too.

2542082,0,t1_cmqdx8a,ampampampSection . Seeking versus liking of article  Dopamine sfw gtKent Berridge and other researchers have argued for a distinction between reward which is defined in terms of motivation and pleasure which is defined in terms of emotional expression. A simpler way of describing this is as a distinction between seeking and liking. Seeking occurs when an animal given access to some stimulus such as food executes some type of active behavior in order to acquire it. Liking occurs when an animal shows expressions of happiness or satisfaction while consuming something. There is considerable evidence that the dopamine system is part of the brain system that mediates seeking but not part of the system that mediates liking. Drugs that increase the effects of dopamine most notably stimulants such as methamphetamine or cocaine produce corresponding increases in seeking behaviors but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure. Conversely opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of pleasure but do not greatly alter seeking behaviors. Animals in which the VTA dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food and will starve to death if left to themselves but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show facial expressions indicative of pleasure. gtInteresting Dopamine agonist | Dopamine betamonooxygenase | Dopamine antagonist | Dopamine releasing agent Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmqdya oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmqdya.

2576523,0,t3_2pami0,I found this book interesting different perspectiveThe problem for the early church is that Jesus did not fit any of the messianic paradigms offered in the Hebrew Bible  nor did he fulfill a single requirement expected of the messiah. Jesus spoke about the end of days but it did not come to pass not even after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and defiled Gods Temple. He promised that God would liberate the Jews from bondage but God did no such thing. He vowed that the twelve tribes of Israel would be reconstituted and the nation restored instead the Romans expropriated the Promised Land slaughtered its inhabitants and exiled the survivors. The Kingdom of God that Jesus predicted never arrived  the new world order he described never took shape. According to the standards of the Jewish religion and the Hebrew Scriptures Jesus was as successful in his messianic aspirations as any of the other wouldbe messiahs.Aslan Reza .

2599011,0,t3_2pllax,Im more interested in the interpretation of this story from Jewish Rabbis because  Judaism encourages questioning the interpretation and  Jews are more likely to interpret the story at face value. What I mean by that is Christians have woven in a narrative that Abraham sacrificing Isaac is symbolic of God sacrificing Jesus. Jews obviously dont see it that way.Many Rabbis believe it was a test of Abrahams faith. But many believe it was a test of Isaacs faith. Some claim that it was God forcing Abraham to repent for his maltreatment of his other son Ishmael. While others say the original Hebrew root word used was sacrifice not slaughter and Abraham never intended to actually kill his son but the binding of Isaac was symbolic of him promising everything he had and loved to God. My favorite interpretation is that child sacrifice was common among Semitic tribes at the time in the area and that Abraham was woefully paying his dues after finally having a son. And angel stopping Abraham would have been symbolic of God telling the Jews that child sacrifice was wrong and they should put an end to it.,exmormon,cmxtt73,23,t5_2r0gj
2599526,0,t1_cmxlkv9,Yes you get to pick out your own cool this is your responsibility and sadly many fail to accomplish this outfit and hit people. That is necessarily going to be more fun.

On another note Im sure I cant be the only one that in hindsight finds the Temple to be deeply strange in hindsight in a way that would generally be very unflattering to the Church.

2607340,0,t3_2ppk1j,I actually have a lot of regrets for targeting people who need the gospel when I was on my mission.  By this I mean people who outwardly appear to be down on their luck whether its because they have very little money because of a death in the family because they dont fit in socially etc.  Im sure its not uncommon but our mission president actively encouraged us to work in lower income areas.  People down for one reason or another are easy targets and the truth is they seldom help the community other than to add a number to the stats.  You would think a group with any foresight would actively train their sales force to focus on people who can contribute more to the organization.  That sounds cold but sales is a cold business and so is missionary work.gt Once you go through the temple I bet youll change your mind.Im not so sure about this.  Most people actually find the Temple edifying.  For starters theyre now in a more elite portion of members of the church.  They also typically have a framework of very converted members around them on their first trip which despite to kooky content makes for an enjoyable experience.  The strong members know all the pitfalls and explain away any of the really crazy stuff pretty effectively  theyve done it many times before.I feel bad for the girl youre talking about but the church is absolutely full of people just like her.  Ward Councils talk about them all the time home and visiting teachers serve them almost  but not completely  without complaint.

2701997,0,t3_2r06fy,My husband and I left the church last February and took our kids out with us. My husband was out before me and he did a few things that helped me to want to know. He would raise the subject but not push me just that he really wished he could talk to me about his concerns. He asked if he could buy a copy of BH Roberts book about trying to reconcile his belief in the book of mormon with the evidence. I couldnt say no to a book by an apostle and then I started reading it too. It didnt hurt that it was the only book left in the  bathroom I was incredibly depressed and the cognitive dissonance was so strong that he had to go really slow. I really would have preferred to die than to lose my testimony and started seeing an LDS therapist. She recommended that I get on an antidepressant and I did and it REALLY helped stabilize me. Then I was in a position where I could really think about the concerns DH had and then I looked closely at the things on my shelf. I had just finished a masters in special education and taken a lot of behavior analysis classes and studying how conditioning works and the biological mechanisms that create emotions...I finally accepted that I am an atheist and we were out. As far as understanding spiritual experiences this video by Derren Brown cleared it all up for me. I had a really clear mindblowing confirmation that I should join the church at  years old and it was so hard to understand how that moment that changed my life could have been something other than a message from a personal God who really wanted me to join his true church. ,exmormon,cnb7gbc,13,t5_2r0gj

2709026,0,t3_2r2wbb,I would have to repeat Bryces sentiment.I was a convert for a while and during my time in the church I had a few people that I could get along with really well. Like really well.When I wanted out I thought about whether I should stay in for the sake of keeping the social contact and perhaps seeing where my friendships and relationships go within the church.But the longer I stayed the more the cognitive dissonance if I can call it that at all considering my skepticism as part of the discrepancy between the church history narrative and actual church history  church doctrinal narrative and the churchs actions and other odd things in the church kept gnawing at me.In the end I decided it was not worth my misery and integrity as a Good human being to stay within the church. I find it laughable that the people that talked to me for a while tried to keep track of my spiritual wellbeing instead of my value as a person. But its understandable considering.I will say that close to the end of my membership I felt miserable enough to feel literal heartache and boiling raging blood at some of the things I saw  read  heard about the church and part of its members.If you truly feel that it will be like internal torture anywhere near the degree that Ive felt it to be and I was a simple convert then you do not want to do that to yourself. And you do not want to force that divide between you and your kids if you keep faking until its too late for both you and them.All in all I am way happier following and chasing the truth and gaining knowledge of all things.As for the so called friends? I tried speaking to some in a friendly normal manner but communications with a lot are very strained if they exist at all. Which saddens me in some cases apparently proclaimed lifelong friendships are conditional,exmormon,cnc07jx,2,t5_2r0gj

Ritually enacting out your own gruesome death was eliminated around ? The reason youve heard it associated with weddingssealings is that it was once very common for brides to go through the endowment ceremony immediately before the sealing ceremony.All Mormons must be endowed before being sealed and its rare to be permitted to be endowed unless you need it in preparation for a mission or marriage.  Men typically go through the endowment when they become missionaries but most women didnt need to be endowed until they got married.  As many women had a long trip to the nearest temple it was common to schedule the sealing immediately following her endowment.Now with temples being more common and with many women still complaining about how their wedding days were spoiled by their endowment decades after the fact the trend in the USA is to separate the endowment and the sealing into separate days.Its still uncommon to be permitted to be endowed unless you are preparing for a mission or for a sealing and theres a reason for that.  MANY people find the endowment ceremony extremely culty.  Time and again we hear I only went through with it because a I wanted to go on my mission or b I wanted to get married.,exmormon,cnd9x3w,2,t5_2r0gj

My professor loved to make fun of the common mistakes that missionaries made like saying You look nice today kyou ga kirei desu which actually means You look nice today but not other days.There were three other girls in my class who never went on missions but took college Japanese. Their vocabularies were a lot larger than mine and they could speak and understand pretty well for never having gone to Japan. I think the advantage of going to a foreign country was that I had the opportunity to speak to native speakers.I stopped taking Japanese after one day in the next course though. I couldnt keep up with the amount of kanji Japanese characters we had to learn every week and I didnt understand everything the instructor was saying. I was always embarrassed about speaking Japanese with my mission friends. I was so afraid of making mistakes that I didnt practice as much as I should have.Edit I had a family friend ask me to translate a news interview from Japan about his daughter going missing.

Mom clicked on it ignored the warning and boom.My sister tried to derail one point because she wrongly took it as a veiled attack on her bishop husband. I said I didnt want my daughters in the church because I dont want a yearold daughter of mine to be asked about her chastitymasturbation by a grown man in a closed room. Mom had previously said I should be taking my daughters to church even though Im an atheist.There is no problem when the believers bear their testimonies or post Jesusy stuff but those of us who dont believe are expected to be forever silent on our thoughts feelings and ideas regarding the faith of our youth because it will hurt feelings.

2924255,0,t1_co0h4lu,I knew that at least the ME of the Ensign and by extension the people who were at the magazine around the same time had to be aware to some extent of the issues because she was at the magazine when they published articles about Joseph Smith translating the BoM by putting his head in a hat the Mountain Meadows Massacre Sept.  Ensign etc. However I dont think being well read always means being well read when it comes to Mormonism. There were a couple people at the magazines who I would think knew about historical issues to some extent. I think everyone there would have faced the historical issues with the typical well know after this life and Mormon apologetics approach. Note that these are the same people who edit and publish propagandaesque articles about not questioning your faith. They dont just edit the articles they believe them.They have convinced these people to come to work every day in suits and dresses to have department devotionals to pray before every meeting etc. And they do all of this with gusto. So the belief is strong here.When I interviewed for my internship at Boncom I told the creative director that I wasnt active and had some issues with the church I wanted to make sure I was okay to work there. I mentioned something about John Dehlins podcast on why people leave the church and he seemed irked by my comment. He said something about how the church had done its own research and implied that Johns wasnt up to par.One coworker told me he had had the same issues with the church as me but he was still active. Another coworker had kind of been Mormonhe was BIC but his family never practiced. So he started practicing later on in his marriage but eventually decided it wasnt for him. He was the only nonpracticing Mormon at the ad agency as far as I knew. And his problems were more of a culture thing rather than a history thing. Another coworker was kind of a jack Mormon. He was active but seemed kind of cynical and made jokes about church history.I think that there was a general understanding about some of the church history issues but Im not sure how deep that understanding ran. My impression was that the creative director and my supervisor were aware of the issues but probably didnt have an interest in researching them whether that was through apologetics or whatnot. They were both steadfast members of the church. I guess the best way to explain it is that they had a surface knowledge but they were too busy with what they were doing to really care. They were living life and enjoying it.I do remember having a conversation with my supervisor about how we misrepresent Joseph Smith as having the gold plates in front of them rather than putting his head in a hat. He mentioned that we dont necessarily talk about the mode of translation but just say they were translated by the power of God in the ad copy. So I guess in this way you can see that theres a little manipulation of the message so as to not deter investigators. My supervisor seemed to accept it as a fact of life and didnt seem bothered by it.Plus their jobs depended on their continued belief. So Im sure they didnt care to delve into the issues.Edit To answer your other question was there any discussion? No not really. At church magazines if there ever was it would have been to address a specific issue in an article and I wasnt there for anything like that. At the ad agency our focus was wholly on basic Preach My Gospeltype doctrine. I bet that if the church essays become enough of an issue the missionary department will address church history stuff in the future with some kind of website apart from mormon.org.,exmormon,co0hwir,7,t5_2r0gj

I wanted to know how to better debate Evangelicals when I went on a mission to Seattle. I read FairLDS.org Zions Lighthouse Message Boards and others. None of antimormon arguments phased me one bit. About  years after coming home from the mission I started to see how confirmation bias was real and that I actively ignored data and arguments that dont support my beliefs. I discovered that some of the causal correlations Ive relied on were merely correlations obedience doesnt necessarily imply blessings. In fact I discovered I could do the exact opposite of the Churchs teachings and still be happy blessed and successful. The Prop  issue was pretty much the last straw. The Church clearly lied. I also discovered BYUs treatment of gays in the s which was very very disturbing. Apologists say the Church was ahead of its time when it revealed the Word of Wisdom.

You want to graduate from byuthis means that noone cares or will even know if you do baptisms pass sacrament get a patriarchial blessing attend activities etc. All you need to do is attend the sacrament meeting often enough that the bishop wont notice you being gone all the time. You only need his endorsement and generally if they feel uncomfortable giving it theyll let you know what you need to do to get back on track. Just stay off his radar and youll be fine.As for your personal life... why not speak your mind to your friends within reason? Avoiding certain topics like your liking for sex or being a member only for tuition doesnt mean that you have to pretend to believe in their religion. Speak your opinions and just generally be yourself. You dont have to have church friends to attend byu remember youre only attending church as much as you need to in order to stay off the radar make other friends that you dont feel like you have to hide around.But that being said the university in Orem is also pretty cheap and there is no expectation of being mormon to attend.

3008952,0,t3_2umexj,Can you tell them you are struggling with doubts and your homework  and compromise on say just attending Sacrament meeting?  Of course roundabout options include a Sunday job or attending your local YSA ward and then just doing enough of that to fly under the radar.  You could leave some crazy FAIR stuff lying around the house to give them a hint and maybe even raise questions for them  those people promote ideas that are completely irrational.Only you can guess how your parents might react.  My house my rules is pretty common.  We ask our college age daughter to respect our way of doing things when she is at home in the summer.  Of course that just means dont stumble in super late at night and wake everyone up when they have to work the next day.  Yeah we parents think its all about us.  Its important to take a minute to examine this from the other persons point of view if you want them to do that for you.Im going to guess having been Mormon and being a parent that whether anyone admits it to themselves feeling like you have succeeded in raising a good person is probably important to all of us.  Part of how that is measured is how others see your kid.  Now I am not really all that upset by my daughters reputation as the bad girl among her cousins  but I dont live that close to my family and I dont share their conceptions of modesty.  I personally didnt like the naval piercingcrop top look the Miley Cyrus Halloween costume or the sexy girls headed for frat party photo all of which made her Facebook wall and must have fueled family gossip sessions for weeks.  I wish she would unfriend my cousins and siblings and their kids or at least refrain from posting that stuff in a way they can see it.  I know how smart hardworking focused and compassionate she is so sometimes its hard to know they think she is a wild party girl and Im a bad mom.  I guess what I am trying to say is pathetic as this is just try not to make this really hard on your parents.  Theyve been taught its their most important role in life to save you.  Dont handle this in a way that they are constantly reminded of their failure.  If that means going enough to keep their reputation up and the peace do it.  Give them a plausible story to work with something they can almost understand and tell others without feeling like they want to die inside.  ,exmormon,co9vj4t,3,t5_2r0gj

Now sometimes being a publicist is a good thing.  Hes brought more exposure to many people by giving them a platform to tell their mormon story.  Hes exposed many people to facets of mormon history and the mormon experience that might not have occurred without him.  I also think that his contribution is overstated.But he didnt singlehandedly create the online exmo community.  Hes been adept at manipulating it for good or for evil but he didnt create it.  He also has some major problems and it concerns me that so many exmos throw off one revered leader just to put Dehlin in that same empty space in their lives instead of really rethinking what it means to be a follower and what it means to trust a leader.I can appreciate what he has done and what he has done is to mostly create exposure for others stories while still being leery of his movement and sycophants and his many public flipflops.  I can appreciate his work but I can separate that from personal devotion and neardeification in the minds of some.Yeah hes done some cool things and yeah hes done some shady things.

I was once where you are and I decided I needed to see the original documents for myself to make a decision.

Feel free to use my research there as it almost uniformly links to original documents.But dont take my word for it or ukolobots or your mission president or your parents.

3032531,0,t3_2uv6to,When I was on the high counsel we were asked all the time if the participant could record the proceedings.  We never allowed them to do it because the church leadership all the way up to the st presidency has said no proceedings are ever to be recorded.  The bad thing is there is a scribe always assigned by the Stake President to take notes.  My experience is this was assigned randomly to one of the high counsel members. I got assigned to do this a lot and the notes of the proceeding went into the persons permanent file in Salt Lake City. We never had anyone that we know of actually record the proceedings.  We never had anyone sign an agreement to not record it so your Stake President must be on high alert. I would recommend if you sign the agreement that you not record it. Its an integrity issue and you dont want the church coming back and saying look Delin has no integrity as he signed an agreement not to record but did it anyways then a lot of the members who may be sympathetic to your plight start to question.  I know the church has no integrity in their proceedings.  But I think it will come back and hurt you if you sign it. If you dont sign it they wont allow you into the proceedings.  So you are kind of stuck. They wont allow any of your witnesses to sit through entire proceedings either. They will be brought in give their testimony and then asked to leave.  Generally they will only allow your Bishop in with you. They purposely make it one sided in other words they can use whatever they want take minutes of the meeting and have who ever they want present. You cant.  That is why its a complete Kangaroo court.

Someone here on exmormon links to it and lots of people here get very upset. Someone else here starts looking into the blogger and finds out he works for the church and he was convicted of sexual assault several years ago. They also find some sketchy Wikipedia activity by a specific user there with a page being created about him and an aggressive move to delete the CES Letter article being made by said user. People start flooding the comments section of his blog post criticizing him and linking to the news article about his assault conviction. Alahverdian comes over here to exmormon to do an AMA and give his side of the story especially about his conviction. The AMA goes very very badly for him. He gets tons of criticism some of it very personal some of it more moderate. He announces elsewhere online that exmormons cyber terrorists are flooding his social media accounts and harrassing him. He wipes his blog locks down his Twitter feed deletes his newly created reddit account and tweets John Dehlin asking for help.

3096853,0,t3_2vlucp,I questioned the church as a little girl who prayed every night for Father in Heaven to change me into a little boy. I beat up other boys like a boy I liked some girls like a boy I joined the military and still God would not make me a boy.And then one day I met another boy. I had dated guys before but this one was different. Huzzah! Lust at first sight. And he was very Mormon which wasnt a problem for me because if  hours a week with my hips in the pew made him happy I would stay Mormon til my dying day. I had deepseated doubts but meh. Everyone doubts. As we got to know each other better real better and then all the way better I started to feel comfortable for the first time with who I was. My husband was no macho man he was sensitive and loving and caring and sweet. And he made me feel like I could be that way too and people might still take me seriously.I went to the temple with him as his wife not his buddy. The initiatory was one of the most spiritual feelings Ive ever had.And then the endowment ceremony took that feeling nailed it into a coffin buried it  feet under and salted the Earth it was buried in. It was finally made clear to me that if Heavenly Father really loved me he would have made me a man. Thank you endowment ceremony for making that abundantly clear. I continued to support my husband in his church attendance and callings while my testimony waned. Church made him seem...older. Heavier. Sadder. Angrier. We had a baby after  years of togetherness. His baby blessing was one of the most beautiful genuine things Ive ever heard. In those moments of listening to my husband earnestly pleading with God to keep our son safe I realized I would murder someone if I had to for my little family. I could never ever ever sit silently and watch someone harm these two people. If my son were like me he would not be able to live a genuine life. If he were gay raising him in the church would be straight up child abuse. Ive never been so angry nor full of such rabid need to protect my family. But if I would be willing to die break laws lie or straight up kill someone to protect my kid hell yes I was willing to quit a fucking religion. ,exmormon,coizktg,2,t5_2r0gj

But be careful there are plenty of facts about the history of the church which could possibly cause you to question.  Take care and thanks for your interest and sincere questions.  ,exmormon,comrarw,5,t5_2r0gj
3133410,0,t1_comrarv,First the bible. Oh boy I was never really into scripture I read what I was supposed to and repeated the verses at the door like I was told. The first time I read the bible for real not the New World Translation the Living Bible was when I first started having doubts. Yes the changes were crazy even more shocking was how the old school jws just sucked it up and talked about how awesome it was. They dont promote the people who translate or write it. Youd have to dig deep to find out who actually worked on it. All you need to know is its Gods word and you need to swallow it whole.Ive known at least half a dozen anointed. Some seemed genuine and others came off as nuts. I think the current understanding is that the  were chosen after . That gives them a lot of room for error. When I was in the understanding was that the choosing began on pentecost  c.e. when the tongues of fire anointed the faithful. But since Armageddon was supposed to come before the last of the anointed died they had to change their stance. Especially after the number of anointed started to rise a few years ago.Deep doctrine? Not really nothing exciting. Its pretty basic do what we print or else.I think the smoking gun is the failed predictions and the truth about the founder. If the average jw knew the truth about those things they may start to think for themselves. But most would probably shake their heads and say it was Satans propaganda. ,exmormon,comrxnq,3,t5_2r0gj

3136332,0,t3_2w0dp0,Ive been there I was a super TBM when my husband expressed doubts he boomeranged and now he is TBM sigh  This is what I would say to herDear eltiburonmormons wifeYou are going through a very difficult time right now. To me it felt like the ground fell out from under me and my whole world was falling down around me. I spent so long crying. When we got married it was going to be forever we did everything right and we were going to be one of the good families faithful and active. Then all of a sudden that changed and my marriage was different. It wasnt what I signed up for. Everything that we ever did seemed to be in question now. What about family home evening what about blessings at meals do I have to bring my children to church alone? Who am I going to get to baptize and ordain my children and what will I say to them when they ask why it couldnt be Daddy? So many tears so many fears and who could I go to? I hadnt done anything but suddenly everything was different and it isnt my fault!Trust me when I tell you you are going through the worst of it right now. Things can get better they will get better. When the church is such a fundamental part of your life and your marriage it is impossible to imagine it any other way. Give it some time. The decision to break up a family is a big one and once you make it it is hard to undo. On the other hand the decision to wait a while  months a year  years isnt a lasting or binding decision.  I promise that you will make a better decision if you make a decision after some time has passed.  Giving it time gives both of you the opportunity to figure out your life with this change. You can work things out you can discuss things you can come to agreements. If after you have tried everything else it still doesnt work you can make the decision to break up your family then. The wonderful things about your husband that you loved married and started a family with are still there. Eternal marriage isnt just about a marriage lasting a long time eternal marriage means that your marriage has power and strength to overcome even monumental obstacles. I dont know if your relationship can over come this one but I dont think you will regret giving it a try.,exmormon,con2stq,4,t5_2r0gj

I believed the church teachings that thinking about sinning was as bad as actually sinning.  In my mind I felt as bad as though he had an affair.Instead start talking to her about why TSCCs stance is damaging to young men.  Tell her that you want to teach your son things based on science.  Tell her you want him to have healthier attitudes about sexuality than the ones you developed in TSCC.  It is commendable to want to be honest but you are entitled to a few private things  in marriage.

3168387,0,t3_2weruz,Although I generally agree with everyone to not let her take the kids.. more importantly is to not have her call the cops on you because you get into a big fight and wont let her leave. The magic number with kids is  months. And this only applies if they move out of state. Once a child has been in another state for  months that new state has authority to decide custody issues. So depending on where she is taking the kids should put you on high alert primarily if its out of state. If so to protect your rights you would want to be talking to a lawyer now and at least by the  month mark of her being gone to make sure you get something filed. Most important is to stay in the marital home. Her taking the kids out of the marital home is bad on her. Start documenting everything. Especially your attempts and requests to keep the kids in the marital home. Be overly nice and overly considerate but be firm in your requests for her to stay and for you to keep the kids. If she is planning on separationdivorce it is a common tactic for a parent usually the mother to take the kids out of state act like they are planning to reconcile and then at the  month mark file for divorce and full custody.

They systematically slander anyone who speaks of the cheaters actions and use their influence to rewrite the story as they see fit. It is akin to standing by the serial cheaterabuser because hes a fun guy to play poker with on the weekends even after you hear his wifes screams.

Its easy and every program from Outlook to gmail hotmail iCloud etc. has the option. Just google how to do it and follow a stepbystep.Then instruct someone who can pass the message along that abusive characters are absolutley forbidden from interacting with your family and that until he show equal respect and refrain from religious subjects entirely he will be cut out of your familys life.Never be without transport during any future interactions and do not hesitate to stand up and leave the very second he break the rules. Zerotolerance. If he is worth having in your life he can be retrained. If he refuses to reform then he is a toxic character and it is negligent on your part to expose your children to him.

Since having a man explain to women that we are wrong in how we describe or interpret our own experiences is a common problem comments that seem to bend that way tend to strike a nerve.That said I agree that  years for this to continue as a problem is a long time and professional therapy may very much be in order. But if they havent been exmo for very long OP didnt specify that may be a factor in the time frame as well.On a side note Im genuinely curious have you really known hundreds of couples who have talked with you openly about their sex lives?

Places medieval scholarship learning and prophecy but more like a fledgling air craft that wont quite take off because it doesnt have the principles. Science has those principles. Its based on vast cultural autocorrect instead of fake it till you make it. but no one ever makes it,exmormon,cp1tv2t,0,t5_2r0gj

Your parents have every right to lock down the devices and internet usage that I totally support.  Children shouldnt have unfettered internet access anyway.   However the making him talk to a bishop discussing it as a whole family piping in holy music making him do extra church work thats all just shaming guilting and brainwashing.  This should be handled so delicately as to not make the poor kid feel ashamed of himself and instead your mother is taking the bull in a china shop approach.  Also shouldnt this be something that the dad is approaching him with?  Ive never been a  year old boy but I have been a  year old girl.  If my dad had approached me about my sexuality at that age which was seriously honestly nonexistent I would have been mortified.  I can imagine its even worse with a boy who is at the cusp of his sexuality being interrogated by his mom cousins grandma etc. Would she be open to having him talk to you in lieu of the entire family?

I am not saying to go and put on garments again but redirect your energy.She wants you to try to believe and that is rough and unhealthy. A psychologist told me not to do that because when my mother made the same request. Those leaving this cult suffer a great deal and are trying to undo the decades of inculcation. You could start studying secularism and humanism and show her similarities. Try meditation.My wife and I are coming up on  years. Luckily shes not an extreme TBM so she is taking it quite well. She is more hurt than angry. I got her a puppy since we do not have kids and that has been great for us both. I also dont bring up the subject much and do not say things like I know its all bogus.From another standpoint and you and others might not like this perspective but here it goes depending on how long youve known your wife this might be a good time to cut your losses and get out. If you do not have kids had the typical short mormon datingengagement then you might not actually have that much of a history worth saving in the big picture. This is just another perspective you know all the details and are in the best position to make a choice. If you do not have kids a long history etc. it would be wise to consider all your options as objectively as possible.I offered my wife a divorce if she wanted it because I have seriously changed the game plan for her and I understand that.

This continued for months until one day she wanted me to buy a coffee maker for her. I told her to buy her own coffee maker and then decided it was time to learn the doctrine of exactly why coffee is wrong even though its not mentioned by name in the WoW so I could explain it to her.  I started on LDS.org which of course had no explanation. This led me to google which led to the CES Letter which led to this sub. After about two weeks straight of reading I realized it was all fake and that Joseph Smith was actually an evil evil man.   The thing for me was I had to want to discover the truth for myself before I was open to the possibility of thinking that things didnt add up.  Once I started looking for the truth it was easy to see all the lies. Also the other thing that helped was not going to church.  I didnt have a calling since we had just moved so I didnt have a responsibility to show up.  Getting over the indoctrination of having to do my duty to God by doing whatever the leaders told me was very hard until I didnt have a responsibility.  Then I actually had the free time to study. Also I notice that I enjoyed Sundays SOOOO much more!  We actually had more family time!  I resigned when I listened to the leaders talk about Joseph Smith in General Conference.

This mistrust has little to do with the problems with the churchs historical claims so all of the evidence against the church just doesnt mean very much to me.

There was this huge sandy bank with a bunch of trash in a pile like clothes and cans and such totally looked like people had been hanging out there and in the sand there was this message laid out with sticks saying Nick Loves Josh or Josh loves Nick or something like that. Definitely Nick and Josh though and definitely Love.I still look back fondly on that day eating lunch out of a can canoe half on the sand and talking about what crazyawesome hijinks Nick and Josh got up to together. You go NickampJosh. I hope you had a great night by the river! Ah yes. That was the best time I had at Camp. That and the anime first years of another ward that I was in charge of.I suppose this isnt so much a worst camp story but I already was so turned off by church things that I was so there just for the social aspect and spent a lot of time engrossed in that. Testimony meetings were a horror though I already realized I didnt have a testimony and didnt feel like there was a way to fix that from all the stories I heard of other peoples testimonies.

I was always watching and reading books that included the big bang and all sorts of tough topics for Mormons who accept a pure and literal view if the universe based on the bible and JS and past prophets. My TBM dad doesnt bother with it and just says Doesnt matter what it is because itll be what its supposed to beMy ultra TBM mom has absolutely no capacity to understand or accept even a possibility that the universe was created with a big bang. Shes a really smart person too but the church has squashed all of it out of her. I know its apologetic but its what I think and how I accept science while still being Christian.

3618304,0,t3_31sanl,Right before I was to leave on my mission early s I confessed to touching my girlfriends boob. They made me wait a month before leaving. During that time they made me work at the Church Office Building. I dont remember the name of the office I worked in but I was basically a skip tracer. I would track down lost members. There was a whole room full of people doing just that. We used all the same methods creditors do to find people. Talked to any family members. Searched databases. Called any number we could find. If I found the right number but the person refused to give me their address there was a computer I could use to do a reverse lookup on the phone number to find the address. Only one computer in the room could do that.

In the initiatory the thing that was mind bending was women using the priesthood and laying their hands on my head.  I was so unprepared for that because you dont see women using the priesthood outside of the temple.  I also thought the entire endowment ceremony was cultish and ritualistic.  I didnt understand how this could be the same church that I attended on Sunday.  I got particularly freaked out when I had to veil my face.  I was also freaked out that I had brought my sweet convert husband into this.   When it was over my mother said Well wasnt that exactly what you expected?  I just stared at her.

To say that God purposefully set in motion a chain of events that resulted in Adam and Eve is a long winded and unnecessary way to say God created Adam and Eve. In no way is that a strange novel or unusual definition of create.

Whenever I hear him talk about his therapy sessions I always wonder if this is just some complicated scheme to part him from his money.  I know that sex addiction is not in officially in the DSM  but that doesnt prevent a lot of assholes out there willing to take your money to help you out with your problem.I also know the church offers a  step program to help you with this problem as well but if you want to call this addiction real and actually help people with this problem dont use the worse piece of shit program that was ever invented.  I mean give these people some thing they can actually use to help them in their life.  And I will give you some hints on this.  The assistance they need is not from the Holy Ghost and it is not reading more scriptures.  Also another thing what are the withdrawal symptoms do these sex addicts have?  I admit I am ignorant on this one myself.  But I once went into a lock down facility I have a buddy that is a cop and it was some eyes wide shut type of shit that was going down with people that were in various stages of withdrawal.  I mean for these people addicted to drugs they have quite an ordeal to go through to get clean.  Does this happen to sex addicts?  If it does I have never seen it please enlighten me.  I mean I am pretty dumb when it comes to life and its foibles.  Like for example I just found out that the guy that has been touted as THE culture hero in my life is nothing more than a con man a pedophile and an adulterer.

First lets get this out of the way human nature and basic social pressure means there are no s.  I would put Universal Unitarians at about a  or  Mormonism at about a  and JWs at about a . or  with Scientology around the same.

It also means  people must become  during the th year. That is what your formula does. It bases everything off of the initial population. It works mathematically but it doesnt really fit because populations dont grow like that  which is why your formula seems misleading.

Using your formula that is a growth rate of . double check me here as well. For the BoM people to grow from  people to  would require a growth rate of  again double check me. You refuse to see that as highly improbable  rather you want me to tell you how many children each couple has to have. I cant answer that because I dont know the rate of death. How many died each year from old age disease crime war suicide accidents animals child birth complications etc?

Do you really think they should tear up the american constitution just because its signed by racists? Or rename alot of cities etc like washington...Do you really think the afroamerican community in washington care alot about that their city is named after a slave owner? Probably not. I think that is just silly and stupied to focus on the fact that BYU got its name from someone in the past who had racist opinions.

Considering Cowderys relationship to A View of the Hebrews and that he was a teacher and that The Late War between the United States and Great Britain was an educational book in circulation near and around both Smith and Cowdery it is difficult for me to dismiss that Oliver was not a major contributor for the writing style and contents of the book. EDIT Wrong early mormon dude. Also now that I see it was Martin Harris the other part of the comment I wanted to make stands up Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris both had vested interests in seeing the success of the Book of Mormon which is another reason why I think they maintained their testimonies to their graves. ,exmormon,cqdj313,2,t5_2r0gj

These are needed for producing hormones and dopamine so if you are already fairly low in them you will probably notice negative effects like lower motivation libido and mood if you are ejaculating often.The desire to watch excessive porn in my opinion is usually just a symptom that your social life could use some more work.

That same mystery can be used as evidence for any and all faith traditions. You just happen to be raised in the Mormon faith so it makes sense to you to use it to explain something about the Mormon god. A Catholic would use it to explain some mystery about the Catholic faith. Maybe dark matter is where Mohammad resides with his virgins.

Joseph and Oliver werent at the correct place and time.  We also have to wonder about why this priesthood restoration wasnt mentioned sooner.  And why was Joseph preaching that priesthoods were a sign of a false church in  if he had just had this miraculous visitation?What makes the most sense to non LDS historians is that Josephs theology was evolving and he was creating a myth to support his changing theology.

I figured out my son was gay at .  He used to have sleep overs with girls but they were always his friends and there was something that pretty much convinced me that he was heading in that direction. But I said nothing and didnt really worry too much about it. But it was obvious.  He came out when he was . I was ready for it and today we are best friends and he has continued to amaze me at what a great kid he is. The issue you need to be concerned about right now is not that she is bi or whatever. But at  she needs some significant boundaries that you arent setting. Kids being curious on the internet  yeah not an issue all kids are.  A  year old chatting with strangers on the internet? Wow.  I have a  year old daughter who is not allowed to have any internet accounts  no facebook no youtube no twitter. Nothing.  You need to set some serious boundaries for her including how much time and what not she can spend with tulip if they are a couple but also I dont know that I would freak out about her being a couple at . Most likely will fizzle into nothing.No you should not contact the mother. I know you said its not. But I get a small sense that deep down you are not okay with having a gay kid.  If I am wrong dont hate.  I will admit that at first as a solid TBM I struggled with the thought of having a gay son but before he came out to me two years before he told his mom I decided I was going to support him no matter what and not marginalize him in any way. And I dont think I ever have. And so you know.  He is  now and is openly gay. His family TBM grandparents uncles and aunts have all fully accepted him.

Well in highschool they tried to make me take esl yeah it was racist to assume i didnt know english because i was not white its racist when i go to apply for a loan at a bank or apply to a school and they ask for my birth certificate and my white peers never have to do that so yeah i see it as racist. Beside the fact that california arizona texas was part of mexico people have the gull to call me illegal. when I probably technically have more rights to be here. But no they judge me and they are racist. Whites call themselves just americans and they call the REAL americans the native americans native americans how racist is that? When i call my white friends angloamerican scottish american irishamerican they lose their minds. So yeah maybe i find it a little racist! I also notice the racism in the educational material presented in classes indian and chinese and even the mayan contributed to the science of math but they never get mentioned! Im starting to think that the education in the usa for what its worth is in favor of white americans or european whitesI asked one of my school counselors why i got asked for my birth certificate.

However traditional SEO states that the more people you have linking to you the higher your site is ranked on Google.The search engine sees that lots of people link to you so you must have good content and youre ranked higher. If a highprofile site links to you its bumps you up even more.OP is saying that the Church is linking to Mormon.org from LDS.org to improve the Google ranking of those Mormon.org pages. Thats fine whatever right?But there is a way to code your links that they no longer show up blue to the reader. Now they can put links wherever they want and no reader will notice. Why would they want to do this?This can be used to clandestinely put in tons of links without showing them just to have Google say Wow Mormon.org gets hundreds on links from other sites so they must be great!Regularly seeing tons of links scattered throughout an article looks really bad like spam.

3951946,0,t3_35o5vp,Im currently reading listening on audible to a book called Blood of the Prophets Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows. Having gone from knowing nothing about MMM except that there was an event where people died and that was what it was called to reading this book all I can say is what the actual fuck. Im about a fourth of the way through the listening right now after pretty much filling my spare time with it and I can tell you that it does a fantastic job setting the stage of MMM and the social political economical and religious tension at the time. Its just barely gotten to the actual account of the MMM and Im glad it took so long detailing what was happening during the years up to it it even includes a brief summary of Joes  woman filching habits as well as some key figures and their seemingly innocuous actions P.P. Pratt meets a woman in Los Angeles and it seems so minor but its included for obvious reasons later.It was designed to be not a replacement but an extension of Juanita Brooks book as some of the accounts discussed were not available to Brook at the time... or so it was explained in the beginning of the BotP book. IMO reading the book as a book would be tedious with the constant uses of names and dates to clarify who was where and at what time but listening to it is quite fascinating. And horrifying. And enlightening. As a BIC the early history of the church that of their tenure in Utah as a territory was always and they drove us from our homes in missouri and killed our prophet and we went across the desert and it was terrible but we got to SL and founded a city and then there were locusts and they were terrible but eventually we became a state and part of  America and everything was fine coughafterpolygamyendedcough.Sorry for the rant.

3954280,0,t3_35qmb8,gtAm I missing something?Nope those are just overzealous exMos letting their imaginations run wild. The church is experiencing real growth albeit at a stagnant pace. Its already on the cusp of its plateau and it will never actually reach  million active before it starts a very slow descent into shrinkage like the Episcopalians and the like. It far more statistically probable to project that there will still be around  million active by the end of the century. The church will not collapse it will just become more insular and fundamentalist and more insignificant to the outside world than it already is. However the Mormon church is declining as both a percentage share of both the American and world population and increasing the rate of that decline so thats hardly a rough stone rolling filling up the earth.In the meantime read the new Pew Research data and check over at TBMfriendly source cumorah.com for more details. ,exmormon,cr70sbr,5,t5_2r0gj

I disconnected myself from the church  years ago when i was . meanwhile my parents and some other family members occasionally give me these come to jesus interventions which I actually really enjoy because its fun for me to ask them questions that I know they cant answer. A year amp a half ago my dad invited me to priesthood session afterward as we were walking back I asked him if he really believes the church BOM JS etc. He wouldnt immediately give me a straight answer but eventually it came out that he doesnt believe the church anymore and hasnt for years. This really pissed me off because that means my father had been lying amp trying to push me back into the church for years despite knowing it was all lies. It still frustrates me to this day because my mother and recently RM brother still gang up on me with these come to jesus interventions and my dad wont defend me nor the church anymore im sure my mom is suspicious I understand why he wont take sides because he cant let my mom know that he doesnt believe anymore because of the family issues it would cause. I wont tell mom that dad doesnt believe either because my mom prefers comfy lies to the bitter truth anyway... The point is if you keep lying to them and they find out later it can cause some serious trust issues.

I think it is great that at least in the nonMormon world there is less pressure to have kids no matter your inclination.So my read on it is if you really want kids have them but not until you are emotionally and financially ready for them.

4064732,0,t3_37479n,I believe Joseph Smith started off thinking how can I make some money.   After all his treasure seeking scheme wasnt working and Joseph was poor.  So I think he came up with a golden plate story perhaps even forging some gold like plates and keeping them hidden under a cloth as to not draw attention to them otherwise I think he would have sold the gold plates instead of trying to sell the copyright of the BOM  When selling the copyright of the Book of Mormon didnt work out he and his close cohorts decided to sell copies one by one.  I think people bought copies and started to inquire about this new book of possible scripture.  They were coming all over asking Joseph to explain this new American continent scripture.  I think Joseph Smith came up with a plan and said he would tell people he saw heavenly beings who told him to write a book.  Im sure he wondered how can he make this sound believable to people... He had four first vision accounts to try and get it right  All these accounts were recorded after the supposed translation of the BOM with a seer stone in a hat as we now knowThe rest is history and the followerspower he received went to his head.  He was able to scheme money away from church members forming his own bank stating it was revelation of God to do so. He was able to get plural marriage and young women to marry him by calling it a revelation  Smith knew what he was doing.  The church trys to makes him out to look like an uneducated person.

4069308,0,t3_3753fu,Losing my faith in the church led me not only to to deconstruct my religion but to also deconstruct how I perceived my husband. The things that were most admirable to me started to disgust me. He seemed overbearingly patriarchal. I noticed how he would laugh at silly things Id say thinking he always knew better than me. He put an imaginary being above our marriage. He blamed me for things that were his own fault. He eventually left me over my faith issues. I look back at our separation and wonder if I would have been the one to eventually leave if he hadnt initiated the divorce.Living with the thought that one wrong move can end your marriage is a horrible and abusive way to live. Having to maintain such a fragile balance is stifling. This is the only life we getas far as we can telland its too short to waste being miserable with the wrong person. People always talk about making sacrifices for the good of your marriage but no sacrifice is worth damaging your emotional spiritual or physical health. I loved my husband and I thought I would crumble into pieces after he left me. It was hard but the dust has settled nearly a year later. And now I wonder whether that desire to stay together would have lasted if I had allowed my husband to continue to dictate the kind of life I was allowed to live. That kind of stress would have eventually crushed me.Personally you sound unhappy in your marriage. Keeping it together for your child is a noble endeavor but perhaps not the best reason to stay. Some research suggests that divorce is better for kids in an unhappy marriage.I think divorce would be a very difficult brave choice. If you choose to stay with your husband I hope youll seek therapy for yourself and your relationship. Someone like a therapist can be objective and help you see things for what they are.,exmormon,crk4nrj,2,t5_2r0gj

4076596,0,t1_crky4uc,One thing the JWs love is statistics. Every January they release the Annual Report which shows the number of active publishers hours preached bible studies conducted and number baptized amp  growth from the previous year for all  countries theyre in. Its easy to figure out how many left because all you need to do is take the current number minus the number baptized and find the difference from the precious year to get the number of people whove left either by death or disfellowshipping.When a JW leaves your door they have a slip of paper. They write your address name date of initial contact what issue of the magazine they left with you and any other observation for example has kids... bring books about family life or older couple bring book about gods promise to reverse aging in paradise. Then they also fill out a time slip every month and turn it into an elder whose title is service overseer. You report how many hours you worked amount of literature handed out bible studies conducted and return visits made. ALL of that data is collected monthly and sent to headquarters. The service overseer also keeps a record of your average hours spent. If you dip below the national average usually  hrs a month they will have a little chat with you. If you dont report time for a month youre considered irregular and may get a visit. Missing  months is considered inactive and guarantees a visit called a shepherding call where  elders drop in at your house to offer encouragement.,exmormon,crkyi4l,3,t5_2r0gj

I told him about all the joyous things the gospel has brought into my life and how I have been so blessed since we last met.  He just seemed so distant and didnt really bring up anything about his life.  It must be so sad and awful to be lost from the one true gospel.  I was afraid if I asked about his family he might be upset since things cant be going so well for him and he might say something antiMormon.

4101501,0,t3_37lugk,I am guessing you are a reasonably straight white man in a very Mormon area with mostly LDS family?  My dad stayed in and active despite doubts because his experience was mainly positive.  It helped him connect with his community and think about his values.  As an intelligent woman with mixed race daughters and gay friends living in California I found myself always angry over things said in church.  My wards over the years have helped me to meet some truly wonderful people but I felt the messages of love and understanding were drowned out by the Prop  campaign and constant reminders of a womans role.  I taught on the campus of a highly diverse university the most colorblind environment I have ever experienced.  Only in church was I surrounded by an allwhite group where I was not the equal of the men around me and looked down on by some women for my career choices and small family.  As my daughter started YW we had a meeting with the bishop and it really brought home to me how intense the emphasis on temple marriage to an RM is.  And to me that wasnt important certainly not enough to spend all that time on.  We bought passes to Disneyland and SeaWorld and made Sundays family time growing closer than ever.  We poured that time and effort into helping her pursue her real goals.  She is just  and has done things I wouldnt have dreamed of  she has trained with the New York City Ballet become a paid blogger written cover pieces for national magazines and will soon graduate cum laude from a public Ivy.  Her friends are a rainbow of races and sexual orientations but all are interesting and driven. Her much younger sister is poised for her own adventures. I dont think we could have given them the same kind of support if our lives were focused around callings and our finances limited by tithing.  And none of us were truly happy sitting in that chapel either.  It felt like a chore.A couple of years after leaving my kids expressed an interest in the church down the street  nice coffee shop Christian Rock doughnuts and coffee before the meetings...  I was so impressed by the amount of actual charity they did.  They asked for contributions of only  from those who could afford to give and publicly reported all spending.  Missions were paid from those funds and all were service focused.  I was reluctant to go and uncomfortable at first but I couldnt believe how many ways it was better.  Meetings were short inspiring and fun.  And the first time I participated in communion I was stunned to tears by the fact that women helped pass the sacrament.  As if that was normal.  Because we are equal.Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that Christianity has many of the same flaws as Mormonism.  And I just cant accept any exclusionary one true doctrine.  But if I were to feel I was missing something I wouldnt go back to the LDS church.  Id choose a better one.As it is Im happy and filled with purpose.  Its pretty clear God either doesnt exist or needs a lot of help.  Its up to us to go do what we can.  I prefer other volunteer options to callings.But I wish you the best.  I think staying in was a good choice for my dad.  And you can do a lot of good by being loving and accepting especially of people who are different like gay teens.,exmormon,crnsofx,69,t5_2r0gj
4102759,0,t3_37mfdt,As others have said start a blog. Seriously not only do you have good content for it like the above story for starters but also because then when questioned about it you can say the Bishop gave you the idea to start sharing your personal beliefs especially those about equality for all people on a blog. Though you did not have a blog at that time and had never thought of making one it seemed like a good idea so you started one. Then you can post their reactions to you having a blog on your blog. Literally the only thing on your blog could be the things the Church does to try and stop you from having said blog.

I love spending my Sundays with my kids and going on walks and hikes and not stressing out getting  kids to church where none of them wanted to be anyway.

4137924,0,t1_crrwmpo,Gawdz youre right and that points to the sickness of the system. Its messing up lives left and right. The system puts vulnerable people in vulnerable positions both the bishop and the young woman in the case at hand. Overworked stressed bishop with an overworked stressed wife at home. Both are sexually repressed. Lets put add an emotionally distraught impressionable young woman to the mix who has been taught to revere the man as a spiritual giant who can be completely and fully trusted because he represents Jesus himself and Jesus chose him for that post. What could go wrong?Edited to add There are fifteen men with the power to change this in an afternoon. Even by themselves any single one of them with courage could bring the issue to the forefront of awareness and thereby do a world of good. So far none of those fifteen oops  fourteen for now men  if we can call them that  have achieved the level of integrity or courage of those who have awakened from the hoax and have the courage to admit it to themselves and their loved ones.,exmormon,crrxx6s,3,t5_2r0gj

My wife and I still dont agree about the church right now though shes gone from a black amp white TBM to somewhat of a NOM in the last year but our marriage is much stronger than it was when I first told her I no longer believed in the church.I would also suggest that you take things slowly and dont force anything on her.

If exmormons were practicing invasive solicitation I believe you would have something. However the sharing of views and opinions publicly and privately is fundamental to the pursuit of understanding. The idea that we should remain quiet because our opinions and views are unwelcome is dangerous and wrong. Arguments and opinions are the lifeblood of understanding. Hell I may have never made it out if people on the other side had remained silent about Mormonism. If Mormons want to get me back and they do they are free to present whatever arguments and ideas they want and Ill do my best to review them. I only draw the line when they solicit or otherwise invade my private space. The Internet is not my private space. Its not dickish for me to criticize or otherwise confound Mormons with links to the CES Letter nor is it dickish for them to send me links to their favorite conference talks unless they embellish the links with personal attacks which is sometimes the case but I digress.,exmormon,crsfq31,2,t5_2r0gj

I had never been to a sealing before my own and when I found out I couldnt wear my wedding dress and that I would have to wear a terribly plain white high neck and long sleeve formless dress with all of those temple accessories I just about ran out. I felt seriously tricked. That was not how I saw myself getting married.

4196997,0,t3_38xln1,Im with you on having a measured response to The Late War.The statistical method developed by the Johnsons for rediscovering the book was clever but as I understand it it was never intended to return any sort of numerical likelihood that any particular book was source material for the BoM. In other words no threshold is given beyond which we should decide whether a book is or isnt an influence on the BoM and establishing such a threshold would be arbitrary.The quotes from both books that are often posted are cobbled together across multiple chapters but presented in a way that makes them appear to be much more similar than they actually are in the text. And thats totally unnecessary since the similarity of both books is still quite obvious without having to do that.The main takeaway for me is that writing in Jacobian English for no other reason than to sound authoritative and to do it in book full of bombastic American ethnocentricism was not unheard of in the th century.It also shows that if you mimic a book translated from ancient Hebraic languages such as the Bible your madeup book will automatically have some Hebraisms.Both very interesting worthwhile lessons. It makes me cringe when people treat this as a bigger smoking gun than say one hundred other ridiculous things about church doctrine.TLDR Yes the BoM is made up yes The Late War probably inspired some of it but its not the smoking gun you might think it is at first glance.,exmormon,crynjqv,30,t5_2r0gj

4201522,0,t1_crz15cp,You started your comment by saying you love the logic of these types of posts... by the end of your post I wasnt so sure... Thats an interesting point you bring up up. The purpose of the church... Im sure it makes you feel better about the fact that there are starving boney kids with bloated stomachs. Its not my fault its not my churches fault. Its the members in the area... they should b giving more. The church should b about perfecting the saints. Never has it been about feeding starving innocents for a day. The catholics have way better things than us. So were fine ...   The catholics are the great abominable whore remember? Mcconkie made that clear. So by all means use them as your watermark. Or maybe the church will release an essay on that not being true soon too  The members in the area should help them. Ummm. There arent many of those. Possibly because they werent allowed full fellowship because they werent white and delitesome. The Church just released an essay on this topic and let us know the former prophets were wrong about keeping them out. Have u read the essay on LDS.org? Do u know enough about your church to be able to understand the things the church is distancing itsself from were things stated over the pulpit by prophets? If you have a smidgen of the ability of being honest with yourself and the ability to process information u will see this is a major problem. Multiple prophets just messed up on something that keeps an entire race of the Lords people out of his house. This is too big to write off. For me it was. I was a fully active member in EQ presidency RM temple goer. when I realized this it changed everything. If they can be wrong about this could they b wrong about other things? How bout a  billion dollar amount luxury mall? Could those funds be used to help people? I know its an investment. ... My god is bigger than that. He takes  fish and feeds hundreds remember? Could they b wrong with how they hide what they do with the church funds? Everytime they donate any money they make sure KSL cameras are rolling but the rest is private. Its estimated the church only gives  to the poor. Its leaked that s and apostles are paid. Even though i bragged on my mission about our church having a unpaid ministry. Why hide the records if theres nothing to hide? What else could they b wrong about? Tithing? Polygamy? Book of Abraham? Weve opened Pandoras box with one LDS.org essay. Saying the members in Africa arent doing enough to help was the worst thing u could say. I am unable to read the new testament and believe that Jesus is pleased as the expensive timber in Africa rolls past thousands of starving children on the way to his house. Id love to hear a rebuttal. Im still open to information. If u have a different point to any of these things please feel free to share. ,exmormon,crz5zca,3,t5_2r0gj

One day when Joseph Smith was either    or  or maybe even  or  he decided to pray in his bedroom or in the woods because he didnt know which church was true or because he figured out from the Bible that all churches were wrong possibly because there was a revival in the area and he either really really trusted God would answer him or he wanted to know if God even existed or he didnt decide to pray and all this stuff Im going tell you about kind of just happened. After either being attacked or not attacked by Satan he saw Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ andor just the Lord andor a pillar of fire with two personages in it andor a host of angels andor one angel andor a spirit. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ andor just the Lord andor the pillar of fire with two personages in it andor the host of angels andor the angel andor the spirit either told him or didnt tell him that his sins were forgiven and either told him or didnt tell him that all churches were wrong. Whoever it was may or may not have told him some stuff about the Book of Mormon too. After his vision people from other churches may have been really mean to him or maybe they werent.

4239280,0,t1_cs3f0xa,gt but it cant explain specific evilsAnd it doesnt need to any more than an atheist world view needs to.  According to Mormon theology evil just is.  God exists in the universe God did not create the universe.  The Problem of Evil is a very specific logical argument against a very specific God.  It isnt more than that.  gtWhy does he help Mormons find their keysI would imagine any Mormon that is attempting to use logic to evaluate their faith would simply say he doesnt.    You are conflating many Mormons beliefs in God and Mormon theology.  Mormon theology does not define a God that helps people do inconsequential things.   When I was a Mormon on thought Bednars tender mercies talk was dumb as it made no sense based on the Plan of Salvation. So yes Mormonism depending on your brand solves the Problem of Evil.  But its important to note that the Problem if Evil doesnt need solving.  The Problem of Evil is an argument for theists and deists not atheists its meant to help theists define possible Gods.   Atheists like me dont believe in a God we dont need to narrow our search of possible Gods from X to X.   I dont feel like putting the effort into answer all of your questions.  It sounds like you just had a very different understanding of Mormon theology than I did when I was Mormon.  Things like...gt but why does God mitigate some evil but apparently not all evil that could be mitigated? Say what?   I am not sure what you are talking about here?  Evil simply exists in the universe.  God utilizes evil to teach his children things.   Thats it.  God isnt interested in eradicating evil he is simply interested in educating his children so that he can promote some of them to Godhood.  Mormonism is about infinite increase not conquering evil.  gtAnd theres no evil in the Celestial Kingdom What?  The Celestial Kingdoms isnt a place in Mormon theology.  Its a rank.  You obtain the rank of God.  Why can God visit the lower kingdoms and Terestrial people cant visit higher kingdoms?  Because they dont have awesome God like powers that allow them to fly around the universe.  Evil not being able to be in the presence of God is obviously not true in Mormon theology its just a saying.  Satan obviously hangs out in heaven or used to. Evil is everywhere and always will be everywhere in Mormonism.   However God has the ability to promote people to different ranks.  God is simply taking souls and promoting them and educating them so that he can promote them again.  He isnt eradicating evil.  There will always be evil intelligence in the universe.   Mormon theology is so radically different to mainstream Christianity.  Its not about being saved its about ranking up.   All the salvation doctrine in Mormonism are just technicalities that God needs to solve  Jesus is a loophole in the universe our purpose isnt to serve God and Jesus its to become like them and then go do our own thing.  In heaven you arent hanging out with God anymore than you hang out with your parents when you move out of state after you become an adult and get a job.    You might visit but you dont live in the same place.  You go do your own thing.  God eventually stops being your God you become your own God.  Anyway my ideas are all over the place.

4273703,0,t1_cs7bid6,When I was a DL one of the elders in our district was a nice kid but seriously weird. He would do Beevis amp Butthead and Bill Clinton voices all the time sometimes having entire conversations between these voices all by himself and hed laugh to himself throughout the whole thing. He would even do this when nobody else was in the room with him. He was kind of in his own little world. Sometimes he would interject a totally inappropriate Bill Clinton impersonation into a conversation that had nothing to do with the quote he was using... He was just trying to squeeze into a conversation with something he thought was funny. Looking back I should have appreciated that guy more and felt sorry that he was abused by TSCC into serving a mission like the rest of us when he clearly didnt need to be out there. I should have reached out to him more.But one day I was running our district meeting and the ZLs were sitting in on it with us so I felt pressure for it to be good and spiritual. I asked Elder Beevis to read a scripture... One of the verses from Almas faith monolog.Elder Beevis got to the part about when you begin to feel a swelling motion in your breast or whatever the quote is and right after the word breast he did a little Buttheadstyle huhhuh laugh... And he did it so smoothly and went right back into the verse without missing a beat because that kind of thing was so normal for him. But the rest of us just busted up even though we were trying not to. I was totally embarrassed in front of the ZLs but at the same time I thought it was totally hilarious.I wonder where that kid is now. I hope hes living a happy life.,exmormon,cs7d4dm,12,t5_2r0gj

4277537,0,t1_cs7rsu4,Other than this subreddit I listen to Mormon Stories when a person or story looks interesting that is pretty much it. I didnt feel I needed much of support group when I first left I was happy to be out and didnt feel traumatized. Maybe the fact that I have spent so much of my life around nonmormons helped me through it.  My feelings toward spirituality are still murky I havent decided if I dodont believe in a higher power if there is a god I am not mad at him I do have some resentment towards organized religion. No emotional upanddown roller coaster for me that all happened while in mormonism once out it just felt right.  I wouldnt even say my wife found the mormon church to be a bunch of lies the best way I can describe mine and her exit is more spiritual if you will similar to how the mormon church brings you in search your heart feel the spirit etc. I think we both realized that we didnt want to be part of what TSCC stands for we realized a lot of the negativity the decision to leave brought us peace. Even though I left ish years before she did I was very cautious not to go stepping all over her beliefs much of what I learned concerning the lies and inaccuracies of the TSCC came in the last  years and I did not share that newfound knowledge with my wife no matter how badly I wanted to. One of the only things I shared with her before she completely made her decision she was already considering leaving was the Marisa Calderwood interview on Mormon Stories I also played her the first part of the Jeremy Runnells interview on the same podcast. She then read a little bit more about the Calderwoods before announcing she was out. Once she had done that I shared with her some of my thoughts doubts concerns questions shared some stories from my life and also had her listen to the rest of the Jeremy Runnells interview. She then listened to the Christine Jeppsen Clark interview on Mormon Stories and then she started looking up the LDS Essays that the church has been putting out.

Get him to have positive experiences outside of the LDS spiritual narrative You have to break down the guilt and fearHe thinks he made covenants. He thinks he has to take the sacrament. Ask him to show you where it says meet weekly. It just says meet often Build him up  outside of the church. Get him to pay tithing on a surplus  and to other charities. Christs Kingdom is the world. Not just LDS.  Help him build UP his spiritual side  but outside of the little box that is mormonism. If he feels he can go one on one with God  Jesus  then the stranglehold the church has on him is gone. Then  he Will be prepared to be critical and objective towards the church  then he will see  that he isnt losing by leaving the church  hes stepping CLOSER to Christ and God. Hes Peter in the boat.  You want to go to Jesus  get your feet wet  get uncomfortable  get OUT of the boat He needs to come to Jesus on gods  terms  not the correlation department terms. Then  when hes out   weeks later he will then start applying the same scrutiny to Christianity  and find out it doesnt hold up to close scrutiny either Baby steps  build him up during that time. Understand why he is staying.  Hes trying to be good Work with that  direct it elsewhere Let him feel God outside of the church.

Condition of Body decaying. Soul spinning around. Fortune unpredictable. Lasting Fame uncertain. Sum Up The body and its parts are a river the soul a dream and mist life is warfare and a journey far from home lasting reputation is oblivion.Then what can guide us?Only philosophy.Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault superior to pleasure and pain doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture not dependent on anyone elses doing something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And above all that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit as nothing but the dissolution of the elements from which each living thing is composed.

This in fact turns out not to be the case especially as you move up the IQ spectrum. In professions in which everyone is above average in IQ doctors lawyers engineers and so forth there is no relationship between intelligence and success because at that level other variables come into play that determine career outcomes ambition time allocation social skills networking luck and so on. Similarly when people encounter claims that they know little about which is most claims for most of us intelligence is usually not a factor in belief with one exception once people commit to a belief the smarter they are the better they are at rationalizing those beliefs. Thus smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons.Chapter  of Michael Shermers The Believing Brain,exmormon,cshd7ha,6,t5_2r0gj

4377541,0,t1_csj13zh,Who ever posts the Im a Mormon videos on Facebook or watches them or cares? The members. Outsiders generally do not notice or care. I would argue its purely a sideeffect if outsiders notice or are impressed by these actions  instead they are messages to the insiders to convince them the church is hip and relevant. I mean how do you and I know about the buses and billboards? Because the PR machine makes sure members know about it and share it with each other.The more subtle PR statements and essays are also aimed at insiders but only certain types  a younger demographic particularly the educated not to be looked at with a critical eye but to tell those inside that somebody smart has addressed the issue. Just take the essays  outsiders who see those are not fooled at all they are so clearly propaganda pieces. Nor would they fully understand so much of the jargon and the weaselwords. But insiders will take them as intended and most often be inoculated without reading more than a few sentences. And those inside who do read them more closely will either  probably leave anyway or  become amateur apologists like many on the other sub with talking points so that when they talk to exmos or especially outsiders who are unfamiliar with issues they will feel like they have intelligent answers and suffer less cognitive dissonance.The missionary program is the best example that all outside communications are really communications to insiders. Mission presidents and GAs are very upfront with missionaries that the main point is to convert the missionary and train him to be a good little Mormon and fall in line with leadership with conversion of nonMormons being a possible side benefit. I am convinced that all external communications by the church mirror this approach  they give the illusion of relevance to members by say sending an occasional apostle to an interfaith conference even though they are really not ecumenical and do not fully participate in the interfaith community its kind of hard to when you dont actually respect the other religions and keep trying to steal their members then make sure they tell the members about it via President Newsroom the report between conference sessions church magazines and namedropping in GC talks.,exmormon,csj31vl,1,t5_2r0gj

That might legalize polygamy though.

Heterosexual marriage is done by consenting adults. Homosexual marriage is also done by consenting adults. Paedophilia and bestiality are NOT done by consenting adults.  Incest can be done by consenting adults but it also results in mutant kids so unless they are willing to be sterilized its a bad idea.  says It Offends GodNot wearing a burka offends the Muslim god. Cutting your sideburns offends the Jewish god. Eating cows offends the Hindu god. Should we make laws about those too?

The Mormon version sure shouldnt get to make any rules since they represent less than  of the population. If Muslims one day become the majority in America are you okay with them enforcing Sharia Law? If its not okay for a Muslim to force you to live by their religions rules why is it fair for you to force other people to live by yours?Mufassa nonLDS As for  in that list it really bugged me and I have a short answer. If my God is offended by marriage equality or same sex marriage two people trying to have the same quality of life that I enjoy then he does not deserve to be my God. My God loves everyone no matter their sexual orientation.Mowgli TBM The Courts decision does not alter the Lords doctrine that marriage is a union between a man and a woman ordained by God. This was a decision by several unelected judges that reflects the views of a government but holds no significance to any religious denomination and will be treated as such.Sebastian OP  The views of a religion holds no significance to anyone outside of that religion and will be treated as such. Regarding the Lords doctrine his doctrine seems to be extremely inconsistent. According to the Lords doctrine marriage is...between a man and many women DampC between a man many wives and many concubines DampC between a man and one woman DampC between a woman and many men Joseph married at least  women who were already marriedDid you read all those quotes I posted from the early leaders of the church about the evils of monogamy? According to the founders of the church Monogamy or restrictions by law to one wife is no part of the economy of heaven among men.Here is what the early prophets and apostles had to say about the the Lords doctrine of marriage.THE ONLY MEN WHO BECOME GODS EVEN THE SONS OF GOD ARE THOSE WHO ENTER INTO POLYGAMY. Others attain unto a glory and may even be permitted to come into the presence of the Father and the Son but they cannot reign as kings in glory because they had blessings offered unto them and they refused to accept them. Prophet Brigham Young Journal of Discourses Vol  p. . I think no more of taking another wife than I do of buying a cow. Apostle Heber C. Kimball The Twenty Seventh Wife Irving Wallace p. .Now I want to PROPHESY a little. I want to PROPHESY that all men who oppose the revelation which God has given in relation to polygamy will find themselves in darkness the Spirit of God will withdraw from them the very moment of their opposition to that principle until they will finally go down to hell and be damned if they do not repent. if you do not become as dark as midnight there is no truth in Mormonism. Apostle Orson Pratt Journal of Discourses vol.  p.  If we were to do away with polygamy it would only be one feather in the bird one ordinance in the Church and kingdom. Do away with that then we must do away with prophets and Apostles with revelation and the gifts and graces of the Gospel and finally give up our religion altogether and turn sectarians and do as the world does then all would be right. We just cant do that for God has commanded us to build up His kingdom and to bear our testimony to the nations of the earth and we are going to do it come life or come death. He has told us to do thus and we shall obey Him in days to come as we have in days past Prophet Wilford Woodruff Journal of Discourses vol.  p.  We will not end the practice of plural marriage until the coming of the Son of Man.President Woodruff at the dedication of the Manti Temple. Journal of John Henry Smith  May  LDS Church ArchivesWhere did this COMMANDMENT come from in relation to polygamy? It also came from God. It was a REVELATION given unto Joseph Smith from God and was made binding upon His servants. When this system was first introduced among this people it was one of the greatest crosses that ever was taken up by any set of men since the world stood. Joseph Smith told others he told me and I can bear witness of it that if this principle was not introduced this Church and kingdom could not proceed. When this commandment was given it was so far religious and so far binding upon the Elders of this Church that it was told them if they were not prepared to enter into it and to stem the torrent of opposition that would come in consequence of it the keys of the kingdom would be taken from them. When I see any of our people men or women opposing a principle of this kind I have years ago set them down as on the high road to apostasy and I do today I consider them apostates and not interested in this Church and kingdom. I Remarks by Elder John Taylor made in the Tabernacle Journal of Discourses Vol  p.  Now hear it O inhabitants of the earth Jew and Gentile Saint and Sinner! When OUR FATHER ADAM came into the garden of Eden he came into it with a celestial body and brought Eve ONE OF HIS WIVES WITH HIM. Prophet Brigham Young Journal of Discourses Vol.  p.  Now if any of you will deny the plurality of wives and continue to do so I promise that you will be damned. Prophet Brigham Young A Discourse delivered in the Tabernacle. Journal of Discourses Vol.  p.  Some quietly listen to those who speak against the plurality of wives and against almost every principle that God has revealed. Such persons have halfadozen devils with them all the time. You might as well deny Mormonism and turn away from it as to oppose the plurality of wives. Let the Presidency of this Church and the Twelve Apostles and all the authorities unite and say with one voice that they will oppose the doctrine and the whole of them will be damned. Apostle Heber C. Kimball Journal of Discourses vol.  p. It would be as easy for the United States to build a tower to remove the sun as to remove polygamy or the Church and kingdom of God. Millennial Star vol.  p.principle of plurality of wives never will be done away Deseret News Nov.  There are many more similar quotes but this message is already too long.The doctrine of the LDS church has changed so many times that it cant be taken seriously. The current LDS church barely even resembles the one that Joseph Smith founded. If you want that youll need to join the FLDS church. Todays prophets are disavowing things said by earlier prophets even though the original prophets claimed it was the word of god and revelation the scriptures are still being revised to this day and the church is finally admitting to many of the things they labelled as antimormom lies for the past  years. I dont know if youre familiar with the essays the church has been quietly releasing over the past year but you should definitely check them out. There are links to all of them on www.MormonEssays.com. All the links take you directly to LDS.org. They are still whitewashed and missing important facts but at least they arent completely denying things anymore. Things that were once claimed to be doctrine revelation and the word of the Lord are now dismissed denied and swept under the rug. So the . of the world that isnt Mormon has no reason to take anything they say seriously.Mowgli TBM Im not not sure how we ended up on plural marriage which is consistent with scripture and still a union between a man and a woman but debating this subject seems pointless as we will never agrees.Arial Liberal Mormon This is about the federal government finally allowing same sex couples the rights and protections of marriage that we have. They can now receive survivor benefits from social security. File jointly on federal taxes have a durable will and countless other rights that they had been denied for so long. This isnt about getting married in churches this about being recognized by the government.Belle TBM Will you also succor the rights of Christians when their rights are taken away?Arial Liberal Mormon No will not. This didnt take away any rights. This gave rights to more of our fellow americans.Belle TBM We shall see?Sebastian OP Belle Im not sure who your question was directed at. I would absolutely succor the rights of Christians if they were being taken away but I have yet to see that happen....,exmormon,csn79hn,7,t5_2r0gj

Its not ethical in this era to encourage another person by any means to accept a particular worldview as the only valid way to think. If we talk about unethical influence as brainwashing it becomes something to ridicule that we could never be capable of but the reality is that it is very easy for any human to fall into a mode of pushing their ideas onto others forcefully and manipulatively.

4572800,0,t3_3dndte,Its easy enough to tear apart Mormonism using their own material.  You dont need outside books to do it.  Just stick to their own books and sayings by their own prophets.  And dont preach at them or let them preach to you.  Ask them questions and let them figure out the truth on their own.  Is it true the church owns the mall?  I heard that the other day and Im having a hard time wrapping my head around that.  If the LDS temple is a restoration of the Jewish temple why are none of the ceremonies the same?  Im having a hard time finding out.  If Mormonism is the same as Christianity then why is a temple recommend necessary to get into heaven?  The Bible never mentions it.  In fact the Bible says Jesus is the way the truth and the life.  Im having a hard time understanding why Jesus never talked about that.  etc. Theyll have to do research and they might just find the truth in the process.,exmormon,ct70etr,2,t5_2r0gj
4574088,0,t3_3dmjyz,well explained by the comments it can also be seen by skeptics as a mechanism where the church can surreptitiously change policy and direct doctrine using a thirdparty and then if things dont work out they can deny it was ever an official church policy or doctrine and can distance it from the Prophet Seer and Revelator. Previously the Office of the First Presidency would send out official statements and that has come back to haunt them e.g. interracial marriage evolution etc,exmormon,ct768bg,1,t5_2r0gj

Its nearly eleven years later and I still feel the pain every day but I can promise you that time will progressively heal your heart.

4580472,0,t3_3dr2ex,Im afraid that youll find AA to be too similar to going to Mormon church to be able to internalize and trust it. There is a lot of dogma that is socially reinforced. You can even have a sponsor regularly check up on you. If youve ever had a bishop do similar for tempations then youll feel similarly. Im afraid that curing your drinking problem in this way will remind you too much of what youre trying to escape in the first place.That said DO try to do something. Anything. Maybe AA this week maybe you springboard into mental health counseling next week. I personally am working on my own drinking problem using selfhelp books and focused introspection. I dont recommend you flying solo like Im trying to but I will recommend you read the following books as you work on your drinking no matter what path you choose Allen Carr  Easy Way to Control Drinking sounds gimmicky but it presents very logical and intuitive reasoning about alcohol thats meant to change the way you think about drinking. William James  Talks For Teachers has a lot of information on concepts such as perception and free will that actually formed the basis of American psychology. Noah Elkrief  A Guide to the Present Moment I just began reading it I suggest foraying into Buddhism and meditation as alternative to the end that you seek via drinking.Thoughts beget actions and actions beget thoughts. I suggest you create two goals for yourself think about drinking like healthy drinkers do and drink like healthy drinkers do. Be realistic about what you can expect from drinking before you begin and drink an appropriate amount in an appropriate setting. Hopefully you can learn how to have a few drinks without going overboard. If not you should be prepared to give it up entirely. Compared to everything else life has to offer you wouldnt be missing out on much.If you ever need someone to talk to PM me. My drinking habits also involved being stubborn after legal trouble and drinking until I cant anymore alcohol is all gone or Im passed out. Im still a work in progress but Im in a much better place than I was a few months ago.,exmormon,ct7z0lf,1,t5_2r0gj

The control granted to men the gilded cage subservience of women.  The inability to openly discuss issues within the confines of a very strict religious structure that affects behaviors across the spectrum...

4663277,0,t3_3et3ya,Questions to ask him How would a religion led by Jesus Christ behave in regards to racism segregation and equality? If one of the main differentiating factors between Mormonism and other religions is a living prophet and a church led by revelation why did it get this so wrong and so late? Considering the pressure on BYU the temple being announced in Brazil Brazil is nearly  black and general criticism of Mormonism at the time on this issue wasnt the revelation remarkably convenient?  Why were some black people given the priesthood during Joseph Smiths time? Can you point me to the revelation that Brigham Young had to block black people from the priesthood and the temple in the first place? Is it possible that Brigham Young and some of his successors were simply racist considering their words and actions? How would you feel considering how incessantly the church talks and lessons focus on eternal families if you were blocked from going to the temple to get sealed because of your eye color finger length or some other physical feature you had no control over? DampC  says ...But when we undertake to cover our sins or to gratify our pride our vain ambition or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men in any degree of unrighteousness behold the heavens withdraw themselves the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and when it is withdrawn Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man. If Brigham Young and successive leaders instituted an unrighteous racist policy upon church members what would that say about their priesthood authority? Why was Byron Marchant excommunicated in  only one year before the policy change for voicing his opinion against the ban?  Has the church ever actually explained why the ban occurred or apologized for it? The closest they could come was to disavow past theories taught as fact by top church leaders themselves.

4679815,0,t3_3f1kqk,Very nice. Here are a few other quotes from nonLDS folks from my paper on the Book of AbrahamSmith would tell visitors that the papyri contained Abrahams signature. In April  Josiah Quincy Jr. whose father was president of Harvard University and a former member of the US House of Representatives and Charles Francis Adams son of John Quincy Adams who was the sixth President of the United States visited Smith while traveling. Smith showed Quincy and Adams the papyri and Quincy wrotegtSome parchments inscribed with hieroglyphics were then offered us. They were preserved under glass and handled with great respect. That is the handwriting of Abraham the Father of the Faithful said the prophet.Adams similarly wrotegtHe then took us down into his mothers chamber and showed us four Egyptian mummies stripped and then undertook to explain the contents of a chart or manuscript which he said had been taken from the bosom of one of them. The cool impudence of this imposture amused me very much. This said he was written by the hand of Abraham and means so and so. If anyone denies it let him prove the contrary. I say it is. Of course we were too polite to prove the negative against a man fortified by revelation.Another one of Smiths visitors had a similar experience and wrotegtHe then walked to a secretary on the opposite side of the room and drew out several frames covered with glass under which were numerous fragments of Egyptian papyrus on which as usual a great variety of hieroglyphical characters had been imprinted. These ancient records said he throw great light upon the subject of Christianity. They have been unrolled and preserved with great labour and care. My time has hitherto been too much taken up to translate the whole of them but I will show you how I interpret certain parts. There said he pointing to a particular character that is the signature of the patriarch Abraham. It is indeed a most interesting autograph I replied and doubtless the only one extant.  What an ornament it would be to have these ancient manuscripts handsomely set in appropriate frames and hung up around the walls of the temple which you are about to erect in this place. Yes replied the prophet and the translation hung up with them.,exmormon,ctkfs8a,13,t5_2r0gj

4730078,0,t3_3fo23f,tldr Swear words are often used in insulting others and are focused on the baser aspects of our bodies.  The kind of  language we use is a reflection of the humanity we are willing to acknowledge in ourselves and others.warning lots of explicit languageSwear words are often used in insulting others.  mother fucker theres a lot of debate as to its actual meaning but for its first century of use this was not considered a compliment.  son of a bitch meaning you are a bastard child piece of shit self explanatory God damned they should be sent to hell and burn forever.Then we have euphemisms for body parts such as ass dick pussy or cunt.  In every case to be called one of these is considered to be derogatory.So the question is why do these words elicit such a negative response?  Why these words and not other words?  Why doesnt it sound or feel as derogatory to be called a sillyhead instead of a dickhead?I think the reason is primarily because commonly used swear wordsphrases reduce an individual down to being merely a bag of useless or foul molecules or genitalia  poignant reminders of the fact that we are indeed animals and made of a just so many molecules.However humanism in its most inclusive sense is built upon the idea that each human has value beyond being a mere animal a fucking machine sotospeak or mere collection of molecules.  We are each selfreflective selfdirecting selfconcious rational feeling beings.  By virtue of possessing these properties we ought to respect one another as creatures of worth beyond our chemistry or mere biology.Our language then is a reflection of how much humanity we are willing to acknowledge in ourselves and in others are they merely a mother fucker so to speak?  A son of a bitch?  Are they merely a dick or an ass?  Or are they a person with intrinsic value that goes beyond the fact that they shit vile waste twice a day?Wait what about just saying swear words?  What if youre not calling someone that thing?  Well why not relieve yourself in public?  Why not jack off in front of your grandmother while shes watching TV?  These are normal biological processes.  You say that swear words are just words and that is true.  But feces is just ruffage mixed with bacteria and semen is just protein DNA and mucous.  Whats the big problem?  Its just molecules.  Why the inhibition?  Aside from the evolutionary benefit derived from seeking to relieve ourselves away from the herd the fact that we do these things in private is an acknowledgement that we are human i.e. not merely animalshence we engage in ways with one another that respect our rational selves and downplay our biological selves to some extent.That acknowledgement of our humanity is a good thing in my opinion.  Hence while I personally couldnt really care less when people swear around me I choose to use language that is ennobling to humanity and doesnt seek to reduce us down to a bunch of fuckers or sexually reproductive machines.So for this primary reason I think its great to encourage others including children to use ennobling language.  I encourage my children to avoid profanity and I avoid using it myself obviously this comment is a major exception mostly out of a sense of respect for myself and those around me.,exmormon,ctqrnkq,3,t5_2r0gj

How many people believe in crazy things or participate in ridiculous religious practices because of this need? How do things like the Holocaust or slavery happen? Its terrifying to be that one person to stand up and say this is wrong! when everyone around you is doing it. It even applies to exmormons. Once I learned I was not alone in this it made it so much easier to be honest about what I believe to be true.

What does that look like exactly?  One who is wellinformed enough to know that all of the testable claims of Mormonism are false and that the subjective claims are untestable seems to be in a position of pretending rather than peace.One would have to so embrace fideism as to have no moral qualms proclaiming a victorious orthodoxy in the face of empirical contradiction when discussing whats objective and whats subjective empirically.Its not the books and the troubling unknown issues that make Mormonism inherently false as a proposition its the specious reasoning and the poor epistemology.,exmormon,cu1sewg,3,t5_2r0gj

We started chatting over msn messenger for like  hours and then on the phone for like an hour or so. She seemed nice and normal by Mormon standards at any rate and we flirted a little. So next day at the district conference and we met and straight away she was all over me like Joe Smith on Fanny Alger in a barn. Also she was introducing me to her branch members as her future eternal companion and planning to move to where I lived for us to be together. After  hours chatting. Oh and she was what we in Australia call a bush pig.Now Im not so shallow as to judge someones attractiveness on thier physical appearance but I do however hold ideas about how basic personal hygiene influences how attractive someone is and this chick scored about . on that one. Lets just say she had a mouth that made gollum look like a model for dental hygiene. Anyway I hinted to here that I wasnt really interested in any kind of relationship but she didnt get the hint and called me every morning about am for like a weekend before I finally told her that I wasnt dumping her and she was like its the long distance relationship isnt it? I understand and that was that...Fast forward  months and Im visiting friends in the town she was from and run into her at the store and shes living with a guy and is  months pregnant with his kid. She tells me that she still has deep feelings for me and I was her best ever boyfriend and if I wanted her to shed leave the father of her unborn baby for me and move in with me. Luckily my female friend she knew about the crazy I was with pretended to be my girlfriend and that was enough to scare her off.Fun times fun times,exmormon,cu3sw4a,2,t5_2r0gj

For many Conference is a time for brunch napping and just generally lounging about while the TV is on in the background.

This was a quick decision but one that I absolutely did not take lightly.It all comes down to Joseph Smith in my opinion.  If he wasnt the man that he professed if his accounts of visions and miracles dont add up if his gift of translation not only produced wrong information but the entire church history narrative of the method of that translation was not only falsely taught but purposefully hidden until it could not be hidden any longer  then the whole house of cards tumbles down.Im struggling with viewing anything related to God as truth right now because Ive always seen it through the lens of mormonism.  The mormon church does teach good sound principles but if you strip away everything comes from Joseph Smith there is nothing unique left.  Everything else comes down to Common Decency and Common Sense.  Or in other words being a human being.  Joseph Smith didnt divine the golden rule.,exmormon,cu75mp6,11,t5_2r0gj

I think its wrong to try to come up with a geography in Josephs back yard that maps directly to the Book of Mormon.

4934497,0,t1_cugdt0w,gt The Church has always welcomed all boys to its Scouting units regardless of sexual orientation church spokesman Eric Hawkins said in a prepared statement. However the admission of openly gay leaders is inconsistent with the doctrines of the church and what have traditionally been the values of the Boy Scouts of America.By what logic? What principle is this spokesman pulling out of thin air to justify accepting gay children into scouting but not gay adults as leaders? Is there some alchemy that transforms a perfectly wholesome boy scout who happens to be gay into a craven sinbeast as an adult?The ONLY explanation I can think of is that they still believe behind the scenes that people are gay because they were preyed upon as children and are thus invariably predators themselves. Theres an equation of pedophilia and being gay between the lines of what the spokesman is quite pointedly not saying.

How do you know the church isnt breaking even on operating expenses on a yearly basis?Let me give you a hypothetical with no facts to back this up similar to most of the opinions on this thread to demonstrate a simple financial principle.Lets say the church brings in b per year. Of that b goes towards mandatory operating expenses remember I dont know this is correct Im just advocating an alternate scenario that COULD be true.So we have b per year to use for discretionary spending. Some of this goes towards funding missions some goes towards humanitarian aid some goes towards funding misguided campaigns like prop . You get the idea. Instead of giving ALL of the excess to the poor the church sets aside some funds for forprofit ventures and investments. Over the years the church accumulates a b war chest of forprofit businessesinvestments generating  per year. Thats .b per year. In order to not dilute the principal amount due to inflation the church reinvests  of the  return or   b  .b into something like say a mall. The church is now left with b of excess cash flow NOT generated by tithing donations in the year in question but from investments. So now the church has created a vehicle wherein cash is being generated IN ADDITION to the tithing donations. If all tithing donations stop the church still has cash flow into perpetuity that keeps up with inflation.Now Im not saying theyre doing something similar to this. But this doesnt seem like a dumb way to run a church whos primary tithe paying base is getting ready to retire. Theyre preparing for a rainy day. Theyre managing their money effectively.

One is that spiritual phenomenon are generated by an individuals liver or bones or blood or lymphatic system.The other posits that the brain is essentially an antennae which receives signals from some spiritual source e.g. via some quantum signalling process etc.. I dont know of any respected neuroscientist which believes this hypothesis presents an accurate view of spiritual phenomenon.There is no evidence for such a belief. All attempts to explain phenomenon consistent with such a belief have been rebutted. Also neuroscience has advanced to the point where the biological and organizational structure of the brain is understood. At the same time we have strong evidence of ways in which spiritual experiences can be created by chemicals and other practices  And there is no evidence for the antenna hypothesis there are no brain structures which serve that purpose in human or animal there are no detectable signals etc. In cases like this I think that absence of evidence is evidence for absence Yes there are gaps. Yes we need more evidence and study of the brain and spiritual phenomenon.

They had two more children and her sister basically her mom that raised her passed away when she was .  Her sisters dying wish was for her to marry her BIL who was essentially her father figure.  Messed up.  So she does and has a child with him at .  At  her BILnow husband dies and she moves across with plains with the mormon pioneers as a single mom of  kids.  I have huge respect for her.  Once they got to Salt Lake she became the third wife of Stephen Markham Joseph Smiths body guard and whos cane was used to beat the muskets out of the door in carthage.  They settled Spanish Fork.  Interestingly Stephens first wife left him and continued on to California.  I would love to find a journal from her or her daughter that I descended from.  I only knew about Stephen Markham as he was our Mormon heritage celebrity growing up.  I never knew about Mary and all her trials.  I didnt find out about her until I was YW President and we were asked to share ancestor stories as preparation for Trek.  Her story haunts me and was definitely a contributing factor in me leaving the church.  Of course my family seems to think her situation is completely unremarkable and must have been normal for the times.  ,exmormon,cuuseom,2,t5_2r0gj

As a side note its funny how FAIR attempts to dismiss this former apostles talk to teachers of religion on the college level in the footnote by saying This address is not available at the BYU Speeches web site. The text is perhaps not surprisingly available on various antiMormon web sites. Its absence from the BYU site would seem to suggest that the Church disavows the concepts taught in this address.

Creating worlds and spirit babies sounds great on the surface but if you really contemplate eternity I mean REALLY think about it it all starts to fall apart. So youve been creating worlds and spirit children for a  trillion years and guess what it isnt even a SECOND in eternity! I would imagine that anything you do even creating worlds would get really old after a few hundred thousand years let alone a million trillion years. It wouldnt even take a few hundred thousand years before you literally start losing your mind from boredom and from doing the same thing over and over. Eventually youd be begging God to please just let you be done. It also wouldnt take very long before you would be able to anticipate every word thought and action of your eternal companions and family members. Everyone would be robots.

5353142,0,t3_3oc69w,If you just left the Mormon church and didnt attend any other religion thats essentially an admission on your part that all religions are untrue. Thats not really a blow to your spouses ego because it puts his beliefs on an even field with all the other religions.If you leave the Mormon church and join another religion its as though your stating that the new religion is better than Mormonism  which is what your husband has sank a probably notinsignificant number of hours into. In essence from his point of view youve repudiated hours of blood and sweat on his part in favor of some guy at a pulpit she doesnt really know.So hes upset. And it likely will be a wedge issue if you both take it seriously.My recommendation would to be to let the repercussions of one big decision that of leaving the Mormon church shake themselves out before possibly making another big decision that of joining another church. Id also recommend that you offer assurances however that works in your relationship that youre not going to begin drinking smoking etc.In the meantime Id work on finding him a happy way out of the church. For as patriarchal as the church is men like your husband realize no benefit  theyre not getting paid for their work and really have little control over other matters. He is faced on the one hand with the emptiness of sitting alone in a pew or on the other with acknowledging that hes spent irretrievable time working to no good end.

5421739,0,t3_3pargm,There is no possible way the church will be able to survive with its current approach. Even TBMs are uncomfortable with at least SOMETHING and they dont like being told that their doubts dont have validity. The internet exists and being told not to read truths even on the churchs sites doesnt sit well with honest people. It is becoming increasingly difficult for out of touch ancient rich white Utahns to control an increasingly diverse membership. The rhetoric directed at women is becoming a problem as well since there is such an increase in divorce even in LDS households that requires former stay at home moms to work outside the home  thus becoming aware of how many opportunities they have for growth...not the other way around. Even my most pious friends and family members have begun slow fades. Recently I attended my older TBM sisters wedding and by that I mean I was the telestial babysitter and for the first time my CRAZYTBM mom and her equally stalwart sisters realized that they no longer have any power. Out of all of their kids they each have only one child who still believes. The rest are all out  and are all successfully independent hardworking honest helpful apostates. I dont expect that my mom will be LDS when she dies. ,exmormon,cw4on0s,16,t5_2r0gj

I didnt know that I had a clitoris and I certainly didnt know that women could masturbate. Then I had a good friend get married. When she couldnt achieve orgasms she went to a therapist who had her read a book about womens orgasm I think it was called just that Womens Orgasm. I borrowed it and read it even though I wasnt married. The author recommended masturbation and suggested many ways to do it. Back when I was a TBM the Mormon church didnt make much of a fuss about girls and masturbation. So I tried the exercises in the book.I dont think I even thought it was wrong for a girl to do. I dont remember ever having an MIA lecture about it. I remember only a couple times being asked by a bishop about it. The first time the fish asked if I stimulated myself. I didnt figure out what he was talking about until after Id left the meeting when a friend explained the question to me. I thought he was asking whether I read good books and did cultural sorts of things like going to the symphony and ballet. Anyway its perfectly normal and good to masturbate.

5437104,0,t3_3pimdc,Couple of thoughts here.  You may be overthinking this one a bit.  Expecting every film to fit in with your personal worldview whether it be agnostic atheist Mormon or Buddhist is going to severely dilute your enjoyment of films.  While I personally dont enjoy films that are overly religious read preachy I have no problem with the concept of religion or religiouslike elements in a film..  Star Wars is not true Science Fiction.  Its more of a space opera with some fantasy and science fiction concepts thrown in. As an agnostic who doesnt believe in miracles or magic I can certainly enjoy Lord of the Rings and similar works even though I dont believe any of that is real or possible..  Finally remember its a MOVIE its meant to entertain.  Ive never seen any of the previous films get preachy about religious concepts.  Ive always seen the force as a sciencebased concept as in within the context of the story the existence of The Force is fairly falsifiable.  Relax enjoy the movie accept that you live in a world where religion and its concepts are part of the zeitgeist and make the movie yours.,exmormon,cw6n77x,8,t5_2r0gj

5439344,0,t3_3pjbjc,JS  I posted my a link to my Initial Doubts story but the final straw for me that happened in the last few months was pretty ugly and left me no desire to ever go back.Heres what happened.  For my familys sake I was hoping to middleoftheroad it as a NOM.  At first the bishop was cool with that but over time put more and more pressure for me to take teaching callings and to HT.  I told him I couldnt in good conscience as I had some extreme doubts on the truthfulness of many things being taught and that in many cases they appeared to be lies of omission.  Up to that point the bishop told me over and over there is no sin in doubt and that whatever we spoke of would stay right there in that room. He began to lean on me harder to take a calling and demanded I write up a list of my doubts.  I was also waiting for his decision as to whether I could ordain my own son a deacon.   At the last moment he told me I could not.  My son was devastated and cried to me and was angry at the church as well.  I am not trying to blow my own horn but I am a good loving dad and very close this this son as I raised him from a baby when my wife worked and I was home during the day.  I also had to open up a bit to my father so he could drive out and do the ordination.  My wife and I have been on the edge of divorce over and over since that day. It was VERY UGLY and I was quite angry that they hurt my son nearly caused a divorce AND tried to use my family to bully me and to manipulate me to do something I was not comfortable doing.Again the bishop insisted I make a list of my doubts and me being so angry at this point and no longer caring I did it!  It ended up being like a very sarcastic and snarky mini CES letter which at that point I still hadnt read. To top it off I got a call from the stake somewhat condescending insisting I come in and speak with them.  So much for keeping my doubts in that room bishop lied... surprise surprise They would not tell me what it was about.  I was still pissed of and came totally unglued and yelled at the poor guy from the stake.  He backed right down when he realized I would come through the phone and choke him if I could.  Then I slammed down my old s desk phone and hung up on him.  Just retelling this story makes me angry.  Supposedly our new HTs want to invite me and my family over to eat but I am not sure I should do it yet.  Even as a doubting member I never considered the church a cult but my experience since then tells me it is very much a cult.  No leaders will talk to me now as they know I am a hairtrigger ready to explode at the drop of a hat.  The funny thing is I am really like that but this whole experience has somehow traumatized me to where I randomly blow up in regards to church stuff.  ,exmormon,cw6xgzl,1,t5_2r0gj

A big crux in Mormonism is that were the one true church which as a process of elimination must mean that every church out there is false. Thus you are allowed to research other religions and find flaws in their arguments and doctrine just dont do it to the one true church.I argued and debated with Christians a lot on my mission and found so many flaws I remember telling my companion that if I wasnt Mormon I would be an atheist. It turns out I was right. There was a brief time I attended some nondenominational Christian activities with one of my Christian friends while I was leaving Mormonism but that was rather short lived as it seemed more like a social club sprinkled with Jesus here and there.Basically once you learn to think objectively about your own beliefs despite your cognitive biases its rather easy to think objectively about others beliefs because you have much less biases toward them.,exmormon,cwmmvnc,6,t5_2r0gj

Now that everyones records are all digitized and available via the church website or the LDS Tools app they could totally randomize the new names and just add it to your membership record in a way that individuals cant see their own but temple workers could still pull them up. This would make the names feel more like a mission call... Some special revelatory thing that assigned that specific name to you and only God knows why. Back in the early days all men had the same name and all women had another name AbrahamSarah I think? so the idea that your name is a super secret special thing that has any kind of personal connection to you is a cultural artifact of how the ceremony has evolved over the years. They could increase that feeling of super specialness by the modernized process I mentioned above and most of the rising generation would never know the process used to be so generic and uninspired.,exmormon,cwpvzll,1,t5_2r0gj

He also wakes up most nights hysterical with tears and screams because he already believes that he is an apostate for his inability to control his same sex attraction. His is the worst life I could image and it breaks my heart to see him so I usually dont. I live out of state and I dont call him and our interactions are limited when Im in town.

Thats why atheists tend to have such a problem with religions because they look objectively at what it claims to represent then they see the blatant hypocracies with those claiming to advocate for whatever religion and it pisses them off that people use a religion to justify being a generally shitty person.

I wept reading that book finally encountering voices which in some way mirrored my own experience. I read it over and over.

Blessings can be efficacious for depression but you should still take your meds or get professional help.  They can seem to help for the flu or other low level illnesses but you should still get proper rest have a bowl of soup use Nyquil and get a flu vaccination.  People with cancer and other serious health problems get priesthood blessings but we would consider skipping medical treatment like chemotherapy to be crazy and negligent.

In the same way an Elders Quorum President also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side. But a certain apostate as he traveled came where he was. When he saw him he was moved with compassion came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

Sure there are a few LDS shitsandwich comments every now and again but usually when she is not around.  A few of us have told her and she said not to worry about it that she doesnt care and loves to come visit the family.  So in other words my big worry is your partner.  If he is going to all of a sudden retrench in and go full follow the prophet mode then I would agree with others just end it now and avoid more pain later on.For those of us that still have a TBM spouse we can tell you it is THE HARDEST thing we have ever dealt with.  Many if not most just end in divorce anyway. You know what I would do?  Make him read this whole damn thread and see how he responds.  If he goes into a defensive stance then just look for a graceful exit.  If he sees it from your point of view and assures that his family and ties to Mormonism will not be a hindrance to both your relationship and freedom then maybe you can go with it but keep your eyes open and look to geographically distance yourself from his family as soon as possible. ,exmormon,cxbic0q,1,t5_2r0gj

5838778,0,t3_3v5wtp,In her  interview with W. Wyl Sarah Pratt alleged that Joseph Smith allowed Bennett a medical doctor to perform abortions on Smiths polygamous wives who were officially single. In a public charge that was likely true according to author Andrew Smith Bennett was accused by many of performing abortions including Hyrum Smith Zeruiah Goddard claimed Bennett told Sarah Pratt that he could cause abortion with perfect safety to the mother at any stage of pregnancy and that he had frequently destroyed and removed infants before their time to prevent exposure of the parties and that he had instruments for that purpose. If the women refused Bennett stated that he came with Josephs approval. Sarah Pratt herself recounted an incident in whichBennett was en route to do a little job for Joseph because one of his women was in trouble. Saying this he took out a pretty long instrument of a kind I had never seen before. It seemed to be of steel and was crooked at one end. I heard afterwards that the operation had been performed that the woman was very sick and that Joseph was very much afraid that she might die but she recovered.Pratt also related her observations of Bennetts work for Joseph Smith to Smiths son Joseph Smith IIII saw that he was not inclined to believe the truth about his father so I said to him You pretend to have revelations from the Lord. Why dont you ask the Lord to tell you what kind of a man your father really was? He answered If my father had so many connections with women where is the progeny? I said to him Your father had mostly intercourse with married women and as to single ones Dr. Bennett was always on hand when anything happened.However Smith IIIs own published account differed from Pratts recollectionDid he ever at such times or at any other time or place make improper overtures to you or proposals of an improper naturebegging your pardon for the apparent indelicacy of this question? To this Mrs. Pratt replied quietly but firmly No Joseph your father never said an improper word to me in his life. He knew better. Sister Pratt it has been frequently told that he behaved improperly in your presence and I have been told that I dare not come to you and ask you about your relations with him for fear you would tell me things which would be unwelcome to me. You need have no such fear she repeated. Your father was never guilty of an action or proposal of an improper nature in my house towards me or in my presence at any time or place. There is no truth in the reports that have been circulated about him in this regard. He was always the Christian gentleman and a noble man.Sarah Pratt is my homegirl.ETA Yes it appears that there is some inconsistency here between what she said while Joseph Smith was alive and after her death. Even without the Joseph Smith narcissist nonsense Sarah Pratt will forever be my homegirl for her saying There are only two kinds of Mormon women devils and fools and raising twelve kids to be closet nonMos in early Utah. wt,exmormon,cxkzof5,2,t5_2r0gj

5858399,0,t3_3vhc69,You seem to be generalizing based on your experience but I think I know of the phenomenon you are going for.People call it Peter Pan syndrome.Many Mormon mothers want to shelter their boys and have them be as children until they are supposed to go on a mission faithfully serve and then come home get temple married flip the switch to masculine adulthood and start pumping out babies as a worthy templesealed adult. They dont want them to slip up and have anything to do with sins of a sexual nature or any other lesser sins.They want their boys to grow up as good obedient and ultrarespectful of their moms and all other girls. This leads to some Mormon boys stuck in an infantile state in their attitudes and actions towards women. They are also used to having moms and other girlswomen do things for them so they dont have to grow up.The moms want them to be nice boys so they put a higher percentage than the normal population in dance and theatre play piano or some other nonguitar instrument or have them take HomeEc to prepare for a mission etc. Some of those Mormon moms just cant handle the thought of rough and tumble activities and dont want their precious snowflake to get hurt or develop coarse habits or attitudes towards women. As a result many Mormon men dont develop masculine selfimages.Sure there are still plenty of Mormons who are into all kinds of sports and other masculine activities in addition to some of the above.But ultimately Mormon moms want their boys to be as little children until its time to flip the switch and instantly act like and be a man. Many Mormon boys cannot do this so they may seem more feminine because they are stuck in that infantilized mindset. And Peter Pan is often played by a female lead except for that hilarious commercial out right now... Might be a bit rambling in this post ...,exmormon,cxnkckv,74,t5_2r0gj

I continued to schedule the hymns with my organists and the guy who did the program so I didnt leave them in a bind. But the Bpric decided to wait me out. On the fifth Sunday I wasnt at church and I hear they had to scramble. I havent been back since and have since resigned.Im relating this because the leaders will try to not find a replacement for the calling then try to keep you doing it just a little while longer while they find a replacement. They will ask why youre quitting it and everything else. The trick is to avoid all that. Do not be there on the Sunday after you quit. In fact even if you intend to continue going to church I would skip the following month to make sure they wont just depend on substitutes. And practice saying I have personal reasons or even I have health reasons if you want to go that far.The thing is that getting people to accept callings in the Mormon church can be like pulling teeth. If you happen to be in a ward where you were the easiest pianist to get to accept a calling they are gonna really really really want you to not resign the calling because getting anyone else to do the job will be worse for them.,exmormon,cxorw3q,15,t5_2r0gj

Satan began as the adversarial concept to the Jews then played a few different roles then picked up the devil title and became a famous fallen angel and later a premortal man in Mormonism.Most of his role probably stems from Christians needing someone to blame so the devil takes the blame and jebus takes the punishment.coupl links for more info,exmormon,cxtmzpj,6,t5_2r0gj

So much fear will cause the mind to push away the idea that your preconceived belief which youve dedicated so much to could be wrong.

I realized then that I just hadnt been exposed to much yet and that the BOM truly was a minor feat in literature.  I felt a bit ridiculous for believing the impossibility of a young guy coming up with all that in light of other much more amazing works in the world.

This is a big transition and if nothing else a good counselor will make sure you are both heard.  This can be huge.  Next thing I would advise is to be the best husband you can be.  Do not let your faith transition end up being one of many things.  His Needs Her Needs is a great book as is The  Love Languages.  My experience is that I was a dope of a husband at  and many guys I know are.  If you are twice as good as I was you still need a lot of help.    These books are great ways to start exploring what makes a marriage tick. although His Needs Her Needs has some dated gender stereotyping.  Make sure you are practicing reflective listening.  For example if she says I dont know what she did to deserve this. you might say I know I never saw this coming either.  This must be really scary for you.

5926108,0,t3_3wikew,This hits close to home for me.  As a kidteenager both of my parents sang in the choir.  They were in it for the year limit.  They travelled all the time for this and considered it their mission as adults.  I remember distinctly using their choir membership as a badge of honor it was supposedly something very special.  The reality is the choir took them away from their family for an enormous amount of time.  All they ever talked about was the freaking MoTab and their next concert.  They travelled the world but always left their kids home.  They were gone most Sundays so we had to get ourselves to church.  They were gone  nights a week for practice so we didnt see them at all during that time.  The reality behind the choir is it is just one more way the church keeps busy.  They are so busy that they dont have time to question anything.  Add to that the prestige of being in the choir and the Frisson reactions associated with music and you end up with very VERY devout TBMs.  My parents have been out of the choir for years but my mom still constantly talks about it.

I just went through the motions. Looking back I think it would have been best to take a break from college or at least scale back a lot and focus on getting academic and psychological counseling.I came through the other side alive and had an epiphany that has served me well. I think its universal but it may not be The secret to getting out of a dark rut is to focus on giving delight in the present. Giving delight to anyone and everyone including yourself often. Forget about having everything figured out. If youll ever have a successful relationship. If youll find a career that youll love. What the meaning of life is. None of this matters. Its all in the future and so much is possible and could change unexpectedly that it does no good to try to chart your life with the end already certain. Loosen your grip on needing certainty.Love yourself more than you have ever loved anyone else. Treat yourself better than you have ever treated someone you respect. Make achievable short and midterm goals but dont get caught up in trying to define where exactly youll be in the long term.Be a giver and be real in every social context youre in and you cant go wrong.Get at least two people in your life that you can share absolutely anything with and both talk about the important things and build each other up. A sibling friend or some older mentor that you can talk to face to face at least once per week. Vulnerability about these things is half the battle.Get professional quality help.

Its sad to me that your Bishop while he wasnt rude or accusatory still made it sound as though you were the one that had sinned. You were the victim in this. I also was a victim of incest and struggled throughout my teens and early s with eating disorders depression cutting and promiscuity all while attending church and believing it was true. Talk about guilt! While there is no way to tell how much was a consequence of the abuse its safe to say I would have had much better mental health had it never happened. My abuser brother went on a mission married in the temple and it has never been mentioned between us since it last happened. His life was seemingly perfect during the time that I was really struggling and it felt incredibly unfair. Im quite certain that he never confessed to anyone about it. Im glad you are seeing a professional therapist! I have been a social worker for children and I know that any adult that is made aware of abuse happening and particularly in a professional position or even as an unpaid clergy must report the abuse to CPS.

That is a classic piece of music by one of the most prolific composers of all of Western Music.  Every musician should perform it in their life time at least once.  Also some of the greatest music of western history is sacred music.  If you were never allowed to learn religious music in the public school system you would have to cut out so much of the repertoire and you would lose out on learning fabulous pieces of music and their composers.  It can feel weird to performhear sacred music but it is part of being a musician.  Source recently graduated music majorThere is actually a story that Handel was not religious in any sense but found that he was able to make really good money writing music for Christian families and churches. So he wrote the Messiah even though he didnt believe a single piece of it.

5985802,0,t3_3xezth,Ive experienced stress from life  a family members chronic illness it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems like you could be experiencing caregiver fatigue especially since you have no outlet. I think the idea that we always have to feel in control and alright is a holdover from our perfectionist mormon days. Even when you are feeling out of control you are the same strong you as always and the reality is life is sometimes overwhelming yet somehow we get through. I guess remembering that is what I take comfort in this too shall pass? Claim back your mental strength all those times you prayed and found some comfort or thought god wont give you too much it was really YOU that had the strength to meet the situationnothing was actually making it easier for you take back the credit.   Ive done a fair amount of therapy work especially mindfulnessmeditation but whats stuck with me the most is the idea of finding the meditation in my everyday activities. When doing the dishes being in the shower or even cooking can trigger me to be in the present do a  senses check think of something I didnt notice before that think of something I wish I could share about the moment with someone I love it works. Its hard to feel defeated when you feel ALIVE. Ive always found some temporary relief in doing new things new hikes new classes new recipes new whatever and sometimes this is what it takes to get me out of a rut but making everyday moments the richness is what Ive found to be truly sustainableregenerating. The everyday fight of life makes me feel connected to some cosmic history of all human beings doing the same. I guess for me its enough meaning.

Keep them in mind if down the line you start wishing for her back again. Dont be afraid to feel your emotions right now you should. Its healthy!Just dont spend years trying to get this relationship back together under the same circumstances. Try and start dating after you give it a few months... Once you actually go out and meet new girls youll quickly be able to find the amazing things in them and start wanting new relationships with other people.She may be amazing As is the girl I love but there are also plenty of other amazing people.Look at it this wayJust as she will never find the truth if she doesnt look past her current knowledge of it and stays with what she knows..... You will never find all those amazing young girls that are single if you continue to think shes the only amazing one for you and there is no one else.Its no different then what you want her to do. Apply it to yourself!Edit As far as being Just friends... It doesnt work for me. I have too many feelings for her. It causes me pain and everytime I talk to her I just think of how shoes ruining her life and how powerless I am to stop it. My best advice is no contact it will hurt at the start but it will get so much better at the end.I had no contact while she was on her mission and had the most free years of dating life at the end.

6006759,0,t1_cy6uybg,Right on.  I like to think of gnosticism as the belief in spiritual knowledge.  It concerns the question of whether its possible to know something spiritually or outside of the natural scientific material ways we gather knowledge.A phrase I often hear among Mormons attempting to justify their faith is that spiritual truths must be understood spiritually.  They realize that their beliefs cannot be justified through any material evidencebased criteria so they invoke a nonmaterial or spiritual way to confirm truth.  If you buy into that then youre gnostic.So the only way to be a gnostic atheist is to buy into some mechanism of spiritual knowledge confirming to you that gods are not real.  So maybe you contemplate the existence of a godless universe and that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside and you interpret that feeling as some kind of affirmation from the cosmos or something that you are right and can know that your are right then youd be a gnostic atheist.  I dont know any gnostic atheists but there are a lot of atheists who believe a lot of other weird shit not having to do with gods so I have no doubt they are out there.Most atheists are agnostic because the belief in spiritual knowledge and the belief in gods kind of go together.  Most theists are also gnostic because one of the common beliefs about gods are that they have the ability to communicate with you spiritually and grant knowledge that cant be obtained through scientific inquiry.Of course there are also people who reject the notion of spiritual knowledge but still think the existence of gods more likely than not.

However we were not to dress like this for everyday dress. This story was told to us in MIA classes many times as an example of modest dress. This is the BYU cheerleader loophole. ,exmormon,cy8vm2t,1,t5_2r0gj

One of the workmen I talked to said his company did all the carpeting for all the temples around the world this was during Hinkleys McTemple binge.

6074506,0,t3_3yqux4,Ive personally embraced science extensively since leaving. Its the only way we can objectively answer any questions about life. I used to be an agnostic atheist right after leaving but now I consider myself a gnostic atheist after everything Ive learned.As for meaning and happiness there is one thing the church occasionally taught that was very right. The joy is in the journey not the destination. Theres not some ultimate destination waiting for you and that shouldnt affect your happiness. The meaning is in the here and now in the world around you. Enjoy it for what it is  its amazing! There isnt an ultimate purpose to life and there doesnt need to be. Life just is. And thats ok! We live on through the impact we have on the world around us. We find joy in the relationships we have and the people we help. Everyone matters because the world wouldnt be the same without them.Ok I dont know if Im doing a good job at explaining any of these thoughts but thats what helps me. As Ive studied evolution and learned about how our planet and life on it really came to be it simultaneously make me feel so small but so connected to it all. I have gained so much appreciation for life and so much hope for the future of humanity. Its not predetermined and destined to end as religion would have you believe. Its up to us to make it amazing and I think that we as a species will!I accept that one day my consciousness will no longer exist and Im ok with that. It exists now so Im going to make the most of that! Live it up and enjoy life! You only have one so dont waste it being unhappy! I think it starts with some acceptance. It doesnt do any good to wish things were different than they are. Coming to terms with things can be a process but it does get better I promise! Also I highly recommend seeing a therapist.

Comstock is much more of a mix Theres a bit of Joseph Smith in him a bit of Teddy Roosevelt. I dont think there was a particular philosopher in the same way that Rand obviously was a driving force behind Andrew Ryan. For instance Roosevelt was a very progressive figure in many ways. But he was also what youd probably call a neoconservative in his view of Americas role in the world. So I have trouble comparing Comstock to him directly. Also Id have trouble just comparing Comstock to Joseph Smith or Brigham Young.

And the only way changes happen in medicine is by random doctors and nurses trying things and doing research in the field. That is where the ideas for the bigger studies start.

I am glad youre free and doing better. I was always worried if I cut anyone off Id regret it down the line but its getting easier.I moved away years ago and rarely get back to visit. Dad is still an ass similar to Trump but said something helpful and was more pleasant than usual last time I went home.Hes getting older. He probably realizes I havent just let it all go like he said I would. It was more than a moment of weakness fighting a losing battle with pedophilia. Ive read stories about people that have the urges but never harm a child. Theyre horrified by their attraction to children and inability to have relationships with adults.He groomed me for years while he was with at least my Mom. He would tell me daughters having sex with their fathers was a normal rite of passage. I wasnt taught about the Church chastity rules before it happened but I knew something wasnt right.He quite obviously enjoyed what he was doing. I lost sleep because he would get me up during the night to try to convince me to have sex with him ... or to make sure I hadnt told anyone. Sometimes I didnt sleep a wink for weeks or months ... because I feared what might happen if I wasnt awake to run or fight back.I think hes deluded himself into thinking he was a great parent and hopes Ill fully and openly acknowledge him as such before he dies. He had a few good qualities but he was otherwise horrible.I usually dont have any contact with him. Sometimes hes the one that picks up the phone during a family tragedy or he invites himself to conversations when I call someone else at the house. I try to be civil as long as hes friendly.I feel kind of sorry for him because we used to be close and I can never trust him again. Hes obviously got some type of personality disorder. There was never any true apology ... only excuses and lies.If I ever have kids I will not be able to let him near them no matter how frail he might be. It bugs me to see him interact with children even if hes not hurting them.My mother got a bad deal and wasnt confident enough to break free. Divorce especially under those circumstances would have been too embarrassing for her. I doubt Dad has believed in a long time if he ever did despite constant Church callings since his conversion. Mom is still pretty TBM. Some other difficulties came up that made it tough for her to leave him. I wish shed run off and find someone wonderful. Its her life though.

6222609,0,t3_40sbrx,I always thought that it was because the Catholic and Protestant churches allegedly have a direct line all the way back to Jesus in which the priesthood has been passed down Jesus to Peter who apparently was the first Pope and so forth. Therefore they believe their priesthood comes more or less directly from Christ. Whereas Mormons believe that at some point the priesthood stopped being past down and all that great apostasy stuff. Since only Mormons believe that Joseph received the priesthood in the forest from the angels whos names I cant recall at the moment to outsiders it would seem like they just appointed themselves with the priesthood which isnt inaccurate.

I heard about several pieces of contradictory evidence when I believed but I had faith that there had to be an explanation for it because after all the Church was True!gt Reason and evidence should be elevated but where they do not contradict faith there is no reason to reject faith as wrong.As I said above faith allowed be to continue believing because I quite literally doubted my doubts before I doubted my faith.As soon as I went from using faithwhere I started from a place of it being trueand moved from the paradigm of true until proven otherwise as you seem to be allowing for to not holding a belief untill there is sufficient evidence i.e. skepticism that is when I saw it for what it was. That is when I realized my belief simply was not justified. I agree that for most people faith is kind of what you do until you can collect evidence and that is precisely why we have approximately  different faithsdenominations of religion in the world today.Take science for example. Skepticism is where you stay until evidence can be gathered. Now imagine if science traded that space of skepticism for the space of faith you allow here. If scientists were free to hold any belief they wanted without evidence and could do so until evidence came along to prove otherwise it seems that would be to the detriment of the scientific enterprise.Do you disgagree?edit typed in my phone and it formats it wo the extra space between paragraphs.

She just gets emotional and shuts down whenever I push back hard with this or in any other way. Then she says that she feels like she is talking to an attorney and cant talk like this and that I need to back off or shell leave because if she has to choose me or choose the church shell choose the church every time. I call it the cry make veiled threats of divorce and run away strategy.I guess that counseling is the next step. Then if I want I can really play hardball like you did and see if it works.

6288060,0,t3_41q7qa,I wouldnt approach things in a conclusive way like youve decided forsure church is b.s. etc.  Id frame things as you being on a journey not sure it will lead but right now mission isnt the right direction.Also just to put this out there are you sure about what it is you want to do in terms of school and career?  I think the idea of a mission is  great a kind of out in the wild soul searching time a period spent engaged in true service.  Missionary service for the church has turned into a complete waste of time wont get an argument from me there.  But there are other opportunities for a missionlike experience that in my opinion would be valuable to you.  Peace Corps military service volunteering for any number of nonprofits that do work overseas.  An option you might also consider is coming up with something like this that replaces the mission with something else aimed at the same goals instead of abandoning it altogether.  My missionary experience was tremendously valuable for me.  I dont feel like I wasted my time.  I got lucky though and went to Japan.  If I had gone stateside I would be pissed and bitter about that wasted time. Things like this look good on your resume too.  You can get scholarships and whatnot from volunteer service like this.  Plus it can be a huge benefit to you.  Language skills for instance will be a huge benefit in just about any career.,exmormon,cz4dquj,1,t5_2r0gj

Sounded innocent enough until the interviewer asks him about it and he goes into a robotic sounding voice. He sounded off to me like he had been caught and that it was this idea that the church was so secretive. I remember attending a funeral of our former babysitter who was killed in a car accident and he came to the funeral and spoke and even then when I thought I knew the church was true I never felt the spirit from him I felt like he had rehearsed the whole talk and that he was talking down to the audience. ,exmormon,cz4h1c4,6,t5_2r0gj

Apostles barely get to stake conferences anymore but Elder Bednar made a personal visit to threaten one elder with a runofthemill faith crisis?  And he needed a Seventy on the phone to assist?

Over the last ten years or so because of the internet I would say I watch short girlongirl videos I find online by searching a very specific act and it works for me. I actually get migraines and find relief through masturbation. I also get relief from my headaches when I have an orgasm during sex. My husband knows about my fantasies and he indulges me through us talking dirty to each other and it sometimes starts with him asking me what happened in the video I found that day. My imagination is VIVID and it makes for a really good sex life. I actually get turned on when I find out hes been watching porn I dont know if thats normal. Somehow seeing him as a sexual being when Im not around or while I am not involved in the physical act of him getting off it turns me on so much. So yes I watch porn probably just as much as my husband does which is about  times per week. Were sexual people and I have really specific fantasies.

6347128,0,t3_42jebu,I will admit it felt good to find my concerns validated here on Reddit. But to be honest it often feels really lame that tscc occupies so much of my time. Life shouldnt be like this. Beliefs especially religious beliefs are nothing more than a feeling or an idea in the mind of an individual. It should be the kind of thing we only share to say I see it this way. How about you? Oh I see it a bit differently. No big deal.I have this grave worry that one day I will lay dying and will be sad that I spent read wasted so much of my time first learning LDS beliefs then teaching them then unlearning them then angry about them. So much wasted time. Even now I feel like I should simply move on with my life and never give out another thought. Who I am has NEVER changed. I am a lucky SOB born in great circumstances during the wealthiest time on earth for people like me. I should be grateful everyday and wanting to help other less fortunate than me. I should be racing ahead in life just to get a little happiness and try and help others to do the same. I should be thanking my lucky stars that I ever existed at all.Instead I am trying to unlearn stuff that should have occupied little more than a brief thought. It saddens me. Blame means little to me when I really think about it. Will proper blame get me back my wasted years? Will it make me feel better? Worrying about blame feels like being in the cave and trying to convince others to leave and pointing out how ridiculous the shadows are rather than simply being glad I can leave now.In a meta sense it feels like I should just move on.

6384320,0,t1_czfb1a3,Its a long story. Ill try to be brief but its difficult to condense.Joseph Smiths parents were extremely superstitious. Not just that but they engaged in using their superstitious powers to make money charging people to tell them where treasure was buried by the use of magic peep stones etc.... Joseph and his brother Alvin claimed great powers in magically locating treasure so they were family heroes as it were considering the family was extremely poor. Granted they never found any treasure but they definitely made money offering their services to others. When Alvin died the weight of the business fell on Joseph. Not only that but on Alvins deathbed he made Joseph promise in front of the entire family to do everything in his power to get his hands on his latest treasure speculation  a set of buried golden plates. Josephs family was big on keeping promises. If you made it you better keep it.The Smith family was also very suspicious of outsiders particularly wealthy ones. They had had several unpleasant encounters with wealthy people and saw the outside world as generally wicked evil and greedy. However within their family nobody could do any wrong. This led to a culture of lying and covering up uncomfortable events within their family.Joseph Smith was under pressure from his family to keep digging for treasure and to find the golden plates to save them from their perpetual state of poverty they were awful at managing money but he was also under pressure from outsiders to quit his fraudulent business of telling people to dig for treasure in places where it was never found the treasure kept moving he said. He was put on trial once and was made to promise never to engage in that kind of business again. His fatherinlaw made him made a similar promise.So now his honesty was at stake. How do you reconcile two opposing promises one to your family that you would find golden plates and one to your wifes family that you wouldnt look for treasure anymore? The creation of the Book of Mormon satisfied both promises and the subsequent creation of the Mormonism lifted his family out of poverty making him into the hero they had always expected him to be.,exmormon,czfbuk5,2,t5_2r0gj

Or maybe my inactive father wasnt aware that he was supposed to tell me about it before the interview or something. I would have been baptized regardless but I felt so duped sitting in this interview with an adult having no clue what he was talking about when he referred to covenants. I remember being pretty annoyed at my mom too because she came into the interview with me and had predetermined dates for us to decide on with the bishop of when certain relatives could come and when they couldnt. Like you fucking sat there and called all these people and got all prepared for this but didnt bother to tell me what the hell I was even being dragged into this interview for? I felt so stupid. I was also pretty worried about it. I remember asking my mom what the covenants were after the interview and she had no real answer. I wasnt even  and I was kind of freaking out about what I had just promised God. God was going to be so pissed if I accidentally broke a part of our agreement or decided to go back on it later. Oh man I had so many doubts. And to add to it I was very aware that my dad was addicted to gambling when he baptized me and constantly worried if I had even been legitimately baptized in Gods eyes or if God was going to punish me for letting my dad baptize me when I knew it was wrong.

Until a YW leader told me that adoption just isnt the same as having your own and being pregnant with them. It wasnt as special. And a woman in my ward had so many negative comments and lessons directed toward her for adopting an African child her husband dropped all his callings and moved their family. I heard my YW president say something along the lines of shes only adopting black children for attention.

Of course the subconscious is going to fight tooth and nail against the prospect of being ejected and shunned by the tribe. Evolution has ensured that nothing could be more natural because we a still today running on the same software we had thousands of years ago when being ejected from the tribe meant absolutely certain death and being shunned meant it was impossible to find a mate and raise a family.

Not sure I had a name or just and insult I asked again a few minutes later and was told the same thing. After having  seconds of awkward peer pressure to consider backing out of the commitments I was totally unprepared for I could only think what am I supposed to do with this name? This distracted me because they emphasized how important it was to get it right and not forget. After the clown show I timidly whispered my sacred new name into gods ear. He turned out to be some strange creepy old dude that gave a longer than comfortable hug. Thats it!? All the hype for that? There must be more. Still Not sure how this name thing works and doubting I had it right I asked a worker again and was reassured I heard correctly my new name.

Under UT law there is such thing as willful desertion for more than one year but not knowing the specifics of your case I dont know if this is what occurred between the two of you.  Likely it isnt.  Youve likely been sending her money therefore you didnt truly desert her.  Also she likely consented to your accepting a job offer in another state.  Either way it wouldnt affect child custody in any meaningful way.  Since she is and likely always has been the primary caretaker the best you can hope for in terms of custody would be every other weekend and half to maybe the whole summer plus certain holidays depending on if its an even or an odd year.  You could get more but youd have to live really close to her and your kids.  When deciding custody its all about the kids and their education.  They have to be in a situation where they attend the same school yearround.  Unless youve abused your kids andor are a drug addict and there is a documented history of such events police reports etc. there is no way she will get sole custody.

He responded what kind of doctrinal concerns?. I replied I dont believe in God anymore. He was completely floored and asked a bunch of questions trying to resolve my concerns. I informed him that discussing my concerns would not be beneficial to our future relationship. He asked if I would allow my wife and children to continue to attend church. I told him that my wife was an adult and could make her own choices. I handed him my temple recommend and that was it.,exmormon,czt24io,3,t5_2r0gj

6518472,0,t1_czppxkf,Aw screw it!  This thread is buried down deeply enough now that it wont be too huge of a risk.The storyWe once went to buy a house that had been abandoned for a year or so.  It turned out to have been owned by the son of Elder Hales who had been through a bitter divorce from his wife.  I actually met Elder and Sister Hales at the house getting it ready to be sold  cleaning  painting.  They seemed so downtoearth in that context.  We put an offer on the house and it was accepted.  Everything was rolling along well until closing day.Elder Haless son had told his ex about the sale and she had seemed ok with it.  Suddenly on closing day she just didnt show up.  She had decided to make an issue out of the house sale to disagree with it because she had not been consulted on the sale.  Our offer price was at market value and probably the best theyd get out of it.  She just wanted to be obstinate and spite her ex.Enter sister Hales unfortunately I dont remember her first name any more  eldersister were what we used then!.  She is a very sweet lady.  She heard about the exwife not showing up to sign papers and immediately called her up or even went to her in person?? I forget.  She calmed her down and convinced her that it would be best for her and everybody involved to just show up sign the papers and be done with all of it.  We went from almost losing the house due to bitterness to everything working out.I never did send that lady flowers or some other sort of thank you.,exmormon,cztk79i,1,t5_2r0gj
6518958,0,t3_44wx5h,gt...I have the social skills of a carrot...That line cracked me up. I feel you sister! I know it doesnt seem like youll ever get out of high school or your parents house but you will. I promise you will! And life after high school is SO much better. You can go to a college far away from your hometown. Cost be damned! Take out student loans if you have to. Get the fuck away from there. Go to a nice liberal town. Youll meet a beautiful lady and have a nice relationship. Then youll meet some more ladies. Youll make lots of friends who accept you for who you are not despite who you are. Youll study things you really like youll work a fun but crappy job. Youll graduate and feel bad ass about it. Youll get a job working in some awesome city and youll start saving money to go somewhere youve always wanted. Youll settle down into a relationship with a lovely lady and you can start a family. And the best goddamn thing about that is that you will be happy because you will be living your authentic life. High school is a few short years of your life. It sucks now. I know. I hated high school. Find things that you love that can be an escape for you books art blogging hobbies etc. etc and keep yourself busy. Time will go by faster and you can develop some skills. As far as going back to church it might be the best thing for you it might not. I had to fake my way through church while in high school or my home life was going to be hell. I wouldnt have been able to leave my house outside of seminary work and school if I didnt pretend to be on board. But youll have to gauge the situation and decide if its necessary for your high school survival. High school is the prologue. Prologues are always shit. ,exmormon,cztm0ji,9,t5_2r0gj

It just shows that those scholars recognized it was an indefensible position.

6600248,0,t3_461det,Short answer  its worth holding on as long as you have mutual goals for the marriage.  So your first step should be to talk about what the marriage means for both of you.What does the marriage mean to you?  What does your family mean to you?  What does a happy family feel like?  It might be helpful if the next big thing that you try to explain to your wife is not anything about the church but is entirely about your family.  My guess is something like My hope for our family is that its one of love.  That you and I take care of each other and love each other and have fun together and work through hard times together and have joy.  My hope for our children is that we show them love between us and shower them with love and teach them to be good kind honest people.I dont know how that conversation goes but I think that she doesnt understand that people can be good people without being Mormon.  There are plenty of people who grow up in the church with FHE every Monday that arent good people and there are plenty of people outside of the church who are wonderful people.  You want your kids and your family to be loving and happy and that can happen without the church.Get her to explain what she wants for your family and encourage her to explain it outside of the confines of mormonism.  If she says I want an eternal family say Yes but what kind?  What does that mean?  How do you want us to treat each other in the eternities?  What are the values of our family?  TSCC doesnt have a lock on kindness or humor or perseverance or silliness.  There are Mormon families that are superstrict some that are laissez faire.  Theres no one kind of eternal family so what kind of family do you want?  Not defined by how they spend their time but by how they treat each other.Hopefully theres some mutual ground.  I think that that conversation will tell you a lot.  I for one am supercurious as to what you and your wifes answers are.gt She claims that she will go through some things with me gospel topic essays mormon stories podcast but I dont know if holding on to the hope that she will one day either see the light or just simply understand me is realistic.Id shoot for simply understand me.And that means maybe extending an olive branch or seventy times seven olive branches in her direction first.  Its hard because youre both in a lot of pain and youre both afraid.On your wifes behalf I think it worth remembering that the only narrative she has for understanding whats happening is a nightmarish lie.  She has been taught all her life that what youre going through is evil  that leaving only happens when someone succumbs to the devil.  Shes got a mental boogieman imprinted in her head through brainwashing.  You remember what its like to deprogram so some slackcutting is in order.So validate that fear  tell her I understand that youve been told that any time someone disbelieves its for bad reasons.  I understand that youre afraid that because I dont believe Im not a good person that Ill wreck everything that youve been working toward in your life.  I get why youre scared.And Im scared.  Im scared that you dont actually love me.  That you only love what I could do for you.  Im scared that Im not uburner The man that I chose for my partner because I love him and cherish him. Im scared that Im uburner the meal ticket.  Do you understand that?  How awful that is for me?  Im scared that you dont actually care about me that the love that you have for me is strictly conditional.  That all I am to you is a checkbox on the way to something more.I promise that Im still a good person and Ill prove that  I still believe in honesty in integrity in kindness in love and in our marriage.  I still love you for who you are not where you do or dont go to church.  I need you to tell me if you love me for me or only for my temple recommend.,exmormon,d020ptc,3,t5_2r0gj

Remember that LDS clerks are just as professional at their job as any other random idiot in the ward is They have poor training Long hours and little motivation.Now Moving past general incompetence and laziness We have three additional factors for bad numbers. Local wards get budget money based on how many people attend sacrament meeting members or not. So the obvious motivation of reporting higher numbers to get more money is a real thing Even if its small scale. Mormon Bishops and Stake Presidents get promoted based on their performance Their ability to lie be a good ol boy and their charisma. So its another obvious motivation to lie about the numbers or at the very least to misrepresent them somehow pregnant people count for !. There is no motivation to have accurate low numbers Everyone benefits from higher numbers Money for activitys Praise Promotions Laziness  Since there are absolutely no drawbacks for having errors and there is very little oversight The system is naturally corrupt Its pretty much designed to be.,exmormon,d08w8uc,30,t5_2r0gj

Therefore you are willing to agree with her on that approach. In order to make any spending decisions both parties in the marriage have to agree to it. You each have equal veto power. Like I said she has already indicated that this is the kind of approach that she wants.So pursuant to the agreement you will stop eating out and she will stop paying tithing. Thats it.

6713782,0,t1_d0dqoby,gtMy point is are we really any different from the group we once left or have we just changed the sources that we are allowing to exploit our weaknesses control our thoughts and cause us to cease to question and reconsider?That doesnt really make sense. It assumes that our current sources are just as false as a TBMs source. The difference between our sources is that each one of us can individually fact check and find out what is true and what is not or at least get as close as we can. TBMs are unable to even start this process except for those who end up exmo. Whats the difference between two people both growing up in the church and being taught the same things and one remains a believer and the other falls away? The thought process is demonstrably different. TBMs believe because they believe. Exmos dont believe because something about them whether they were more curious more rational more bold or even more devout they sought answers. TBMs dont seek answers. We know this based on church culture weve all experienced that they are actively discouraged from seeking answers.I understand it can feel shitty to know that people are thinking that you or the group you used to belong to is shitty and stupid. Criticism is hard to take. Sometimes youre right and people get angry and arent really criticizing anything and are just hurling insults. But that post that fired you off had a critical point of view not merely haha theyre as stupid as kids.

You can consciously feel nothing but compassion and acceptance for LGBTQ individuals and still espouse homophobic assumptions in much the same way that the sweet little old lady I overheard talking to her daughter genuinely intended it as a compliment when she said that Politician was such an eloquent speaker especially for a black man! When you assert that all or most gay men are effeminate your unspoken assumption is that homosexual men lack the capacity for masculinity in some way. ,exmormon,d0eod5a,3,t5_2r0gj

In that case the kleptomania is no longer harmful.Is child molestation harmful? Yes because it can cause physical and psychological harm to children. But not all pedophiles act on their urges. If so they are no longer harmful.Is homosexuality harmful? Nope. So ummm...yes we should accept the gayz.,exmormon,d0f6tio,1,t5_2r0gj

As mentioned in an earlier comment I used to run site search for a major travel brand. We used to promote and suppress results all the time. Think of it like a mini Google inside the website but the admin has Google God mode so that certain things show up higher or lower depending on a multiplier positive or negative.Its obvious theyve done this to the essays which leads me to believe that one of the only reasons they ever posted the essays was for external search search optimization so LDS.org would at least show up for people who were looking on GoogleYahooBing. But the fact that they arent available through site search tells me they never meant for the content to be accidentally discovered by the chapel Mormons.,exmormon,d0f94sf,4,t5_2r0gj

But you might want to let her control the message to whoever she is most sensitive about.  And if you can tell her this is your cautious way of moving ahead with plans to marry she may be able to spin that.

But that just makes him dig in his heels even more. I dont think its a stretch to think that Joseph was emboldened by criticisms against him. As for the family theres some interesting research that suggests children are better off being raised nonreligious. But even more than that I think this is a perception issue.

To whom it may concern    I am the lesbian daughter of Kathryn Skaggs the author of the recent blog post condemning the Disney movie Frozen for having a liberal gay agenda. I am also an active believing member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints as well as a mental health professional. After much personal debate and inner turmoil I feel it is important to state publicly just as I have many many times privately that I do not support the vilifying of the gay community that occurs through much of this blog post and has also been a part of other posts made by my mother in the past. Perpetually stigmatizing and demonizing the LGBT community has been shown to contribute to serious mental health problems within this population such as depression anxiety and suicide ideation that tragically at times has ended in death. Such attitudes and language also continues to foster isolation and unnecessary wedges between LGBT people and their families and within communities and I can no longer sit silent as I am fully aware that these things continue to be experienced as harmful not only to myself but to some of the most vulnerable within the Mormon population and in society. I pray my fellow members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints will collectively continue to move forward in following the teachings our church leaders on this matter as they advocated on mormonsandgays.org which specifically calls for sensitivity thoughtfulness compassion love and being at the forefront of outreach to lesbians and gays.  As a church no one should be more loving and compassionate.  Elder Quentin L. Cook  I hope and pray that might truly be so.

Judges frequently overrule throw out or dismiss objections and evidence if they werent submitted timely or dont follow the rules of civil procedure never mind that you may have a strong case on the merits.

6851016,0,t3_49ltrd,This is not an exact transcription but a good representation of what was said. This is for the last  questions asked I only tuned in at the end.Question to Sis. Stevens How can we decide the difference between our own thoughts and the promptings or voice of the holy ghost?Answer Anything thats good comes from the spirit Elder Holland agrees. When youre struggling with something youll have all kinds of little thoughts. Whenever i have a little thought I always say thank you thank you bc Im just going to give credit to the Spirit for that I wont take credit for that. If its a native thought  if youre unsettled or you dont have peace about it then you would know its not from the Spirit.Elder Holland Dont let that question immobilize you. Its almost a nonissue. God can speak to your mind heart intelligence. There are different ways god can communicate and i think its counterproductive to worry about where thats coming from. Measure it against the standards of the scriptures words of brethren and see if those thoughts line up. If youre having a good thought good things come from god and evil and inappropriate things come from God. Dont want to be simplistic sometimes decisions are more complex than good v. evil. But overall relax and follow after good things.Sis. Stevens understand and discover how the Spirit speaks to you.Question Those who have SGA struggle. What would you say to them?Holland This is a current sensitive topic for the Church. but let me say this to begin we have talked altogether too much about gender and too little about chastity. The issue is chastity not gender. There is plenty of information about there about attraction and we dont make judgments about attractions. We dont know why that happened or how its an individual struggle or circumstance. But we say we teach chastity for heterosexuals for those with homosexual tendencies whatever  we go with what God has taught about chastity and the proper use of the body ltcut out for a few secondsgt. It helps if we shift to chastity about which the Lord has been very clear and will continue to be clear for all his children.Now what we ask of those with SGA is the same as those with heterosexual feelings be faithful be clean and be chaste. For you then every blessing of the Church is available including all the covenants and ordinances. Every hope can be obtained if you are faithful. If some members fall short on that shame on them and if i havent taught it well enough shame on me. we are not condemning those that have the inclination nor are we making them secondclass citizens anymore than sisters who choose not to go on missions. We are simply setting a standard to keep commandments... and there are commandments not a few. But the leaders would be on the front line to say that every person is welcome at church in our circles of friendship on the basis of everyone trying to keep the commandments be chaste names a few other commandments.I hope some of the pain can come out of the conversation as we talk more fundamentally about the standards of chastity and less about whether thats a heterosexual or homosexual application of that law.Followup question Whatever people struggle with a lot of people fear that happiness is not available to them. What words of hope would you have for them to find happiness?Holland We try not to make arbitrary distinctions. In my professional life ive only had  married secretaries and all others were single. And those single women can just as justifiably ask those questions as a person with SGA of what hope is there for me when will I have these blessings? But they have the same assurety to have all blessings that the lord has to offer names blessings like temple ordinances having children blessing children etc.. So back to the core lessons faith hope charity .... We all ask questions of where is hope for me where is happiness. We will all have occasion to wonder that and the answer is those promises will be fulfilled.,exmormon,d0svcfh,9,t5_2r0gj

I can say that almost clinically everything youve listed in your post sounds like normal depression... not wanting to go anywhere or do anything no ambitions or desires no will to liveyou are most definitely depressed. And right now your birth family is your world. But please believe me when I say that you havent even stepped out into the actual world yet. There are SO MANY people with varying ideas interests likes dislikes and such! It is not inevitable that your life must end. If your current life is not happy then go and find a new one that is. Do not resign yourself to despair. When youre depressed its hard to feel like you could ever deserve to be happy. But happiness isnt something earned OP its something we wish and hope for others. And I wish happiness for youthat you can pull yourself out of this black hole and heal from the wounds.Last note my husband was depressed for  years after leaving the church and it was the same hole you are in right now.

Just because the state law was  years old doesnt mean it was constitutional.  Just because the state of Utah had a constitutional amendment does not mean it supercedes the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution which as we all know was ultimately affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

This pointless since you dont even bother to read my replies and see that I am an atheist since age  who just tries to explain to you the theological difference in the concept of Jesus in Christianity on one hand There is only one god and he has three parts but they are all only  person and Mormonism on the other There are multiple Gods and the heavenly father is one of them Jesus another and they are seperate persons and not one. Maybe you are the one that should ask Do you have some kind insecurity that makes you wanna feel that you used to be a weird christian and not a weird other? ,exmormon,d15utfg,1,t5_2r0gj
6966748,0,t1_d15r7h9,Great question. The modern LDS HQ has built their entire raison dtre on their Exclusive Divine Mandate garnered thru Joseph Smiths prophetic calling earned by Joseph in three ways The First Vision. Which apparently nobody knew about until long after the  establishment of the Church. And which came in so many different versions from Joseph as to discredit that it even happened. HQ now explains away both the delay and the divergent versions with the slippery apologetics we all know.  The PeterJamesJohn ordination.  Which also nobody knew about until there was an authority crisis.  And which seems too much of a convenience and when combined with the entire spiritual eyes phenomenon seems less than credible. HQ now relies on Josephs honesty and Olivers complicity to hold up this event as foundational.  The Divinity and Historicity of the BOM. Which shows almost  conclusively to have been crafted from contemporary sources the Bible and Josephs and others creativity. HQ now sticks with the story that the BOM came from Joseph and no one else and that its historical veracity thus corroborates Josephs calling. It is Josephs specific prophetic calling and priesthood that gives the LDS its Exclusive Divine Mandate. And it is this Mandate that empowers LDS HQ and Members to produce good LDS Fruits in the name of their role as One above Many. It is their unique calling as they see it. All other Churches are an abomination right?When this Exclusive Divine Mandate falls away in light of the historical record Occams Razor overwhelming circumstantial evidence an innate moral compass and so forth the LDS Member is left without their raison dtre unless they are successful at cog dis or lying as you put it. Without the Exclusive Divine Mandate the Truth Claim the Member either a knows it is not True and discounts the need for the Mandate and Truth Claim and focuses on bearing good LDS Fruit b ignores all the FactsTruth and shelves the entire Truth Claim matter in the name of we dont really know or God ways are mysterious and focuses on bearing good LDS Fruit c associates spiritual experiences as a trump to the FactsTruth and focuses on bearing good LDS Fruit or d leaves the Church to find other ways to bear good Fruit elsewhere hopefully.Thus unlike other Churches the LDS is not content to claim its Mandate from the Bible or the witness of Jesus or the good Fruit in and of itself. There are many Churches sects movements that bear good Fruit for reasons other than an Exclusive Divine Mandate. These organizations vary in their missions and dedication to proselytism but seem much more comfortable being One among Many than HQ can even begin to contemplate. Pope Francis is a good example of a Church leader who is expanding their tent and even openly acknowledging that many roads lead to God and that we should all be focusing on bearing good Fruit regardless of the Brand. I am asking HQ to release its Members of the Exclusive Divine Mandate and the Truth Claim which is in fact untrue so the focus can be on bearing good Fruit period without all the cog dis and lying. Interestingly many active LDS Members in a private moment will discount many of the Official HQ LDS teachingsdoctrines with regard to LDS Exclusivity both in terms of Mandate and the Afterlife. For this reason and others the Truth Claim is dissipating both outside the Church and inside the Church. I say that Fruits are HQs only winning hand because I conjecture that the Truth Claim is going to dissipate under the weight of evidence and attrition. They will only be left with Fruits and they should find another way to motivate and justify LDS Fruits above other Fruits. This is why I am recommending that HQ back away from the Truth Claim and find some apologetic way to secure a Mandate for bearing good LDS Fruits which really should be the sake of the good Fruits. If anyone is experienced in apologetics it is LDS HQ. By the way I believe that all good Fruit is good regardless of Brand. In my life I no longer bear good LDS Fruit just good Fruit. I hope Ive been able to express in writing my views in a coherent and logical way.NeoGalileo,exmormon,d160m0p,1,t5_2r0gj

Its not up to you to decide what is right or wrong if you are living with your mom. You come off as really ungrateful  sounds like your mom is allowing you to get back on your feet you didnt say she forces you to read the scriptures or go to church but requesting that you dress reasonably modestly in front of her other family members seems like a reasonable ask.

7083551,0,t1_d1j0ixl,Thanks for the question it has caused me to reflect. First let me say I was projecting my experience on others including TBMs which is unfair. Im certain there are plenty of TBMs who are blissfully happy with each other.I suppose there were a few things for us. Of course we had some great times before but for a while there when I was losing my faith and she was not our relationship just started getting more shallow. We couldnt connect the same way. I couldnt share what I really thought or be my authentic self a lot of times. That certainly hurts intimacy.Also regrettably being raised in a religion which was fertilized by the doctrine of polygamy and penishood I didnt have the view of women that I should have had. Not that I was a misogynist but I just lacked the empathy and understanding that I should have had for her and women in general. Once I shed those priesthood views I could truly value her for who she is and treat her as a true equal.Lastly like I said in another post I think the guilt and shame associated with sex and LDS culture played a big part. Once we were both able to shed that baggage we became truly happy and that manifests itself naturally in the love life.The porn part was more or less a joke just lamenting the idea that I never wouldve imagined being in this situation even a year ago. Not that watching it as a couple is some achievement or mark of success. And yet here we are having guilt free sex incorporating extra stimulus as we see fit and being guiltshame free about it.Its really the first time in our marriage that I feel  satisfied and happy with life and she feels the same we discuss this concept frequently. So much the opposite of what we were taught growing up lds. Getting here was not easy though.Anyway hope that answers it. Thanks again for helping me reflect.,exmormon,d1jabpw,5,t5_2r0gj
7085547,0,t3_4cmewu,A lot of records are available to the public though some have traditionally been hard to find. Youd have to find out which records archive houses the microfilm youre interested in then go search through microfilm until you find the right records.The LDS church is one of the biggest organizations pushing genealogical research. They have people put records online or index the records to make the offline records searchable and locatable. Basically they want to make it as easy as possible for a person to trace their ancestry.One reason why immigration records are really important for that is that they are main and often only way to tie a person to their family tree in their country of origin.The primary purpose of the genealogical research is to make it so that members of the church can trace their ancestry and then take the names of their ancestors to an LDS temple and perform vicarious ordinances for them baptism marriage and other LDSspecific ordinances. It is believed that these ordinances are only valid if they are accepted by the deceased on the other side.gt What can I do about this?There is probably not much you can do. The records are probably public records and the LDS church has probably made agreements with the Brazilian government. They have likely agreed to perform the service of digitizing the records in exchange for the ability to host or access the records.,exmormon,d1jii2t,1,t5_2r0gj

7097721,0,t3_4cp6wr,This hits home for me. Im very angry over my loss of identity and life purpose. I married and had kids far too early for my personality. Not that I didnt want kids it was just that being raised that my whole righteousness and purpose for eternity was linked to family and marriage. If you cant succeed there youre pretty much a failure. Trying to get over that idea has been difficult. Finding out your actually allowed to do more is terrifying. TSCC life style has created a situation that now in my s I feel like a teenager starting all over again but with an adult situation. Its hard. One thing Ive learned with my chaotic relationships is that a relationship is based off of not what the other is doing for me but what I can do for them. Im big. I can and should be responsible enough with enough confidence to handle myself. This can be so difficult when you feel there is nothing left inside of yourself. Thats when stepping back and taking care of yourself is so important. Ive watched the depression so rampant in women at TSCC. Each time I may go to visit its God is trying me or God is blessing me. WTF! Take some credit for your accomplishments and when things are difficult stop and take a look at what youre contributing to the situation. Im a strong believer in the making of your own reality and that people only treat you the way youve taught them to treat you. It was freeing and terrifying when I came to that realization. The idea that all the good AND all the bad were solely an idea of what I thought of myself. But being able to take the reins fully in my life was the best thing that came out me leaving. And each day it gets better. Even with a Bishop Father who has it in his head that I cant succeed without the support and help of a man. I totally jumped into my second marriage due this push. It put a lot of hardship on my current relationship. All the best to you and your relationship! ,exmormon,d1kwb55,2,t5_2r0gj

7113076,0,t3_4cwvhx,So towards the end of my mission I was having a sort of crisis of faith. I spent hours a day studying praying and fasting to try and find out the truth. But the more I did those things that I was supposed to do the less things made sense. I talked to many leaders and missionaries and after getting one too many iterations of You just need more faith or Well God will just answer in his own time I decided that I should just talk to my mission president about it. I knew that my mission president was a little strange he did and said some really really weird things but I was holding out hope that maybe this man could help me find the truth. I wanted the church to be true it just didnt seem like it could be to me. I was hoping that he could fix that. So I texted him and asked if I could meet with him because I thought that I wanted to go home. I didnt get a response from him but about three hours later I lived about that far from the mission home he pulled up to our house and knocked on the door. That was pretty weird itself but whatever. Anyway so he wants to meet with my companion first. They go into a room and talk for a while and then my turn comes. The first thing that he says to me is how my companion was upset with me and how he said that I was ruining his mission. This was really weird to me since my companion and I were pretty much in the same boat as far as our beliefs and doubts went and talking to him later it turned out that this was a straight up lie my mission president said to me to make me feel guilty. After that I brought up some of my concerns with the church and the doctrine and he gave me the whole Pray and study and fast thing. So I tell him that I have been doing that and that it hasnt been helping. I told him the more I prayed and studies the more I felt that nothing was true. Not one to hold back any punches he got straight to the point my problem was that I had been praying to Satan fun side note I mentioned that he said this to his wife and got a call back from him the next day saying that I had misheard him and that he would never say that. So that was weird. I wasnt offended so much as confused. After arguing that I had indeed been praying to the same entity that I had been my entire life I told him that if I was getting any answers from prayers they were ones telling me to go home. He then told me that I was wrong and that he was the only one who could receive revelation for me and that I wasnt entitled to receive personal revelation because my choice would affect others. Never mind that contradicting the core of mormonism apparently thats how things worked.Anyway I wasnt offended by any of that so much as I was confused. He was a very strange man who said very strange things.,exmormon,d1mnsrb,3,t5_2r0gj

7150328,0,t3_4dfdt1,For me it was a bit of both.Having depression hit me during a rough time in my life initially unrelated to church made it really difficult to feel the Spirit. Asshole YSA bishop made attending socially uncomfortable. Then I start looking into uncorrelated materials initially rationalfaiths.com and Mormon Matters Podcast.Both of these sources attempt to address issues with the church from a spiritualityfriendly perspective. Among other things they exposed me to interesting historical issues. Eventually came across Mormon Stories and respected John Dehlin for openly and honestly addressing issues. These are good     And      Eventually came across information relating to the Priesthood ban indicating that it was taught as doctrine. The Lowry Nelson letters were very eyeopening I eventually realized that the Mormon concept of revelation is entirely unreliable as a means of gaining information or making a decision. It either indistinguishable from or nothing but emotional conditioning and cognitive biases.In my experience the CES Letter is a great summary of many of the historical and intellectual issues but I only came across it pretty much after my shelf had collapsed.The November policy removed any doubt I had on my new position on revelation.As for telling your parents I dont have any idea of your specific relationship with them. My general advice is to not rock the boat while you are living with them. Telling them will always be tricky so when you do stress that your feelings for them havent changed at all. Also present your views as calmly as possible while avoiding any hint of the COLDS is a demonstrable fraud tone.,exmormon,d1qx4sd,3,t5_2r0gj
7151061,0,t1_d1qund2,I agree. I think its possible theres some twisted reason why they are not calling any minorities into the highest positions in the church.

Some of them might really actually think that white and delightsome was only changed to appeal to the World but that it still is true.And also perhaps because some of their predecessors might have done some foul shit that nonwhites may struggle with.Edit after seeing some of the things the men at the top have done Monson and Nelson in East Germany Kimball down in Chile Prop  and if you look at some of the stuff they did in central America and Mexico with respect to native leadership I dont put it beyond them.

I barely made it through my rd year hike. I knew of the trail they were going on its brutal with is steep steep incline. While carrying gear? My  year old brain did not want to suffer that embarrassment. There were some mean girls in my stake. Some nice ones some not so nice. Oh but you have to go! Everyone is going and you need to to get this yeas thingamabob! Nope dont have to. The section the hike was in was in a do two of the three section and I did another thing. Idk first aid or something.So about a week before I told the leaders I wasnt going. All of the YW councilors tried to talk me into going the bishop tried some girls camp leader tried. No I dont want to Ill go the next day with the other girls.So I went the next morning and hung out with the inactive girls whos parents were using girls camp as a summer activity for their kids. Noone questioned why they didnt go on the overnight hike but every single mother I interacted with that morning asked why I didnt go. I didnt want toI had never really heard about the overnight hike before but suddenly that year every testimony mentioned it. The bishop said something to our ward about how spiritual it was to see all of the girls holding onto the chain so that they didnt fall off the cliff.But who brought all the stuff no one else had because they couldnt pack it?

SCOTUS only determined that it is unconstitutional for states to allow one man and one woman to marry while not offering marriage rights to two persons... regardless of gender.The question was never if three four or five people should be allowed to marry.

Oh wait... eternal... partner... Never mind... youre good  preordained maybe!  In the st century do Mormons marry people they dont know? What a stupid thing for god to say to you Youll probably marry someone that you know so make sure you have good i.e. white and delightsome friends. This shows us that of course English is gods second or th language  does he not know that you dont use that in reference to a person and that its not customary to end with a preposition? In the end a good copy editor would have left you with something like Choose good friends because your husband will be one of them.  vs.  words But hell why choose few words when many will do? God is certainly not economical in his wording  nor straightforward. My PB has that same swirling prose that all blessings seem to have. I threw it away a while ago but it has something like You shall be among the honest and faithful that god ordained to be among the people of the earth who are honestly seeking the righteousness and truth of this mortal existence and shall seek out the righteous among those who are not seeking out righteousness through their decisions to make unrighteous choices and thus will be sealed up for the judgements of god to be brought down upon their heads upon this earth in their day and in their time and in their manner according to the lords will.Edit forgot to pluralize a word.,exmormon,d299xf6,1,t5_2r0gj

These feelings are totally irrational but very real and they were programmed into you by nefarious officials at the highest levels of the Lds church on purpose and with the full knowledge of the total falsehood of Lds history and doctrine.  As you distance yourself from the church and learn more about its history and bad deeds it will become easier for you to comprehend why you feel this way and why you have no need to feel like this.

The same will apply when presenting new ideas to religious conservatives.  gtHow can we be sure now that the ban on gay marriage isnt wrong now?  Rather sow dissonancedoubt than challenge the ingroup directly   Was it the duty of members to receive their own confirmation by the spirit that this doctrine was from God?   Do you think God might have told anyone during that time that He was not the source of the policy denying the ordinances required for exaltation to any people of colour?   Considering how even Governor George Romney was chastised by a member of the  for supporting Civil Rights alongside Martin Luther King contrary to the direction presented in what the church now considers a doctrine of men should the common member expect discipline if they express their conviction that a policy is contrary to the principles of the Gospel of Christ?   If members feel this way is it better to simply not actively support it or is it their duty to oppose it just as early church members opposed the Prophet Joseph Smith when he wished to change the policy of church leaders being paid and asked to be given a salary alongside Sidney Rigdon? Or do we have to support the prophet regardless of the promptings of the spirit? reference to the salary eventgtThe abovenamed committee reported to the high council at a subsequent meeting but the sum agreed upon is left blank in the history as printed. The amount they asked for was ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS each per annum.gtThe question was warmly discussed by the members of the council until near sundown. George M. Hinkle bitterly opposed it as the Church had always been opposed to a salaried ministry.  A majority of the council however favored the measure so that when the vote was called eleven voted for it and one against it.  But when it was noised abroad that the council had taken such a step the members of the Church almost to a man lifted their voices against it. The expression of disapprobation was so strong and emphatic that at the next meeting of the high council the resolution voting them a salary was rescinded.gtWe were present and acted as clerk of the council at both meetings therefore know whereof we affirm.,exmormon,d2geoia,3,t5_2r0gj

7450448,0,t1_d2orbp5,Thanks for sharing that. There must be a pretty broad spectrum for the types of experiences each individual has serving their mission. The loneliness and depression I can definitely relate too. I also felt very inadequate when it came to things like street contacting because I am somewhat introverted myself. Most days I did everything I could to avoid having to talk to people on the bus or on the street. I knew I was supposed to and when I didnt I would feel an excessive amount of guilt. I definitely dealt with depression the second half of my mission probably due to the extreme amount of guilt for not being perfect. But what I really enjoyed about the mission was how difficult it was. And as I pushed through and was able to finish the two years I felt an enormous sense of accomplishment. At the same time I really felt the mission was not how I expected it. Way too much emphasis on numbers as well as strict adherence to the hours and schedule.In the end it was just an awesome growing experience for me. One I feel like I want my kids to experience without perpetuating the fraud of the LDS church.Anyway thanks for sharing. Its good to hear your experience.

7457831,0,t3_4hg4cn,My wife and I went and saw a powerful play written by TBM playwright Melissa Lelani Larson who also wrote the screenplay for the TBM movie Freetown and staged by Plan B Theater Company called Pilot Program.  It was basically a thought exercise showing what could happen if the LDS church decided to reinstate the practice of polygamy.  It was devastating and haunting to say the least.  Afterward my wife admitted that if the church reinstated polygamy that she would probably have to leave.  I honestly have no idea how she could stay after that but somehow she still makes it work.No doubt polygamy has a huge human toll especially for the women involved.  The thing that blows my mind is that Ive known several TBM women who would welcome it and these arent firebreathing fundie wannabes.

Originally it was NOT about theology at all but merely a ploy to legitimize Smith as a treasure digger and then later the manuscript was for sale!  It was only when the market started running dry for fraudulent treasure diggers that the idea of starting a religion began.  But it is also well to note that the BofM was not a key feature at all in Smiths new protestant group and was not used in legitimizing theology.  Only later when polygamy and other problems threatened the disintegration of the group then Smith and others started relying on more and more miraculous shit such as the Peter James and John fantasy.

Its like If someone held a gun to your head and commanded you to deny Jesus... First of all no. That isnt going to happen. Second of course it would be better to give the maniac what he wants and be on your wayit does not reflect on your faith it reflects on his lunacy. And third those very dramatic scenarios paint a blackandwhite picture of faith and of tests of faith. Some better questions would be So you believe in Jesus Christwould you move in next door to someone who doesnt? What have you done to reach out to those in need? If God appeared to you and asked you to give most of your fortune to help eradicate world hunger or to promote gay marriage! would you do it? Kind of ridiculous examples but my point is that in the Bible Jesus was much more interested in how people treated others than in whether they toed lines and he certainly didnt approve of the ones who condemned people for their choices.

Freedom is on the other side of hell. Suicide doesnt end the chances of life getting worse but it eliminates that chances of it ever getting better. I would give nearly anything to get my friend back. To be able to talk to her. To see her. If you dont want to be a burden to your friend then dont kill yourself.

7583700,0,t3_4j6dcs,gt  in transferring records he contacts the Bishop of the new ward to give him the skinny on this troubled hardtoworkwith member.I was a ward clerk. Let me provide some additional insight on how this works.Membership records can be transferred by pushing them or pulling them so to speak. Pushing. If the previous ward clerk knows a members new address the previous ward clerk can enter the new address and the ward clerk is given a list of wards applicable to that address e.g. singles ward family ward Spanish speaking ward etc.. The ward clerk selects the ward and transfers the record. When a ward clerk pushes a membership record to a new ward he can select a contact previous bishop option before transferring them. When the new ward receives the transferred record there is a note if the previous ward clerk selected the option to contact the previous bishop in the report that is generated every time a new record arrives. Even without this note the new bishop may choose to call the previous bishop on his own.Pulling. The ward clerk of the new ward clerk and request a membership record with the members birthdate and full name or with a membership record number. When this happens the previous ward will still get a report indicating that another ward has transferred the membership record which will give the prior bishop an opportunity to call the new bishop and give him a report which can be positive or negative.,exmormon,d348a3e,2,t5_2r0gj

7633455,0,t3_4js79f,I spent most of my life as a Mormon with a more deist philosophy. The concept of a true church didnt really make sense to me and I was willing to stay in the church because I figured it was probably as good as the next one. Upon leaving I didnt really see the need for another church to fill the void. I think looking at Mormon history where the blemishes are so well recorded due to the recency can easily make you wonder what blemishes in other faiths have been erased with the passage of time. I was just reading John yesterday and noticed that just before Judas left to betray Jesus to the Pharisees he was angered by the episode where Mary poured an expensive ointment on Jesus. Judas asked why they didnt sell it and use the money for charity and Jesus defended her actions. Is this a hint at Jesus preaching selflessness and giving to others but being willing to live more luxuriously himself? Was Judas disaffected by a hypocrisy that we now have little evidence of? Was he an ancient William Law? Give the church a thousand years to shape the narrative with contrary sources covered up or lost to the ravages of time and wed probably have an unambiguously Judaslike history for William Law as well. I think the experience of leaving Mormonism at least due to church history concerns provides a master class in how to become an atheist. For my wife she made the step to atheism later than the step of leaving the church so she ended up attending the local UU congregation to fill the void and still participates there for the social connection. ,exmormon,d39vro5,2,t5_2r0gj

7644433,0,t1_d3b3tpc,gtSo let me be clear that drive took forever only makes sense if it isnt taken literally.And thats precisely what Im saying about moral statements.  You need not take them literally.  Well I have to be careful here because I dont want to make it sound like Im endorsing noncognitivism.  In a context where youre debating someone who shares your basic goals and desires a statement like eating meat is wrong could be literally true if we make a small addendum to the end like ...for us given our shared goals and desires although even then we must be very careful given the debate over realism vs. eliminativism of mental states like desires.  I ultimately think that almost nothing of what we say is literally true.gtits difficult to understand what could be implied here that would make sense.I gave an easier case above about a context where its established that we can have a rational debate over reasons.  In a case where its clear that Im not expecting anyone to be responsive to my reasons like if a sociopath kills someone and I exclaim thats wrong! my statement has implications such as I dont like that I wish people wouldnt do that someone should stop him etc.  Again let me make it clear that Im not a noncognitivist I think my statement thats wrong! in this case is both truthapt and false.  Its just that I think the story as to why I and others are inclined to make such statements is similar to the one that the noncognitivists give.gtI however cant see how they would be able to give themselves any good reasons to care about their first order beliefsCertain firstorder beliefs and desires might be beneficial to even more bedrock desires and these bedrock desires might even be quite altruistic such as I want to maximize utility.  But you are correct when you hit a certain level there is no mindindependent reason to care about your particular set of desires over any other set.gtI dont understand what you mean by this.Sorry utility would have been a better word.  People say things because it makes good things happen.  Whether a statement is true or not is often irrelevant to the effects it causes.  Although I do think that social force is a good phrase particularly to describe the use of moral statements because I do think that morals in some cases are used as tools of social control.gtWell no sorry....any better?,exmormon,d3b4pxx,1,t5_2r0gj

He cant really build a romantic relationship with you while on his mission without breaking rules. But if he feels an attraction Im betting he will find a very subtle way to let you know.The hard thing is that missionaries are told to jump straight from that nodating mission lifestyle into marriage. Its very common for them to be engaged within  months of going home from their mission and married in  with a baby a year later. And they are told that the most important qualification to look for in a partner is to choose a templeworthy member. Some people luck into great relationships even moving so fast other marriages struggle. From an outside perspective its crazy but if two people are both devout and share the same valueslifestyle it helps. So with that warning .... Are you ready to be a married Mormon in a year? To move to the US? What would he do if he stayed there for a career?Being from different countries makes life interesting but can cause some huge challenges  I wouldnt do it without knowing each other for a long time. Theres a chance he isnt like that but theres a lot of pressure for that. I was raised LDS and married someone from a different country and religion  but I would never have served a mission because I dont like telling people what to think. As you think about this Id like to invite you to read these essays on the official LDS website. They address some of the more troubling aspects of Mormonism in a way that aims to resolve any doubts these issues create. They are in many languages including Portugese. I think that they contain some lies and misdirection but are a way for you and even your missionary to find out what some of the problems are. They are a little hard to find on LDS.org but you can find easy links to them on www.mormonessays.com. I suspect your missionary may not know this stuff. I didnt. There is some good analysis of these essays at www.mormonthink.com if you are interested in the critical perspective on the Mormon church. I would recommend definitely following the links and footnotes and making up your own mind before making any big decisions. Baptism and trying it out isnt a big deal but converting marrying and moving to the U.S.in a short period of time would be pretty dramatic change so you should know what its about.If you like him but not his church you might just ask if having the same religion as his spouse is important to him. You never know. Some people serve missions due to family and social pressure without strong belief and theres  of us mostly members who left so he may not stay on that traditional Mormon path.Best of luck. You seem like a very sincere hopeful person. I hope you find love with him or someone else.Edit adding direct links to some of the Portugese essays on LDS church website. There are several more if you follow www.mormonessays.comEdit  to me this information mostly in quotes from the journals of these women and their families are reason enough to know Joseph Smith wasnt a good man and would not have been a prophet.

7652242,0,t3_4k3m51,tldr  Moving slowly on this is how Kevin Worthen keeps his job.Everybody already pretty much knows how this ends.  The university ends up with an Honor Code amnesty clause similar to other universities and the current shared computer system between the Title IX and Honor Code offices will be split so there isnt automatic sharing between them.  If they share staff or physical office space or other equipment like copiers thatll be split up too.Since we all kinda know thats where this is going it can be frustrating to watch it move so slowly.  Its been weeks and weeks and theyve just now formed the committee.So why is it taking so long?  Its to provide cover for university administrators from honor code extremists and apologists.  Imagine that instead of this drawn out committee process Kevin Worthen just decided to make the executive decision to separate the Title IX and Honor Code offices as outlined above.  The Honor Code staff and other staunch Honor Code defenders including ultra TBM donors would cry out that hes caving to popular secular pressure.  Shunting the decision to a committee lets him deflect criticism.  If honor code diehards complain he can say We put in a process to study the issue carefully and make the most balanced policy possible.,exmormon,d3c0muw,27,t5_2r0gj

7678086,0,t3_4kfofn,Story time! A few summers ago I had a smores night in my backyard with neighbors. We were out back for so long the fire completely died out. I never ever walk away from a fire without dumping water on it had a childhood friend die in a house fire but when we walked everyone out of the yard the coals were so dark I never even thought about them. I also have a lid to the fire pit that I didnt put on.Next morning Im looking out of my kitchen window and what Im seeing isnt making sense. The bark in my flower bed was smoking and there was a huge puddle of water in the back. I went out back and just stood there trying to figure out what happened. This is how the timeline appeared to go. It got windy in the night. My fire reignited. Instead of blowing embers towards my flower bed next to the house they were blown to the flower bed away from the house. The bark caught on fire. My pile of firewood caught on fire. My peach tree got singed. The heat from the fire melted the lid of a sprinkler system box. Fire melted a hole in the pvc pipe this sprinkler zone had not worked for years. I hadnt even remembered that there was a box under the bark. The water welled up and put the fire out. One of the things that made this all so incredibly lucky is that the barked area that caught on fire is huge. Its full of trees and goes up next to the shed which had containers of gas in it. Next to the shed is my chicken coop and then a  acre pasture which had been full of crispy dried grass at the time. It could have been an absolute disaster. When I told my story to coworkers the next day one of them said Its a good thing you pay your tithing! I just replied or something!  since I hadnt been. I thought it was such a weird thing for him to say. If there is interest I can upload pics of the melty sprinkler box and my singed peach tree.,exmormon,d3eybc4,2,t5_2r0gj

Thats basically what the NSA said to defend their bull shit that they would only use it to catch people being bad and if you have nothing to hide then why do you care? A flawed line of reasoning that undermines the very basic idea that we as humans are entitled to personal privacy be it from the Government religion or fellow humankind. We forfeit our privacy only when our actions have lead us to impair on personal freedom of someone else. Thats why what Snowden did is commendable and why I think what Anon did with Ashley Madison was reprehensible. Snowden proved the NSA was guilty while Anon made us prove our innocence.

I then called them up and talk to them in person or took them out to lunch etc... Not having one doesnt affect you. Having a good one can help you. Having a bad one can hurt you. Its a tool that is over emphasized by many people. Nothing trumps direct human interaction. The top thing to worry about is your social media presence.  You need to make sure that anything searchable that an employer might find is positive.   I know quite a few people who were eliminated from a job for having a nonprofessional image or tagline in their FB profile picture.  Delete your FB account if needed when searching for a job.

A man was always weak afterward and probably suffered permanent internal organ damage. And they all died younger than the average age for their time. So when people fetishize their suffering I get angry. The truth is they were sold a bill of goods for no good reason. Zion wasnt saved by their arriving before the next summer. It literally would have made no difference if theyd waited. Maybe the leadership thought they would have to spend more money to put them up for another winter back East so they pushed to make everyone leave late with bad equipment. The church tells this as a story about faith. Its half right. Its about faith and the betrayal of faith. These people believed when they were promised that God would protect them. Many died. The rest bore scars physical and emotional for the rest of their lives. But the church trots them out every year in lessons always including the random old man who swears that nobody in the Martin company ever left the church another lie by the way. ,exmormon,d3jt7cr,2,t5_2r0gj

Righteousness is judged by exterior measures and keeping up appearances is the most important thing. Different people have different values based on gender skin color or sexual orientation. Theres one right way to live and thats the only way to be happy. A personal moral compass is far less important than obedience to the prophet. Seriously save your babies and run.

7853474,0,t3_4mt7iu,Ok.  I deleted my last post because though I wasnt intentionally being harsh it might have sounded that way.  Plus I decided I could offer this up in a better way. I think there are absolutely positive ways to help family.  I think there are appropriate times and situations where money is the right thing to give.  I know there are ways to positively influence change in the lives of others and that sometimes that might include giving money or time or attention in order to promote that change.  I would say that your situation doesnt qualify as any of these.  Codependence is something the church promotes.  After all in order to be a faithful member you have to be totally reliant on the externals.  Totally reliant on leaders and really not reliant at all on your own ability to reason things for yourself.  You have to be totally reliant on the teachings totally reliant on your own faith to bring about miracles.  Those are all externals  and only a few.There are appropriate ways to help your inlaws  without enabling them and their belief system.  The idea presented below about getting ward members or missionaries to share in the work is completely worth exploring.  But giving money from your own pocket without including ways for them to change the way they manage their money will only promote harsh feelings and keep them holding on unrealistically to the idea that GOD is behind your goodness.  And it will keep you thinking you have to make up for what the church so willingly takes.  Thats your choice but if its one you resent the best thing is to find another way.And this is mostly likely a deeper issue than just the church taking what isnt theirs. Its easy to blame the church but your inlaws choose to put themselves in a rocky financial position  and to put you potentially in that position too  by not dealing with reality.  Encourage them or have a financial analyst encourage them to revisit how they give.  And think carefully how your assistance can either present the opportunity for them to change or keep them and you stuck in an unhealthy cycle.  Its a touchy thing.  Im a recovering enabler myself  and have also had to face my own moneymanaging inadequacies.  But had I not done that Id be in a world of hurt.  Maybe point them to conference talks by GAs that remind people to live within their means and to give within those too.  I remember hearing those  I know they exist.  Short of that hand them over to a financial planner or maybe have them simplify in other ways so they can give without feeling strapped.  Just a few ideas.  I hope you figure this out.  I know it complicates things further when youre exmo.  Good luck.  ,exmormon,d3ysuc6,1,t5_2r0gj

This could cost the Church tens of millions of dollars. The Church has always denied that financial considerations have played a role. However in  the taxexempt status of Bob Jones University was withdrawn revoked retroactively to  because it did not allow blacks.

The RLDS is way better and more moral than the LDS from this outsiders perspective but that doesnt make Joseph any less a polygamist Emma knew she was protecting Joe. There are multiple accounts and piles of evidence on this matter of both her knowledge and his attempts to conceal because the LDS people were prolific journal writers. I actually think the RLDS CoC is a lovely church from what I know but Joseph was a scam artist and a philanderer there were no golden plates and he did not have any divine powers or gifts of translation. The beauty that came out of the BOM is because great people got suckered in not because of anything noble about Joseph Smith.

7960355,0,t1_d4at4c6,Its really easy to get the Mormon churchs official positions on things. Id say where an AMA really shines is getting an actual Mormons position on things.It wouldnt make sense for lay members of the church who disagree with the November policy changes to claim that they agree with it or to present it in a good light. Tons of active members dislike the November policy and thats got to be interesting on some level to nonMormons. If they wanted someone to present that stuff in a good light then theyd need more official church spokespeople.I didnt see it as much as a member but as an exmormon who has been out for almost a decade I see this stuff move around a lot. Member adherence to the word of wisdom changes all of the time. Things like the way the church approaches masturbation or association with sensitive groups or reading antiMormon materials changes all of the time too.

If she can accept that you wont go to church anymore or hold callings and pay tithing and you can accept that she remain active in the church for whatever reason without questioning or pressuring her it is not a bad deal.  Thats the arrangement that my wife and I have now.  As for the kids it would probably be best to just let her raise them in the LDS church and make the burden completely on her.  As the kids get older provide other options for activities on Sunday.  Tell them that youre going to do this or that and ask if they want to go to church or do something else with you.

Where is that darn spiritual cave? Also no archaeology done at the site. The church isnt going to search for something they know isnt there amp that will prove the actual truth.    According to the account of Brigham Young the angel instructed Joseph Smith to carry the golden plates back to the hill Cumorah. When Smith and Oliver Cowdery arrived the hill opened and they walked into a cave in which there was a large and spacious room. The account continues by saying they found more plates than probably many wagon loads they were piled up in the corners and along the walls. When they first entered the Sword of Laban was hanging on the wall. When they reentered later the Sword of Laban was unsheathed and resting on top of the newly delivered golden plates. The sword had an inscription on it that said the sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ.

This also implies that Africa was repopulated after the flood from the Middle East ie with descendants of the eight people on the ark and I think it hints by Egyptus since these nascent Egyptians were black and Africans are black.This one theme besides being insultingly racist is contrary to so much of what is well known about Egypt and Africa.And I did it without papaya papyri whatever.,exmormon,d4heflk,6,t5_2r0gj

This was before the essay and most of the class had never heard of it and many tried to argue with him on the truth of what he was telling them.  The people who had heard the story heard it from south park and even most of them were surprised to learn it was true.Like our dear brother Uchtdorf here he attempted to make us feel better about the seer stones ridiculousness by comparing it to other ridiculous objects that were just as weird in other religions and even in our own.  Moses had a stick he liked to carry around and he did some super weird magic stuff with it banged it on a rock to get water etc. but we dont think thats weird because we grew up with it.We were supposed to think the rock was less weird but I just started thinking the other stuff was just more weird like whats with Moses magic wizard staff and is the only reason I dont think thats insane because I grew up with it?

They never knew which clothes were clean and which were dirty because they never put anything away and everything ended up on the floor.I told them I was done doing their laundry they all knew how to run the machines themselves and from then on would be responsible for doing their own laundry. My youngest being the stubbornest shithead I know decided to fight me by wearing the same clothes to school for a week. DFS called me. I told them what I was doing and told them they have plenty of clothes they are not being neglected they are just being lazy. Unless they wanted to come wash their clothes for them eventually something or someone would embarrass them enough to bother washing their clothes they were showering daily just didnt care about grungy clothes. There was only a few days left before summer vacation. The DFS lady laughed it off and told me as long as theyd learned the lesson before coming back to school in the fall there wouldnt be an issue.

I think I always knew deep down I was gay but I really wasnt ready to admit it to myself until I was . The way the church treated gays for me put a big crack in my shelf even if I wasnt ready to admit to myself that I was gay I was big on gay rights and their stance on porn helped too. After I came out to my family I found myself less and less taken in by the whole thing. A couple years after I came out I actually properly joined the fandom made a character started going to the local coffee meetups. I had gotten pretty disillusioned with the church at this point and seeing all these people like me living in sin and perfectly happy despite what LDS corp had been telling me about how everybody who isnt in the church is a sad moral degenerate was what really finally broke my shelf.

My point with that other comment is that we shouldnt pretend that the goal is to simply get people to think more carefully about their beliefs. Thats the strategy. The goal is to convert people to atheism. My point in calling atheism problematic was not to suggest that I think there is something malignant about it. Rather that I think there are some fairly heavy philosophical issues with the idea of a Universe that just exists for no reason  an idea that when thought about carefully leads to paradoxes that arent so easily resolved by invoking Occams Razor or putting the burden of proof on the theist or exclaiming God of the Gaps! Explaining why would take more time than I have. But my point is that atheism is not necessarily the end result of careful thought on the subject and so if our goal is to get people to think more careful about this subject they would challenge atheists as well.,exmormon,d4mq6d2,1,t5_2r0gj

Until you have a better idea of her reactions and the issues with the kids it might be good to not make this the first big fight. It might be worth gritting your teeth a bit longer.How many of these issues have you thought about and discussed with your wife? The church will be teaching your children that you are a lazy sinner caught up by satan. There was just a post here about a group of boys who couldnt have breakfast at a youth camp until every one of them bore his testimony. Seminary teachers are now being trained to evade questions and gaslight their pupils in another post recently. Your girls will be taught shame about their bodies the boys taught shame over sexuality too. Tithing from your household funds will be used to buy real estate not help the poor with no accountability or transparency.This list is endless and every point on it is a negotiating point with your wife. Can she really let her children be told you are evil if she loves you? Is that fair to you? And of course she has a long list of points also starting with you being the one who chose this new path.You and she have a lot of thinking and deciding to do.

I think its very difficult for some of the younger people to believe what went on. I have stories to tell that would blow your socks off.

In your depression episodes you wanted to be happy.Now remove a major cause of the depression in the cult and you start being happy with who you are.  Your desire for some outside event to make you happy is gone because you already are happy internally. Eventually if you are in lasting loving relationship the desire to kids may come back.  Instead of having them because it is the only way to be happy as mormonism teaches it will be because you are happy and want to give them the same thing. ,exmormon,d51dpt5,3,t5_2r0gj

Im afraid shes going to blab to the world and his family is big at gossip too.Since all this has happened the last few weeks he hasnt really had to deal with others talking because they dont know yet.I have this fear that a few single moms in our ward will see him as a worthy priesthood holder and he will want someone else who is more in line with what he believes.

I hesitate to confront them because my dad grew up in an extremely abusive and neglegent environment and theres a good chance hell flip shit like never before if I accuse them of doing something that affected me so negatively since I know they had good intentions.Yeah thats my dad too. I had to learn to forgive myself first then forgive my dad so that his abusiveness to me no longer controlled my reactions to things. It took me a long time but I was eventually able to forgive him but I dont forget.The interesting thing is that my dad doesnt remember that he ever abused us at all so accusations would simply make him angry or confused. He must have pushed all that stuff into the back of his head and tried to forget.Several years after that incident the sad thing now is that my dad isnt the same person anymore. I honestly doubt if he remembers our childhoods at all. He has very selective memory and while he occasionally makes a lasersharp insight that I hadnt even considered he is just a shell of a man now.I dont think there is value in confronting them about it. I realize that my dad was raised in an eve more abusive household than I was a sister did a personal history project on him and that due to the teachings of the religion they were doing the best they knew how with the available information. I completely disagree with their methods and raised my kids completely different but I think all we can do is to try to raise each generation to be better than the last.

Also DampC  totally justify the use of divining rods. God says he made them work for Oliver.Lastly the BoA. Yikes.Each of these understood in context present a version of Mormonism totally at odds with what we were all taught and with what is currently being taught.

8275994,0,t3_4st6qd,maybe its just me that has zero confidence in my fashion senseIm in the same boat. I also feel very overwhelmed by all the choices which can be really frustrating. I would start by asking friends where they shop this can give you an idea of where to start. Then Id check out online some websites that will allow you to make your own outfit. This gives you the freedom to explore on your own your likesdislikes....and possibly feedback from others if you choose to share the outfit publically???The websites also categorize the clothing so youll be able to browse the cocktail and casual dresses separately. When you do go shopping either bring a trusted fashion friend or your phone. If you only have your phone you can text pictures of the clothing youre preparing to purchase to get a second opinion. Lastly dont pressure yourself to buy something. If you dont find anything at the store that you really liked  its ok to come again another day. This website lists  websites that can help with finding useful apps to help you along your way. Once you become more comfortable with trusting yourself in choosing what to wear the easier it will become. Hope this helps and good luck! !!,exmormon,d5c23e1,2,t5_2r0gj

His perspective is that the cult is still controlling his life even though he loves me and I him.As of right now it looks like were headed for a separation. As someone who is probably not your wife and someone whose husband said almost this exact thing to me I have this to sayIt is painful. I feel angry rejected depressed hurt and defensive. Im scared about a future without this man that I love very much. However I understand where hes coming from. Even though this other woman has acted as catalyst for his feelings I know its not actually about her. It still creeps up in my mind though that if only I had been more like her this wouldnt be happening. But thats personal bullshit that doesnt apply here. Ive been reading Conscious Uncoupling and thats been helping me shift my opinion of relationship ends and divorce. As much as I dont want to lose my relationship with my husband I have to realize that this is what he needs to process this difficult journey out of the church. Im trying not to be selfish. What has really helped me react as positively and nontoxically as I can in all this is his complete honesty. Its been hard to hear at times because I want to react defensively or hurt him like hes hurt me by admitting his confusion over his feelings for me and his being drawn to this other woman. But hes been honest and forthcoming and thoughtful in his delivery and thats helped me to process this without filling in the blanks with all of the bullshit my brain wants to fill in.

8335177,0,t1_d5j8et4,Ill let others make recommendations but the short version is that although the LDS Church currently only allows members to have one legal spouse at a time it puts no limit on how many women that a man can be sealed to.  If a LDS man was sealed to his first wife and then gets divorced or widowed he can also be sealed to his second and third fourth etc. wife.LDS women on the other hand can only be sealed to one husband.  If a woman was sealed before and now wants to remarry she needs a sealing cancelation a spiritual annulment to be free to be sealed again.Moreover LDS doctrine states that polygamy is necessary to be exalted in the Celestial Kingdom but it has a loophole that men can take additional wives in the CK.

You have for some reason Ben able to save a little over   you are doing better than a lot of adults who are older than you. You are smart and connected enough to your own thoughts feelings and opinions to have uncovered the fraud that is the church understand that it is harming you AND make a decision to leave it behind. What is really cool about that is you are only  and moving into a post Mormon life a whole lot earlier than  of us exmormons here on Reddit. You are actually ahead of the game.. You had the balls to follow through and actually tell your parents that your are not having it the balls to refuse to see the bishop and the balls to defy them and work on Sunday. . You have a job so that means you know how to work. I know You feel like you are missing a lot of the pieces of successful adulthood but you actually have enough to get started. Successful adulthood is a journey not a destination. ALL of us are still getting there. If anyone says they have arrived they are trying to sell you something and they are lying. . Consider the possibility that if you are truly mentally ill it may be actually be a whole lot worse than it it has to be because of the situation you are in. The people and institutions you are surrounded by makes a difference.  You will be more mentally healthy if you remove yourself from a toxic environment or institutions where you are unable to really be who you are. When I went through this I was a single parent with no car no money no confidence no job no emotional stability no one rooting for me. If I could do it you certainly can. You are further along in successful adulthood than I was back then. You can do it saxman. It is a mental game. It will be hard but you already know you can deal with hard stuff.

The  step program was just a bunch of guiltshaming etc. Theyd tell us to access the atonement through various acts of public and private humiliation. In the counselling center group meeting they taught us about the Shame cycle and how our shame for pornmasturbation was fueling the downward spiral of compulsion. The woman leading the group meeting was very adamant that we not call it an addiction but a compulsion.  I think she was NOM or something because seriously she steered pretty much all of us in that group to the conclusion that the problem wasnt us but the shame that was placed on us for those perfectly normal behaviors.

8421004,0,t1_d5u3in6,gt Mormonism is AFAIC the least reflective thoughtful and insightful of any Christian faith. It spends no time on digging into human behaviorI laugh when exmos say ignorant horseshit like I left all of religion because Mormonism is the most logical religion and if that doesnt ultimately hold up than nothing else will. Make no mistake all supernatural claims of miracles and revelations are extremely dubious. But of the options that are out there Mormonism is objectively by far one of the illogically internally inconsistent materially falsifiable and flatout dumb religions around. Not all religions are made equal and Mormonism is definitely one of the shallowest and stupidest on offer. The only reason any exmo thinks otherwise is because they are either ignorant of the philosophical depth and artistic beauty in some traditions or because they are still suffer from the residual brainwashing of their youth clogging up the arteries in their brain.

It happens in every war to help soldiers kill people. Objectification usually evokes an assiocated slanderous name like japs or commies. People who are branded with these names are assumed to represent a set of negative values which arent necessarily based on their personal character. How is calling exmos antimormons any different? The church has created an enemy who doesnt deserve the decency of being heard or payed attention to. Members of the church are encouraged to avoid the antimormons and their ideas like an inferior class of people. To the church an Antimormon has gained nothing and has lost everything was once worthy and is now unworthy was once delightsome but is now disgusting. How can this not be seen as hate? It is the opposite of love.   edit we self identify as exmormons. I believe antimormon is thier own creation,exmormon,d5z2qo9,4,t5_2r0gj

8509117,0,t3_4w897n,Im sorry youve received such a negative response here. But can you really blame us for being a bit touchy when it comes to the church? Weve all made huge life decisions with perspectives centered on the truthfulness of the church. Church teachings caused us to feel profound guilt and shame for doing very normal human things. Many of us have dedicated our entire lives to the church. So when we realize that the antiMormon literature we were warned about is closer to the actual history than what the church taught andor that we no longer believe in the church altogether its often deeply painful and distressing. Given that you must understand that when you come to rexmormon bearing your testimony to us knowing full well that most of us were once recommendcarrying members it feels antagonistic. It feels like youre telling us our feelings of betrayal anguish and anger arent valid or justified.So of course people in this thread are reacting with vitriol. Of course theyre making negative assumptions about who you are as a person. You believe in the church and thats great for you but if you shake a bees nest you shouldnt be surprised when you get stung...And I think its worth mentioning that many of us already feel some measure of resentment toward Mormons due to how some treated us during our faith transitions away from the LDS Church.

Caution Against the Golden Bible. NewYork Telescope  no.   February  .CAUTION AGAINST THE GOLDEN BIBLE.The editor of the Palmyra Freeman declared in his paper of August th asfollows The Golden Bible is the greatest piece of superstition that has ever come within the sphere of our knowledge.gtIn the Investigator No.  Dec.  I published by way of caution a letter of Oliver H.P. Cowdry in answer to my letter to Joseph Smith Jun. Martin Harris and David Whitmorethe believers in said bible of gold plateswhich they affirm they have miraculously or supernaturally beheld. I sought for evidences and such as could not be disputed of the existence of this bible of golden plates. But the answer wasthe world must take their words for its existence and that the book would appear this month.gtThe editor of the Palmyra Freeman their neighbor adds to the above that in the fall of  Joseph Smith of Manchester Ontario county reported he had been visited in a dream by the spirit of the Almighty and informed that in a certain hill in that town was deposited this Golden Bible containing an ancient record of a divine nature and origin. After being thrice visited thus as he states he proceeded to the spot and found the bible with a huge pair of spectacles. He had been directed however not to let any mortal being examine them i.e. the plates and the stoneeyed spectacles under no less penalty than instant death!! It was said that the leaven of the bible were plates of gold about eight inches long six inches wide and oneeighth of an inch thick. i.e.  plates are one inch thick  long and  wide. gtOn these plates were characters or hieroglyphics engraved. The whole of the plates are said to weigh about thirty pounds which would be in gold near eight thousand dollars beside the value of the engraving.One of Joseph Smiths proselytes is continues the Palmyra Freeman Martin Harris an honest and industrious farmer of Palmyra. He is said to have shown some of these characters to Professor Samuel L. Mitchell of this city who could not translate them. Martin Harris returned and set Joseph Smith to the business of translating them who by placing the spectacles in a hat and looking into them Joseph Smith said he could interpret these characters.The editor of the Palmyra Freeman describes Joseph Smith as not being very literate and that his translation is pronounced by his proselytes to be superior in style and more advantageous to mankind than our holy bible!gtI have this month received sixteen pages of this work from page  to  inclusive. I cannot perceive any superiority of style in this specimen nor any evidence that this bible is not a book of Joseph Smiths own manufacture. His title page professed that he was the author of it and this declaration is evidenced by its style. For in these sixteen pages I noticed yea was repeated  times and even  times in two pages. The words It came to pass is repeated  times in  pages and even ten times on one page. Now and behold are reiterated near the commencement of sentences full thirtytimes apiece and more in these sixteen pages. Consequently these four things are repeated  times on the eardrum while speaking of the war of the Nephites and Lemanites in the day of Moroni and reign of the judges according to the Book of Alma.gtThus in page  it is writtenYea verily verily I say unto you if all men had been and were and ever would be like unto Moroniyea the devil would never have no power over the hearts of the children of men never to have no power is ever to have some power. Behold he was a man like unto Ammon the son of Mosiah yea and even the other sons of Mosiah yea and also Alma and his sons. Whether this style is equal to our scripture style the reader can judge.gtAgain in pages  amp  it reads thus And those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him as we must needs suppose. That a weak faith ends this sentence is manifest.Again page  is writtenAnd there was but few which denied the covenant of freedom. Was should have been were.Again And there were some who died with fevers which at some seasons of the year was were very frequent.gtAgain in the next pageAnd it came to pass that they would not or the MORE part would not obey ampc. The following is the title page of the Golden Bible as published in the Palmyra FreemanThe Book of Mormon an account written by the hand of Mormon upon plates taken from the plates of NephiWherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi and also of the Lamanites written to the Lamanites which are a remnant of the house of Israel and also to Jew and Gentile written by way of commandment and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation written and sealed and hid up unto the Lord that they might not be destroyed.to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereofsealed up by the hand of Moroni and hid up unto the Lord to come forth in due time by way of the Gentilethe interpretation thereof by the gift of God an abridgment taken from the book of Ether.gtAlso which is a record of the people of Jared which were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people when they were building a tower to get to Heaven which is to shew unto the remnant of the house of Israel how great things the Lord hath done for their fathers and that they may know the covenants of the Lord that they are not cast off forever and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ the Eternal God manifesting himself unto all nations. And now if there by fault it be the mistake of men wherefore condemn not the things of God that ye may be found spotless at the judgment seat of Christ.By JOSEPH SMITH Junior Author and Proprietor.gtThus we are informed that this Book of Mormon was written i.e. engraved by the hand of Mormon on plates taken from the plates of Nephiwherefore it is not a transcript but what a strange conclusion an abridgement of the record of Nephi ampc. If so why is it not called the record of Nephi? But what is also strange this record is written by way of commandment and also and or also is here useless by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation what an uncommon record of past and known events to the Nephites! sealed and hid up unto the Lord sealed up by the hand of Moronian abridgement taken from the book of Ether. Instead of being hid up it was hid down inthe earth of a hill or in a stone reservoir. It was first said to be an abridgement of the record of Nephi but it is now said to be an abridgement taken from the book of Ether. Also which is a record of the people of Jared ampc. to teach Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ the Eternal God. But lastly Joseph Smith jun. declares he is the author of this book of Mormon this record of Nephi this book of Ether this record of Jareds people who were scattered at the building of the tower of Babel this convincing work which is to convert Jew and Gentile to believe that Jesus is the eternal God. Surely our missionaries should take notice of this! Now if there be fault it be the mistake of men says J.S.gtThis title page is another specimen of superior style in which one is soon lost and wonders what J. Smith means or how can all that is written by the author be true!These facts are given to caution people not to spend their money uselessly for a book that is more probable a hoaxor a moneymaking speculationor an enthusiastic delusion than a revelation of facts by the Almighty.

This is especially effective after having separated the sexes from puberty onward and teaching them different things.When my wife and I left the Church and started talking about stuff we couldnt believe what different things we had been taught. Worlds apart.You have both been conditioned into certain roles and may not even have talked about that. Its a journey for both of you. You both need to learn to set and maintain boundaries.Also if you are both born in the Church you will have to figure out who you are and what matters to you. That too is something of a journey for both of you. The only advice I can give you is to communicate while you figure it all out.

Henotheism is a form of polytheism that acknowledges that people in other places legitimately worship a different god or their god is not our god.Prior to the Babylonian conquest Israel was a polytheistic nation nation meaning identity not state that developed among the regional Canaanite population.  During the exile the Pentateuch was first developed by the henotheists of the cult of YWYH a God borrowed from the Canaanite god of war and deliverance.  It reflects the narrative that favors the Isrealites as the people of YWYH.   Judaisms identity further developed and monotheistic Judaism was developed by the fourth century BCE.  Most of the rest of its founding scripture the Tanakh was recorded during the fourth century BCE as the monotheists won the struggle for the beliefs of the people and the Judean population transitioned from monalatry to monotheism and the  monotheistic canon set the religious tradition that would prevail. ,exmormon,d6m6s26,1,t5_2r0gj

He acts like any other nonMormon single  year old would be fine with being single at . He and other apostles caused the angst in this woman and now are trying to act like they are helping single people be okay but not totally okay with their singleness. Telling her that Gods timing is being done isnt helpful but he who is married thinks it is comforting.

I imagine youve heard similar things too. She knows it isnt right but that thought cant fully compute yet.Just be awesome. Be there for her and when she fully wakes up to the abuse the church is giving to her by forcing her to choose between dogma and her family shell probably thank you for it someday.

We had the discussion in preparation meetings a few times about the names getting online and when giving an alternate was suggested it was widely agreed that old people have a hard enough time with keeping one straight that two wouldnt work.

In these situations he needs to stfu and just listen to everyone here whove been abused who went to church leaders and were told to repent. In my case I was in college and I told the bishop that I was  when it happened and that my step dad was sent to jail for it.  So is the church going to step up now and claim I had some responsibility?  I spent from age  to when I left hearing that and believing them. My bishop testified against my step dad and now an apostle was telling me and everyone else to hold up lets go through everything again we might have missed something.  Heres what I think most abuse victims are women and the church hates women. By default we did something to deserve whatever happened to us even after hearing my age and the prison sentence.  Nope. I bear some responsibility  read the Miracle of Forgiveness and lets talk. Or I leave the church and we shame this bullshit victim blaming out of them. It needs to go the way of slavery.

8855379,0,t3_51iija,Uchtdorf makes the following claims with respect to why you should join up The Mormon church was restored in our day by Jesus Christ Himself. Put another way Mormonism was established by a powerful kolobian superbeing with powers of levitation teleportation and telepathy. Please support this and other associated extraordinary claims. Lots of religious organizations make similar extraordinary claims. Dont merely assert them to me the disbeliever actually do the work to explain why should I believe them. He hasnt done that. Mormonism provides opportunities for doing good.A host of other organizations provide opportunities for doing good many provide opportunities for doing more good.On a related note just this week I took my kids to play at a playground at a local Episcopal Church. They maintain the playground. Its very nice. And its explicitly open to the public. And it sent my mind to thinking about how generous a public service it is. Not only that but the church itself is beautiful architecurally. Its of a style fit for the area. I also thought of Catholic hospitals and so on. How many such things are owned and maintained by the Mormon church with explicit and nostringsattached offersofuse to the public? And look at Mormon chapels. Theyre basically all the same...everywhere. With no thought of enhancing the look of an area or complimenting the architectural aesthetic of the surroundings. Theyre boring mundane buildings.And all that is without mentioning the proportion of public good and humanitarian aid offered by the church compared to other churches its not that great and youd think it could be pretty good considering all the money they probably save building the same boring buildings everywhere. Walking the path of descipleship leads to precious blessings.He begins this explanation with talk of getting baptized. A rite that depends on ones confession of belief in several extraordinary claims. See item .He then spends time talking about how the church is made of imperfect people whove made mistakes. And how people can mistakenly on his view disbelieve the claims of the church because of the imperfection of its members. Hes confusing the issue here. Its not merely that were hung up on some mistakes members have made. Rather its the nature of the mistakes. The church is endorsing extraordinary claims about the universe and demanding a high level of commitment of adherents. The mistakes at issue undermine the credibility of the people making the extraordinary claims. Furthermore the best available evidence aside from the mere claims of the churchs founding leaders fails to adequately support the claims at issue.Uchtdorf seems like a nice enough guy but this was a talk for members not a talk for people out or on the way out. He completely fails to adequately address the issues.Thats what you tell your Bishop.,exmormon,d7cahur,3,t5_2r0gj

The ones baptizing over a hundred were baptizing teenage girls.  And when you would hear them speak Korean you could tell why.  Korean men and women speak differently  some missionaries would end up talking like a girl because they spent all their time talking to girls.I was a BP twice and BP counselor in every other area except the only ward I served in rd ward.

8868392,0,t3_51ppig,Honestly while some of the components of marijuana have been shown to be effective for some medical conditions you will have a hard time finding a serious doctor who would actually recommend medical marijuana.  The problem comes down to quality control dosing and lack of serious published studies on efficacy and safety the data out there is all rather preliminary due to difficulties with legalitylegitimacy of large scale placebo controlled trials.  If you are using medical marijuana you honestly dont know how much you are actually using and how pure the product is therefore it will never be popular with physicians.  That being said if you find it beneficial many doctors will be willing to write a prescription you leave the office happy and they get paid and there is no doubt people experience a benefit even if it is just placebo effect.  When I was doing clinical medicine before I jumped ship to my laboratory I didnt give a fuck if my patients were smoking marijuana.  I did however find it ridiculous that everyone was trying to justify their recreational habit with pseudoscientific reasoning.  I dont think marijuana should be illegal very libertarian but I find the whole medical marijuana movement to be a little silly.

I ended up having two tubal ectopic pregnancies and lost both of my Fallopian tubes so the only avenue open to us was to try IVF.  We were able to have our son on the first try.  We froze  embryos for later.  When the time came to implant them we were not successful in getting pregnant.  So we borrowed another  from our families and tried another IVF cycle.  That didnt work either.  We were torn.  Do we borrow even more money to try another cycle of IVF or do we finally get off the infertility roller coaster and call it quits?  We felt bad about quitting  after all our PBs said that we would have children  but we simply could not afford another try.

9007302,0,t1_d7u4dru,Its from Solomons temple. I think there is a bigger problem than simply stealing from the Old Testament. If you look at Moses message it was about equality. Everybody had an equal share of land. The prophet Samuel made it crystal clear by accepting kings the people rejected the law of Moses. Jesus had no place for the temple except as a place for ordinary people to gather. The brazen sea was a symbol of all that was wrong with the temple it was a place of symbolic purification for an elite. The elite take your money to build expensive buildings monuments to their pride. they then symbolically wash themselves cleansing the OUTER vessel while remaining corrupt inside. As if washing them could make them holy! Jesus spoke about this its the inside that counts not the outside. So I think OP is spot on. The golden Moroni and the golden calf as well as the temple baptismal font all represent the same thing salvation through rituals that tie you to an elite who steal all your stuff. It is the opposite of Jesus message. And for the record I think Paul and hence Pauline Christianity was dead wrong but thats another topic,exmormon,d7ujbrz,9,t5_2r0gj

9037543,0,t3_541unr,Great open comment and question. Im a lifelong still active member. Lived the full life. Served a mission. Married in the temple. Kids. Leadership positions at church etc. etc. etc. years ago I learned for the first time that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy and polyandry. I learned about false claims around the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham. That lead me to study the doctrine more deeply which has ultimately lead to my position today. I no longer believe the church is true as I was taught to believe growing up. I can only describe it as learning that your spouse has been lying to you for the past  years. Shes still a great person. She has a lot of friends. Shes kind. Shes funny. Shes fun to be around. But...she lied to you for  years. During that time you gave EVERYTHING to her. Thats what hurts. Heres the best summary of all the historical and current issues with the church the leads to a lot of the anger you see here. None of us want to be angry. Were here because were working through it. I reached my anger peak about a year ago and Im slowly improving. I admire your upbringing and your perspective. Mormons are great people no question. The church like any church is full of flaws and skeletons in the closet. I was just always taught that my church was different. So Ive learned that there is more man and less God in mormonism than I was lead to believe. That hurts. ,exmormon,d7y63r4,15,t5_2r0gj

Not just because of the questions in the Letter which are powerful on their own and blew any thoughts we had of the truth of the BOM away but because of the way the church treated the author.I know we wouldnt have gone back especially after the policy went from being a secret entry in a dusty manual to revealed doctrine but the CES Letter helped put to rest any concerns we had about tearing our shelf down and taking it with us as we walked out the door.,exmormon,d7ylwth,5,t5_2r0gj

Never did get over the weirdness of the True Order of Prayer. Sisters veiling faces? Disturbing handshakes with my mom? A totally routine prayer chanted in unison? Wha?Anyway there will always be moments in your life when you have to face down everyone you know and love to do what you think is right. Personally. Professionally. With family and friends. Thats just part of being human. You just got to own it and take responsibility. If standing down from your mission is what you want do it. Just dont be an asshole about it. Be the friendly lovable you. The best version of you. And all the drama will pass in time. Sounds like you missed the application rounds for other schools this year. Thats okay. Go to a community college in the meantime. I might recommend just taking a year to volunteer in a nonreligious capacity internationally if you can locally if you have to then building that new experience into your applications next year. I left on a mission out of high school but it didnt hurt me applying as a freshman when I got back. I was just way older than all my classmates. Long story short there are options out there.

9059956,0,t3_54aen0,Also consider that Joseph took other mens wives in the sense that he wasnt just a regular shmuck he was a powerful authority figure.  He held multiple civil authority positions including mayor Lieutenant General of the Nauvoo Legion postmaster etc.  You could argue his illegal marriages were coerced under color of authority.  Of course he was the Prophet of God and the King of the World nd only to Jesus etc.  We know Joseph told some of his prospective wives that their salvation and salvation of their families depended on marrying him.  Who knows what other ways Joseph coerced women to marry him.  Certainly there was intense pressure to obey the Prophet of God.  In that sense he very well may have taken other mens wives against their mental will but they obeyed anyways out of fear or obligation.

This is your only entry route if its cut youre toast..  Avoid conversations where she has to defend the church. i.e. You accuse she tries to rationalize.  It takes finesse but she needs to ask the questions..  Let her set the pace.  Giving her control lets her feel like no one is forcing her to do anything and she is free to reach her own conclusions..  Begin to build a new social support network.  This is critical. Many people will not leave the safety of the fold if they feel like theres nothing on the outside.  Start inviting nonmembers over yesterday.. Patience x .  You love her right? Then you need to do this right.  Let her decide when its time for her shelf to crash dont try to smash it with a sledge hammer.  If she takes it down then you will have a fantastic relationship.  If you smash it down then there will likely be some resentment on her part. I wish you the best on your deprogramming adventure. As far as overall tactics that I find work well.

I was all in and did all asked of me plus went the extra mile in every calling I had.  I was in it because I knew it was true.  I was not active because of the social aspect of it at all but because I thought it was the one true church.  When I found out from finding true church history I was out of there!  I too am still so surprised  months later that my husband does not seem to care about all the history.  When I hear of other people in church who dont believe it it still just blows me away.

And it happens to all of us sometimes in more ways than we can count.However rather than focusing on how Im falling short and getting anxious about my personal failings I take the opportunity to have my eyes opened and seek to do better and do more good with my time assist more people with my efforts and be more sensitive to the needs of others and do what I can to care and to help lift up others.For me this isnt about image or looking like a good person but simply about being good and doing good.  I dont need magic sky grandpas Penishoods or fancy handshakes for any of that.  I just need to get off my ass spent some time andor money and do what I can to make the world a better place.

The husband in this story was considering suicide over his masturbation shame because of a puritanical verse in Alma that many TBMs have twisted to mean all sexual sin is next to murder I believe the church does equal or worse damage to female sexuality because of all the horrible messaging that sex is shameful and bad and it is ludicrous to think that message doesnt leak right over into marriage after spending years programming the brain to think that way. I think its basic emotional conditioning tell a person sex is evil a thousand times and then ring a wedding bell and expect them to forget all that lingering shame and distaste. tscckillsloveThe Mormon Mental Health podcast episode  is pretty great too.

If any of you are inspired go ahead and transcribe another one. I find running the Youtube video at . speed is a great way to get most of it down at my typing speed. Then I ran it at full speed to fix the things that were iffy. Also if any of you can identify the voices I have question marks beside let me know and Ill edit accordingly.Unknown Presenter Could WikiLeaks or a group like WikiLeaks embarrass or damage the church? WikiLeaks describes itself as a notforprofit media organization which provides innovative secure and anonymous ways for independent sources to leak information to journalists. In other words its dedicated to radical involuntary transparency or another way to providing untraceable and uncensorable ways to expose the secrets of governments and corporations.Presenter Says WikiLeaks director yearold Australian Julian Assange Leaking is inherently an antiauthoritarian act. ... We get information in the mail ... vet it like a regular news organization ... release it to the public. Presenter As youve been following front page for the last several weeks US Army Private Bradley Manning contributed to worldwide stir by using a music CD  it wasnt actually this one but it looked something like this  and a drive or several  to transfer hundreds of thousands of confidential US reports on Afghanistan Iraq and US diplomacy to WikiLeaks which then made them public.Presenter Now as you may be aware WikiLeaks is threatening to take down a major American bank. And as youve also seen Bank of America shares fell for a period of time. Everyone assumes that theyre the target.Presenter Three WikiLeaks implications. First headlines to the contrary most analysts agree WikiLeaks revealed no warchanging state secrets. They really had none to reveal though it did breach US diplomatic confidences and chilled future candor. Second in sympathy with WikiLeaks  this is I think a more troubling development  Anonymous a shadowy hackers group coordinated online attacks against Visa MasterCard and PayPal and threatened if WikiLeaks were attacked to unleash Cyber Armageddon. Third publics ask are WikiLeaks groups heroes or anarchists? As often happens a virtue like information freedom can be taken to an extreme and become a vice.Presenter Three possible Church implications First technical attack. Are we sufficiently protected against industrialstrength cyberattacks by wellfunded capable countries or groups which probe the church each day? Let me give you an example. A Russian hacker claims to have broken the encryption which authenticates photographs. In other words he says theres no technical way to show that these photographs are not real. We look at them and we know instantly that they cant be real. You cant have a Russian flag on the moon. But he says if you look at the encryption involved you cant tell technically that theyve been doctored.Presenter Second personnel attack. Breaches often begin with a disgruntled individual on the inside often in a lowerlevel position with access in a remote location. Private Manning reportedly became depressed after his homosexual companion left him and then lectured him. And on his FB page Private Manning wrote I am not a piece of equipment. He said he could access sensitive documents because of weak servers weak logging weak physical facility weak counterintelligence inattentive signals analysis ... a perfect storm. So technical personnel.Presenter Third is the unintended. Do we have appropriate protocols in case of accidental loss or theft of a Church laptop an iPad or a data drive with sensitive information? A question thats worth asking frequently I think.Presenter In the end this we do know And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops and their secret acts are the ones that shall be revealed.Presenter Comments? Questions?Packer Ive forgotten where the sergeant is now.Presenter Hes in solitary confinement. Theyre worried about him committing suicide. I think what theyre trying to do is to build the case that perhaps there was some solicitation of the material. The WikiLeaks people say No no it came to us we had no idea where it was coming from. Its not clear whether thats in fact the case.Ballard? But he is confirmed a homosexual?Presenter He is.Ballard? Openly?Oaks? Has that been in the news?Presenter Yes.? Yes.Presenter New York Times piece.Ballard? I missed that somehow.? Just in the very beginning.? Yup.Presenter There was Elder Oaks initially a concern the possibility that hed been reprimanded for homosexual issues but that was not in the news afterwards. He is I think openly homosexual. And the reports were as Elder Cook was mentioning that his companion left him and he became depressed and that seems to have been based on his Facebook writings one of the features that caused him to do what he did.Oaks The reason I ask the question is not related to this presentation but Im suspicious that the news media cover up anything involving homosexuals when it would work to the disadvantage of the homosexual agenda and so on. And I just wondered if there was some of that in this.Presenter It was in the collateral press and New York Times covered it as well.Oaks Thank youPacker Is it required that all these bright stars that invent all these processes are corrupt?Presenter Surely it must not be the case that everyone who is bright and inviting things is corrupt but clearly some are.Packer Simply be the ones that have ...Presenter My own sense is you listen to this particular man Julian Assange the rhetoric is surely a nice idea that there should be freedom of information. But when you listen to him you get a feel from him you get much more of the anarchist than the freedom fighter.Ballard? Is he gay?Presenter I dont know. He was under indictment as youre alluding to for sexual assault but it seemed to be rape charges that he was coming under not for being gay.Packer Well thank you I think.

Listening to them try to properly diagnose and solve a problems is hilarious.   They might have a decent business sense but when it comes to behavioral economics holy shit they are almost always wrong.  Although I think one thing the video should DEBUNK is the notion that the leaders dont actually believe.  They believe and them literally believing  is going to be their biggest obstacle to making the church grow.

This promise was so great that I  year old Helen willingly gave myself to him.How does this make him a sexual predator?   He was a prophet claimed he saw God and Jesus he wrote some scriptural books.  So duh! he was doing Gods will.  Are you suggesting that he made this all up so that he could take advantage of his position and fulfill his unrighteous desires?   Furthermore there isnt any evidence that he even slept with her and it was normal for a  year old to marry a  year old back then.  Look at his fruits and get back to church.  You know deep down that he was a prophet of God.  I bear you my testimony that through a spiritual witness given to me I KNOW he is a prophet.

While you may think you know the truth so does your friend.  I definitely would not share the letters yet.  Maybe if they ask for further info then you can share the foundation of your belief. Do you value the friendship?  Do you have enough respect for your friend to accept your differences?  Similar advice I provided on your last issue concerning your wife.

9333743,0,t1_d8z1fw6,Ok. As a former believing member I found a lot of comfort talking to nonmormon friends about personal stuff. With Church friends there is a lot of judgment about everything you do. I would have gotten shade from some Mormon friends if theyd known I read romance novels that included sex scenes from time to time for instance considered pornographic. Yet my nevermormon coworkers would openly joke about  Shades of Grey with no shame whatsoever. I often felt much safer talking about stuff like this with nevermo friends. With sex Mormons can be puritanical about it. You will have many Mormons who believe all kinds of sex stuff is a sin even within marriage. On the other hand it is really hard for someone who is a nevermormon to get what this religion means to believing members. It is a highcommitment religion that goes beyond belief. It is in every aspect of her life from her marriage to her parenting her choices about entertainment or career  everything. I didnt realize as a believing member how controlling my religion appeared to others I viewed all of this as my choice based on my personal beliefs and values. It made me defensive to hear people be critical of my religion or choices because it was really important to me and I knew most nonmormons didnt really understand it. In some ways its like people who are in a dysfunctional relationship who choose to stay anyway because they love the other person. There is also pressure to always put the church in the best light to outsiders. Theres such an emphasis placed on missionary work and converting people to the faith. It adds another layer where I always wanted to put my church and faith in the best light even if in reality I was stressed by my calling or had questions etc. I really wanted to make your religion look attractive and perfect and never give anyone the wrong idea about it.So yeah. Your instincts are probably good. She is likely compartmentalizing her friendships and turning to different people for different things. My guess is that you are right that she is using you.

9380677,0,t3_592547,As it has been put here before The Mormon church doesnt have a monopoly on goodness and happiness. gtWhat is life like without the church or even religion in general?Ive found its really the same except you have a lot more free time. The social structure it comes with goes away so you have to put a little more effort into building that yourself. The great part is that you get to choose who you associate with and when. gt How do you know what to do? How do you know what is right?You know these things without someone telling you. The greatest part of teaching your children or acting yourself without religion is that you are doing it for the right reasons. Not for a reward or to avoid punishment. Do you really need someone telling you that you should be nice to other people help those in need and just be an all around good person? I havent been to church in years and I still pulled over to see if someone needed help last week. Why? Because its the nice thing to do. Are there going to be terrible people? Always. Within and outside of religion. Do some people need some guidance? Yes. Does it have to be a strict regimented religion? No. Some people are fine completely independent. Some keep their faith in certain subjects and transition to another communitychurch that is less rigid. Its always great to keep a check on yourself. Others just do it in different ways. And no one group has a monopoly on it. gtI see many evils in this world I dont want my children exposed to or even partcipating in these things so How do I prevent that without the church?The same way you would do it with the church. Your example and every day interactions with them. Your influence on them will always be more impactful than a few hours every week.gtWhat communities do the non religious surround themselves with?In the exmormon way of things they transition to other religions or to nonreligious groups. Community clubs other charities recreational sport teams and just friends they make. gtHow do you live life in such an unstructured way?Your life has structure. You have things you need to do and responsibilities. You have so many hours in the day and you plan what things you need to accomplish in that time. Sometimes you have free time and you can do whatever you want. We all wake up in the morning and usually put our pants on one leg at a time.

9389106,0,t3_594itv,This is actually the crux of my argument as to why Mormonism and Mormon fundamentalism are so dangerous. In a religion where personal revelation is admired and appreciated there can be no orthodoxy. The sorts of revelations which can be received by anyone are truly frightening. The conclusion is inescapable strong reliance on revelation creates an atmosphere where the proclivity for violence can flourish. According to Ronald Enroth a sociology professor at Westmont College nearly all cults insert themselves aggressively into their members lives but the potential to explode depends on the leaders mental health and whether or not the leader can be pushed over the cliff. Keys to watch for are whether the leader has made himself into Gods mouthpiece or God if the group has a strong fortress mentality and to what extent the group has armed itself.C. Jess Grossbeck a psychiatrist at the Utah State Mental Hospital points out thatThe idea of getting ones direction from God is very fundamental to the Mormon way of life. There are certain individuals who have visionary or other kinds of altered statesofconsciousness experiences that have a hallmark of coming from a deity. With a religion like Mormonism there already is a theological structure in place to call upon to explain this phenomenon.,exmormon,d964vws,5,t5_2r0gj

Needs can be defined rather strictly in such a way it only encompasses what is necessary to stay alive no matter how unpleasant the life is. If we do so there are very few needs for human beings. But if we take into account emotional and mental health then needs are a bit broader and may be different from person to person.Introverts for example tend to have a need for less crowds but also for more meaningful intimate relationships. Apply that to marriage and though sex may not be a strict need long term deprivation of intimacy including sex will damage their mental and emotional health. Not in the same immediacy as lack of water will for physical health but over a life of  years living  alone and celibate isnt going to typically be healthy.I agree that not all people have a need for such shared intimacy but that doesnt mean you can call it not a need for everyone because some do have such a need to be emotionally and mentally healthy.,exmormon,d9arbzn,1,t5_2r0gj

He knew the brethren were united and all had the same unchanging truth so it didnt even occur to him that may be he should fact check his stuff or see what correlation thought.

9437764,0,t1_d9b2qeg,There were a few of us that got sent there as punishment as the parents often saw AHS as an educational rehab facility. But most of the students and my friends there were only  of us in the graduating class so we were all forced to be friendsfamily actually wanted to be there as they were brought up in super Mormon homes  a large amount had been homeschooled. So really we were fine with it  and even the ones that were sent there unwillingly had to adapt and eventually be brainwashed to love the place. We always knew we had less freedom than public schools but we somehow didnt mind it because wed try to make the most of what we had. We learned to appreciate being close with our friends and teachers we appreciated not having to deal with nonMormon students and we appreciated the love and attention we received. Yes there were cliques to a certain extent. Although they werent really defined and we often ended up hanging out as a class because there were so few of us.Due to the homework load we rarely hung out on weekdays. We would participate in after school activities to hang out with our friends. We would sometimes hang out on the weekends but because the private school didnt have drivers ed a lot of us didnt know how to drive so we rarely went out. Even when we did hang out on the weekends we all had very strict curfews. Besides theres not much of a nightlife around the area.The one thing that I appreciated from attending AHS was that I felt like I was challenged in my studies. I felt like I was learning something rather than just breezing through high school. Most of us had great test scores that allowed us to get into the colleges of our choice. Looking back on it I didnt have it too hard especially because I had a very different outlook on life back then. But I would never recommend anyone to admit their kids here.,exmormon,d9cawzb,3,t5_2r0gj

9445718,0,t3_59k9as,I wish I could get this through to a person close to me. I am a nevermo and she always has been. She got married at  to an RM they divorced not even a year later because they really werent right for each other. I was the catalyst that somewhat led to the end of their marriage because she and I became very close and had what people would categorize as an emotional affair. Fast forward thru the summer where we did not see or talk to each other to September We are both college students we became close again. We are not dating but hookup every once and a while. At the beginning of the semester we fooled around did everything but sex twice in a couple weeks. She said after the second time that she cannot do that anymore because it goes against the teachings of the church and her belief that she has to be pure. We just recently hookedup last week and in the moment she was way into it but later the next day she was super depressed because she had regressed in trying to become pure again. She says that she cannot take the sacrament anymore and should not be wearing her garments plus she will have to talk to her bishop about the whole situation again so she can become temple worthy once again. I try to point out to her that we are human beings and that sex plus all the other stuff is totally in our nature and that she should not feel bad for having fun. That trying to remain pure is both stupid and unreasonable. That us doing what we did caused no harm to anyone and that we had fun. Then I added why would god give a shit about us fooling around when there are so much more important things heshe could be worrying about? She just responds that it is the churches teachings and it is not how she envisions her future self.It is really frustrating to have a girl that is so into it at the time and then regrets it the next day because it makes me feel like I did something wrong at the time too.Sorry I just had to vent about my sex life haha.,exmormon,d9db874,1,t5_2r0gj

9469793,0,t3_5agkjb,gt Many of you are fine people that are caring and respectful.I think that no matter where you go youre likely to find around the same percentage of people who will fit your totally subjective criteria for caring and respectful. Just because someone is exmormon and not caring and respectful does not necessarily imply that becoming exmormon was the catalyst for that behavior. Correlation does not imply causation. Ive met plenty of active Mormon assholes by my defition of course. Being Mormon does not make them an asshole. Theyre one despite their religion. Leaving the church is unlikely to correct that for them.gt Many of you mock members when they say that leaving the church will make you a worse person.Once again you have no idea what these people youre describing were like while they were still in the church. Youre making an assumption that they were better. Thats a mistake. Thats on you.gt I could never be so disrespectful towards others and their beliefs.I agree with  of this statement. We as human beings deserve respect. We all have rights and privileges. Were free to believe whatever we want. However thats where we deviate. If I believe something ridiculous I deserve and expect to be challenged. Humans deserve respect ideas do NOT. Especially when those ideas are professed to be truth and can be proven scientifically false. Ideas and beliefs need to earn respect through stringent investigation. Also I just want to point out that the phrase I could never makes you sound a little holier than thou. I hope thats not the message you were trying to convey. If it is Ill caution you  that type of attitude is unlikely to be received well anywhere.gt If anything you have pushed my back closer to be a believer.If youre basing the truth of the LDS Church on internet behavior and not facts youre going to have a bad time.gt The humor and the language here jut isnt for me.Im sorry you feel that way but I respect that. Some people process leaving Mormonism in different ways. Ive always said Theres no right way to Exmo. Some people like to laugh  Im one of them. Im sorry if its not your thing. I have to do it. If I take everything about leaving the church seriously without turning some things into jokes it just hurts too damn bad. You should also realize that the language may be in part to the church leaving certain words out of our vocabularies for decades. When people first leave the church they have a tendency to overdo things that were once forbidden before falling back to somewhere in the middle. Swearing is part of that.Overall I just feel bad for you. This sub and this world outside of the LDS Church is full of wonderful people with unique experiences and things they can share. To your point it can also be a crass disrespectful disgusting place. However writing off a whole group of people based on some pretty kneejerk reactions is unfortunate. I bet if you had some real conversations with some of the people here you would be better for it. Even some of the people you probably detest right now. We can all learn from each other. But if youre unwilling to look past the surface or you think that you cant learn something from someone else youre unlikely to find the great things about people.If your words are truly heartfelt maybe were better off without you.

9472179,0,t3_5agxyn,While I appreciated your introspection these ideas cannot be solely attributed to being raised Mormon. The culture may have exacerbated it but these are all issues that nonMormon women face. Yes there are been some gains but women are still fighting these stereotypes and they are not truly equals on the social hierarchy. This has been established through a vast amount of academic gender research. Again not saying that men arent fighting stereotypes and some form of discrimination. This is studied as well. However males overall enjoy a greater status. This isnt opinion. This is fact. If you and I sent identical resumes to a potential employer and we only changed the name at the top you are most likely to get the job with your male name. The more feminine sounding the name the greater the penality. The more masculine the name the more the applicant is assumed to be logical and capable. Lets say I do get an interview? I will be judged by my physical attractiveness and fitness more than you will. Even wearing my hair down in that interview will lessen my chances on securing the job. Dont even get me started on what minorities face in this country particularly women of color. Even women are mostly unaware of how unequal it is for them in various aspects of their daily lives because we dont mandate gender education in grade school in the US. When I hear anyone say they are not sexist I cringe inside. Of course they are! We all aremales and females! We just dont realize it because most of us havent been taught to recognize it. Even at birth the socialization begins. A parent will let a baby boy cry longer than a female baby. A parent wont let a female baby crawl away as far. They will correct her more and tell her how pretty she is more. Little boys have the most witty strong role models. Girls are usually the subordinate character that is not leading other boys if shes even leading at all. More likely she is portrayed as the pretty and nice one. Teachers on average spend more time with their male students. Teachers expect more compliance from females than the males. These are overall averages in case theres someone out there thinking thats not true because they know an exception to these statements. And on and on it goes throughout our lifetimes. It is ubiquitous. These issues are not unique to Mormonism. Lets not even touch the pervasive sexism in most porn. Its commendable that youre thinking about these issues and I appreciate your candor. Leaving Mormonism opens the door to greater critical thinking on society since we no longer assume theres a proscribed lifestyle that God wants. The world is changing though not soon enough for some of us. Sigh. ,exmormon,d9gnfyl,13,t5_2r0gj

Is it fair to McMullin? No. Not really. Hes just a bog standard neocon who may or may not have more integrity than most politicians. In fact I think hes only incidentally mormon i.e. Hes a mormon running for president not a mormon chosen by the church to run for president. But its not really about him. Its about him as a symbol. Its about how the church and the membership respond to the idea of him running. And from my point of view among other things it brings up a distasteful possibility are we going to see a new era where the membership start nominating their own every election so that they have a mormon alternative? That is to say even though the church institution and the membership didnt nominate him are they going to like the idea of voting for a Mormon that they start having their own candidate? Unlikely but then again thats just the most extreme outcome of this whole strange political phenomenon in mormonism that is getting him votes in the morridor.

Sagan hits his groove about  of the way in though and the story really starts to develop.  Its well worth the read especially if you treat it as a philosophical thought experiment and not a science fiction novel.IMO Both Malone young Ellie and Foster adult Ellie did a superb job of capturing what Ellie was supposed to be.

9528316,0,t1_d9nb8bu,gt We eat we shit we socialize we procreate we explore we discoverSo this is another interesting thing. We have the needdrive to do these things because theyve been necessary for survival passing on genes. There were likely past humans that werent very social and when it came time to rely on each other their bonds werent as strong and they didnt survive thereby ending their genetic line. Socializing is genetically hardwired into humans because it gives our genes the best chances to be passed on. The same goes for the need to explore discover etc. So a question is what human attributes that currently define the human experience and were necessarily for humanitys development can we engineer away? And should we? Why would we? Why wouldnt we? What would humanity be like without these drives? We currently get joy from eating because that was a genetic advantage in the past. Again there were probably past humans though this probably happened before the human evolutionary branch who didnt really care about eating and didnt get a positive emotional response from eating. And they more likely died because they didnt eat enough when they had the chance. But do we still need that positive emotional response to food? Especially when resources abound? Its why people keep eating and become obese. But its also why we love pizza and ice cream. And Im not sure I could live in a utopia that doesnt have pizza and ice cream. ,exmormon,d9nke9j,2,t5_2r0gj

In effect its Truth would be a process of evolution making it a living Church.  Hence at any one time one would not necessarily find it to be absolutely true but if one followed its trajectory forward in time you would find it becomes nearer and nearer to absolute truth rather than decaying into error i.e. the Mormon conception of Catholicism or remaining in stasis the exMormon conception of current Mormonism dogmatism.,exmormon,d9ts1wd,1,t5_2r0gj

9582508,0,t3_5c5d9x,I am atheist. Youre not alone in your theism but this sub is skewed toward atheists because we dont have a church or IRL community or support group. We dont hold even the vocabulary that our friends and family have prayer faith scripture church. Its isolating which is why many come to online forums.As far as reasons why I think atheism is the rational position thats an enormous line of argumentation and study that led me to this. I spent a decade reading philosophy history biblical scholarship and studying the sciences. Then one day I admitted to myself that theres probably no God and the universe does not appear to be created by a benevolent allpowerful being. We make a lot of excuses for why the universe is hostile to life why people and animals suffer for no apparently moral reason why the ancient prophets got some things so obviously wrong but should be trusted in matters we cannot test and why we cling to a hope to live after we die but have no good reason to believe that.Heres a series of arguments if you have time and are interested but I also recommend reading Bart Ehrmans books on the New Testament which give a historical perspective on the narrative of Jesus. Understanding the historical Jesus vs the gospel writers narratives is one critical key to confidently leaving Christianity.Long argument to follow in multiple posts....copied from something I put together to get my mind straight on it a few years ago excuse the formattingEvidence  something which makes something else more probable than it otherwise wouldve been. Example  jars with jelly beans  has  red and  blue the other is  blue and  red. Now imagine you are handed a jelly bean from one of the jars but you dont know which it came from. If you are handed a red jelly bean thats evidence that it came from the first jar. Although its possible that it came from the second jar its more likely that it came from the first jar because there are more jelly beans in the first jar than in the second. Likewise if its a blue bean then that is evidence that it came from the second jar.Naturalism  the physical world explains why anything mental exists. If naturalism is true then there are no purely mental beings which can exist apart from a physical body so there is no God. Supernaturalism  the view that the mental world explains why anything in the physical world exists. If supernaturalism is true then there is no physical world that can exist apart from a mental creator.Theism is a type of supernaturalism. Its the belief that there is an allpowerful allknowing allgood personal mind called God. Christian theism is a type of theism that says God has revealed Himself decisively in Jesus Christ.When you weigh the evidence for Christian Theism against the evidence for Naturalism which way on balance does the evidence point?Naturalism is a simpler explanation than Christian theismNaturalism is a more accurate explanation than Christian theismLets look at . Naturalism and supernaturalism are symmetrical claims. Naturalism claims that the physical explains the mental while supernaturalism claims the mental explains the physical. Both claims are equally modest and equally coherent. Before examining the evidence both positions are equally likely to be true. Now compare naturalism and Christian theism. Theism says everything that naturalism says but adds on several additional claims such asThe nonphysical entity which explains the natural world is a personThat person created the world for a purposeThat person is allpowerful all knowing and allgood.Christian Theism adds on more claims to the claims of theism. Because Christian theism entails or implies supernaturalism it could be false even if supernaturalism is true it follows that prior to examining the evidence Christian theism is less likely to be true than supernaturalism. And so Christian theism is also less likely to be true than Naturalism. Lets turn then to my second basic contention. Naturalism is a more accurate explanation than Christian theism. Here Id like to present nine lines of evidence that are more probable on Naturalism than on Christian TheismNaturalism is the best explanation for the fact that physical matter existsThe existence of physical matter is consistent with Christian theism. God couldve created matter but God couldve chosen to create other minds without physical bodies such as angels and wouldve therefore not needed to create a physical universe to support such bodies. Or god couldve chosen to create nothing at all. In other words Gods existence doesnt entail physical matter. In contrast Naturalism implies that physical matter exists. In other words if Naturalism is true then physical matter must exist. Since Naturalism entails that physical matter exists whereas Theism does not it follows that physical matter is evidence favoring Naturalism over Theism.Naturalism is the best explanation for the fact that the so much of the universe is hostile to life.Discoveries in astronomy have revealed that vast majority of the universe is hostile to life. It contains vast amounts of empty space temperatures near absolute zero cosmic radiation and so forth. Given that life exists in this universe the fact that so much of the universe is hostile to life is more probable on Naturalism than on Theism.,exmormon,d9u8n12,1,t5_2r0gj

One of the first things that I did once I decided that it likely wasnt true was try a few coffee drinks. That was always one of the few teachings in the church that didnt make much sense to me as a TBM. Branching out and deciding what I actually believe for myself has been incredibly liberating!I havent told anyone that I know who is still TBM about my decision yet.

I spoke to a CA friend of mine last week and he told me that his preK twins are in full day preK. Completely paid for by the state. Of course the highest marginal income tax rate in CA is . compared to UT at .We need to increase education funding in UT. There are too many kids to educate relative to tax dollars earmarked for education. In my view UT tax policy should reflect that the state will educate a maximum amount of  kids per family and tax creditsdeductions reflect this. Anything beyond  kids and certain deductions and credits are phased out and possibly a per head education fee is assessed. So if you have  kids you will essentially be paying a perhead education fee on  of your schoolage children. All of this  goes into state education coffers. If you choose to have a ton of kids then you better be ready to pay for their public schooling. Just look at the funding challenges that the Jordan school district is having right now a high growth area with a ton of kids as well as some of the UT County districts.Thank you for being a teacher.

They dont compare well  a onetime thing for an ongoing commitment.  This kind of bargain mixes principles and practices and emotional and material things.Only you can say how important separating your name from the church is to you.  That you would consider foregoing that satisfaction to spare your wifes feelings shows her that you value her and is noble.  Trading that nobility for a material change in finances is hard to see as a good deal for you.She might see it as a devils bargain for her trading her good standing to save her eternal family.  Emotional leverage often pries apart couples and it is different than compromise.  Think about how you would like her to view you as a person.  Is holding a match to your membership records  and by extension in her mind your eternal attachment to her and your family  the kind of image you want in her mind?You are in the middle of compromises already and she should recognize that you are putting love for her and consideration of her feelings above something very important to you.

Is she showing you how valuable you are to her by her choices?  That is a question she should answer  and provide supporting details.I suppose you could think of it in terms of strategy  do you have a longterm plan for making you both happy in which this bargain you propose would play a role?  Or is this a shortterm trade to give her a chance to show she recognizes the sacrifices you make for her?I feel your frustration about this.

9791504,0,t1_dajtn1q,Yep. Some additional backgroundFirst practice investigators are just community volunteers. Theyre generally BYU students or staff and the most theyll get in compensation is some food. The MTC does not teach actual investigators with some extraordinarily narrow exceptions Ill mention below. A lot of RMs do it to keep current with some of the stranger languages.Second some of them are nonmembers. Sometimes its nonmember family of members or people that have odd language skills. In my language there were a few nonMormon investigators  but they were there for the lingo not for the theology.Practice sessions are videotaped and are ranked by MTC faculty or occasionally other missionaries. I got to spend a bonus week in the MTC dumb story pertaining to calendaring so I filled a lot of it doing reviews for the practice investigators.Now when will they work with actual investigators? When there is a language so rare that the only people they can find that speak it are MTC staffers or missionaries. Youll occasionally see this for very rare languages where there is nobody infield with the language skills  like Icelandic or Hebrew which were the two languages I can ever recall this occurring with.And the other time theyll work with actual investigators? Missionaries staffed the Free Book of Mormon and Free Bible tollfree lines so theyd be working with investigators to the extent that theyd take such calls discuss some religion with the person ordering then hand over the referral to the infield missionaries. ,exmormon,dak0kqx,3,t5_2r0gj
9793172,0,t1_dak7dn8,No idea.  The problem is in Norway a church gets government funds so the government  is on the churches to clean up their rolls.   The Catholic church has a two fold problem.   First it keeps crappy records.  Second it believes baptism is indelible it cant be cancelled you cant undo it by resigning even excommunication doesnt cancel it.   So even if Bjorn doesnt want to be a member he cant get off the church rolls.  Between that and the shitty records the church has to guess who is a member. So the church is getting more money than it should and it doesnt have much motivation to fix the problem.  This is probably going to go to the EU courts where Norway will probably loose despite being in the right because its a government trying to dictate to a religion how to count its members and EU courts uphold religious freedoms.,exmormon,dak7yjo,4,t5_2r0gj

9795667,0,t1_dakc9k5,The only Roman records that mention Jesus are Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews. Josephus mentions him twice.  One of the times is a very clear and clumsy forgery inserted by later scribes.  The other reference mentions James as the Brother of Jesus who is the Christ.  James and Jesus were very common names so they might refer to any James and Jesus.  The phrase who is the Christ may have been an addition by later scribes.  It is the only time Josephus uses the term Christ.  One characteristic of Josephus is that he was obsessive about defining terms he used.  However he never defines Christ.  We know Christian scribes changed the text of Josephus once so they could have changed it twice.There are some other things that  make Josephus questionable.  Josephus was not a contemporary observer of Jesus.  Josephus was born after the dates of the crucifiction.  Tha Antiquities of the Jews was written in about  AD.  Josephus was clearly not an eyewitness of Jesus.  Also we do not have any early and unaltered manuscripts of the Antiquities.  However we do have the works of some authors who wrote commentaries of the Antiquities and they do not mention the Jesus references at all.Some other Roman authors like Tacitus around  CE mention Christians.  But no one disputes that there were Christians by  AD.  In fact we can document the development of some wildly different sects of Christianity by that time. But records of Christians are not records of Christ.People raised Christian think the existence of Jesus is obvious.  But from an objective standpoint the actual evidence is very very weak.  We do know there were a lot of Mesianic preachers in the first part of the first century.  People had worked out dates from the prophesies in the Book of Daniel and they seemed to point to that time as the date for the Messiahs return.  There were a lot of people who claimed to be the Messiah or who like John the Baptist claimed to be prophets of the Messiah.  One of those preachers might have been the origin of the Jesus myths written in the Gospels.  But the Roman records other than Josephus give us no clue about the actual Jesus.  And four words of dubious origin make the issue far from obvious.,exmormon,dakj061,2,t5_2r0gj

9812932,0,t3_5fr6iv,This is only apocryphal but seems plausible When called as patriarch one is given examples of current blessings given in the stake as a way of familiarization with verbiage syntax and flow Read DampC  Make sure there is a declaration of lineage  Joseph Fielding Smith cautioned to be conservative with the blessingThe handbook directs patriarchs to refer to the Worldwide leadership training section regarding patriarchs. Training and supervision of the Patriarch is ultimately the responsibility of the SP.The Stake President should be able to detect any decrease in cognition and follow the guidance in the handbookgtIf a patriarch is incapacitated by age or illness as determined by the stake president or the patriarch the stake president writes a recommendation to  the Quorum of the Twelve that the patriarch be given nonfunctioning status. If the recommendation is approved the patriarchs name is not presented for a sustaining vote in the next stake conference when Church officers are sustained.

BONUS  It mostly makes me mad because I feel like I am being silenced and I am not allowed to say anything contrary to church teachings in social media Yes I realize I can and probably should just speak my  cents but that would not be good for family and marriage relations right now.  TBMs are allowed to spew whatever crap they want about the church and if I were to share the CES letter or any number of historical booksarticlesposts I fear that someone would turn me into my bishop and ultimately be excommunicated which once again wouldnt be good for familyMarriage relations at this point if I want to stay married.So I guess I find it unfair.,exmormon,dapm1mz,4,t5_2r0gj

I became a very harsh critic of anyone who wasnt living up to MY standards and I hated who I was because I knew all that judging was sinful. So I am incredibly happy to be out now and the thing that surprises me most is that there is a lot more empathy on this side of the rope even though the main point of Mormonism is supposed to be love. ,exmormon,dapo3fa,3,t5_2r0gj

The ONLY reason for business tax is to move tax money to the localities where those services are needed.Example a factory uses roads and policefire in a city state or country that is different then the end user. So a business property tax makes sense. Costs are raised and all end users help pay for the services used. If you then tax business profits you are now double dipping and raising costs for no reason I think a nonprofit property tax would be wise but leaving their income tax exempt.,exmormon,dapxeqa,3,t5_2r0gj

9843156,0,t1_daqcfnq,Agreed. We emphasized the importance of baptism with only a brief nod to the temple when in fact in Mormon theology it is essentially a throwaway ordinance for eight year olds. We would baptize people knowing full well that they had no grasp of the lifetime commitment they are theoretically making.Edit Upon further consideration I realize that this comment was a little contradictory. Id like to clarify. We would baptize people treating it as a pinnacle saving ordinance when in reality it is only the very first step in the long expensive difficult commitment that is required to be saved in Mormon theology. We knew this. All attempts to inform people what they were signing up for were cursory. We said nothing of the eternal principal of polygamy unless forced. We made no mention of our historic racism or our antagonism towards gay people. We were taught that AdamGod theory and blood atonement were fringe theories overblown by Antimormons if we were told about them at all and so we never made any effort to address them. There are so many other things that investigators and lay members are kept in the dark about but those are items that I personally knew about at the time and purposely withheld. In these ways I was complicit in the dishonesty that permeates the Mormon institution.,exmormon,daql47k,3,t5_2r0gj

He told his men to open the gates and hide.  When the approaching army saw the gates open and this leader who was famous for his tricks was alone and playing the flute the army ran away thinking he had some trap up his sleeves.    By chance do you know his name?Sadly  I learned the term from a Board game.   My father was an avid gamer and some of my best memories were playing games as a family in the cold winters.

9951341,0,t3_530q2p,I just stumbled upon a newer video of yours tonight here on reddit and Ive been going back through your overview to catch up.  Good stuff!  True and funny stuff awkward stuff and now this  Humanist stuff!  Thanks for this!  When I was young I once dated a Mormon.  We were both temporarily for several years living onlocation of a project we were both involved in.  I didnt know anything about Mormonism at the time.  I traveled to the west coast U.S. with my date on vacation to meet the family.  I talked in length with the older biological brother who was about to go on a mission in South America.  It seemed awful to me.  He seemed frightened underneath his act of convincing himself and me that this was a great thing.  I went to some gettogethers and met some of the community mostly young people.  I learned they call each other Brother and Sister.  We drove past a temple and I heard the reverence in their voices and the importance they assigned to the place Soandso and soandso were sealed in that temple.  We then traveled to Idaho to meet the estranged parent and stepparent who told us to Wave at Bishop on the porch across the street when we first arrived.  Its funny my date got into an argument with the step parent on the day we left and this person literally threw the Book of Mormon at my date!  Good times.  All of these people seemed so incredibly normal in every way.  Looking back and knowing what I now know about Mormonism and religions in general I find it sad that so many are born and bred into them not realizing the scam of it and the corruption and greed of their leaders.  I was born into Catholicism.  Luckily for me the Catholic hold in my experience was a loose one.  When I finally came to my senses all it took to leave the faith was to do one of those cartoon head shakes and to cancel the wake up for church alarm on Sundays.  With other religions its not so easy some people lose everything and everyone sometimes they lose their lives. Thank you for putting a human side to the young people indoctrinated into Mormonism.  They dont know any better.  If one ever comes to my door Ill step outside and have a chat with them and hopefully ask the right questions to plant seeds of doubt and activate their powers of critical thinking!  ,exmormon,db4oor1,1,t5_2r0gj

9982373,0,t1_db8lqec,Way too much to condense here and much of it anecdotal or related to me from friends who work and live there still. And still several other stories Ive been asked to not share publicly. A good example that typifies his tenure and general attitude One of his first meetings with the community and school he was asked in what ways he would help continue the multicultural legacy of Laie and BYUH. His response was I dont believe in culture. He had complete disregard for consulting with local elders in the community Kpuna about the schools plans to expand or about his role in general. School presidents and ecclesiastical leaders in Laie are informally considered chiefly in title and his predecessor was a very well respected one at that Dr. Eric Shumway who made sure these honored and respected members of the community knew what was going on and had a chance to voice input. With many friends still there from all parts of the church spectrum TBM to NOMs to EXMO and in all capacities community members but with jobs in Honolulu students faculty leadership no one that I know has good things to say about his time as president. Many of them described it as a depressing oppressive time to be at the school and to live in Laie with a strong Orwellian vibe in church at work at school at play?!. From the Churchs POV he was great! He balanced the books he fired local people and brought in replacements from the mainland he grew the campus size and capacity waaay beyond what the rural area of the north shore can even support and he grew the business and entrepreneurship program while cutting funding to liberal arts and fine arts etc. etc. ,exmormon,db8qccs,8,t5_2r0gj

9990138,0,t3_5ikzll,I think you have a lot of good insight in to your Mother. But can I ask what exactly about her behavior constitutes narcissism? I think your wife was dead right. Your Mom is full of ht. But that is not the same as narcissism at least to my mind.Maybe I am dead wrong here and someone better informed about such things can correct me. But I know many people just like your mother who usegtthe uholyspook to justify her irresponsibility and bad decisions.Now maybe she not only uses the Holy Ghost to justify but she vaunts herself as some superrighteous person. Maybe she brags. Maybe she puts down other people. Maybe she needs to be the center of attention. Maybe she is extremely selfish. All of these would again in my uneducated opinion be good examples of narcissism. But I didnt exactly get that from your story.In my own life I have many TBM family members who constantly justify their bad decisions with the HG. It drives me bananas. But they are humble people. In fact their justification is often supported by church leaders and they simply go along with that assessment. Oh hubby didnt get that new job? Well the Bishop said it must be because we need to stay here for some purpose so it isnt because he never finished his education. You see my point. These are decent humble people who are almost trained to justify bad decisions with the HG. But I wouldnt ever call them narcissists.You did mentiongtAll of her completely unobtainable plans are self centered and grandiose. Every time she mentions someone it is within the context of how they can benefit her.That certainly leans more narcissist. But it might also just be someone trying to kep their chin up and maintain some degree of selfesteem.Anyway maybe your story just didnt offer that type of detail.

Just because you yearn for something doesnt mean it is ultimately worth yearning for or that your yearning must be evidence of some deeper meaning or that there is an definitive solution to what you want. Ever.I think there is value in the process of evaluating why you want it to be true. And there is value in contextualizing your response against the billions of people who have lived on this earth while worshiping all kinds of gods that would seem cartoon characters to you.Even if you could find a belief in an afterlife all you are doing is procrastinating your real question. Is that more compelling to you? Well Ill find out the FULL story in the next life. Then its just turtles all the way down.For example the Mormon church claims to know the answer to what happens after this life...but push the to dig deeper and address what happens after that or why that would be fulfilling and eventually the response is inevitably well we dont know that. Why is that any more acceptable an answer than me just saying the same thing right now instead of just abstracting it one or two layers and eventually declaring the same thing?And beyond that the existence of a god could potentially be deeply disturbing.

Imagine how a fairly new bishop would feel if he had just been elevated and anointed in the past few years when the exodus accelerated   the church teaches men that if theyre called to be bishop it comes directly from God. You cant blame a person for wanting to believe that and to hope they will do a good job whatever the heck that might mean in the church.  However for bishops in recent years there are a ton of departures that have nothing to do with how well theyve performed their office. It would be normal for them to feel stressed overwhelmed and to blame themselves or feel like failures.

It is fine if you want to solidify your choice yourself by putting it down but dont send it to others.Most importantly your behavior validates the position of the LDS movement as the moderator of all relationships.  You have a direct relationship with your family that is not defined by Mormonism.  Dont use your letter and Mormonism to divide your family.I say it will divide your family because you make it an issue of relationship by involving them in your choice by way of explanation when none is necessary.  Your family members will not receive your letter and read it dispassionately.  They will not consider its points topics for informed conversation and exploration.  You are demanding their attention by sending this letter.  This demand is more about you and your emotionalpsychological needs then information for them.  Introducing this drama into the relationship will not result in enhanced positive relationships.  As I have said to others dont send the letter.  Your an adult and of course free to not believe.

10164684,0,t3_5ld1pi,so what gets me is the doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith bullshit. In my experience Mormons treat doubt like a character flaw more so than other religions not that Im claiming any vast knowledge of all religions or anything. Doubt is a great tool and necessary for functioning in the everyday world to paraphrase something a poster on one of the ExMormon forums I frequent said doubt is what keeps you from getting swindled. Doubt helps us tell fact from fiction keeps us from humiliating ourselves and leads us to the truth. Doubt keeps us from just blindly believing things just because this person or that said it. I would submit that if your belief does not survive your doubt then it wasnt the truth to begin with. The truth will survive the questioning engendered by doubt and anything that doesnt can and should be cast aside.,exmormon,dbw81kx,1,t5_2r0gj

Weve long suspected they have been reducing stake congregation requirements to feign stake growth and this proves it.    Overall this report basically says that growth is dead everywhere in the world except Utah Idaho and West Africa which is a net suck on tithing revenue and this with a massive surge in missionaries that is already rapidly disapating.  California is flat out collapsing.  Much of Utahs growth is California members packing it in for the mothership. This is an omminous sign for TSCC considering they are also losing  percent of their youth.

The burning just indicates how empathetic person you are which is not all that bad you know. The church as many other religious movements use this human trait to their advantage and redefine it as the spirit. None. They find out that theyve been conned. This is part of the cult milieu control. Making people wear certain clothing or doing stuff tends to shift their beliefs to support those actions. So effectively the more stuff the missionaries ask you and you agree to do the more you end up believing it. Part of the milieu control as well. Absolutely not. LDS church is a cult a big one. They lure you in with their love bombing and once they get you hooked they start to tighten the screws... Joseph Smith was a copycat he was copying stuff everywhere. The LDS church falls within the syncretist cult description combinin old religions magic and masonic influences in one package. Because at the heart of it all is business.

The word lies sets up defense mechanisms but paradox does not.  Paradox is when you claim to support two opposite positions e.g. peace and violence but in actuality each individual only supports one position.  Part of the appeal of Christianity in general and Mormonism in specific is that both embrace a large number of paradoxes  ideas that cannot truly exist in unity when considered in reality.  Therefore each individual thinks that their specific view of Mormonism means whatever their biases already embrace when in reality Christianity and Mormonism are tribal identities where multiple paradoxes exist and therefore can be twisted and turned to represent a multitude of viewpoints.,exmormon,dc347jl,5,t5_2r0gj

I didnt even make it through the MTC and the next several years I was basically adrift not knowing how to get help.  Do. Not. Go. There is no real support for you if you come back early theres a very real chance you will. You will be a shadow in the chapel and nobody will know what to do with you. You may need your parents to run a screen for you but you need to get some medical treatment and counseling for your anxiety and OCD. If you need to say I feel like I need to do a year of school first then do it. I cannot stress enough how much you need to get treatment for the OCD and anxiety. This is what I learned the hard way nobody in the church will look at your case and say wow this kid needs some treatment. Hes not able to go. Nobody. All the pressure us to go and get it sorted out later. The decision to put your health and peace of mind first has to be yours and hopefully your parents back you up. Stay strong.

10417027,0,t1_dcno9e8,I was converted at . My parents were inactive pot heads and when a missionary showed up I was in love with the idea of everything they want you to know. I dreamed of going to the temple. We are starting going together and I felt so much love. I was from a tiny branch of around  and most of them were related to me. Once I became and adult and moved I felt so constantly judged at my new ward. I stopped going every Sunday but still prayed and read the scriptures. Fast forward a couple years Im married to a non LDS and have a daughter. But I felt incomplete not having my endowments not being sealed. I started to look up something one day on endowments and some how came to a video of one. I felt incredibly uncomfortable yet incredibly intrigued Ive wanted to go to one my whole life. Ive asked many questions about them for a wait and see answer. So I said screw it and pressed play. I literally threw up watching it. I stayed up all night and was studying how cult like they are.. I felt so betrayed. I brought it up to an exmormon friend of mine and he told me to take it slowly and look at Joseph Smiths history and the CES letters. It took over my whole life for awhile. Now I mostly just read stories on Reddit and Ive been planning on how I should resign. ,exmormon,dcou6m9,1,t5_2r0gj

10442101,0,t3_5pfcu1,So the rest of the story....for a number of years I was one of those people that quietly sits in Priesthood and Sunday school thinking that the Plan of Salvation doesnt really make any sense if you think about it that  years is a really long time to leave everyone swinging in the wind until there is a sudden need for a restoration and that the stories in the bible about the Flood Jonah Moses etc...have no real basis in reality.  I never spoke up publicly but I guess you could say I was no longer buying into everything the church was pushing.  Then one day at an airport magazine stand I saw this article on the financial side of TSCC and I decided I needed to learn a bit more about my religion. That sent me down the rabbit hole and I learned of the polyandry the BoA issues the coercion and grooming of underage girls by JS etc.  Within a few weeks I came to the conclusion that the TSCC was grossly deceitful and the whole thing was BS. I still kept attending to keep my wife company during Sacrament but I resigned from my calling. I stopped paying tithing. I no longer felt subject to TSCC control.  A few months later tithing settlement rolls around and I get a calls and emails from the Exec. Secretary to come in for tithing settlement.  I ignore them until one day I just happened to be in the church hallway after Sacrament and he corners me and says the Bishop wants to meet with my right then for Tithing Settlement. I tell him I will never pay tithing again so I didnt see the point. He appears frustrated and almost pleads with me to tell that to the Bishop so he doesnt have to.  I say fine Ill go talk to him right now. I sit down and tell him that I have not recently nor will I pay tithing in the future. I added that I do not support the Church I do not believe Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the church is dishonest regarding its history. I go over some of the historical issues of which is he wholly unaware.  At that point I take out my temple recommend rip it up in front of him and place the pieces on the desk and walk out.That is the last time I heard from the Bishop.  The Stake President ask me to come visit with him a few months later which I obliged to make sure he was under no illusions regarding my opinion on the church.  He was slightly more knowledgeable about the issues I mentioned but brushed them all under the rug with the blanket statement that we dont have all the answers right now.  He also told me that I should not mention any of these concerns to any of my children so as not to hurt the testimony.  As you may imagine my voice quickly escalated at that suggestion.  While I wont say it was an outright yelling match I would call it a very energetic conversation.  After about two hours of me telling him everything about the church which I felt was dishonest disreputable and harmful. I bid him goodbye and that is the last I have hear or seen of him.  Amazingly enough for about three years the only outreach I got from the ward was a yearly call from the Executive Secretary asking me to come in for Tithing Settlement.  I had to repeat that in no uncertain terms would I attend Tithing Settlement again as I was pretty sure I got the message across the last time.  I think they finally got the idea as I did not get the call this year.  It also may be due to the fact that the Bishop changed and is now a friend who has never asked me a single thing about the church.My wife kept going alone for about  months longer than I did.  The break was not as immediate for her as it was for me and her reasons are slightly different but no less valid.  Funny enough when I am out of town for work she sometimes gets visits from sisters who are somehow under the impression that I have forbid her from coming to church and offer to take her to the Bishop for counseling while I am away.  When that has happened they get a pretty big earful from her to set them straight.  Unfortunately my kids from a previous marriage are still in the church.  Due to my rebellion I have missed ordinations weddings and all the other life events that the church hijacks as its own.  But when I feel like i am missing out I just remind myself that in no way shape or form do I want to ever witness my children undergoing the cultish temple rituals.  My goal is to simply present to them a healthy and better way and let them decide in their own time if it is also right for them as it is for me.  ,exmormon,dcroww3,9,t5_2r0gj

I put those things on my shelf.

I would have thought that shed have been exposed to this kind of nuance and uncertainty just though normal church lessons and discussions.

I have worked in Culver City next to a soundstage and seen higher security measures around expensive sets etc.. Im not sure how much of the barbed wire existed before the protests started in  or so.

Most of the pictures of Int base were taken in the Angry Gay Pope era or later and his images are from .

10518973,0,t3_5qld1t,I took my  year old niece to church one Sunday. She was almost ready to be potty trained and was constantly fascinated with anything poo wee burp or fart related. The chapel was quiet while the sacrament was being passed around. Apparently my niece had just let off one of those silent yet deadly farts. As per usual she tells me in a small voice  did a fart. Not wanting to break the silence of the room I just nodded in acknowledgement. This nonvocalised response didnt sit well with her so she  tells me how she did a fart? in a louder voice making it into a  question this time in hopes for a verbal acknowledgementrecognition from me of her accomplishment as a  year old farter. Now people in our pew and the ones Infront of and behind us sawheard and started chuckling thinking  year old was asking if I had done the silent yet deadly fart. Mortified I reply in hushed rushed tones yes yes while shushing her hoping to give her the acknowledgement she needs from me so she can go back to playing with her doll. Lo and behold she was totally offended by how I brushed her off  instead of giving her my usual wow you did a stinky fart like daddy! response.  So now she climbs up on the pew stands up grabs my face with her little chubby hands brings her face almost nose to nose with mine and yells DID A FART?!?!? demanding a proper acknowledgement and response from me.... I had no recourse but to say in an almost normal voice Yes you did as I felt the entire congregations eyes on me with many thinking I instead of my niece had farted and she was just wanting me to own up to it. Finally satisfied  she notices she has the congregations attention. Still standing on the pew she turns to the congregation and proclaims Stinky one! then turns to look at me with raised eyebrows waiting for my acknowledgement of the amazing stinkiness of her fart. Mortified but wanting to end this fartgate as quickly as possible I reply to her knowing everyone in the room is watching us Yes very stinky one. Beaming she nods to herself climbs down from the pew picks up her doll and crawls under the pew and quietly goes on playing with it as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. This is how a fart interrupted the most sacred part of the sacrament meeting one Sunday more than a decade ago. ,exmormon,dd0ftqk,47,t5_2r0gj

Having questions about the church has resulted in your separation from Jesus. Or put another way if you question LDS Inc. you are experiencing separation from the Son of God. They are there to fix the disease that gave you nausea or vomiting. They are there to fix the problem that took you away from the church or Jesus. They use loaded language to suggest THEY are the cure to the same disease of having questions.  If you are away from Jesus its because of your questions doubts or concerns ABOUT the church and THEY are the fix. So I stand by my words. They do claim being away from the church is the same as being away from Jesus. And silly you if that happened just bring the concerns and they will fix it and all will be with with you and Jesus again.,exmormon,dd0tohw,1,t5_2r0gj

10524835,0,t3_5qn7kl,Page She finally consented to go. When we were alone he wanted to buy some wine. I did not know what to say so I thought a minute and said yes. As he went out the front hall to buy some wine I went the back way out into the pouring rain and ran as hard as I could. I finally came to a blacksmith shop where I inquired my way and how far it was to Florence. They told me to keep right on the way I was going for a few miles and I would get there all right. I went on a short distance when I caught up with two men with covered wagons and ox teams. They offered me a ride and asked me where I was going. I told them in my broken language my circumstances and where I wanted to go. They told me they were there to meet the emigrants and help them to Utah. I got up into the wagon but had not gone far when I looked out and saw a man coming on foot as hard as he could run calling to the bretheren to stop. I knew him and asked the brethren to help me and not let them take me back again. They assured me they would and for me not to be afraid. They had quite a time with the man but succeeded in keeping me out of his clutches and I came on in safety. I reached Florence and went to Elder Wm. Cluff of Provo who I knew would see to my welfare. He was at the church store. He sent me to live with a family named Thompson one of his acquaintenances until the church teams was to leave. After staying there two days I was walking along the street when a man spoke to me as he could see I was an emigrant and asked me to go with him and his wife across the plains to take care of her as she was in a delicate condition and told me to speak to Elder Cluff about it which I did. Elder Cluff said it would be alright so gave me a feather bed bolster and a pair of blankets. I went with Cederstrom and wife leaving Florence July   for our long journey to Utah. Arrived at Salt Lake City September  .After we had traveled about one week Cederstrom put me to driving the oxen. He had two yoke of oxen and one yoke of cows. I had nothing on my head a low neck dress with short sleeves and my shoes were almost gone to walk across the plains in the hot sun. He was a lazy man but good hearted and good enough to have me drive for three weeks through streams and all kinds of roads and gather fuel as I drove along to cook our meals until Captain Peter Nebeker told him that if he did not get out of his wagon and drive his own team he would expell him from the company. For he would not have his Company disgraced by having him sit in his wagon and have a young girl drive his team. So Cederstrom drove his own team but I had to gather fuel buffalo chips and get the water just the same. The only communications we had of other companies that were ahead of us was on buffalo skulls on which they had written and left by the roadside. We read on one of a stampede of the cattle dated July   where  were killed and  wounded. A few days later we came across a woman and  or  children whose husband had died after having been wounded in the stampede and was unable to go on. She had buried him alone by the roadside and was waiting for the next company to come along. She was a Danish lady and told me of some that were in the company that I knew. I described my lover and asked if he was there. She told me one young man got killed that answered his description. From then I was almost beside myself with grief believing him dead. I had my duties to attend to so next day as I had been gather fuel I had my lap full of chips and went up to the back of the wagon to put them in and fell unconscious on the ground. The wagons drove on and left me lying there. How long I lay there I do not know. Nor I knew nothing for three days. When I became conscious again I found myself in another mans wagon. He was Brother Elias Edwards from Goshen Utah. I was so weak I stayed in his wagon for a few days. He did all that he could for me and gave me the best he had to eat and nursed me back to health again. From that time on he payed me marked attention and helped me every way he could. When I was able to walk again I went back to Cederstroms wagon again and stayed with them until we reached Salt Lake city. During our journey my clothes were all in rags my feet were blistered to the ankles my hair had fallen out from the effects of walking all the way bareheaded in the sun and my sickness. I took my bolster and emptied the feathers out and made me a dress sack out of the ticking. This with what remained of my dress constituted my wearing apparel or costume. We were now nearing Salt Lake City and I was feeling bad because I looked so bad that I prayed to the Lord to open the way for me to get something to wear. I knew not how it would come but I trusted in the Lord and had full confidence in him and knew it would be given me. When we arrived at Ft. Bridger where the Johnson army had been some time previous I went out by myself at noon in the sagebrush where no one could see me. I stopped and right in front of me lay a five dollar green back. I picked it up it was folded together  times. I know the Lord led me to that place in answer to my prayer. ,exmormon,dd13roo,3,t5_2r0gj

By creating this site I hope to discourage researchers from using temple exposs produced by individuals and organizations hostile to Mormonism.gt what exactly goes on in the templeUnfortunately you are pressured into going indirectly by friends and family but its still pressure and once you finally get there they tell you that you will be making solemn covenants and if you want to leave you can.  But you dont know what these covenants are exactly so it would be weird to leave beforehand with everyone watching.  When they tell you what the covenants are the ceremony is going full blast.  And at that time you are not asked whether you want to do those things you are instructed to do them verbiage is in the command form.I think it is an unethical way of getting you to promise yourselves your time talents and everything with which the Lord has blessed you or with which he may bless you to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints.

10566959,0,t3_5ra927,Heres the millennial math if anyone was interested in thinking a thousand years is needed to get it done.  This is from a post I made a couple of months agoPeople are continuously reaching adulthood and beginning families all at different times and  people are leaving the child bearing population at different times.  Sounds complicated to compute but fortunately there is an easy equation for that PtIertLets start with two assumptions.  . All the people that have ever lived is  billion. . The Millenium starts with  million Mormons. We could just as well use  million it only changes the result by just a few years.  I modeled millennial Mormon population growth on births only I didnt count conversion during the millennium although most Mormons assume that shortly after the millennium begins the rest of the surviving world will convert.Using PtIe.t  where I is  million Mormons e is magic no its math  and t is the progression of time into the millennium and . is the r for Mormons reaching maturity and then having four children per couple by around age  and then leaving the child bearing population.  I limited endowments by each member to just one endowments per week. How long does it take to do the work for  billion dead people?   They will be done  in July of the year .  Leaving  years to goof off.  There is a catch it requires temples. The church would need  to start the millennium with  mid sized four room temples which it mostly has  and it would need  temples  years later dedicating a new one every two to three weeks to keep up with the expanding population.  That is a pretty aggressive building rate.  But the church would have to do it because if people in the perfect millennial world want to go once a week that is what is required.Lets limit each Mormon to just one endowment a month.  How long does it take?  The answer is  years.    To have enough temples for each Mormon to attend just once a month TSCC would have to begin the millennium with  mid size four room temples and have  temples  years later.   Its only one hundred fewer temples but the build rate is a little more manageable.We can run the model lots of different ways we can modify r so each couple has four children by age   we can start the millennium with I  one million Mormons.  We can limit each member to just six endowments per year and it doesnt make a lot of difference.  All the work still gets done in the first couple of hundred years and the number of temples needed is going to land at around .So what the fuck is a whole millennium for?,exmormon,dd5vudo,6,t5_2r0gj

When I revisited some of the things I remembered the film claiming I realized it was more truthy than true.  It was a reasonable accurate portrayal of what Mormons had believed or said at some point but it was not an accurate portrayal of what Mormons actually believed.

10582468,0,t3_5rdyr3,Some of the shenanigans that stood out to me Bishop Tuttles contact that claimed to have notes from a trial of J.S. and published it yet never disclosed the evidence. But the gold plates dont need to be disclosed to stake your whole life on it. When Oliver Cowdery said there was a trial it became indisputable. Other individuals claims made nothing indisputable.ish Question the sources that have something against J.S. but accept those with a vested interest in perpetuating the claims of J.S. People do lie...the irony of this statement. WHAM! Nice one Mr. Palmer! You cant build a point off of several falsehoods. Irony anyone?ish I dont know what hes seeing in the stone translation into mormonspeak Its not essential to my salvation. Basically Ill cherry pick what I want that I think matters in supporting my current paradigm and isnt potentially harmful to my testimony. Here is tribalism and indoctrination at its finest TBM essentially disqualifies anyone who says anything contrary to what J.S. said if they were antagonistic toward him or said something disparaging after leaving the church. I wonder what hed think about Leah Remini? I bet hed drool over her testimony against scientology the same way members drool over reports from people who convert from any other faith regarding the faith they left behind. It isnt like an iPod you can just turn it on speaking of the translation of the plates with the seer stone in a hat and the necessity of faith...sorry Dieter. Not an apple product. Your fault convert for not ever hearing about the seer stone. Who is supposed to teach you? WTF kind of response is this? One can learn about it on their own but when the missionaries and gospel principles teachers tell you he translated with a Urim and Thummim shouldnt they offer that he actually more often than not didnt use them?

However this comment seems to be the most relevant to what I have to say...You have a choice here.  Are you just a standin for the church?  The physical embodiment of Christ a human to marry so that your wife can make it to the CK?  Or are you a human that she loves has a real connection with and enjoys being around?If you feel your position in your marriage is just the human half that gives her the key to the CK divorcing her will just open up a vacancy that she can fill with any other priesthood holder to get there.  If you are a person that she loves and enjoys spending time with and doing things with you certainly should fight to remind her of that.  The SCC is for sure an every day church and it reminds families EVERY SINGLE DAY that the church is there for them.So take back FHE.  Instead of focusing on whatever lesson it is the church recommends take your family and do something fun.  The movies or hiking or bowling...Something that doesnt automatically start and end with prayer although if your wife insists it can be done on the way there or at home before leaving.  Get involved with the boy scouts again if you havent been and help out with the other kids stuff.  It is absolutely possible she hasnt answered because she doesnt really know.  Give her time to figure it out and give yourself time to figure things out.  There is a lot to be said about being the pariah at church  at some point she will either realize she loves YOU and all the nasty comments from her RS be damned or she will just embrace this as more of her trials to make it to the CK...TLDR what you really need to know is are you just a pawn to get her to the CK or does she love you and accept you even without the priesthood and the church to bind the two of you together...?,exmormon,dd8pf91,3,t5_2r0gj

They would teach each other useful skills to help with employment in addition to homemaking skills.When my mom was on her mission in Europe early s zone leaders district leaders and APs were often women.  She and her companion and the other two sister missionaries organized community outreach programs and programs for children which they held at the church.  They never had to ask permission to do things like this.  They had their own authority as missionaries.There was a Relief Society building in Ogden before it was torn down when they remodeled the temple.  The women had raised their own money and built their very own building where they had their own activities and community programs all without male authority or supervision.  During WWII they used it as a daycare for children of women who went back to work.

I hope she is able to accept your happiness and let go of the dogmatic doom that the church teaches regarding families that have different beliefs. much as I wish the same for me and my parents In reading the way you explained the doctrine regarding eternal separation of families I see more how LDS and Scientology both destroy families. It was when I was pregnant with my nevermo husbands child following divorcing my temple recommend holding sex offender of  years that I began to see temple covenants as horribly damaging and not something I could be a part of. First my parents mourned the loss of me eternally bc I was no longer temple worthy and secondly I had to sort out the teachings I was raised with that the child I was about to have would only be mine for this life simply because her father was not a member of the LDS Church.

10778695,0,t3_5u2ib1,I was in the same position as your  year old son. I was around  or  at the time my older sister who is  years older sexually experimented on me. She isnt gay she ended up marrying a man and only dated men. Whereas during my adolescence and young adulthood I also only dated guys I also felt an attraction towards girls albeit few. Unfortunately though I repressed this abuse until about sophomore year in high school around the time my mother died. When i finally remembered I broke. I never shared it with my sister or parents or other siblings. I divulged the abuse to my twin sister after we were both married and living in Rexburg  years later. It took another  years after my divorce and unofficial exit from the church to go to my older sister and tell her what she did had caused me years of pain and confusion. She had no memory of the abuse. None. At the time I think she was shocked and didnt say much. A little while later she called me crying saying that despite not being able to recall the abuse it doesnt excuse her actions and she takes full responsibility for it and how sorry she was. That was  and a half years ago. I dont think I resent her for it anymore perhaps I resent my father more than anything. It still causes a great deal of pain my emotions are intensely raw and draining even typing this out. Maybe your son is gay maybe he isnt. Either way you need to protect them both. The church will not help and perpetuates the homophobic stigma victim shaming and lack of responsibility for abuse that will result in neither of your children processing this in a healthy way and thus possibly causing lifelong trauma and resentment within your family. The worst thing you can do is not do anything. Its perhaps the reason I harbor such bitterness towards my own dad. Therapy love and support.

10851911,0,t3_5uvl6o,Thanks everyone for the comments and kind words. As of now I have dropped my classes at byui this semester to figure things out. Ive gotten my husband to research some and Ive insisted that he read the ces letter. I am one year into my degree at byui. I could get an associates degree with  more classes but I think Im gonna transfer out anyway. I will figure it out but theres no way Im going to be able to interact with these people and not get kicked out of byui anyway. I need a bishop interview every fall semester so I only would be able to go one semester more without getting kicked out for not believing the gospel drinking coffee and tea and smoking pot. I really hope my husband breaks away but I already told him that there is no way Im letting my kids go back. He thinks that its going to help them to get friends and have a foundational belief but they can do that literally anywhere else that isnt built on lies. I finished the ces letter last night after not being able to get away from it all day. I was constantly reading it when I found it. I got like  hours of sleep. I cant be associated with this place anymore and Im not going to let my children find out what I found out after realizing they wasted so much time and money on lies. Thats why I dont want my children to go. Honestly if my husband doesnt believe the obvious facts I dont see us staying together. The only reason I married him is so we could have sex anyway. The main reason I joined the church is because he said that he wouldnt stay with me long term if we werent the same religion and a lot of my negative feelings are directed at him because I feel he almost pressured me even though he wanted it to be my own decision. Im done. Im probably just going to stop talking to my friends at church because they arent real friends anyway. Theyre just people who keep you in line. Im done. I cant even anymore.

10894680,0,t3_5vjlf8,I disagree.Hitler can be baptized later despite orchestrating the deaths of more than six million people.Kids cant be baptized at yearsold because they have gay parents.Despite how this can be explained with a deeper look and internal LDS logic this is an obvious mess. A horror show. Despite their being LDS logic to this the fact that it exists and needs to be explained is really weird. Really fucking WEIRD.Some inside may or may not get that but others may say My true church sure acts like a weird cult sometimes.Those kinds of thoughts when the more important things come down can make a persuasive different in peoples minds. The very concept of a breaking shelf suggests there are a lot of items on that shelf. Hitlers temple work might be just such an item. Especially crazy is when Jewish leaders have asked repeatedly that Mormons stop baptizing deceased Jews and the LDS church promised it would and then they were baptizing more deceased jews. Plus the master of weedsmoking Rastafarian Bob Marley and a bunch of chiefs of native tribes. Meanwhile from the outside when I see it its really fucking weird and I am going to remark on it.

It sends a message of distrust and othering and puts them in more danger from any transphobes that see them using a mens restroom while looking like a woman or vice versa.

I found that Living the Secular Life by Phil Zuckerman has a lot of valuable perspectives.My own view yes it can be daunting to look at that big cold universe and realizing that were a blip and that will soon be gone. My solution love the life you have and try to enjoy it its temporary and should not be wasted. Youre amazingly lucky to experience it. Treat your friends and family well because theres no second chances in the afterlife. What you do right now is what counts. Edit one quick exception if your friends and family are toxic dont worry about treating them well so much as finding friends and family who arent toxic.,exmormon,de66gdm,2,t5_2r0gj

Not that your conclusions are wrong but that it shows what is at risk when one partner in a marriage begins down the rabbit hole that is one of many possible rabbit holes that show the fraud. The apologetic nature of the video comes with a foregone conclusion that the couple will work out their differences subject to arriving at a more nuanced state of belief. The risks are presented up front the happy home the child everything invested so far can be gone in a heartbeat. Its all contingent on following the mormon life template. That part I feel is especially accurate and is one of the things I use often. The video makes the case that there should be no secrets in a marriage.

In their stead DavidWhitmer maintained the Prophet used anovalshaped chocolatecolored seer stone slightlylarger than an egg. Thus everything we have in theBook of Mormon according to Mr. Whitmer wastranslated by placing the chocolatecolored stonein a hat into which Joseph would bury his head soas to close out the light. While doing so he couldsee an oblong piece of parchment on which thehieroglyphics would appear and below the ancientwriting the translation would be given in English.Joseph would then read this to Oliver Cowdery whoin turn would write it. If he did so correctly thecharacters and the interpretation would disappearand be replaced by other characters with theirinterpretation Cook David Whitmer Interviews .Such an explanation is in our judgment simplyfiction created for the purpose of demeaningJoseph Smith and to undermine the validity of therevelations he received after translating the Book ofMormon.So Joseph says F you God for taking my translating stones for being unworthy.

11002731,0,t1_dedq9w2,Sorry for the delayed response. Im enjoying our convo..gt so that as they assume they will have an opportunity to convince you or at a minimum try to do so.I would invite them to do so. Offer to investigate the beliefespecially how they came to the belief. Liken it to long division. They have their answer. They can bare testimony of the truthfulness of their answer but what you want is to have them show you how they came to the answer stepbystep. Investigate it together. gt If I might be wrong wouldnt the same logic and reasoning you just applied suggest that you also can not be confidant you are right either.If I had someone say this I would say Exactly! Im not saying that my conclusions are right.I think we need to do as David Hume advised and proportion our beliefs or the confidence with which we hold the beliefs to the evidence.For Mormons it seems that evidence for them is largely faith and argument from authority. Challenge their epistemology not their conclusions. gt Well if your logic would lead to the conclusion that EVERYONE is wrong then it isnt very useful logic since SOMEONE must be right.I would respond Couldnt it be the case that no one is right?Imagine you and  other people walk into a room with a large box on a table. Each person says what they think is in the box. Each person is confident they know. If you MIL says it is hair brush and she knows she could be right! If you feel she is predicting that there is a UPS truck in the box and you recognize that the box is far to small for something so big propose that you both investigate how she came to the belief. It may be that she simply does not care about evidence or reason and simply cares that she takes it on authority that there is a UPS truck in there but there is a chance even if only a small one that you could create a little mental space for doubt. I should also say that inlaws are probably not the best people to perform street epsitemology on but the example still works. As we see in the example whether there are  people guessing what is in the box or  billion we still dont know what is in the box. It could be nothing it could be a small glass figurine of a onelegged Kim Jung Ill eating ice cream with Tigger. The box from my example is even more abstract in reallife. Reality could be anything! To claim to know what this reality is is far less likely to be true than our box example. In short No. It is not the case that SOMEONE has to be right. We could all be wrong. And I would argue that NONE of us are right......What I mean by that is Reality is what it is. Each of us creates our own mental models of reality. Hopefully our model corresponds with reality accurately. But my model of reality is undoubtedly flawed as is yours. We are all inevitably wrong about some things. I think many people TBM and otherwise mistake our model for reality. It is a case of mistaking the map for the destination or terrain. So in conversations with people I start from that point. Reality is what it is and my beliefs my model is independent from it. I simply try my very best to investigate my starting assumptions my biases blind spots prejudices etc. and realize that the model I have is not reality. In that realization I am more able to revise my model. I simply follow the evidence and Im always willing to revise my beliefs. Lastly Ive adopted a FALSE | NULL | TRUE approach. Many people use a scale where evidence tips it one way or the other the problem with that I see is our biases place a finger on the scale and we have no way of factoring in what we dont know. With the false|null|true model when investigating a proposition I try to move it into the null. Depending on the strength of the evidence I will tentatively accept move to true or reject move to false the proposition and proportion the belief or my confidence in it to the strength of the evidence. And Im always willing to revise the position based on new evidence or a reexamination of the evidence I already have. Tell me what your thoughts are. I have recently made progress with a TBM using this method.  of our conversation has not been about mormonism but through investigating his method of understanding reality he is much less confident in his beliefs than he was a few months ago.Sorry for the novel!!,exmormon,def4ltc,1,t5_2r0gj

They really appreciated the honesty.There was a comment in here about reading stories to your kids.  This is helpful because stories show the grey areas in life decisions and character growth.  If you really dont know where to start google Newberry Medal books for kids or other awards.  Classics and modern books alike.  Without the church you will find you have more time and energy.  Instead of allowing a church to teach your children morals take matters into your own hands.  We had great relationships with our kids before we left the church and I have been amazed at how much better they have gotten as we left.Also I commented about activities.  Do this.  Get your kids involved in different social circles.  Meet new people.  Talk to other parents.  Take the first leap and invite other people over.  This will take some time but just be aware of opportunities as they arise.

Us heathens enjoyed the temple grounds since the weather was nice. When my sister finally came out of the temple it was like her vitality had been sucked out of her. She was not as enthusiastic as she started. She was not even at her normal level of bubbliness. She just asked if someone would let her take a car to the church warehouse as she needed to buy new underthings and didnt want company. In a hypocritical but not all that unusual choice we all agreed to meet for Sunday dinner at Olive Garden an hour later.

Where the church was able to suppress its history without too much struggle the internet is bursting at the seams with easily accessible information to call the church to the carpet. And I think more and more millennials are realizing that they can find answers to their doctrinal questions so much easier online than via church leaders. Simply put our generation has been able to cut through the BS that GAs have been feeding church members since the beginning.

I specifically asked the matron and she said they used to instruct women to wear the garment top under the bra but the instructions had been changed to allow personal discretion. Of course most women didnt construe that to mean they could wear a bra under the stupid thing. If someone grew up in a TBM household they probably assumed it still had to be worn under the bra.

I cannot even express how much this has helped me not only physically but also mentally.  It has been a life saver for me.The other most helpful thing for me in moving out of mormonism and into a happy healthy and fulfilled life is volunteering in my community.  Just getting out and serving others helps so much.  I volunteer at the food band and at the clothing donation center a couple of days a week.  I dont think it matter where to volunteer so much as there is a need.  I mean for some reason it just gets gets me thinking of others or doing something in the present and gets me not thinking of myself.  It just has been so good in so many ways.Anyway please know we are here for each other and we all have our struggles but one day at a time it gets better.

11194544,0,t3_5ztbxg,My letter to Uchtdorf Dear President UchtdorfAfter viewing and reading most of the October Ensign that is published at LDS.ORG it was very apparent that the November  policy concerning kids of parents legally married in homosexual unions is a revelation from god. President Russel L. Nelsons article entitled Stand As True Millennials makes it quite clear. To quote from the articleAnd then when the Lord inspired His prophet President Thomas S. Monson to declare the mind and will of the Lord each of us during that sacred moment felt a spiritual confirmation. It was our privilege as Apostles to sustain what had been revealed to President Monson. Revelation from the Lord to His servants is a sacred process and so is your privilege of receiving personal revelationIf like President Nelson says this was a revelation from God it should be published as such so as not to diminish the significance.As you well know many people are challenging this policy as being unchristian. Making the churchs position very clear would eliminate most of the uncertainty surrounding this incident. If the November Policy came through revelation officially announce it as Revelation by way of inclusion in the DampC a special addendum or at the very least a letter from the First Presidency to be read to all members.No response ,exmormon,df0vzh0,7,t5_2r0gj

11270882,0,t1_df9h54s,As a kid who DIDNT grow up LDS allow me to offer this I spent my childhood praying and hoping for a brother I am a guy. I got a little sister instead and she is the best. Its a privilege to be her brother. But there was still that feeling.Here I am today with  boys no girls. I love being surrounded by so many guys that I can share so much with. It really feels like it makes up for what I felt like I missed in childhood. And as a man my last name has now got new legs to carry on into the future. So in one sense I might feel like I have Mormonism to thank for all of that.However as much as I would not trade a single one of my kids parenting and raising  is a challenge. We often feel overwhelmed and I dont get that sense from those with smaller families.If I were giving advice to one of my kids although they probably will never ask for my advice I would suggest three kids is a good maximum today. Two kids or one is fine as well depending on what you are looking for from a family life.With all of that said the burden to raising kids is whatever difference there is between the size of our family and the limits of our time and resources. That is a real burden. And it is stressful and need not be tested. It IS possible to have a family size that is appropriate for your resources and constraints. Saying otherwise is religious nonsense or wishful thinking by someone not willing to accept regrets.And believe it or not it is possible to both love each of your kids AND regret having so many.

It is an interesting time in the exmo world as we are receiving what many of us had desired for some time to have some type of insight into what is said by higher ups in the Church behind closed doors. But now that we have been seeing behind the curtain as much as it is interesting on a personal level the methods in which the information is being obtained could very well be crossing some ethical boundaries.

Joseph Smith was a prophet so powerful and wise he could use the Priesthood to influence members to create wives for himself. He had such a knowledge of the gospel he could even keep his wives from leaving him by receiving threatening revelation from God. Being the founder of the church was a pathway to many sexual attractions some consider unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did.

11433524,0,t1_dfrygbn,From LDS.org Talk Summary PagePerfect Love Casteth Out FearPresident Dieter F. UchtdorfSecond Counselor in the First PresidencyMy message has two purposes today The first is to urge us to contemplate and consider the extent to which we use fear to motivate othersincluding ourselves. The second is to suggest a better way. It is true that fear can have a powerful influence over our actions and behavior. But that influence tends to be temporary and shallow. Fear rarely has the power to change our hearts and it will never transform us into people who love what is right and who want to obey Heavenly Father. The more I come to know my Heavenly Father the more I see how He inspires and leads His children. He is not angry vengeful or retaliatory. His very purposeHis work and His gloryis to mentor us exalt us and lead us to His fullness see Moses  see also Ephesians . My beloved friends my dear brothers and sisters in Christ if we ever find ourselves living in fear or anxiety or if we ever find that our own words attitudes or actions are causing fear in others I pray with all the strength of my soul that we may become liberated from this fear by the divinely appointed antidote to fear the pure love of Christ for perfect love casteth out fear  John . As we fill our hearts with the love of Christ we will awaken with a renewed spiritual freshness and we will walk joyfully confidently awake and alive in the light and glory of our beloved Savior Jesus Christ.,exmormon,dfrz8ct,2,t5_2r0gj

11437624,0,t1_dfsdlgu,Thanks for these. Im not sure if the privacymeetings was with all the apostles or just a few but from what I was told every meeting with the GAs was recorded regardless of how many if it was an official meeting of some sort. I could be wrong about that though. As for bringing up claims or suing that didnt sound like something that was going to happen just a fear of lawsuits that could happen. The individual I spoke with didnt feel most of the people who are involved would do anything against the church just on the fact that theyre all temple recommend holding church broke individuals. The fear is the information getting out to the public that there was an investigation and that laws may have been broken and if there will be any prosecution that could come from it. Its the idea of secrecy regarding legal matters that others were not privy to even those who work in legal counsel. Its more of the effect of the news once the investigation is over or becomes public knowledge of its existence rather than who actually is impacted directly. Theyll let me know when more comes from this if there is even anything.,exmormon,dfsfzf1,1,t5_2r0gj

Kibera the slum that has received much attention is a truly awful place and needs to be addressed by the Kenyan government and the United Nations.   The LDS church will have little impact on this particular area.Kenya does have a highly developed capital city as well as many coastal cities and towns that would catch the eye of any Westerner.  However there are some real issues in Kenya as well.  Facts matter here.   of the population lives below the United Nations definition of poverty about  per day.  HIVAids impacts about  of the country crosses socioeconomic lines.  These are obviously areas for improvement.  That being said Kenya has a  education enrollment.

11459448,0,t3_63ki9c,gt Sometimes I actually feel that this sub does damage to the image of what an exMormon might represent.This is the pigeonholing mentality expressing itself. We have mormonism in common but how we choose to move on from it is an individual decision. The idea that we need to continue to fit a mold that others will approve of is a very mormon way of thinking. What will the neighbors think?There is no silver bullet to deconversion. FAIR would love it if their ad hominem attacks worked against those providing the information. Ive seen concerted attacks against Dehlin Runnells Kelley Norton etc. The implication is that if they are damaged then the side presenting opposition is somehow damaged. This is a weak argument and the ideas and information win out at least for those who are willing to ask some basic questions about their faith. Is the church open to addressing my concerns? Is this the church represented by the New Testament? Is this the onetruechurch as it claims to be?  Deep down am I interested in truth and justice?These questions dont rely on who is presenting the information. The generally anonymous nature of this forum allows anyone to tell their experience share their research or attempt to give some comedic relief from the depressing nature of mormon theology and implementation.

It was one of the early bypass surgeries my grandfather had to have another one and the second time around he chose a different surgeon who helped my grandfather change some eating habits that I think really did extend my grandfathers good life quite a bit.This same grandfather was a cousin to Elder Hales and when I was working on the Hotel Utah being converted to the JS Bldg I met then Bishop Hales just briefly but met H. David Burton a couple of times as he sat in meetings about the conversion.  I was an intern architect with FFKR architects at the time.  Burton was a bombast an asshole but not as arrogant as Nelson.My exwife met Elder Bruce R McConkie at a mission conference and even she a still TBM indicated how arrogant he was making the translation elders not a sister mind you redo what they were saying even though he didnt speak Spanish otherwise hed be talking it based on the Spirit telling him they didnt just translate it correctly for the congregation he was speaking to.Lets see I met Elder Angel Abrea a former Argentinian  and he was an asshole too.

If she would have come to me two years ago I would have blindly told her she needed to ask for help through prayer study her scriptures more and maybe even stop seeing this boy. This all sounds SO terrible to me now but as a tbm whos been indoctrinated since nursery thats what I would have done. I would not have even recognized how creepy this new bishop is although Im not stupid. This daughter has opened up to me so much in the last six months and Im positive its because she feels Im genuinely listening and that I want to support her rather than judgeetc. Our two teenagers still at home have not left the church but the openness felt in our home is pure joy.  As in my first post can anyone steer me to the doctrine about chastity and is it possible to get a copy of a bishops handbook.

11487078,0,t3_63yhuh,I consider myself agnostic.  That spirit I hear you frequently refer to I have deduced is nothing more than a psychological response to something we strongly agree with something that feels good to our soul and any impressions we have is nothing more than our conscience becoming aware to someonesomething.  I used to tell a story on my mission about spiritual promptings with my dad.  His computer had crashed in the days of floppy disks and with that all of his tax documents.  He was struggling to get it back.  We were driving one day and he saw a computer shop and was prompted to stop in and ask for help which worked by the way.  I recall him afterwards telling me rather emotionally that I should always listen to the spirit.I still follow that guidance if you feel like you can help you should do so.  But Ive come to believe that those feelings are nothing more than our own psyche.  Im no psychologist.  I am an engineer by trade.  Ironically enough the church school I attended taught me to reason myself out of the cardboard box that I now consider religion.  I think the human mind is far more powerful than we give ourselves credit.  We may consider ourselves lacking in intelligence not clever not well with words whatever but I think we should give far more credit for the mind we have which we hardly understand medically.With that I have deduced that IF God exists then why would he be so interested in the lives of billions of people.  I have a hard time comprehending the idea of omniscience apart from the typical God is all powerful therefore he can do whatever he wants.  That doesnt work.  Those claims essentially claim that a God who rules a universe does not abide by his own rules.  In my eyes now if God exists he is likely something more of the Futurama interpretation of God dont mind the poor quality   If God exists I can see him only as a benevolent force in the universe that does not directly interfere in the dealings with sentient life.  He may nudge things gently one way or another but he is definitely not petty enough to eternally torture those who dont see eye to eye with him.Quite frankly I try to live my life now and attempt to treat others as I would treat my family and friends.  It works for me and my conscience is clear if I die tomorrow.,exmormon,dfy24ps,2,t5_2r0gj

No offense BIC exmosits just a very distinct culture and hard to adapt to. Im sure I still break rules without realizing it even here.The WRITTEN rules might be almost too appealing to some people making it harder for them to get along in the real world outside Mormonism. So many Mormon leaders have set ridiculously arbitrary and exacting standards of behavior check out The Miracle of Forgiveness by Spencer W.

I have never been disappointed when talking to critics of theists after learning this simple trick.  And the trick is just to set my expectations at very low levels.gt Although Im sure nothing I say in this final reply will make a difference to you because youve already got all the answers and cant possibly learn anything more praise Yehoshua allow me to just get some closure for my own benefit eh?Now that really sounds like the beginning of a horrible ending...gt A casual study of the textual history of the books of the new testament shows that at absolute best the gospels are firsthand accounts long after the events they describe theyre full of contradictions and theres a good chance that if there was a historical person named Yehoshua of Nazareth who went around teaching radical antiestablishment doctrines the claims to divinity were added in by overzealous followers after the fact. Even if the guy existed and made those claims Ive still got no reason to believe them.If you have succeeded at convincing yourself that there is no God based on a casual study of the evidence then I am not surprised.Now can you blame me that I have very low expectations when talking with agnostics and atheists?gt You still dont understand what appeal to authority means and while I would love to invite you to read up on it I guess thats not really your thing. You see books are just a means of conveying information. If I were saying that its true just because its in a book gee who does that sound like he asked sarcastically then yes Id be a real dunce. Thats not what Im saying.Oh you forgot.... You disputed my claim order is not the result of accident by a counter claim We see order randomly emerging all the time.  You called my claim bullshit but when I asked for evidence on your rebuttal your best evidence was to ask me to read a book.If you can really SEE order randomly emerging ALL THE TIME then throwing a book at me is not the best way to do it.  You should be able to cite hundreds of examples in less than two sentences...Ah but you failed to do that.  Now can you blame me if I have very low expectations when talking to agnostics and atheists?gt However were all busy people and since I personally dont have the time and means to retest every principle of scientific thought I do have to put a certain amount of trust in for example Sir Isaac Newton that he wasnt deliberately dicking with us all when he recorded his observations and that this doesnt mean he was right about everything or even anything!Therefore your restrictions in life forces you to trust the work of scientists.  I like that word... trust .... because it resembles FAITHThe question is not whether scientists are dicking us all with their methods but whether the data or phenomena theyre observing is not dicking them.  What reasons do scientists have to tell us that the physical world that gives them data for their work is not deceiving them?  Can science alone tell you that?gt You should learn about the scientific method even if youre skeptical of itI am not skeptical of the scientific method.  The Catholic Church helped give birth to Science as we know it.  Just look at the moon and its features many of its craters are named after the Jesuits who discovered them.  Galileo was a Catholic.  Volta was a Catholic. LeMaitre was a Catholic priest. Many of the great scientists we know are Catholics.Rather I am skeptical of those who think that science alone can explain every phenomena in the world.  I am skeptical of those who conclude there is no God after doing a casual study on the subject.  For example Richard Dawkins Sam Harris or Lawrence Krauss.  They may be excellent in their fields of specialization but cringeworthy when it comes to theology.gt I have done quite a lot of scientific experimentation in my field. Your addiction shows.  You have a highly developed superstition on science called scientism.gt The scientific method continues to be a reliable way to find out shit that then tends to be reliable in the real world. Its got a way better track record than prayer reading the bible for answers or warm fuzzies.Oh.... So science is reliable except in those cases when science is not reliable.  How am I suppose to convince a scientifically minded eugenicist that injecting syphilis virus on a black person for the purpose of controlling their population is utter bullshit?  Does science have the reasons and tools for that?gt As I said you clearly possess an unassailable mind and already know all you need or care to know. I am an exmormon who changed my mind on Mormonism.  And I drifted in agnosticism like you. What makes you a good judge on the things that can or cannot change my mind?  Because you are a scientific person?No youre not.  You only have a superstitious faith in science that science does not deserve.  In other words you are full of bullshit.,exmormon,dg631wq,1,t5_2r0gj

11600403,0,t3_65k2je,We are thankful for the Pagen holiday called Easter celebrating the Norse goddess Ostara Eostre and the many tales about her and the hares.  The Spring goddess bringing her colored eggs and wishing us a prosperous season.Festival of Ostara Eostre the Spring Goddess.  This is a festival of renewal rejoicing and fertility although for most of the Northern People the forces of Winter are still at full sway.  In ancient times the gift of colored eggs to ones friends and loved ones was a way of wishing them well for the coming season a magical ritual of prosperity and fecundity.  The rabbit was the symbol of this festival as well because of its reemergence during this season and for its reproductive ability.  These two rituals have survived into the modern holiday of Easter which derives its name from Eostre as Easter eggs and the Easter bunny.  Like most ancient heathen rituals they are relegated into the world of children held for naught among adults but the race memory lingers on.  Origins of the name EasterThe name Easter originated with the names of an ancient Goddess and God. The Venerable Bede  CE a Christian scholar first asserted in his book De Ratione Temporum that Easter was named after Eostre a.k.a. Eastre. She was the Great Mother Goddess of the Saxon people in Northern Europe. Similarly the Teutonic dawn goddess of fertility was known variously as Ostare Ostara Ostern Eostra Eostre Eostur Eastra Eastur Austron and Ausos.  Her name was derived from the ancient word for spring eastre. Similar Goddesses were known by other names in ancient cultures around the Mediterranean and were celebrated in the springtime. ,exmormon,dgawxky,5,t5_2r0gj

If one accepts that Jesus is the ultimate example and Jesus drank at all much less enough to be accused of being a drunkard then there is nothing inherently wrong with alcohol. This means the word of wisdom is simply an exercise in obedience much like the Old Testament dietary restrictions. Its a simple if then logical conclusion based upon premises easily accepted by Christians. Maybe reasoning with your husband along these lines will help? If alcohol is the worst things for families why did Jesus drink it?You seem to be able to approach things delicately so I believe you are capable of using that approach in a delicate manner. I think your husbands reaction is completely unreasonable but emotionally understandable. Maybe helping him understand his belief that alcohol is inherently bad has a poor doctrinal foundation using logic based on the premise of Jesus as the ultimate example will help temper his emotional reaction.This is a tough situation. Hopefully you can help him understand you value him and understand his concerns but that he should extend some trust your way. Good luck!Scriptural sourcesMatthew Luke ,exmormon,dgb4saz,4,t5_2r0gj

Reminds me of a philosophy paper I had to write a long time ago.  I had to prove that God existed.  Then I had to prove that God didnt exist.  It was hard to argue both sides because proof doesnt exist.  Facts and science help sure but its not  proof.So using that example you and I arent  right when it comes to the church and my wife isnt  wrong.  So I dont worry about whos right.

Children do not understand the concept of doing boring things that pay off and they will always seek the more fun activity.  Thats why most children try to get out of homework and school.This is one of the difficulties of mixedfaith marriages.  I left the church before my thenwife and while I was Episcopalian she was Mormon.  Those two religious outlooks are not compatible at all and there were a lot of fights.  Many times what was needed was that both of us had to settle down and look at the other persons perspective.  We came to an agreement.But even though my now exwife is Episcopalian too and a good friend we still disagree with each other at times.  I feel that when the children turn twelve they can make the choice to stay home from choice her perspective is that they should be a bit older.

11661229,0,t1_dgh92v9,Yes language is messy and imperfect.Forget Arrivalhave you read Thomas Paines The Age of Reason? Paine argues that no sensible God would rely on such a fallible vehicle as human language for transmitting an important message. Much more sensible says Paine to think of the creation itself as the gospel. As Paine puts it in terms that I hope will suggest to you the utter inadequacy of the Book of Mormon as a gospel restored or otherwiseThe word of God is creation we behold. And it is in this word which no human invention can counterfeit or alter that God speaketh universally to man. Human language is local and changeable and is therefore incapable of being used as the means of unchangeable and universal information.... But how was Jesus Christ to make anything known to all nations? He could speak but one language which was Hebrew and there are in the world several hundred languages. Scarcely any two nations speak the same language or understand each other and as to translations every man who knows anything of languages knows that it is impossible to translate from one language into another not only without losing a great part of the original but frequently of mistaking the sense and besides all this the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time Christ lived.It is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish any end be equal to the accomplishment of that end or the end cannot be accomplished. It is in this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wisdom discovers itself. Man frequently fails in accomplishing his end from a natural inability of the power to the purpose and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly. But it is impossible for infinite power and wisdom to fail as man faileth. The means it useth are always equal to the end but human language more especially as there is not an universal language is incapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform information and therefore it is not the means that God useth in manifesting himself universally to man.It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of God can unite. The Creation speaketh an universal language independently of human speech or human language multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever existing original which every man can read. It cannot be forged it cannot be counterfeited it cannot be lost it cannot be altered it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds and this word of God reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of God.,exmormon,dghtcso,1,t5_2r0gj

11670278,0,t3_66i386,Can I offer this?The churchs view of porn is just flat wrong.However nearly any good marital counselor will tell you that honesty and transparency matters in a marriage. Transparency is the very definition of intimacy. It means you are open with your spouse in ways you would never be open to others.Point being that if your wife would be upset by you viewing porn and you do it anyway you are risking that intimacy and honesty. Dont go running off and tell her. That wont help anyone. But decide if you truly wantneed porn in your life. If you do youll need to talk to your wife about it and at least come to an understanding.Masturbation? Have at it. I realize this might seem equivalent to porn but it just is not. I agree that it can be highly beneficial to a marriage where libidos might not be equivalent.This is just my personal advice. This is how I try and live and I feel pretty guilt free. If my wife caught me touching myself I think I could easily look her in the eyes and say well duh!. But if she caught me viewing porn Id feel bad. I know she wouldnt like it. And if SHE matters to me then THAT matters to me. Plus porn does have some negatives. Primarily that it is massively misogynistic. Again just my opinion.Speaking for myself if I have ever looked at porn in those instances I would much rather have been looking at my wife but for whatever reason she was unavailable to me. If this describes you then that tells you a lot about where your heart is. If when you look at porn it is because you desperately want to see someone else naked then maybe you still have more soul searching to do.,exmormon,dgiubc0,4,t5_2r0gj

11727863,0,t1_dgpcy0i,The notion of stealing being bad is socially constructed.You seem to resort to unnecessary ad hominems when challenged. Frankly it is absurd for you to conclude on the basis of reddit comments that I would have supported slavery or racial segregation or that I have supported LGBT discrimination.I have already recognized that social mores are imperfect and inherently arbitrary and ought not to be accepted  much less followed  unquestioningly.  I agree with you that social norms should be grounded in logic and reason.That said I also need to raise my children so that they can function in society at each age. Have you ever met a fiveyearold? Mine picks up language everywhere  from friends from family from TV from out in public. If I take him to a familyfriendly environment only to have him bombarded with fucks all night it would be entirely predictable for him to start using fuck left and right regardless of context. Thats the thing that we should be able to appreciate as adults  context matters. Blowjobs are fine but maybe not in public. Saying fuck is fine but maybe not in every situation. I may use fuck around friends but when Im in court  I am a lawyer by the way  I am not going to tell the judge that I think hes a fucking idiot for overruling an objection. Nor am I going to ask a witness why the fuck did you just lie under oath?Why? Its not because Im a prude or because I think fuck is a dirty word or because Im a racist or homophobe or bigot. Its because I recognize that social norms matter even if I completely disagree with them and that in order to function as an adult in society it is in my interest to be mindful of those norms. This is exactly why I dont bring pork chops to potlucks with Jewish friends or booze to LDS Church activities. I think it is a marker of maturity to recognize that sometimes we are more likely to get along better with our fellow humans when we can pick up on social cues and respect them even if we think they are silly.Is this to say that social norms should always be accepted and followed?  No.  Not by any means. Homophobia racism sexism and other bigotry should be fought and resisted at every opportunity.But come on. We arent talking about racism or homophobia. Were talking about saying fuck in a setting where commonly accepted standards of politeness and decency frown upon it. Exercising a bit of discretion in choosing your words doesnt exactly harm you and it may go a long way toward building mutual respect and good will in your relations with others.Just a thought.,exmormon,dgpdtrq,1,t5_2r0gj

11738734,0,t1_dgqjnzs,Thats kind of a crap attitude to have. I live in an area with a large thriving LGBTQ community so maybe thats why myself and others dont feel so burnt out about helping other people reach a healthy understanding of a group they maybe havent had adequate exposure to. Like I get that dealing with ignorance is tiring but right now what youre doing is essentially thisPicture a world where the majority of the population has blue skin. Some people have green skin but they dont exist in large concentrations outside of certain population centers. The green skinned people in many areas are raised to hide or shun what they really are makeup heavy clothes lets not dig too deep into this metaphor which means many blue skinned people have little to no awareness of green skinned people or how they live or how they could be their neighbor or friend. This opens up a lot of potential areas for bigotry and misunderstanding to form.Now one day a blue skinned person meets another person and this other person proudly asserts that they have green skin. This blue skinned person considers themselves open minded and they are now understandably curious. They attempt to get more information from this person who only moments ago so confidently told them about a rare trait they had only to receive It isnt my job to educate you as a response. The conversation has been killed before it started blue person feels as though they have been attacked for trying to be open minded. Now maybe theyre thinking back to things some less tolerant members of the blue skinned community have said and theyre maybe giving those things some more credence. After all that one green skinned person was kind of a dick and theyve literally only met the one so this has clowded their entire view of green skinned people. Maybe they do use Google but with no existing background or knowledge in the area of green people maybe they read shit sources and suddenly their view of green skinned people is worse than ever before because they self educated which doesnt always go well.Or the green skinned person could have a five minute conversation and enlighten a sheltered individual about the broader world of humans around them. Hopefully create a new ally. Demonstrate that green skinned people are in fact just people. Refusing to converse just further others you and makes you seem aloof. It backfires every time Ive heard what people mutter in public after being yelled at to educate themselves. If someone is willing to at least enter into a conversation dont slam the door on them.TLDR No life isnt easy and yes a lot of people treat LGBTQ folks like literal garbage but if we all start being dicks then how is anyone supposed to learn to love us?Sorry that youre stuck in a land of ignorance come out to the coastal cities then you wont have to explain a thing to anyone.,exmormon,dgqm60o,37,t5_2r0gj

Smith then age  was finally arrested and hauled before a NY court on  March  to answer for his fraud schemes and disorderly conduct. On compelling witnesses testimony the court found Smith guilty and he was ordered to pay a fine and court costs.As L. Ron Hubbard would likewise do after running afoul of the law sometime later it occurred to Smith that hed be free to run his con if he did it in the context of religion.

My parents were initially okay with that but recently said they think I should wait until after my mission. Doesnt matter if I dont serve though. Im considering enlisting without their permission since Im legally an adult and using that to help break the news. Ive thought if I can wait I can enlist secretively get my basic date and just before I ship out I can talk to them and say here is the deal Im not serving a mission and Im leaving the church.

Someones crisis of being lied to couldve come much later in life. For the church after it hving ruined there supposed marriage day.I for one glad of his video! As made me reaffirm never go get married in the temple!This videos helps other converts like yourself or others within the church so they can learn whats been hidden from them.He even obscured the identities of the people involved as well. eg the wedding video.Plus what your saying is more morals based had newnamenoah broken the law he be in jail but where he is he hasnt broken any laws.
