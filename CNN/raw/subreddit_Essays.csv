Im thinking of annoying customers in retail. Maybe you had a summer job where your coworker had different view and almost screwed you over.st chunk of words few paragraphsYour experiencesbeliefs before you met the person or people with conflicting viewsnd chunk of wordsYour experience with those people. Story time! Nobody wants to sift through boring essays in their free time.This can be long!Last chunk of wordsThe persons peoples effect on you     i.e.  In some ways I pity Bob. As a meateater working in a vegetarian restaurant Bob was not suited for this job. Even though I kept advising him not to eat steak in front of the customers he refused. Customers began to flee in fear of smelling meat. That was when I knew why Bob was being such a jerk. Some people plainly disagree with my beliefs and there is nothing I can do about it. The best I can do is . . . some confident statement. . . As much as I hated Bob I would have never become the person I am insert strong alarming or generic statementWell that was a terrible example but you get what I mean. I hope so.,Essays,cwmhkcu,1,t5_2qoai

10408172,0,t3_5ozzcr,Hi. Just quickly looking through and I see that your essay has a lot of fluff. Cut the descriptions of the school. The school wants to know about YOU. Why do you want to become a nurse? You dont really talk about it. Were you inspired by a famous nurse? What have you learned already about nursing? Did you have any nursing related accomplishments at community college? Your section on community college is not unusual what was a big change compared to high school and why? I would completely cut that part unless your high school experience was very unusual. ,Essays,dcnu1dr,2,t5_2qoai
