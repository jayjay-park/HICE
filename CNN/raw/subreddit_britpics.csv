2899064,0,t3_2soq1w,FWIW since I am a bored exhistory major this was how much was dumped. By the light of the lanterns the Mohawks did their work smashing their way with hatchets through  chests  tons of tea.  Enough to make it has been estimated to make  million cupsThen they made sure all the tea was damaged ad nobody grabbed some tea to sell on the side.
