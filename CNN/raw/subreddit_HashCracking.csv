And they dont natively support distributed work but a controller like Hashtopus can be used to cluster machines together. As I said before extracting the hash and posting it here would allow for someone like myself to attack the archive password with already built and optimized attacks. I have a fair amount of hardware that  dedicate to cracking. It would likely be faster and easier to let someone already set up attack it. ,HashCracking,dbhhgg9,1,t5_39s45
