11109718,0,t1_demq1m5,I definitely think one of the twins was the choker because when Celeste asked the twins on the couch if she thought Ziggy actually choked Amabele one said yes right away and the other  simultaneously said no right away which makes me think the one that said yes was the choker and the twin that said no knew it was the other twin who did it JMO ,biglittlelies,der9za4,1,t5_36k8r

11258947,0,t1_df73b9d,We have to remember that the therapist has met Perry which gives context to the abuse. The question isnt if this behavior is irreparable in general but rather is Perry going to stop. Beyond just the usual statistic of escalating domestic violence the therapist has seen the dynamic between Perry and Celeste. Has seen Perry try to manipulate her perception of their problems. Her professional judgement is clear...Celeste needs to GTFO before she or her children get hurt. ,biglittlelies,df86nvy,5,t5_36k8r

11426543,0,t3_6339nh,This show and finale was such a fun ride! Love how they kept us guessing till the end ... every time a character looked at someone else made me think they were going to be the killervictim. And how it all builds up to the five women ending up on that staircase the very one they repeatedly showed as being offlimits and Madelaine crossing it was such great foreshadowing. Great finale but bittersweet ending because it makes me want more of these characters!,biglittlelies,dfr6qok,3,t5_36k8r
11426751,0,t1_dfr5a1e,Oh yeah I didnt even think about that. The main issue is still the lack of evidence so the therapist would have to get to the point where getting the twins out of the situation is worth the possible consequences for celeste. Like if she reports but all they have is celestes word and CPS cant do anything? So the twins go back and either Perry divorces her and takes full custody like was discussed an episode or so ago or suddenly escalates to the point of killing her or badly hurting her or the twins.  I wonder how DV therapists handle this situation IRL. ,biglittlelies,dfr7l6h,3,t5_36k8r

I get why they did it but hated it. I was so engrossed in the book I didnt guess the ending and just enjoyed it in one night. A miniseries does probably make it more obvious as you have  days between episodes to pick apart the clues and suspect lists etc. ,biglittlelies,dftnpe6,10,t5_36k8r
