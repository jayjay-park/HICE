4625692,0,t1_ctdiqiw,Just want to echo what the poster above said. Redding is the opposite of progressive and is about the hottest place I know of outside of Death Valley. The summers here are horrendous and this cannot be understated. Sacramento gets hot too but cools off a lot more especially in the evenings.Sacramento is a much larger city than Redding so kinda depends on what youre looking for. Sacramento will also put you much closer to San Francisco for day trips if that suits your fancy. Ive lived in Redding for  years and am desperate to leave. Im pretty jaded so Im pretty bias against this place so take what I say with a grain of salt. For what youve stated youre looking for though I would not choose Redding. Chico is sort of in between Redding and Sacramento and is a college town. Theres a lot more going on there and would be a better choice for you imo.,Redding,ctdn3ju,3,t5_2sbgo

8058539,0,t3_4phkrf,Depends on what your expectations are. If you want killer night life and to eat at hot trendy restaurants holy shit dont move to Redding. If you want a beautiful place with tons of outdoor recreation options pretty good school options and a place where you can buy a great house for an affordable price and raise a family Redding is pretty good.As far as the heat yeah it is hot in the summer but it is far from the biggest con of the city.Homelessness is a problem in the city but if you are going to have a web developer income it will be a very easy problem to avoid if you choose.Its pretty hard to find someone if you are young and single. I lucked out and met a pretty and intelligent woman but there arent a lot of young people.A final note of renting if you plan on settling in and buying a house there are a lot of good options particularly in the k range. However the rental market is kinda weird. There arent really high end apartments like there are in places like Portland. So its kinda rent a house for way too much money rent an affordable and safe yet mediocere apartment or make the commitment and buy a places.,Redding,d4lutqe,3,t5_2sbgo
8483865,0,t3_4vtgha,Why dont you visit California for a week or two before deciding where to move? Couchsurf andor AirBNB andor hostel. Rent a car or hop on Craigslist rides along the .

9772069,0,t1_dahi65r,Her husband works at Best Buy.  Indeed he was at work when this all happened.  Why would a  year old and a  year old need to be homeschooled?  The  year old is just barely old enough for optional preschool.  What I wonder is if she does not work then how do they afford daycare?  If their only income is the  an hour off Best Buy then they are technically living in poverty.  ,Redding,dahmgxe,12,t5_2sbgo
