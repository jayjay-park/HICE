2442619,0,t1_cmdjjwy,Thank you both very much for your help and intervention.I like your version especially the first two versesMikor a szemedbe nzek a tengert ltom.Mikor a tengerbe nzek a szemedet ltom.I chose your second version for second line. I guess from your explanation it would be more close to the way one would look in someones eyes downwards into the deep so it should be the same for the sea.This part has this nice steady flow and rhythm which feels right since it is just stating the obvious situation of being with one person and missing home i.e. the sea and being home missing this person and hisher blue eyes.Im still unsure about the last lineverse. Unfortunately my knowledge of Hungarian grammar is severely limited and Im not able to read poetry in Hungarian so its difficult for me to get the sense of what works. But in this case I would like to emphasize the impossibility of the simultaneousat the same time part and put that at the end of the verse like here mirt nem tudok itt s ott lenni egyidejleg?or mirt nem lehetek itt is s ott is egyszerre?Is this allowed does it work that way?Thank you again hope this was a fun problem to think about ,hungarian,cmdm275,2,t5_2xeuq

7938463,0,t3_4nz7g0,Yes and no.If you ask do you drink? in English youre implying alcohol. The literal translation iszol? in Hungarian carries an implied future tense and means roughly are you havingwill you have something to drink?  as if someone is offering you a bottle of something  and can be used with but certainly does not imply alcohol. For that youd have to ask something like iszol alkoholt? or szoktl alkoholt inni? but youd much more likely be asked iszol srtbortplinkt? beerwinebrandy to which your reply would probably be nem nem szoktam alkoholtsrtbortplinkt inni.However your second example question did he drink tonight? ma este ivott? does imply alcohol in both languages.This is all glossing over the fact that alkohol isnt really used as a metonym for alcoholic beverages in Hungarian the way that alcohol is in English which Ive ignored above. The formal term for alcoholic beverage is szeszes ital and the common casual term is pia. So youre much more likely to hear either the specific examples I listed with beerwineplinka above or neologisms like pizol? roughly do you booze v.? when someone is asking whether you ever drink alcoholic beverages.Sorry for the dissertation...,hungarian,d48cwlt,9,t5_2xeuq

11143549,0,t3_5z3zi9,Meg on its own means and plus or additionally. Mg on its own can mean yet another or even depending on the context. And meg as part of a verb... is quite hard to explain. The best way I could describe it is comparing it to the German auf or ge or even the Swedish fre as in frekomma. It changes the meaning of verbs narrows them down in a very specific fashion and cannot really be translated on its own. Best thing to do is just really learn the verb compounds it is part of by heart as every word will have a specific meaning with it and there are other similar verb additions as well and you cant really predict how each one will effect specific verbs. Sorry for the bad explanation and I hope this helped. ,hungarian,dev3yhs,4,t5_2xeuq
