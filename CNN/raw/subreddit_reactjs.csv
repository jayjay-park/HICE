4406623,0,t1_csk48c5,It may be just my bad interpretation of some statements Im still fairly new to Flux and coming from MVC this could be quite mindboggling sometimes.From gt . actions are fire and forget no callbacks!My interpretation was no callbacks in ActionCreators but he says no callbacks in Actions. So he meant dont send any callback in Actions payload? That would make sense and still be ok with my option number .  And from gt No Cascading ActionsgtFlux disallows dispatching a second action as a result of dispatching an action. This helps prevent hardtodebug cascading updates and helps you think about interactions in your application in terms of semantic actions.But probably in my case this isnt a result of dispatching an action rather dispatching other action based on a API result.,reactjs,csmczzk,1,t5_2zldd

4791098,0,t1_ctyf912,I havent really done a lot of Flux in production yet so correct me if I am wrong. IMHO yes but the trouble occurs when you have a piece of data you want to share between twomore components. React doesnt have any facility for that. In flux these shared data are called stores. Flux just makes it possible to listen to events from stores. Flux is just over engineered event emitter pattern with event ordering they say. Actually substack says that. ,reactjs,ctyggkn,1,t5_2zldd

5002972,0,t1_cuol5cu,I think its ok for an action creator to hold simple logic especially around async loading. Then your store can have more logic and can work synchronous which helps a lot.Regarding the main question I think it good that React dont force you to do it a specific way it means you can choose what suits your project best. If you need a little help to do something complex there are probably som library doing just that.To repeat your action creator could check authorization every time and then tell the store if it worked or not and any subscribers would get that info. Or you could wrap components in authorization components that shows the content or the login form. Or do something else the subscriptions system with stores is really good at handling of lot of things.

Having your template injected via a decorator and having to include modules the Angular way by importing it as well as noting what you need at the top of each component in a decorator is annoying as fuck.  Also why stick with selectors?  Why not use component names?  Why do I need to attach all that to the ng global object?  Why cant I just specify a component use it in my template and have Angular say... this isnt a typical html component.  There must be a class with the same name.  Oh here it is imported at the top of this module.  The most convoluted part of Angular  is the component definition.  React made the right choice IMHO getting away from the custom definition object.

6775736,0,t3_48k852,Hiya.  Im admittedly still very light on the actual handson side of Redux atm in terms of actual LOC written but hopefully I can at least point in the direction of some useful resources.  And in fact the first pointer Id give is to the Reactiflux community on Discord which has a bunch of chat channels dedicated to various Reactrelated libraries such as Redux.  The invite link is over at  .I can give you a couple semianecdotal references to people who have actually used and scaled Redux.  First a tweet from Nick Presta of WaveHQ   Second Chris Pearce from Lystable did a presentation on their use of Redux on Monday  .Beyond that what sort of scaling issues are you concerned about?  Codebase structure and organization?  Managing state updates?  UI refresh speed?  API calls?You mentioned relational data.  My goto suggestion link for that is a nifty library called reduxorm which provides a Modellike facade over the plain JS data in your Redux store and handles relations and immutable updates.  Also while Im very firmly in camp Redux there are a number of people who seem to be very happy using the MobX library recently renamed from mobservable to handle their state instead and that it lets them keep their data denormalized paging umweststrate !Im not quite sure what youre looking for in terms of documentation search strategies.  What documentation are you looking for?  How have you been you searching so far and what pages have you found?  What issues are you having?Ill toss in two specific resources that Ive been working on putting together.  The first is   which is meant to be a curated collection of highquality tutorials and resources for learning React Redux and the related ecosystem.  The second is my currentlyWIP Redux FAQ page at  .edit the FAQ has now been published and is in the Redux docs at  .Hopefully that gives you a few relevant and useful things to think about.  If you could provide some more information as to what specific things youre hoping to find and what additional questions you have Id be happy to try to help either here on Reddit or over in Reactiflux.,reactjs,d0kba84,8,t5_2zldd
6852376,0,t1_d0sn96i,Honestly Ive been feeling the same way about form state in general lately. Ive tried out libraries like reduxform but it just feels more natural to keep validation and from state with the component. I find that using redux for database state and components for ui state managed by higher order components for the most part to be a pretty nice separation.  ,reactjs,d0t0wtj,3,t5_2zldd
6852990,0,t1_d0sn96i,I completely agree it is just choosing wisely when to use it and how to use it because in many cases it makes much more sense to use it. For example I find animation requires component state and I see no alternative.I think materialui has great examples of how to do it right many of their components use an internal state but provide properties to override when needed. Originally some of their components relied too heavily on state like LeftNav which required function calls on the component to openclose and was a pain to integrate with a global redux state but have since augmented this with an open prop which can be used with the likes of Redux to control the state and instead provide events that would signify an internal state change which you can hook into your Redux actions to update your global state if you so require.,reactjs,d0t3f3u,2,t5_2zldd
6917500,0,t3_4agtel,gt Im a total beginnerMy suggestion is to get some more experience with React first At least to the point where youve recognized what problems flux solves.IME obviously depending on what youre doing you dont need any flux libraryarchitecture.

7191290,0,t3_4dxndr,If LeftNav and Header have a common parent chances are what you want to do is pass the state which describes whether or not the left nav is open from said common parent to LeftNav. The common parent can ALSO pass to Header a click handler for the hamburger icon so that when it is clicked it fires an action that can ultimately invert the state of the LeftNavs visibility.    function Parent        leftNavOpen        setLeftNavOpen             return             ltdivgt                ltHeader onHamburgerClick gt setLeftNavOpen!leftNavOpen gt                leftNavOpen ? ltLeftNav gt  undefined            ltdivgt                    export default connect        state gt leftNavOpen state.leftNavOpen        dispatch gt             setLeftNavOpennewValue                 dispatchtype SETLEFTNAVOPEN payload newValue                        ParentThis example is not complete but describes a more or less reasonable pattern. You may for instance not want to completely remove the nav from the DOM when its not visible. You may want animation etc. But more or less this should work.If you need to you could also connect LeftNav and Header individually to achieve a similar effect without passing props down though in general its best not to connect more components than you need to there is definitely nuance involved in what should be connected!.Generally react best practices anyways encourages top down communication. Utilities like connect from reactredux make this much easier than with vanilla react. When youre looking for communication to parent or sibling components you will often find that the best thing to do is fire actions which make this state part of your store. That way you can connect to the store from said parent or any ancestor of the parent! to get access to the state. There are many benefits to keeping state in your store rather than a component and being able to easily connect said state to any component you feel you should is just one of those benefits.If you have any questions feel free to ask ,reactjs,d1vl7ww,3,t5_2zldd

8039882,0,t3_4pbq2x,You do have some valid points.  As you said almost any real app is going to do some async work.  Let me try to throw out some answers. That... seems odd.  I know the official React docs jump right into an example that uses fetch and a number of the other tutorials Ive seen do AJAX work as well. That question also seems kind of odd.  Browsers basically do HTTP over TCP.  What other forms of communication are you envisioning and for what purpose? Redux has deliberately tried to keep as minimal a core API as possible.  Technically core Redux itself only supports synchronous dispatching of plain action objects.  Its only through the use of store enhancers like applyMiddleware that other behaviors become possible.  So in that respect anything thats not synchronously dispatching a plain action is indeed advanced.  Thunks were briefly a part of the core API during early development I think and later split out so the package could be updated separately if necessary and even though its only one tiny function that has indeed happened with reduxthunk .. and the withExtraArgument addition.  Sagas were developed completely separately by someone else entirely well after Redux itself had reached stability.Also the Redux docs are trying to carefully walk newcomers through a number of topics they may not be familiar with such as pure functions reducers and immutably updating data.  That said pretty much the entire Advanced section walks you through why you would want to use middleware and what handling AJAX actions might look like.  So thats not exactly hidden away.Ive spent a good chunk of time making some additions to the docs such as the new FAQ page.  If youve got suggestions for improvements please say something or file an issue.

One of the benefits of putting all application state in redux is that it becomes easier for other components to access that state if they need to. You can decide whether putting this state in the redux store is the best thing for your app but you shouldnt feel as though in some way keeping the content of an input element in the redux store is fundamentally wrong.,reactjs,d4ni1b2,2,t5_2zldd

I had a clusterfuck of a UI element that needed to fetch data then fetch two sources of data based on the first data then dispatch to set a few different parts of state.

8135392,0,t3_4qm8ct,Im using Redux to store server state for an IoT project of mine The basic gist of the project is that a little WiFiconnected microcontrollers is plugged into each meeting room. Said microcontrollers are equipped with LEDs controlled by the server which governs what color to light the LED based on inputs from several different sources. e.g. if our reservations API says the meeting endtime is near the LED flashes red to tell the occupants to Get The Fuck Out. These sources of input range from an external API providing meeting reservation information to the microcontrollers themselves providing data through sensor modules.All of these inputs go through a Redux reducer where the state is updated and WebSocket events are emitted as necessary So Redux is doing more than just handling state its acting as sort of an event bus. Definitely not what Redux was designed for but I feel that it works really well.The project includes a frontend client that displays an overview of all the meeting rooms with their current reservation status. Relevant to your chatroom example when a client connects an action is dispatched from the WebSocket server with the client ID and the client is immediately sent the state of the roomsOverall Im very happy with the choice and have not run into any problems. Redux on the server provides the exact same benefits it provides on client applications  state stays untangled and async actions become way easier to reason about and organize.,reactjs,d4uhpxs,3,t5_2zldd

8312133,0,t1_d5gjq71,Granted I am not expert on ay but my understanding is that you need to accurately reflect the semantics of your UI so that someone can navigate it. Blind people must navigate it by basically tabbing from element to element. If content changes it is usually due to an action they took and they should be aware of that action and intended result. At which point they continue to navigate. If youre talking about new data being pushed using a websocket I am not sure the best way to.announce that.

9197494,0,t3_55c939,I hate to resurrect an old thread but I have about a year and a half of Angular .x experience. Havent moved over to .x. I cant find a single thing that I can do in React more easily than Angular. For me its trivial to spin up a singlepage app with routing a navbar animated fade infade out a clearly decoupled view clientbusiness dataaccess layer etc. If I get a bug its trivial to find. Always like at the View Model first in the controller. No race conditions like in jquery. I look at ReactJS examples and its always a lot of code to do something really tiny. Compared to Angular . components streamlined directives I feel like React just provides one small piece of what Angular already does pretty easily. For someone who can already put together a pretty huge web app with routing dynamic forms animations parallax navbar promises etc what does ReactJS really do for me? I cant find a single usecase that ReactJS can do better than Angular especially when Im writing giant web apps that have a dozen pages on them. All the logic seems to be in these individual React components. But I dont see where you main app logic is. How is data shared between React components easily? How do you know the dependencies for each React component without dependency injection? The main advantage I see to React is the ability to join any frontend team and add value whereas with Angular you only add value to a team if it is already using Angular or willing to switch to it.

9694945,0,t1_da82deo,First of all Im very confused about your way of defining components with WrappedComponent gt ....Are you doing this for some specific reason or are you just confused about how to define components? Normally they are defined like this    export class FirstComponent extends React.Component       render         return ltdiv gt  or something else          As for your specific question I shouldve explained I dont suggest extracting a function and then binding it. I suggest extracting a function that does not depend on this and calling it.In your example it could look like    function assignOptionsprops newOption callback         props.updateOptionsprevOptions gt            Object.assign prevOptions newOption            callback                export class FirstComponent extends React.Component         doSomething             assignOptionsthis.props test                render              ...                export class SecondComponent extends React.Component         doSomethingElse             assignOptionsthis.props test                render              ...            In general though your examples look a bit misguided  confused.

9773184,0,t3_5f4uvl,Didnt read all the articles but at least in the intro article I didnt see any mention about structural sharing which I think is one of the great benefits of immutable data structures.From gt These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized by Clojure and Scala minimizing the need to copy or cache data.From gt it implements fully persistent data structures from scratch using advanced things like tries to implement structural sharing. All updates return new values but internally structures are shared to drastically reduce memory usage and GC thrashing. This means that if you append to a vector with  elements it does not actually create a new vector elements long. Most likely internally only a few small objects are allocated.Also I feel that your analysis of the documentation is misleading. You make the reader think that that piece of documentation from map is all you are showing the reader rather than just the first line of a pretty long page. The documentation is actually really informative and useful  I think documentation should have all the details so more technically advanced people can go in and understand it but there still should be examples for those not as advanced which I definitely see vanilla JS examples in there. ,reactjs,dahrevt,5,t5_2zldd

10248078,0,t3_5mqmzi,gt Also can I use the same action to flip some bool flag in another component?Redux doesnt care about your components. Redux keeps all the data in itself and lets the component know that the data has changed using reactredux connect function. So you can have your other component monitor the store. And when the data in the store changes it will get the new data and can react to it. So the other components either uses redux as the bool switch or has its own switch that it changes when it sees the props change the props are populated by mapStateToProps in connect.,reactjs,dc5ocve,3,t5_2zldd
10273631,0,t3_5n4035,Well the store is basically a JS object somewhere and theres nothing stoping you for using it to allow for  applications to communicate as long as both are loaded on the same page etc.But that can lead to a lot of edge cases when one app changes the state of the other app and brings confusion.

10784258,0,t3_5u93ak,Theres several factors hereFirst much of the discussion in that issue came from relatively early in Reduxs usage.  As Dan mentions late in the thread the current advice is to connect as many components as you feel appropriate.  The Redux FAQ discusses that further at  .Second the wrapper components generated by connect actually implement shouldComponentUpdate themselves.  So even if a component higher in the tree rerenders the connected components will usually see that nothing has changed and shortcircuit the rerender process.  Theres tentative plans to actually remove the automatic implementation of shouldComponentUpdate because it interferes with other uses of Reacts context and ReactRedux v is more efficient about handling updates anyway so it probably isnt needed now.Third Im actually kind of confused about what youre asking in regards to pure components.  Why are you saying that its impossible to use pure components and lose the ability to use pure rendering on any component except leaves?,reactjs,ddsbg32,2,t5_2zldd

10852866,0,t1_ddyze7d,I hope Im understanding you correctly and Im just making a conjecture here but as actions are dispatched in a thunk they modify the state of the app. Components connected to props that are modified would trigger a rerender. For example say my thunk fetches data and I have a waitingForData prop that updates when the fetch is made. Thats one render and I have more renders coming depending on success or failure of the fetch. I would assume thats what is implied with dispatches causing rerenders.,reactjs,ddze9za,1,t5_2zldd
10866024,0,t1_ddzrytx,reactdomstream looks great. I think this is definitely worth trying. Thanks for the suggestion. We are already using webp lazy load and HTTP will talk about in part . We are actually using some service workers too planning to soon integrate for other specific use cases also but service workers by definition dont change performance of first time load.,reactjs,de0r4kz,1,t5_2zldd
10867973,0,t3_5vaq9r,This doesnt strictly answer your question but I recently converted a couple of react projects from browserify to webpack . Something of a struggle as I wanted development and production builds with common libraries in separate dll bundles plus testing and code coverage. Eventually I ended up with the set of files herewebpack.base.js contains common definitions the other webpack files use this to do each of the bits along with appalltests.js and mochawebpack.opts for testing and coverage. Ive added the relevant script lines from package.json.This might be overkill but they do work for me anyway!,reactjs,de0yd30,2,t5_2zldd

11374877,0,t3_62ben6,Not courses specifically but I have a bunch of resources that may help.There was actually a great article published just today and actually still currently at the top of rreactjs Simple React Development in   Its not a React tutorial per se but explains how you can get up and running with a new React project in a matter of minutes to give you a place to start writing some code.Next I keep a big list of links to highquality tutorials and articles on React Redux and related topics at  . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics.  The front page of the repo has a bestof  guided learning list of links  just the top  articles for each of several important topics about React.To pick out a few of those links I recently gave an intro to React and Redux presentation and the slides are available online  This Learn Raw React post explains Reacts core concepts without dragging in any other technologies or terms  Heres a couple great articles that explain things like props and state    .Id encourage you to read through some of the other articles in the front page of my links list as well.Beyond that the article A Study Plan to Cure Javascript Fatigue    is a great place to start. It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time Javascript React ES and state management.On that note definitely dont overcomplicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a boilerplate to learn React and theyre wrong  boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured and are confusing for beginners.Instead the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful and you can learn about other tools later.You should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at  and Id encourage you to use the official CreateReactApp tool    for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup with no configuration needed on your part.Finally the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out ask questions and learn. The invite link is at  .Hope that helps!,reactjs,dflbmku,2,t5_2zldd

11530622,0,t3_64jk73,Im quite curious how but Id also like to ask how you mean that running node would somehow be more expensive than apache?If you mean that you didnt have to run an additional server you could even have run it on the same machine and just proxy pass whatever thats called in apache to it from apache. Inventing your own way to render react applications through apache somehow seems like it would be far more expensive than running a couple of extra instances.,reactjs,dg2zxv3,1,t5_2zldd

11722885,0,t3_679pcn,Well jSX is that latest syntax you are speaking of.For the basics with new syntax see this react js tutorial site.For this you need to make sure to include babel. But keep in mind this is not sufficient for real production environment build.React.createClass is ES while JSX is ES. You can even create functional stateless elements using JavaScript functions and interchange all of the  different methods without breaking React.One of the hardest things about React is trying to see the difference in how all these different ways of making things end up being turned into a React component regardless of how they were created.,reactjs,dgoti39,3,t5_2zldd
