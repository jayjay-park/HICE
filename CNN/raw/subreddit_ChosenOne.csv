If you measured the output with an analog oscilloscope you would see a perfect undistorted sine wave.The author of these pictures is making an incorrect assumption based on the display method of Audacity.See this Edit  this video shows the concept better than the first one ,ChosenOne,clbikgo,4,t5_2yhsl

7943315,0,t1_d48w1z8,My method is to save on dirty dishes. So take the stick of butter outta the fridge cut where it is marked  cup...put in mixing bowl and nuke for  seconds...soft but not liquid...then using the same bowl add egg and sugar.  I presift several cup batches of flour at a time and stick them in ziplock bags so when i want to make biscuits i just need to grab a bag of flour readytogo.  But you can only mix up half the flour with the milk baking soda etc because otherwise the mixture is too stiff...then fold in the rest of the flour.  I am going to make biscuits today because you are making me hungry.  I can post more pics if you want.,ChosenOne,d48wic5,2,t5_2yhsl
