11560029,0,t3_64wvt3,Ive had NT girlfriends since I was a teenager but Im really good at passing so theres that. I suppose why I have had reasonable success in that area is I talk to everyone. Like I make small talk in the elevator actively introduce myself to people and tell a funny story and seeing as most guys dont really do that and stick to their group women often like me for being that way and often not.So the advice is practice being good at small talk and talk to random people. Eventually a bunch of people will know who you are some of which women and you can go out and do stuff together. How I found a gf who accepted my AS traits a relationship is about adapting to one another. If she loves you and shes mature enough to accept that fact shell adapt to you if you adapt to her too. ,autismacceptance,dg6c0si,3,t5_3jyld
