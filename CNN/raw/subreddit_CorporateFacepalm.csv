If its really so easy to target a disinterested demographic without being offensive then please tell me how to do so.Not that I agree that there was anything inherently offensive about IBMs attempt.  Its not as though they said heres a hairdryer because this is the most complicated device that your tiny female brain can comprehend even though some people are obviously choosing to interpret it that way.  All they did was choose a device that most women own and many women take an interest in.  If thats off limits then what isnt?So lets have it.  Convince me  a straight white something man in a STEM field  that I should consider taking an interest in hairstyling.  What sort of educational video can you envision that will interest me enough to actually watch it through to the end but couldnt possibly be offensive by playing into any stereotypes or traditional gender roles?

Why ask me a question and then give me your answer immediately? That is not a conversation. That is arrogance and narcissism. Here is one link I found. says Hillary had a mole in Sanders CampaignI stumbled upon a bunch of other stories talking about how the DNC set him up to fail especially through DWS I believe that is her acronym. I dont quite remember who had personally made calls to change stories and influence media to sway the primaries. first oneanother one It cites a direct source from an email towards the end of the article. There are many more but I didnt include them. I simply google evidence Hillary cheated Bernie and this is what came up. They talk about similar things all together. And some have good points and some have bad ones but the evidence is quite clear it was not a leveled playing field. Now I can guess what youre thinking. It wasnt Clinton that did this. She didnt want this. It was done for her. She is not responsible. I would like to remind you that immediately following these events DWS was given a high paying position in the Clinton Campaign. I will not give you my personal opinion that would be hypocritical but I would like to note there are strong implications through this action. I would also like to remind you that this is the candidate that wanted to stay in the race again Obama in  in case of unforeseen circumstances suggesting Obama would be assassinated. I would also like to remind you that for a senator Hillary Clinton is known to have the least amount of progress done in way of sponsoring bills and passing laws compared to any other senator.  I have a video all about this. It is on my computer and I am on mobile  maybe I could send it your way later.

Also having the Orient still be called the Orient rather than Asia has pretty overt racist undertones. I mean its less offensive but calling a place anything but its name is pretty bad. The only place its still okay is calling the Middle East the Middle East and Im pretty sure thats because it would be a big cluster fuck trying to come up with any other name for the area given it spans ? continents.,CorporateFacepalm,dbaoomh,1,t5_38jqw

In the postPC era semicontroversial statements are great for advertising as they get posted far and wide like it has been here and its totally okay and normalised thanks to our esteemed leaders. There has been a lot of this lately and it seems to work particularly well on the youth. Im in my early twenties and the amount of advertisements like this being spammed on my news feed by my friends lately is obscene imo. Not because of the content but because advertisers have found a medium to get to the milleniums. Effective advertising is essentially a meme these days.

11212829,0,t1_df1yg7r,Audi is based in Germany and has no factories in America. In Germany both parents are legally entitled to parental leave so even if its a factor its not genderbiased. Their other locations are in Belgium Spain Hungary Slovakia China Russia India Indonesia and Italy Italy is Lamborghini only which is wholly owned by Audi. Parental leave rights vary between those countries but theyre all more progressive than in the United States because we flatout suck at it which is why companies consider it a benefit if they offer it.Various other factors that go into total pay which Audi is actually talking about. Hours worked including overtime which may be at the discretion of the employee. Position worked an accountant or HR rep does not get paid the same as a structural engineer. Experience. Location cost of living for companies with multiple locationsFor  men are more likely to be in positions that pay overtime hourly or contract instead of salaried and in areas that often have to be pushed harder like on the factory floor and  is obvious based on the gender bias in STEM fields. The only thing Audi can do about these is to hire women at roughly the same rate women apply to them as that would show no practice of gender bias in hiring. If fewer women are applying than men for higher paying jobs then theres not really anything they can do.When these  factors are accounted for to compare employees applestoapples the overall pay gap decreases to about . Not perfect but better. This remaining  is the corporate responsibility to rectify which Audi claims to have done within their company. Based on personal experience in the automotive and aerospace industries its probably accounted for by simply including salary ranges in the job posting to put a realistic window on negotiations and by tying the majority of pay increase values to team and company performance with only minor influence from individual performance.The extra  in the aggregate income gap is our responsibility and can be fixed by encouraging and supporting more women into pursuing STEM careers and many maledominated manual labor jobs whilst simultaneously encouraging and supporting more men into pursuing historically female dominated careers such as nursing or elementarylevel teaching.
