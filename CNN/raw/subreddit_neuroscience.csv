If I were being snarky Id just say we already understand how neurones work so were done at a modular level theres already quite a good understanding of synapsesynapse communication of cells and the roles that glial cells play but even here at the simple end theres a lot of work going on re receptors and their expression profile epigenetics and all sorts of things. Moving on from that theres huge amounts of work to be done in network dynamics the way that the frequency different neural networks fire and how that encodes information interpretation and a million other things to think about.What Im saying is noone can give you an answer to your question sorry.Edit To add to that I think that the whole futurist well just invent a brain thats smart enough to improve itself then were golden singularity here we come!! viewpoint is made up of  hope and conjecture  extraordinary claims like that need extraordinary evidence to support them and at the moment there just isnt any.

You are going to be bettersuited for neuroscience type programs that are under the umbrella of the Psych department than you are neuroscience programs that are under a Biology department. This does not mean you cannot do real neuroscience! I am in a behavioral neuroscience program and I basically do all of my work through the biology department it was just slightly easier for me to get in because I wasnt expected to have a strong biochem background. I pretty much never use physics or calculus but statistics is important youll have to take that in grad school anyway.If you want to pursue the other track biology department I would suggest basic biology chemistry and even an undergrad neuroscience course to help you bulk up your qualifications.

Then we tinker with that biological compound to make it more digestible etc. and make up a story about how it effects the brain and hope thats really whats going on.In reality we dont understand the full chain of events that leads from a drug binding to a receptor to whatever overt effect it causes. For example lithium is one of the main drugs prescribed for bipolar disorder. There is no good mechanistic explanation why this works but it does.We are woefully far away from being able to predict what a drug will do the human body.

5896678,0,t3_3w1ky6,tldr you dont need to preserve the full presynaptic cell just stimulate axon terminals expressing ChR.One convenient aspect about acute slices is that the cell bodies of the neurons you are trying to stimulate do not need to be present in the slice. So long as the axons of those cells are present you can stimulate them electrically if theyre in a fairly tight bundle or with an optogenetic protein like ChR if you want genetic specificity. You could try to preserve the cell bodies and all of the axons and stimulating the cell bodies would be more physiological than stimulating the axon terminals but in many cases its just not possible because of the geometry of the projections. I have stimulated dopamine axons in the mouse striatum and measured massive dopamine release with amperometryvoltammetry. I simply injected a virus encoding ChR into the substantia nigra pars compacta using a DATcre line for specificity waited about  weeks for sufficient ChR protein to reach the axon terminals then cut coronal slices through striatum. Ive also done this in mPFC where I saw no significant dopamine signal the dopamine axons are much sparser there than in the striatum. Optogenetic proteins have caveats though  they desensitize for example  so a good synaptic physiologist will take with a major grain of salt any data from optogenetic terminal stimulation. But if you dont care about measuring the short term dynamics of a particular synapse e.g. facilitation depression but rather changes after drug application or some other manipulation then its a great method.

The heart of my issue with your post is this None of what you describe here is in any way neuroscience.  I think that you are probably sincere in believing what you have written but that does not make your document part of a fruitful discussion on neuroscience.  You make sweeping claims that are frankly not scientific  there appears to be no way to recast most of your document into falsifiable hypotheses.  The problem is magnified however by your insistence on the use of nonstandard jargon that you have neither explained nor referenced.  One example is your use of the term quadrants.  I certainly have no idea what you mean by this and it seems truly extraordinary that this concept whatever you might mean by it would render neuroanatomical understanding in some way obsolete.  And this is the heart of a second layer of problems with this document  Not only is your post not within the subject matter of the subreddit as I see it the mods will decide it will not accomplish your own stated goal of wanting commentary on a draft.

10917978,0,t3_5vyq9b,Its so weird. Neuroscience is forever getting these debates where truth takes a backseat to what people think are social consequences of theories and therefore whether they should be rejected. That muddies the waters and ultimately hurts us IMO and things swing back and forth for no rational reason. If addiction involves effects of drugs on the brain then thats damn well the case. Understanding that doesnt mean we accept racism or social injustice. Also the original Leshner paper Addiction is a brain disease and it matters is very nuanced and goes into social aspects of drug problems   theyre inherently involved since what changes in the brain involves emotions and motivation and decisionmaking. Obviously addiction isnt like Huntingtons or Parkinsons in its etiology. gt As with many other brain diseases addiction has embedded behavioral and socialcontext aspects that are important parts of the disorder itself. Therefore the most effective treatment approaches will include biological behavioral and socialcontext components.The whole idea was to get away from the blame model.gt However the more common view is that drug addicts are weak or bad people unwilling to lead moral lives and to control their behavior and gratifications. To the contrary addiction is actually a chronic relapsing illness characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use . The gulf in implications between the bad person view and the chronic illness sufferer view is tremendous. As just one example there are many people who believe that addicted individuals do not even deserve treatment. This stigma and the underlying moralistic tone is a significant overlay on all decisions that relate to drug use and drug users,neuroscience,de6420i,12,t5_2r3cs
11125930,0,t1_deswnzg,I do still think you ring in on the optimistic side of the spectrume.g. the young bucks vastly outnumber the established researchers approaching retirement and this will become an issue soon. But you make a compelling argument. Thank you for sharing your time and knowledge. ,neuroscience,det453o,2,t5_2r3cs

11357920,0,t1_dfiku38,So the main issue is how much you can access? Is there a point in the brain where you can access everything? Eyesight hearing consciousness etc. Unless you can get it all through some form of scan I would think a BCI would have to hook in. ,neuroscience,dfjedze,1,t5_2r3cs
