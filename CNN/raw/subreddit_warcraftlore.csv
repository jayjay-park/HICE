1671881,0,t1_cjpwcnn,I always try to ignore timeframes when talking about population in warcraft since battlegrounds like Arathai Basin are suppose to have been going on for  yearsyet there has not been a massive drop in population nor a giant pile of bodies being built up. Ultimately the populations of both faction will be as big as they need to be to factoring in the respawning NPCs and all the new fronts that open up. That being saidgt Definitely not true for the First War nor was this true for Vanilla WoW through Mists of Pandaria. The Alliance was always outnumbered by the Horde.I based that on a manual I read when I first started WoW which was written by Blizzard that wrote about the strength and weaknesses of each faction. This would have come out during Vanilla days so  somewhere. After reading another post about the horde from the second war you could be right but I was only going off the manual I got.gt Thats just plain wrong Im sorry to say. The Night Elves started from trolls and were raised on a warrior culture. The WarriorPriestesses are a testimony to this. And you know what the first thing the Night Elves did when they saw the Horde enter Ashenvale? They ambushed them and started killing the orcs. Grom Hellscream called them savage. Let that sink in. Grom Hellscream called another race barbaric in combat.Its believed they descended form the Trolls but never confirmed. During the war of the ancients they had a terrible class system which pushed elves vs elves but after the war the Night Elves went into complete seclusion and let the other races humans and orcs run ramapge around the world and they chose to do nothing. They were a heavily dominate race in the world for a time period but chose to cut them selves off from it which they wouldnt do if they were truely interested in war.Given that the Orcs were cutting down the trees in ashenvale its completely understandable that the Night Elves attacked especially since some of those trees could have once been friends to them.I wouldnt say Grom is a very creidlble source to judge people on since a mission later he chose to drink the blood of mind drawing a blank  a pit lord just to win the fight against Cenarius. Of course he would call the night elves savages much like in Pocahontas both the Europeans and the Native Americans called each other savages in that one song. Its a completely different culture to him and he would probably also call the Dranei he helped nearly wipe out savage. Yet we know that they are a race that all very closely follow the light and only think holy thoughts.gt Nah that was just Anduins constant screaming for peace finally clicking with Varian for some reason. But seriously that was done for gameplay. Previously Varian was quite the antiHorde and wanted to kill all of them. There is literally no reason for him to spare the Horde.I think its ok for him to change his mind on wanting to wipe out the horde for more then just gameplay reasons. As time went on he learnt to respect Thrall and Voljin as honourable people. I agree it was a big change in opinion that the game required for the Horde to survive but given the Horde under Voljin will have lots of good traits I think it would be fair to give them a chance to prove themselves before killing them all.,warcraftlore,cjpwhwl,2,t5_2s5rg

For starters most priests are pacifistic in nature and are noncombative whereas Paladins are the martial hand of their respective religion. Paladins can come from the priesthood or from the warrior class.Most importantly how they wield the Light is fundamentally different. A priest simply calls forth and uses the Light like a tool.

If the Drakkari Trolls had been diplomatic to begin with they wouldve aligned with the Argent Crusade or the Zandalar during the war against the Lich King after all that and then the death of Malakk I cant imagine any races wanting to extend or accept the olive branch. What is left of the Drakkari isnt known what with ZulDrak being still in the WotLKperiod we cant tell what sort of toll the Scourge and the support given to the Thunder King has taken on them as a society I would assume two wars and their religious leaders as well as their King being dead would have created a power vaccum that would invariably lead to infighting and a powerstruggle and while a new leader may arise it would be doubtful they would command the same strength the Drakkari used to. In terms of how they got around to building said empire as with most empires the strong live in luxury and the beaten are reduced to a peasant class who are the farmers builders etc. And knowing Trolls there would have been plenty of tribes for the stronger Drakkari to subjugate.  ,warcraftlore,clvlzis,1,t5_2s5rg

2431932,0,t3_2n94wm,I see a lot of no but I believe the scourge had the capability to surpass any power since its literally the power of death and just about everything will die. The argument comes from the fact that the legion is depicted as a celestial body of pure evil. Like planet crushing space demons which goes beyond that of azeroth and the scourge couldnt even handle that then again the legion cant do much either. And old gods are depicted as beings that can corrupt anything the moreso the closer they get. However as TWotLK was depicted I feel like Arthas could have continued to tame anything and everything. The giants made by the titans themselves couldnt stop the giant abominations he created. And thats just it he could create life from deathhe was essentially a god. But we stopped him before he could reach his full potential. Just like we stop the legion before they can get their full power through any portal. Blizz likes to keep doors open by limiting the characters they work so hard for by saying that we dont face them at full which is sad because it only makes us feel like we never accomplished anything rather than making it seem bigger and badder when they bring em back...like ragnaros. But thats one thing to consider the heroes of azeroth are the strongest of the strong since we have unlimited potentialsomeday im sure well even take down sargeras but because of that reason you must consider that Arthas was able to kill and resurrect us. If we could inevitably defeat the burning legion technically Arthas could use us to do the same.Thats probably not the lore youre thinking of though but its just food for thought since the legion and old gods arent even really much more than spectulation. As for what we HAVE seen though Id say yes Arthas in WotLK could have taken Archimonde and any army he had. Again if we could he could.,warcraftlore,cmcal01,3,t5_2s5rg

2784675,0,t3_2ryav2,The old gods are assumed to be manipulating everything but their goals are odd. All of their plans inevitably lead to the burning legion returning and destroying azeroth. Make deathwing destroy all life created by the titans no one left to stop an invasion and the legion returns and destroys the planet after taking all the arcane magic. The legion doesnt want the life they want the well of eternity. So removing all the Titan based life forms inevitably leads to their own destruction. So I think this signals only one possibility. The old gods are not working for themselves. Sargeras was born within medhivh and his avatar walked on the planet. The legion cant find him which means hes not in the twisting nether nor somewhere the pantheon knows about. Hes still on azeroth. Doesnt it seem strange all the old gods are awaking so quickly for seemingly no reason? I think Sargeras who is somewhere in azeroth as a bodiless spirit is disrupting the prisons of the old gods. Purposely weakening them to exterminate all the Titan technology and life so the legion can walk into the planet. Then corrupt the world tree use its limitless power and resummon his body. Or abandon his body altogether and become an old god volton. Use their curse of flesh to destroy the pantheon and win his ultimate victory. The heroes of the light and pantheon stop him hes not returned to his full power but enough to crack the planet.

Here player named Baluin states The Sunreavers had been given every opportunity to prove that they were more loyal to the Kirin Tor and the ideal of peace than to the Horde or to Garrosh. Jaina even ignoresdismisses the complaints of her advisers and the player character that the Sunreavers cant be trusted instead she insists she must be fair and kind in order to have any hope of peace.And then the Sunreavers just let Garroshs forces waltz right through Dalaran and use ALLIANCE AND KIRIN TOR PORTALS to get to Darnassus and steal ANOTHER WMD. When confronted about this the Sunreavers dont even attempt to apologize or claim innocence you just stand there smugly like Yeah we did it. What ya gonna do about it? So when she decides to tell you GTFO of Dalaran and you have the gall to resist and ask Why? she is well within her rights as the leader of the Kirin Tor to have the Sunreavers forcibly evicted. And unlike ithe Hordei she doesnt order anyone slaughtered or killed senselessly she orders any one who surrenders or doesnt resist to be taken prisoner and held until there is a suitable way to release them that ensures they cant hurt the Kirin Tor or Alliance anymore. The only Sunreavers who die are the ones who resist or try to lead others farther into Dalaran to form an insurgency. I completly agree with him.,warcraftlore,cohzskl,18,t5_2s5rg

Obviously their forms would be plagued animals.I would make the case that there is already a much more interesting precedent for Forsaken druids to follow and it comes in the form of the satyrIngame some satyr can be seen using druidlike spells Alzzin the Wildshaper in Dire Maul is a fantastic example. It appears that the satyr can do things druids do but not right off the bat for obvious reasons. Beforehand the satyr must corrupt and  pervert the natural world around them into something they can manipulate  and thats a key point their brand of druidism is manipulative its the druidic answer to dark shamanism.Its suggested the blood elves do something similar too Quelthalas is saturated with magic and as such the elves can use this magic to manipulate the natural world. A fine example are the treant tenders and lynxes on Sunstrider Isle  the player is tasked with culling them because its admittedly implied the elves can no longer control them with their magic.The Cenarion Circle can jive with the harvestwitches just fine but I think itd be much more interesting to introduce a form of druidism that is very much atodds with everybody else.,warcraftlore,cp1swij,1,t5_2s5rg

5205947,0,t1_cvcyscn,In Warcraft terms corporeal undeath is a state in which a body is reanimated but not biologically functional on most levels. Decay is often but not always postponed but the heart does not beat the stomach does not growl in hunger the flesh does not feel most sensation though this last part varies depending on the state of decomposition. Mindless beings such as Scourge grunt forces ghouls zombies have little more than instinct and are thus puppeteered. Sylvanas soul was active outside of her body and twisted into a Banshee. Later she possessed her own body like a dead elf meat suit. The Forsaken are mostly Lorderon human deceased. These are souls that inhabit their own dead bodies similar to Sylvanas.Resurrection is the restoration of the body to its living state. A revived being goes about business as usual in the biological sense the heart beats the body withers if malnourished and the flesh retains its ability to experience sensation.,warcraftlore,cvdicgd,3,t5_2s5rg

5375415,0,t1_cvy9og0,Hi! Well of course I dont actually know. But these approximations were produced by making a number of inferences and measurements.To determine how much land is undiscovered on Azeroth I did the following Established that for lifephysicschemistry of Azeroth to be similar to Earth that the planets had to be of comparative size which includes the necessary waterland ratio. Provided the total square mileage of land on Earth Subtracted the estimated square mileage from my measurements of Azeroth which were in all cases rounded upBy measuring the approximate square mileage of land I deduced that it only accounts for  of Earth. This of course assumes a number of things  a nitrogenrich atmosphere with a similar O ratio to Earths atmosphere too much oxygen and fire would behave differently for example. Not enough and campfires would be impossible assume Azeroth has a comparable size to Earth due to the behavior of water humanoid interactions with gravity plant growth and of course the assumption of copious cyanobacteria in comparable numbers going back to the previous point about oxygen levels Blizzard does not wave the retcon wand later down the line and fix the wonky travel distances supplied by various authors that seem to contradict one anotherAgain note that all measurements were taken from canon lore sources meaning they are the gospel truth of Warcraft.Really though I am doing nothing more than piecing together tidbits that dont properly match to determine something as intangible as how many angels fit on the head of a pin for our mutual entertainment. In my more liberal approximations I determined that the known lands of Azeroth could be as much as  of all land.The nail in the coffin is the presence of Humans. Our species has many fields of hard science and social science that can prove our environmental limitations and thus we can infer a lot from that.On the note of gravity it has been well documented that humans that spend notable amounts of time in reduced gravity suffer spinal pain from compression upon return as well as muscular atrophe. We can look at a public setting in a photograph and approximate temperature by looking at the clothing people wear within a few degrees. Chemistry is a huge act of betrayal against most rebuttals to planetary size as well. Oxidation rust is prevalent in Warcraft indicating the presence of bonding between Iron and Oxygen due to moisture. Minerals fire and a variety of generally analogous life all have volumes of research and study to fill whole libraries. And from these overwhelming accounts there mere presence of a tree and a human being indigenous to Azeroth proves the fictional planet must be nearly identical to Earth.Until Blizzard states otherwise. And that explanation will most likely be a more formalized rebuttal that basically states nuh uh because magic if they ever decide to do so.So to sum it up because the measurements and scientific precedent determine it is so.  ,warcraftlore,cvyrqha,1,t5_2s5rg

First he leaps onto the conference table well get on his back and begin ripping his armor away! He stabs Frostmourne into the table and hops down.and then we will send him to the maelstrom.

Personally I prefer the whole their species can just grow old AF without worrying about mortality. With a game full of as much magic as it is I wish more attention would be paid to individual races that weve had awhile rather than continuously showing us things like the HozenJinyu and the various races on Draenor with the exception of the birds...that needed to be there.I just long for a day where the Worgen Draenei Blood Elves Goblins Dwarves etc get their expansion in the sun cause honestly Im tired of Orcs and Humans.

Naralex was foolish but wellintentioned. Fandral was also stronger if that influences things based on your card stats.Mage If you want someone extremely powerful to go with high card stats then Aegwynn is a good idea. In the next WoW expansion arcane mages will be aided by echos of Aegwynn when in combat. Two weaker characters  who are both dungeon bosses so maybe slightly better known than Brawlers guild bosses  that deal with creating copies of themselves are Grand Magus Telestra splits into  and Jandice Barov splits into a lot.Paladin have to echo others suggestion for Turalyon. Has very fitting lore.Rogue Lord Godfrey kidnapped his king while he was human and later became undead and continued to be treacherous. He isnt a traditional rogue in that he uses dual pistols instead of daggers but otherwise he fits well from a story perspective. Otherwise normal undead rogues tend to be called Deathstalkers so maybe there is a named Deathstalker NPC in the game who is involved in a kidnapping but I cant think of one off the top of my head.Shaman What you describe would not tend to be done by most shaman as they tend to try to work with elements and ancestors instead of controlling them but Dark Shaman Haromm and Kardris may be somewhat suitable.Warlock depending on what type of profit you are talking about Terongor and Evol Fingers as others have suggested would both be suitable.

Mannoroth is a particularly powerful dreadlord and is considered to be a lieutenant probably the closest to someone who ranks directly below KilJaedan and Archimmonde that we know of. KilJaedan and Archimonde are also probably a bit of a toss up. They are Sargeras left and right hand guys and they seem to be competing with each other for more power and to eventually have more power than Sargeras himself. Thats pretty much how the hierarchy of the Legion works whos the most powerful? They all work together to sew chaos and destruction but theyre end goal is more power. And not for everyone but only for themselves as individuals. Formal ranks are hard to determine. If you want to gauge the general strength of a demon you could look at their race.. Eredar. Nathrezim. Pit LordAnd so on. at a certain point determining power levels becomes difficult as there are varying examples of one Pitlord being stronger than a Eredar. Though as a general rule intelligence and power with magic is the strongest trait of a demon. Followed by actual size and physical strength or martial prowess. Once you get down into the grunts they are pretty much mindless beasts who will take orders from any demon strong enough to control them to a degree. ,warcraftlore,cyycz32,5,t5_2s5rg

Likely the solid excrement is devoured by these pigs along with other nonfeces based waste whom are then eaten by Orcs on the lower ends of society read peons Zug Zug. This sort of thing has been and is still is in places a very important part of our real life relationship with swine The closest human parallel to the Tauren citizens at Thunderbluff would be Native American Cliff Dwellers such as the citizens of Mesa Verde.

6419642,0,t1_czj18xk,I find it interesting that both male dragons Chronormu and Andorgos have chosen to disguise themselves as female gnomes.  There are a lot of things that spring out at me here Andorgos and androgynous share a lot of letters. They both have a choice to disguise themselves as anything and picked the opposite gender and the smallest humanoid form they could muster while still accomplishing their missions  Going from male to female and from gigantic to miniscule.   This leads me to believe perhaps its an injoke or reference about the choices humans make when they get to decide their characters race and gender  and how so many people choose somethingact completely the opposite of how they do in real life.  A statement on the freedom of semianonymity perhaps? Some NPC developmentdesign person has been quietly watching for years waiting for someone to notice this.

6816389,0,t1_d0otsrl,gt Hadnt we get that deus ex machina from Malfurion for the sake of the storys continuity he wouldve won.I am  years younger than Archimonde and I could see holes in his plan. The real Deus ex Machina here was Archimonde going all in on an attack on the World Tree even though his own forces knew mortals were amassing and uniting on Kalimdor.Allin is not a winners strategy. Its sloppy and its amateur. Something no military commander with the most rudimentary of training would employ much less a eonsold superbeing.The Battle for Mount Hyjal was silly.Let us compare the devastation of the Legion between Draenor and AzerothDraenor Subverted a leader Nerzhul   Corrupted a race Orcs   Nearly exterminated the targeted Draenei.   Army created   Superweapon created Lich King   Planet Destroyed by subverted race  Tally Azeroth Initial invasion thwarted   Well DestroyedSundering   Second Invasion thwarted   Kiljaeden attempt thwarted  Army created scourge   Army lost  Superweapon from Draenor lost Lich King  Superweapon created Medhiv   Superweapon lost off with his head!  Powerful agent lost Guldan  Army from Draenor lost  Enemy Superweapon temporarily disabled Cenarius  Tally Azeroth is filled with comparatively clever beings that seem to overcome all odds. There is a reason the United States allocates billions of dollars on noncombat military expenditures. Imagery spy networks armor strategic positioning...it all adds up. The Iraq War and the decade following showed a result to drive this point home Less than  American deaths. Over  Iraqi deaths. The invading forces produced a count of .  And its not just a factor of caring about troops. Any squad leader knows that more survivors means fastereffective. phase transitions. If Archimonde had knocked down the World Tree...what then? his forces were destroyed. He would have to begin from the ground up.A popular counter to this might be who cares hes immortal. Sure but failure sucks. Maybe Sargeras cannotdoes punish him but having to summon littlebylittle he would eventually have to contend with. Its a lot of unnecessary work! Send spies. Infiltrate. Report. Spread. The Legions communications network is terrible!Now look at AU Draenor and how easily the plan went to shit for the Legion.Mannoroth is largely refused. Gets killed. Archimonde himself has to come to deal with the colosal fuckup that resulted. Eventually the rebellious orcs are quelled but oh my god those damned Azeroth turds are here!Archimonde and Kiljaeden oh yeah and Mannoroth knew about Azeroth for ten thousand years and still managed to fudge things up. Why did they not go for the Tomb of Sargeras? Why not recruit more thoroughly?Instead Archimonde decided to play Quidditch and damn the torpedoes. LOL Im Seeker he probably thought to himself as he charged the World Tree imma topple the Golden Snitch!Since this went way long I have dropped a faux summary for your amusement.TLDR When House Legiondore challenged House Azerotheryn to a rematch Archimotter ditched the team strategy to rush the Golden Snitch Tree.

The Lords are not forces of nature which came into being with a set purpose they are very aware sentient beings. It just happens that Ragnaros is a bully that wants to beat the crap out of the other Elemental Lords and take their lands and the latter despise him for that they think of him as a tyrant.The Elemental Lords well Ragnaros and Alakir mostly just want to conquer lands. So they do. Ragnaros happens to do it using fire since... hes made of fire.

I know its controversial and Blizzard isnt keen to provide figures but I did a little experiment.Assuming an average walking speed of  miles per hour I decided to see how far Id get in  minutes.  From the centre of the Bazaar in Silvermoon City it takes just under  minutes to walk by road from there to Tranquilien so  thats about one mile.Then I tried something else.Running is x walking speed and a basic mount is twice that so youre riding at mph on a  mount.  Thats a mile in . minutes.  It takes exactly that amount of time to ride down the Dead Scar from the edge of the Ruins of Silvermoon to the gates of Deatholme. Exactly a mile. Unlike the road to Tranquilien the Dead Scar is pretty much straight.So then I took a map of the Eastern Kingdoms and using the length of the Dead Scar as my scale reference I measured the length and width at the widest point.  Not including the Isle of Queldanas because I forgot to include it the entire Eastern Kingdoms continent is approximately . miles by ..No wonder Blizzard wants to keep quiet about it.,warcraftlore,d0wlsf1,3,t5_2s5rg

There are several occurences of people being withheld in our reality be it by being cursed or by having so much faith in the Light as you said that they become ghosts or whatever a bit unclear. I think the hell Sylvanas wouldve faced is linked to her Banshee state the curse of the Lich King. I dont think its another dimension but just her suffering for ever in the Shadowlands. the pact thingy  I was specifically referring to Nerzhuls pact with a demon Kiljaeden. He failed his part so he got his soul tortured for what he felt like eternities and ended up imprisoned for eons in an ice block. But there are other examples of such pacts Guldan Illidan...

7415294,0,t3_4gv0ew,You have a lot of options to be honest. Legion puts a big emphasis on class identity and story so most classes are getting a lot of lore and thematic additions. But if you really want something that works best for the theme of the expansion Paladins Dreanei or Human are a big player against the Legion and take a role similar to protectors. Of the classes so far they seem one of the most proactive in fighting the Legion and their class Nemesis is Balnazzar who has been appointed the official leader of the Dreadlords and is noted as one of the leaders of the expansionspoiler.  Demon Hunters Blood Elf Id say is better since lorewise there are more of them. You cant actually play these yet but they are very thematically tied to the expansion. There is a lot of class fantasy being pushed since they are brand new.  Death Knights particularly Frost any race that you think fits. Not tied to the themes of Legion directly but if you like ScourgeUndead lore they are really getting some good stuff. Warlocks any race. While most classes are directly trying to defend Azeroth warlocks overstep and overestimate their powers which is a really interesting theme. There is a lot of lore relating to the council of the black harvest and a little with the shadow council. Worgen Balance druids is a really interesting pick as the artifact weapon is the Scythe of Elune the thing that the worgen curse is tied toospoilers. ,warcraftlore,d2l2k4h,4,t5_2s5rg

Then she beat him but he got the idea of slipping into her body right before losing. Or perhaps he meant to slip into her body before the start of the fight cant remember but theres nothing saying that his goal when arriving was to get inside the Guardian.

When Medhiv was killed Sargeras spirit was banished to the Nether. We dont know its current whereabouts.

Now IIRC hes trying to put Sargeras spirit into Illidans body but Im not sure. Also it looks like hes been given a lot of power as during the Mythic phase of the fight against him he undergoes a super fiery transformation and gains horns a mane of fire  la Sargeras and his skin becomes yellowredish.

Continuing this theme Shadowpriests motivations are generally the opposite of the Light.  They work for selfish reasons such as to manipulate others or to further their own survival. However like the Light it requires some conviction also you need the strength of will to dominate others and faith in your own abilities.  You respect others in power but always work to overcome them because you survival is the most important.

7884787,0,t1_d428194,gtOk maybe OP wasnt the correct term. But they are still very formidable. If they wanted to go wild then it would take almost everybody else combined to take them out.I dont doubt that they are formidable but I see no reason for you to believe it would take almost everybody else combined to take them out unless of course youre talking about them deploying chemical weapons but even if they managed to strike some crucial targets with the plague it is highly unlikely they could win a war off that alone.gtSure they are physically weaker but much more resilient. Alliance fighters are still just mostly mortal creatures. You cut off a limb and they bleed to death. They need sustenance and rest you can wear them down.I dont disagree that they are resilient indeed I stated the pros you listed applied. Thats my point. The Forsaken have their pros but they also have their cons  it would be near impossible for a regular Deathguard to beat a regular Footman in  combat but in a drawn out conflict it is possible that the Forsaken would be able to endure high amounts of strain for longer than the mortals although I do regularly have trouble finding evidence that they do not tire as so many people seem to claim. gtThat is a very big assumption and your runofthemill Valkr are very different from the ones with Sylvanas. They are much more powerful.What evidence have we ever been given to suggest this?gtAnd you assume that anybody would get close enough to take them out. There is no reason to send them to battle they would stay with Sylvanas.So in a pitched battle they are allbut useless. If Sylvanas amp her company of Valkyr decide to move into the battlefield to try and resurrect the dead the Alliance forces have a single key group of targets which they could dispatch and win the war with ease. That is far too much of a risk for any sane commander to take therefore Sylvanas wont just stroll into the battlefield. Even if she decides to try and use them to prowl the battlefield afterwards its not as if the Alliance couldnt just use covert or guerrilla methods to dispatch the Valkyr knowing exactly where theyll be.gtThere are also lesser Valkr who can raise normal Forsaken. The reason they dont is politics. The rest of the Horde would look down on this. But in a war? They would raise everyone they could.Thats not true we know that she has very few Valkyr left in her service. Even her legion synopsis states all that stand between her and this doom are her Valkyr yet few of these spirit guardians remain. Also Im pretty sure the Valkyr have been actively raising fresh forsaken throughout Cataclysm and beyond despite Garroshs protests but feel free to correct me on that since Im not  certain.gtEDIT Typing on a phone sucks.I can imagine Valkyr is horrible to type out on a phone c,warcraftlore,d42bmuv,0,t5_2s5rg

I never stated that they are immune but its very clear that they dont just fall apart when they come into contact with it.Except one of the core aspects of the Scourge is that the light is an antithetical power to their own. The Forsaken are in no way physically different to the Scourge forces. We also know that the light rends through the undead of the scourge with great effect. If you accept these two premises and it is virtually impossible to argue they are false then there is no way you can argue the light would not be highly effective against the Forsaken if used against them.,warcraftlore,d42tfze,1,t5_2s5rg

8797094,0,t3_50lfg0,Rogue Warrior and Hunter are the weakest ones.Rogue makes sense except for the fact that everyone refers to you as Shadow in game because youre a member of a group known as the Shadows. Shadowblade just sounds like its trying to be edgy though. Skylord made a lot more sense for Warriors given where the class hall is but they dont exactly have any lore to pull on for a better name. Battlemaster might have worked better.Hunter should be Ranger Lord or something similar that denotes that the two RangerGenerals are your subordinates. Unfortunately General is the highest military rank around so youd have to move to noble titles to oneup a RangerGeneral.On to the rest...Death Knights should ideally be Highlord  la Darion Mograine but Paladins get preference on that I guess. I think Darion styled himself as Tirions counterpart to a degree given his past with the Ashbringer. Overlord maybe? Deathlord makes sense though as an alternative to Highlord.High Priest is just lazy. Cardinal Bishop anything with a vaguely Christian feel to it given how the Church of the Light seems to be based on Christianity in its styling.Same with Slayer for Demon Hunter. That sounds like a PVP title for getting  HKs or something not the title bestowed on the leader of the Illidari.Archdruid is rooted hehe in lore so thats fine. Same with Shaman Mage and Monk. All good there no complaints.Warlock... Well... Its the sort of thing youd expect a Warlock masters of ego to name themselves. It works even if its a bit cheesy.Theres some good ones,warcraftlore,d75ah6a,2,t5_2s5rg

9875552,0,t1_daunr0y,Sorry but no most of what you say here is nonsense. The Night Elves would never pick a side... ever. The humans cut lumber for war this is a desecration of nature.Hyjals alliance happened because it was the last hope. Medivh had to bring everyone together. However the war between the Alliance and Horde was none of the Night Elves business. They exist to bring order to the natural world. The fact that Tyrande is a faction leader is proof that this is pure nonsense. Even if they did pick a side would they really side with the alliance? The Horde has the Tauren a druidic race much like the Night Elves and it would benefit them greatly to be part of the horde rather than the Alliance. The spiritual shaman of the Horde would have also benefited them.They had literally no reason to join the Alliance. Period.The forsaken were a very small army that would have been defeated has the alliance and horde teamed up on them... if the scourge joined in... yep theyre pretty much gone. The forsaken could never hope to join the Horde because of the Hordes past experience working together with unholy forces.You cant have an undead faction and expect everybody to instantly  like you. The undead are a descecration of nature and their existence is contradictory to both the Tauren and the Orcish laws and values. The orcs should have slain all of the forsaken on sight. All these forsaken players who think that theyre so powerful have never played Warcraft  if they did they would realize just how weak their forces are Sylvanas had nothing but banshees and ghouls and was forced to use mercenaries in many of her fights many of those units were slain. Balnazzar was only defeated because the humans aided the forsaken in their attack. Sylvanas never had the ability to raise the dead armies until the Valkyr joined her she even says to Garrosh that her army is too weak and the needs the Valkyr to bolster her forces and Garrosh rightfully shuns her for it.The silly thing is Sylvanas was never really completely loyal to the horde she used the horde to serve her own ends. Now they make her Warchief. So now the horde is just part of the forsaken army as far as Sylvanas is concerned. The fact that this has happened is quite frankly hilarious.I want you to write to me a well written piece of lore that connects every single race to each faction horde and alliance because I want a good laugh. It is stupid to expect the Night Elves and the Forsaken to be part of these factions. They are independant factions in Warcraft  and it should have stayed that way.And no WOW is now all about good guys and bad guys the Alliance and Horde very rarely clash now and they band together against the evils of the world most of the time. Why is this the case? Because its an MMORPG. Had they kept it as an RTS they would continue to clash and the other races would remain independent from the Alliance and Horde.Claiming that the dragon aspects help out doesnt make a single difference to me they would still never pick a side because they are the guardians of Azeroth much like the Night Elves. Im sorry but your arguments carry no value to them. My point still stands.,warcraftlore,daut2ve,-11,t5_2s5rg

10067897,0,t3_5jy83s,Ive been playing Hearthstone before getting into WoW and you can imagine how surprised I was when I first saw Gallywixs model in game. This is the art used for him in Hearthstone. Getting him a unique model and some more spotlight would definitely be nice. A person that loves wealth power and fame so much would try to push themselves into any opportunity but despite being one of Hordes leaders he hasnt really ever done anything. Hes also much different from Hordes other leaders  theyre all proud but in a way selfless. They care for their people first and foremost. Gallywix cares for his personal gain and nothing else.Hes also very easy to get rid of. With how he seems to be he could probably bomb Orgrimmar if it just brings him profit. So its very easy to have him do something aweful and become a villain we kill.With how little he had done so far hes also an opportunity. Blizzard could do anything with his story. Does he care for the Horde at all? Does he have any sense of honor? Does he care for the good of other Goblins? Is he competent? Whats his moral compass? Blizzard could shape him anyway they want. Of course some possibilities I mentioned here would make the other things I mentioned above no longer true.EDIT At the same time I feel I should say that personally Id prefer they do some work on LorThemar instead. Of course if they did both itd be even better!,warcraftlore,dbjvbwa,28,t5_2s5rg
10199396,0,t3_5ls64j,Werent there already Blood Elves living in Azeroth already though and had either been sent back from Outland or never went there? Or was that a Retcon?  Either way I too thought that the Forsaken worked better in a third faction. In fact if you was going to do a third faction I would base it around a Forsake and Blood Elf alliance hell maybe even including Illidan. I feel like a faction like that could work quite well a group comprised of people who were forsaken or fallen far from the lofty heights they once held at once against the Legion and Scourge yet mistrusted and despised by the Alliance and Horde.  You could even add the Worgen of Gilneas.  On the other side I would include the Forest Trolls of ZulAman into the Horde as that would then give them a hold in Lordaeron.  Youd then have all three factions Alliance Horde and forsakenBE fighting against the Scourge while at the same time coming into conflict with each other in their bid for settling the land and taking Lordaeron.,warcraftlore,dc05pqq,1,t5_2s5rg

Feel free to correct me if Im wrong and there is one earlier.   Ragnaros grows legs and you have to fight him at full strength in Firelands in the Heroic only phase of the fight. Sha of Fear in Terrace of Endless Springs has a heroic only phase. Garrosh has the HeroicMythic only phase where you go into his fever dream where he wins in a destroyed shatainted Stormwind harbor where you can see the bodies of the various faction leaders impaled on the wall. Mythic Imperator Margoks final phase begins with Chogall appearing and killing Imperator at which point you fight Chogall himself. Mythic Archimondes new phase drags you into the Twisting Nether where you fight and kill him. Mythic Guldans extra phase is still mostly an unknown.

It would have done much more damage than the first one and some cities definitely would have been leveled most of the planet would be scarred but not completely destroyed.  If Suramar was lucky enough to avoid a direct hit something like the Broken Isles sinking into the sea or something like that it is entirely possible that they would have come through it with little to no damage especially with their strong defenses.  However the main point of the second shattering was to free the old gods and bring about the hour of twilight thus ushering in the rebirth of the black empire.
