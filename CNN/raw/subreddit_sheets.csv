10168634,0,t1_dbwhl9g,This is a very interesting problem. Essentially the googlefinance functions you are using in the script dont load before the script runs. So the formula automatically defaults to BUY You can see them all set to BUY the second you open the spreadsheet before the function loads. I am trying to see if theres a way to have those functions load before the script runs but havent found anything yet.,sheets,dbwo5ex,1,t5_35vj4
