6412831,0,t1_czifqe0,People dont respects the combo as much when any removal spell stops it. Kiki is so fragile...Also tempo no longer matters when youre activating colonnade. The idea is that you both traded resources until you were in top deck mode. A fairly resilient  is incredibly valuable in that situation enough such that its worth taking a turn off an untapped source. You can often play around the tapped source by turn . ,ModernURx,czikocp,2,t5_3c15j

6968262,0,t1_d166bt2,Yeah I think itd play more as a beatdown deck with a combo plan b considering the number of beaters but unless we get some good investigate cards that may be the best way to go if youre really hung up on playing Shape Anew. I would probably just go for a more traditional UWR midrange deck with a kikiresto combo as you free up some slots for cards like Lightning Helix.,ModernURx,d166sx2,1,t5_3c15j
7940100,0,t3_4nybhj,I play  serum visions for card selection. I also play  remand  electrolyze and  cryptic command to draw cards. I play a loothouse and  ancestral vision in the sideboard. Sphinx rev could work but is really slow as well. I think i prefer my ancestral vision.,ModernURx,d48ji8z,1,t5_3c15j
