1216667,0,t1_ci4foqi,The fact of the matter is that they did the work while they were employed by Cardiff and a judge might have a hard time believing that such a big project would happen without the companys approval. Cardiff could try to argue that they went rogue and the company had nothing to do with it but either way theyre going to face a legal challenge so they decide  with some strong nudging by Joe  to take the course of action that could actually pay off instead of just trying to keep IBM from suing their ass off.I agree that it still seems a bit farfetched particularly since they cram it all in that one episode.,HaltAndCatchFire,ci6hrww,1,t5_2vnu3

Halt and Catch Fire had a good beginning with season one I thought theyd pick up the pace and get into some great nitty gritty this year.  Alas  its way slower and far more a soap opera based in a pseudo tech world and less a tech based show with good drama.  Theyre also WAY off with some of their tech which in   with so many folks being technically savvy is not excusable.   ,HaltAndCatchFire,csu6b4z,3,t5_2vnu3

They had weeks to make a decision...,HaltAndCatchFire,d85lid5,11,t5_2vnu3
9103713,0,t1_d85w2dh,Exactly. Its entirely possible for him to both think Cameron being ousted is wrong amp wanting to look out for her because of his personal history getting dicked over in business  while also personally deciding that he cant deal with the relationship repercussions if he sided against his wife. If anything that just shows a very real internal conflict and is quite good writing. Remember how earlier in the episode Tom Rendon says something about We decided that mixing relationships with work is a bad idea. Definite foreshadowing. ,HaltAndCatchFire,d864c27,9,t5_2vnu3

9576323,0,t1_d9tckow,I dont know that she necessarily matured as much as was just defeated.She never let go of her feminist punk rock attitude but she did begin to understand she would have to compromise to create the things she really wanted.  In the end she felt betrayed as she was ousted from Mutiny.  At the start of the conflict she was the one seen as unreasonable wanting to maintain control and put off going public while she was given time to improve and grow.  Donna in all honesty saw Dianes lifestyle and desperately wanted to be just like her despite the need for antidepressants and mood equalizers and a broken family life.  Donna saw a successful IPO as the springboard to this.  Unfortunately the general public didnt get ita nd it turned out that Cameron may have been right but it was too late and Mutiny was dead upon the offering.  Fast forward  years Cameron is living in Japan and some assume she changed her look and dress to assimilate and be respectful of the culture in Japan but Cameron really had not been one to conform to any culture or standards.  I think it had more to do at that poing with her being broken by what she saw as a betrayal and then loss of her life and Tom taking advantage of it as she eventually took his name and was obviously dressed to present and impress herself to his peers and bosses he may not have been consciencely doing this at first.  By the time they get to the last two episodes he was jealous its fair to say rightfully so untrusting and a bit controlling.  He wasnt the same Tom that we saw in season .,HaltAndCatchFire,d9th6yy,5,t5_2vnu3
