3092541,0,t3_2se6wk,When were you hoping to leave? Depending on what the timeframe of this is I can express interest on behalf of at least one but likely two young men who are available this summerlate spring. We dont have a great deal of sailing experience particularly for longer trips but I do dinghy racing on my college team and have occasionally sailed larger vessels. I wont speak to my friends experience as I dont want to leave anything out but I can get in touch with him if the timing will work out. Id say we both have a basic understanding of sail and although were a little unfamiliar with larger boats and navigation we have an interest and willingness to learn and the ability to follow instructions.,sailingcrew,coijgw1,1,t5_2rpyh
4681182,0,t1_ctklcte,Trying to decide currently..... Cant sail down the ICW and wouldnt make any ground against the gulfstream really so I am contemplating trailering it down to the Lauderdale area or possibly just waiting out a few more weeks and taking the boat straight across to Freeport and then working my way south from there. Like I said no real set destination just looking to learn explore and have some fun along the way. The main reason I am doing this is to rid my life of rigorous schedules for a time and reset a bit.,sailingcrew,ctklymo,1,t5_2rpyh
