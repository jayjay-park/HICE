93420,0,t3_1v621q,Ive been water only for over a year. Compared to some others who have used products like baking soda and such my transitional period was long like  months. It wasnt anything awful maybe  weeks out of it was really bad like I have to wear a hat at all times bad but now my hair is just lovely and perfect all the time. I shower about  times a week and just scrub my scalp with my fingernails and that is it. I occasionally use a scented product if I really want my hair smelling nice for some reason usually rose water.,NoPoo,cep2dph,2,t5_2sej3
215583,0,t3_1wkr7k,I would think that the baking soda would be more of a culprit than the ACV. That being said my ends are looking rough lately too and Im  months in.  I think the missing component for me is a deep conditioner because I have no idea wont make my hair terrible.  How often do you use baking soda? Maybe try bentonite clay which can also be drying so probably only use once a week. Ive tried it a couple times mixed with aloe vera gel.  Definitely clears the oil but Im not sure if its causing more dryness yet.,NoPoo,cf2zzko,1,t5_2sej3

1745202,0,t3_2eff1e,I have very fine hair too and will hopefully be starting nopoo within the next week. After doing a lot of research for how to do nopoo with fine hair I figured the best way for me to start would be with a shampoo bar and a boar bristle brush. I ordered both online and hopefully theyll be here this week. I picked a shampoo bar because I already have quite oily hair and the boar bristle brush to help disburse the oil down the hair rather than it accumulating on top. I dont know if youve tried either but it may be worth it.  Unfortunately I cant tell you from experience yet whether it worked for me or not.

To improve your ends you need to actively condition or treat them not just reduce shampoo damage.

2298344,0,t3_2ll35j,Correct me if I am wrong but it doesnt sound like a dry scalp.I will imply you have dandruff too when you talk about your dry scalp.There are basically  kinds of dandruff which are commonThe dry scalp dandruff it comes from overshampooing your hair. If it gets worse after  days of not shampooing it is most likely not a dry scalp unless your scalp doesnt produce any sebum at all. But you are saying your hair looks better after some days so you produce sebum. The sebum is the best thing against a dry scalp. What you probably have is oily dandruff your scalp is over producing sebum. Anti dandruff shampoos are usually very harsh to your scalp taking away everything on your scalp that is healthy. After that your hair looks like shit too obviously. The problem with the harsh cleaning after using anti dandruff shampoos is that your scalp is very dry afterwards. But because of how dry it is your sebum production will become a lot higher than it is usual to compensate the dryness. The over production of sebum will cause those flakes a very itchy scalp itchy spots and much more scalp problems.When it gets too much you are using your anti dandruff shampoo. It temporarely gets rid of your problem because it strips away everything from your scalp even the flakes so you think it cured your dry scalp.In fact it only continued your vicious circle. Thats how the dandruff shampoo industry works.If you think about it it makes sense right? A dry scalp would need a lot of moisture if the dandruff shampoo would provide the moisture you need your hair wouldnt be dry af after using the shampoo.I was in exactly the same situation like you are now  month ago.What helped me was first buying a very mild shampoo. So the first thing you should do is getting a really mild shampoo that gently cleans your head. Maybe you will notice  a little more flakes for the first few times because it wont clean your scalp so hard and leave some flakes but after one or  weeks you should see an improvement.My recommendation is urea shampooIt is a shampoo that comes from the horrible industry I talked about but it really helped me. It is without silicones but it is not no poolow poosulfate free  it helped me really good though because it isnt very harsh. It is pricey but you wont need more than a bottle to get rid of the over greasiness.Then you can transition to one of the many no poo alternatives like honey shampoo rye flour shampoo water only vinegar rinse etc.Or just continue with a mild shampoo or conditioner only washing if thats what you prefer.Sorry for writing such a novel but I just felt that I needed to write this because I know exactly how you feel and how much it sucked for me.,NoPoo,clvshtg,3,t5_2sej3

2655712,0,t3_2q3e2j,Check THIS link and THIS link to identify if it is dandruff or dry scalp. Its important to know which you have because dandruff and dry scalp are treated in completely opposite ways.Dry scalp should be treated by moisturizing the scalp with natural oils like jojoba oil almond oil coconut oil Shea butter etc andor washing your hair less often to allow your bodys natural oils to nourish your scalp between washes. Some people experience these kinds of flakes for the first time on no poo when the following happens Their scalps oil production slowed downnormalized because it got used to the oils not being harshly stripped from the scalphair which is usually a goal people want to achieve when they start nopoo but then people do something new that is too harsh and washes too many excess oils off their head or contains irritating chemicals that it hasnt been exposed to in a while like going back to shampoo even a sulfatefree one using an unnatural dry shampoo or too much of one etc thus their scalp looses a lot of necessary oils and now takes longer to replenish its natural scalp oils so it will feel dry until it slowly replenishes them. Baking soda is pretty harsh on hair and can be too drying for some people over time. Honeywashing is a good alternative. Wateronly is a great nopoo method that will allow your bodys natural oils to nourish your scalp... If you are wateronly and have a dry scalp dont waterwash every day and use cooler water to wash your hair. Also be careful how much coconutalmondetc oil you add to your scalp since its hard to wash out globs of oil with just warm water or any other gentle nopoo methods. Use a tiny bit of those oils on your scalp after you wash your hair on dry or damp hair to not look greasy. Note that hotter water dissolves oils better than cooler water including your bodys natural scalp oils which is why hot water is not recommended for dry scalp. Once you moisturize your scalp or wash less oftenchange to a gentler cleansing method the problem should go away very soon. Hopefully this is all it is! The links above will help you determine if your flakes are just dry scalp.Contrarily dandruff is caused by yeast that feeds off excess sebum natural scalp oils so you want to follow methods of removing the yeasts food by washing daily with a medicinal antidandruff shampoo until the yeast subsides. Dandruff is harder to get away from sometimes salt water can help dry out your scalp and tea tree oil is antifungal that can fight the yeast. If you do have dandruff flakes see a doctor or try searching online for natural home remedies like salt water washing or tea tree oil or other natural remedies that worked well on dandruff for others or you can follow the antidandruff recommendations from people on this sub. Just make sure you know its dandruff for sure! I also recommend looking into how your diet affects dandruff.,NoPoo,cn58bx5,1,t5_2sej3

2809802,0,t3_2s7srn,In my experience chlorine made my hair kinda gluggy and gross if I wasnt shampooing after. What helped was using a chelating agent. Its because the chlorine bonds to your hair and just using water alone isnt enough to remove it. The alternative is an  acidic solution which will also help remove chlorine from your hair which is why the lemon juice that ulostforwords suggested will also work. Either option will also prevent the green as what causes the green is copper sulfate ions IIRC binding to your hair and what removes the chlorine will also get rid of the copper.

I start from the nape making my way up towards my forehead making sure I get every strand and every inch of scalp covered.

3080358,0,t3_2va6m8,As someone who has naturally oily hair I wateronly wash once per day.  I gently scrub my scalp under a warm shower spray with my fingertips and then scrunch the length of my hair under the spray.  I use some form of cleanser usually castile soap mixture and vinegar every  days depending on how oily my hair is starting to get.If youre showering multiple times per day especially if you use hot water vs. warm or roomtemperature you do run the risk of dryingout your scalp which can increase oil production and lead to hair getting oily faster andor cause flaking not dandruff just flakes of dry skin on your scalp.  Id choose one time per day to get your hair wet and use a shower cap or other method to keep it dry the other times you shower.You can use sulfatefree shampoo to help transition various brands are recommended throughout the sub.  It costs more than traditional shampoo though you should be using less of it.  Start with washing onceperday for  days and then dropping to everyother day wateronly washing on the days you dont shampoo for  days.  Then drop to shampooing every  days for a week and then every  you get the idea.  Once youre only shampooing every  days switch to a nopoo method of choice in place of the shampoo.  Or you can continue to decrease your shampoo frequency until you only use water to wash your hair perhaps shampooing every  days or less.If you use hair products particularly those that contain silicone wax or oil you will not be able to wash them out with sulfatefree shampoo or most other nopoo methods.

6204892,0,t1_cyut5ex,Sorry I was on a bus when I replied before. I would usually offer more information.I have long thick brown hair with a slight wave in it. I have tried wateronly washing baking soda amp ACV washing shampoo bars honey washing egg washing and cowashing. What dries your scalp and hair out is the water solvent so for many people with longer hair wateronly is difficult to sustain. You would have to be very diligent with your scritching and brushing to be able to keep your hair conditioned with only your own sebum scalp grease.Regarding shampoo bars I have tried three bars. The first was an scented nasty mixture from Lush. I threw it out yuck. I have also used this bar and this bar and whilst they were pretty amazing over time my scalp became less greasy and I didnt need all the clarification the ingredients gave me.The general progression of training your scalp to be fabulous without shampoo is by. Buy a boar bristle brush. To wash your hair start with a baking soda rinse then an apple cider vinegar rinse. There are plenty of instructions around this sub to give you more info on ratios. Do this as required preferably every  or so days. To stretch out the time in between you can use a dry shampoo although I do not recommend any commercial dry shampoos as they contain seriously drying alcohols and sometimes silicones. Choose a flour which matches your hair tone. I use cocoa but others use arrowroot and rye flour. Less is more. Get a teaspoon and sprinkle just an edges worth in a part repart your hair sprinkle just a little bit more. Brush it through and out. When you can stretch out between washes to  days or a week thats the time you move on.. Shampoo bars. They are less clarifying but also incorporate moisturising ingredients. As above use as needed  days until you can stretch it a week. All the time you should be brushing your hair daily twice daily even and scritching rubbing the scalp with your fingertips to loosen grease.. Cowashing. At this point you can move to a conditioner which is minimally clarifying. I use this one and sometimes I mix in  honey for a little more moisture. I use it once a week brush morning and night and use cocoa as a dry shampoo in between if required. The cocoa gives it extra volume and I actually prefer my hair days  after washing due to this.Dont be confused by some who report being able to start water only straight off the bat. They either dont mind their hair looking TERRIBLE for  months or have really short hair. Just make sure that anything that touches your hair does not contain any ingredients ending in xane or cone or contain sulphates or paraffinmineral oil.PS Your hair shouldnt smell. If it is terrible and others can smell it and comment you have a problem that a doctor should be seen about. My hair smells vaguely like a cats fur if I stick my nose in it but only very slightly. What my hair doesnt smell like is fragrances from hair products. If the fur smell worries you spritz your hair with a drop of essential oil in water.Good luck!,NoPoo,cyuxhzw,3,t5_2sej3

7018316,0,t3_4bmyp2,I make lotions and from that I can say that when talking about moisturizing we are not refering to water but oil instead... it is oil that moisturizes skinby preventing water loss?. If you remove the protective oil barrier from your skin and then put water on it it evaporates and is like a wick that sucks even more water from your skin and you will get even dryer like how doing the dishes dries out your hands because the soap has removed its protective layer of oil or how licking your lips instead of applying a lip balm which is moisturizing... but also water free. It is oil that your skin needs. Hair is similar but I am no expert to fully explain. Water without a protective oil barrier will just be drying and cause split ends. How silicone plays into that I do not know in my understanding though I believe that silicone cant be washed out of hair by nopoo methods it required soap to break it up and remove it so it just builds up and builds up instead of getting washed away then reapplied as would happen with the combined use of standard shampoo.,NoPoo,d1bvifu,2,t5_2sej3

7429245,0,t1_d2mj6pw,Oops. Yeah instructions are probably welcome. As someone else said. Dilute it. I used about an  of a cup to  cups of water. I have very long hair. I would soak the ends in the cup for a minute then pour it over my hair and scrub a bit. Leave it in while washing your body then wash it out. And yes it does smell like vinegar a lot when you are in the shower. Once your hair dries you really cannot smell it. BUT if you get your hair wet... it does come back a bit. Something that may work for you but was a disaster for me was Moroccan rhassoul clay. You can Google all the ways to use it. I would mix it very diluted half teaspoon to  cups and do the same procedure. Even leaving it on for a short period of time made my hair to dry and staticy.

8856789,0,t3_500i7b,When you first start the no poo method your hair follicles are producing excessive oils. The excess oil is to offset the damage from stripping your hair with chemicals and even though you are no longer using the chemicals your hair is still producing the extra oil. The oil in turn weighs your hair down pulling on your scalp causing a head ache. To make sure this does not happen you need to retrain your hair by decrease the amout of times you shampoo each week and begin alternating between your regular shampoo and a non stripping shampoo. After a while youll adventually only be using the non stripping shampoo. It is at this point that you slowly wein yourself off of the non stripping shampoo and begin to use only water.P.S.

The only issue I could see with using them would be that it would be difficult to wash out of your hair with only water. Maybe use styling products that wash out easily or use an organic shampoo bar or the vinegar specifically on days you style your hair. The vinegar isnt incredibly effective at getting things out from my experience though. ,NoPoo,dgio2yy,3,t5_2sej3
