68361,0,t3_1uv43h,I started to go down that road but ended backing up a little bit.  Competition seating dies are awesome and I use a Redding.  Much easier to make changes in seating depth and they keep things straight with much less effort.  Highly recommended.I was neck sizing only for a time but it doesnt eliminate the need for FL sizing.  A stuck case in your rifle or one that wont chamber is an indicator you should have FL sized instead. I didnt care for that.  You can adjust a regular FL die to only bump the shoulder back a couple thousandths.  They always chamber and dont get stuck with minimal brass working.I considered the bushing type dies but ended up not going there.  To get that degree of uniform neck tension all necks must be the same thickness.  No big deal it just means you will have one more step to your initial case prep.  The thing that moved me away from it was that my rifle had a standard chamber.  I found out that unless it had a tight neck chamber or in other words one that will not chamber a standard case it was not worth doing.  I just couldnt get full advantage of that extra work.  I also found out a lot of neck turning equipment is garbage and not capable of repeatable accuracy.  It also means you will need a ball type micrometer to measure neck thickness. Research neck turning stuff carefully if you decide on it.  Hope this helps.,reloading,cem7njl,1,t5_2rloq

They are identical in every way except caliber and if you were to shoot each sidebyside you would be hard pressed to tell the difference.  So to me .LR and .ACP are equally fun.  With .LR being so cheap at least when I bought a metric ton of it in  .ACP doesnt seem worth it certainly not at . and not even at reloading prices when my time is factored in.  Eventually .LR will come back into stock at places like WalMart and my guess is the price will settle at  or . each.  Just my opinion but no not worth it.,reloading,cenpov7,3,t5_2rloq

I am familiar with the WC  and have used the H Data as well as the data in the TM for reloading when I pull apart rejects.The M on the other hand with its heavier round only uses WC  .gr. With the recipes you have listed you should be able to load many more rounds than you have pulled.Have you weighed any of the charges you pulled? All the M that I have pulled has been within .gr of the charge listed in the TM.I have also noticed that none of the rounds that you have pulled have any sealant on the projectiles on themselves. Everyone one that I pull has a black slightly tarry substance that ensures the round is waterproofed. The photo was found with a google search.

371614,0,t1_cfj96ky,I have to disagree with you. I own over a dozen manuals and while the fundamentals of reloading are covered each manual gives you a different insight or piece of advice that you wouldnt get from the other ones.  An example of this is one of the manuals and only one of them advises that if youre going to be keeping your loaded cartridges in a very hot vehicle prior to shooting then you should not use ball powders which generally are less temperature tolerant for maximum loads.The other reason is that there are mistakes in all of the manuals.  In fact the Speer reloading manual  which was on its sixth or seventh revision is riddled with them.  From glaring grammar mistakes to incorrect ballistic coefficients listed.  I have yet to see a grossly incorrect charge weight but I wouldnt be surprised that in the thousands of combinations listed in my manuals there are a few.I never load a cartridge without checking multiple sources to make sure that the MaxMin for a particular cartridgebulletpowder combination are all within the same ballpark.  Having multiple reloading manuals gives you the ability to doublecheck charges and have piece of mind.,reloading,cfja7b1,2,t5_2rloq

It shouldnt take more than a time or two at the range to dial in a super accurate load that still meets your power factor. Your advantage is that you can tailor a load to your gun factory ammo will only do that based on a fluke. You can also try different powders some powders burn fasterslower than others and might help you control recoil a bit better.

It will get them pretty clean though.Dry Tumbling is great for large capacities and fast cycles. The start up cost is pretty low but overtime the media costs catch up with you. It creates a lot of dust and noise so you want to keep it outside or in the garage at a minimum. Some units have no dust lids. You can tumble your brass primers in and its usually better this way as media wont get in the flash hole.Dry tumbling cleans the outside well the inside sorta well but whether deprimed or not doesnt do a good job on the primer pocket.Wet tumbling has a variety of start up costs which increases the larger capacity you go unless you build you own. The media is expensive although it NEVER will need replaced.

If its a field gauge you can use it to check the rifles headspace before you shoot it the bolt should not close on it but otherwise it will just sit in a drawer.  If you dont know how to use a headspace gauge in a Garand I wouldnt even bother buying one.  Instead take the rifle to a gunsmith and have them measure the headspace if youre concerned about it.  It should only take them  minutes and cost them about the same as youll be paying for a set of gauges.Personally I think that concerns about headspace are overblown in just about everything except perhaps SMLEs.Youll need the calipers to measure case length and overall cartridge length.

Sorry about not being clear the first time. TIP  If you can push the bullet in by pushing the nose of the bullet against your reloading bench OR pull the bullet out of the case neck easily you will have to seat the bullet deeper and test till you cannot do either. That is why some reloaders just start at  calibers . above the BASE of the bullet. The length of the throat above the neck of the chamber to the lands also will determine just how much of the bullet you have to have in the case neck. Short throat  more  long throat  less.

5827383,0,t1_cxjfud0,Nope I knew that. What I was comparing was that the Lee uses slideinslideout shell holders while the RCBS apparently grips the shell a bit differently. Heres the review on Amazon that got me thinking the RCBS MIGHT be a tad slowerBecause the universal shell holder must grasp the cartridge in order for it to be primed you must remove the shell after its been primed. Let me briefly explain. In the original system each shell had its own shellholder this allowed for accurate placement of the shell during priming. The main difference between the  systems is that once youve primed the cartridge with the old system and hold the priming tool at a  degree angle the primed cartridge will simply fall out. Then you can quickly place the next in the tool maintaining that angle prime then release. I normally have a small container under my priming tool to catch the primed shell as they drop. Since the new system holds the cartridge in place you must remove the primed cartridge as soon as you prime it. This add a layer of complexity that I did not want. Well since this new tool has the newer square primer tray this is all that I use in this system. I suppose it would be a great backup andor emergency backup.This is probably a firstworld problem no big difference either way. IOW removing the shell probably takes just about as much time with this new Lee as the RCBS. Just wanted to throw the new Lee out there in case anyone else was looking for a new priming tool. It is a bit cheaper even when you add the prime shell holders  for the set on Amazon.,reloading,cxjhugr,1,t5_2rloq

It was a bit sharper and loader than I was used to most of my experience has been with gr Winchester White Box I may continue to buy that just as a source of brass but upon inspection of the cases I didnt see any issues with pressure even up to the .gr of powder. Figure Im using a heavier bullet and more powder so Im going to get a little more umpf.

You can see it on the image on the left piece of brass. I provided a factory round on the right for comparison and Im not sure what that ring is from. Could that be from not enough expansion prior to seating the bullet or too much crimp? If the bullet is jammed into case too hard that may explain the unexpected amount of power I was getting or perceiving though like I said I didnt see any of the signs of overpressure I was told to look out for.

Im not going to bother getting back into the discussion on neck tension since you have proven yourself to be completely unwilling to learn. But since you have chosen to purposefully misquote me or maybe you STILL dont understand what I explained I am just going to put what I said here along with information for other people but I am  done discussing it with you. Have a good day. Note I never said expander balls dont sometimes introduce neck concentricity problems like he says I did. However I will state now that when it does its usually a preparation and lubrication issue. gtRegular dies make the neck much smaller then expand it back out obviously. Even with a bushing die you should be using the expanded the benefit is that you work the brass less but unless you turned the necks of all your cases to consistent thickness you didnt and have the right tool to measure them you dont and chose the perfect bushing for the bullets you seat you didnt the expander is still needed for consistent neck size. .gtExpander balls size from the inside which means neck tension is consistent.gtgtWhen you dont use an expander ball you are sizing from the outside. Variances in case wall thickness which is extremely common in virgin brass let alone fired and resized brass lead to inconsistent tension which is why I already told you if you do this you need to be turning and micing your cases for consistent tension.Note for anyone who is not versed in this neck tension is determined by the inside diameter of the neck not the outside the expander ball achieves consistent neck tension by nature of sizing the inside. If you dont want to use it and want the same consistent neck tension as an EX ball provides you must have a consistent neck wall thickness turn and mic your necks. This might not be obvious to everyone but its selfevident. If you dont do this variances in brass neck thicknesses will result in inconsistent neck tension thicker brass will have a smaller inside diameter after sizing and more tension and vise versa. Note that we go to a lot of trouble to hold neck tension to a . or even . tolerance yet neck wall thickness can vary . or more in unturned brass which DOUBLES the variance in tension. So instead of loading every round to say . tension  . of neck tension you end up with a variances in tension of . or more between rounds not to mention a WAY higher than desirable level of tension hundredths. People who choose not to turn their brass but are knowledgeable and concerned about this subject buy bushing dies and match the insert to the thinnest wall thickness they have and leave the expander in. The result is that your brass is sized down much less resulting in less working you aim for say . on your thinnest brass and the expander moves through the brass much easier helping to eliminate concentricity problems a floating button and proper lubrication helps as well. TLDR dont just pull out the expander button because you heard some precision shooter doesnt use his when you lack the basic knowledge of what and how it works like brightshapes. Also when someone takes the time to explain to you you are dumb try to swallow your pride and listen to them instead of demanding they prove  to you. yes I am an asshole but Im a correct asshole the best kind of asshole ,reloading,d7ssjnf,2,t5_2rloq

I resized about  . cases with the hand press and put it back into the box. That was almost three years ago. Totally not worth it. As for reloading in small spaces I have a small work bench in the garage with a small stand next to it. The top of the stand has the RCBS Accessory base plate that I use to mount my trimmer or powder thrower. The stand also has shelves that holds my bullets and to provide extra weight.

If you were trying to minimize investment youd skip the decapper buy a cheaper caliper  ones are fine and use salvaged packaging for loading blocksstorage instead of buying a box.Before I got my hand press I felt like it would probably be ok just tiringunpleasant but once I got it and started merely decapping with it I realized I was very glad it wasnt my only press. If it was Id bolt it to the bench and add a cheater for more leverage but even so...no thanks.

10003159,0,t3_5iwed1,This is targeted for long range shooters in particular but could be helpful for reloaders and rifle shooters in general so I thought I would post it up here and see what you guys thought. My post in rlongrangeWith all of the questions about various cartridges barrel life load data etc. I decided to modify a few spreadsheets Ive made and acquired over the years to create one tool that quickly reveals key decisionmaking variables when contemplating a longrange cartridge selection. This is heavily based on Rexs cartridge selection video in Sniper . The goal was to be able to compare a lot of key variables for long range shooting very quickly. Questions this can help answer Which cartridge will have better barrel life for me? Which bullet weight will be most efficient in my cartridge? How do these two or three powders compare both for maximum range and barrel life? How far can I reach out with a specific cartridge versus another? How does where I shoot affect my range? And many others...Tons of other functions could be added like recommended twist cast per cartridge brass availability etc. but I only wanted to make this so complicated for now.Basically the black cells are user input based on your chosen cartridge bullet and load data combination. Obviously its better to compare apples to apples wherever possible i.e. use  barrel data wherever possible. The red cells return calculated data based on formulas for barrel life and ballistics tables.If anyone is interested in trying this out and has a good way to share it its an Excel file let me know.,reloading,dbbfv48,1,t5_2rloq

I try to slowly remove the round. Not like  solid blow. Usually just tap it until I get movement.When I get a squib in the barrel I break out the brass rod.I havent had either in about  rounds though. Mostly because I setup the stage case gauge check I mentioned above and because I make sure to eye check every case before setting the bullet to make sure there is powder inside. The stage part has found a few rounds that just have this slightly odd bulge even post bulge busting and the second check has kept them out of my gun.I talked to someone about it a bit and they think that the bulge might bounce back on some cases.

Might be ok might not. BUT its a good lesson to learn.

11490745,0,t1_dfyennl,Ah.  Just fyi I used to have both the chronybeta and prochrono digital for pistol but it gave me varying readings depending on cloudy vs sunny etc etc. The prochrono was a little better but my final straw with it was when my . major load was well into the major power factor according to the prochrono but at the competition my load failed.  I never used it after that.  I now use Magnetospeed V for all my shooting.  ,reloading,dfyh3df,1,t5_2rloq
