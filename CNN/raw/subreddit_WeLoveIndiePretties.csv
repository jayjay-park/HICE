325439,1,t1_cfdnrjy,Hi person who decided to create this subreddit here. Going to explain why Im just fine with a mod I selected making that post.Number one is that it was pretty obviously a joking usage. The comment itself was not a joke it was in response to the downvote brigade coming in here and going nuts instead of leaving comments expressing their opposing views or upvoting the comments that had already done so. I believe Ive seen your handle over in IndieMakeupAndMore. You know the issue that IMAM had with this a few months ago? The one that caused the mods to put as many warnings and pleas and explanations of what the voting system is actually for everywhere? I created this subreddit in part due to that. I dont know your personal opinion on using the voting feature for any other use besides the one it was intended for but I personally dislike that kind of thing. I also dislike how its anonymous. I knew that some people were downvoting because they felt they were being unfairly attacked and others were downvoting because they disagreed and still others were downvoting for reasons unknown to me. I wanted to be able to discuss indie without avalanches of downvotes. I wanted actual discussion.I also wanted a less restrictive attitude. I have no personal qualm with any mod a IMAM not whatsoever. It is up to the mods of a subreddit to decide how that subreddit should be handled and what tone they want. It was not my place to insist on changes just as PartftheProblem said so after a few months of discussing it I created the sub. I am and have been pretty damn aware of feminist issues for a few years now. I generally do not like the word bitch. Ive purged it from my vocabulary. I would not allow anyone mod or otherwise to seriously call someone in particular a bitch although if a store owner or someone else who really shouldnt be saying it said it I would leave it up for posterity. If someone has hit that point theyre not contributing to the conversation. However there are way more people downvoting on this thread than participating as if those downvotes do anything besides screw with Reddits display order. They dont. Those people are guilty of noncontribution in this case. PartftheProblem has contributed plenty. This subreddit is not for everyone I knew it wouldnt be. Its for those who either need a more relaxed discussion tone or want it or dont mind it. As I said in the mission statement and sidebar its not meant to replace any other sub. I still visit both and it seems most people do. If this subs tone is not to taste for someone which is inevitable because humor is as subjective as music tastes then they are not required to read it.People are always welcome to question a mods actions I have no issue with that. Im making a big long effort post because this is probably the first thread a lot of people have read in this sub and I dont mind explaining motives. However just as I and others didnt demand changes because we didnt expect them to happen in another subreddit people shouldnt demand changes in this one and expect them to happen. eats crumpet sips tea before setting it back on doily,WeLoveIndiePretties,cfei3co,1,t5_2zsue
