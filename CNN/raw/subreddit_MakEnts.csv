506102,0,t1_cfxonhj,Thank you!Siberia is one of the only liquid foundations to really match my very light skinned self. It also has a great texture!! I love it. It does accentuate flaky patches though so I try and apply it pretty soon after I moisturize my face. The only reason I wouldnt repurchase it is the price. I think its definitely worth it if you have the money though!,MakEnts,cfxsoup,1,t5_30ksj
