10126258,0,t1_dbqyci8,Wow honestly Ive laid out a good portion of this episode on paper and we hit a lot of the same ideas as to what shouldwill happen.Ill give you this.. Frank started the cult for money power or his own boredom? We will find out.. The idea of all of them joining the cult in different ways was also my plan. Dennis going for ladies who are brainwashed easily. Mac having an existential crisis on his own religious beliefs because he goes to tell them theyll burn in hell but sees that gays and others are also allowed so... yeah... Charlie goes looking for frank because he doesnt really believe in the whole religioncult thing but ends up bringing back his preacher in white costume from The Gang exploits a miracle and becoming the cult leader while frank handles the legalmoney aspect. Dee gets dragged through hoops just so she can see the leaderMy idea is to have Dee Dennis and Mac all sign over all of their assets and bank accounts as a means of joining the cult. Frank and Charlie somehow piss off another cult leader who they took followers from. He ends up poisoning the punch that none of the gang drinks because they end up yelling at each other in another room over stealing their assets and being terrible people. The gang eventually hears the bodies hitting the floor and walk into the room to see everyone lying unconscious. They look at each other and dip out quick. Love the idea of bringing in CricketMcPoyles I just dont want to see them die.Maybe McPoyles created their own cult and they try to get back at the gang for stealing their followers by poisoning them? Fitting the McPoyles spike their punch since the punch got spiked at Liams wedding. Idk Im spitballing now.,redditwritessunny,dbrghhj,2,t5_37krl
