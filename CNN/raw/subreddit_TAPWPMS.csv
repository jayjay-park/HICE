It is a joke nomination but it could be whoever attacked me is trying to push it anyway. Also looks like someones voted for you. ,TAPWPMS,cfdl0k1,2,t5_308rm
425511,0,t1_cfou8e6,Meno is certainly a threat but I feel if we dont deal with the cult now it might become a significant situation. I especially dont like Reds defense message what does he mean that there might be mafia to lynch tomorrow?We can take care of MenoSelf and the other power players later but I feel this is prime time to destroy the cult. Also ifwhen we decide to go after Menoself I think we should resurrect more players for us. Just in case theyre followed or something as itll draw huge suspicion to zombie players.I think the masons have been talking to Meno through the system of giving him targets like we can. Speaking of have you been doing those? Ive forgotten to.,TAPWPMS,cfovazs,2,t5_308rm
486883,0,t1_cfvlpj9,Yes that is the plan. I wasnt sure when we had to send in our action. I also havent been paying much attention the past couple days which is my bad.,TAPWPMS,cfvm1wk,2,t5_308rm
621974,0,t1_cgaw4y0,Thanks for your input.gtCobaltGolbem  SelfAligned Vote ThiefYeah Im thinking hell be perhaps the only way to solve that problem.  My plan to toe the line is that when the day thread goes up Ill try to make the first vote.  I dont know if Cobalts considered that the masons are his biggest problem so Ill try to plant that idea with my vote.  Ill say that its most likely hell lynch one of them since its his most optimal play and to that end our only hope is to hammer him before he gets online.  Hopefully he gets online in time to see my idea if he hasnt already independently thought of it and lynches one of them for us.  Then hell be a good kill that night probably.  Depending on whos left.gtdarthjoey  TownAligned TrackerYep not the worst right now but we should get rid of him soon.  Im one of the few publicly claimed roles that actually targets people at night so the town may use him to keep me accountable.gtGenericBuilder  Town or Self Aligned Lynch MachineI checked with dolivar and I can make him commit sudoku.  Just something to keep in mind.gt HelpItsSoCold  TownAligned MasonHes on my side for now which is good.  Should have mentioned this but I got an old stuffed teddy bear from him last night.  Dont know what that means.gtDueling masonsPart of me suspects ones a mason and ones a mafioso by flavor text alone because that makes more sense to me from a game design standpoint.  Two diametrically opposed forces dueling makes more sense than two masons.  If its down to just us three thats my only way of winning saying I bet this is the case vote for each other and Ill decide it.Other than that I think we probably need Cobalt to take them out.gtRenegade  SurvivalistUnknownIm a bit concerned about this one.  Cat flipped mafia which makes me really anxious.  It seems as if there are at least two mafia factions in this game unaware of each others presence.  If thats the case a few of the remaining players could be mafia and I would suspect renegade is one of them given his poorquality claim.  Since I made my claim under the assumption that Im no threat to the mafia anymore since we know everyones roles and he very probably lied about his role I think theres a strong chance he targets me tonight to silence me before I can reveal him.  So Im a bit worried well lose at the start of tomorrow   Im considering killing him for that reason.  I believe hes the best kill.Also I dont know if I can finger Generic as a zombie but I can try when the time comes.Im thinking of stealing from Builder or Darth.,TAPWPMS,cgayw88,2,t5_308rm
