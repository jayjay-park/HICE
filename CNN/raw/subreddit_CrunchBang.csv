9665,0,t3_1u8hnd,If the xmodmap file was the only thing you added prior to openbox not working anymore and then removed it again it should be working again. I suspect you changed more than just this but dont remember because you know alcohol.Check your shell history it might give you some clues as to what your drunk self was up to.,CrunchBang,cefjamn,3,t5_2r7ev
153360,0,t3_1vtvii,CrunchBang comes ootb with a search program called Catfish File Search which I think has the same functionality as Dash. You could bind it to a shortcut such as supers or something and that may work for you.,CrunchBang,cevwdpv,1,t5_2r7ev

1036604,0,t1_chm44hy,Ive heard people recommend that you keep a small osx partition. But the reason escapes me right now. I know one part was firmware updates but I am thinking that there was something else. However it seems singlebooting debian on apple hardware worked out for you? I am interested because I actually am contemplating making the final switch now. Ive been using full time at work and most of the time on a workstation and couple servers at home now but still have only osx on my laptop.,CrunchBang,chm47xw,1,t5_2r7ev
2154329,0,t3_2josbr,Hadnt seen this referenced much and thought Id share it in the subreddit in the hopes that future CrunchBang enthusiasts with similar dualbooting goals may see it and profit from this.  CrunchBang can be quite a mission to set up on Macs so this helped me immensely.  A special note I originally made the mistake of installing the newer rEFIND boot manager instead of the older rEFIT that is referenced in this guide thinking it would be just as easy. I was mistaken this only led to complications for me and I personally would recommend using rEFIT like the guide does unless you really know what youre doing. Hope this helps and good luck! ,CrunchBang,cldnwse,1,t5_2r7ev

3082528,0,t3_2v7n56,I tried installing Crunchbang once and it wouldnt recognize my NIC which I thought was strange since every disto I tried on that older machine worked just fine.  So I started with Debian stable and built up from there.  It was actually quite time consuming and a bit of a learning experience.But through it all I was thankful of Crunchbang and especially the Crunchbang community.  There were many questions I had that were answered on the ! forums.  Sorry to see the disto go but thankful that it was created in the first place.Right now Im working on just scripting it all out but Ive got a lot of brushing up to do on my bash skills.,CrunchBang,cohi37c,2,t5_2r7ev
