8044167,0,t1_d4j0ao6,No one beat Trump because he never had a  on  race. If it were a regular election there would have been a run off election and Trump would have lost.Again the majority of voters voted against Trump. He got  million more vote than the second place guy. What about when you add up all the other guys. You just cant stop at second place guy. You add up all the other guys and they got more vote than Trump. And lets get talk about the elephant in the room. Frankly Trump is a racist. He confirms in the mind of voters the worst stereotypes of Republicans in the mind of voters. That Republicans are racist anti woman anti Black anti Hispanics Whites only party. Just nominating him  damages Republicans and Conservatives because it makes a statement. That his is our man. That a full blown racist represents Republican values. Just like people are still talking about Sarah Palin. It will take years to shake off the image if the racist party. People will still be talking about Trump for years.If the Republicans dump Trump on the convention floor and then later makes a statement that Trumps racist values do not represents the Republican Party that will do a lot salvage the image of the party in the mind of open minded swing voters. You cant convince Democrats but you can change some open minded voters. Because when we had the chance we stepped up and did the right thing and dumped the bigot.The Republican Party is not interested in a suicide pact. They will not walk the plank with Trump. The damage has been done. At this point the best they can do is damage control. Otherwise they face the real possibility of being damaged beyond repair. ,ConservativesOnly,d4k8o5f,1,t5_3dcgq

8764955,0,t1_d7199t8,With McCain and Romney all the polls said they would lose and there were people running around saying not to believe the leftist msm.  However the polls were right.  The polls were almost perfect in their projections.  Trump isnt just losing hes getting slaughtered.  Its going to be a landslide victory for the Democrats.I just hope people still go and vote for the downticket Republicans.Anyone who votes based on political correctness or antiPC needs to find more important issues to care about.If the Republican Party follows Trump then the party definitely left me.  The great thing about conservatism is that its based on principles and as long as you support those principles conservatism can never leave you.,ConservativesOnly,d71a55p,1,t5_3dcgq
8772231,0,t1_d7259rv,At the earliest. I feel like Trump should he somehow turn his train wreck around and win this election will be roundly despised in unimaginable numbers at the end of his firstand only term and the dems will be able to put absolutely anyone up against him and win.Think someone who makes Bernie Sanders look like a moderate republican by comparison.On the flip side I see the exact reversal playing out should Clinton win. I think we could get someone amazing like Rand Paul Mike Lee or Ted Cruz in of course barring the GOPs knack at snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory.,ConservativesOnly,d72716w,7,t5_3dcgq
