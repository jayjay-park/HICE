2853285,0,t3_2mxxis,You probably already did it but just in case someone searches and finds this. Id go with arp head studs and a cometic head gasket with copper spray. Do it right the first time with quality parts and make that bitch run another  miles.  Might as well rebuild your head too while its off. And if youre replacing the head gasket due to overheating make sure you get the head and block milled to match. Id still do it overheated or not if it was my car. ,civic,cnsf3fz,1,t5_2sujg

3905046,0,t3_35320d,I have a short ram and a skunk cat back on my  lx mt and it is significantly more responsive. Faster? Maybe barely but noticeably more peppy. Lowend torque has dropped quite a bit from the large exhaust though but over  rpm it is a lot of fun and makes highway passing a very easy thing to do. Mods on this car are more for the personal fun factor rather than for a performance increase. I love my  mpg and the car is still a blast to drive day in and day out. Also I live in northern New England in the US where it snows like crazy. The short ramexhaust and cm hood spacers REALLY wake the car up when the air is cold and more dense. Engine block heater is definitely a good investment to have with the spacers though. If you have any questions Id be glad to try to answer them. ,civic,cr1eqxl,3,t5_2sujg

S and L dont seem to be named other than that. And low is not something youd use for speedy takeoffs. Judging from your video and the lack of shifting noise from  in a  cyl Im assuming its a CVT so the different shifter selections will tell the computer to power differently. Only assuming at this point S most likely being a sportier feel. L for low meaning hill descends or climbs keeping the revs higher while not necessarily powering on. ,civic,de71cxk,1,t5_2sujg
