3949239,0,t3_35nct8,I think the only other FF like it is . As an MMO Im not exactly sure what you need to do to play. ,FinalFantasyXII,cr6g3xy,2,t5_2uwc8

4774090,0,t1_ctw8m5c,Haha no worries. My friend was also having trouble seeing my past streams and highlights. So Im not sure what was up with it. I looked all through my settings and couldnt find anything that mentioned hiding those from people who didnt follow you.As for people getting mad about saying its like an MMO....they can get mad all they want to that doesnt make it any less true. Ive played both XI and XIV although Ive spent much more time in XIV and the similarities are uncanny. I can say without a doubt that this game was designed in a way to be like an offline version of XI.  It doesnt have that whole attack til you get tp then ws then repeat that XI has but theres a shitton of other elements borrowed from XI. With the success of XI when this game came out and Im sure the outcry of people who dont play mmos at a numbered final fantasy being online and having a sub as I was pretty miffed myself at the time having not played mmos prior I wouldnt doubt that they wanted to both model a game to reflect the aspects of XI that people enjoyed and provide a similar game for people to play without a sub or internet. And as for XIV theres such a ridiculous amount of throwbacks to the game that would take forever to list gtlt,FinalFantasyXII,ctwberj,1,t5_2uwc8
5058671,0,t1_cuuvns9,That shell effect looks nice ha. Those changes to quickenings sounds like a sort of limit gauge. No Mp for quickenings sounds lovely. I will check out the wiki for changes so i dont bombard you with questions ha. It must be hard to go back to the original after IZJS. IF only FF hd happens. Thanks for the info and replys too.,FinalFantasyXII,cuvre9x,1,t5_2uwc8
6375007,0,t1_cze8q2e,Hehe thanks for that that certainly puts my mind at ease and makes the game more enjoyable. I would really like to play with every job and this allows the chance to do it without needing to start over.,FinalFantasyXII,cze9odr,1,t5_2uwc8
7144010,0,t1_d1q6wtr, espers per char belias is a dump to a reserve char and you can take any  quickenings you want without interfering with other chars.  No matter which quickenings you pick you get the same .Edit Fran as Breaker shows you did your homework.  Enjoy the best game of your life.,FinalFantasyXII,d1q75k4,1,t5_2uwc8
7253010,1,t1_d22lgtp,Well you said and X so I assumed you thought I meant on PC. If that was what I meant  arent on steam either! That is a shame,FinalFantasyXII,d22m5wb,-2,t5_2uwc8

8789335,0,t3_50ds90,Really just want to see if they can remove the Effect Capacity that cripples the game speed when there are several enemies on screen at once. I recall watching my characters charge meters restart multiple times after filling completely because so many things happened in between nonnormal attack events.,FinalFantasyXII,d74cb5k,1,t5_2uwc8
9167961,0,t1_d8e3poq,Never said it was the sam.e I just said I dont mind leveling my nonmain party members without a shared system. That just feels a little too stream lined.,FinalFantasyXII,d8e3ucd,3,t5_2uwc8

11252273,0,t3_60esr1,Im similarly nostalgic for it  I started listening to the soundtrack when the game came out using it as background music while playing Counterstrike. It became my goto music for any and all online games I love Phon Coast Penelos Theme By the Water Mosphoran Highwaste Rabanastre Downtown Salikawood Dalmasca Estersand Boss Battle... I love them all. And thanks to this games OST Ive become something of a Hitoshi Sakimoto fanboy tracking down almost every soundtrack hes made in the last  years and keeping them on my Dropbox so I can listen to them whenever I want.Definitely looking forward to hearing the live versions of all the music. Im sure many tracks I wont like as much but just as many will blow the originals out of the water.,FinalFantasyXII,df7ffoz,2,t5_2uwc8
