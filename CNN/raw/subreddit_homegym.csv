2547690,0,t1_cmr1um9,I just picked up the SML during their sale. It replaced a Titan power rack. In terms of strength and stability this thing is very very sturdy. I havent bailed on any squats yet but my grip failed on a heavy heavy for me a bit north of lbs rack pull. Id guess it fell from about  free fall. It barely budged. I am waiting on the dip bar still but based on the sheer girth of this thing I dont think heavy dips have any chance of torquing it.I have only two real complaints about the stand and they are my own fault for not thinking stands through. First even though the footprint is no larger than the rack it replaced using it takes up a fair bit more room. This is because the uprights are in the middle of the rack so by the time I walk out a squat my heels are on the edge of the platform. Second I like to do chin ups or pull ups between bench sets but have a hard time doing them without moving the bar to the floor between sets. Sorry for shitting all these words on you unsolicited.

This certainly means that you will not be able to baby the weights down onto the floor at the end of each rep.

For me that was really worth it because I dont have any friends that are in to fighting that much to practice with besides when I train at my local MMA gym. I wanted the grappling dummy because theres so many great instructional videos for nogi BJJ like Gracie Combatives or Serra BJJ basics.

I think you only need to go full power cage if you are lifting some serious weight this one is fine for me.It does move a tiny amount when doing pull ups and dips.

10181743,0,t1_dby4j80,gt think like OLY liftersKeep in mind competitive Olympic lifters usually train on how to bail on a lift and have the platform and equipment to dump the weights without any damage. Imagine for a minute doing a heavy set of squats youre tired youre straining to keep upright. Then you need to aim the bar into the tiny squatstand rack. Careful not to tip it over or your face is going to get stapled to the floor.Thats why we recommend a full powerrack  if Im exhausted after squatting I just jam to the weight into my racks uprights and it will fall into the Jcups and not kill anyone.A squatstand like youve linked works OK for startingout but once you start moving some big weights theres a significant safety issue to consider. ,homegym,dby5nuu,2,t5_2ts8i
