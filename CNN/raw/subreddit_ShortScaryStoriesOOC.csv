174932,0,t3_1w1ucg,There is quite a bit of stuff on SSS that is derivative and painfully similar to stories that came before it.  If you post it to reddit expect it to be stolen.  Hell expect it to be stolen and reposted on reddit!  These things happen.  Ive been not credited for stories as well as out right plagiarized.Try online publishing if you want to protect your work and even that wont prevent the copy pasters sometimes.  Unless you or a publishing house is willing to hire an army of lawyers people will take it if they like it and call it theirs.  So consider it public domain friend and try to not let this type of thing get you down.  I know it sounds harsh but this is something you should be prepared to come across quite a bit in the world of internet publishing.Long story short dont be mad unless theyre taking money out of your pockets by profiting on something you intend to sell.,ShortScaryStoriesOOC,ceycx1j,1,t5_2x955
458754,0,t3_1ysw4j,Everyone seems to be of the opinion that in this small a format character development falls by the wayside of story. I dont disagree if you have to choose one choose story. But that doesnt mean you cant develop BOTH at the same time. The key is developing the character in a way that furthers the story. Characters who are themselves the story murderers psychopaths malevolent entities etc. allow you to talk about them and their story simultaneously. You can do it in reverse too. What happens in a story the choices the character makes the way they respond to situations can establish character just as easily.,ShortScaryStoriesOOC,cfserek,4,t5_2x955

10297086,0,t3_5n61ws,Youve hit on a very important distinction. Sometimes telling is ABSOLUTELY the right way to go. It should be a finesse tool in the writers pocket. I think greener writers tend to default to it because its easier. Its more natural to pen words as the writer may speak then aloud to a friend... until you learn otherwise What type of longer project are you working on? Longer short story? Novella? Lets hear those details!!,ShortScaryStoriesOOC,dcb8b3q,2,t5_2x955
