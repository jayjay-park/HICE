788842,0,t3_236ivf,Im only badge currently but Ill see if I can give you some things to think about.Deagle on pistol round seems bad to me. Which pro players do this?Buy armor against eco players. I know youre saving for an awp but if you stay alive youll be able to keep the armor for later on anyway. Reload AK when you pick one off the ground might as well have  bullets instead of . Pay attention to low ammo in a couple of other spots too. No need to hunt down an ecoing player with hp. ,csgocritic,cgty1jm,3,t5_30ekl

997052,0,t3_25g74z,I watched the second demo Well I just accidentally lost all the notes I had for Tside. Basically what I said was your money management was terrible. If your team has  members with guns then fine buy a P with helmet and nades. But if your team is saving dont waste all that extra money on a round youre supposed to lose. Just buy a P and hope for a kill. If you have extra money maybe throw in some nades but commit to the eco. Theres a span of four rounds in a row two which you guys won where you dont have a gun. Thats pretty unacceptable. A P on pistol rounds is pretty pointless. Headshots are all that matter default pistols are fine. After a won pistol round rush as a team. Especially if you arent buying a gun you can get a teammates gun if they die. You might as well buy an SMG if you arent rushing a fast AWP. By my count  rounds in the first half you didnt buy a gun. I would be completely annoyed if a teammate did that to me. Round  Yup your teammate nails it omg gedai dont waste your money everyround .. After a lost pistol round I personally buy at MOST a P and one nade. Its almost impossible to get full value out of all those flashes in an eco round. Round  By itself not a bad buy but two nades on top of all that money spent last round is draining your money too much. Your team wants to buy next round and youre sitting k below them. You overvalue HE nades way too much. Especially once the enemy buys armor HEs are practically worthless compared to smokes and flashes.At B site You played the same spot too frequently so it was easy for them to predict where you were in the later rounds. You peeked a little wide on rushes and panicked a lot. You just full spray and miss most of your bullets. Got caught with a nade in your hand a couple of times.I dunno what else to tell you. Your team pretty much nailed it you spent too much money too often. Your crosshair placement was a bit sloppy too low too high and inconsistent not so smooth hugging walls but combined with your aim was pretty good and better than I expected for an MG when you werent panicking. Your peeking was pretty weak. Especially the pushes out long which were mostly running and spraying. Practice quick peeks where youre ready to shoot right away. Aim servers are good practice.Your nading wasnt great and needs improvement especially on a map like Dust which is super popular. You value HEs too much and dont throw enough smokes on T side. Learn to use flashes for pushes and counterflashes for holds.I honestly didnt get a very large sample size to work with because your economy management was so bad. If  of your team can buy armorhelmetrifle then its a buy round if not its a save round. Buy in buy rounds and save in save rounds. If money is out of balance the rich can drop guns for the poor. If you have to do two save rounds in a row youve probably mismanaged your money.,csgocritic,chhmeni,3,t5_30ekl

1047692,0,t3_261qc4, Round  I think both the HE and incendiary are a big waste of money when money is tight. Round  After you see two guys get out of long you should be falling back right away since you have no support. You stay and then peek way too wide exposing yourself to three enemies. If anything you should be peeking slowly looking for an angle to fight v and definitely shouldnt be peeking past double doors. Round  Not sure why you bought a scout and a defuse instead of a famas. Thats pretty bad unless youre strangely good with a scout. Bizon buy is even worse. Round  With bomb down and v you should probably just save your gun. As a team you have lots of money so its not a big deal but thats a pretty hard retake. I would just look for exit kills and try to take some guns off the T side. Round  You have  and the best you can buy is a P? Thats not good. Round  You shoot your pistol way too fast at long range. Its not that accurate.Pretty weird demo to choose since it seems like you and your team are having trouble taking this match seriously. Your crosshair placement was at times pretty good but largely inconsistent. Too many times you were looking nowhere useful werent at head level or just got lazy.So many bad buys that would drive me nuts if you were my teammate. Three rounds of HEIncendiary is almost an M and they never got you anything. Overall I didnt feel your CT nades were that effective and you frequently put yourself in danger to throw them. I just dont think they were worth it. Nades on T side were pretty much nonexistent. Especially on Dust theres a lot of common smokes and flashes that have a lot of value.A lot of your deaths are just not respecting dangerous areas. Especially if you arent comfortable with rush timings you should be ready to shoot so you dont get rushed down. You dont always check all the cornershiding places. After theyve seen you peek one angle its much more dangerous to peek it again. For your rank I dont think this demo exposed any huge weaknesses for you it was just a lot of sloppy play and simple mistakes.,csgocritic,chndl8p,1,t5_30ekl

4696440,0,t3_3f8n2u,Round  Not necessarily a huge problem but initially when your team pushes b you stay near the center of the tunnel and actually prevent your teammates from pushing up more if you plan on sitting back hug the wall of the tunnel or push out onto site.Round  Be careful when preparing a smoke like that there were a good  seconds where if a ct awp peeked you from site  goose you would have had no possible way of defending yourself. What you can do is learn a smoke where you are less exposed or just throw the one you did quicker. When you approached the site being the closest to said site should have pushed up ramp and challenged anyone on the site while your teammates dealed with CT instead you got caught off guard and lost this gunfightRound  This push went arie however you should have at least tried to take a shot at someone on b site once you were on their side of the smoke and if you wanted to retreat you should have taken out your knife and made it out quicker also you went straight back and not back and to the right a better way to avoid gunfireRound  On  occaisions you throw smokes in such a way that you can get easily peeked by the area youre throwing the smoke at First ct then short. slightly thereafter you go for a spray at someone jumppeeking you when you probably should have been more patient and gone for taps or even backed up and let your teammate on short deal with him.Round  Again running straight up long with a smoke in your hand.Round  You fail to check cat or even clear site. Check your angles and you may win rounds exactly like this.Round  Once you reach mid doors you peek CT exposing your back to  the doors and the window if a ct were watching mid from either position you would have been dead. Next time use your utility to your advantage. When you got into window you killed a guy instead of pushing forward after that check plat and car back up and choose your further course of action dont just force it into a gunfight immediately as you may well loseRound  You pushed right behind your teammate against an auto which still had  rounds. What should have happened is you either use your utility somehow to deal with him flash him smoke him off and rotate or you just yolo it and hope for the trade kill. Not a reliable strategy.A side note the perfect counter to an auto is an awp as one shot is one kill to the body so before the auto can get off its second bodyshot its already deadRound  Again you try to spray someone who is jump peeking you which I guess because of panic. What you have to do is have a calm and clear mind and just try to tap tap him away or reposition so you can either escape him or kill him some other wayRound  You exposed yourself when you pushed into b site with your knife out and also when you walked in view of someone outside b doors while staring down the windowRound  Youre going for sprays when you simply arent on point with the sprays what you need to do is adjust your play tap more burst more etc or learn to spray better. I would suggest both. Keep on burst firing as the first  bullets are easy to control and spray will come with ease eventuallyRound  Not entirely your fault Im sure but teams should coordinate buys and save rounds. You linger in and around ct too long while the enemy team plants. This time could have been better used repositioning to short an argument could be made that you may have been able to save a couple more guns due to more of your teammates being alive and perhaps it could have won you the game.Round  When pushing short you utilize none of your utility also when you back up you dont look long which you probably should have done since you exposed yourself to that areaRound  When getting into pit it is customary to back up so you can jump into it therefore giving you the ability to peek when you want to and not just get shotRound  This round was lost by no fault of yours the main issue was the triple awp setup your team tried to employRound  You took too long to throw the nade and you peeked it far too widely.Round  In the end you died because you were hiding behind the box perhaps what you should have done is push up onto plat perhaps back up but staying in one position too long makes it easy to counter by the enemyEdit this is my first demo review so CRITIQUE ME on it hah,csgocritic,ctmiytu,1,t5_30ekl
4864136,0,t3_3hdkkv,rGreenYuJust skimming through it i can tell you guys dont really know how to play cobble as ct. As well as you dont seem to know how to rotate. cobble in mm is very t sided because of b rush and drop rushes but they barley did that surprisingly.Here is the c pov against fnatic. Mirror where they hold mirror how they rotate how they use nades smokes and mollys. If you all just watch this i think you will be able to make a better default and learn some alternate positions you can play on each site. This isnt a skill problem its just a lack of any knowledge of cobble problem.,csgocritic,cu7ntmg,2,t5_30ekl

5310031,0,t1_cvq5rm2,Thanks for the reply do you know of any maps to improve aimcrosshair placement?,csgocritic,cvqf21l,1,t5_30ekl
5408145,0,t3_3oxart,Right. You have very weak crosshair placement both in the height at which you hold your crosshair and the ways in which you position your crosshair. Your movement is also really bad it takes you a long time to get anywhere because you bump into things or take really wide corners. And you wont improve unless you fix those things. If you cant get kills and a lot of the time you cant then its not worth doing anything else. This just takes practice in deathmatch and maybe watching some videos on crosshair placement. Oh and your aim is largely pretty bad too.But you also make another big mistake. Your personal economy management is just garbage. Youre out of sync with your team you dont buy on pistol rounds you buy nades and dontcant use them you rarely use them but when you do you waste them you play armour glock second round and the glock does no damage to armour really and the whole enemy team has armour with a full nadeset you dont use. Look youre clearly better with rifles so stick to them. Save for them. And dont buy a deagle. If I were you Id stop buying nades. Just never buy them. Id never buy deagles. Id focus on buying a p in save rounds and rifles in buy rounds. With full armour in every buy round. And just work on improving at those basics. Everything else comes later but also matters more later. Theres no point throwing bad nades or bad flashes just because professional players throw good nades and good flashes. Oh and dont save in pistol rounds. Theyre far too important.,csgocritic,cw2y8ua,3,t5_30ekl

5607396,0,t3_3rwfaa,Demo ReviewIll type up my notes which I write on a roundbyround basis. I will include a conclusion at the end to summarize all of my points however I still recommend you read through my notes for a more detailed analysis of your demo. Additional links will be provided at the end of this post as well.Round  Starts first half as CTRound  Good smoke by you  B Crosshair placementRound  Crouching too much You and another holding the same angle at B way too close to a smoked tunnel Crouching again!! Hold still when shooting to better control your accuracyRound  Crouch jumping unneeded when going to B and slows down get into position Crosshair placement Grabs AWP at Round  All of the Ts are at A doors but you take your time clearing tunnels did your teammates at A not call this out? Good job on checking corners for a lurker regardless Turns back to enemy Cannot find Ts at A doors anymore because of delayed rotate Knows that the remaining enemies  are in spawn and chases after them instead of playing site with teammate You get a pick Because nobody was defending sites T gets bomb plant money and extended time Go through tunnels double scope no!!! will get into later big box but eventually get the kill Defuse and win roundRound  You and another CT go B but nobody is watching mid for a flank Watching the same angle as a teammate againRound  Nice AWP k by you  B  Good job holding the angle with AWP instead of getting impatientRound  You promptly rotate to A once callouts are made niceRound  Watching mid with AWP STRONG mid control by you take out entire team sweet picks!Round   Ts AFK until ? Enemies hold A doors while you flank them at T spawn but you get picked off because of positioning. Round  carrying team lolRound  doublescoping nooooRound  guy on the other team calling you a smurf haha work on your tracing accuracy aiming at moving targets ill put a workshop link to an aim map at the bottom HalftimeRound  Try to entryfrag but get flashedRound  SMG rush middle with no smoke until  and you are already at doorsRound  Goes cat but throws an extremely late mid smoke You secure B but your teammate with the bomb goes A? Communication issue?Round  P despite team going full buy Have to peek to throw flash big nono. Throw flashes that do not expose any part of your body i.e. bouncing it off a wall or pop flashing Pushing through mid but you expose yourself to angles from CT and B mid. Play better positioning otherwise youd have gotten wrecked in higher skill groups Stay on site when your team is planting please dont run around searching for that last kill. You never know if they are a Maikelele clutcherRound  Your team secures A You walk all the way to cat to drop a smoke exposing yourself to the CT on short. Throw smokes and flashes from afar. Speaking of learn some good smoke and flash spots. It will help you and your team immensely throughout your time in competitive. You rush the enemy on cat but get killed due to lack of recoil controlRound  P again? Rushes AWP with SMG gets the kill though. Dont let this become a habit though higher levels will not fall victim to that.Round  Spams mid withauto Your team splits A doors and B tunnels bomb is dropped at B tunnels but you and your teammate push through A doors and onto site before rotating through CT spawn. You and your teammate push onto site to get bomb instead of going through tunnels to secure it. Play CQC Auto Sniper depending on noscopes to kill enemy. You die to himRound  Buys AK for the first time drops random smoke at mid doors again dropping instead of throwing and gets ambushed from cat are you the real kennys lolRound  what are with your team comms? everyone is all over the place with no direction buys P smokes mid from vulnerable spot nice smoke kill at cat! flashes self through smoke and stands there exposing yourself to A site team went B but you were at catwalk? Im assuming you were trying to fake even though CTs died at B alreadyRound  team scattered again crosshair placementRound  last round Buy AWP for the first time on T side Watches mid for  seconds before jumping away without calling out that  guy crossed to B Good job at taking A v both CTs are down by B mid and you challenge both of them who have snipers instead of playing site and die. Teammate in v situation flees to pit ??? but gets the kill and wins the roundGame win ConclusionYou did really well for a Silver . Im surprised you arent already a Gold Nova! Your potential for awping is strong and I suggest you keep working on increasing general accuracy with that weapon. I was disappointed to see that you only picked it up once or twice on T side and chose to go with the P instead. However you do need to work on basic concepts such as angling and crosshair placement. These are vital mechanics you need to work on if you want to get past those rough silver ranks.Also double scoping was something I noticed you do a bit when you took on the role of designated AWPer. You should only DP if you are working an angle from a distance and need to react quickly the moment they come out. Otherwise dont use it because the single scope will be able to compensate for any other situation.Other than that practice recoil control with weapons like the AK and MA on your downtime. I notice you had some problems with your accuracy because you didnt pull down far enough or not at all.

5811486,0,t3_3uoxs5,Im not good enough to comment on the other things but heres a link for Succeeding in high pressure situations. Might be of a bit of use for not choking it helped me out a bit. Clutch My personal advice would be to have a plan and execute it. Just clean like that. No overthinking or fidgeting around. Trust your aim. Dont think about your aim. Youve probably practiced it A LOT. The aim is already there. If you have it down to a  on  situation and you know where he is I wouldnt slow down and try and think of all the possibilities. By now youre body should already know what the correct play is i.e. just go with a specific play because if you got to where you are right now then it should already be ingrained into your body how you should win this v Its how you won the other vs. Execute the first thought that pops up. If it didnt work out then you can go back and watch the demo on that specific play and see how a different play would have worked out.

6716440,0,t1_d0dzitm,sometimes you peek window from t balcony late and waste time when you can just peak it from the bridge and wait for the ct to peak window. so if hes not there after a short period of time  secs just keep going pushing through apts. Ideally You want to go apts and not even wait for window so you can get even better positioning. but most times you spend alot of times just waiting for a kill in window. rather than getting early fast apts control. if you get apts control during rounds   then you will get alot more rotators the remaining rounds before they get to your team at b or push your team through mid. in most cases they are rotating and you dont know where you need to be to get a kill on the rotators and be an effective lurker.another way to lurk A while your team is b is to just get to the bench andor push through mid to a while your team is headed b,csgocritic,d0e1dqf,1,t5_30ekl
