11258525,0,t3_60lo1h,Hey. Idk all the backend of winamp but its been my goto for almost a decade Ive learned how to play along for the most part. Ive recently been getting back to basics and reorganizing my music from the ground up. Its daunting but its paying off huge.Use Mptag You will edit your metadata. I know you said you didnt want to but this tool does almost all the heavy lifting. You could theoretically do your whole library at once and make it relatively painless.I have all my album art embedded in the metadata and about half right now contain some sort of folder.jpg too. I know Winamp will pull from that if metadata albumart is absent. I think if its missing it takes the lowest seeded tracks embedded album art and represents it for the entire album.Im guessing Winamp is pulling folder.jpg and its different procedurally and why you have a short drawdistance. But I do know what youre describing and have had the same issue before. I do not have it with embedded album art though.Additionally make sure youre sorting your library by Album Artist not just Artist. Its going to be a mess if you dont.....,winamp,df84xu0,2,t5_2t9it
