999063,0,t1_chhudll,gt I numbered the plays local to each quarter actually because I wasnt aware what the preexisting scheme was. Id be more than willing to change the identifiers I have to make them conform to nfldb or at least to add a field for the nfldb playid like the fields for the GSIS player id and the nfl game id.Ah I see! I like the idea of having a sequential identifier as ground truth for the order of plays.But I think including nfldbs playid which is actually NFL.coms play id is necessary to connect a play in your wiki to nfldb.gt There is a CSV import function that can be used to enter data a little more quickly but there are two major drawbacksAh I see. It sounds like your issues should be fixable in some way.gt The last issue is getting the data out of the wiki into a more efficient database format. There is an export function for the software which I havent actually used yet but it would require publishing an updated database every so often for advanced analysis. Im not opposed to this really but I do think its worth noting. Simpler queries can be run directly in the semantic mediawiki software.Yeah this is definitely something worth doing at some point but youre right its probably not important now. It would be interesting to develop some sort of feedback loop between nfldb and your wiki. This may be difficult to architect since it has to be a cyclic loop but definitely doable.,NFLstatheads,chhunek,2,t5_2thmv

1568846,0,t3_2c7d8i,Personally as a human picker what I learned is Be Less Confident in my picks. In more than one week I wound up selling the farm due to one or two easy picks that I put in the  or higher confidence and got wrong. Id be looking at something of an  split.  of my picks got me  of my scorepenalty.Even if my penalties for each of the correctly picked games was higher a  reduction in confidence across the board would have moved me from occasionally DFL to consistently middleofthepack or at least around the nopick line.And I think thats indicative of how the bots work. Make your picks but dont overvalue ones that should happen.,NFLstatheads,cjcxfd9,4,t5_2thmv

10374881,0,t1_dcj64fc,My guess is Belichick is smart enough and confident enough to ignore the halo effecthe doesnt care what youve done. If youre not playing well someone else gets your spot. Also I wouldnt be surprised if the starter doesnt matter as much because they rotate players more. I think coaches especially coaches without a decadeplus of tenure are likely to be hesitant to sit aging stars and trust players judgment about when theyre tired instead of their own.,NFLstatheads,dck209j,1,t5_2thmv
