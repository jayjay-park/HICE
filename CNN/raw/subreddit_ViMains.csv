9595986,0,t1_d9vqht0,I would like to add to this. I think you are probably fine starting W on red considering it has negative armor and you get a two man leash but I have found success starting E when starting blue assuming blue side of map. The aa reset and shield from passive lets you leave the camp with full health and you can do it smiteless with a good leash. On Red side I am not sure if you need the shield if you start on red buff considering its negative armor. I am sure we will figure out the optimal choice as the pre season goes on,ViMains,d9vwgel,1,t5_39cwq

9994857,0,t3_5iqyup,As any jungle matchup its like chess. To beat lee sin be lee sin. Think what is gonna do where is gonna gank and where hes gonna countergank.Some tips to skirmish himYour Q stops his dash As everyone told you even his W if you manage to catch him mid air. if you got hit by his first Q but theres enough distance its not hard to stop him. you can pointblanc q but if you start chargin up as soon as you get hit you might scare him or either stop him pretty easily. A good lee might wardjump to to change the line of the dash.Since your ult is unstoppable if you time it correctly while youre melee you wont get knocked back by Dragons rage.I suggest to set some controlwards in some keyspots so you can spot him and you will know if hes gonna counter you or something like that.,ViMains,dbacwbe,2,t5_39cwq

10761994,0,t3_5tvdb6,. Farm.. Look for lvl or lvl gank. Farm.. Gank with lvl. Farm. Try not to farm when ult is up.. Farm. Build dmg. Mute all. Destroy everything.Dont gank top if dragon is about to spawn. After gank make sure you do the right thing clear minionsleave themtake turrets.Especially when ahead build dmg warriortfghostblademaw and into tank. Do not dive act like an assassin. You are the king of skirmishes like vs you do not want to fight vs so get fed and end as quickly as possible. If youre topside and enemy toplaner is gone and you see enemy jax botlane invade take his blue if not ward it. Wards on enemy buffs give also lots of Informations.In General once you get few early kills you just snowball all the way and destroy everything so do not care about KS whining or whatever just mute and do your shit.,ViMains,ddq0qha,2,t5_39cwq
10888795,0,t3_5vkfkd,Graves is a straight up hard counter to Vi in my opinion other than his lack of hard CC but he makes up for it with his W. He farms better is stronger early stronger late and oneshots from range. Really the only chance for Vi to win a v against him is if he just used E and is alt tabbed or something. W stops Vis entire kit and he can most likely instakill a Vi without her tank items. I wrote a comment about how to deal with early invade junglers that can help a bit but theres only so much you can do against a broken champ. ,ViMains,de33o89,2,t5_39cwq
