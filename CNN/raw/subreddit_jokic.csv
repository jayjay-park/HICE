11212536,0,t1_df2och3,Thats why I find this debate fascinating.  What makes a player better his individual stats or his contribution to team wins?  Me personally think its contribution to team wins however that conclusion changes General assumptions about whos better in history.  If you go by contribution to team wins for example you whould have to hold the opinion of Billups gt Iverson and stuff like that.  ,jokic,df2xf73,5,t5_3fyyb
