4142451,0,t1_crsfxvk,Well the amount of RAM is just one factor.  Benchmarks are good its also good to research real life issues like how long the battery lasts.  Its nice to have a good benchmark score and to a certain extent it shows the performance youll get but once you reach a certain threshold it doesnt really matter how high your benchmark scores is it makes more sense to consider other things.  For example the Snapdragon  is a really fast chip and gets excellent benchmark scores.  But it runs really hot so in order to actually use it the manufacturer has to throttle it.  You can see the benchmark scores decrease once it gets hot since it has to run at a lower frequency to not overheat.  In the end it can sometimes take longer for the  to complete tasks due to this throttling than a lower end chip like the .  So while the  is better on paper in real life practical applications it can be worse.,zenfone2,crsgggp,1,t5_36c14

6100578,0,t1_cydr58l,I dont know if OP will check back on this by now but I will respond to a couple of things to clarify what I meant by them.On App Development Its true that the snapdragon chip will eliminate nearly all app bugs. In fact the only app that doesnt work well on my Atom chip is hearthstone. Snapchat works well too except it doesnt get lenses like the GS or other popular android phones do.On Updates Asus is pretty open about their update schedule sometimes but the updates come really late. For example the LG G has . as of a few days ago. Meanwhile the Zenfone  will get . but I dont believe they have even have a time schedule for this phone. And . came out in october.On the UI Agreed that its preference but even icon packs and builtin options dont remove the overall feel Asus has placed on the phone in my opinion. And honestly Zen UI feels dated and childish to me. I definitely prefer stock moto sony etc.On the camera Since youre actually a photographer I defer to your knowledge but when I say the camera isnt amazing I mean in comparison to other smartphones. The iPhones camera has more useful features and snaps pictures way more quickly and pictures just look better than the zenfones. I know since pretty much every person I know has an iPhone. One thing that comes to mind is my front camera could not handle a bright sky well during selfies but the iPhone did. In my opinion the camera is simply something you skimp on a little bit by the getting the zenfone compared to GS LG GV etc...,zenfone2,cyj2nwy,2,t5_36c14

6571828,0,t1_czykkmh,As a counterpoint I believe that the bloat isnt bad at all. ZenUI is also more intuitive than the AOSP UI. Furthermore having excess RAM and a decent albeit relatively dim screen is nice. Overall performance and UI are both a solid  for me. HOWEVER...The issue of this phone does not reside in its performance or software but rather its poor quality control. I had to replace two of them due to defective circuitry. Many will say only the people have problems will complain. In this case when the problem is the exact same for many users its safe to say that the defects in this phone comes in batches. If you get a good unit you will have a really great time imo.

9019465,0,t3_53b6n0,Had mine ZEML Deluxe since December . Havent experienced any issues at all except for bricking it once due to my own curiosity luckily fixed it myself. I have always been a budget phone guy. Before this I had a nd Gen Motorola Moto G g and before that HTC Wildfire st smartphone ever. Compared to those in their own time Zenfone  is a beast. I can run almost everything I need and could with flagships. With Moto G it was a constant lack of space and RAM. So Zenfone has been absolutely fantastic for the  EUR I paid. If it lasts till December without problems then I will count my money well spent and be happy. Based on this experience I see no point in buying a  EUR phone ever.Used to be on CM for a few months but the constant signal drops and failures to switch from g to g were atrocious. I mean unless I noticed myself that my phone is without signal then I could have been out of reach for hours. After tinkering and bricking it I returned to official MM and its been fairly stable and Im currently happy with it until CM comes along.,zenfone2,d7vzye8,1,t5_36c14
