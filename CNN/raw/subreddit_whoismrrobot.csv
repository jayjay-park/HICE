4458293,0,t3_38vbtg,Im already a fan of this show for the portrayal of the MC with anxiety problems.  Im not nearly as bad as him I can function just not in groups but I dread those nights where you remember how lonely you are.  Fantastic portrayal.I liked this another.,whoismrrobot,cssnd48,4,t5_38fm8

4624396,0,t3_3e92ia,Alexander wouldve probably demanded too much money or he could be taking a break from acting seeing as he is only a year and a half removed from filming True Blood which lasted more time than it shouldve. That being said Martin is doing great in the role but Alex is too perfect looking. Im a completely hetero male but that guy is fucking insanely handsome. He must trip on women every time he opens a door...anywhere. Besides I dont think I could buy Alex as a sort of computer nerd and the dynamic of sharing similar ages between Elliot and Tyrell gives the show a Superman vs. Lex Luthor type vibe. Thats just my opinion though.,whoismrrobot,ctdh8tz,4,t5_38fm8

4810584,0,t3_3grobd,This was a popular theory when Mr. Robot was noticed to not have any dialogue with anyone except Elliott in the first few episodes correct? The last two episodes hes been talking to everyone so doesnt that pretty much kill this theory?,whoismrrobot,cu0wwsx,1,t5_38fm8
4810748,0,t3_3grgbr,I live in NYC. Ive seen dogssexhomeless peoplebandsdancerssingers almost anything goes tbh. As for why Elliot spends a lot of time on the subway it is the main way to get around the city cars are almost seen as inefficient here. ,whoismrrobot,cu0xnoj,3,t5_38fm8

4822517,0,t1_cu23d7l,I didnt even think of that. That would be fucked up. They could be gaslighting him and taking advantage of his crazy all to get him more indoctrinated into fsociety. Damn. ,whoismrrobot,cu2f1ys,11,t5_38fm8

5014542,0,t1_cupqo6f,gt  Wheres Tyrell? Posted this in another response    i have a terrible theory that Tyrell will end up being another personality of Elliots .. just feel that interaction between him and the wife points in that direction.. why else would she try to speak to him in her native language if she didnt expect him to understand her. plus the way she doesnt let the babys face be shown..,whoismrrobot,cuqfwyj,10,t5_38fm8
5035180,0,t1_cusd8et,I dont have to because its an unreliable narrator.Again Im not claiming they are the same Im claiming its quite clear the writers want us thinking theyre the same. It could just be a deliberate red herring as its way to obvious. Im just making it clear that great pains were made to convince us they are the same.,whoismrrobot,cusxieo,-1,t5_38fm8
5098896,0,t1_cv030kh,Youre right the tune is Nearer My God To Thee. Heres it being played on a harpTheres some decent foreshadowing throughout the show like mentioning if as a kid he should watch pulp fiction but it could be a red herring. Its also worth noting that Titanic has the potentially famous fact of the Captain going down with the ship. Perhaps thats what its hinting at?,whoismrrobot,cv0lvcz,1,t5_38fm8
5111422,0,t1_cv1knnx,Makes sense. Upon taking closer look I noticed that in the scene with the change Mr Robot suddenly disappears into thin air. This points to it possibly being Elliot in Mr Robots persona bothering those two men. It also explains how Elliot in other episodes doesnt remember parts of the day possibly because he would be Mr Robot during that time.I also noticed that when Elliot is first taken to the hideout he wasnt introduced to the other hackers making me think that they already knew him and as you mentioned probably know of his mental issues either because of his sister or because they met him before. ,whoismrrobot,cv24953,1,t5_38fm8

8538548,0,t1_d68tq2z,oh yes absolutely mind you last time i had dantes in my hands was  years ago! did you come across the bookThe Outsider by Colin Wilson? It touches upon some of that dichotomy without going into full blown dissociation. The thing I am struggling to grasp is why so little of humanity honor that friend? I know the truth is different for each of us however more and more I gravitate towards the solution of seeing that people are just mainly unaware they are sleepwalkers. How would you distinguish dreaming and psychosis? Or even just normal day  how would you distinguish which state is which if you are inside one? Elliot is seen as hallucinating and creating an alternative reality... He may as well be sleeping or being in a coma. Did you see Men on Mars  British TV series from about  years ago? It portrays just that rich inner world of a patient in coma. It goes on for few good episodes so you can definitely imagine that. And all players are just figments of ones imagination...,whoismrrobot,d68vvzq,1,t5_38fm8
