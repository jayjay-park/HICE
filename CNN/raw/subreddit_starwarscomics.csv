6056566,0,t1_cyddldr,With Disney coming in starting in  I think all previous content other than Clone Wars Rebels and the six films has been thrown out in terms of what is considered real in the Star Wars universe. All the new Marvel comics are considered canon.As far as your initial question I am not really sure what you mean. Currently there are three main stories in print. Star Wars Vader and Kanan. Kanan is about to be canned but Vader and Star Wars are going strong. In addition there are a few side stories going on one mini series for Lando Chewie Leia etc.Here is a good link for you it lets you filter all the canon media and see only what you want... whether its TV comics books so on.If you are totally new to them I would seek out the trade paperbacks for each of these series. They compile multiple comics in order in a thicker paperback comic book.,starwarscomics,cydihsr,2,t5_35ool

Owen knew Anakin was a Jedi and a warrior but the dude was a war hero. I guess Luke wanting to be involved in the rebellion would work his uncle though. Hmmmm.
