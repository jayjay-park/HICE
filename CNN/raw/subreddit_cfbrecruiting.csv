11016007,0,t1_degmcnq,Good point.  He seems to be following orders instead of following instinct or making a play. That isnt necessarily bad and it could be tied to his coaching but a good running back has to make a play happen sometimes and that means always being aware of ways to change the play. ,cfbrecruiting,degmtdv,3,t5_2t6u8
