988274,0,t1_chgig9e,From my understanding ceiling fans begin to wobble when people slow or stop them with their hands. This throws the balance and alignment off.If you can figure out which prop arm is off balanced or bent positioning this very minor weight and drag air friction in the right spot can correct the imbalance.Honestly seems like it would be pretty hard to do accurately though. Im curious as to how they figured out where exactly to put it without hours of trial and error.,redneckengineering,chgmhd0,3,t5_2xwua

10514773,0,t1_dcyprtx,It wasnt difficult. By the time I had the gas pedal installed I had been without use of my right leg for a year and a half or so. The injury happened when I was young so I only had a bit of rightfoot driving to unlearn not  years worth. That would have been more difficult.Though it took years I have made a complete recovery.
