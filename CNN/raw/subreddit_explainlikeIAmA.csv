60224,0,t3_1urhlo,Time is a funny thing. We created it to organize our rotation around the sun into segments. These segments range from an entire rotation what we call one year. Years have  mostly even parts that are called months. As well as years these months make up seasons and quarters.  months is about a season or a quarter. The main way to tell the season is by the temperature.Months are broken into about four weeks each. Each week being seven days. A day being one solar cycle. Days are broken into hours which are sixty minutes which are sixty seconds! Those are the basics of how we organize our entire lives.,explainlikeIAmA,celacem,2,t5_2t5iz

76837,0,t3_1uw61f,So about a year or so back the government sent someone one of the princesss aides or personal assistants I think to our town to check on preparations for the festival we hold every year on the solstice. Everything is in order really theres no need for her to come  sometimes we screw shit up but I get the feeling that the princess really doesnt give a shit she just loves seeing us put these festivals on. Anyway she gets up in everyones business making sure the food is taken care of the farmers in town have prepared enough food to sate a herd of horses the forecast is clear the music is set up and the town is decorated. By the end of the day shes clearly at her wits end probably from dealing with commoners and the party at the end of the day  where were supposed to stay up all night to see the sunrise because tradition or something  didnt help either.Imagine our fucking surprise when not only does the fucking sun not rise but the princess doesnt even show up. Instead some crazed goddess in battle armor shows up and starts ranting about how the night will last forever and promptly disappears in a cloud of mist. Everyones panicking and flipping out when suddenly Little Miss Protege runs off with her pet lizard and five of the towns event organizers in tow. A few hours later the sun rises and they come back with the Princess and someone else. Apparently the crazed battle goddess was the Princesss sister who was banished a thousand years ago but they blasted her with some magic rainbow shit and shrunk her down. Mustve shrunk her ego too because she was crying the whole time. I guess I cant blame her.Anyway since then this towns become an absolute fucking magnet for weird things and those six assholes who went into the woods are behind all of it I swear. ,explainlikeIAmA,cen6d1f,3,t5_2t5iz

Pot Industries employs a huge workforce of people and these people spend the wages which I pay them to buy other things like produce from your little farm here which puts money into the pockets of people like you so you can buy things too! When someone comes into your home and destroys your pots the money you spend replacing them gets passed on to my workers thus generating economic activity which would not have otherwise taken place.

Why do many things about day to day life in glorious peoples republic Soviet Union appear superficially similar to misrepresented and exaggerated lies of capitalist oppressor George Orwell?

Love is glue of strong equal society my friend.

This is not less choice friend it is more! Now you dont choose book by cover you choose book by appearance and proficiency in various technical skills such as underwater welding and general HVAC Repair studies.You further assert that state surveillance in  is superficially similar to Uncle Boris program of precision installed video surveillance and assistance devices. Comrade you have been misled! Uncle Boris as we lovingly describe our cold steel surveillance tubes is friend! Why what happens one day when keys become lost? State provided wife and friends are nowhere to be found but hope is not lost! Simply contact the state bureau of lost keys and watches and a standing committee of experts will survey the placid Moscow Avenues free of charge!Soviet Utopia is far from  comrade. Ministry of love? Pah! In United Soviet Socialist Republic and Associated Moon Colonies we do not accept such terms.

It operates as a network comprising both a multinational stateless army and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global jihad and a strict interpretation of sharia law. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council NATO the European Union the United States Russia India and various other countries see below. AlQaeda has carried out many attacks on nonSunni Muslims nonMuslims and other targets it considers kafir. Amidst the Syrian civil war Al Qaeda factions started fighting each other as well as the Kurds and government.As mentioned there it doesnt work for any government. But it does have leaders. Several of these leaders were in Afghanistan namely Osama bin Laden. bin Laden was the person who organized and planned the attack on the World Trade Towers on .Afghanistan while not controlled by AQ didnt admit they were inside their country and support them. The Unted States along with other NATO countries due to treatie agreements declared war on Afghanistan for attacking on a country. Starting the first War on Terror.Cut to  years later. Paranoia is everywhere. Terrorist that terrorist there. The US Government who was feeling pretty good from winning the Cold War but lonely from not having a thing to pick at hears of whispers of WMDs from Iraq a country that may also have members of AlQeada.The CIA along with other governments sends out spies and other says to track for these WMDs. Due to the treat of WW happening they mistake some data for others and believe that Iraq has nuclear weapons.The United States tells the United Nations about the possible threat and the UN investigates. Mean while the USA is prepared for war and sending troops and ships. The UN declares that they couldnt possibly have any and all data is incorrect. So the UN votes in wether or not to declare war on Iraq and they vote No. Ha. says America and declares war.It doesnt really matter where the people involved were born or lived. If the people who planned it were in another state country etc. then you investigate and attack there.It shouldnt matter if John Doe born in California raised in New York living in Texas. But attacked Colorado and his employers if he has any are in Hawaii. You might investigate his house but you really look into where it was planned Hawaii. If you look there you might find more info.I hope this helps. If anyone can correct anything here let me know! ,explainlikeIAmA,cizmi6e,3,t5_2t5iz

He has a pallet in his left and is speaking in a soft deep calming voice...Now while doing this you have to imagine that inner sadness and let it overtake you. Let that inner misery be your guide here. This here should really make you sad. I know it makes me sad wouldve made my mom sad too Im sure. Goodness do I miss that lady. Were gonna take a little bit of that obsidian black and just mix it in there to dull up that blue a little bit thats it thats it. Very dark and sad color. You can see how much that black brings out the color of the tears on his face what a nice little contrast we have there.Bob continues with a rising and falling inflection to his voice still painting.If you like this call your station maybe they can stand you for a few minutes. Or not really makes no difference to me. Now Id personally use a one inch brush to accentuate the strands on the noose but Ill leave that you up to you. Its your little world no one really cares. Just a few lonely little lines on the noose all solitarylike not touching one another or connecting thats it very very nice.In the background there were gonna just sweep the big brush lightly across that part of the canvas there thats it. Now you dont want to go too hard across here what were doing is giving the painting depth here we want to be able to see the body of his wife in the background there but we dont want to ruin it... There we go thats nice.Lets use the two inch brush here and just mix a little bit of scarlet red with that brilliant white so we get a nice dark pink there we go. And well go ahead a put a little bit of that on there riiight on the edge of that little pool of blood nice and easy. Just let it bounce around a little. Thats a nice little highlight there.And with that I think well call this painting done what a sad little time weve had here together. Maybe we can get together soon and... do this again.

3198781,0,t3_2wr8nd,.  In the beginning was the drive. And on each machine were found the A drive B drive yea even the C and D and E drives.  But no machine had the files of another  and so on the first day the users connected them creating local networks and it was good. Then the great ARPA joined computers across distances and packet switching enabled them to share their files.  There came the day of the Trial when ARPA looked for the first time on what had been made researchers in one place phoning a distant laboratory and saying unto them  We are typing an L. Do you see an L?  And the others saw the L and it was good.  Two more letters were typed and the system halted failing.  But on that day a new thing had begun. But ARPA was jealous with what it had wrought  and forbade its use to those who were not defense contractors saying unto them  The protocols of packet switching you may use  but my network is forever closed unto you. Ten years passed and the network of the great ARPA grew.  Those who knew of it waxed covetous for what had been forbidden them..  It came to pass in those days that Ellis and Truscott conceived of a connection which would link their Universitys own network to another  and for this reason did they go unto their friends Bellovin and Daniel to help fashion it.  And Ellis and Truscott and Daniel dwelled at that time in the land of Duke and Bellovin in the land of Carolina and so the two were connected.  The miles between Duke and Carolina ceased to bar the words of those who used this connection.  They named it Usenet spreading its links across the nation. It was in those days that the land of Berkeley was joined in the connections of Usenet  though the people of Berkeley had been granted the gift of the great ARPA.  And so knowledge was able to pass across the boundary which had separated the two.  ARPA joined in those who had made other great networks seeking ways to connect their networks.  As the connections waxed separation ceased  and thus was made the one Internet of many parts. In that time Usenet remained a favorite tool of those who dwelt in the Universities  sharing research and discussion.  In the month of September each University found itself flooded with new students  and these did not know the customs of Usenet  and the people of Usenet taught them the way  and in October sense returned..  Lee was in the land of CERN and the land was fertile and brought forth great quantities of data.  Lee was in the land of CERN but was not of it  and while he sojourned there he amused himself by crafting his database with hypertext  and with this tool he kept his data.  When Lee left the land of CERN he made a gift of hypertext databases to its people. Lee returned unto the land of CERN and saw that his creation was now used by all the people.  And in the years since Lee had left CERN had learnt the incantations of TCPIP by which means men join the Internet.  Lee had a vision of a great hypertext database  and in his vision the database was not on a single drive  and the database was not on a single network  but lo it was spread across the world by the power of the Internet  and the scientists of the world added to it  and each could gaze on the data of his colleague  and the database connected them like a web of rope.  Lee wrote of his vision  hoping for pages of data that would change as people used them.  And the hunger for this web grew and with Cailliau to help him Lee created the parts he would need.  But the web was small and the pages of data were simple displays of fixed information  and there was but one machine that could use it. Others came Pellow and Pollermann and more  and the web grew and the pages multiplied and it was good..  In the same time that Lee was first in the land of CERN von Meister brought the Internet to the homes of those who were apart from the Universities.  These could not use its power to talk to one another  for they were served only the protocol of GameLine  and by that means they rented video games without travel to the video store.  For there were video stores in the Earth in those days.  In time it came to pass that the makers of GameLine crafted new things for their subscribers  and they called themselves AOL  and they allowed the users to send one another mail and instant messages.  AOL fashioned games played across the internet and users could speak to one another within these games.  But the users of AOL were in darkness for they knew not the light of the greater Internet beyond the confines of AOL.  AOL then connected its users to Usenet  and the people of AOL did not understand the civility expected by the people of Usenet  and the people of Usenet said it was like unto a September which had no end. AOL found Brandt and said unto her  Go to the people and bring them all unto us.  And Brandt told AOL I will send them trial disks by which they may access your service for a month at a time  and the free trials shall come to them like the waters of a flood and the disks shall fly like a flock of pigeons so numerous as they pass as to blot out the very sun.  And with Brandts disks the numbers of the people of AOL flourished.  And the rest of the internet did mourn the loss of what had been  for they were outnumbered in all things by those whose experience was under the control of AOL. But AOL had released its people from its cloistered garden  set them to graze in the pastures of knowledge which lay beyond AOLs control  and in time they departed from the control of their provider with ever greater frequency  and what they saw was good.  In time even AOLs messages were allowed to go to those whose Internet lives were not subject to the dominion of those who had sent them Brandts disks.  Lees Web was a meager thing  but it was potent  and the people of the lands hungered for a way to add their own content.  Many turned to GeoCities making their virtual homes in places themed after their content  and their content was ugly and used the ltblinkgt tag too much. In those days men hungered for a way to seek out information on the subjects of their choosing  for when Lee had first crafted the web a link from one page to the next was the only way  and locating useful data by this process was a laborious and often fruitless art.  Nierstrasz created the first tool to search across all content but its limitations were many.  Aliweb and WebCrawler and Lycos and Yahoo! followed each better than the one before  and many others but each had its own faults.  To resolve this problem Dogpile was created searching all these things and showing the user the best of each.  Soon came Google better than all that had come before  and others bowed before it.  It is from this foundation that the makers of Google built their empire  offering fresh services Gmail and Chrome and Drive..  In time Lees vision came to pass the pages of hypertext changing with the data and the users need.  Forums were made and people discussed topics trivial and profound  put captions on cats  spread their wit far and wide.  Bandwidth grew and videos were shared  It was in those days too that Bauman affixed his watermark to all videos for a time  that all your base came to belong to us that the directive first came to us to leave Brittany alone  that the pledge was made to never give us up  and that badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom  for many heard that others liked mudkips  and humor deteriorated into nonstop references to this kind of thing.,explainlikeIAmA,cotjxi3,428,t5_2t5iz

The thing is we dont really ride horses or carriages anymore. I mean you do but... never mind.. We sit in machines that transport us with wheels like automatic carriages. Now that you realize how far we have come you must know that alot of these machines we use require oil. Oil is worth alot more to us than gold and those countries which follow the Koran now spelled the Quran have an abundance of oil. So we keep fighting these perpetual wars under the guise of protecting our freedoms against those trying to impose Islam on the west. And to this end we do a great many things which you probably would not consider constitutional? Slavery is not around anymore in the form that it was thanks to you but us black folks did suffer quite alot for a good  years more and many still continue to but i am black as you can see. And i am president. And i can see your face turning red because you did not want us to be this equal but here we are... Thanks to you. The fact is though that you and the founding fathers would most likely not agree with the state of the union today. I the president am pretty much bought off by big corporations which operate on a global scale. See The United States has been hijacked by a wealthy few who do not care for the wellbeing of the common man.

We need to hire more of these guys even though none of them have the proper qualifications. There are a few of them who do but they have all been gobbled up by the most prestigious space firms. So instead we hire the others who are most charming. but just seem to be different. We will hope for the best.Fred Well that seems odd. Perhaps those from the South need more jobs becasue of hte legacy of imperialism.George Oh God no! I do not mean South like developing countries. They are privileged. You see a poor illiterate peasant from China or Viet Nam who moves here has so many advantages that we must actively discriminate against them to promote equality. Instead we need to provide privileges to those who have already been given large amounts of benefits in the form of free food housing and even cash benefits. We especially like to encourage home with social structures we know result in child abuse and criminalitywe call these single parent households. We reward these and encourage them to have more children. Fred So you hire these criminallyinclined children?George Oh  you silly archaic fool of course not!. We hire the children of elite community leaders that look like them in order to promote social stability. We do not care about the majority. We simply fake it so they do not riot like animals. Fred So the idea is to promote equality?George You really are a dinosaurriding retard! No we pull up a few token representatives into extreme wealth while we seduce the rest to kill themselves with drugs and poisonous food. We even have a final solution prepared where we pay them reparations in exchange for them signing away their only remaining rights. The best part is that they do not suspect anything. They even think they thought up the idea. Then we can focus on helping our Muslim brothers complete our last solution in the Middle East in exchange for energy policy concessions. ,explainlikeIAmA,cplpqyh,1,t5_2t5iz

Hey Billy there has got to be life outside of ours here on Earth hasnt there?  I am here to show you today that there may not be.  Just listen to this...   Our sun is just a HUGE star a pretty average one at that.  There are MILLIONS and MILLIONS of other stars out there in the galaxy like it.  Now you can bet that there are planets out there revolving around that star that are almost JUST LIKE EARTH!!  THERE COULD EVEN BE LIFE ON THEM!!  If that is the case now here comes the AMAZING part then that life might just have interstellar travel since we here on Earth are already working on it.  THEY COULD HAVE ALREADY STARTED VISITING OTHER PLANETS!!  We should have been visited not one not ten not even one hundred but THOUSANDS of YEARS AGO.  Not just once twice or ten times BUT HUNDREDS OF TIMES!!  Yet we havent to our most reliable knowledge or sources. So I ask WHERE ARE THEY?

However the plot and in some cases the music bear little resemblance to the original as Disney had most of the lyrics rewritten and some of the song tempos drastically changed. gtThe toy soldiers would later appear in Christmas parades at the Disney theme parks around the world.gtgtImage iRelevant Henchman | The Parade of the Tin Soldiers | Family Classics Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcscd oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecscd.

4525960,0,t3_3d0foz,I was born into a part of the world that is very well off. New technology and new things are created every day. The very way the world changes comes from my part of the world. Most people live better lives than you or your family ever have. But these people dont really care about everyone else. Id like to think I do. The way I was brought up and the way I was taught have shown me a lot of different views of the world. I was educated. I went to a good school to learn about the world and to learn a skill set so I could make an impact. To change everything. But right now Im trapped. The way the system is set up is to a point where someone can live their life with the bare minimum never escape the cycle and go on about their day. That doesnt help people. It doesnt help anyone but the people at the top. The wealthy and the people in control dont give a shit about anyone like you or me. The scope of our problems is huge and I cant break out to help anyone else. I cant help change the laws of the country you live in. I cant help the people around me. I cant feed a starving child on the street. They taught me how to be aware of what they were doing and then forced me into a situation where all I can do is watch. I know I dont get beaten. I know I have my autonomy. But in the end you and I are just people born to work for others and then die. In the best of situations surrounded by those we love. But I doubt either of us will get that pleasure.Anyway make the best of what you have. And I will do the same.,explainlikeIAmA,ct14vkp,11,t5_2t5iz

4609246,0,t3_3e3efm,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know.That said.In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it.Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan.I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories.Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it.I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things.I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care.The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them.I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome.That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that.Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments.And uh Im a pretty good moderator.All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

7686948,0,t3_4kfkvc,Doc I swear I am telling you the truth! No I have never done drugs in my life! I love my family.Why wont you believe me!? It happened exactly like I told you before. We were all sitting around the dinner table about to enjoy our daughter Reys first attempt at meatloaf. You see she really wants to go to culinary school next year and just has a real talent for cooking. Sorry getting off track. My wife cut the first piece and served it to our son Fin. Fin and I both LOVE meatloaf always have. This meatloaf was Reys take on an old family recipe but with a twist or so she said. Sorry sorry this is just hard for me to talk about. After Fin grabbed his plate our cat Wookie jumped up on the table. She is normally such a sweet little angel face of love and would never ever jump on the table. We all yelled at her to get down but she wouldnt budge. She then started to shake and hiss violently right at the meatloaf sitting in front of Fin. She then lunged at the meatloaf claws out. This is when it gets a bit strange.All I remember next is this brilliant bright purple light exploding into the dining room. Everything got so bright I couldnt make out what was happening at all. I could just hear the screams of my family and  im not sure why but what sounded like an old episode of Family Fued. We dont even have a TV anymore and we have a very strict no phonetablets at the dinner table rule so I dont know who that would be even possible. Next thing I know the roof of our house is shattering apart it start to rain in our dining room. Everything then starts to spin around and around like we were all stuck in some hellish purple tornado. I dont really remember anything after that its all just a blur. Then I blacked out.When I woke up there I was in the middle of what used to be our house. When I stood up I realized that I was huddled over  weasels....like I was protecting them. I have never seen a weasel before and they are not an animal indigenous to this area. I thought the weasels would run as soon as I stood up but they just stayed right by my side as if they knew me. It was then I noticed that one of the weasels was wearing what looked to be a miniature version of my wifes wedding ring. I dont know how I knew it but I was  sure that these weasels were my family. I know they are! I dont know how it happened!......Yes I used to dress up clams professionally in tiny little outfits but I hardly see how that is relevant.  That was a few years ago and the Clam Cosplay scene isnt what it used to be.wait..you think I dressed them up like that?! Why would I do that? I love my family why would I turn them into weasels and play dress up? No they are my family..I swear they are!!!! Doc why dont you believe me!!!

That and the fact that your mask looks exactly like Kaitlyns face me assume that youre my late girlfriend. Sorry I just now brought it up it just took me a while to come to terms with the situation. According to my Pokdex Yamask arose from the spirits of people interred in graves in past ages. I guess a few months counts as a past age now. Regardless you seem pretty happy with our odd situation. Im fine with it myself although it kind of makes that mourning process seem really pointless and tiresome. Take it easy I didnt mean that last thing. But you should probably know that this relationship whatever it is cant last forever. I know its a bummer but its probably better to come to terms with this sooner or later. Youre an immortal ghost Pocket Monster and Im just a dude. Im not sure how one becomes a ghost but Ill just assume that Im not going to become one after I die. Im definitely not going to go out of my way to be a creepy ghost. No offense. You see eternity is an awfully long time to be alive. Im not sure if you can process how long that is but I know I cant. Whats half of infinity anyway? If something cant be divided in half you know thats a long period of time. Some people have a hard time just getting through a measly sixty to a hundred years so Im not sure I would want to go on and on like that. Plus once youre immortal I dont think you can go back to being a guy who dies eventually. Im pretty happy with what Ive accomplished so far so just Ill assume that Ill be ready for the big sleep when the time comes. Emphasis on the sleep. Face it Kaitlyn Im not coming back after I kick the bucket as far as I know. A lot of things can happen in an eternity but I think its probable that one little guy in a big universe isnt special enough to come back from the dead without being a weird ghost thing.

9031771,0,t3_53wyb9,Note As its fairly obvious from the rest of the comment thread that OP made this solely as an excuse to rag on Steven Universe Im gonna flip the script. Presenting Explaining the story of Steven Universe like youre somebody who hates One Punch ManSteven Universe is a story about real people and the challenges they face with their own identity and the relationships they have with people around them surrounded by a subplot about magical alien parasites from another world.Let me explain.These days for animation especially animation with action scenes you have two kinds of animationAnimation that takes its tropes completely seriously. This would be your Dragonball Z style anime. Its loud its raucous the characters are serious about saving the world the usual.Then you have the animation that subverts that trope. For a completely random example lets take the shitshow of an anime One Punch Man. One Punch Man is supposedly a deconstructionparody of Shonen Fighting Animes. The main character realizes he doesnt like being weak trains SUPER HARD to the point where he can obliterate anyone in one punch and then becomes so powerful and unstoppable that he is bored with his life. The credit for his accomplishments are stolen by others and he doesnt really care.And.... thats the show. For something that mocks the onenotecharacter of Shonen Animes One Punch Man doesnt go anywhere beyond that. One Punch Man is bored... and thats his character. The rest of the series is fighting scenes and some stupid little kids that get in the way everywhere and are annoying as shit.Lets get back to Steven UniverseSteven is a young boy who is growing up under the tutelage of The Crystal Gems a group of magical women who have gems embedded into their body and fight monsters that also have gems embedded into their body. Steven is technically a Gem too as his mother the former leader of the Crystal Gems died when she gave her Gem but he has no idea how to control his powers and is too emotionally immature to participate in protecting the world. The episodes alternate between him attempting to be useful and interacting with the various normal humans in the town he lives in.Okay first twelve episodes thats a pretty simple plot right? Wrong.It turns out that each of the Crystal Gems originally each representing one of the classic strong hero tropes strong leader intelligent planner funloving strongman have complex motivations for what they do and how they interact with Steven. Weaknesses are revealed for each of them and complex and intertwined backstories are revealed. Details of the Gems being part of an ancient conquering force are hinted at and its quickly shown that the Gems are actually the sole survivors of a rebel group that wanted to stop their race from wiping out the earth with all the pathos that implies. Steven grows from a simple child to an interesting character who was to wrestle with the pain of not being able to live up to his mothers legacy and retain his humanity at the same time. Each of the three Gems discovers their own weaknesses recognizesand grows throughout the series. The Gems and their relationships are explored as Homeworld begins to direct their attention to earth once more. What was once a rebel group of thousands is only  women and a child now and the Crystal Gems may not have the strength necessary to stop their Homeworld from taking over Earth again.All that is in the next  episodes  min per. Im not going to go into what happens after that but it gets even more interesting with character motivations conflicts and backstory being revealed layer upon layer of real human feelings.I understand the characters in this show. Their pain their regrets their prides everything about them. I understand them more than I do a lot of people I know.Compared to most One Note Man characters Hes funny because hes bored! Steven universe is Real in a way that its simplistic art and songs would not imply.Most animation is popcorn You eat a couple of pieces taste the starch and grease and love it. But only simpletons eat popcorn all the time. Theres nothing else to that food no complexity no depth no interesting tastes beyond the very basic desires it fulfills.Steven Universe is like Japanese cuisine the kind where you get your main dish and a ton of smaller vastly different smaller tastes. You can combine them in lots of different ways and each dish works with each other just a little bit differently so that by the end youve sampled hundreds of different tastes and appreciated them all.Amount of research done on One Punch Man read TVTropes page and watched a few youtube videosAmount of research done on Steven Universe watched every episode.

The later can only be purchased at the central bank of Reddit. Area th largest worldwideLanguage English of questionable accuracyReligion Dogmatic atheismElectricity Until server downCountry Code ...Internet TLD .comUnderstandReddit is a country with a rich history and many server outings. It is one of the premier destinations of the world wide web and attracts many visitors each day. The island lies east of Twitter and north of Skype bordering Troll Bay and the Sea of Memes not far from chan with strong relations to Facebook Youtube and the MMO islands. The various cities and communities of Reddit are known as subreddits which are connected by the costumizable frontpage. The largest of these are located in the Defaults densely populated areas with a highly mobile population. Other highly frequented destinations can be found in the rall though an experienced visitor of Reddit will soon understand that these regions only represent a small sliver of the geographic and memetic variety that the country has got to offer. Exploration and costumizing the experience is therefore strongly recommended. PeopleThe local population is known as Redditors.  For most tourist Reddit has become famous for its population of neckbeards. Even though neckbeards can often be observed in the wild they are by far not the only ethnic group to populate Reddit An attentive observer will easily spot shills SJWs furries trolls top minds fascists console peasants trumplets historians Muskians bronies members of the PC master race berniebros feminazis pedos ebophiliacs and many other groups in the wild. Thus the fedora is no longer a part of the traditional garb although it does help to blend in certain locales of Reddit. Get in     Entry will be refused to citizens of gagA visa refered to as a registration in the local parlance can be acquired on site. An email adress is minimun requirement for identification purposes. The travel itself can be easily be reached through its website or via app. Travel agencies like Google or Apple might be needed for the later. Seeriama A place of worship where PR agents pretend to be celebrities and desperate celebrities attempt to save their flagging brand. rgaming The city of rgaming is very well known even outside of Reddit and is often derided as a tourist trap. The locals engage in peddling cheap toys and replicas of nostalgiaenfused souvenirs which are produced enmasse. The city is said to be the birth place of le gem although le gem has not been seen on rgaming for a long time anymore probably because it cant stand that place anymore either. raww Reddits petting zoo. It is also known for the artists which frequent it often and draw sloths. rrelationships This town is known for its many gyms and lawyers. Its drama group is of premier quality and worldwide reputation. raskreddit One of the prefered local hangouts where the locals gather to exchange strange sad and sometimes uplifting stories over a beverage. Purchasing a stockpile of tissue papers before visiting is highly recommended. rdogfort If you are travelling with your dog this military installation offers a firstgrade military education for your pet. Access to felines is strictly prohibited. rtechnology The local Elon Musk fan club offers a great assortment of activities like watching SpaceX videos free Tesla rides and listening to motivational sales pitches. rbooks For a long time having been known as a premier place for literary inspirations rbooks has since been replaced by a mismanaged Borders store that only sells used copies of Orwell Harry Potter and other bestsellers. renlightenedbirdmen The local aviary harbors a delightful assortment of intellectually superior birds who ocassionally break out of their confinement and attempt to take over other parts of Reddit. rfuturism Set up by Reddits science education program this is the place were the hopeful inspiring news get casually crushed by actual scientists who happen to be passing through. rthedonald We dont talk about it. raskhistorian This quaint town lies at the river of knowledge and is well known for its cottage industry of readable treatises. The visit has gained quite a reputation among afficinados of its local produce yet casual visitors should be aware of the very strict local constabulary. rtotallynotrobots A place where normal human being enjoy doing normal human things. There is nothing strange about it. DoReddit offer a huge variety of activities and Redditor enjoy talking about them a lot. They including gaming and movies other activities which often take place in a place refered to as outside are often encouraged but thus far Redditors do not seem to have found a way to engage in them.  Redditors engage in an impromptu sport which is known as commenting. Commenting can be done alone or in a team. The purpose of the sport is to gather as much upvotes as possible and to crush the opponent. Opposing players can be easily spotted by not liking things that you do. After this initial move the player is either required to denounce the opponent or to make a joke. The players then make their moves in turn. The player with the most upvotes wins.  Media coverage has attracted an interest in the countries frequent visitors. An engaged community is meticulously documenting these sightings Thus one can often see Keanu Reeves sitting on a bench or Leonard DiCaprio casually strolling down a lawn. Contributing to the photo documentation of celebrity visits is strongly encouraged.  Due to Reddits strong literary tradition storytelling is one of the most highly priced talents among the locals. Storytelling contests often attract many of wellknown writers of Reddit although this sport is not as well regarded outside of specifically designated areas. EatReddit has a long coastline on the Sea of Memes and its strong relation with the neighboring Imgur Island. Thus local delicacies often come in the form of memefood such as pics and videos. These are usually consumed onsite for extra freshness. Secondhand memefood is frowned upon. Other notable foods are the gif pronounced jiff in the local dialect and videos. The later can often be found in the the great market place of rvideos but also happens to show up in many other places. Tourists should be careful though as  depending upon your location  the food might not always be appropriate to be consumed in front of children or in the workplace. High quality delicacies can usually be found in the locally sourced oddly named SFWporn network not to be confounded with the shitty network which is known for its abysmally low quality. DrinkThe legal drinking age of alcoholic beverages can be inquired at raskreddit and is therefore always lower than one might expect. Note that drunken Redditors can often be found out in the open. Incoherent ramblings are the result and are usually widely appreciated by the locals. They are often even rewarded with Reddit gold. SleepSleep is considered an unnecessary nuisance by most Redditors and can still be done after going on a stroll down the rall highway one more time. CopeReddit is known for mischief and illicit behavior refered to as shitposting and reposting. For an outsider these incidents can result in the delightful display of the locals getting outraged. If one wants to join in local pitchfork sellers often offer discounts when these events unfold.  RespectIt is costumary for visitors to engage with the locals tipping them with upvotes. You should not downvote ever yet it is a wellknown secret that all Redditors engage in this behavior. Most Redditors consider respect of the local laws also known as Reddiquette to be an optional requirement. Punishment through local security forces mods and the federal law enforcement admins is often arbitrary and instant. They can include banning from certain sites or even the dreaded shadowban which turns the visitor invisible. Appeal against these punishments involve a byzantine process that is devoid of logic and sympathy. A disdain for these processes has become costumary for the locals.

10683069,0,t3_5ssehn,Well I think it is terrible. If you go with what Clemenceau is saying with the Versailles treaty Germany would get a fair deal. Now you can say that that is okay and Bauer can say that that is okay but its not okay with me. Because based on what he is saying and based on where hes going and where hes been you can take land and money from Germany that is rightfully theirs and rip it away and tell them it is their own fault. As far as the Rhineland is concerned if Hitler wants to go in  and I got to know him very well because we were both on Lord HawHaw. We were stablemates and we did very well that night. Hitler has big plans for Germany. He wants to edge out its neighbors so that Germany can unify all of Europe. I believe Hitler will continue to rebuild the German Empire. He has zero respect for Roosevelt or the U.S.! Hes running his country and at least hes a leader unlike what we have in this country. I respect Hitler and Germans but cannot believe our leader allows them to get away with so much...Hats off to the Germans. Hitler has become a big hero in Germany with an alltime high popularity. Roosevelt on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD!,explainlikeIAmA,ddhvlx7,7,t5_2t5iz

11064036,0,t3_5xzdfa,Alright you little Hulkamaniacs buckle up! I hope youre prepared because were taking a trip to the future by taking a trip to the past...Doom is one of the big old names in first person shooters and it dominated the field brother! For a while back there Doom Clone was what you called a first person shooter and the influence remains! Doomguy made first person shooters famous!In the opening act youre on a Martian moon in the future and brother things have gone wrong! The Union Aerospace Corporation has opened a portal to hell! Zombies and worse are running wild and they have guns! Only one human life remains. Only one Marine who fears no beast or man has survived! The Doomguy! And hes ready to seek and destroy! Seek and destroy the shotgun zombies! Seek and destroy the snotflinging hellspawn! Seek and destroy the flying skulls! And the Barons of Hell! And the Cyberdemon and the Spider Mastermind and anything else between him and victory! Except a ladder. It was the s ID Software did what they could with what they had brother. Next comes Doom  which takes the action straight to Earth and straight to Hell! All the old baddies are back and brother they brought some WEIRD backup! The zombies have machine gun support! A skeleton has rocket launcher football pads! And this weird zombie with necromantic fire is going to bring back all the monsters you killed so they can run wild on you! But Doomguy still fears no man or beast and hes got two barrels of American steel to tell them just how he feels!And then after Doomguy crushes Phobos Deimos the Head of Hell and everthing in between things go quiet for a while. Time passes. First person shooters made famous by Doomguy move on. The graphics get better the kills get bigger and brother the genre is here to stay! But Doomguy wasnt gone brother! He wasnt dead he wasnt sleeping he was waiting! Waiting for his time! Waiting for the moment to strike! Waiting for ID to stop monkeying around with Daikatana! But not all stories are happy all the way through Hulkamaniacs. Doom  was... a numbered reboot. A survival horror reboot. The fans were torn apart! The ones who wanted an oldschool s vintage run and gun felt betrayed! The ones who wanted a taste of fear and adrenaline were rewarded! Everyone wanted a better flashlight! This is a divisive subject and the Hulkster is gonna leave it at that.And then comes the real reboot! The real return to form! The real Doom ! Mars is back! Hell is back! And you better believe Doomguy is back! And like his brothers in the genre his graphics got better the kills got bigger and brother the franchise is here to stay!,explainlikeIAmA,dem3d73,18,t5_2t5iz
