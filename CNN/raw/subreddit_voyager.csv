95578,0,t3_1v6bkg,I find a lot of episodes in the season  range to have the tuvix effect.. Bad plot devices and irrelevance. I typically skip them. I feel it picks up at season .,voyager,cepb84q,3,t5_2sknh
1735975,0,t3_2c5p9j,Im guessing Year of Hell is one of the obvious ones? The acting is a notch higher than the usual episode.I also like the one where Harry and Chakotay have to stop Voyager from a disastrous slipstream experiment that destroys it and leaves its wreck buried in ice. Whats the name of that one?,voyager,cjxzfpk,3,t5_2sknh
2439288,0,t3_2nfkfs,I have to imagine that the first season of the show was pretty well mapped out. A new series brings risk so I assume they plan arcs out pretty well. Especially only  episodes in,voyager,cmd79km,2,t5_2sknh

6986608,0,t1_d187un7,I would say TNG sciencey and DS dramatic soap opera is space because when we start to talk about the Emissary of the Prophets I always compared it religion here on Earth except there its kinda true. If there were Orbs in church I might just go... Voyager personally I love all aspects  included Neelix   but then again I like Diagnosis Murder.,voyager,d189too,4,t5_2sknh
