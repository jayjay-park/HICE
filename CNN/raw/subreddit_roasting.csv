190472,0,t3_1w7nqf,Ive used both roast logger and artisan on my mac. Roast logger is cool because it has the OCR feature that can read the display of a thermometer. The downside is that it was designed to read a display that was lit with LEDs and if you just have a cheap thermometer with a nonilluminated LCD display any change in lighting ie you move and the shadow shifts will mess up the reading.Artisan has some really nice features such as roast analysis temperature spike removal auto logging the turning point after you charge your roaster etc. It also has the ability to run a program to gather temperature data and this is where it stands above the rest for Mac users who want a less expensive way to precisely measure temperature.What I did was I made my own thermometer using an arduino and a k type thermocouple. When the arduino is plugged in it just reads the temperature every  second and sends it to the computer. I then wrote another script on my mac that reads that input from the arduino and writes it to a file. Then in artisan I have it read that file. I do this roundabout way because it takes a few seconds to open serial communication between the computer and the arduino but reading a file is essentially instantaneous. ,roasting,cf04upm,1,t5_2t80t

Theres quite a range of colors in an ethiopian roast so its really hard to nail down a specific roast as roast is usually determined by color and each ethiopian bean color is slightly different.Ethiopian beans definitely chaff a lot more than other beans columbian peruvian and mexican so maybe the roast you did seemed lighter than the brazilian you roasted...?Either case keep experimenting and roasting! ,roasting,cgmchhc,1,t5_2t80t

837691,0,t1_cgzh61y,Awesome I really did enjoy that video. Very cool. Do you live there yearround? Yes Im MexiPuerto Rican   but I have live most of my life in PR and all of my family on my mother side is from PR.  Coffee has escalated quickly on my life since I bump into rCoffee . Last year I bought a Rancillio Sylvia a few months ago a Behmore and now Im visit farms around the Island to get green beans. Im loving it and Im learning a lot. gt By the way I chose  as the cutoff for large beans but I have very little experience with PR coffee so I dont know what the typical range of bean size is. I imagine if you got a few screens you could figure this out pretty quickly. Thanks I will....Most farmers have told me that Puerto Rican peaberry is really good. I bought some and it was really good   The thing is that since Im buying directly from farms I have to separate some beans by hand. Farmers in Puerto Rico pay federal minimum wages to workers and machines always let some bad beans get away. That part is usually done by hand and that is not cost effective for farmers in here to pay people to do that. Coffee in here is already kind of expensive. But its ok I kind of enjoy it and Im learning a lot from it. ,roasting,cgzhy4l,2,t5_2t80t

Heat could be gently withdrawn so that first crack occurs at  minutes with a low burner setting for the next  minutes to finish the roast at  minutes. To avoid the temperature peeling up towards the finish. I find this is a simple way to develop a roast and avoid any grassygreen characteristics.,roasting,clxrbqq,1,t5_2t80t

3462257,0,t3_2zuii4,The amount of CO formed depends on how deep you roast. It can get as high as  of the roasted bean weight. Releasing it minimizes aroma loss and oxidation. Most of its released within the first few hours after you roast and then it slows but continues for a few weeks. Valve bags are popular but glass has a better barrier and I only work with small batches that are cupped within  days. So I let them breath for an hour or two after roast and then store in small glass swingtop jars right up to the top. The lid pops right off from pressure inside. The CO is only released if it has the headspace otherwise it remains inside the beans cell walls. ,roasting,cpmx7ow,1,t5_2t80t
3463396,0,t1_cpn0j4f,The CO generated during the roast is trapped inside the bean cells because its released only when the internal pressure is lower than external. When a barrier is used like a sealed glass container the external pressure eventually becomes  higher than the internal and CO is no longer released with some of it still trapped in the cells. This is also true for the other volatiles including some aromatics which is a surely a good thing to have retained until grind. ,roasting,cpn1vqr,2,t5_2t80t

4343155,0,t3_3aoe2m,Industrial safety consultant and coffee roaster here. The fact that the recommended hour limit is in the partsperbillion range tells me that it is indeed bad stuff. The thing to recognize about these Threshold Limit Values is that they generally mean continuous exposure for an  hour day with no breaks  hours a week for  years. If youre roasting by the numbers profile graphs and temps you have good ventilation an afterburner and you maintain negative pressure in the drum at all times you wont have a lot to worry about. If youre roasting a lot by sightsmell then you are increasing your exposure.For the sake of due diligence hiring an licensed Industrial Hygienist to measure diacetyl levels is a prudent idea. Keep their report on file and ask them to come back periodically especially if your volume is growing or you upgrade to a bigger roaster. EDIT Further Control Measures.Workers involved in bulk coffee grinding operations or large scale roasting operations should be wearing halfmask style respiratory protection with combination OV Organic Vapours and P or higher filters.

I roast now on a Loring and previously on a Sivetz...so this is derived from that experience. Typically because of the convective heat transfer I tend to see LIGHTER color  less caramelization on the outside of the bean because of no inductive transfer from contact with the drum  however if you hit first crack with a lot of momentum and dont slow your rateofrise the outside of the bean will caramelize without the inside of the bean having time to catch up. This creates the spread youd see between the Agtron numbers for ground and whole bean. So basically  lower your heat maybe  degrees before first crack and keep it steady from there until the end of crack and you should get more even development through the bean.,roasting,cttlf8v,2,t5_2t80t

6419277,0,t1_czgp1wt,gtI suspect the SBDC fully expects its clients to get smart in their chosen field.Yeah a lot of business centers are less clear about this than may be appropriate but they assume and count on you achieving mastery within your field but expect youll need support on the doing business things side.  Theres a lot of lurk moar culture especially in business circles like that.  They expect you to knowingly shoulder the burden of coming up to speed in the industry you want to enter.  Which is a great way of approaching it but really should be made more explicit.  gtHis first comment was why would the customer buy beans from you and not me? I get his point. And you are furthering along his point but with more eloquence.Jesus.  Fellas subtle like a sledgehammer to the face with a vuvuzela chorus.  But yeah you do need a way to differentiate yourself from the competition and doing so on coffee quality alone is often also how theyre trying to differentiate themselves from you so youre both saying the same thing about your own brand and coffees ... and the consumer gets lost in the middle.  Essentially remember that everything you do in public or in the consumers eye is an opportunity to communicate who you are and what makes you special and distinctive.  Making sure you have a cohesive intentional and consistent message is really key to having an identity that can differentiate a business selling undifferentiated products.  gtAre you referring to people in the industry? Say George Howell for instance? Or organizations that have large footprints? Like Intelligentsia or BB? Will you names names?Yes to both.  Mostly businesses or people that are able to sustain themselves almost exclusively from within the craft coffee marketplace and are respected enough by the rest of the marketplace to stand as opinion leaders.  So in terms of big names offhand its mostly a list of people I also happen to look up to tbh.   Howell Carmichael Perger Cho Hoffmann and Rao.  Theres more if I put time into figuring out whos So Hot Right Now but enough to get the idea I hope?  Mostly theres interplay amongst them and back and forth but theyre also providing knowledge and leadership to the rest of us.  Trends come and go largely from them or from things that theyve picked up from us and then endorsed or decried publicly. gt I also ordered Rob Hooss new book Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee One Roasters Manifesto.Let me know how that is.  The boss has been talking about buying it but has not pulled the trigger yet.  Ive heard good things but not many things.  gtWould you recommend roasting this single bag on my current home roaster setup? Or would you recommend learning on a gas roaster like a  kilo USRC? NOTE I currently do not own a gas roaster.I would recommend as much of your practice as is feasible on the machine you intend to use but if a KG batch size is a little silly large while starting out it may be worthwhile to get theory figured out and experimented with on something smaller.  Minimum batch size may in fact be more reasonable and doing small batches on a KG is probably more useful practice than doing them on an entirely different machine.  Learning to roast on a given machine is like driving a standard clutch  you can get the general idea from driving any standard car the more standards youve drove the easier you have learning any individual new one  but each is still a little different in ways you kinda have to learn specific to the hardware itself.  gt should I now invest several thousand dollars in this venture proper roaster space afterburner permits licenses bags etc.?Im less sure of that.  Im used to a marketplace where real estate is insane expensive so I generally advise locals to avoid shelling out for space until the last possible minute.  But if youd have to move all your setup and shell out for the moving and deset and resetup ... it may be worthwhile to just have a space to work from regardless.  Its honestly pretty hard to say.  My very vague advice kinda depends mostly on the setup of your rig.  If you can set it up in your garage or whatever Id pull the trigger on the rig and get learnin while shopping for a good location.  Once you have that make the move as soon as you can.  Drawing traffic and curious lookielous while youre learning is a good way to build hype and build others investment in your business.   If its way too much hassle to setup elsewhere and then move start hunting a space once youre set there get your rig ordered ... but still if at all possible try and keep your existing source of income to fund the learning process.  ,roasting,czjafvm,2,t5_2t80t

7959722,0,t1_d4apnqp,Well I thought the extra cost was warranted and Im roasting a lot less than  lbsweek. I cant say if the extra cost is worth it to you. I think either way youre going to have a lot of trouble paying for your roaster by selling lbsweek. Even if nothing goes wrong and every single roast is perfect and sells youre looking at several years to just pay for the roaster not including your time. Are you sure that this is about economics? If you can just admit to yourself that its a hobby then you are free from needing to amortize the cost of a roaster. Just my two cents.Here are my Sumatra roast profiles I tried a couple different things and as I said initial tasting was promising. Will know more over the next few days.,roasting,d4aqxj1,5,t5_2t80t
8000149,0,t1_d4e5rai,Youre referring to icing.

8090110,0,t1_d4oxchp,Ah good question.  What Id say is Taste a lot of stuff.  With the ability to identify flavors in your food and drink you will also develop the confidence to call out obvious stuff in your coffee. Taste with friends or professionals.  Some shops offer public cupping sessions like Blue Bottle.  And on some forums theyll do a sort of coffeeofthemonth thing where everyone compares tasting notes.  HomeBarista used to be good for that and hukyforum is good for it. Use a sort of Socratic method when you taste.  Youll never start with the specific flavors.  I usually go down the path of something like this tastes fruity.  What kind of fruit?  Apples?  No.  Tropical fruit?  No.  Citrus fruit?  Yes.  What kind of ctrus?  Oranges?  No more complex than oranges.  Grapefruit?  No sweeter than that.  Whats more complex than an orange but sweeter than a grapefruit?  Maybe a tangerine?  Yeah!  Tangerine.As an aside beer is a whole other thing.  I also happen to home brew.  So one thing  malt is the same as grain mostly.  There is some grain that is not malt but I dont want to get into that.  All beer is brewed with mostly malted grain.  Malted simply means that the grain was fooled into germinating.  The grain has lots of carbohydrates in it and they need to be broken down into sugar somehow.  When grain germinates it releases a bunch of enzymes that convert starch into sugar.  So we fool the grain into germinating so we can use those enzymes ourselves.  The process is called malting the grain.So maltgrain directly contributes to a sort of pleasant breadiness sometimes accompanied by a thicker mouthfeel.  Lots of german beers and English beers will have this quality.When you taste a new beer I recommend going to a site like RateBeer or BeerAdvocate.  Lots of people discussing the flavor profile of every beer on those sites.  Also if you want to know the grain or hop profile of a beer type into google name of beer  clone.  Home brewers love to try and clone beers they like so youll see all sorts of attempts at guessing how a beer was made. Oh also one last thing.  If you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes Id recommend cutting back your sugar intake.  Sugar burns out your palate.  I personally cant drink soda anymore because its way too sweet.  But as I went off of sugary stuff I found I was much better able to pick up on other flavors.,roasting,d4pehpb,2,t5_2t80t

I started with a plastic one but I dont think this was a great idea.I stir the beans while I am roasting with a bread maker in dough mixing mode.At the beginning of the roast while the moisture level is high you can use higher heathold the gun closer to the beans because the escaping moisture has a cooling effect but as they dry you need to back off.  The color smell smoke and sound all inform your technique with practice.I usually roast a lb at a time.Different beans require different roast levels and techniques.

9330937,0,t1_d8ypoky,Not that there is no difference. There can be great differences but if you mean between two roasters which are essentially the same. Marketing  sale is enough to sustain the production and distribution of many models when they cost a few hundred dollars max to make and ship and sell for  dollars. You see the same thing in the highend writing tools world. And like that world youll see this one will fall sooner rather than later.. Reputation Just like with the writing tools world the only important difference between a  for a dozen bic and a  for a single cross is the price. Pick up a piece of paper look at the handwriting on it and tell me which pen wrote it. Betcha cant. Same thing for the roaster that made your coffee. Maybe you can tell the origin of the bean or the roast profile but youll never be able to tell me the machine. This was really driven home when Dunkin Donuts won so many taste competitions. AND when I had ROBUSTA that was pan roasted and was mellower than some arabicas Id cupped!. Industry Fixing the coffee industrys incentives are to create a barrier to entry. Green coffee is exceptionally cheap and roasted coffee is exceptionally expensive in comparison  its worth what youll pay for it really but theres no reason for that if youre willing to roast it yourself. Sure roasting is a skill. But its a skill measured in a subjective scale Taste. Theres famously no accounting for it yeah? But when a good or professional roaster costs a lot of money it means you have to invest quite a lot to produce enough roasted coffee to make the economics of buying green coffee make sense. Thus a professional roaster doesnt have to worry about you imperiling his relationships or challenging his local supremacy or simply bringing the price down locally. Never forget coffee is a huge commodity prone to violent price fluctuations.. Customer Service Some companies like Probat do offer really good customer service. Their outlets offer training and warranties and repair services just like if you were buying a car. Theyre a really great company as are many other coffee industry companies. Coffee is very much a business of relationships and so it tends to attract good people who want to do good things Nestle and Kraft et. al. not withstanding and it does take money to maintain that sort of professional service. The cheaper companies dont view their customers as that sort of a long term relationship and so they do lose bigger clients that way.. Write Offs Insurance tax write offs and etc. can actually mean a more expensive machine can end up costing a company less than a cheaper one. Creative accounting leasing or allowing a private contractor own the machine while you use it and he files it as a business expense can mean a  machine costs you  a year while a  machine costs you  in replacement parts that you have to install yourself. There are probably more reasons I dont know but the only other one I can think of is industry entrenchment. When a chain of coffee shops own your machines you can not only claim it as a selling point but also use that capital against your competition. A chain wont use multiple brands for many more reason I wont go into here. My fingers are getting tired.,roasting,d8yrj2w,0,t5_2t80t

Simply because you dip after FC rise up dip again rise up again.  The first dip and rise isnt too bad.  But the nd rise after FCends you need to figure a way to cut heat or energy somehow so that the bean temp just tapers off until roast end.  All I can say is try it every roaster is different.  My other primary hobby is Brazilian jiu jitsu Ive been doing it  years.  BJJ like roasting is hard  the only way to get better is to keep doing it.  The thing that really frustrates me about roasting is there isnt immediate feedback on experiments or theories.  In jiu jitsu I can test and play with so many things and get good feedback.  On the other hand you really cant get lucky in jiu jitsu youve either put the time in or you havent.  I believe in roasting you can actaually get lucky and hit one out of the park.  Additionally for a home roaster you can only do so many roasts.  FOr me it becomes veryyyyy frustrating at times.  Another part of the frustration is roast theory seems to be SO DEPENDENT upon the actual roaster youre using.  What works in my huky will likely be different than your hottop or you gas roaster.  I think roasting into near nd crack like youre doing is much less frustrating as you still get very good chocolatey crowd pleasing coffee.  Dropping coffee right around the end of first crack trying to pull out fruit florals without acidity or flatness taking over those roasts...grrrr theyre very tough to nail.

11472117,0,t3_62i3fu,Coffee beans are irregular spheres. Conduction heat is based on contact and contact on a sphere is always going to be a small area of surface. Convection heat is going to more evenly heat an irregular surface so overall you can expect more even heat penetration from the outside of the outside of the bean to the inside. In theory convection heat should provide better results but you dont cook a steak by hanging it in an air column so obviously theres more going on than simply transferring from the outside to the inside. If you think about the chemical reactions going on inside those beans it seems there is a synergy from the chaos of conductive heat penetrating the shell in a less than uniform manner. Some areas of the bean get more excited and the chemical reactions happen to a greater degree providing compounds that can then react with sugars and proteins that havent advanced as far along in the chemical transformation. Its this unevenness that creates the complexity of flavor in coffee. and probably explains why convection roasting results in beans with more clarity in flavor but less complexity.,roasting,dfwcxwa,2,t5_2t80t
