319252,0,t1_cfdtrtd,gt Androids whole selling point over iOS is how its open and not locked down and actually gives you options for things like design and functionality and id like them to not have every single device do the three button layout.It certainly gives OEMs and carriers that freedom Im stuck with a terrible layout if I buy a phone with bad hardware keys.gtI dont really care for it honestly. Its not for me. I never said anything about objectivity. I used the phrase me personally and my personal use as many times as i did very much on purpose.Look I get that you dont care and thats fine. Im glad youre happy and I get that you might not use the multitasking button often which is easily the best button out of the three enough to warrant it as a key. I just took issue with you saying you prefered the two button set up. Its bizarre to prefer something that is objectively a loss of functionality. gt  Im not going to argue with you about what is objectively better because neither one is objectively better. There is no objectivity when it comes to this.Thats just not true. Less functionality is objectively worse. Especially when the functionality that is removed is a huge advantage and feature of the OS Multitasking. gt Its always been about preference and what an individual is used to and you seem smart enough to realize that you only think your way is objectively better because its YOUR way and what YOU are used to.I dont think my way Its not my way is objectively better. I think that removing a critical feature from an OS designed around that feature is a bad thing. You could make a device with one button only and everything tied to it. That wouldnt be better than one with all the buttons and features.Ive typed a lot more about this than I thought I would and thankfully it seems that HTC is going the right direction with the M so they obviously learned something. Either way Im not saying youre wrong or dumb or anything but removing a button and then tying  functions to a button to replicate the functionality you just removed is bizarre. ,htcone,cfduyll,1,t5_2txx2

630169,0,t3_21cp0c,Thanks for the AMA.Few dumb personal questions.  Im a current Galaxy S user thats been boned by verizon and samsung with the botched . update.  Ive been waiting to decide between the  phones and I almost walked out of the store today with an M.  Is the HTC software experience a lot more fluid than the TouchWiz of Samsung?  I really have no experience with HTC phones and am more than willing to make the switch as long as they support their phones with updates and dont release half baked ones like Samsung has been doing lately.  I like the overall look and customization options that the HTC interface offers but having used the phone do you REALLY notice them and do you think youll use them and customize them or will they just be options that sit there and never get touched like most of the lame and half functioning widgets that the Samsung TouchWiz interface offers?,htcone,cgbwfys,0,t5_2txx2

749984,0,t3_22qyt5,Try typing asteriskasteriskasteriskasterisk into your dialer or phone app. Should pull up a menu. Then if youre on sprint or Verizon tap CDMA only or CDMA auto I forget. If youre on ATampT or TMobile tap  GSM only or GSM auto again I forget. If youre on ATampT or TMO it will do HSPA but pretty much G.   Edit Lemme know if it works. I did that same trick on my thunderbolt and my one both sense and stock android. I will say though unless you live in an area where LTE is spotty you wont see any battery improvement if thats what youre shooting for. The LTE radio takes up about as much power as GHSPA. What drains the power is if your radio has to constantly switch between LTE and G like areas with spotty LTE coverage.,htcone,cgpj2x3,1,t5_2txx2

Sense  inst bad although I use nova launcher because I like my customization. The s for me was laggy and I didnt like the interface of touchwiz. The phone feels nice and is slim although build quality isnt a priority for me. The s actually felt nicer to hold in my opinion and less likely to slip from the hand. The camera is.. acceptable. Its fine for uploading your pictures to Instagram selfies and the occasional picture of your cat which is mainly what I think a smartphone camera is intended for. The duo cam features are a cool thing to show to friends although Ive never had a need to actually use them. IF you want an amazing camera buy an actual camera. Remember your phone is a phone with a camera on it not a camera with a phone on it. The gestures are a really nice touch I love just unlocking the screen by just swiping and i always keep the default lock screen as ive found rd party ones arent that smooth the m has shortcuts and gesture support where others dont. However it does lack the ability to use your own widget as the main lock screen widget. ,htcone,chx55zt,1,t5_2txx2

1277665,0,t3_28q02w,What you are seeing is elastooptic effect or Birefringence It used to be utilize for checking for mechanical stress inside objects before we got fancy computer technologies. Nice youtube video showing stress inside gears hereSo what happens exactly? You have polarized light from LCD and you have polarized glasses. As you said at certain angle you see no artifacts because the polarization of the screen matches the polarization of your glasses. If you rotate  degrees you should see most artifacts and after another  degrees you should be back to no artifacts. It is a little bit more complex on smartphone screens works best on simple LCD displays like in digital watches.Now plastics have something called birefringence. They twist lights polarization. The amount of twist is a function of material properties thickness and mechanical stress thats why patters change on the youtube video. You are seeing stress in the plastic screen protector! Make an experiment  collect transparent plastic stuff around your house. Display mostly white website reddit will do put on your glasses and take some of the plastic stuff so you see reddit though it. Voila awesome stress inside plastic! You should see spots when the injection moulding started etc.But to the point  which screen protector will be the best? You already figured out thickness. Thinner the better. Also notice the material. Although nobody will provide you relevant properties  glass should give very few to none artifacts. So there you go aim for screen protector made out of glass  they are expensive though and hard to find for M...,htcone,cidcs3z,4,t5_2txx2

Good all around it will be hard to be disappointed but it will also be difficult to get a truly WOW shot.Cons  Lacking good manual controls Sony Xperia Z Pros  Excellent resolution Good Color Good Accuracy Good manual features.Cons  Meh low light performance Software is slow lack of OIS really kills the camera  inclusion of OIS would likely make Sony the best.There you have it a balanced assessment of each Flagships camera.

1972492,0,t3_2h9u6w,Youre giving up a hell of a lot if you go from the G to the M. Your only gain is the speakers build quality and the better Android skin. Thats literally it. The G has a better camera better processor significantly better battery life I cant understate that the M and Nexus  have comparable battery life with the M taking a slight edge and a bigger screen . vs .. The G and the M are nearidentical in size by the way. So I wouldnt say its a good idea at all. The G is plasticy sure but when you use a case does it really matter that much?I got my G in December. I liked it a lot but it got water damaged so part of the touchscreen digitizer had a dead zone. Didnt make the phone unusable but another line on my plan had an upgrade they didnt want to use so I used the upgrade to get an M in July. I love the M more as a device than I ever did the G Ill tell you that much. But sometimes I miss the screentobezel ratio Ill take the awesome frontfacing speakers over it but damn was the front of the G pretty. Anyone correct me if Im wrong but the G and Ms battery life is pretty comparable M usually a little longer depending on use and the G still has a slight edge over the Ms camera in everything but lowlight conditions. The M is significantly taller of a device than the G width is almost identical I dont have the biggest hands but it didnt make that much of a difference for me. The silicon in the M is slightly faster too.At the end of the day I love my M to death the build and sound quality is thoroughly premium and every other spec about it is certainly competitive with all the other flagships. The G makes up for its plasticky ugly back by being a totally solid device in all other departments and easily coverable with a case. Theyre both great phones. The M was great for its time and kickstarted a broader trend between manufacturers to make premium Android phones inside and out. Anyone that has one today really isnt behind the curve by much but it simply isnt the better choice when you already have a G.So tldr G to M is a pretty bad idea and if you really need the better build quality and speakers go for the M even though its bigger. If I were you Id stick with the G until the M which is what I would have done had I not broken my G.Check this link out it shows the size comparison between the phones and you can make it exactly to scale using the calibration tool.,htcone,ckqvwft,4,t5_2txx2

2359564,0,t1_cm3c6z2,This would definitely be ideal but it depends on the Sense framework to function. In KitKat and earlier you had to do some serious low level modification to change the way pictures turned out  by the time you get to the API level which is where you need to be to make an app that will work with phones not built with your lowlevel modifications the picture has already been captured and processed by the poorly optimized Google software.The potentially good news is that the Camera API allows for both manual camera controls AND raw image capture. This will allow third parties to use built in APIs to optimize both the capture and processing stages of the photography process which should be all HTC needs to support their camera app. I would imagine that they will use this approach in the future as using a prebaked API is much faster and easier than having to build it from scratch and should provide the same results. Hopefully this will result in us seeing the HTC camera separated from the Sense framework. If nothing else an HTC camera app built in this manner will likely be much easier for third party devs to port over to the GPE.Even if this doesnt happen third party camera apps are about to get a WHOLE lot better. I really feel as though this is going to be the push that the community needs to finally start beating Apple in the mobile photography department.,htcone,cm3cpkl,2,t5_2txx2

2953720,0,t1_co3ij6x,Actually looking at the title of the thread if you are still on stock ROM with an unlocked bootloader I think you just need to relock your bootloader and youre ready. You shouldnt lose data and once the OTA rolls out it should work. So I would do that and update the phone right now to the latest KK version available from your carrier.Getting SOff to go back to stock is not necessary. Maybe if you converted it to a GPE but even then Im not sure. However I cant comment on this as I never was interested in doing this so I didnt do research on converting it to GPE.The safest way to go back to  stock is to just use an RUU in my opinion.I learned this the hard way but always do a backup of your phone with stock everything save it on your computer and the next time you have to go back to stock you just flash the backup from TWRP or CWM and youre done. No hunting for RUUs or a stock backup especially when your stuff is carrier branded.,htcone,co3uopa,1,t5_2txx2

Initial chat with CS took quite a while since every question I had needed to go to the manager. Finally he said that the repair team would try to charge me but just let them know that customer service said it was free and theyd waive it. They sent me a prepaid shipping label which was nice. As told earlier once HTC received the phone they quoted me  for the repair. I told them that CS said it would be waived. They never responded that which irritated me. I waited several days after that and the next thing I heard it was shipping back to me. I didnt get charged or anything but they also never told me that it actually got fixed. From drop off to delivery the whole process took like  weeks. I have an m now so Im just fixing my m for resale. Package was very well wrapped. Looks like they fixed the gap on the top speaker grill but cut a very small but noticeable slot assuming thats to get into the phone.

4923336,0,t3_3ibauf,. Not specifically a Cydia alternative but FDroid and Xposed work similarly in terms of being able to install tweaks to your device under the same notion as Cydia most of the tweaksapps you can install via FDroid and Xposed are not available on Google Play or theyre just opened source and are available in both Google Play as well as FDroid such as Tinfoil for Facebook. Xposed is more like Cydia in the sense that its just tweaks such as Sense Toolbox which youll probably want to get when you root your M. . Very close to it. Instead of using Winterboard I miss it dearly... we use Launchers namely Nova Launcher to do a lot of customizations in terms of home screen and some parts of the UI. SenseToolbox allows you to manage other aspects of the UI. However Sense Toolbox only applies to Sense ROMs. If you choose to go AOSP with something like BlissPOP DoppelKanger or CyanogenMod they usually include their own little tweaking system for customization without having to download additional appstweaks to do so. If you choose to flash a GPE ROM you can use GravityBox which in my opinion offers slightly more flexibility and customization than Sense Toolbox due to the limitations of what you can or cant edit for Sense. . Best to unlock it as a Verizon M. I dont delve too far into basebands and device firmwares but to my knowledge firmwares are exclusive to different regions so different methods of root are used. Much like how you cant restore say an iPhone firmware on an iPhone  being USCDMA and  being internationalChina. Theyre considered  different devices much like variants of the M.. KingRoot and Sunshine are your only means of rooting and SOFFing your verizon M on Lollipop. Itll run you  to do so paid during the Sunshine portion of the procedure. . Recommendations in terms of apps would be Nova Launcher theres a free and pro version the free version does a lot but the pro version is definitely a worthwhile investment does not require root Bluelight Filter if youve used F.lux before this is only temporary until F.lux finally gets around to releasing their native Android version does not require root ES File Explorer particularly if you do get rootSOFF analogous to FilzaiFile in terms of kickassness does not require root but root is recommended AdAwayMinMinGuard adblockers that you can get from FDroid and Xposed Installer respectively requires that youve rooted first Zooper Widget Pro if youre into Cydget and all or whatever they use nowadays you can do very much the same with Zooper does not require root KLWP Kustom Live Wallpaper is very similar to Cydget but is a lot cleaner in my opinion and offers a lot more flexibility and versatility in how you can theme your homescreen does not require root and Flashify requires root this allows you to flash ZIPs and imgs via scripts so itll boot into your recovery for you and proceed to flash packages in sequence so that you dont have to manually queue them and if you ever need to reflash a custom recovery for whatever reason you can use this to download and flash for you in a single goIn terms of theming Id recommend rAndroidThemes which parallels iOSThemes if youre into theming.,htcone,cuf4idq,1,t5_2txx2

Im sure there are guides out there but this gives me something to look for. Thanks for your help.Another question. Say I get this kernel which works for cm am I correct that it wont be write protected like the TMobiles which came on the phone? Meaning Ill be able to root and it will stick? Not that Ill be trying to root again for awhile. My first goal was mainly to get the updated CM.,htcone,cvzm0u1,1,t5_2txx2
