31984,0,t3_1tsdod,This is an agreeable and muchneeded variation on the more widely seen Crispy Hexagons. The packaging is much more modernlooking than most Crispy Hexagon variants and the addition of the stylized hexagonal elements in particular really raises the bar for all hexagonal Chexknockoff cereal branding going forward I think. I agree the bowl is sort of out of place though  a round bowl I would accept and even agree with but the choice of an octagon in this context is downright bizarre.,hexagons,cei2n0i,2,t5_2s58o
