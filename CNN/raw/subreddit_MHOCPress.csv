If you have an issue with his stance on womens liberation you should have informed the Central Committee to have a vote for him to be removed from the party. usolidblues  does not own the Womens Caucus the Party does.I did message you after your resignation stating you are in the right to have the seat and you could have it what usolidblues says about the seat is irrelevant. Though you evidently failed to respond and proceed to post this. Your actions are immature and reactive. This could have been a nonissue but you have chosen to turn it into a scandal. You shouldnt have insulted him instead asked him to leave you alone. You swore an oath as a member of the CC to not engage in uncomradely behaviour which both you and usolidblues have violated.There have not been a series of incidents. That one issue with the abortion was solved and if I recall correctly that member was made to rescind and delete their statements after you complained. In addition that member is not particularly active and as I have said one member is not the party. You could have brought it up to the CC to have that member removed but you didnt so we didnt do anything about it.

3616054,0,t1_cq4cs3m,the railways act obviously will have given people more income and was part of what caused people to have more spending money while combined with the increased income from National Insurance being amended. However the exact ticket changes in price i cannot specify as like i said in the system explanation thread i am not simulating individual industries.The changes due to B are not again part of my job so i cannot tell you if that has increased or decreased the burden on the NHS i cant even tell you what that burden is all i can tell you is the general running costs for the NHS have been maintained which does not directly correlate towards the burden on the service.Again i am not managing individual industry changes however the lowering of investment in other sources of energy will have placed a minor strain on the industry in those sectors and will have increased industry investment towards nuclear. This however wont make much immediate change as nuclear power stations take a long time to construct and currently in the UK we have a significant lack of nuclear engineers thus meaning very little change would have occurred. But again this i do not specify.As per B which completely changed the tax system there were several major changes. Notably the introduction of land tax effectively cut the Government out as a middle man by giving councils the income of that tax directly thus lowering the costs and income of the govt which effectively nullified itself. This bill also created the wealth tax which creates an annual income of . at this time as what you call a wealth tax is really more of a mansion tax. The major change however as i mentioned in other posts is the removal of NI which effectively increased the public spending power by a significant amount which was handled by changing public incomes in the spreadsheet but also affected the changes in income tax which as per my calculations now has a minor increase in income as per this bill.B  again like before i dont handle individual markets however i would highly doubt the nationalisation of said air traffic control systems would cost the Government much and the costs were factored into the Governments general economic costs. i agree there is a lot of vital economic work in air traffic however for now this area is not being simulated saying this i do intend to expand the spreadsheet at a later date to include all state run businesses. as for airport traffic i would suggest very little real change due to likely maintained standards from continued staff contracts and little real economic growth to suggest a major increase in air traffic.B  again i dont do specific industries as of this moment and plan to expand later. you must understand that this is highly detailed work that would have to be created and considering i have made this spreadsheet in  days other effects will take a bit longer to introduce.B  Interestingly i cant actually find the imposition of any tax whatsoever as per B meaning as stated in the spreadsheet if you cared to actually look there has been precisely  income except from VAT which has been applied accordingly and has increased VAT income. The effects of cannabis on the workplace has also been accounted for as a minor change in GDP growth resulting in a small loss of productivity. The introduction of cannabis into the market however accounted for an input of bn into the economy. B  again i dont look into the exact changes of the NHS and plan to expand on this later however the effects of that would most likely be delayed by a matter of months or even years as the NHS adapts to meet the new demands and as the public healthcare systems gradually improve. Health like education is an economic effect that takes hold over time not immediately.B  again you only just made this bill a matter of months ago and the effects would not even be slightly visible yet apart from a small drop in youth unemployment which was accounted for in the recent economic update which showed a . drop in overall unemployment in a month which is actually rather good.B  again public companies are not yet simulated and honestly i had missed that tax due to reading it at something like am i shall place the effects into the spreadsheet and update the first post i made for the article to show the new deficit.As the statistics were taken from real life data the effects of the EU have been accounted for however the effects of past governments being in place have not as this would require possibly days more of backlogging of data. I am starting the data collection from today not simulating from months ago when i was not here to judge the effects of these governments.these were decided by me and approved by the speakers as executives of the forum therefore approving the assumptions i have made.,MHOCPress,cq4gfk5,1,t5_33voa

Contrary to popular belief during the Midlands Incident they did not wield tasersI believe uSpudgunn has a nice piece of evidence to the contrarygt Considering that the previous Government would sooner maim the people than help them the necessity of the Red Brigades has long been proven.No we would rather not have several groups all out on the street interfering with the effort to get the scum who started to loot and riot back under control.gt With M Her Majestys Most Reactionary Opposition seeks to criminalize local and grass roots humanitarianism. No we just want to enforce current laws we are not actually making anything illegal just enforcing the current laws.gt and as such have no grounds for calling into question the legality of the Red Brigades.It is every citizens duty to remain vigilant against crime and to report it to the local authorities when it is suspected of occurring.gt save for a proposed budget that was prematurely released to the PressBy your acting leader and the Commissioner of your little group no less.  gt We call on the Opposition to end their attacks on the people both direct and indirect and for the rest of the House to reject the Oppositions antipeople politics.You do not represent the people stop pretending you are their representative.

I also think our structure creates an effective party democracy while also maintaining the partys mobility in outside matters by relying more on debate and discussion allowing all members to voice their concerns without having to go through a slow voting process on every single matter a process that can lead to a lack of mobility on certain matters as shown by recent Communist DNVs.Side note I think both the Greens and the Communists are great and I do commend the Communists commitment to democracy.

Electoral reform is both an meta and in game issue. Therefore the proposed new electoral system is both in game and meta and regardless the speakership team is elected by the membership and doesnt have unlimited powers to intervene in game and suppress articles or opinion polls when it feels it should.This has been terribly handled.  ,MHOCPress,cyqkqkz,3,t5_33voa
6187787,0,t3_40bjmn,gtBut this cannot just be a problem for my party. Some of the big hitters of all parties can be found in the Lords. Duncs and Banter from UKIP Demon and JackWilfred from the Liberal Democrats the OllieSimmonds Guard from the Tories. I will take this as the only complement ill ever get from you PgtIt might just be that I am getting involved less but there seems to be numerous faces on MHoC who I simply dont recognise.Think how i feel after coming back after  months. All of a sudden most of the people i know either arent active or have become independents. And there are a ton of new people who i dont have a fucking clue who they are who all weirdly know me and who get really angry when i ask who they are.On your actual point i generally agree. Although i like having the lordship since i dont need to bother to stand for election. I would agree that the lords does seem to contribute to the decline of the old guard. And with the obvious exception of JellyTom since i know him personally there are a great deal of new senior people who just dont have the same ferocity as the old days. I know it sounds bad but the RSP doesnt have the same hate ability unreasonable and unrelenting jingoism that the CP had and its less fun. I miss the plotting to kill bills and it being seriously hard and the drama and the secrets that used to go on. The place has defiantly become less fun that it was back in the day.I guess for me it might be different due to how ive started to act differently to how i did in the early days... something that has lead to a decline in goodwill towards me. ,MHOCPress,cyszism,1,t5_33voa

6328458,0,t1_cz8yuzv,gtI find often when people claim scientific consensus they are often being fickle with the truth.You can think what you want. Consensus is a key component of the scientific method.gtthe point is that a field such as psychology yields significantly more positive results compared the natural sciences. Which proves nothing other than social sciences being less likely to publish negative results which is a problem across all sciences.gtie that the social sciences should be completely disregarded and never brought up in another conversation ever again.Talk about giant leaps of logic! Almost all of your quotes apply both to social AND physical sciences  maybe not to the same degree but certainly to a significant level. A hierarchy of sciences refers only to complexity and not to scientific rigour hypothesis formation is irrelevant to actual tested and empirical theory confirmation bias is a problem which exists across all sciences and indeed features heavily in my next essay  the entire concept of a hypothesis ascending to theory status is of course flexible but becomes less flexible with reproduced results and more varied experiment  additional bias is indeed a problem but again bias can be weeded out with more scrutiny and indeed is weeded out with more scrutiny and the act of falsifying research is irrelevant to your attack on social sciences since it occurs in all sciences to some degree.That you might want to discount entire fields with statistically significant predictive power proving their credentials as this paper already does as scientific perhaps suggests something about your own unwillingness to accept what you might perceive as uncomfortable truths.,MHOCPress,cz8z5q1,3,t5_33voa

The policy differences. While partners in a coalition will not agree on everything the gulf between recent NUP policies and UKIP policies has grown to the extent that we are unable to find much to agree on. With the Conservatives while we may differ on social issues we can agree on the need for fiscal conservatism. With the National Unionists they openly proclaim we are neither economically nor socially libertarian leaving very little overlap to work with. Even on the EU one of the areas where we both agree we must leave the EU the deals we want to seek are very different. The way the NUPNationalists have traditionally acted in negotiations. As far back as the Nationalist Party and the th Government the NatsNUP have taken a very unworkable approach to negotiations. They set out unworkable red lines and refuse to budge from them like demanding UKIP and the Liberals voting No on a Senate amp Secularisation then when a deal cannot be reached they blame it on us. Alternatively they will start with extreme demands again but even with negotiation they are still unwilling to get to a place where both parties can agree. For any workable coalition the NUP need to drastically change their negotiating tactics. . Previous treatment of UKIP by farright organisations. Due to our troubled past with the farright we understandably have to be cautious when working with them and many still oppose it due to issues such as dupegate where Vanguard dupes swung a UKIP Leadership Election MakeTheLibertariansUKIPAgain where the Nationalists got chan pol folk to join the party in an attempt to coup the Leadership and our general history of being used as farright puppets. Even if the National Unionists claim they do not support these actions there is still a great deal of suspicion and mistrust of the farright in UKIP something the NUP have done little to remedy. ,MHOCPress,dcrpria,2,t5_33voa
