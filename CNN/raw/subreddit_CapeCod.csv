1823924,0,t3_2felct,The Chatham Fish Pier has a place to get fresh seafood also fried to eat. Since the fishing boats come in there it is wicked good and definitely fresh. Plus theres always lots of seals around waiting for scraps from the boats!Also Sesuit Harbor Cafe in Dennis has great seafood!

3879110,0,t3_34qstq,Traffic into and out of Eastham can suck.There are a lot of local radio stations that are based in Hyannis. There are a few TV channels most of them local access. I recommend you stay out of Mashpee and Falmouth just due to the trip to Eastham from sand which shes looking at a  minute commute. I recommend getting in touch with quantum and cape cod broadcasting to see if there are any openings and if there are look for housing in Yarmouth or Dennis. I can recommend a good realtor if you want to shoot me a pm.,CapeCod,cqygaj7,2,t5_2s0ex
