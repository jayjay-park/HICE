289725,0,t1_cfarop6,I had a lot of this written out before today thank god but pretty much everything I added was probably stuffed.Time FramesOrginally I had it that this is the minimum amount of time a member had to serve to in order for them to be eligible to rank up. For example someone coming from the Trainee rank to the member rank would have served already  months therefore they would have only needed to serve and additional  months to be eligible for the rank of veteran  months total. Having had sometime to think about it a minimum requirement of time spent is probably more logical. For example for a Trainee to become a member they would have needed to serve between    months as a trainee before they are eligible to apply for the member rank. This one is not set in stone. This is one area I think definitely needs a bit more tweaking.Rank VotingAgreed the rank above will vote for the rank below. Ill add it to the list under promotions.VerificationAs noted with uStelith I agree. Ill change that.Officer SystemAgreed the ones I provided were only examples.TyposMy brain it hurts but I am surprised that its only a few.Cheers I dont know what all Moscowd out means but Im going to assume it has something to do with Vodka or Tetris blocks.,southerncrossalliance,cfasm5k,1,t5_2xw6a

3680386,0,t3_32iq0p,Ok first off I dont think well ever be launching a single Gladiator from a Javelin the hangar is for VTOL we are more likely to see a Redeemer or Vanguard launch from the Javelin or maybe  x P depends how good they end up being in a short ranged dogfight. What we are more likely to see however is Gladiators and other fighter types being launched from one of the Idris... latest rumors Ive heard are  Hornet sized ships and talk has even mentioned a Retaliator and cutlass in the mix although I think Retaliator may be a pipe dream unless they need to be able to land a Rataliator in the Idris for SQ.Should you melt you Retaliator for a Gladiator tough call.. If your Retaliator has LTI then you may find selling it on the grey market is a better option. than merely melting it. I know LTI is supposed to be negligible but its a safety net. Other than LTI issue Id say get what you feel best suites your play style.  On the Org front I do own  Retaliators and  Gladiators in my pledge so unless we really want an entire wing of either I imagine wed have several options.Although what ever you take we need nose art of Scrooge McDuck surrounded with piles of Money and the name Lucky Duck for your ship. Which I may add would suite the Retaliator more given the linage with WWII bombers.Tough call though... although remember Gladiator is limited like the SH which is why I have  in my pledge. This means it wont always be available in REC. Second your Retaliator would still be linked to your account if you melted it... and you would be able to get it redeemed if you had the required credits in your account.Personally I think you need to catch them all or as many ships as possible not sure whether Ill be able to keep it up... a little a week is O.K but does become really insanely scary when I look at the totals... So ultimate advice dont over stress it At present I at least have multiples of both ships and cant fly them all. I imagine they will be leased to the Org members as needed. Second in light of the above get what fits best for you though i advocate getting whatever you can that gives you the most variation.. Carrack and Tali go cross over more those the torps in the Tali dwarf the size s in the the Gladiators belly. Finally while advocating getting everything you can I strongly advise   I highly not looking at that the totals in the billings page..,southerncrossalliance,cqbsdp7,2,t5_2xw6a

5223344,0,t1_cvfk4ku,Pretty much. Weve been told we will be able to make things Org owned... but we dont know the details. Tuesday will give us a better idea for the Endeavour minimum crew requirements.But we do know both Idris and Javelin do require a group of players to be effective. And we do know the Idris can keep at least  hornetGladiators flight ready... so it functions like a pocket carrier  Sorry cant tell you what we dont know,southerncrossalliance,cvfls1e,1,t5_2xw6a
