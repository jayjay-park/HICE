3190263,0,t1_cosdvgw,I understand what you mean. The Church has a history of teaching the theologically unclear limbo of the infants. Here is I think the most recent document discussing the theological idea. The TLDR is that we can as Catholics have hope that God takes each of his human creations who die prematurely without being baptized especially those children whose parents were intending their child to be raised in a Christian home. We cannot be certain but we can hope.This means that we should not cease praying for them. If I were in your shoes I might arrange my intentions during prayer with the idea that your sister may be there interceding on your behalf. God knows your intention. You can hope to see her eventually.Also a note on your terminology. Rather than beautified I think you might be looking for the phrase having achieved the beatific vision fancy way of saying seeing God because you are with him in Heaven. You might also be confusing the term also with beatified beautified which usually means having been declared blessed which is a stage in the canonization of saints in the Church.While it is completely proper to think of all Christians who reach heaven as being saints the Church reserves the processes of beatification and canonization i.e. public declarations for particular people who are great examples to us. Your sister should be remembered both on All Saints Day where all the noncanonized saints are commemorated and as above we can hope she is with God and All Souls Day where family and friends and all those having died in Christ are commemorated whether theyre in Heaven yet or not since we generally cannot know.,RCIA,coso5fn,1,t5_2y8ij
5429034,0,t1_cw5lrok,That sounds great! I am in a unique situation.  I belong to a parish in a large city.  It is a very urban environment that really uses their resources to help the community offering showers and meals to those who need it.  This leaves them strapped for helping hands at times. Anyways I started going to RCIA and the teacher asked me to help out with the PSR classes for th grade.  I am now teaching PSR class to kids preparing for confirmation as I prepare along side them.  It has been a really great experience. EDIT I am .  Not in th grade!,RCIA,cw5m52g,1,t5_2y8ij
