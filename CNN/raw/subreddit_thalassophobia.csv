1723476,0,t1_cjwdpxq,Ok here goes...My grandpa and I are in Hawaii we were house sitting for a rather important person to Hawaii well soon to be eximportant person as she was only royal by marriage and they were in the middle of a nasty divorce. She was staying in the house and he was on a rendezvous with his lessthanhalfhisage personal trainergirlfriend. It was quite a beautiful estate with a breathtaking view of the Pacific ocean that was just a couple of steps from the back porch. Anyway about  yards off shore is this giant fucking yacht that was theirs but has just been anchored to the bottom and left to rot like garbage. its a massive boat. Im not joking about the size. I should mention the reason we were staying here was because we were house sitting for her my grandfather and her were old high school buddies. Well one fine day my ever adventurous and pushy grandfather suggested my worst nightmare... snorkeling. We don our finest swim suits that come from only the finest bathing suit establishment Walmart and Im wearing one of his shirts because Im a sheet of paper and I burn very easily. anything to keep the sun off is OK in my book. We start in this small area he called a turtle pond. It consists of a half circle that extends from the shore to ft deep water. Great place to put our flippers and goggles on since it helps not to be knocked over by the waves so much. Everything is a go when I spot a small glint.  sure this is a sea monster of which even outdo Lovecraft... I jump out of my skin. My grandpa dunks his head under and he sees its just an old set of keys with a keychain that says Im a slut or something. He chuckles because hes a little old fashioned and chucks it by our towels on shore. yeah why do we need beach towels when the outdoor shower is even closer than the house? I chuckle still nervous and kind of shaky. I notice at this time the extra gigantic tshirt my grandfather gave me was rather constricting... but I need to keep it on because my trip will not be ruined by a sunburn. We wade into the water about waist deep and at this time I notice how fucking rocky it is under us... my grandpa being the biologist that he his says its old flow from the volcano and makes amazing hiding places for all sorts of fascinating horrifying creatures. Whatever I can do this. well just be out for a few minutes and then I can spend the rest of my time on land and I wont hear my grandfather badgering me about going snorkeling and how much Im missing out. Waist deep now theres almost no sand to speak of. just these dark rocks full of little holes and possibly the next discovered highly deadly and freakish looking critter. I just put my snorkel in and start swimming. we swim for a little ways me getting steadily more unnerved at the fact that the bottom isnt even sand anymore just dark rocks which looked like they had a thousand little sea animals dashing and darting to the darkest crevasses whenever we swam over head. So my grandfather points to something. dammit.. its a barracuda isnt it? nope.. only the biggest fucking sea cucumber in the world... pretty sure by now this thing is going to kill me or possibly even rub its slimy mass of flesh on me I panic. I go to turn around but my shirt has caught on my arms and it felt as though someone was grabbing them and it was impossible for me to swim. shit now its covering my face. now its over my snorkel. now Im breathing in sea water. I kick pushing my head straight into my grandpa who is trying to grab me to calm me down. I cant do this anymore. I cant breathe. why cant I breathe? at this moment I looked straight ahead of us parallel to the surface and all I see is rock fading into a deep blue abyss which is seemingly endless. I am very disoriented at this point and I finally figured out which way was up and shot out of the water sputtering on all of the sea water I had inhaled. I looked in the direction we were swimming. no boat. where the fuck is the boat?! wheres the shore or even the  story gleaming white mansion?! I turn around and the boat is  yards away. ohshitohshitohshit I gotta leave. I have to swim. Paddling with my arms was difficult and fighting with the tentsized shirt had left my arms burning and tired. my only option is to kick and do it now. I take my snorkel out and hold my breath... just kicking as hard and as fast with my flippers as I possibly can. I mustve been like motor boat because my next breath of air was no less than  feet from the side of the boat. at this time I saw what I thought was just water damage from the shore was actually an infestation of mollusks and barnacles... waving their slimy sticky tentacles hoping for a free meal from some unfortunate organism just passing by. Horribly terrified of slimy sea creatures such as these... more panic. I try and swim backwards but the waves were just pushing me closer to this thing. I was powerless against the will of the ocean. I decide to swim parallel to the side of the boat and keep swimming. Im exhausted at this point. my legs are burning. my shoulders are almost cramping. I cant breathe the weight of the entire ocean felt like it was crushing my chest... pushing every last bit of air from my lungs but not quite letting me get a good breath. Im crying on top of all of this which just makes everything worse. So I decide I have to look up and blink the tears out of my eyes to keep them from clouding my vision. I look up and this boat is so massive that I cant even see the red banister wrapping around the edge of the deck. Im under this huge vessel like it was an oak tree in a sunny park. worse yet the sun is directly overhead but Im still in the shadows that this this is creating. I can see the full extent of this barnacle infestation and everything underneath me. more panic. I need to leave. Im so tired. I kick and paddle my hardest fighting the crashing waves and the unforgiving cotton of the t shirt. I finally make it to shore... I dont even stop walking when I get on land. I want nothing to do with this beach anymore.first thing I do is rip this damn parachute off me... which has now clung to every crease on my body and is suffocatingly tight. I rip my goggles off dropping them on the lawn next to go are these damn penguin feet that are so tight Im feeling claustrophobic. I think I broke the strap on one of them trying to get them off. I dread even going to the outdoor shower to rinse off. I am tired of being wet plus this shower has a beautiful view of the ocean. The massive abyss that couldve swallowed me and never would have known the difference. I get in the shower and see my grandpa by the boat looking all around for me... assuming I had drowned or something. I waved to him on shore and went up to my room to take a shower the furthest shower from the ocean at that time. I had never loved solid ground and fresh invisible air more than at that time.kind of turned into a novel. sorry.,thalassophobia,cjwepl7,14,t5_2xfs1

3594549,0,t3_31hqb1,Two moments lead to my realization.TLDR  leviathan from the deep plays peekaboo and a night dive.The first was on my first scuba trip. On my certification dive my contacts had gotten messed up somehow and I couldnt wear them for the rest of this seven day camp. It was fine when we werent diving but you cant scuba dive with glasses on. We were off San Clemente island and the surge was super strong and visibility was limited to about  from all the silt stirred up in the water. We were swimming along the edge of the kelp forest so to the right was just a wall of darkness that had the potential to wrap around a fin or arm and tangle you up. To the left was a wall of greenish brown. Both of those elements coupled with the fact that I already couldnt see without my glasses made me terrified. What really sealed the deal is when a  Black Sea Bass appeared out of NOWHERE and was swimming close enough to touch. This monster was a foot longer than I was and about lbs. Out of FUCKING NOWHERE. Then the monster disappeared. Being a naive child I thought I was safe. Nope. The fucker came back only to disappear again. This happened about three times before the dive was over and we surfaced. My dive masters hand was probable bruised from how tight I had been holding it. The second time was at that same camp but a different year. This time there was a night scuba dive that the instructors wanted us to go on.  of the kids said Fuck that and so we were told to jump off the bow of the boat and swim around it twice without our wetsuits as sort of a punishment. Insert full blown panic attack here complete with crying and hyperventilating. The thought of having no idea what was under me and not being able to see the kelp and knowing that it was very likely I would get entangled in a strand was terrifying. Also we had seen a giant jellyfish earlier that day and Im terrified of those as it is since I was stung by a Portuguese man of war when I was little. My brain couldnt stop picturing those fucking everywhere in the water. One of the instructors pulled me aside and asked what was wrong and he realized that this was real terror and not a scam to get out of swimming around the boat. He let me stay on board.Going on a night dive is now a goal of mine. Its an incredible experience that I dont want to miss because of fear.,thalassophobia,cq207dr,4,t5_2xfs1

The best known examples can be found in Belize the Bahamas Guam Australia in the Great Barrier Reef and Egypt in the Red SeagtBlue holes are roughly circular steepwalled depressions and so named for the dramatic contrast between the dark blue deep waters of their depths and the lighter blue of the shallows around them. Their water circulation is poor and they are commonly anoxic below a certain depth this environment is unfavorable for most sea life but nonetheless can support large numbers of bacteria The deep blue color is caused by the high transparency of water and bright white carbonate sand Blue light is the most enduring part of the spectrum other parts of the spectrumred yellow and finally greenare absorbed during their path through water but blue light manages to reach the white sand and return upon reflection. gtgtImage i  The Great Blue Hole located near Ambergris Caye BelizeInteresting Great Blue Hole | St. Hermans Blue Hole National Park | Deans Blue Hole | Blue Hole Kentucky Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsoh oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsoh.

5724307,0,t1_cx54xmi,This is a little creepy. My fear of water is somewhat based on a similar experience. I was at a water park on the exact same type of slide slidepoolslidepool. My tube tipped when I hit the pool and I flipped over with it. Underwater now I begin to just stand up like you do when youre in like three feet of water. But I couldnt. Turns out a large women in a tube was right behind me and in order to avoid falling off her tube she caught her balance and braced herself... with my head. As a large women it took a while to steady herself. I was just about to give up when she finally let go. So I didnt drown just came close. So I believe the pressure you feel in your chest is matched by the relief you get from letting it go and the wooziness kicks in pretty quick after that since youre already close to oxygen deprived enough to pass out. What I always think about it is how long is that gap of time from when you release your breath and inhale pure water to the blackness of passing out starting.

6110719,0,t1_cyjxjbb,Sharks tend to feed when humans are least active in the water which is around dusk and dawn.Humans also arent part of shark diets because they evolved to subsist on sea creatures. Surfers get attacked because the resemble seals from below the water.The sharks that will attack you just for existing are The Bull Shark which swims up rivers to spawn and is very aggressive. The Tiger Shark which will eat literally anything we find car parts planks books even a fucking suit of armor in their stomachs. The Oceanic Whitetip is most likely to eat humans. They live in the open ocean where food is scarce. But that also means little challenge for a food source. Theyre responsible for most of the shark attacks on sailors whos ships sink in the middle of the ocean. Capn Quints story from Jaws is about the Indianapolis an American Battleship lost to a Japanese submarine in WW. More men were killed by sharks or dehydration than by the initial sinking. The Captains life raft was continuously circled by a Whitetip until rescue arrived. They took more sailors from that sinking than the Japanese did.Tldr Sharks are cool until you venture into their breeding grounds swim when they feed or get stranded in the middle of the ocean after a disaster.,thalassophobia,cyk85oz,7,t5_2xfs1

6232292,0,t1_cyxowjj,I dont see a problem with calling sharks machines. So are we Sharks are an apex of a particular evolution designed really for one purpose and thats the problem. They are very specialized whereas we have specialized in only one thing intelligence they have specialized in a perfection of being an ocean predator. Its served them well. Theyve survived for far longer than we have and if we keep going like we have been longer than we ever will. They are not designed though with intelligence as a goal as we are.  The jury is still out really on whether intelligence is better than single purpose evolution as far as long term survival. Im not saying sharks arent smart within their framework. They are extremely smart. Within their framework. But they will never step outside of the box they are in if only because of their structural limitations. Adaptable yes creatively intelligent? Nope.However if someone can come up with proof otherwise Id be happy to check it out. ,thalassophobia,cyy1kza,1,t5_2xfs1

11367999,0,t1_dfkhepz,Ill go ahead and wrap this up here.  By your responses I assume youre a teenager that hasnt had much exposure to critically considering ethics.  If these responses are coming from an adult I suggest reading more into the arguments for and against animal rights before emotionally commenting online on the issue.  There is an enormous amount of literature available from greater thinkers than either of us.  By further commenting here youre not accomplishing anything for sharks I dont think you honestly care to do anything for myself or any other readers.  At this point your comments are reduced to misplaced pride.  The evidence for this is in unnecessary remarks like gtwtf lolAgain for your own good respond conscientiously or else your message will always be dismissed.I go fishing never for sharks specifically but sometimes I catch shark as theyre in the area.  I catch and release and as the law stands Im engaged in no illegal activity.  Yes I find fishing is a fun past time.  Rhetorical questions do you think its morally wrong to fish? Are you only concerned for sharks?  Do you consume any nonhuman animals specifically sea animals as food?  In the future you have to actually support why something is wrong to be taken seriously.gtthats still wrong manThis doesnt work.,thalassophobia,dfkjh5o,1,t5_2xfs1
