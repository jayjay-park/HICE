4229221,0,t3_38pcdj,First of all let me start by saying you this. You are an incredibly naive person. You are not even half as smart as you think you are. gt Modis hyper nationalism and meddling in affairs of other nations will drag India to war.His Govts last statement of GilgitBaltistan which is a part of Pakistan has started a war of words between India and Pakistans Military and it is scary.We have a million problems on India but still why the hell is Indias govt still looking for more territory?Dude claims on GilgitBaltistan is just foreign policy . Its a simple strategy. In a dispute express your maximal position rather than the one you will compromise on For example what do you think about Chinas claims on Arunachal Pradesh? Do you really think the Chinese are interested in annexing AP from India while also starting a World War ? Dont be naive. India is probably the only big country with a huge military that doesnt claim more land than it already has.About Pakistan. It is one nation that needs to be bullied not just by India but by the entire world. This puny nation has always managed to punch much above its weight with the backing of USA first and now China. India has been unnecessarily soft on them for so long for no apparent reason. What would be the response of any nation in the developeddeveloping world to an event like ? Im not a proponent of war with a crazed Islamist country. But Pakistan should know its place. They should fear us literally. And there are several ways to do that while avoiding an outright war. Our NSAs statements on Balochistan a good example. Read this Pakistans secret dirty war in Balochistangt Even after  years since India got independence  million Indians still live in extreme poverty. Millions do not even have toilets.If you ever been to other states especially the northern India you would be embarrassed to call yourself an Indian.You are nitpicking. Massive country means massive problems. The fact that such a massive diverse country like ours have a truly working democracy with a largely pluralistic society itself is a MAJOR achievement. Also weve only liberalized our economy is the s our economic path to prosperity has only started. The next two decades are going to be very crucial. gt PakistanChina has not threatened nor killed any Malayalis as far as I know.The north Indians hatred against Pakistan is hereditary and it spans several centuries.We have no part in it and do not have to play any role in it.Typical mallu notmyproblem attitude. Lets say Kerala becomes a new country. Why should someone from Travancore care about whats happening in North Malabar? Its not my problem right?gt Im confident more than anything that if we can unite under a seculardemocraticunitedfront for a new nation we can achieve what all these nations have achieved.What secularism? Muslims vote for Muslims Christians vote for Christians and Hindus vote according to their caste preferences. Thats Kerala in a nutshell. Yes weve learned the art of liveandletlive more than any other state I agree. But when we become a nation sort of all these sectarianreligious forces will show their real face. A doomed to fail experiment until and unless Kerala becomes a truly rational society which itself is an utopian dream. gt Our population growth has come to a halt while the rest of India is still going in full speed and is heading for a disaster.All the flats near my old home is now a hub for crimesprostitution and are run by north Indians and it extremely polluted and unhygienic.I have no problems with them but if we do not control this migrant influx we would become another Indian state.This is the same sort of shit peddled by thugs like MNS and Shiv Sena. Replace North Indians with Madrasis and there you have it the Bombay of s. Population growth is already slowing down to replacement levels in the most developed states of the country the rest will follow as the economicsocial growth starts picking up. gt The right wing has started new ways of spreading propaganda with their news channel JanamTVHave a look at thair FB page comments and youll know why!.Our peaceful atmosphere where every religion can go along each other will come to an end if we tolerate such elements in the name of Indian Nationalism.Kerala should never become another Gujarat.Tell me how is IUML or Kerala Congress any different from BJP? Why is BJP the only communal party here? They are all communal in their own ways but not as extremist as SDPI or SS thats the difference. If weve learned to live in an IUMLKC ruled state whats wrong with a BJP ruled Kerala? Are their bad communalists and good communalists now? Speaking of TV channels you found  channel that propagates right wing ideas and you are agitated? What about the  other channels owned by ChristianMuslims proselytizers? As a Christian myself even Im deeply embarrassed by some of those channels. I think Modi is trying to do something good up there. His foreign policy initiatives are bold and pragmatic. His economic initiatives will help us move away from an agriculturebased society to an industrybased one. We just cant afford to have  of our people working in a sector that contributes just  to our GDP. I dont judge people based on their religion and I think Mr. Modi is on the right track crackpot MPs like Sakshi Maharaj should be reined in though. ,Kerala,cs2b87z,4,t5_2qhb2

5271397,0,t3_3n3yf5,I second Kochi or Thrissur as an ideal destination meeting your needs. Both the places are well connected via airtrainbus and you can find pretty good places to live on the outskirts if you want to get away from the daily bustles of an average Indian city. The eveningnight scene in Kochi will definitely be more active so keep that in mind while selecting a destination. You should get a rough idea if you spend a few days in some of these places. I would even recommend taking a train or a bus to a big metropolitan city like Bengaluru  hours just to see the alternatives and do a compare and contrast.The western front of Kerala has a very active train network while the eastern front connecting to the high ranges is served very well by bus networks. These are cheap and frequent and you should have no problems planning your travel even in the last minute. You can find an internet cafe in most cities and towns in Kerala so that should not be a problem. As others suggested the internet speeds may not be the best in some places but you should be okay for most activities. Most places in Kerala will be pretty green and you will not be too far away from nature. If the call of the wild is greater there are hundreds of cool trails along Western Ghats.

Mathu Pandaram is another one where he played a pappadapandaram and his bastard son. Not to mention the tons of roles where you cannot identify the caste from the name or the location. An important question would be how many explicitly Ezhava characters are there in Malayalam cinema? Unlike a Nair where the name is a giveaway I guess the Ezhava identification is possible only from the wedding ceremony or explicit shots of the home where there is a Sree Narayanaguru photo. ,Kerala,d0i3bn5,5,t5_2qhb2
