774064,0,t1_cgs8yus,I will be taking the Camino Frances from St Jean Pied de Port to Finisterre.  Ive planned  months for it just incase I do want to slow down and take my time.,CaminoDeSantiago,cgs9kgi,2,t5_2ucv9
1429653,0,t3_2ahev2,I have done both. Well all the French way and half the Northern way.Both experiences were great. Neither are too touristy yet but the prices for the hostels and pilgrim meals are rising disproportionately compared to other prices in Spain.Anyway. One route being more popular or not has its own ups and downs.Firstly I recommend the French way. Its highly social and you are constantly meeting exciting new people. The word crowded is thrown around a lot. The hostels can be crowded on both the Northern and French routes because they accommodate for the demand. Less demand  fewer hostels and beds  crowding. The more demand analogy is selfexplanatory.I truly thrived meeting new people on the French way. I didnt enjoy the isolation as much on the Northern way. Sure you could walk in peace most of the time but you would keep meeting the same people every day and its possible to get stuck with people you really dont click with. Its much easier to meet people you can happily socialise with on the French way.The Northern ways terrain is also VERY hard. Harder than I expected. Its really quite unrelenting. I recommend not taking this route without a good bit of training with slopes beforehand. I got quite badly injured on this route and had to quit early and I run marathons. My error was overvaluing my running experience. Walking up and down steep slopes with a heavy bag puts a very different kind of strain on your body. Anyway what Im getting at is that the French way is much easier but still delightfully challenging.Other things... The French way has less rain and higher daytime temperatures but chillier in the early morning. The Northern way can also be very hot but its not as common. It also rains much more but I was lucky or unlucky? enough to have walked that route during the heatwave in Europe last July.The sights are far more stunning in the North. The French way looks great too but damn dat coastline in the North. Ummph.The French way is starting to get some pretty modern hostels so you can usually expect good facilities. Less true for the North but still sufficient.Uhhhm. Lying on the beach in the North is pretty sweet.Oh and back to the touristy thing. The North actually passes through more touristy towns and cities than the French way. Theres some great nature but a lot of walking through cities at times. The great shoreline keeps your mind off it though.Im probably forgetting something but I think you will be happy with either route! Im pushing for the French way though. I personally love meeting people and you always have someone to eat and drink with in the evenings. You can always do both different years?You may notice from my tag that I did the French way twice. Well thats because I had such a great time that I brought my girlfriend with me the year after!,CaminoDeSantiago,civhfoo,1,t5_2ucv9
2554799,0,t1_cms1jyb,Yeah thats  days assuming we only need two days for nonwalking travel. Im definitely worried about pushing ourselves too quickly with that amount of time. Were working on reworking schedules so we can have more time. Its helpful to hear you think that might be a little quick.Is St. Jean where most people start when theyre walking the French Way? Ill admit I dont know much about particulars other than about how long it takes and where I end.Its good to know the roundtrip thing  that well have to make it back to the original airport if we book round trip. What would the price difference be between one roundtrip ticket vs. two oneway tickets?Good to know about the itinerary. I just want to have a basic idea of where we should be at certain checkpoints especially if we have to stick with the restrictive  days.Seriously thank you for taking the time to talk with me about this. Im so excited to finally be doing this.,CaminoDeSantiago,cms1sdy,2,t5_2ucv9
3327795,0,t3_2y9wai,It is definitely possible and people do it each year. I never saw someone doing it on horseback but I know that a few hundred arrive on horseback in Santiago each year.Thats all I can tell you unfortunately. You most likely would need some private accommodation organised for the duration of the whole trip.,CaminoDeSantiago,cp7lgsf,3,t5_2ucv9
3701187,0,t3_31p8fo,Primitivo or via de la plata but the latter will be to hot in september.,CaminoDeSantiago,cqe5roj,3,t5_2ucv9
3907244,0,t1_cr1moqv,Where I am doesnt offer a passport and I dont want to include the plane flight. It feels like it cheapens something.,CaminoDeSantiago,cr1ns7v,1,t5_2ucv9
4105261,0,t1_cro6ksh,Not on the trail currently but will be on it later this summer looking for any recommendation of a hostel or smaller place to stay in these towns as the main places are already booked up. Will look through the guides thank you.,CaminoDeSantiago,cro836w,1,t5_2ucv9
4191442,0,t1_crxtid4,Thanks! Ill be sure to go that way and book a room,CaminoDeSantiago,cry0uw1,1,t5_2ucv9
4198355,0,t1_cry67r7,If what you say is true Im extremely impressed by this product and it sounds like a great recommendation.,CaminoDeSantiago,cryt38e,1,t5_2ucv9
4342282,0,t1_csehq6p,I think Im going to remove this sticky. You can go ahead and make your own thread! More likely it will be read than as a comment here. Good luck!,CaminoDeSantiago,csf3tpa,1,t5_2ucv9

10548935,0,t3_5qy9u9,Im starting from SJPP on April .,CaminoDeSantiago,dd3u8vw,1,t5_2ucv9
11594064,0,t3_64j6jd,Sounds like a great trip! I havent walked the north route but I can confirm the last K of the Frances is quite busy and in a way it is harder to socialise there than it is most of the rest of the walk. It is more like walking with a crowd.I think my biggest piece of advice would be not to over plan too much. You have the biggest stuff down once you start walking you can get a feel for it and decide what you want your camino to be. Enjoy your time Buen Camino!,CaminoDeSantiago,dga71pi,2,t5_2ucv9
