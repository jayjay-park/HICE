They work great for pressing. I use mine at  and press in between  mini oil slicks for  seconnds. On the first press I will yield absorutery noting.  On the second press however which takes place  seconds afterthis is where you will see  percent of your oil or the ring of fire as I like to call it.

Not sure which ones but if you do a Google search you will probably find a few. No one is selling steam setups specifically for cannabis but its not hard to find and assemble some off the rack parts to make one. Basically you just need some steel tubing valves gauges fittings and a steam generator and a condenser of some sort. The cost is maybe  all in for a high quality setup. Youll also need to know what the temperature of steam is at various pressures. For instance steam at  degrees Celsius is about  psi. ,rosin,cx28gef,2,t5_37k48

6235669,0,t1_cyy7e1u,main reasons . PTC heater has a much more even surface temperature due its design not being a wire woundfoil etched resistance wire. . The PTCs resistance changes as the temperature increases lowering the power consumption while the unit is at temperature. . MCH heaters are a little bit brittle and I can break them with slight pressure between my fingers. This was my main reasoning for switching back to PTCs. The ptc and mch heaters are both insulated which are nice features for safety. Im sure you can find stronger MCH heaters but I decided to go back to PTCs after my shitty adventure into Mica plates  Resistance wire heaters are something I plan on avoiding entirely now. My set up runs off v AC yes. There is no need for a transformer as long as you purchase heaters rated for v use and the PID is also rated for v use. ,rosin,cyyfesw,1,t5_37k48

7268023,0,t3_4dqf9g,I will add my two cents. You would need a quantity of two of the following cylinder I will describe since you need both a top and a bottom flat strong heat source to squeeze your nuggets Get a total quantity of two cylinders of . diameter solid steel bar  inches high you can use any diameter I just have mine at . inches. Your normal stress on the buds is equal to the force your press can exert divided by the circular crosssectional area of your cylinder. I got mine from Metal Superstore in my town for . A cold rolled steel You now have a  inch tall solid cylinder with a diameter of . inches. You take it and a SolidWorks or and CAD software file to your local machine shop with a CNC mill who will drill two holes in each cylinder based on your model. If your cylinder is sitting upright on a flat end the two holes will be parallel to the groundflat ends of the cylinder and pass all the way from one side of the cylinders curved surface through its diameter and out the other side of the curved surface. The smaller hole will be close to the flat end of the cylinder you use for Nug contact. The other end will be attached to the press. The small hole is sized to fit a K type thermocouple that will feed an immediate temperature reading of the metal plate to your PID controller. Long story short on PID controllers they use algorithms to keep the temperature of whatever device at a chosen constant temperature. You can wire one easily with a soldering iron diagram and parts for . You can buy a readytogo plug and play one for . Check Amazon for the products YouTube and Google for tutorials. A second hole is drilled through the cylinder at halfwayheight. A cartridge heater will be inserted  snugly here. A very important note is that cartridge heaters require a very specific tolerance fit in order to transfer their heat to the metal. They are inexpensive maybe  for a nice brands Watt heater... for knock off You can calculate the mass of your cylinder with the steels density. You can calculate the required energy to change the temperature of your cylinder from room temp to operating temp with QmcdeltaTemperature where m is mass Q is energy required in Joules c is the constant of specific heat found online for your material. You can use Fouriers equation in cylindrical coordinates to calculate the exact heat transfer rate but you could just use the Power rating in watts as a good estimate of how quickly heat will be added to the cylinder by the heater. With this you can estimate the desired parameter gt the time it takes to reach operating temperature based on the wattage of the heater. Choose the one you wish for your design. Now you have two cylinders each has a heating element fit inside a drilled hole per the manufacturers precise fit instructions basically just calculate the diameter hole and dimension your CAD file with it and a thermocouple in another hole. The cartridge heater is plugged into the PID controller which turns it onoff via algorithm and the temperature reading of the thermocouple keeping your plates at whatever temperature you desire.I also think adding some high temperature electricalinsulating silicon to the edges of the holes where the thermocouple and heaters are inserted would cap off and seal up the design reducing shock hazard perhaps. Further Discussion JB weld didnt work for me personally to attach the steel cylinders to my  ton arbor press from harbor freights. Strong magnets seem like they might. JB weld began to smoke at  degrees despite  max advertised. I didnt cure it all the way  only  hours. Maybe you could have a square groove cut in the connected flat surface of a cylinder the ram of my press is square and then pressfit check Wikipedia the real use of arbor press lol the cylinder around the ram for a permanent fit. I suppose you could weld them together if you know how  I dont.  steel cylinders  cartridge heaters PID controller  Pay for CNC milling labor Thats about  there.
