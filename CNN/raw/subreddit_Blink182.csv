2937973,0,t3_2tsosg,This is how I see it. Tom is  years old give or take a few years. He has been doing blink for over  years. Thats longer than some of his fans have been alive. The man has in certain ways grown up and out of blink. He no longer relates to the songs he wrote as a squeaky voiced teenager full of angst. His passion since the original breakup has been AVA. Theres no arguing that. With all of that being said these past years as a reunited blink may have started with good intentions. Tom was genuine with reuniting the band after Travis accident but there are underlying motives. Tom clearly needs money for AVA. What was once a four piece band is down to him and his new cohort Ilan. His past few albums have been flops to say the least. Tom cannot seem to grasp this and will do anything to save his brain child. I personally believe it speaks volumes when three out of four band members leave a band working a span of two years. Furthermore for Tom to not be up front with his alleged friends he has been touring the world with for decades is childish. Tom isnt in blink for the spirit of blink. Hes in it out of selfishness. Blink cannot thrive and has not been thriving with him in it. I am willing to bet Tom is the one forcing the rest of the band to play only the hits. Thats what makes Tom money. He is worn out musically. He no longer has much to contribute to the blink world. He has left it far behind. I truly hope this does wonders for Mark And Travis. I hope  makes another album or that Mark and Travis continue making music together whether it is under blink or any other name. They are true friends and they work well together. As for Tom I hope he finds peace and finds a source for his musical talents. The boys from blink gave us  solid albums. Id rather them put the band to rest than continue appeasing Tom. Leave the legacy as it is. As a life long fan as much as it hurts to say blink is better off done. ,Blink182,co226t3,15,t5_2s593

No. In my opinion the three should just agree that blink is never going to work like it used to end the band and do what they want... Tom can put his full attention to AVA and Mark and Travis can do what they please  or what have you. Thats the only way this can be solved without a complete fallout of personal friendships.

I really hope you arent hoping he might somehow come back as that just isnt going to happen.Would be dumb if Tom puts up a legal fight but youre right he can.  The name might ultimately change to something like blink with Matt Skiba.  But in my heart of hearts it will still be blink.I really cant wait to see how Skiba sounds with them at Musink and I really hope he is the new member with blink moving forward after that I know his schedule might not allow for it but I cant think of anyone else Id like to be in that spot of the band its obviously not going to be Tom again and Skiba has such a cool voice and he loves blink and he and Mark were going to do that Cereal Killer side project anyway it seems like a strong possibility that he will end up the permanent third member.  Only reason I could think that he wouldnt would be because hed find it too difficult to juggle Alkaline Trio and blink.

You may say adding Skiba will change things up that it will sound different. You might say Tom sucks at playing live. You may say Toms heart isnt in it anymore. To me Blink was Mark Tom and Travis. I dont want change. I love Toms unique voice and dont want it to be replaced. I love when he fucks up on stage. That is part of what Blink is and should not change. Unless Tom himself says his heart isnt in blink anymore its just a rumor someone started. Im trying not to vent but its hard not to because i guess I just dont want change from my favorite band.

3436343,0,t3_2zl4e6,There seems to be a split between fans.  I think we all have to realize the two different outlooks on the situation.  One half of fans look at Blink for the music for the energy for the name BLINK.  To them you can switch out someone like Tom and as long as the songs are being performed passionately energetic and loud then its ok.  The band isnt the same but the members are enthusiastic and happy. And thats ok.  I can totally see that.  For the other half it seems to be more personal.  I know its like that for me.  Blink to me is more than just the music and I think thats why I have revere them so high.  They are akin to my best friends my idols the most relatable guys Ive never met.  Blink was so accessible and enjoyable because of both the music and the personalities and friendships of the guys.  They included us the fans in almost everything and made it feel like we were apart of the band in a sense.  So when we learn that someone as vital and important to the band as Tom DeLonge is no longer apart of it and theyre feuding it IS like your friendships on the rocks.  I think that crazy closeness with the band is a tribute to how much the band means to their fans.  So when we say things like Id rather have Blink just endits not the same without Tomthey should call it a new name...it might be a little selfish on the outside yes but its not in the spirit of if we cant have this the way we want then no one can! like a lot of you guys feel.  Its coming from a place of hurt and from a place of this doesnt feel right.  Blink to me is Mark TOM and Travis and has always been that way and always will be.  I love Matt Skiba I have every song hes been apart of.  But it is just plain weird to watch him without Tom.  The live performances sound great its not that.  He and Mark and Travis can write great music together I have no doubt.  But itll never be Blink again to the other half of the fans.  My half.  I could be on stage with Mark and Travis and replace Skiba play a whole set and Id say I played a whole set with Mark and Travis! not I played a whole set with Blink! cus to me and I think many others Blink is those three guys.  It would be the same if Mark left.  It would be the same if Travis left.  I think this sub needs to cool it with the downvoting with anyone who take the second stance.  We are just as big of fans as the other half!  We are just human and perceive it all a little differently and more sensitively maybe.  Hope that sheds some light on it!  FWIW Skiba did sound great last night.  ,Blink182,cpjyvpl,4,t5_2s593

3496246,0,t3_30b4si,I posted this review to rangelsandairwaves Poet Anderson Issue  was released digitally this morning. I bought it and gave it a read because I believe Delonge is onto an interesting idea that the animation sort of danced around a little too much leaving a lot to be desired.The comic is . in the ComiXology store and looks legit. Not just something slapdash but like a real comic book. Toms name is all over the thing and rightfully so. The artwork is pretty good and the story is well told and much more clear than the animation.The biggest issue I had was that the speech bubbles seemed out of order or at least unclear as to how they were supposed to be read. It should be noted that I am not a comic book reader AT ALL.It was about a  minute read for me and like I said it was well told with flashback etc. The only thing is I am not sure how much more I care to learn about the world so we will have to see what Delonge and co. have in store storywise.Its nice to see some products finally trickle out from Tom with all this drama coming out. I am not necessarily on his side of the blink argument but I can  get behind him wanting to create other things now that he REALLY has the time and I wish him the best. The animation for Poet Anderson was weak in the story department but well executed. This comic was well executed and had a strong story.

As for what could be improved upon....vocals. Youre emulating Tom big time and as a fan I know how hard it is to sing one of his songs without the accent but its doable. You have a good voice and I can tell when you strayed from trying to emulate the Tom voice that it was there. Like my comments to a few other guys spend time on your vocals. Youre in key like  of the time but when youre off its obvious. Keep listening and let others listen to before sending it in to be finalized. If you want good pitch correction I can do that pretty quickly without making you sound autotuned. By all means I want to help out for the next album. Also make sure youre in time. Vocals occasionally strayed a little off beat. Record those vocals a good  times and youll find that you get better with each take and you can pick apart your takes to get the best of each one.

When they dropped Up All Night I was thoroughly impressed... it made sense it sounded like a matured blink  my only gripe is the prechorus sung by Tom it was a tad to too much AvA sounding but fuck me if that Riff wasnt the perfect Blinks back hype.Then Hearts all Gone was given to us and I was as happy as can be it doesnt sound as old  school as they pawn it to be but has a similar vibe to songs like go off of untitled but a bit darker sounding. Once the initial hype of the album wore off it felt like it lacks a great deal of spirit Blinks stuff always had. Though I think that was done intentionally as the theme of the album isnt to energetic.Songs I loveUp All NightNativesHearts All GoneWISHING WELLSnake CharmerSongs I likeGhost On the Dance FloorAfter MidnightKaleidoscopeMH ..Songs I dont care forThis is home I want to like this song Toms voice in the first verse is great but it feels to disconnectedLove is DangerousFighting the Gravity Even if she FallsI think its a very solid album the problem with Blink is they have a history of making albums that are great start to finish and Neighborhoods has a lot of skippable music to me... Its hard to rank it among the rest of their work honestly and Im too biased to do so because I became a fan of their work after seeing Josie on MTV. Dude Ranch will forever be my favorite album so its obvious that neighborhoods isnt ideal to me...Travis had amazing drum work on most of the album and it might be his strongest record yet. ,Blink182,cu58e6v,3,t5_2s593

Also Dammit is great because its upbeat and features both Mark and Tom singing. I think First Date wouldnt be a bad shout lets make this last forever would be a pretty pertinent theme for a closing song. Again its upbeat however its a Tom song and for a band that features dual vocals ending on a collaborative song is nice. I really think Dammit is the perfect set list closer it features all the elements Ive previously mentioned and just works particlarly with the way the song flows allowing for a big crescendo at the start of the final chorus.

6723386,0,t3_46wig5,blink is one of the few constants in my life. i hold the band and members pretty dear to my heart. just love mark tom and travis to death. have since th grade which was  years agoafter their breakup. nobody liked them at the time it seemed and the few friends who did like them told me blink would never get back together. when it happened I was unbelievably stoked to get to high school and get multiple blink concertsan album to coincide with my graduation from adolescence. they broke up again during one of the worse weeks of my life and it all felt oddly poetic.I mostly lurk on rblink. its been great to watch people get passionate about blink here. Im working on a sleeve primarily of blink art on my left arm and my favorite song is Everytime I Look For You perfect storm of everything blink.Ill always follow Toms wanderlusty tangents off to whatever art ventures he wants to explore but thats because of what he did with blink. same with mark and travisany side projects or tv shows or books or podcasts Im there. so Im excited for the new blink album with matt because tom or no its still new blinknew stuff from mark and travis. we havent been graced with something from mark and travis collaboratively in forever. and maybewho knows? maybe we get tom back in blink in the future maybe the three actually get in the same studio and spend a year churning out a sequel that tops untitled. after all the doubts i had about them getting back together before i think pretty much anything is possible when it comes to these guys.its funny that people told me Id grow out of blink after I made it through a few years of college or simply got out into the world but if anything blink has helped me grow immensely from the moment I first heard Dammit and I havent stopped looking to it for comfort or inspiration since.

7067952,0,t1_d1hhz57,Producing is the actual recording the album. On the newest album for example John Feldmann is the producer. He tells the band what sounds good his ideas on how something should be recorded and is basically in charge of making sure the recordings of the instruments sound the way he and the band like them. They then sends these recordings off to the mixer who takes all the tracks adjusts their volumes layers them and just makes them sound good. Sometimes youll hear things like Toms voice was lost in the mix like on the newest AVA album The Dream Walker. Its the mixers job to make sure important sounds stand out while non important ones fill in the background. Once this is done its finally sent of to master which really isnt much more than choosing which songs go in which order possibly fading the end of one song into the start of another making sure volume levels are the same throughout the album and just making sure everything is in check and ok. By the end of mastering the songs are in the same state you find them in on the album and no further changes are made.,Blink182,d1hijmk,11,t5_2s593

While I love all that he did for the band he hasnt had his heart in it for awhile Ive personally  felt things were off as early as their reunion and I dont want him back in. He was constantly holding things up yes I know of his alien and government stuff but I dont care. He was treating he friendsband mates and his fans poorly there in my opinion and I dont really care for the sound he was bringing to blink as a whole. I know AVA and that sound IS Tom but I dont enjoy it and to me it brings down the quality of music that blink produces. At times it was good and gave a unique feel but overall it took away from what I think of when I think of blink as a band.I respect him and what he wants to do outside of the band and glad hes happy with all of that but I dont want him back in at all. blink is moving on and to me Bored To Death is the best theyve sounded since their reunion bar a few songs.Edit minor typo,Blink182,d2rs1qt,3,t5_2s593

7884321,0,t1_d428fua,thats cause blink  influenced most pop punk bands. theres a lot of imitators but none the same. this song sounds like modern day all time lowsos pop punk. theres certain things that just dont really belong in blink  songs its their identity. having mark sound like a pitchcorrection android no catchy guitar riffs or chord progressions and none of that punchy tom guitar twang makes it sound like any other band could have produced a song like this.at least in bored to death there was that vintage mark hoppus bridge and a familiar riff that sounds like blink . combination of old and new.this sounds like feldmann wrote a song and then asked if mark matt and travis wanted to preform it.is it a bad song? no its not its alright. its just not blink . i never had this vibe about neighborhoods despite some of their more outthere songs mostly because tom has almost always been the driving force of blink and marks songs sound like they were actually made by mark. i dunno im just ranting now.IM NOT MADIM JUST DISAPPOINTED,Blink182,d429qy2,19,t5_2s593

7953516,0,t3_4o5qol,I wish I was able to talk on this episode and provide sensible counter points to a lot of what was said. You said you hoped you didnt misrepresent the arguments from the other side which I dont think you have done but maybe you didnt address a few of the main issues. You address the lack of licks issue but compare it to neighbourhoods and suggest that its OK for this to have no licks because hoods was lacking too. It just feels such a shame its a perfect song for one cool lick perhaps on the intro or a prechorus. It just feels like it could have been so much more. People like to say thats because tom is no longer involved but mark came up with some of the best licks in blinks discography.Regarding the harmonies the culprit lines for me are the listen no more bits where they sound like offtheshelf harmonies which were historically used by Good Charlotte and made every one of their songs sound the same.Blink traditionally found more interesting harmonies or lets not forget the incredible counterpoints at the end of Feeling This which singlehandedly got me into music.So some people are saying it isnt a deep enough song and others are saying it isnt raw enough. Those two things arent opposing factors.Perhaps this boils down to it being overall too safe.I dont see how anybody can say its a bad song but I think were a bit let down because it could have been so much more.Neat podcast though guys!,Blink182,d4a1t4g,3,t5_2s593

8101965,0,t3_4q6e7s, here. Cognitive Dissonance. Been listening to BTD since it came out still cant reconcile Skiba being in blink. My knowledge of Alkaline Trio is spotty at best I only know maybe  of their songs. But those songs were in heavy rotation alongside blink with Fuck You Aurora taking lead. I like how morbid but funny some of the songs are step one slit my throat you stabbed him up not once but twice etc. Now in blink Skiba singing sappy pop punk is just...  haha what! moment especially with the Ohs and nanas. I miss Tom and his dynamics with Mark. I have to accept we wont be getting duets like Pathetic and Dead Mans Curve anymore. California is all Ive been listening to since the leak. Still getting used to Matt in blink. If Mark is full of and she said Matt is radio  something morbid. And he fulfills this in Sober radio on and a new black eye. Close enough! Overall I love California. Its a fun pop punk album. But is it blink? One day Ill have to accept it. Cant just erasereplace  years of Mark Tom amp Travis embedded in my brain just like that. ,Blink182,d4qqfk2,3,t5_2s593

Then they were even bragging about how quickly they churned out the new stuff.I mean these guys are smart. I dont think they get enough credit as human beings. That being said I feel this album is a foot back in the door and focused on bringing in the . As true longtime fans this album wasnt for us. I feel the audience is a newer younger generation. Its an attempt to bring in this younger audience and get the popularitymoney flowing again. Its quite lazy and reeks of big business. They knew we were going to eat those preorders up. They already won. At least the tour seems to be more aimed at nostalgia. Lets just hope they put some more time and effort into whatever is next.

I love live videos and covers and unique oddities  the lot. But a live show album is just not something that interests me sadly. But as I say it still is a good album by all means.

9153471,0,t3_559d5x,I have  songs and Ill explain why.. Richard Gibbs  Until the Stars Fall from the Sky.This is easily my favorite feature song from him. The only issue is that he literally sings the entire song but him and Gibbs cowrote it for the Fired Up movie. Technically it still counts as a feature but Im not sure if this song fits the criteria of feature song because hes the only vocalist in it.. Motion City Soundtrack  Hangman. If were talking about a song where Mark coleads with another artist this would be it. However Marks bridge is both short in length and is fuzzed out with some form of special effect. For those reasons his vocals arent really necessary in the song and Im not sure if you would count it as a proper feature.. Tonight Alive  Thank You and Goodnight. By all other criteria this would be it. He has a proper vocal part in the song while coleading and providing backup vocals. ,Blink182,d8c9og1,1,t5_2s593

Hes more upfront about it but hes passionate about it so I figure what the hell do your thing. Why does it bother me? His only truly bad moment was the beginning of AVA when he was talking crazy about that record but otherwise its a pretty big anomaly. Since then hes simply just a guy that likes to do a lot of things. And while he was wrong to let it get in the way it makes perfect sense that a brand like Blink got in the way of that cause its the only thing hed have to commit to for long periods of time. It actually makes perfect sense. All his other things are things he can drift to and from. Blink nails him down and its just a fact.,Blink182,d9cwba4,1,t5_2s593

Wrong wrong wrong.. The la da da part is also really cool. I tend to play Boxing Day pretty often on guitar especially as i have been working on the cover of it recently P I enjoy the little twangy riff thing. I play Bored To Death sometimes I enjoy that riff.

I dont think hes stating that they were originally gonna play  they were probably always planning on playing a bunch. But were just interpreting words from a written interview.

But yeah Im not saying he hates blink and gets pissed at the mention of it but the fact that he played one song live over the course of  years isnt really any indication that he wants people to approach him with old blink pictures to sign. But also like Ive said maybe hed be thrilled we have no way to know. lol,Blink182,dgdnh03,1,t5_2s593
