As that is all you are allowed to go back on employment checks.  Taxi cabs since they are regulated by a government entity do not have those employment restrictions.  So they go back farther all adult life and they include a finger print check witch is far better than a Social security and name check that The ride apps are restricted to. Anyone can use someone else name and social security number since it is all done on line and in some cases they never even see the applicant.,Lyft,cgmw8w8,2,t5_2uz8x

2775291,0,t3_2rt0do,I think Lyft established their business model based on how consumersthe community acted in San Francisco which is progressive open minded and values the idea of interacting with strangers. They tried to take that business model to other cities such as New York and Jacksonville and it failed. People in other cities dont value that community aspect. So their marketing and brand identity wasnt effective. When Uber moved into those markets their professional and no nonsense attitude was more appealing to consumers especially in NYC. So as a result lyft has been forced to change their business model to match the consumers demands of the cities they have expanded into. Its a shame but I blame the communities more than I blame Lyft. Note Im a lyft driver in Boston ,Lyft,cnjjgcm,3,t5_2uz8x

If you wanna smoke pull over and get out of the car. Keep a jacket in your trunk that you wear while you smoke even if its not cold  the smell carries on your clothes and can be nauseating to some people. When youre done keep the jacket in your trunk and spray regular air freshener over your side of the car and everywhere just to be certain. The Oxium is honestly over powering and not that pleasant for everyone. Get the stuff like Febreze you find at the store people will compliment the smell. Its also useful for after the rides you give to smelly people the ones whove also been smoking who reek of alcohol or just have bad B.O. etc because smelly pax really can linger trust me.

5912028,0,t3_3w5cjb,further detail about  the Lyft app will estimate how long it should take you to get there so try to be at least that fast. If you are held up in bad traffic text or call many pax prefer texts more on that in a second to let them know. Pax can cancel at any point before you arrive so dont get too discouraged if they flake on you. if they cancel you dont get paidSave the Lyft phone number its a generic one owned by Lyft into your contacts so you can text and call from outside the app if you need to. Also remember that as soon as you drop off a pax that number basically dies so if they leave something in your car after youve confirmed the drop off you cant use it to message them about it.Talking points? let them do the work besides a brief how are you doing. If a pax is feeling chatty theyll dictate where it goes. If they start onto something dodgy i.e. politics religion just respond with mild acknowledgment even if they say something dumb as hell. Also dont allow yourself to get distracted and miss a turn.Also dont hit drop off until they are actually out of the car. If you get rear ended or have some other incident with them still there you want Lyft to cover your ass.Remember that you are allowed to accept tips in cash as well as in the app. Dont turn down free money.,Lyft,cxull8x,2,t5_2uz8x
5921822,0,t1_cxvtc2u,Drivers do indeed get penalized for cancelling after accepting. It counts against your acceptance rate just as if you ignored it. However this is not the case if you cancel at least  minutes after arriving. Sounds like OP is saying the drivers arrive see the destination then drive down the block to hide and wait for  minutes before they cancel. Thats really shitty but I dont have any advice for OP other than to keep reporting drivers who do this. I didnt realize this was a widespread issue. EDIT actually OP Id just recommend not putting in your destination at all if this is a recurring problem for you. Its not a perfect solution but may help.

Thats assuming an  used Prius with  useful miles left on it  for the car  for tires and  for misc like oil wipersetc. Gas will vary based on your driving but Ive gotten mine as low as mile. The taxi industry which is a good milestone to use for transportation vehicles routinely gets  miles out of their hybrids where the Prius value will get down to . per mile on a purely depreciation standpoint.

I believe the exact quote wasAnd furthermore if you go ahead and do it anyway well drop you the first time we get a chanceSource  I somehow doubt Uber is going around calling every driver in Seattle. I realize it could be anyone but my hunch is on your insurance company. They may have seen a tweet you made about lyftuber or they may have seen a TNC sticker on your car and are looking to drop you or depending on your circumstances sue you if you had an accident while working and made a claim when your policy is for personal use and not business. This issue with unionization would be a perfect alibi for them to call you and get you to admit to driving without any suspicion on their identity.Uber would probably send an email trying to argue their side instead of calling the individual driver which would take a massive amount of timeresources.

I leave this message only for other people that may be looking with similar questions. Geico and Progressive classify it as commercial operation regardless of actual rideshare drive time and have big rates.  They also indicated that they would cancel policies if you engaged in rideshare activity without a commercial policy.Allstate State Farm were similar.  Liberty Mutual indicated that they wouldnt care if you were ridesharing but would not cover you while doing it.  Erie provided the only real rideshare policy by considering lyft and uber to be business use rather than commercial use think delivering pizza.  Get a small bump mo in premium and your personal coverage covers the entire time.It was a bunch of footwork... or finger work... but enlightening to see how different agencies are characterizing it.,Lyft,d1ucr93,2,t5_2uz8x

Do I like getting canceled on en route? No! Should there be something that needs to be done? Absolutely. What I think they should do is have the first minute be the grace period where pax can cancel without any penalties. After that minute any miles driven by the driver toward the pickup should be charged until the cancellation. If the pickup  arrival is successful this charge is waived. What about drivers who take the longest route possible getting to the pax? There needs to be a set maximum pax can be charged and the pickup distance is known by driverLyft. What about pickups  or  minutes away? Lyft needs to fix this and implement a pickup radius per car. They are a tech company or so they purport.

Lyft needs to start charging passengers for ALL cancellations regardless of time elapsed since they requested.  minutes is entirely too long and were supposed to be dealing with adults. If youre not mature enough to keep the commitment for the ride you requested you should have to pay for your immaturity. Same goes for drivers. If you accept a request dont cancel.

This update is a vast improvement over the previous version... ,Lyft,dgey65o,1,t5_2uz8x

11693270,0,t3_66upu3,Lyft policy says no rides for unaccompnied minors. That would include you. If someone gives you a ride it would be in violation of policy,Lyft,dglg83e,9,t5_2uz8x

11721322,0,t3_673fuw,I live in the same area and do all most all of my rides in philly. I would definitely switch regions for the AHG. Here are my guaranteed hours from last weekend. Youll probably still have the  tiered power drive bonus which sucks but its better than nothing. ,Lyft,dgon4cn,1,t5_2uz8x
11723378,0,t1_dgovf8q,Maybe the people that have given me less than  just havent left any written reviews yet.,Lyft,dgovij3,2,t5_2uz8x
11723578,0,t1_dgovr38,As a driver I think they need to do more to get more passengers whatever that may be.  I want to drive exclusively for Lyft but Im applying to Uber because I often go  minutes between rides or worse.  Last week on Friday evening I didnt get a single ride request in a highly populated city neighborhood from  pm.,Lyft,dgowbyl,1,t5_2uz8x

11782378,0,t3_68376n,Yeah I think this will need to be a crowd sourced option to designate which areas are illegal. Lyft cant wont? manually add all of the illegal spots but if drivers can mark which areas are illegal that would probably help a lot.,Lyft,dgvkjy3,3,t5_2uz8x
