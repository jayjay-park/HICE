I lived on a street junior year Arlington St. that was easily  residents and  students and if not it was . Several of those residents were Temple employees and were just as proud of the university as the students living next to them.Edit For context I came to Temple in  and just graduated this past May . The change even from my freshmen year to senior year was incredible. Gratz St. between Berks and Norris was EMPTY literally empty lots. Now it is one of the most popular student blocks. I do not think this has anything to do with gentrification and everything to do with Temple becoming a destination school where students want to live instead of commute.  ,Temple,clm80u4,2,t5_2ro0v

The only game I went to this year was the night game my friends and I got drunk as shit and had a blast left early cause it was too damn cold after we started to sober up came back drank some more and went out and that was a great night.

If they wont do it legally you can withhold rent because they are required to keep it at a minumum of  degrees or have a working thermostat capable of maintaining that temperature if you control the temp.

Other classes include Python C SQL MySQL JS etc.No comment on the BSMS program I dont know if anyone I know has done it.Yes there are a few career fairs a year and some big companies do show up. At the last one I went to I remember Lockheed Martin was there and some other ones as well. The CS department also has some connections to companies like J.P. Morgan and theyre a known internship source. Youll also get a fairly steady flow of emails with open development positions at various places so Id say they do their part with finding employment opportunities.I somewhat agree with uAndrewJM no CS program is going to really prepare you for real software development. The classes will give you a real foundation but internships are where the real experience comes from though some professors actually do a pretty good job of representing the different work aspects.The active members of our ACM chapter are actually pretty on top of hackathons and such and TU Dev whose membership overlaps with the ACM chapters is going to be hosting Owl Hacks in a little bit.

5991138,0,t1_cy4rbol,Im guessing you did not see the results of Kenney meeting with Temple . The Eagles will not budge on their proposed contract so Kenney called them out on it. He can not force them to change the deal and sees the situation Temple is in. Regardless an on campus stadium is going to happen eventually no matter what. These issues now are just delaying it. Parking solution Currently the lots that would be available as on campus options are the  spot Montgomery Parking garage and a  spot parking garage on th. That is  spots right there. Lets say there is an average of  people per car. That is  people right there. With some extra land between the stadium and the soon to be built indoor rec center corner of th and montgomery Temple will build a parking lot that can be used for tailgating as well. Temple will most likely work with local businesses and use local parking lots like the parking lot at Broad and Spring Garden and the parking garage at Hahnemann for parking and offer shuttle buses to the stadium. This is what The University of Georgia does since they do not have much parking. Also since Temple is easily reached by both the Broad Street Line and the SEPTA Regional Rail system people from all over the city and suburbs have easy access to reach campus without having to deal with city parking and can easily drive or take transportation to their local station. All one would need is the SEPTA One Day Independence Pass and it would cost them only  round trip. They would also have the option of taking the Regional Rail to the Broad Street line for less walking which would still only be  thanks to the Independence Pass. For people concerned about tailgating regular fans will be able to tailgate on Liacouras Walk and the soon to be built quad. Fans groups organizations and so on will be able to reserve space on the quad and set up their tailgate. Students can either go to the quad or pregame and tailgate in their homes or in greeklife houses most schools with on campus stadiums do this. Traffic will be an issue for those that drive but as long as police make sure nobody parks in the rd lane on broad  lanes will be able to handle traffic well with police directing traffic rather than lights. You do realize that most of the violence around that involves Temple students is strictly drug related or the person committing the crime was from a different area of Philadelphia? Look at most of the larger incidences like the recent rape or the girls beating people with bricks. None of those people lived in the area.Now for the community you need to look at how Temple has impacted the area already. Where would North Philadelphia be without Temple? Temple has been the economic engine in the area for a very long time. Temple has had over  students since the s and has done nothing but grow since then now reaching nearly  students. It has recently become a more residential campus with  somewhere between  and  students living on or around campus. The area from Diamond to Oxford and thth is mostly students. The people complaining are a very vocal few. Where the stadium is being built I believe there  houses on Norris and th combined that belong to nonstudents. All of th except for one house is students and there is the home of the woman who runs the day care on Norris and also two homes near Carlisle that are non students. In addition to that is the Diamond Apartments building which i believe is a mental rehab building. The people complaining are making it seem like the area where the stadium is being built is mostly local residents which is not the case. I do understand their concerns though. But for  football games  graduation commencements  freshman orientation event lets say  concerts and lets say  high schoolyouth games which is  days out of  especially with most events happening on Saturdays most people complain will not be directly impacted by the events at the stadium in the form of traffic parking or ability to take public transportation. They will have to deal with loud fans and trash which should be cleaned by a cleaning crew but hey if you are living next to the th largest university you are going to have to deal with stuff like that. The stadium will only continue the grow the economic impact. Temple has drawn two shopping centers an increasing amount of storefront restaurants  food trucks new housing increased security and jobs security dining halls janitorial positions etc. to the area that would never have gone to North Philadelphia without Temple. Temple is the cities largest employer and also is the cities number one educator for a college education. This stadium will bring more people to campus including alumni who might have not seen campus in a very long time. Many of these people will be likely to check out local bars like Maxis Masters Pubb Webb and the Draught Horse or grab some food from a food truck or a place like Richies. This will bring increased demand from people for more on campus bars and places to eat which could lead to more development of those places in the area around the stadium. This bring more jobs waiters hosts cooks bartenders bus staff managers to the area and gives all residents more options to eat. While only temporary construction will also create tons of jobs. The community will also be able to take advantage of the stadium in multiple ways. They will be able to have local high school games in there. Youth football teams will be able to play games as well. Community churches could also be able to hold large outdoor masses. It also gives easy access to Temple games since much of the local youth would love to see real college football by only walking a few blocks and paying under  a ticket and not having to worry about travel or parking. The full time residents will also be able to go to concerts they go to tons at the Liacouras Center and other events happening at the stadium. It also allows the University to grow to be what it wants to be which is a large urban school with the combined experience of a traditional college with all the benefits of being smack dab in the middle of an amazing city. Temple is doing so much in the near future new library the quad  new dorms JampH renovations completely new campus landscapegreenscape new indoor rec center new athletic fields new indoor practice facility for sports teams and this stadium makes it complete. It has been in talks for a very long time but is being brought up now since the lease with the Linc is ending very soon. The stadium will enrich the student experience lead to a stronger campus build stronger alumni bring alumni back to campus lead to more potential donations and potential to allow the football program to grow as it has been for the past  years. Nothing is guaranteed but the all the potential is much greater than the negatives of being at the Linc and not gaining anything other than a good place to tailgate and easy highway access.,Temple,cy4ywf9,4,t5_2ro0v

Its funny that even in the s when this community was rebounding from the selfinflicted riots of the early s it still made demands of Temple as of the school owed them shit. The article repeatedly refers to this area as their land which much to detriment of your argument it isnt. Youve lived there a while and have the opportunity to do that as long as you want. Not a single person is stopping you provided you pay the market rate that everyone else is subject to. Dont want to do that? Then move like all of us would have to do if our neighborhoods got better cleaner and safer but couldnt afford it anymore.  The fact that you think Temple needs to do anything shows how much youve come to expect from the dwindling number of taxpayers left in this city. The this is mine get the fuck out mentality is exactly what youre accusing temple students of being but the difference is theyre actually becoming functioning members of society. You dont own north Philadelphia and neither do Temple students so society is choosing the side thatll make progress for everyone. Youre basically arguing that an antibiotic is bad because itll force fresh healthy cells into a system. The afflicted cells arent evil theyre just not what they could be. Fight it and youre condemning yourself to never see how great it could make things for you if you saw the positives.   The relationship between the two hasnt been awful the concept that Temple was going to bend over and give you everything her students work and pay for is just naive. I dont block my neighbors driveways and then expect them to pay my rent  that you expect the school to embrace extortion is a clear indication of your dedication to the area. Our community legitimately just means we few people not the ones that dont look like us which is the literal definition of discrimination.  Laughable. ,Temple,d7kjpt8,0,t5_2ro0v
