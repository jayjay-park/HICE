6449096,0,t1_czlb7vz,gtsimply denying it does not refute it.Certainly. Lets keep this in mind.gtThe argument is absolutely ad hoc.This claim seems to be the point at issue. Am I right? You dismiss his examples by claiming theyre handwaving and not analogous. Lets take a look at those examples.brojanglesgtFor example he says a tree can survive being uprooted and replanted but thats not whats going on with a soul because consciousness is not simply dependent on things like memory and sensory input thats all consciousness is in the first place.FesergtIn normal circumstances a tree needs to be rooted firmly in the ground if it is going to survive.  Thats what roots are for after all  to root the tree to the ground so as to provide it stability and take in nutrients.  Knock it over so that it is torn out by the roots and it will die.  But there are of course abnormal circumstances wherein it can survive without being rooted to the ground  namely when it is nourished hydroponically instead.Youve misunderstood the argument again. The issue is not that the tree survives being replanted. The issue is that in normal circumstances in nature no ground means no tree. However there are what Feser calls unnatural circumstances say a hydroponics lab that remedy the loss of suchandsuch by supplementing nature. So the analogy goesuprooted tree  hydroponics lab  digestionless human  IV feedingdigestionless human  IV feeding  legless human  prostheticslegless human  prosthetics  deaf human  artificial tympanic membraneetc...So the argument he ultimately makes is thusuprooted tree  hydroponics lab  dead human  xwhere x  some intervention or supplement to nature.Obviously this argument depends on an understanding of AristotelianThomistic metaphysics and Feser admits that we cant provide the sort of metaphysical supplement required in this case. But God can. So if you accept those initial assumptions this is the argument. I expect you to reject them of course thats fine. No one is trying to convert you here.gtConsciousness is  produced by chemical reactions in the physical brain.This is the same kind of assumption. If you accept that consciousness is  brain chemicals then you can probably construct a strong argument that it does not survive death. But thats not at all what this thread is asking about.Look. I get that this is your worldview but you need to understand that this is a historical viewpoint that you didnt discover or invent. You are not presenting a new idea and you are not magically immune to the criticisms of that idea. You can have evidence that consciousness is  brain chemicals which you can describe and we can discuss or you can hold it axiomatically as a belief. Nobody cares what you believe but it isnt automatically true because its what you think. You can deny all of this as you have in the past but remember that simply denying it does not refute it. Those are your words.The article you posted is totally irrelevant to anything at stake. No one is arguing about streams vs. chunks of consciousness. And besides I think were getting too deep into the weeds here. I think I was wrong when I said that the point at issue here is that David Feser made an ad hoc argument.The OP came to a specialized forum with questions about a particular viewpoint in a particular philosophical framework. Without reading the linked article or engaging the questions at all you told us that the whole framework is unfamiliar to you but stupid and wrong because it doesnt align with your existing assumptions which you refuse to discuss as such. So it wasnt that he made what you deem an ad hoc mistake I think the issue at hand is that you were just looking to fight people who dont agree with you. You saw ad hoc as the easiest copypaste argument to use here and so you went for it. Then comes combat as you can see. Predictable.Why do you do this? Why are you here? If you think the world is only sense data why are you wasting time arguing about ideas on the internet? Do you argue with people like this in real life? Shouldnt you have better things to do and experience? Do you want to convince people that youre right about these things? Do you care about being right about these things? Are you just trolling?Its fascinating. Im beginning to understand you but still somewhat confused. Maybe thats what keeps the magic alive.,ELINT,czmdkra,5,t5_2vmfq

6964596,0,t1_d0izfg8,As someone who has attended a couple of recovery groups for a while Ive seen the devastation in the lives of functional alcoholics and other addicts.Mostly human addictions are coping behaviors for unresolved issues unmourned traumas and unprocessed experiences that accumulate throughout our lives. Willpower is rarely enough to break any habit. If God and the Bibles writers put alcoholism and sexual sins adultery homosexuality lusting in the heart in the same category one would assume that a wellperformed fourthstep inventory would help a person with any temptation they want to stop giving in to. This assumes of course that the person wants to give up that sin.,ELINT,d15rtow,1,t5_2vmfq
