3869105,0,t1_cqx27jp,Thank you for your detailed response! You know we dont actually hold inventory  POs shipping containers are sent directly from our manufacturer to our customer so we dont have a need to manage inventory or deal with FIFO processing... really we just need to use our customers PO i.e. sales order to generate a PO to our manufacturer and then we wait for the proforma invoice to come from our manufacturer. Once we have that we can use the quantities reflected on the proforma invoice to send an invoice to our customer. I like the idea of taking advantage of the cloud and I certainly dont want to be tied to one computer or laptop which is why I am somewhat torn between QBO and QBP. Does this information help at all in you advising me...?,QuickBooks,cqxb84h,1,t5_2u6ua

So lets say that the check you voided was a Sales Tax payment and you report and pay sales tax quarterly. When you voided that check the payment for that liability was not made and will need to be added to the current quarter. So Quickbooks zeroed out the check but created a Journal Entry so your Balance Sheet for the end of February would be the same. Quickbooks also entered a Journal Entry for the current quarter to increase what you owe it should be the reverse of the February Journal Entry. This way when you run a report for this quarters Sales Tax Liability it is increased to account for the amount of the check that was voided.,QuickBooks,culziz2,2,t5_2u6ua

5920077,0,t1_cxvmv7e,I can see the benefits of being able to monitor their backups.  For my data I have to have local and offsite cloud backups but Im paranoid.  People just dont take things seriously.  Youre probably one of the most handson accountants Ive seen.  Its amazing how much accounting has merged with IT support.  Some people just have no clue... whats a start button!?  Ive found it adds a ton of value and builds loyalty to not only help the client with their accounting needs but make sure they get their file back and restored correctly.  For some people I just do it for them GoToAssist makes that painless.  While I would love to not have seemingly run an IT support service sometimes its the best way to take care of things.  Whats the alternative for them?  Call Intuit and sit on the phone all day?  I wouldnt subject my worst enemy to the punishment that is Intuit customer service.Another related area are passwords.  You can bet the same people who refuse your backup service which sounds great btw are the same ones who use the same weak password for everything.,QuickBooks,cxvnj54,2,t5_2u6ua

On the File menu in Quickbooks Select List gt Item List Find your Service Items and Select Edit from the lower left menu or Ctrl E. Youll see Account at the bottom left. This is where your sales of this item will post. It should be an Income account a very common mistake is for users to set this as a Cost of Goods Sold or Expense account.,QuickBooks,cy7dy8d,1,t5_2u6ua
6924911,0,t3_4akdor,You are on the right track.  There is no need to account for every single stock...you can just account for it as a whole.I would personally opt to make this even easier and only have  accounts but I guess that just depends on how serious this project is for you.  To illustrate an exampleDepositing money into the Brokerage Account    DR  Brokerage Account Asset         CR  Operating Bank AccountAccounting for changes in the Brokerage Account Balance at the end of the month    DR . Brokerage Account Asset         CR . GL Brokerage Account Equity This acct is not a sub account it is an equity acctI wouldnt do any entries when stocks are bought or sold.  The cash collected from the sale would likely stay in the brokerage account until you withdraw it or buy something else.  I also wouldnt bother differentiating between interest and dividends because youll get a yearly  with the breakdown anyways.  If you withdraw money from your brokerage account you would switch the credit and debit side of journal entry .  If your brokerage account lost money one month you would switch the Credit and Debit side of journal entry .  I guess an account for fees makes sense because that might be something you want to be conscious of...but ultimately it is still sort of a loss on the brokerage account.  Im not sure if the  will include the trade fees because my trades are free.  If you are intent on writing these fees off on your taxes you could still keep it easy and do one yearly adjusting journal entry to pull the fees out from the GL account where everything has been amassing.Adjusting journal entry to pull the fees out of the GL account    DR .

7746479,0,t3_4kb3qa,When you click on the QuickBooks Desktop Icon click and hold down the ctrl button while it loads. This will cause QuickBooks to start up outside of a company file. then you can try to open it by selecting the file on the menu.NOTE  I recently have had an issue just like this where the file would act like it was going to open but it would just get stuck with the console showing but no company file.  The only way I could get out of this was to go to task manager and complete a hard close.  What I ended learning way to late was that the QuickBooks webconnector was getting stuck and kept creating new dbdata.dll or dbdata.dll files in my temp folder.  This process would restart every time I tried to use QuickBooks Desktop even two months later.  If I did not go in to force close QuickBooks it would completely fill my harddrive over gb and slow everything down.  So if its getting stuck type in temp in your search and make sure this is not happening to you.If it is dont waste your time calling intuit they still havent found a solution for me.Matthew,QuickBooks,d3mpvf5,1,t5_2u6ua
7876750,0,t1_d419ecq,Hosting works like this the host installs QuickBooks using YOUR license number. The host then puts your QBD file on their server. If they have the capacity to host multiple concurrent users YOU must have sufficient licenses for the number of users. The hosting company has a login for each user through their portal. The user then logs into their hosted session using Remote Desktop. It looks like you are sitting in front of the remote computer. Hosting companies will charge extra for installing other applications such as Adobe Word Excel or even Outlook. Again YOU must supply licenses for each. Part depends on whether you have five licenses and whether the host can set you up to have multiple users. HTH,QuickBooks,d41f3sd,2,t5_2u6ua

How should I set that up so that it all gets captured properly? I was thinking that it shouldnt just be a vendor like all the other bills so originally I set it up as a longterm debt but it looks wrong on the balance sheet. Should I be recording those bill payments as equity or something?,QuickBooks,dgqejiq,1,t5_2u6ua
