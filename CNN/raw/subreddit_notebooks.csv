19467,0,t1_cegg5p3,I always make my own page numbering and table of contentsindex in my notebooks so already having those details already is a HUGE selling point for me. I typically use pencils or Pilots Precise Grip rollerball pens. Seethrough is a huge factor for me as well. And Im in love with the giant size of the notebook. Not sure if I could find something similar to it. Unfortunately  is a bit out of my price range.

The notebook itself is very durable Im really careless with my stuff bc even after  months theres only minimal damage to the edges  The binding is great and lies almost completely flat now that its loosened a little. My only complaint is that the lines are too dark making it hard to read my writing but for  this notebook is worth it.

Im no expert on the inner workings of Hobonichi but I doubt they will come out with one with an august start date.That being said they do put plan ahead sections in the monthly and daily area for the preceding December and the following January. No August though. What you could do is get one now get used to it use if for school in August and if you like it enough buy it for the next year too.I was tempted to get the original slightly cheaper or the Cousin for the weekly spread but I wanted to set myself up for success by getting used to one in English first...,notebooks,crim7gk,7,t5_2r3a4

Like a Filofax?  A new Filofax comes with a whole bunch of different inserts  Yearly Monthly Weekly pages plain lined note pages To Do pages etc.  You can certainly refill it with just lined note paper.  You can either buy whatever you want and hole punch them yourself or you can buy packages of lined note paper with the holes prepunched.Or are you looking for one that looks like that on the outside but has slots on the inside where you can slide the notebook covers into?

7564295,0,t1_d31vdz6,Threading is a concept I have seen in a bunch of bullet journal blogs. The basic concept is that if you create a page or spread in your notebook and fill that page up and begin using another page further in then next to your page number you put an arrow to the right and the number for the next page you are using for the same topic. Then on that page you went to you put a left arrow and write in the page before it you had that subject on.That process allows you to use an individual whole page for one subject. Then on the next page you devote that to the next subject. The threading allows you to easier find the one subject while studying without having to carry multiple notebooks or having lots of blank pages in divided sections.,notebooks,d320va5,10,t5_2r3a4
