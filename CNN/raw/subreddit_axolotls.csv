343040,0,t1_cfg37sa,Exactly. Theyre just a bit of extra movement in the tank but shes so used to being handfed I dont see her eating too many. Once the guppy population starts getting a bit much I might try training her to eat them lol,axolotls,cfgbqb3,1,t5_2sm50

497685,0,t3_1ztbgm,Do you have any kind of freshwater gammarus in the US? Those are a nice little snack for your axies and you can catch them in clean freshwater.Keep in mind that some gammarus alone are no healthybalanced food for an axie.,axolotls,cfwu9jd,1,t5_2sm50

724873,0,t3_22gu14,also where can I keep the babies? they are in a refeugem attatched to the big tank. was wondering if I could actually put them in my  gallon daphnia culture tank or if the water would be bad for them I accidentally got the big daphnia and when I got the small ones they were outside too long and froze. just thought they would have easier access to the little baby daphnia. ,axolotls,cgmo6ja,1,t5_2sm50

1469878,0,t3_2b01y7,I dont understand your circumstances but none of your options sound reasonable. Fridging is traumatic and not appropriate for a caring owner to do for convenience especially if nobody is able to change the water.  A fridge container will become toxic without a water change.Two days without food is not terrible if the axolotls are well fed before hand but the temperature must be managed somehow.  The last time I responded to you you said you had bought a chiller. That is what you need to keep a regular temperature if you have to be away for a few days at a time.Without the chiller in use you really need to find someone you can trust for a small job like checking that the AC is on .  ,axolotls,cj0iwff,2,t5_2sm50

3501514,0,t3_30dghv,It depends. A whole tail curling is usually just normal axie behavior. It is when the very end tip of the tail is curled that usually indicates stress. I know they have a visual example of a axie tail curled in stress at www.axolotl.orgrequirements scroll down and look under Water Flow if you want to verify for peace of mind!,axolotls,cprebec,2,t5_2sm50
3560416,0,t3_31233z,Did he loose a part of the tail before? Looks like fresh grown. Check your tank decoration for sharp edges. ,axolotls,cpy42kj,1,t5_2sm50

4716858,0,t1_ctp3ijf,But also look at possible causes for fungus. Is it too hot? Over C? Is your axolotl stressed from too much light or activities such as moving around? ,axolotls,ctp3jzg,2,t5_2sm50
4729515,0,t1_ctqoqs7,Thank you!No I dont use silicone no needThe caves hold themselves well buried in the sand and the top piece is flat on its heavy so Im not worried about it moving unless I move it aroundLike I said that was my second design I am currently working on my th dont have any photos atmBut the plants I use now areJava ferns Anubis Moss ballsI keep regular light on for only  hours a day for plants so axos dont get hurt in anywayThats all I do for my plants ,axolotls,ctqp33s,2,t5_2sm50

4958937,0,t1_cuekv0f,If they are acting funny and the water has had problems I would fridge them there is a guide in the sidebar or just put them in a separate container momentarily and do a  water change including scrubbing out the tank until youre happy its clean. Let the new water cycle for at least an hour but as long as you keep your filter wet while youre cleaning the tank you should be able to put the axies back in quite soon Make sure youre not leaving old food in the tank for too long it leads to ammonia building up. You should change at least  of the water every week or two to keep ammonia leaves down if you arent already. Feel free to ask any questions if you need help ,axolotls,cujm3ji,1,t5_2sm50

5279210,0,t1_cvm3c64, slate can cause injuries. You can use it but you have to be super careful and make sure it doesnt have any sharp edges and you also have to make sure it doesnt flake off and expose a sharp edge in the future. Its also a big pain to clean if you have it laying flat or adhered to the sides.,axolotls,cvmhaky,2,t5_2sm50

6057007,0,t1_cydkaxz,I have heard the same for tea baths. There are axolotl specific forums at caudata.com that have instructions on how to do them for a salamander. If you are thinking about doing one now or possibly soon that would be the place to look. They might even have a similar situation to yours in the archives. Check out the SickInjured Axolotl section and the tea bath should be stickied near the top. ,axolotls,cydkkey,1,t5_2sm50
6352909,0,t1_czbq2bh,He might not be reacting well to the food  I dont know how much protein vs. carbs are in those pellets?! But maybe he will be better on earth worms. You could always try some carnivore pellets I use these as well as earthworms and they respond so well to them.With the temps being as low as that it will definitely help if it is a fungal infection. Cool temps and regular water changes is all Ive needed with internal fungus but I dont know what other people may have tried. Is your tank cycled? Do you have a liquid test kit? ,axolotls,czbr7aq,3,t5_2sm50
6865834,0,t1_d0uh2qg,Ive raised babies but this year Ive just been leaving eggs in with the adults. They hatch the adults eat them. Seems less wasteful than just throwing them away.,axolotls,d0ujwov,5,t5_2sm50

6939504,0,t3_4aqsa9,Two tips for any new people reading this.. Dont take axolotl advice from anyone whos axolotl isnt an adult. This guy has had his axolotl for a few weeks best and knows nothing..

7669491,0,t3_4joibe,you could try feeder shrimp or earthworms instead ,axolotls,d3dz6qf,1,t5_2sm50
8545219,0,t1_d69pcgg,Id just be picking up Canadian nightcrawlers meant for fishing from walmart. I can get  for a couple dollars. I want to finish the  pack of blood worms I bought along with the axie just so theyre out of my freezer and then Ill break up worms as long as necessary. As for shrimp I might start with ghosts just because they should theoretically survive longer but when I start breeding them myself Ill do cherries. I might do a couple color varieties and just do like  ten gallon tanks. Then I can sell the extras in addition to feeding less desirable ones to the axie. I havent truly planned that far ahead yet enough to have anything prepared.,axolotls,d69q1is,1,t5_2sm50

9272286,0,t3_57de9u,Leave the tank as it is unless they are going to get hot.  water change a day to do the work of the filter. As long as you keep your ammonia nitrite and nitrate under control axolotls could care less about water flow. In fact they prefer little to none.,axolotls,d8rburd,2,t5_2sm50
9692699,0,t1_da7sw65,That makes sense. Ill double check at the store tomorrow to see if that was the issue.

10946239,0,t1_de902a7,Get a drip test that you can use multiple times! Check before and after.Please read up more about aquariums and tank chemistry. You dont need fish poop to cycle a tank. Just a running filter and patience. A spike after the first inhabitants moved in can happen but it should be quite low e.g. Going from zero to . and back. Another reason to closely monitor the values at the start.,axolotls,de90zkk,2,t5_2sm50
