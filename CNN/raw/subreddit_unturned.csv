Multiple use but wont work on one person more than once maybe twice but there should be some time between those so it isnt yay book and instant  levels. also you should only be able to make guides for things that can be learned so no accuracy or health guide.

Even then VAC does NOT ban instantly upon detection of an injected DLL. VAC does take a few weeks or more to ban an account that has been detected. Sure they can create a new steam account but VAC will not be the only method for banning hackers on servers.

1728923,0,t1_cjx18vr,Claiming to use a new engine when its still ARMA  in my eyes is a scam. Renaming said modded engine to further diffuse trails is even more shady When DayZ started  we took the source from the existing RV Engine  Over the last many months extensive clean up new functionality and so forth has been created for that engine  while at the same time vast amounts of it were removed or rewritten entirely. The changes Dean spoke of entail major leaps forward in that work with those changes and the many more that will come through out development  we have begun to approach the point in which DayZs engine is so no longer recognizable as RV and because of that  and the massive work to come it is now known by its own name Enfusion. and for further proof of other games doing the same and that is happens everyday in game Development Call of Duty for their current game engine titled the IW Engine used id tech  engineaka Quake Engine which they then saw couldnt achieve fps and saw how similar Source Engine was to it and that is COULD achieve fps which they then took source and created their own current engine IW Engine whatever number it is on nowStill having less content in the SA then the mod is just pathetic. Allow us to remember this while the mod was still basically an Alpha aswell let me remind you something. DayZ Mod was a Mod for ARMA . Using all of ARMA s assetsnot recreating them or creating their ownAt release. DayZ Standalone is on a highly modified engine which means you no longer can just say Hey the GPS from the mod is still in the files of SA why dont you flip the switch and allow it to spawn in SA? because that asset wont be as I guess recognizable would be the word probably a bad way to explain hopefully you get my point by the engine as most people think. I can tell you im an armature programmer ive created a piece of software and im now slowly trying to recreate it into a full OS and I cant just take this from the software and put it into the OS code because its not the same. Allow me to also say that DayZ Mod is on version ... What version is DayZ Standalone on? . sir there is a long time of development to go before you can complain about that especially when like I said earlier the mod used mostthey did create some of their own stuff of course ARMA  assets in the Mod. Meanwhile the SA has had almost all of the current features are made from the ground up from the dev team.While having worse preformance than the mod Because its an Alpha there is plenty of placeholder items in the system that isnt completeZombies AI currently in game is placeholders theyre working on the new Zombie AI implementing the new Navmesh has helped a lot while it cant be done in every building at the moment you can easily lock a zed inside of a house now. Like theyve said once the new rendering system is inplace taking out the old one and implementing the new parts the game will run so much better hence why a version on the PS will even be possible. I could go on but those are  Ill never see again put to no use at all. I cant play DayZ SA at a Framerate above  while I can play the more complete more fun and more intense mod flawlessly above  on High.Im sorry to hear youre having theses issues I hope once the new system is in place that the game will preform much better on your setup. Im not gonna lie I play the Mod more then SA but thats because I am awaiting these new systems to be implemented. And even then when I go to play SA I personally get my  I paid for back within my first hour of playing. And ive logged so many hours and its completely worth the money for me im sorry you dont share the same experience.And its over  Months now since the StandAlone was released. Do they have working Zombies yet? Last time I checked they still glitched through the walls or when you killed them they just respawned on the spot to make Zombies a tougher enemy and not some minor annoyance. Let me rephrase your first sentence And its over  months now since the Standalones PreAlpha was released Let me ask you sir how long do you think game development lasts? There are plenty of games that have small development times like yannoo..... years. Guess what  months ago the PreAlpha build was released. Literally youre acting like one of the kids that think when this was released it was the full game. And with the whole once you kill themzeds they respawned on the stop that is a big lie lol okay send me the footage of you killing a zombie and it immediately respawning infront of you cause ive played it and that has yet to happen to me.Its probably THE Cash Grab of the decade on par with WarZ who just didnt have the hype train carrying them through the months. Also they also made quite a bit of money and Dean said wait they basically copied their first game and got tons of money with it? I can do that too BUT ON CONSOLE TOO. WarZ or Infestation if you want to call it was the first of a long time of game devs who saw what DayZ Mod had and wanted to steal the spotlight. Which by the way you worded the later part of it you dont realize WarZ was just updated to Infestation it was the same game lol just they changed the name. Anyways lets go down the list WarZInfestation Rust Nether there is probably more I just never payed attention to them. And like I said earlier the only reason a console version of DayZ will be possible is with the new rendering engine WHICH pushed the Dev team even more to implement it so that us PC guys can get the clearly best experience in DayZ. I honestly see no way of it being a cash grab I have no problem admitting I do fanboy over DayZ I will defend Rocket and the dev team . Why? Because everything youve said I have a reason to defend them for because youre speaking so many lies I cant tell if this is stuff youve been told or that you really just think this way. Let me ask you something youre Rocket. Youre the Creator of one of the most popular mods currently in gaming your fans ask you can you make a standalone version of DayZ? you say Okay ill see what I can do through tons of shit youve had to go through hardships your bosses at BI finally put their head on straight and say Hey Dean weve noticed that your mod has helped generate sales of ARMA  and brought attention to our franchise. I know in the past I said your mod was a bad idea but wed like to help fund it. Youll get direct access to our engine have your own team and have a budget from us. You thankfully agree so a few months go down the line the Standalone is finally released on Early Access. Later down the line again you realize there is a way to make this game run better implementing a new rendering system into our highly modified engine. Hey! Why dont we continue to open the community and experience of DayZ to the PS?!?! I hope the DayZ SA goes down quicker than I expect it to because the hype train with people like you is still defending is. Im still defending it because people like you who dont know your facts about the game are trying to make people think its terrible. When its not even to its full potential yet. Youre almost as bad as the recent Machinima review of the game who gave multiple facts of the game incorrectly.I just want to hear one FACT from you why its not a scam. Tell me how its possible for the whole team to be still behind every milestone after  months still using the same engine and still lying about it?Id love to see a good DayZFanboyStruggle again. I gave it to you  No struggle for me c If you still dont want to agree with me no problem!

1800724,0,t3_2f5ktq,Here are my thoughts. Bikes should not have motors that would be OP since it can be both fast AND quiet. Instead holding down the sprint button should speed up considerably and gradually use up the players stamina. Also different types of bikes would be cool like a regular bike being made for roads and dirt roads amd BMX bikes should help traversing offroad and be able to make bunny hops.. Nelson already said that cars will not have inventory spaces since people would start to hoard cars rather than build their own storage. BUT he said you would be able to build onto your car and also place your own storage on the vehicle which I think is better. . Solar cars would be obsolete in my opinion as you can literally find gas cans EVERYWHERE and I imagine it would take expensive material to actually build the solar panels so yeh. . Yeeeh with the current map system digging wont be possible.. I dont know about you but I cant think of a way to effectively repel zombies without making it become abusive unless Nelson adds random spawns which would suck cuz coming home with a zombie greeting you as soon as you open the door wouldnt be too pleasant.,unturned,ck64zcj,4,t5_2z01g

The lighting at sunset is overdone as is the fog which is god awful at times.It has some good points granted. But it only has maybe  well designed locations.The airfield and airstrips for example are still quite poorly designed with very little to tell them apart.Its a fun map because theres plenty of military loot pretty much all across the map except near Staroye which happens to be the  best designed town in the whole map.

Either sneak around and avoid them or just time your weapon swing well. If you get it just right you can hit them in the face just before they hit you and stunkill them then.

The player base has decided that this is what it wants and server hosters have responded.Also the criticisms of the gameplay of the game have very little to do with the addons.

Swapping the stats maybe except the magazine size would make them more realistic AND more balanced. Winwin! And in such an easy way!Whats more lots of people got hyped about the Calling Card but in its current form its just meh. That change would make it worth using as a main weapon.

I have become friends with other map makers mod makers server hosters youtubers streamers and just fellow survivors. I know the community can be a bit shitty sometimes. But there are also so much cool and kind people in it. Tbh there are  things that i truely love about unturned.  is that its one of the few free  play games that not have been made to make money. Soo its tottaly NOT pay to win. The second thing what i love about the game are the weekly updates this always keeps the game fresh and fun. Nelson thanks for this amazing game. Cheers a survivor.

The damage on death system will definitely be a great hinder to those who KOS instead of different approaches of attackassimilationetc. Maybe one of the ways to obtain ammo would be to collect a great deal of items that can only be obtained through an entire assembly line of crafting and loot gathering bringing the idea that if they want to survive against other groups they have to scavenge outwards and not just camp out at the military bases. A good base line may beAmmo magazine to be found at the basesRaw explosives gunpowder equivalent to be found at other locations. Scrap metal to be farmed from other locationsSpecific item to set ammo to Ranger ammomilitary ammo. Anyway this is sleepy rambling. Im off to bed I will read everything in the morning.

9330932,0,t1_d8xmcqn,Yeah if youd stop strawmanning me thatd be great. Im sorry that me not wanting to play with you has offended you so deeply. Furthermore Ive made friends on here. Im pretty picky about the people I talk to regularly because there are a lot of assholes like you out there and I have trouble talking to people in person because Im not good at talking. And your advice? I do play my own server and there are a couple of people that will get on with me on occasion. I dont really roleplay like writing out plots and such But I do like to pretend I can just hang out and go fishing or go hunting with a friend. I cant do that in my real life because of where I live. Theres nothing wrong with exploiting a game. Even though I personally think its cheap its not like if Yaweh was real hed be like Nah you gotta go to hell for that one.My issue is that Im not willing to stoop to that level because that takes the fun out of it for me. Thats the point of playing a game to have fun. So I just dont play with people that do that. Everybody wins right? Apparently not because youre still here being an asshole.Speaking of that why ARE you here? You said yourself you dont even like the fucking game. Nobody asked you for your help and I CERTAINLY didnt ask you for a solution to what you apparently think I think is a problem. All I wanted to do was talk about this with likeminded people. Maybe make some more friends to play with me on my server. Oh and another thing  I dont have a single problem with people killing me for my gear if thats how they want to play. This post wasnt about bandits its about metagamers. So your suggestion to play singleplayer or lock my server is irrelevant which youd know if youd bothered to ask me any questions instead of putting words in my mouth based on your prejudicial assumptions.Furthermore I AM autistic. Ive got aspergers and Im clearly more intelligent and wellmannered than you. So maybe you should think about how lowly that makes YOU. Or  bear with me here  you could stop using autism as a synonym for retarded because theyre nowhere near the same thing. If you need a comparison to see the difference just look at this conversation.,unturned,d8yri9h,1,t5_2z01g

9696138,0,t3_5dx74o,My thoughts on the weaponsZubekorev I feel like this gun should have a super fast fire rate to make it unique otherwise it feels somewhat like just another Zubeknakov Zubekloska This is the gun Id want to see replacing the current Fusilaut.Zubektockny And this is the gun Id want to see replacing the current Nightraider.Fhedarov This gun seems kind of off. Not sure how I feel about it nor do I know what it would be in the game.Vrolski This should definitely be the RussianRanger counterpart to the Desert Falcon. I think good damage range and accuracy are all things it needs. Perhaps allow sight attachments but make the damage only about  or so?Gretchen I feel like this would just be an Avenger taking Military ammo. However I could see it working as a low tier Russian Military pistol.Vendicatore This definitely should replace the Teklowvka.Then the Teklowvka should be made a bit worse given full auto and then moved to normal ranger spawns. As an added feature the Vendicatore should have  round burst and a decently sized magazine. This pistol could be a higher tier pistol found more rarely than the Gretchen but would be more common than the Vrolski. Police Taser Do I need to explain this? Hell to the yes.Groznaya If this is a shotgun its definitely needed. I think once the . shotgun system gets added back in giving it the classic  shots like the original . lever action would be a decent idea and overall giving it slightly worse stats than the bluntforce. It would be an ok starter shotgun but easily replaced with police shotguns. It would be found more rarely than the Masterkey. Viper PDW I think this should be one of the guns you can get from the scientist from the Liberator. Either that or make it a slightly less common  by  counterpart to the normal Viper.Makeshift Spear This would be a very nice addition. More makeshift weapons are always nice and a spear would be pretty unique. ,unturned,da896ot,3,t5_2z01g

This will make sure none of the Unturned files are corruptedmissing. Thats my goto solution for most issues but if that doesnt solve it.

10659301,0,t1_ddeyi5h, You spawn in a small town in Yukon. You find some clothes and some food but not a full set of clothes and no functional car. With limited food and cold damage you need to get to another town quickly to survive. As you run the moderate distance to another town your salvation you take cold damage thanks to your incomplete clothing set. As you take more damage and become closer to dying you slow down. Eventually youre at critical health and you move too slowly to ever reach the town. You lose hope and you die.Why did you die? Not through poor choices or lack of skill but simply because RNG drops did not provide you with necessary items. Is this a fun way to play a game? Where your survival is trivial and beyond your control? Better yet when you respawn this will happen again. And again. And again. And maybe even again depending on how bad your luck is.Luck !

11328550,0,t1_dfaz7dr,Please keep in mind it is a complete lie that this map was said it would be a curated one. The development team has been repeatedly making this up in the subreddit in order to gain attention of their map. In their Discord they had stated that they have contacted Nelson but he never said it would become curated. Their claims are pretty suspicious so keep your eyes peeled within their next updates and see if their story changes because they claimed on the Discord that they would be issuing an update post to clear confusion on this issue which they still havent done.,unturned,dfg2lz9,1,t5_2z01g

11575476,0,t3_657q3f,Groups ChangesYou can now set your characters main group from the survivor screen which uses the Steam groups system. When joining a server it will automatically place you into your Steam group or a group with the friends from your lobby if youre in a lobby. From there you can choose to formjoin groups using the new dynamic group features or rejoin your Steam group using a persistent invite at the top of the queue.For servers which rely on groups for teams or dont want players able to manually joinleave groups e.g. using a plugin that automatically places you into a group you can set AllowDynamicGroups in the Gameplay config file to false. This will keep the player in whichever Steam group they have selected or the group your codemods set PlayerID.Group to.Update NotesAdditions Added features to use Steam group alongside ingame groups. Added AllowDynamicGroups option to Gameplay config.Fixes Fixed missing salvage interaction after changing group. Fixed opening quests rather than players list by default. Fixed blue knight top compression. Fixed queens guard outfit compression. Fixed swashbuckler outfit compression.,unturned,dg8348u,4,t5_2z01g
