9442750,0,t3_577dcw,I just want to comment on your question for hybrid classes. I have taken  hybrid classes and I would rate two of them highly. I recently graduated with a BS in comp sci and I think two of the professors were very knowledgeable and good lecturers. I also thought they gave challenging assignments which helped me learn a lot. With the third hybrid class the lecturer seemed more interested in ending the class early so he could go home. YMMV. I enjoyed hybrid classes because I was able to connect with classmates and the professor. So it depends on what you want from the program. ,umuc,d9cxow3,1,t5_2smb6
