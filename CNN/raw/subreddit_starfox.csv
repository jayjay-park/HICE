135686,0,t1_ceszo40,I like how you can actually see Hyrule soldiers doing something for once. Nintendo has always been about making each game different from the last which is how theyve been able to innovate so much and make some of the most amazing games like Ocarina of Time.,starfox,cetvuqx,1,t5_2stwp

3873920,0,t3_34snnb,It just seems to miss the point of the original piece.  The bass drum is way too prominent and overbearing when that voice should be more harmonic.  The snare part only incorporates the accents rather than any of the rolls in between.It just seems unbalanced and unfinished.  I love the idea but I just think it needs some more work.,starfox,cqxuyw5,3,t5_2stwp

6805038,0,t3_48xn4w,I wouldnt say that they couldnt because they definitely could. Productsafety has different degrees of standards and they didnt want to proceed because it wasnt suitable for children.

7270595,0,t3_4exkos,Its a shame Nintendo has almost entirely ignored the awesome soundtrack from the SNES game. I agree the music in SF was a big disappointment for me coming from the amazing rockmetalinspired songs of original plus those unique pieces that lended themselves well to the sound chip. Heres hoping that someday they decide to return to both the musical style and graphical style.,starfox,d24m8fk,1,t5_2stwp

7377549,0,t1_d2gly24,Arcade mode is great. Its not evident how many paths there are when playing in story mode but arcade mode shows how well Nintendo crafted the split paths in the game. There are  total paths and each ones score is tracked. Its pretty neat and kinda motivates you to figure out which route is the best.,starfox,d2grxzp,1,t5_2stwp

7415261,0,t3_4gv8z9,Yep you pretty much got it. The retro Arwing Fox makes your charge shots stronger but removes lockon. The black Arwing Falco lets you lock on twice but you take much more damage.,starfox,d2l2f9l,1,t5_2stwp
7418970,0,t3_4gwvv3,Its not necessary no. To be honest nearly  hours put into it I havent felt like the whole CUS business works the way it used to anyway. Dont quite understand the mechanics of the golden  Hits and such yet.Whats more useful for just the base gold medal scores is that when you have hyper lasers you can lock on to two targets and once and fire two shots which is very handy for the sections where you have to destroy X amount of targets in X amount of time especially on Corneria .Dont forget the bonus points as well. If the other three members of your team finish with  health theyll each give you  points for a total bonus of .,starfox,d2lhly0,1,t5_2stwp
7430222,0,t1_d2lwfdr,Yeah the whole story and alternate route thing was what made  unique and the ability to play any mission you want kind of cancels that. However if you only played Arcade mode I would always go Aquarosa route because I personally do not want to play Zoness. At all. Hey its all different strokes for different folks right?,starfox,d2mrp52,1,t5_2stwp
7478904,0,t1_d2qesxp,Did not know you could do this. Took the game to my dads which started a new file with intentions tonplay through together but it wouldnt give us the option even. ,starfox,d2sb48v,1,t5_2stwp

7866342,0,t3_4n2ejd,I have to agree with some aspects with this such as the medals being overly cryptic or the lack of levels and branches.  However there are a few things it gets wrong such as the number of original bosses.Overall the game made some poor decisions but its still a step up from the post stuff weve been getting.,starfox,d408ziu,8,t5_2stwp
8175500,0,t3_4r4oao,Bounty Hunters usually operate outside of the law. The only one I can think of right off the bat is Kursed from one of the Command endings. We are technically not given much information of Kurseds alignment since depending on the actions of the player she may never exist.Its worth noting that Star Fox themselves are a mercenary team and like bounty hunters are slightly outside of the law though commissioned by the Cornerian military. It may both be the lone aspect of bounty hunters that gives this negative connotation or the fact that theyre simply hired by the wrong sorts of people.,starfox,d4zhjsl,5,t5_2stwp
8681199,0,t3_4yunck,I think there is a huge legal hurdle with Argonaut games or whoever now owns the rights to their properties. Its similar to why goldeneye  wasnt included in rare reply on the xbone. If Nintendo was the only party involved if be much simpler.,starfox,d6qrvv4,2,t5_2stwp

9312437,0,t1_d8wct1l,I agree with you on the great soundtrack but a lot of the times I felt it didnt fit the mood such as the Star Wolf theme sounded more like a slow tango instead of a dogfight and the menu music sounded way too cheery.,starfox,d8wf4ic,1,t5_2stwp
