Comcast is running a promo right now where you can get Mbps with Blast! up to Mbps for .mo before tax and fee. Edit Unfortunately Vacaville is fairly well dominated by ATampT and Comcast. So it really boils down to dealing with ATampTs fairly low speeds suppar customer service and high prices.... Or go with Comcast and their ridiculously fast speeds shittier customer service and prices that almost double after the month promo. Easy to get around that. At  months go in and cancel service then open it up again the same day for a new promo. ,vacaville,cye1099,1,t5_2tv8w
