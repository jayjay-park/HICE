When you open an app it starts at  if you raise it to  it needs to raise the master volume to . However if you would like to raise the volume of an app above the master volume you can easily detach it from the master volume by right clicking its icon. right now if you detach an app it wont respond to the keyboard keys such as mute we are trying to figure out how to improve functionality.
