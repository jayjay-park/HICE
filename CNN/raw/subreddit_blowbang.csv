1398698,0,t1_cgn2g0u,I know this is an old comment but here goes. I work in the antipiracy industry. Most of what we know about the cause of piracy is in result to two things Pricing AvailabilityIf a product is priced higher in one market than in another it will likely be pirated. If a product is available in one market but not in others it will likely be pirated. If a product is being pirated heavily then its likely priced higher than the markets priceelasticity. Id be more than happy to talk more about alternative payment methods that can help bring these two axes in line with market demand. PM me if youd like. ,blowbang,cirlvo0,1,t5_2vmp2
