1389967,0,t3_2a19y8,Here is mineThe story about the Minecraft name UltimatePorkManMy story starts in  I started playing a crackedfree version of minecraft. I started building steampunky flying fortresses and stuff in creative. Till the point I found out you could spawn animals. I found out there were pigs O I got absolutelly impressed by them and fell in love. By that time I somehow didnt know it was possible to get drops out of animals. One day I was building a farm and made some animal pens including a very big pig pen with brown wool as mud carrots were not in the game yet so I used wheat to feed them. There were  pigs in them Oink Digger and Bacon. That day was the day I came up with my name. I was planning on buying Minecraft pretty soon but did not have a proper name yet. Till I accidentally killed Oink that day and it dropped pork. I felt sorry for Oink and made a grave for him. I saved his pork in a special chest which I put in a safe which I specially built for Oink. I had the feeling that pigs were rare and thought I hadnt done enough for Oink to honor him. So I came up with UltimatePorkMan. Why? Here is why Ultimate  Oink was the Ultimate pig.Pork  He dropped his lovely PorkMan  Because I am a man not a women.Since then I have called myself UltimatePorkMan and Today I have the extra name Porky. I love my name and will never change it.R.I.P. Oink ,corenet,ciqii3k,4,t5_2y6yd

5184085,0,t3_3lhugy,Glad youre keeping things going like this. It would suck to loose everyone to the wind. I plan to stick around and see what things pop up.Just a suggestion...take the server address out of the sidebar. No point giving a dead address.  Maybe advertise the Steam group there instead.,corenet,cvaveth,1,t5_2y6yd
