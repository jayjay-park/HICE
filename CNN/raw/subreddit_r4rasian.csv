10880989,0,t3_5viao7,I dont understand why people act like is cool to not have Kik. If you message someone there and things start getting weird or uncomfortable you block and move on. And if worst comes to worst you make a new Kik. Its really safe and easy. Youre really doing yourself a disservice. ,r4rasian,de2aox6,7,t5_389bs
