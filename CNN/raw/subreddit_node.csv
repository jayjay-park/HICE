Tarballs exist on a master filesystem that may be mirrored by anyone. If the bottleneck is reads why not distribute this work across mirrors? Linux package managers dont get mentioned much in the debate but distributed package mirrors with a thin registry are much more scalable and resilient model than retaining packages in your database.,node,cexjm6p,5,t5_2reca

1630908,0,t1_cjkl1p8,Were actually experimenting with having the whole app flock in one fat repos. Mostly for compatibility and code sharing. Push to master on main repo will get pulled to a master machine that then builds amp tests stuff and distributes to the different servers application CDN db migrations etc. This way you can try to make sure that there are no versioning problems.Were not sure if it is a really practical approach for one it means that minor frontend changes could result in application server restarts but we have some logic to check that.I see this reply only adds to the confusion but it illustrates that every approach has pros and cons.One thing I do know is that it can be very handy to spend some time setting up a solid central deployment system and automate everything with hooks into the reposes and then do continuous deployment. You can add a nice layer of verification logic and processing that is incredibly powerful. You pay for it in complexity but such is life.This also allows to have split projects each own repos but still pull it to a central place and combine or process things for deployment. Eg if front end code changes the build bot can push it to CDN andor notify the servers to flush their local caches and start pulling the new files.,node,cjkqosp,1,t5_2reca

I ask because each node process is capped at .GB ram a limitation from vs use in Chromechromium.Some people get around that by using cluster but Walmarts strategy including for Black Friday is to containerize the application running a single instance of the server giving each GB.  See Although Id recommend going with nginx or HAProxy over Apache the basic premise is the same run something thatll handle  and upstream to one of many instances.

Many things mentions by others are simply not true about NoSql...its regurgitated by things they have read combined with a misunderstanding about NoSql themselves. However if you do not understand data and have no experience with databases and you are building an important app you should probably stay away from NoSql. You really really have to know what you are doing and most people do not...hence why they come to the conclusion that NoSql cannot be used for anything important...

5633312,0,t1_cwv30on,gt When Apache gets a request to run a PHP file it hands that request to its interpreter module which spins up a new thread and fulfills the request. This thread spinning up is very costly  giving the computer a limited amount of concurrent threads it can spin up per second before it is no longer able to successfully spin up threads either because of file handles CPU time memory etc..this isnt quite accurate assuming MPM and php module as opposed to CGI in server rightsizing you configure your spare and max child processes and threads per child are allocated from the start.  php will then allocate its memory on demand and doesnt release the memory back to the OS until the apache child process is cycled which is configurable.  this means thats once spun up with a stable production load most of the server ram is allocated and nothing has be to forked and reallocated for several thousand requests or more if the codebase is very stable no memory leaks.  it takes some understanding of the workload to get this right.the primary advantage of using NGIX is that your static content images CSS client side js files etc can be served by ngix directly and benefit from its caching.  You can still do that with apachephp though either with a more trim apache install or with ngix in front of apache too.  you dont see it often because apache is pretty good about bypassing modules when serving static content and the threads are already started and waiting anyway. You DO see it server farms though.its really just a design choice that node runs this way.  php was designed single threaded as CGI and apache and IIS modules.  node was designed as single running process with threading capabilities.  one could conceivably make node work via CGI or even via an apache module but it works so well stand alone that theres no real reason to do so and doing so would means you still need some standalone process for websockets anyway so it makes lots of sense to have one process do both.,node,cwvd6ch,3,t5_2reca

Im assuming youre using windows  from here on out. Open your Start menu rightclick My Computer and select Properties. Select Advanced system settings and open Environment Variables. Youll see User variables for your name and a row with PATHS in the Variable column select that row and click Edit.... If the Variable value field is empty then add Cnode otherwise add Cnode to the end. Now when ever youre in CMD and you run node your computer will check Cnode for the node.exe  so create a folder on your C drive named node and paste your node.exe into it.Youll be running your scripts in your CMD  know how to use it if you dont. Example press the Windows key and R and open cmd youll have your CMD open likely in your user folder maybe CUsersYourName. Add your test.js file into that directory of yours go back to your CMD and enter node test.js to run it. If your file is in another directory specify its location or cd to that directory.Hope this helps.,node,d2uvrxg,1,t5_2reca

9793369,0,t3_5fgl8a,As you may know in a synchronous program a method call will not return until it has totally done the thing it wanted to. To be able to do things concurrently you create a thread which is an abstraction provided by the operating system over multiple tasks happening at the same time.Lets say we want to download  different files concurrently. We spin up  different threads and theyre all blocking  our hypothetical download function is not returning until the file is totally downloaded.The OS has to keep track of all  threads and so periodically picks one up looks at it checks if its ready to run and then puts it down. It does this continually over all of them until one is ready to resume and then it resumes that one for a bit interspersing executing it with checking the others. For each download function it will never be able to resume until the outside world does something to it. So its futile checking the thread for the first few seconds after it ran because the download wont have finished completing. The only time its worth checking is right after the file has finished downloading or to put it another way until the outside world has finished sending the whole file.In eventloop and asynchronous systems like node the responsibility of interacting with the outside world is handed off to the environment. Programmers write code in the style of Do this and when this happens do this  responding to events. This means there are no threads to pick up periodically the event loop simply keeps track of what events are happening and which callbacks to line up for execution.Scalability is a vague word that means a lot of things to a lot of people but lets assume you mean concurrency capacity or the ability of a single system to do lots of things at the same time. While there are a few others which Im sure others will speak to I would say the main win is that theres no longer any time wasted checking on threads that arent ready to do anything. Time that would be wasted switching a thread context which takes a long time in CPU land can instead be spent executing your code. Theres actually much smarter logic than this but the general principle holds. More threads  more overhead.,node,dak8tvy,2,t5_2reca

10071848,0,t3_5k08yj,So you need to track your users session state on the server. Typically youd use a database for this but in this case well keep it simple. Essentially you need the client to hang onto a session ID that it gives to the server every time it communicates with the server then you use that ID to look up the user session state.You dont want to use cookies which are really the right thing to use in this scenario you set a cookie with the session ID then you just retrieve that session ID from the cookie since cookies are automatically sent in the request headers from the client.But without cookies your next best option is to redirect your client to have a session ID in their URL query string then look that up on every request.For example. Client loads . . You generate session ID  for the client.. You redirect the client to ?sid.. When the client submits the form you check their sid query property and store your variables on your backend. Then you redirect them to page?sid.. Continue for however many pages you plan to do.The main downside to this approach is that the user might not realize the significance of the session ID and therefore might delete it but if your site resets all their selections after doing so they will probably leave it alone in the future. Plus users have gotten used to not messing with the contents of the URL box. ,node,dbkdue7,2,t5_2reca

Unless your main goal is to avoid having people question your choices because you are afraid you might look bad if your decisions dont match their predetermined best practices.Express is old fashioned.  And to a certain degree so is Postgres although many people are afraid to say they lest they be accused of not being a real database programmer.

But are you a real enterprise developer?  Because if you were then I would assume you already gave your right nut to Oracle.,node,dc09c4h,3,t5_2reca

10588984,0,t3_5rhin4,ES and ES features. The most important one is asyncawait. You can now write code without callbacks or Promises it will look like synchronous code but be asynchronous.If you do want to go the asyncawait route which you should I would recommend taking a look at Koa instead of using Express. There are pretty much the same but Koa v uses asyncawait and it makes writing middleware much nicer. You do not need to transpile anything to use the latest features. If youre using Node v you can use the harmony flag and use all the latest stuff. If you use the nightly build of Node v you can do everything without the harmony flag. WakeskaterX mentioned  it is a great resource. Next to each entry is a little grey circle with a question mark that gives a code example. ,node,dd867wc,1,t5_2reca
10597097,0,t1_dd8tphw,You missed an important part of the article concerning active cache architectures where any requests not found in cache are automatically forwarded to a much slower backend to see if the record exists there.So if you wanted to DDOS the slower backend service you would intentionally flood the service with requests for badinvalid keys.  That way every request goes to the slow amp expensive backend and if you do it quickly enough the system will be crippled.This solution is elegant because any real keys that actually exist now include a digital signature.  This way you can discard any invalidbad requests before they are sent to the slow back end.To your point if a cache lookup truly is quicker than a cryptographic validation then just do the cache lookup first and then check the signature if the cache misses.  The point is intentional cache misses will not be forwarded to the slow backend.,node,dd90c4t,5,t5_2reca

11056731,0,t1_dej6xtj,gt Nodes asyncness means that it doesnt wait until the previous line is finished to move on unlike say PHP.This isnt technically accurate. Node does wait for the previous line to finish. The difference is that when youre say downloading a file it doesnt wait for the file to finish downloading before returning. That is a download function only queues a download it doesnt wait until the download is done.Im sure I could have worded that better.,node,del9fz9,1,t5_2reca

Another option is cogenerators but now that we have asyncawait you dont really need that anymore either.  ,node,dexjurh,1,t5_2reca

It looks here like without doing that it will automatically match the request origin which is probably a problem since my front and backend end are running on different ports and will then run on different domains plus the backend is supposed to be accessible as an API to the public.EDIT thinking more about it the ports shouldnt matter if domain matching were the culprit this should be working since both are localhost. plus Im trying to using CORS to allow public access from any domain.
