986568,0,t1_chga9ib,Oh god I have to rewatch this show. I dont even remember some of the names you mentioned. I think Id have to see their faces to remember. I agree on the Aiden part. Id have to watch it again though to make a proper argument on the specifics you mentioned. So Ill just generalize this. I think its a bit unfair to blame a murder based on a person who didnt do it just because heshe was the one that caused the event to unfold. Like faux Amandas death. Yes its because of Emily that shes in that situation. However she wasnt the crazy the guy that actually set out to murder her. She didnt tell Amanda to steal the laptop either. Or Pascals death. Impersonating the FBI lead Conrad to kill Pascal. But Emily didnt push him to his death. It would be like asking someone to get you something in a store. If someone shoots him dead there it would be unfair to blame yourself for that death because you asked him to go there. Its a fine line. I do agree that she isnt your typical good person. Anyone who embarks on revenge is knowingly dedicating their life to hate. The ideal good person will forgive or use the law like a fair trial you mentioned for justice. There isnt an ideal good person. Emily is too messed up to even be one. But she isnt a bad person. Because despite everything she still has some sort of moral compass to stop herself from going to far. In contrasts to the Graysons. They will kill without a second thought. I think Ill change my mind if she killed Daniel as revenge for killing Victoria. I also agree that she shouldnt have happy ending. It wouldnt be realistic. ,revenge,chgfid6,1,t5_2qk9p

She stole his laptop for the whole framing shenanigans testified against him in court got his daughter institutionalized etc. etc. Its gonna be tough for the writers to pull something out of their asses and make the storyline work.

3741880,0,t1_cqisbkc,But Victoria would not really win its just that they both would have gotten their revenge on each other.  Victoria was stripped of everything and she killed herself so Emilys revenge was complete but Victoria will also get her revenge on Emily destroying her.  They kept saying Shes planning something why doesnt she give the drive to the FBI?  Because she knew Emily would try to steal it I bet theres footage of the attack in the garage they wouldnt have checked because Victoria said she hurt herself but I think that was the reason for the vicious kick which was unnecessary it showed a pure hatred for her and she knew it would.  Im sure there will also be footage of Emily impersonating a fireman she took her head piece off in the hall for goodness sake.  But the drive implicates everyone opening up for all of them to go to jail I think Emily will admit to all of it and then sacrifice herself to help the ones she love thus she does end the cycle of revenge but she only will do so by dying.  Anyway thats my theory.,revenge,cqisrp5,6,t5_2qk9p
