36140,0,t1_ceiiwap,You can take your bleeding heart and fuck off.There is no excuse  no extenuating circumstances no history no reason  for going out getting pissed and king hitting someone or beating someone senseless for no other reason than they were in the same street as you.Both the fuckwits mentioned  Packer and Loveridge  CHOSE to go out and do what they did. Nobody forces people to get drunk. Claiming to be sick because of problems with alcohol are no excuse.And before you claim it is and decry my statement  I do know what Im talking about. Im not going to say why but I know all about the perils of alcohol and the CHOICE to ignore them.I strongly suspect the magistrate on Packers case agrees with me having now heard his judgement  he would have put him away for longer if the charge allowed but two years without chance of parole was the most he could do. Pity the dumb bastard who sentenced Loveridge didnt have the same pair of stones. Cowardly and deplorable were amongst the terms Magistrate Grogan used.So yeah you can just take your bleeding heart and excuses for thugs and stick em where the sun dont shine.,nrl,ceijo7x,-9,t5_2qn90

838182,0,t1_cgziv7i,I used to care. It felt epic and meaningful but  a lot of things have eroded that  QLD dominance for me isnt one of them however. Picking Kiwis has ruined it big time. Sure im a biased Kiwi and would love to see Papalii and Tamou wearing black but as someone who used to buy into the state against state thing seeing Tamou and others running out there massively ruins the appeal of Origin. The damage to the integrity of the concept is irrevocable. It also has too strong a negative influence on the regular season. It wrecks about  weeks where shit teams get wins they wouldnt have got and good teams get beaten cause their spine isnt playing. Id love to know how it affects each clubs bottom line. Its quite farcical.  Also the media circus bores me. Every time a NSW eligible player has a good game theyre talking about picking him for Origin. Meanwhile Mal probably picked his team  months ago. Theres plenty of reasons for this im not trying to act like QLD have shitloads to pick from the team kinda picks itself tbh so NSWs number of options is a huge factor here. But the media is hysterical.I used to care but a bunch of things have conspired together to successfully make me not care anymore. The games themselves are still good on their own merits but the magic isnt there anymore for me. Its very sad. ,nrl,cgzjyjw,8,t5_2qn90

I think part of the reason players are so in the refs face is because they are getting simple things wrong so often and momentum can easily be stolen away by that.

1814736,0,t1_ck7uo8l,I think you missed my meaning.Im  in favor of giving the minor prem a significant benefit but the doublechance as currently executed really isnt a double chance at all  its a play for position sort of thing. The doublechance is completely gone after the first week of games.Worse yet in the AFL it has consistently resulted in Preliminary Finals that are either vv or vv...so what exactly was the point of the doublechance anyways?There are drawbacks to every finals system. IMO with any number above a McIntyre Top  you get into some pretty muddy water games that end up feeling meaningless teams that make the finals but have no realistic chance limited incentives etc.Honestly I think a  or team knockout bracket is better than this. In a simple team bracket  get byes but  gets a tired opponent. With a team bracket the advantage to the minor premier is clear.With the AFL amp NRL I think  singleelimination would work great. Assess the byes early the advantage of rest shows in Week  and then youve got Preliminary Finals where everyone is on even footing. More teams are involved in finals and at the higher end of the spectrum theres even some jockeying for top  or top  position.At the end of the day its not a bad system  as long as its not a simple n bracket. Byes are a great incentive.tldr  for a hot dog?,nrl,ck7uvh8,1,t5_2qn90

I think the lows were the last two games  only had to dig deep and win ONE of them against the cellar dwellers and we would have made the eight.You can include Hayne leaving in the lows  Im still coming to terms with that.What were their best and worst performances?The worst was clearly the  spanking we got early in the year. It was absolutely insipid. The best was the game against Manly close to the end of the season  all grit and some damn fine play.Biggest disappointmentPeats getting injured and out for the last half of the year. That was a turning point.And Hayne bailing. Nuff said.Areas of ImprovementDefense. Which plainly sucked for most of the year. They need to learn how to wrap someone up in a tackle  some of the games the opposition team had so may offloads the scoreboard ran out of room to list them.Who should they target?Honestly no idea. If Folau was even a remote chance of coming back to league they should be at him like flies on a lump of shit  but I dont think he is.More poke up front would be nice  Hindy junior has promise but we need someone more like Fui in his prime to stiffen the forwards. PredictionNo better than th as much as it breaks my heart to say it. Its going to take time to find someone to replace Hayne or to get someone up to even close to Haynes level and without that were going to be back to shit again.I think were in for another heartbreaking year.

2422424,0,t1_cmb2qea,Also many American colleges do have a Rugby Union as a sport even if it is not as popular as the traditional American games. especially the ones with a EuropeanBritish foundation so Union already has a much easier foothold in the traditional route of Sport professionalism in the USA which is College sport. Plus although they are ranked th in Union globally compared to th in League there difference in the level of international competition means their th place is probably more highly accoladed than the th ranking. Union has also a great foothold in Canada and South America which opens it up for America much easier. League is better of developing the AUSPAC region to begin with before expanding that far and risking that much money. Union has the money and connections to sustain a popular exhibition style sporting event in America while it works out its tactics. The NRL though does need to do the Manly v Canberra game in China because the sponsors are the ones willing to pay for it and it will expose them to a massive MASSIVE market. ,nrl,cmb4c0f,4,t5_2qn90

Its solely about the TV ratings because theyre the biggest club in each state and whilst it isnt surprising its still annoying.

He hasnt missed a game in four seasons whereas Cornish has missed  of those games. He is also a qualified electrician so he can help repair Brookvale.

She isnt advocating for laws to strip character references. She is just pointing out the reality of how difficult it is for someone who was raped to face the person who theyre saying did it in court and that having the head of Souths a mayor a priest and a consular general come out to say the punishment is an injustice doesnt help the already disturbingly low rates of conviction.These people were not called in to be witnesses they were trying to get the sentence downgraded.,nrl,cpzkodi,3,t5_2qn90

Im sick of being treated like I am some form of idiot for trusting in these rules even though the rules are what the officiating should be based upon.Im sick of getting frustrated with the commentaries that I hear on the television for games having a clear and blatant bias towards one of the teams playing and ignoring anything even the rules and referees if they go against the team that they are supporting that game.Quiet frankly The NRL community makes the League of Legends community look like well adjusted polite adults in comparison which is just disappointing on so many levels.,nrl,cq1pago,2,t5_2qn90

Also Im quite happy to admit that league isnt perfect and there are a few players Id like to see out of the game because they want to hurt people insted of play good football. I dont defend that. Look at what you are defending.Whats the difference between that and Vatuvai hammering Slater a few weeks ago. Billy wasnt braced for impact didnt see him coming and stayed on the ground for quite a while probably hoping he didnt pick up a major injury? I dont see you calling that  be banned. Im defending professionals who know exactly what  they are in for when they play against some of the best athletes on the planet. Sports at that level always have a high risk of injury yet Ive never seen someone seriously injured from someone taking a specky on their shoulder. And I seriously doubt players think they have a major injury most of them probably think fuck that guy just embarrassed megt Edit nice try  people going for the ball refs call. Now if either of them copped a shoulder to the head off the ball while they were focused in the catch Id want someone banned for a year minimum.If someone in the AFL shouldered someone in the head they would be banned for a long time as well. ,nrl,cqcxbiv,1,t5_2qn90

3768482,0,t1_cqlty05,NRL.com write upAfter seven rounds of the  Telstra Premiership season the Warriors and Titans cant be split sitting tied on  records with a points differential of minus three.That suggests this clash  which will open the NRLs fivegame spectacular on Anzac Day  will be a close one despite the fact that the Gold Coast havent beaten the Warriors in five years.Coach Andrew McFadden has made a statement by dropping boom centre Konrad Hurrell following a spate of errors over the past few weeks with David Fusitua the direct replacement. Veteran prop Sam Rapira returns while backrower Raymond FaitalaMariner comes in to make his debut and become Warrior number .For the visitors the loss of Dave Taylor to suspension is a major one but is offset to some degree by the return of captain Nate Myles in an otherwise settled lineup.The New Zealand side blew the chance to record a valuable away win against the Cowboys last week with errors yet again their downfall.The Titans on the other hand were boosted by a second consecutive plus point victory last Saturday at home to the Panthers.Watch out Warriors Ruck defence cost the Warriors dearly last week as the Cowboys destroyed them from the play the ball on numerous occasions. Three tries from North Queensland hooker Jake Granville plus  metres and two line breaks sums up just how bad the Warriors were in that area of the contest. They can illafford a repeat against a Titans side with talented forwards and livewire rake Kierran Moseley coming off the bench.Ball control is another area of improvement. The New Zealanders dropped the ball at the start and end of their sets and even dropped it once over the line to blow a certain try. Sixteen errors in total saw the Warriors retain their mantle as the NRLs most errorridden side and ensured that all their effort in North Queensland ultimately went to waste.   Watch out Titans They left the stadium with the two points against the Panthers but the Gold Coast struggled to control the ball and completed at only  per cent last weekend. On top of that they missed  of their  tackles and allowed their opponents to offload on  occasions.Warriors coach Andrew McFadden sounded an ominous warning to his troops this week by unceremoniously dropping Konrad Hurrell due to poor form. Fear factor should encourage the Warriors to be much improved in their ball control and execution this week and coupled with the return of Rapira and Fusitua it should mean a tough day at the office for the Gold Coast.Key MatchUp Solomone Kata v William Zillman. In his new home in the centres Zillman was arguably the best Titan on the park last week running for a huge  metres with a line break and two tries to boot. Kata was almost as good in a beaten side against the Cowboys scoring a try breaking the line three times and carrying the ball on  occasions for  metres.  The History Played  Warriors  Titans . The Warriors are shooting for a ninthstraight victory over the Titans this weekend having won every headtohead clash against the Gold Coast since September . Auckland has never been a happy hunting ground for the Titans either with only two wins out of seven visits in total.Did You Know The Titans will become the first club other than the Storm to play the Warriors on Anzac Day since . Coincidently the Gold Coast were the last outfit to face the Warriors prior to their sixyear tradition of clashing with Melbourne on April  winning that game  in their inaugural  season.,nrl,cqlu1y1,2,t5_2qn90

One time I was in Target and this girl at a register started flirting with me while she was serving another customer because I had a Slipknot shirt on.

3942033,0,t3_35lcwe,There are a few articles like this doing the rounds from rugby league journalists. For fans who think the media isnt an enemy of the game the reaction in the media to this incident should force you to reconsider.I read an article yesterday on one of these sites and the journalist compared Korbin Sims actions to Sam Burgess Paul Gallen and Jaiman Lowe maliciously squeezing opposition players testicles. Theyre making it out be some malicious unprovoked onfield attack and not two mates and exteam mates having a laugh. Its obviously unusual as fuck but wanting him to be punished for that is only about  step away from fining players for patting the opposition or a team mate on the arse. ,nrl,cr5mizu,9,t5_2qn90

On the way down there was a few people cheering and yelling go tiges and so on. And there was the usual blokes set up on the corner with a BBQ got a fucking awesome sausage sandwich with cheese and onion just outside the ground.And at the ground I splashed out and got seated tickets. Had a good view not a whole lot at the ground so the lines werent long for drinks. At Leichhardt you are right on top of the players. You can see the massive size of for example Dave Taylor up close and hear the hits and the calls from the players.Then leaving the ground walking back up to Darling StBalmain Rd back to the pubs there was the same chanting and talking shit about the game and the players with strangers. Then kicked on in Balmain and had a good night out. And randomly ran into other Tigers fans late at night and got to talk shit again. Was great.I cant see what else fans would want. The transport was fine for me getting there they served full strength grog that was cheaper than the same drink at the pub later on. I had a seat I got to yell at players and I know they could hear me and it was allround comfortable.Only shit thing was they ran out of full strength Jim Beam but charged the same price for midstrength.

The ball can be caught in front of the passer and its still not a forward pass depending on the velocities of the passing player and the ball not the receiving player. Whether it is forwards or not depends on the individual case.Jennings getting tackled is similar to the last example in the video just after . He stops moving forwards because of the tackle but the ball continues on its passing motion.

Cant remember the guys name but there was a knockon called when a guy caught the ball got smashed by Aubo and juggled the ball but kept it in his mits.   Later on... cant even remember why but there was a weird panalty blown against the Panthers when they were finally getting a tiny bit of steam.    Im a Roosters fan and we dominated. However IMO this brings up some parallels with Origin. A couple of bad calls can turn a close game where one teams probably going to win by a modest gap into a shellacking.  ,nrl,ct05jrx,1,t5_2qn90

The driver accidentally hit and killed a young boy who ran out in front of the car on a main road. An angry mob surrounded the car pulled both driver AND passenger out of the car and killed them.

With appropriate data mining techniques particularly ensuring depth of sample data one could divine the demographic makeup of each teams followers.Demos will show you sex age socioeconomic status etc in thousands.

4913065,0,t1_cudf3tw,. Purposely punting to avoid big returns is smart but only in certain situations. However when the punt out of bounds would leave the opposing team with good field position like on Haynes returns your better off letting a return happen in case your unit can make a big play i.e. stop for short gain forced fumble.. Before the team that is punting has a chance to regain possession somebody on the return team would have to touch the ball. So usually the only chance is if the returner fumbles. If someone on the punting team touches the ball first then the play stops and the ball is placed wherever they touched it.,nrl,cudtttr,1,t5_2qn90

As far as I can tell the last time he was charged was in July which would give him  points carry over which should have gone away by now. If thats correct then hed get  points for the charge plus  loading for the previous similar charge and minus the  discount for a guilty plea and hed be at  points and free to play next week unless he has prior nonsimilar charges and that loading can stack with the similar one not sure on that point.tldr Id be very surprised if he did miss next week,nrl,cuzzqwa,8,t5_2qn90

5321145,0,t3_3nw9yj,Sooo seems my life has just taken a turn for the worst. Ill try and make a long story short. When I was in my late teens and early s I was a fucking idiot. Just a loose cunt that got fucked up way too often and did stupid shit. I saw a guy out one night who my sister had had an incident with. It was about  months after I found my dad dead and I was absolutely off the rails. One thing led to another and he and his mate went to hospital. They pressed charges and I avoided jail by the skin of my teeth. Ended up on an intensive corrections order that involved  months of community service a complete alcohol ban and reporting to the parole office every second week. Theyd rock up to my house and breath test me on random days at random hours. It was a long  months and a massive wake up call. My life changed in those  months and Im not the dude I was back then. So anyway I finished the order a while back and I thought it was done. Finished. I fucked up big time and I paid my price. Time to move forward. Well yesterday I get a letter saying that hes been awarded  victims of crime compensation. Itll be halved between me and my mate that was also charged so thats a k bill to the government that I got dropped on my head yesterday. I fucked up. I did the wrong thing. I thought that Id served my sentence and that I was past it now. Got a family and a house and shit now and its popped its head back up to fuck with me again. Dont think Ive ever regretted anything as much as I regret that night. My dumb actions are likely gonna haunt me forever. But also fuck the guy. Not getting in to what he did so Ill just say if he did it to anyone you cared about then youd do the same thing. ,nrl,cvru74t,20,t5_2qn90

5325028,0,t3_3nyfb5,Because news.com.augt SAM Burgess has been told to go back where he came from  rugby league.gt The English rugby experiment has endured a nightmare Rugby World Cup which has seen England eliminated from its own tournament after three matches and resulted in coach Stuart Lancasters decision to drop him from the Three Lions final Pool A match against Uruguay on Sunday morning in Manchester.gt On the same day BlameBurgess became a social media phenomenon in which the former Rabbitohs star was accused of being the cause for Englands disastrous Rugby World Cup campaign Burgess was told by the English press its time to abandon his failed rugby codeswitch.gt Lancaster earlier this week denied reports linking Burgess with a return to rugby league in the NRL or Super League club Leeds Rhinos while Burgess coach at Premiership Rugby club Bath Mike Ford today declared Burgess intends to stay in rugby until the next World Cup in Japan in .gt Ford said Burgess will extend his contract with Bath for a further two years and target the  World Cup as a backrower.gt Burgess signed a threeyear deal with Bath until the end of  when he moved from South Sydney to the English rugby club.gt Proving he is an international backrower is the big challenge now for Sam Ford told The Times.gt Hes always been a No.  for us no question. Weve talked about next time the England squad gets selected his goals got to be to be there as a six.gt The last conversation I had with him he was going to extend his contract with us and he wanted to go for the next World Cup. He is going to play for us for the next few years. He loves rugby union he is settled in Bath and he knows he is a six.gt He said to me I know I am a six. He enjoys being a six he enjoys the game better because he is more involved.gt Burgess apparent decision to fight for redemption at rugbys next showpiece event hasnt silenced his critics.gt Telegraph writer Oliver Brown said this weekends Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford is where Burgess belongs.gt In the man game he remains admired to the point of idolatry with Australian tourists still approaching him in Bath to sign their redandmyrtlegreen Souths jerseys Brown wrote.gt In union sad as it is to relate he is little more than a political football.gt With every tiny misstep he only becomes more polarising a source of resentment among union aficionados who believe he was too hastily fasttracked to Test level and a sacred cow to league disciples who regard any questioning of his judgment as tantamount to heresy.gt He is the unwitting lightning rod for every qualm and criticism of this raw England team. Hence the Blame Burgess phenomenon spreading like wildfire in leagues core constituencies.gt There is no shame in this but his union dream has just not come to fruition. It might seem premature to judge him so definitively within a year of his switch but not when he painted a successful home World Cup as the pinnacle of his aspirations.gt There is an eminently good reason why betting has been suspended on a Burgess move to Leeds Rhinos and why Australian pundits are openly forecasting his return to NRL. League is where he bleeds.gt It is the environment where his talents are universally appreciated where he can flourish in the knowledge that his very presence will not stoke perpetual controversy.,nrl,cvsc1ew,6,t5_2qn90

AKA the teams subreddits rrabbitohs rmelbournestorm rcanterburybulldogs etc. ye brah. Maybe a Team Of The Week for the team that played the best during that week. The mods select which team to advertise and put them as a sticky or announcement. Most subs are pretty dead. Wait... I just got another idea. Maybe you could do a player of the week and have the thread filled with info on the player and stickied and the subscribers could discuss him. Oi thats good... Actually Im gonna do that. Ill do it on my sub. Dont worry boys I got this.Restrict all communication on the sub to emoji charactersBetter quality shitposts. Ban sledges against sharks. Interactive? Game calendar for all league games including SL NSWQLD cup CRL internationals etc. Forces participation in nonnrl game threads. More off season game threads for different sports cricketnbanfleplnhl etc. Maybe one a week vote for which match to highlight.Needs more cowbellsMore Konrad Hurrell videosLet the punting stay in its own subreddit. The injokes are fine but they have a tendency to make the sub less accessible to new people. Tone it down a bit otherwise this place risks becoming a jolly clique of about a dozen people and a bunch of outsiders. Oh and dreadlocks on white guys is like super creepy man.More in between comps such as the D PremMore frequent sledge threadsPeople need to upvote threads motrless reg more dreadlockAll good Get rid of Manly supportersNothingNot much actually. Happy friendly sub great people.I like it the way it is it is the funniest sub on Reddit. Maybe if the Mods could be more aware of including casual users of the sub if they make a comment give them a response etc dont just shine the spotlight on the flaired up Senior Cits of the sub all the time. It can be quite intimidating for long time lurkers to post and then be ignored. Also there have been various comments made by users they dont want the sub to expand but Newbs are in the sub because they enjoy it not because they want to change the culture. TLDR Embrace new cunts welcome them and allow them to offer themselves freely and without fear.Your mumRegular match threads for the weekly Intrust Super Cup televised game you started doing this towards the end of the season inclusion of international Tests and Grand Finals in the sidebar in the up and coming if a decent stream can be found in advance AMAs from people in league like the Latin Heat AMALinks to relevant content in match threads e.g. match previews team lineups.

You can support a defensively white position without being white. Thats often precisely how racism operates. Similarly I dont really get how you can say racism isnt an issue in Australia nor why youd reduce Tahu to being a sook. I think he was ballsy to call out Johns actions partly because it seemed like this wasnt just a oneoff sledge but years of racist shit going down at the Blues camp. Thats a systemic problem.

Played an amazing setlist sang along to just about every nd song. Crappest view but still a great show nonetheless. . Avenged Sevenfold  Big Top . They were just one of the tightest live bands musically Ive ever seen. Phenomenal.  . Slipknot  Soundwave . I usually just cross my arms and enjoy the music at gigs but these guys got me moving.  guys who know how to put on a frantic but organized show.  . Megadeth  Big Top . You always remember your first. My young self got a blast of how bloody loud live music is.  . Lady Gaga  Allphones . Seeing pop stars at the top of their game is always a ton of fun. A big theatrical show that also showed a great singer she is.  . Taylor Swift  ANZ . Much the same reasons as above it was just such a great entertaining show.  . Alice Cooper  Enmore . A true master of his craft his stage show was sublime and the musicianship was topnotch. He still puts people a third his age to shame.  . Rolling Stones  Adelaide . Mainly for the spectacle. k people inside k people outside just wanting to hear the music. I felt like I was part of something special thatd Id never forget. Theyre still pretty decent given their age too.  . Aerosmith  ANZ . Well after  or so years of playing live music you have to be damn good to still be going strong. A band that hadnt lost a step with age terrific performance.  . Metallica  Soundwave . First time I saw them and Hetfields voice was the best it had sounded in years.Honorable mentions Dragonforce  Kiss  and Motley Crue .,nrl,cxz9vvp,2,t5_2qn90

6333205,0,t3_42dq5e,After it was killed off  years ago plans are afoot to resurrect one of rugby leagues great foundation clubs the Glebe Dirty Reds in time to rejoin the NSWRL fold in .The club which some historians believe was probably the first to join the breakaway professional code in  was voted out of the competition in  after three lean years. There were suggestions at the time that Glebes demise was hastened after Balmain and South Sydney brokered an unholy alliance to get rid of the Dirty Reds to bolster their own territories.In an ironic twist Glebe spokesman Darren Flynn told Fairfax Media that after meeting with the NSWRL last Tuesday the Dirty Reds planned to enter their junior teams into Balmains junior competition.The plan is to have a semiprofessional senior side in either the Ron Massey Cup or the Sydney Shield and depending on the demand locally. Therell be teams run in the Balmain Junior League as well Flynn said. Flynn who produced GBs rugby league coverage in the early s and who has called the NSW Cup said he thought of the idea to revive Glebe six years ago.During the NSW Cup calls I spent a fair bit of time at Henson Park watching Newtown and time at North Sydney Oval watching North Sydney and the work Newtown has done to build their crowds and generate atmosphere is incredible.When I went to my first game there there was probably a few hundred people but on reunion day this year  it is the last game of every year  there would have been  people there. Thats because they provided a matchday experience for families thats affordable. Its played out of a suburban ground at the same time every week  pm on a Saturday.Flynn said he was inspired by the fact Newtown and Glebe had a similar demographic. But he said there also was a great story to share about the Dirty Reds.Some of the greats of the game played for Glebe he said. Frank Burge Chris McKivat the Gray brothers Bert and Frank but unfortunately theyre largely forgotten. I know people are aware of Frank Burge but theyre not all that familiar with the exploits of the players of Glebe and the contribution they made to league in the early days. During its  years in the NSWRL Glebe did not win a premiership but it produced  internationals four of whom  Burge Les Cubitt Arthur Halloway and McKivat  were honoured in the games  centenary celebrations.The NSWRL has been very supportive Flynn said. They made it clear what wed need to demonstrate in order to be considered for one of the semiprofessional competitions and theyve been very helpful in terms of some of our community programs and youth programs. Theyll help us along the way to make that a reality. Basically they couldnt have been more positive and encouraging. They certainly want to see Glebe back because they obviously have a commitment to their foundation clubs. ,nrl,cz9il2b,5,t5_2qn90

Taylor isnt going to learn much alongside a borderlineinexperienced first grade halfback i.e. Mortimer Roberts. Hell probably get more experience playing his natural position halfback against the big boys with Roberts th than hed get trying to learn the ropes at th with RobertsMorts fumbling his way as a halfback.

6390546,0,t3_4373l1,Offtopic but I love this paragraphgtOutrage is there any other state? Right now half the world is outraged at Mitchell Pearce.

Yet another half is so outraged that they have forgotten how to add up. If we were any more outraged at every last thing we would be Virat Kohli.I think sacking Pearce is bullshit not because I think its not deserved but knowing that some club will come along immediately and snap him up. As many others have said the best course of action would be to hit him where it hurts his wallet and his career. Make him cop a massive fucking not just k something significant that hell and other fuckups will remember next time. Make it so he misses a large chunk of footy. ,nrl,czg1ezl,15,t5_2qn90

You get so much more from a player like that than just their onfield performance. The depth of knowledge and the experience they can pass on to the next gen of players in your team is phenomenal.  I mean think about it. If you were an up and coming outside back at Brisbane would you rather be taking your tips amp pointers from Kahu or Inglis?

6552709,0,t1_czwy0t8,Agree with this. Our back row is a little thin in depth. You take Carty or Peach out and the top end quality isnt there. Martin showed he has elite skill but needs at least a season in NSW Cupsome NRL bench time or the odd starting game. Smith is a fullback or centre. ZDC just isnt as good as MartinMoylan and wants to play Hooker. Heffernan is bloody talented utility back not sure what the plan is long term for him and Hiku is a utility back. We have great options but realistically its just Moylan or Wallace this year. DWZ has potential to be a top class fullback as he showed before his lung broke. I dont think we contend this year so might as well try and make the change sooner rather than later. ,nrl,czx3qzj,3,t5_2qn90

The old rule used to be you put the ball on the ground and you and the marker would kind of rake the ball in a one on one scrum kinda situation. Nowadays youre not allowed to play at it as the defender but the attacking team still has to play the ball with your foot to signal the start of the next play.I also think that the rule is that the defenders are allowed to move off the defensive line from the point the ball touches the foot at the play the ball.,nrl,d0lv8rm,2,t5_2qn90

7043694,0,t1_d1eo0h6,IMO  of those times the players legs are in front or at least in line with the body so the initial contact was either forward or flat into the thighleg but refs pretty consistently call knock on if you drop it and its  so the refs call knock on.Clearly in this instance his body and hands were in front of his legs his hands knock the ball into his legs backwards then the ball goes forward.

7044291,0,t1_d1epr8q,Somebody alert the NRL theyve been overlooking the knock on rule consistently in every match thats ever been played!By your interpretation when a fullback almost completely misses but gets a slight knick on the the ball and it bounces off their chest forward its not a knock on.The interpretation clearly is that subsequent not played at ricochets off the body are considered part of the forward movement towards the opposition try line that constitutes a knock on.,nrl,d1ettgq,1,t5_2qn90

7044620,0,t1_d1enq5v,Because its been the long standing interpretation that touching the ball back into your body which knocks it forward unintentionally is a knock on.

7132178,0,t3_4d81c1,New fan here. Have a lot of questions and just making sure I understand most of the rules.   At the beginning of the game Team A kicks off and Team B returns it. When Player B is tackled Team B now has  tackles or does the return tackle count as a tackle? to score a try. Usually on the th tackle Team B elects to punt which is a free for all?.  If a try is scored Team B then gets to kick for an extra  points horizontally in line with where the try was scored but at any distance back. Team B then kicks the ball off to Team A and it repeats.   Is running out of bounds any different from being tackled?  The ball is turned over if you throw the ball behind you and someone on the other team takes it away if you fumble and someone else takes it away or if you commit a penalty.   Speaking of penalties when they show the graphic that says Penalty and the color of the team is that saying penalty against that team or penalty that benefits that team?   And more on penalties. Your options are Play it where the penalty occurred kick a  point goal where the penalty occurred or punt the ball freeforall?   Also who are the biggest stars of the league and who are the most well known for other reasons dirty diva flopper overpaid etc?   When is instant replay used? Only for tries or do fumbles and other things ever get reviewed? Is there the same sense of down by contact that the American football has?   What is the typical scoring range I should expect from a game so beyond what is a high scoring game and under what is a defensive game. For American football I would say between  and  points is about normal?   I dont really understand the scrum. It seems like they go through all this trouble to line up then two seconds later the team that had it just picks up the ball without any trouble.   What is the turnover rate of players on a team? Do stars tend to stay with the same squad or is it more like baseball where they move around a lot?  ,nrl,d1oul1q,15,t5_2qn90

7179856,0,t1_d1u9h59,I mean Dugans stats from last night were pretty incredible. Id chuck him on a wing and have him share a lot of the kick return load with Teddy who is the obvious first pick fullback. Maybe chuck Mansour or another big dog one the other wing to get easy metres out of their half build some momentum.Morris and Roberts in centres because Moz is a beast in defence and no slouch in attack while Roberts is the reverse. He should be playing for the blues eventually why not now.AustinJeynolds partnering Aeynolds in the halves good kicking game  strong running games decent enough defence.Robbie has done good but he may be getting on maybe chuck a dynamic hooker on the bench. Fucked if I know who Peats? Austin or Jeynolds as a utility? Forwards are too boring to pick but I would be tempted to put beau Scott in the team. A numpty in attack but he loves belting Thursto which is how the eels got up over the Cowboys plus his defence is rock solid.Tamou Woods Fafita Klemmer etc etc I dont care.

7192645,0,t1_d1vpbfu,Hoppa has been a no thrills solid fullback this year. Nothing amazing just reliable. I dont think Dugan is down on form his game has been pretty consistent over the seasons. Like uqldrxxxx said Tedesco has more try assists this year than all of Dugans games at fullback for the dragons combined. Only Hoffman has less at fullback for players who have played more than  games in that position since .  His try rate is far from top shelf too.Im not questioning Dugans talent and he is a great fullback if your team can solely rely on your halves to create points much like Hoffman was a solid option while Locky was playing but the dragons and more importantly the blues dont have that luxury. Dugan is a safe option at origin we know what he will deliver and he wont embarrass himself but he wont win the blues any games. That is the problem with blues the last few years all their players have been safe options. With few exceptions you cant point to one player and say they lost the game.  Im sure I could go through each position and have similar arguements between choosing two players but I chose fullback because Teddy has done as much as Ive seen any nsw player do in the last few years to force himself into the team and from all reports Loz is ignoring it. ,nrl,d1vqsoa,2,t5_2qn90

Also you cant trace suspicious activity in an underground market. Fixing in Australian sports could become a major issue. Indian Cricket is a good example of what could happen. The other scenario is large corporate Australian Bookmakers would simply relocate their business overseas and carry on as normal and gamblers can still bet but it just means they will have to use the phone if the internet sites are blocked like they do in Dubai for the horse racing. ,nrl,d1w7ybx,14,t5_2qn90

7420890,0,t1_d2lo9kr,gt Fully erect is unsavoury  using the very real plight of the LGBTIQ community fighting for recognition and to self determine their label is offensive.I think you might be being a little oversensitive here. I dont see a dick joke as the same using the very real plight of the LGBTIQ community as a punchline. Maybe Im wrong maybe Im too blind to it because I am a moderator of a subreddit that is roughly  male. But to me a joke is insensitive or offensive when it uses a person or group of people as a punchline or enforces negative stereotypes of a group of people. A well worn example of this in the world of Rugby League would be equating a soft onfield play with being gay. That clearly enforces a negative stereotype of the gay community. A stereotype which was roundly disproven by former NRL player Ian Roberts in any case. I personally dont see sexual innuendo as offensive in the same way. For example back in the Auckland Nines match threads some other users and myself worked on a Shipper name for RTS and Shaun Johnson. we ended on RTSJ for those interested. To me the humour there isnt that we implied that two men were in a relationship and even if it did it certainly didnt ridicule them for it. The joke came from treating the NRL as if it were a TV show as if the players were characters we hoped would end up together. I admit a lot of the dick jokes and Semi related puns are unfunny but an unfunny dick joke isnt necessarily an antigay joke. By all means if you do see something which you find offensive report it to the mods. We our best to remove racist sexist and homophobic comments but we cant be everywhere and sometimes we miss some. If you disagree and want to try to explain why these things are offensive by all means explain it to us. Take your time theres no rush. Come at this with a cool head. I know it feels like you are being attacked now so take a break come back in an hour or two. ,nrl,d2lpgfr,5,t5_2qn90

7498828,0,t3_4i2xg6,Former Parramatta Eels chief executive Scott Seward approached NRL CEO Todd Greenberg for advice on thirdparty agreements recordings from a Parramatta board meeting in  reveal.Fairfax Media has obtained the transcript provided in the breach notice the NRL handed to Parramatta on Tuesday which mentioned Greenberg however the NRL boss has denied providing any advice that contravened NRL rules in regards to thirdparty payments.The transcript also identifies plans from football manager Daniel Anderson in which he talks about lowering player salaries and replacing them with thirdparty agreements as to clear space in the salary cap.Fairfax Media can also reveal Seward contacted Greenberg last month asking for advice on whether he should agree to be interviewed by the NRL to assist their salary cap investigation into Parramatta.AdvertisementSeward who is a close friend of Greenberg from their time together at the Bulldogs admitted in the December  board meeting to have sought feedback from Greenberg about the way Canterbury handled thirdparty agreements during his tenure as club chief executive.Eels club officials discussed the need to implement thirdparty agreements at the January board meeting with Seward referencing his conversation with the now NRL boss who was listed as Sewards referee when he applied for his job at Parramatta.We do need and what well do is well actually sit down and go through TPAs as a whole Seward said in the meeting.Theres a few different options. Ive spoken to Greenberg about the way that Canterbury and the best options. Ive spoken to Wayne Beavis to tell us how fked we are um and the like.But it is a case of sitting down and working out the best way we can do it. Because right now we are batting this game with one arm tied behind our back. The Roosters have probably got . million in TPA and thats fair thats the game. Thats the way it is.A spokesman for the NRL said any advice Greenberg provided to Seward on thirdparty agreements was in accordance with the rules.There was great conjecture last month when Seward met with the NRL to give his version of events with Parramatta asked to waive a nondisclosure agreement to allow their former CEO to testify against the club.Seward was torn about whether he should tip the bucket on his former colleagues and went to Greenberg for advice.An NRL spokesman confirmed the exchange saying Mr Greenberg advised Mr Seward by text to have an open and honest discussion with the head of the integrity unit Nick Weeks and to provide any evidence he had.The Eels were desperate to save money on their salary cap and devised a plan which was in breach of the NRLs rules to reduce the salary of certain players and replace them with third party agreements.Such a ploy would free space on the salary cap however the NRL picked up on the conversation during their thorough investigation.Yeah we can make the contract variation cause weve got until March  Anderson said in the meeting.So we can find one in February make a contract variation to a players contract take it off their salary give it to them in a TPA and the salary cap value comes down.Read more  Follow us smh on Twitter | sydneymorningherald on Facebook,nrl,d2ukti3,4,t5_2qn90

7522886,0,t1_d2xb5i9,Just google NFL Helmets Causing Concussions and get prepared for the amount of evidence in the past few years it has become A MASSIVE talking point and legal issue regarding the fact that some makers of the helmets even knew the helmets were doing more damage than they were preventing. Mostly it is just the fact that the helmets lead to a false sense of security for players and something like  players experienced a concussion last year in the NFL. You have to remember part of a concussion is the brain essentially flying around the interior of the skull cavity and helmets dont do ANYTHING to prevent that doesnt help that helmets have psychologically in the NFL made their tackling style less concerned with head placement etc. and instead they do things more likely to cause damage because they only think they are safe.Head gear like this  in rugby is not used in the first case for concussion prevention rather it is used to prevent cauliflower ears or at least its original purpose was hence why the original name is a scrum cap and outside of that it helps prevent cuts and abrasions to the head BUT it offers NO concussion prevention. The reason why Rugby League or Union generally experiences a substantially less number of concussions then NFL is because of tackling technique. For one low tackles from an early age you are taught head placement and shoulder placement are paramount along with which direction you pull the player down as to not have them land on your head. Second tackles in Rugby have always had the unspoken rule that they are not meant to HURT the opposition as they are instead meant to prevent forward progression hence why we dont have players dead on the ground after each tackle NFL has a lot more tackles that have the look to hurt players or at least there is an opinion toward that. Third part of the unspoken and written rules of some leaguesunions is that it is the obligation of the tackler to bring the tackled player safely to the ground in tackle so this means landings and so forth often dont have the brutality of a NFL hit because it is illegal to not WRAP the player with your arms and as a result LEGAL tackles have much more control in them. In short when youre not wearing a helmet there is no psychological seed leading you to believe your head is safe and so you protect your head in a tackle and as a result protect the opposing players as well. ,nrl,d2xbcq1,7,t5_2qn90

Grevs wanted to go Maguire said no and is now happy to let him languish in reserves unless absolutely necessary. Its clear Grevsmuhl is down the pecking order now that hes signed with Penrith. So it makes sense that hed want to go. Which makes sense Maguire doesnt want to invest time and effort into a player who wont be there next year. So I can understand why Grevs might feel frustrated  hes simply not a priority. But then why force a player to stay who doesnt want to be there? And given Grevs is basically on minimum wage Souths dont gain any cap advantage in letting him go. Still seems odd to do so now. ,nrl,d2zrfdn,7,t5_2qn90

Photo Getty ImagesA number of our forwards had operations in the preseason so I am seeing them now really start to respond off the back of the training they have been doing Maguire said at Redfern Oval on Tuesday.Tom Burgess unfortunately he had an ankle injury and he is now finding his feet again and George is working through what he needs to so he is starting to come on.Like Tom George missed the start of the season due to injury after having offseason surgery on his hip.Sam Burgess returned to the NRL this year after a season away with English rugby.Maguire said it was hard to judge how Sams round three neck injury had affected his confidence.However the dual international returned to his rampaging best in the win over the Eels and Maguire said he was on the right track.He obviously came back after his World Cup late into the preseason and now he is getting his body back into the great shape that is required to play rugby league Maguire said.Maguire confirmed Greg Inglis will again play fiveeighth for Souths in their round  NRL clash against St George Illawarra on Thursday.Alex Johnston will again play fullback with premiershipwinning pivot Luke Keary coming off the bench.We are going with those same combinations as last week Maguire said.It worked last week and I am looking forward to seeing it again.,nrl,d3a3v6o,5,t5_2qn90

7776242,0,t3_4lth38,when seggy is in form hes amazing. Hes one of my favourite players. If he does leave and join another club he will find his form again no doubt.    I wish he could just play his normal game without worrying about the fancy stuff. His scoring from dummy half forced defensive lines to watch out which gave our backline space. He was part of the reason we went so far in . I hope he can get back into first grade and fight for a contract with us...,nrl,d3q3g4t,9,t5_2qn90
7776557,0,t1_d3q4ohr,That is not a pretty sight. Nice to see Grevsmuhl make his club debut and Leota is a gun. But Latu isnt a lock and Akauola hasnt been setting the world on fire. Backrow depth really being tested here.We need to sort out a longterm . because I dont think Peachey is it for the year. Edit Griffin may well shift Merrin to lock Grevs to nd row and Latu to bench. That looks marginally better. If one of Moylan or Mansour doesnt back up or both for that matter things will look even worse.Saturday is going to be a weird game. Maybe this is a rocket for Segeyaro not a permanent demotion. As much as Im happy for him to walk the team as a whole looks better with Peachey in the centres Wallace in the halves and Yeo in the backrow. ,nrl,d3q4qdv,3,t5_2qn90

Even Latimore with his  minute stints is looking ineffective. gt But unfortunately Soward blocked me on twitterStory time? gt Gus pretty much confirmed we wont be offering segs a contractYeah Segs is gone. I have no issue with that. He was probably my favourite player around . But his fall from grace has been spectacular  and I think a change of scenery will do him a world of good. Its time. Wallace has been a better hooker than Segeyaro. The question is whether  for  at least  the team looks better with or without Segeyaro. Im on the fence given TMM is injured. ,nrl,d44kzoj,2,t5_2qn90

Cover my travel costs and you can pay me when we win.Kenny said the idea came from his wife Suzanne Kenny who is a Central Coast real estate agent with McLachlan Partners.I only get paid when I sell why dont you offer the Blues camp the same deal? Mrs Kenny said to her husband.Kenny says he is simply sick and tired of watching a contest revered for its evenness descend to the lopsided decade NSW has endured.Something has to change and Im happy to jump in and help out Laurie Daley Kenny said.Maybe its time to bring back some of the former NSW winners and impart some old heads on young shoulders to get some winning thinking into the team. We just cant sit back and keep losing.Kenny is extremely frustrated as are thousands of Blues fans and said he just wants to get in there and help the boys get back on top.The yearold regarded as one of the games greatest playmakers knows just about all there is to know about winning rugby league.He won four NRL premierships with his s Parramatta dream team is the only player to score two tries in three grand finals and had two disallowed in another represented NSW and Australia won a challenge cup with Wigan in the UK and is a golden boot winner as the best player in the world.Kenny has had success at coaching rugby league in the past and hopes to have future achievements.,nrl,d4tm8ha,2,t5_2qn90

8685245,0,t1_d6r7cdk,I think theyre right in part. Judgement calls should not be viewed in slow motion. For example theres no set amount of time after which a tackle becomes late or amount of input required for a ball to be stripped. If it comes down to the refs discretion slow motion completely changes the game. I think clearcut black and white issues should be watched in slow motion. If a player is catching it on the inside shoulder or not for instance or if theres a knock on. Slow motion tells you what happened better and if its the kind of call which doesnt need empathy for the game then thats all you can ask for.They are bloody annoying though,nrl,d6ra5nq,3,t5_2qn90

8793440,0,t3_50ksxc,HE NRL Integrity Unit has blocked the first grade debut of Manly youngster Jamil Hopoate declaring he needs to rehabilitate further following a stint in jail before a contract will be registered.Hopoate the son of controversial former Sea Eagles star John and brother of Bulldogs fullback Will had been in line to come into an injury ravaged Manly backline against Penrith on Sunday but the NRL is understood to have scuppered the move earlier this week.The yearold junior star linked again with Manly last month after serving nine months in prison of an month sentence for two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company in .    Father John took to social media on Wednesday evening lamenting the decision and the NRL confirmed its ruling on Thursday.The NRL has required Jamil undertake a range of rehabilitation work before it will consider registering his contract an NRL spokesman told foxsports.com.au.That rehabilitation has not yet been undertaken.    Manly coach Trent Barrett told the press his club had no issue with any ruling from the NRL around its players eligibility on disciplinary grounds with a similar issue also affecting recently signed exRooster Willis Meehan in recent weeks.Jamil hes eligible for NSW Cup but not eligible to play NRL Barrett said.Im not too sure of the details around that. Rules are rules and well abide by them. Well field a strong side on Sunday.The integrity commissions got rules. We stick to them. When our players are all OK to play well play them. If not well abide by the rules and do just that.A promising local junior Jamil Hopoate had his contract with Manly torn up in  after the then Sea Eagles under s player and a group of friends punched and kicked a man rendering him unconscious outside the Ivanhoe Hotel on the northern beaches.    Hopoate had previously rejoined the club after being booted from Parramatta following a drinkdriving conviction and a disciplinary incident at an NRL rookie camp.Having served his time Hopoate has spoken of his stint in jail as a wake up call that helped turn his life around.The damaging backrower began his return to rugby league in May this year and after impressive performances in the local A grade competition forced his way into Manlys NSW Cup side.He scored two tries in last weeks reserve grade loss to Newtown and had been slated to come into Barretts  for NSW Origin star Dylan Walker who continues to struggle with a shoulder injury.Earlier this year Manly and the NRL were involved in a tense standoff over Johns involvement as coach of the clubs SG Ball side.Hopoates career as a junior coach has since been all but canned after he dropped a Supreme Court case appealing an NRL ban imposed after the governing body was advised by a NSW police force detective that he was not a fit and proper person to mentor teens.      Hopoate senior posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening So my son Jamil misses out on debuting for the Eagles this week cause the NRL integrity unit said hes not allowed. Hes done hes sic time so let the play and lets move on ...The head offices stance comes as Cronullas Andrew Fifita faces scrutiny over a police warning for consorting with criminals.Fifita wont be stood down from the Sharks blockbuster minorpremiership showdown with the Storm for what CEO Lyall Gorman says is concern around Fifitas relationship with a longtime friend currently in jail.The Sharks and NSW Origin frontrower is the fourth NRL player to be issued a consorting warning by authorities this season while ongoing investigations into alleged matchfixing and criminal connections within the game continue.,nrl,d74up50,5,t5_2qn90

They wouldnt be involved unless they were confident of this being a serious matter where something will stick  as the CC can question who they like and gaol people for not cooperating.  While this whole thing originated with Manly players  several players at other clubs are implicated  including the Eels  Roosters  Rabbitohs  and Penrith. Draw your own conclusions on who these players might be.  Several players said to be involved have conveniently left the NRL this year through going overseas or through surprisingly sudden retirement. Others are playing their final season.

This combined with Tinkler not paying players the general losing culture and lack of success at the club since Brian Smiths mass exodus of players means it became a very unattractive place for players to want to commit to. With large amounts of salary cap tied up in old andor inadequate players it became hard for the Knights to recruit anyone as they generally had to offer a contract worth more than market value to players and that was money they simply didnt have.

I remember when you had to WAIT to hear when Supply Store was getting a Supreme or Bape drop and people would like up for hours to get what they could if there was even anything left.Supreme opened online shopping...for Europe and Japan but not Australia where they dont even have an official partner store Supply just used to get their connections to sell them whatever they could get their hands on.The resell game was fucked  years ago and its super fucked now. ,nrl,dd7zl2s,3,t5_2qn90

Well the Penrith Panthers are located inthe Wild West of Sydney and his home to the largest and greatest rugby league breeding ground in the world.    Penrith also play an extremely attractive brand of Rugby League. Here is a short taste of what you can expect to see    The Panthers won the comp in  and . So they dont have much prior success which is what makes the team and the area have such a strong connection.    You can even get a Proud Panther membership which is ideal for someone who cant attend games.    Lastly i will list some star players. Matt Moylan Josh Mansour Peter Wallace Nathan Cleary Trent Merrin James Tamou Tyrone Peachey Bryce Cartwright and Waqa Blake. By not naming our best  im actually slightly doggin the boys because they are all great.    Im looking forward to seeing you in a Panthers flair shortly.,nrl,ddkal21,6,t5_2qn90

A second Brisbane team would be easier to build a consistent fan base at home games regardless of unfavourable scheduling.Thats the argument. I dont necessarily agree with it.

No real fullback calling him and other players into position different centers every few weeks. Absolutely horrible for a confidence player. He made a lot of wrong decisions in defence but in those situations the right decision was just about impossible. An intercept or race in and shut a player down before he passed it.

11501129,0,t3_645hsy,If were being realisticThe Tigers would almost certainly have to pay overs for players because besides the premise of being coached by Cleary theres no reason why others want to go and everyone knows theyre sitting on stacks if the big  reject their offers.If Teddy goes you either get a gun fullback very difficult or take your chances on a decent one. Dugan would help build their defence and Clear could help develop his ball playing in a more attack orientated structure.Kahu would have to pay overs to get Waynes goal kicker away from him. Hiku decent and reliable wouldnt be too expensive.Gutherson has proven he can be a very good player but is out of position atm. With the Eels signing Moses an offer for a starting spot at his natural position could be enticingTake a punt on Latrell if Teddy actually does go to the Chooks Hopoate or the Morii if the dogs dont resign them or an even bigger risk with someone like Braidon Burns Connor Watson or Dufty.Halves would be tricky but if Cleary reckons he could get the best out of Brooks then the Tigers shouldnt have to splash their cash too hard on another half.I dont think Foran or Cronk are realistic but if the Tigs get either then well fucking done.Not sold on Jack Bird dont need to replace one arrogant prick at five eight with another Widdop would obviously be best choice but youd have to pay big overs for him to leave the stability he needed. Maybe Townsend or Jeynolds would go alright next to Brooks tooImproving their forwards would be obviousApparently Knights are gonna use that Matt Scott money to try and get JGraham so Tigs should join the raceMatulino is apparently a done deal and hed help. So is McQueen apparently and they paid overs. Would be good signings.
