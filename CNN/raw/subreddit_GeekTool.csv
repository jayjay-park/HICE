2265285,0,t3_2jq627,Same as the other post my disk changed from disks to disk just change it in your .scpt file and save. If it flags it that the file is in use or something like that nature save anyway and it will refresh in a minute. Theres also a CPU UsageMemory UsageDisk usage three bar graph anyone who has that will need to change it there as well.,GeekTool,clrpj73,1,t5_2rfvw

9844243,0,t3_5ga5ia,First thing youre going to want to do is get the wallpaper being used without the information inside the boxes. Then youre going to want to go here and  get the CPU RAM SWAPassuming you use some linux derivative or you can fill it with something else the time uptime weather app and some sort of itunes geeklets.
