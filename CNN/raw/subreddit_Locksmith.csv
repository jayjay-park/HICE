2269682,0,t1_clrvm46,Yes but only someone sophisticated in the topic would be able to weigh the value of the different users contributions right?  Thats important to note and shows the value in going to a bonafide source.Ill share a suggestion despite the fact that many details are needed.  I mean at this level you would want a realistic threat assessment.  You have to know what someone might be after.  Can a single quick breach cause serious harm?  Is there a quick response security detail?  What happens at  minutes?Also are these cylinders on carded doors?  Despite all the comments you might see about D printing keyways and such Id bet a pen team would go after the cards before the keys.So maybe look into MulTLock.  Possible to pick and bump but difficult especially on a random cylinder mounted in a door.  You could always upgrade to Cliq which adds an electronic element to it making picking and bumping irrelevant.  Plus the new MulTLock padlocks have crazy options like GPS tracking and status updates.  It can report when its unlocked or when it leaves a geofence etc.Again though its hard to recommend a component when you dont know what the whole machine is and what its overall purpose is.,Locksmith,cls93ku,0,t5_2r3oj

When they bend they dont travel up and down in their channel when the key goes in. Servicing the lock is usually a matter of new wafers and springs and typically costs .

The kind that are two or four drawer with the keyhole at the top right of the frame not the junky ones from Walmart where it just cam locks both drawers into a little tab.When the medeco lock is pushed in and catches on the back of the sleeves or a hole within the sleeve I dont remember exactly the plunger on the back of the cylinder engages the locking mechanism in the frame of the cabinet. If that is sticking it probably needs to be lubricated or has possibly become bound up if they moved the file cabinet and its sitting crooked or the frame was bent slightly.

11125143,0,t3_5yuk92,Story timeWe had this come up once. Customer had a family member pass away he had locked his house with cheap padlocks and chains and double cylinder MulTLock deadbolts. And the garage door had been disabled.Unfortunately this happened during our on call hours and our on call tech had no idea what he had gotten himself into. After MUCH drilling and spitting and cussing he got them into the front door and they just wanted to put a cheap replacement on in the meantime so he got it done....We thought. Later on when the family had finally got to the door between the kitchen and utility room hoardyhome they found another of these stupid deadbolts. So they called us again. I got to handle this one. The lock was fortunately installed correctly with the screw heads inside the house. They were of course wellhidden from casual observation and a pain to uncover but nothing I couldnt handle.Few turns with an Allen wrench and were in... to just the utility room between the garage and kitchen. On the door to the garage  you guessed it  another of these deadbolts. This one was put in wrong so no screw heads for me. Fortunately I had the other one I had just removed as a guide did some drilling magic and removed redacted and voil the door opens. For about two inches. Thats all the play I had what with the stupid padlocks  of them and chain he had put on the outside of the inner garage door. We eventually got in. Place was creepy as crap. I have seldom been happier to put a house in my rearview.,Locksmith,det0xlh,4,t5_2r3oj

11555186,0,t1_dg56i1f,Sounds like you guys are on the cheaper end of the spectrum nothing wrong with that but it doesnt mean the op overpaid either. For instance my shop charges  for the first half hour and  for each additional half hour from there the lowest end deadbolt we carry is a schlage grade  which we charge  for and  a rekey. We are in a major metro area and we find keeping the price a little higher keeps away most problem customers. ,Locksmith,dg5s8oi,6,t5_2r3oj
11632904,0,t3_65mfy7,Ive got like  years in and two windows. One was like an older Mazda protege where I inserted a wooden wedge to go indoor and the seal had a second lip. It folded over enough to put pressure in the middle of the bottom of the glass to pop it. Second one was like a Lincoln Aviator or something with tempered or was it laminated? glass. Goooood times. ,Locksmith,dgelotl,1,t5_2r3oj

11712436,0,t3_673a4v,I would advise against shoving random objects in your keyhole. Spray some WD inside your lock and all over your key and repeatedly insert and remove the key without trying to turn it.  Just to clarify you need to lube it up and penetrate it at least a dozen times until you think shes ready to turn over.   ,Locksmith,dgnmu58,8,t5_2r3oj
