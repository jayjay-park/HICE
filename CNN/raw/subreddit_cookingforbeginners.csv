1698010,0,t1_cjrh297,Carbonara is always a good quick meal.While your water is heating up chop up some bacon and put it into a cold pan with low heat under it you want it a bit crispy. Grate some parmesan and crack some eggs. Lightly whisk the eggs with a fork and add some cracked black pepper. When the pasta is cooked to your liking strain it and then combine everything in a bowl there should be enough heat in the pastabacon to cook the eggs.Thats the safe way of doing it anyway. I add everything to the pan I cook the bacon in after it has been off the heat for a bit. This saves a bit of washing up but if your pan is too hot it will scramble the eggs.Thats a basic carbonara. I often add mushroom diced chicken anchovy filllets garlic and finish it with cream  not really a carbonara any more.,cookingforbeginners,cjt749m,1,t5_32u9b

Probably under  dollars and you can have as many roll as you need to practice on and eat and you will need practice to not make rolls that fall apart when you cut into it and make consistent rolls. With crab meat you can do Cali rolls spicy crab rolls or mayo crab type rolls. You could probably even do one of those cream cheese fried rolls with crab but thatd be a lot of work. Once you start buying blocks of tuna and salmon is where it starts getting expensive. You likely will have to go to a fish monger in order to request sushi grade fish. Theyll be like  dollars a pound or so. Mackerel and other types of fish can be cheaper but its still fairly expensive. If you want like a giant plate of a variety of nigiri youd be looking to pay  to  which is way cheaper than whatd youd pay at a sushi place for the same plate. ,cookingforbeginners,cjv8l29,2,t5_32u9b

My goto pizza dough recipe is   package dry active yeast   tsp. sugar or other sweetner honey agave whatever you have on hand   cup warm water  Tbsp olive oil  more for bowl   tsp. salt  cups flour  more for kneading. Cornmeal for oven. Mix the yeast sugar and warm water together in mixing bowl. Let stand  minutes letting yeast activate.. Add salt olive oil and  c. flour. Add the rest slowly as you begin to knead. If you are hand kneading flour your surface thoroughly and turn your dough out then knead. If youre using a dough hook make sure not to overwork the dough. . Drizzle olive oil lightly into a clean bowl. Set dough ball in new bowl then turn it over so olive oil lightly coats both sides. Cover bowl with wet towel and leave for at least  hour.. After dough has doubled in side gently punch it down to deflate and let rest  minutes as you begin to prepare your toppings.. If youre baking on a cookie sheet sprinkle cornmeal to cover then shape your dough into your pizza shape and add toppings.Some people will swear by overnight dough and say that sameday dough cant compare but this recipe is good for when say you decide one afternoon that you want pizza that night.Veggie chilli is one of my favorite meals ever. I use onions mushrooms garlic bell pepper crushed tomato black beans pinto beans chilli powder and massive amounts of cumin. Serve with avocado salsa chips and cheese. If you have leftovers let them simmer down and make tacos.Curries are great. Theres a huge variety. If you have coconut milk you can make Thai yellow curry. Heres a recipe I used loosely last night using soy sauce instead of Tamari and apple cider vinegar because I was out of rice vinegar. Curries are good because you can work with almost any vegetable you have on hand. If youre making Indian food you can serve with roti naan or rice.

6024767,0,t3_3w5u1b,I did what you are doing now got a bit of confidence and taught myself a few more complex dishes and whilst it was great I always felt like there was something missing. Ive only recently realised what Im missing is a range of sauces.I was at my parents for a few days my dad is a great cook and he basically cooked the same  vegetables three nights in a row from the garden so an over abundance was bbeing worked through and despite that we had three very different meals I realised then hed constructed all of it round a different sauce. It sounds like youve got a tomato sauce in the bag maybe try to get your head round a simple white sauce. Its a base for absolutely loads of other things plus knowing how to make and use a roux is handy White sauce is  things flour butter and milk. The ratio is  part flour  part butter  parts milk. for example g flourg butterml milk i know Im mixing my measurements but bare with meThe important part is the roux. Its a  ratio of flour and fat they combine together and act as a thickening agent when they get hot basically the flour releases its starch and it combines with the fats to get thick.Roux is simple in theory but can take a bit of practice and getting it wrong causes horrible lumps of floury guck in your sauce. melt the butter at a really low temperature if it bubbles you lose some of the thickening effect seive your flour add the flour to your melted butter really slowly and then mix it in really well before adding the next bit once mixed raise the temperature a bit to cook the flour and properly integrate it with the butter. Dont get it hotOnce its done it should be consistently smooth. The taste is literally floury butter dont worry that gets lost when you mix it.To make it a white sauce you then add your milk. Again a small amount at a time and whisking like mad to keep it smooth again dont let it get too hot to begin with there are arguments about warming the milk first but I dont these days and it seems ok.Once youve added your milk thats it white sauce aka Bechamel sauce one of the five mother sauces in French cuisine and used as a base for loads of stuff. Try your hand at puff pastry too and use the white sauce for a chicken and mushroom pie.Sorry got carried away there!

8742891,0,t1_d6werck,Read the entire recipe before you start. This is key for recipes youve never made before. I have cooked in many professional kitchens where the recipe calls for something like  oz of butter. Then one of the first steps in the recipe is sautee onions in butter. So I throw all  oz of butter in with some onions later to find that  oz of that butter should have been used to make a roux in a separate  pot. Granted I could still make the roux in the same pot with the onions but if I had followed the recipe so far to cook the onions until translucent and the recipe calls for a brown roux then Im going to have a tough time getting a brown roux without burning the onions  all because I didnt read ahead in the recipe. Not all is lost though. You can still turn down the heat and stir constantly to keep from burning the onions but my point is it will take a lot more of your time and attention than simply making a brown roux in a separate pan. And this is just a very basic and easily fixable example to illustrate a point.  But use this example to imagine accidentally adding oz of balsamic vinegar for example to something where you only should have added  oz at that step. Balsmic vinegar is pretty strong  that mistake is really going to fuck up any recipe that doesnt feature balsamic vinegar. Also on a different note have mise en place. Thats more or less a fancy french phrase for having all your shit together before you start. Recipe calls for  cup of diced onions? Have  cup of diced onions cut before you even start. Have  tsp of pepper measured out before you start. Etc. The more experienced you get the less mise en place you need. But even with experience when cooking a new recipe go all out and be  prepared. ,cookingforbeginners,d6yiito,1,t5_32u9b

9002330,0,t1_d7twkpf,Yeah apparently! I think most people dont change their sponge that often... I replace mine about once a month but I have two roommates so the sponge gets a lot of use. It looks like you can use the same sponge for a lot longer if you disinfect it in the microwave or in the dishwasher. If your sponge ever starts to smell though throw it out immediately!,cookingforbeginners,d7txv7q,4,t5_32u9b

10493011,0,t3_5q8r47,What do you do with ingredients? For instance you want to cook a meal from a cookbook but it requires a bunch of ingredients. So you buy them. And you cook one meal. Now you got a bunch of ingredients that you may not use again. To me this just seems silly. Am I to use the same recipe every time to exhaust those ingredients?

10497480,0,t1_dcxpauv,This is great advice. The only subtle correction I would make is to salt and pepper them properly. Vegetables dont contain much natural sodium so salt them for volume with kosher salt and this will bring out the natural flavor of the vegetables more than you can believe.If youre feeling really crazy mix your oil with some melted butter when you coat your vegetables. This will give you a beautiful texture when you eat them.,cookingforbeginners,dcy009q,2,t5_32u9b

That should still taste yummy with some rice and chutney! Good luck.,cookingforbeginners,dgr3mm6,2,t5_32u9b
