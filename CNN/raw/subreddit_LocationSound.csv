116573,0,t1_cerojwe,I think automated waveform syncing like Plural Eyes will become the standard.  I know Plural Eyes has problems but already that kind of technology is being incorporated directly into NLEs.  Running a single wireless audio channel into each camera and then syncing them to the recorded audio is really quite efficient and inexpensive plus it completely eliminates timecode from the equation.  If the waveforms are the same the sync WILL work  and if you think about it thats essentially how timecode works anyway.  The only thing standing between us and this workflow is tradition and lack of knowledge in the part of producers.  ,LocationSound,cerpemc,4,t5_2tig0

5857481,0,t1_cxnf2lh,After  months of fine business a problem with the gain controls has developedThere are  input gain knobs on the front one for each channel. On channels  and  turning the knob only intermittently results in actually changing the gain. Turn it all the way up and the channel remains at the same gain that it was set at  UNTIL a large signal is present at the input like a finger snap etc then the input gain snaps to the value it should be at the current knob setting.Very odd.Today I updated to the newest version of firmware and the problem changed a bit. Now turning the gain knob usually updates the gain in realtime but its accompanied by a nice click as the input amplifier chip steps through its digital gain settings. Again channel  and  have problems  and  work fine. AND channel  clicks and pops and distorts when the knob is close to max.If I had to guess at the diagnosis there is something wrong with the sending of gain steps from the gain potencoder to the input amplifier or a problem with the how that amp chip translates that to analog gain.Also after I updated the firmware it burned through a set of AAs in about  minutes... not sure if its related. Its a battery hog but never that much.But Im not sure.

It really depends on how your relationship with the producers are on the show as it stands. Usually an error like this would have been caught immediately at lunch or at the end of Day  after an offload. The DMT should have caught this immediately after the transfer and screenshotted the completed file size comparison but being lowbudget Im sure the DMT didnt have any sort of protocols in place.On a big show you would have been let go after Day . Possibly after Day  if they couldnt have found someone quickly enough. My point is you would have been paid for those two days and not asked to come in for a freebie pickup day.There are a few factors you can look at.  Have you been paid already for the first three days?  What is your relationship with the Producers? Are they from out of town? Are they wellconnected? How was your experience on set? Were you treated fairly? Are you willing to make up for the mistakes that occurred?If youve been paid and willing to take some risk you could easily tell them to fuck off and run or you could do the freebie pickup day and show some goodwill.

In terms of location dialogue recording the downside is that its only a  track recorder. This really limits you if you are using a lot of lavs. If you are using no more than  mics you should be fine. Other downside is that it doesnt have good mixing knobs. Youd need a separate mixer if you were anticipating a lot a mixing while recording.
