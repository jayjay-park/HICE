285526,0,t1_cfa5nfn,gtgt Different traditions define enlightenment differentlygt Would you agree that the different definitions have one thing in common enlightenment is the integration of the insight that any mentalemotionalsensory construct of self that can be identified with is by definition not the self itself but a symbolic representation of it therefore the identification is illusory?Nope.Its not insight at least with TM but a fundamental difference in how the brain is functioning and how one ends up describing the situation.It is perfectly possible by TM theory for someone to attain the preliminary stage of enlightenment without any practice of any type at all. It is merely what a healthy lowstress adult human should mature into in sufficiently healthy circumstances assuming a nice set of genes epigenetic heritage from your parents etc.gt Edit Id like to add that identification with anything other than the whole is a division of the qualia in me and notme identification and antiidentification. Total absence of identification noselfsunyata in Buddhism or identification with the whole Selfatman in Hinduism comes down to the same thing experiencing oneness.But experiencing oneness means different things to different people. The physiological correlates of how this arises during TM might be entirely different than how it arises during some other practice and the litmus test according to the TM tradition isnt just some experience but the ability to get the rest of your self to go along with your intent. E.G. the ability to perform some arbitrary siddhi in some arbitrary context.Even before some total permanent state arises one should at least show signs of floating during the TMSidhis technique called Yogic Flying.Without that experiencing oneness is merely some philosophical construct even if  the perception is due to some fundamental shift in how the nervous system is dealing with perception. If the universe doesnt go along with your intent you cant claim oneness with the universe.Note that by that criteria no TMer has ever attained full enlightenment or even shown real  signs of it.,cogsci,cfacxl1,1,t5_2qh0k

Frankly I dont think its at all justified to chalk this up to some pseudoexplanation that touch and smell are more primitive and less nuanced.  It seems much more likely that the reason people arent as good as imagining smell and touch is simply that they dont have to do it as often and are therefore less experienced with it.  Similarly smell plays a much smaller role in our day to day existence than does hearing and sight so why wouldnt it correspondingly be less prominent in dreams?  If you go ask people working in an industry like perfume wine chemical scents and flavoring  someone who spends a substantial amount of mental energy on smell and taste  I bet theyd report a rather enhanced level of ability in imagining smells and also probably have larger roles for smells in their dreams.  ,cogsci,ckheoyb,3,t5_2qh0k

6127339,0,t1_cym0mz8,gtThe claim that cannot be backed up yet is that experience can be explained by any of the known physical laws.You speak as though these laws explain everything. Elasticity for instance is an emergent phenomena. When the laws of classical thermodynamics was derived they were thought to be fundamental. Then we managed to derive it from statistical mechanics. At which point classical thermodynamics was thought to be equivalent. Then Einstein published his paper on Brownian motion. Classical thermodynamics are emergent laws not properties fundamentally contained in the individual elements. You mention gravity but are you aware of the equivalence between gravity and thermodynamics?The Einstein equations for generalized theories of gravity and the thermodynamic relation Q  T S are equivalentYou mention electrons and electromagnetic forces. Are you aware that the Schrodinger equation has been derived from an exact uncertainty principle?Schrodinger equation from an exact uncertainty principleIn this sense you could argue these fundamental laws are not fundamental at all. Even the usual notion of a particle is thought of more as a property of a field rather that a particle as usually conceived. The distinction between matter and energy is merely one of configuration.So if these phenomena that your basing your notion of what explains the world are emergent rather than fundamental things in themselves why would consciousness be any different? gtThe existence of Learning and intelligent patterning do not indicate that they are being experienced. As much as we know every component of the physical world is a Philosophicalzombie What is the common feature of every paradox is every field of study including philosophy? It would be selfreference in one form or the other. You are looking into yourself drawing a conclusion and then referencing back to yourself to justify that conclusion. Fundamentally its the logical equivalent of saying the Bible is true and to prove it the Bible says so. If you had an actual philosophical zombie how would you convince it that thats what it was? What would it take for the zombie to convince you it was actually experiencing the world? gtIt is a very fine distinction that not many understand.I do understand how confounding it is conceptually. Thats why I invoked a liquid state machine to show how these effects can be defined by you. You define the state that is reverberating through you and then refer back to yourself as proof that it is different than any physical law you know. I also know how easy it is to create false memories in people which they then experience with the same level of certainty. The manner in which this sensory information is compressed and represented as qualia in color sound etc. makes all sorts of illusions trivially easy to produce. But producing the qualia makes is so much easier to to compress highly complex sensory information into categories that can be quickly and easily sorted through. Its no different from loads of other emergent phenomena only with a far higher capacity to sort classical data. Though neural nets cant solve the N !

6373719,0,t1_cze212q,I think about this a alot. In the western world at least people are not viewed by societal structures as a person first with individual needs wants desires etc. We are viewed first as consumers and workers. Even Karl Marx for all his genius still viewed a person as a cog in the machine of civilization a worker. I do not think that work is the primary motivation for the human. I think instead thatthe desire for happiness satisfaction and equilibrium are literally ingrained in our DNA. Work is a function of keeping society moving forward. Growth the politicians and business people like to call it. Before the agricultural revolution humans were just another part of the Earth like every other form of life. They lived in harmony with their surroundings foraged for food when necessary fucked and hung out. Once large scale farming took over the population exploded which precipitated a need for the person to stop lounging foraging hanging and fucking so they could work the fields in order to take care of their ever growing population. Do you think they liked not napping under waterfalls to break their backs digging up dirt?Now I dont want to oversimplify here. In todays world of  billion not sure if that is right nowadays we cant forage and hang and have everyone live. If the wheels of civilization are to keep turning then most of us must participate in order to keep the food growing the medicine synthesized and the Internet bleeping. However my point here was about biology not sociology. This societal structure that necessitates work is only a couple thousand years old. There has not been enough time for evolution to catch up. Therefore if we are not literally hardwired for a reward structure that releases dopamine when a task like work is accomplished then in makes sense that a sense of lostness alienation and despair would set in eventually because we are not doing what we are literally hardwired to do lounging foraging hanging and fucking. Especially if a person becomes so accustomed to the lack of dopamine that they lost the ability to make it.Personally I am enough of a futurist to be able to foresee a day when work will be automated and people will not have to work creating that sense of alienation and artificialness. However that will create its own set of problems a la WallE. I think depression along with a myriad of other sickness especially mental are the result of humans not doing what humans are literally meant to do. However since we have got to keep the civilization machine moving forward despite the needs of the individual we synthesize quick fixes like medicines to treat a symptom instead of dealing with the holistic biological needs of the individual like curing a disease. Why? Gotta keep the machine going. ,cogsci,cze4e8z,11,t5_2qh0k

But something that probably shouldve been placed at the top of the articlegtScientists who spend their days mulling over EEG wave forms and complex digital patterns in magnetic resonance imaging realize that they cannot yet offer definitive neurosciencebased prescriptions for improving learning. The work however is leading to a vision of what is possible perhaps for Generation Z or its progeny.It was a bit spooked early about the rush for baby mobiles that teach babies things. I get the point but I really dont want our education system to turn into thisBut some things stood outgt During the past  years experts have warmed to the idea of executive function as a teachable skill. An educational curriculum called Tools of the Mind has had success in some lowincome school districts where children typically do not fare as well academically compared with highincome districts. The program trains children to resist temptations and distractions and to practice tasks designed toenhance working memory and flexible thinking. In one example of a selfregulation task a child might tell himself aloud what to do. These techniques are potentially so powerful that in centers of higher learning economists now contemplate public policy measures to improve selfcontrol as a way to enhance the physical and financial health of the population and reduce the rate of crime remark the authors of a study that appeared in the February Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.As a musician the whole section on music was also interesting like Ive heard its beneficial before but seeing some evidence of it was helpful.

7651845,0,t1_d3bkl9p,To the contrary the probabilistic nature of the quantum world would make the task of simulating ourselves even more complex. If we could get away with just simulating a lot of definite point wed have easy sailing ahead of us. The computer hardware that we currently have is optimized to do exactly that.The real problem occurs when you consider that instead of simulating every point at every time we have to simulate a set number of probabilities for every point at all times then simulate how those probabilities affect one another they interact in a very nontrivial way and if that wasnt enough you have to actually use those probabilities to generate a set of definite values which could then be fed into the rest of the simulations. This would have to be done for each step in the simulation which would probably need a time resolution on the order of nanoseconds. To actually do this effectively we would not only need another few decades of Moores law but also some quantum computers to offload the probability calculations onto.However that still misses the main problem. We would also need to measure all those initial parameters for the entire system we are trying to simulate at a single instant. Thats the real challenge. ,cogsci,d3bz0gz,1,t5_2qh0k

7827953,0,t1_d3vwop3,Well given that I dont know which three neurotransmitters are your favorites and there are a whole lot of combinations you could be looking for Ill just give an honest answer about the industry w.r.t. neuro research. After the proliferation and popularization of antidepressants in the late s and s followed by the backlash and addition of blackbox warnings in the s a lot of neuro programs in pharma shuttered. Basically the lack of new treatments for brain disorders was a consequence of us a finding treatments and not understanding them b trying to understand them and going holy shit this is a mess c the public and the FDA pushing back against overmedication with those that were discovered and d market forces i.e. enough were on the market to not guarantee a firstinclass or bestinclass drug after a development program and clinical trial so it was no longer worth paying for clinicals if were not going to get good ROI. That being said about three and a half years ago Novartis rebooted their neuro program and I believe since then Pfizer has also amped up their neuro work. The public buzz about mental health I think has helped this immensely. From a practical standpoint many neurotransmitters are very structurally similar and their receptors have evolved to be exquisitely selective for their natural substrates. Ligands that are able to bind multiple receptors are responsible for the sort of offtarget effects you see in older antipsychotics. i.e. when we design molecules we typically try to design selectively usually. This gets back to there being really several different ways someone can attempt to build a drug. What youre talking about with hitting multiple targets at once is one facet of the polypharmacological drug design. The intent is to design molecules that hit multiple targets in a given pathway weakly rather than to hit one nail with a very big hammer. Its a cool method and the network maths behind it are super super interesting but its also something thats hard to do intentionally while still avoiding off targets that you dont want. So if I make a promiscuous ligand it has to be promiscuous enough to hit all the receptors I want but not so promiscuous that it hits other things as well mucking about with stuff I didnt want it to. So long story short you cant buy a triple reuptake inhibitor because science is hard drug design costs money and brains are complicated. ,cogsci,d3vxfvg,1,t5_2qh0k

To presume that at least very generally these mechanisms which generally support the growth explanation over preexisting connections span too many levels of empirical data to seriously question except in details.Furthermore in the taxi studies alone the correlation increases with experience. From the abstractgt Furthermore years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers with right posterior gray matter volume increasing and anterior volume decreasing with more navigation experience.The idea that preexisting skills predict the longevity of careers is also hard to maintain. Also from the abstractgtWe then tested for functional differences between the groups and found that the ability to acquire new visuospatial information was worse in taxi drivers than in bus drivers.So this indicates that these years of experience also correlates with less preexisting skill at learning routes. But again the pruning feature likely has a lot to do with this. Since after learning these routes connection types associated with learning routes are likely to fall into disuse and atrophy. Even as the connection types associated with maintaining learned routes expand. This is anecdotally consistent with the first quote. In which the anterior volume decreased as the posterior volume increased with experience. A process that correlates with a worsened ability to learn new routes.We have a lot to learn and jumping to SciFi level generalizations about the meaning of better are indeed absurd. But I would argue that hand waving a preexisting skill argument white washes too many levels of qualitative and quantitative empirical data to be tenable. Even the general features of HebbianantiHebbian learning implies growthpruning respectively. ,cogsci,de3p1vo,2,t5_2qh0k
11306240,0,t1_dfdic5b,Thats OK. If Im successful Ill have plenty of more interesting things to do than gloat over the many hundreds or thousands of people who have told me that Im wrong ,cogsci,dfdjn4d,1,t5_2qh0k
