41777,0,t1_cej6dmd,Haha nope. Goes by that silly ol statement that every kid is different. Some kids just dont wake at night to eat others do but I dont think solids are the full proof way to get them to STTN or longer stretches as an infant. Eating has never impacted my sons sleep until recently now at  months. Im pregnant and my milk is dwindling. Last night my son skipped dinner because he had a late snack. He nursed to sleep at p but there wasnt as much as hes used to. He woke up at midnight nursed but found it wasnt enough. He asked for a banana. Never have I had to feed my kid a snack in addition to milk but I have noticed he does wake more now if he didnt eat well during the day. ,breastfeeding,cej6r3k,1,t5_2rdj4

Whens her birthday?Third I dont know where youre at on the solids spectrum but at this point I give my little one some of everything I eat.  In the morning I make her a softboiled egg and give her some of my oatmeal lunch is usually about  cup of food total from everything on my plate sometimes Ill give her her own fruit to chew on if my plate doesnt have a ton of veg on it and dinner is always about the same.  If the food is too spicy or whatever Ill make her a peanut butter and banana sandwich.  Shes pretty into it.  Also I cook with coconut and olive oils a lot so I think she gets quite a bit of those.  I put coconut oil in my oatmeal and it a tastes delicious and b adds that extra fat oomph.  I do the same with pancakes and most breakfast foods.  We also make green smoothies in the morning most of the time and well throw an avocado in for fats.  The kid LOVES avocado.  Sometimes Ill give her some of the smoothie or Ill just slice up some avocado separately for her and let her go to town.  Thats another awesome way to get some fat into her diet.  I also feel it necessary to add that we cosleep Im breastfeeding on demand and shes still up  times a night.  In general she sleeps through but when shes growingteethinglearning she stirs much more often and we all get more sleeping done if I nurse her at night.  My understanding is that its pretty normal for babies to wakenurse that often until theyre past  months even though theyre technically capable of sleeping through the night.Good luck!

Of course Im a numbers person so I like to know all the details...   ounces sounds about right if you are gone for  hours and baby also eats at night. Ive read on kellymom babies should be getting around  ounces total per day so that sounds proportional though I would be curious to ask hubby if that is actually what hes taking.You said elsewhere you get roughly  ounces when you pump if youre pumping twice a day and hes taking  ounces while youre away youre at most  oz. short per day so its really not that much supplementation.

Also my babys  months old and I still dont know how to hand express. I would suggest watching a youtube video about how to get the baby latched properly. Sorry I dont have a link. Also find out if your hospital has lactation consultants available. At the hospital where I gave birth they have the lactation consultant visit every breastfeeding mother without having to ask. You may need to ask to see one and they can be very helpful if you have issues. I also refused to buy a can of formula as backup. That attitude is important. When youre overwhelmed and sleepdeprived and someones telling you the baby needs formula for some madeup reason that conviction will help you do what you know is right.

290140,0,t3_1xeuiw,Breastmilk color can vary for many reasons. It can change due to what one ate or just be different mom to mom. Mine was sometimes more blue and other times more yellow. Sometimes it was more watery and others it had a nice thick layer of fat. Your milk could be less fatty if you dont have the right things in your diet. Do you have healthy fats like avocado and olive oil? These are good for you and baby too! Now isnt the time to diet. Make sure you are feeding yourself right. Get enough calories healthy foods esp those fats and plenty of water. I saw a lack of weight gain when I started cutting back on the fats from my diet to lose weight around  months PP. I immediately went back to higher fat and that helped. You could have a forehind milk imbalance. The hind milk is where most of the fat is. If baby is getting too much of the foremilk before they finally are able to fill up on hind milk that can be cause for lack of weight gain. I think its usually associated with oversupply but I dont think that its the only way to have a foremilkhindmilk imbalance. Heres what kellymom has to say about it ,breastfeeding,cfau5tj,4,t5_2rdj4

413177,0,t3_1yshv0,For me breast milk consistency was about the same at  year as it was at  months.According to my pediatrician the amount of breast milk your daughter will eat more or less levels out at  months and she will get the extra calories that she needs from solids.  At  months she doesnt need lots of extra calories and is just getting used to eating not milk.  As she gets older shell eat more.  I assume that since milk production is a supply and demand game that if she eats less solids your body will make more milk and if she eats more solids your body will make less.  Id ignore the people who tell you what to do in regards to breastfeeding.  Either you and your daughter both want to breastfeed or you dont.

441612,1,t3_1z40l5,Here is my Facebook response to the articleBOOB FACT SPECIAL DEBUNKING EDITION!! A few people have asked me about this research which claims that sibling studies demonstrate that the benefits of breastfeeding are overstated millions of babies dead from NEC disagree but I digress. Lets get the easy stuff out of the way yes  its a bad study. Lets ignore that Ohio State has a good long history with their neighbors Abbott Nutrition makers of Similac. There is no new data here this conclusion is based off of data collected from a larger national survey that asked mothers if they breastfed their children. The researcher compared health outcomes of siblings who were breastfed AT ALL to those who were not. So that means one latch in the hospital goes into the breastfed pile. For families who have siblings who were differently fed the odds of one child being exclusively breast fed for at least six months and another not at all are slim. But even more fundamentally the research is flawed from the start because there are NO benefits of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is the baseline of the physiological norm against which all others should be measured. Breastfeeding has nothing to prove. The health status derived from breastfeeding is the normal physiological expectation of health. Its not an extra or a boost.,breastfeeding,cfqjddy,2,t5_2rdj4

That way you can get started early and not put too much pressure on yourself in terms of stocking up your stash. In terms of timing I started out pumping once a day after the first morning feed and that would usually generate  oz extra that I could store.

923240,0,t3_24otkv,If youre concerned and your pediatrician is conveniently close talk to your pediatricians office about weekly weight checks for the next few weeks. I wouldnt recommend checks any more frequent  we had serious weight gain issues in the beginning took us a whole month to get back to birth weight and at one point he stayed the same weight for  days.  days later he was up  oz and  days after that he was up another . Its like when you weight yourself  yes he should be gaining at least . ozday but youll make yourself nuts watching the scale.The things my pediatrician told me to watch for were diaper counts activity level and his cry. Essentially if he slowed down his wet diaper count became obviously fatigued trouble waking him up to feed shorter or no walkful periods less neck control or if his cry got really quiet then we should supplement Im an hour from the doctor so unscheduled weight checks arent convenient for us. Meanwhile have some faith your body can take care of him. If you have no other evidence he isnt being well fed and some babies are just skinny  my LO will likely never be a chubster but he is bright eyed and healthy even though I have felt his back bone since day  take a deep breath and relax. It sounds like youre doing really really well!Also I pump some throughout the day still to give myself a bumper when I go back to work and some days I get oz some days I get  spread over  sessions an hour after nursing. Some days are just more productive than others. If he needs more he will feed for longer to get more.

1547944,0,t1_cjaa7xa,Listen Im not trying to start a debate here but yes it is illegal to moo at your friend while shes on her way to pump AT WORK theres some fine print about the size of your workplace ie it might not be illegal if less than  people are employed by your employer but for the purpose of this argument Ill assume your employer is comprised of  people.  Here is whyIf like in the original example your workplace set up a pumping roomarea for lactating women and you elect to moo at your friend one time or each time she walks down the hall to go to that area so she can pump anyone and everyone that hears you moo at said friend ALSO experiences hearing you moo at your friend while shes on her way to pump breastmilk.  Your inside joke culture becomes the workplace culture surrounding lactating women.  Even if you quietly whisper the word moo to her while shes passing you in the hallway if a coworker heard you whispering moo its still discriminatory speech because it can be interpreted as derogatory to all women who are lactating.  You see how I dont think its funny AT ALL to moo at lactating women?  If I see that behavior occurring around me it makes me uncomfortable and I assume its the accepted culture in the place Im in.  Its the exact same as if two of my coworkers call each other slut or bitch and no one tells them to stop.  In a professional environment that kind of behavior can EASILY get a supervisor in trouble with HR if another employee complains about being uncomfortable.  ,breastfeeding,cjab3ye,1,t5_2rdj4

1735386,0,t3_2ebaix,Totally normal!! Whats happening at night is called Cluster feedings. Its a PIA but totally normal. Itll get better over time!  You will start to learn what your LO likes best and itll work for you.  I also have a bag of tricks for my son when he gets into the fussy mode when I know hes not hungry and I try various of things. Not one thing ALWAYS work.  When she naps on you let her.  To me its not worth trying to get her trained to sleep in the cribplaypen just yet.  She may be just a velcro baby like mine and eventually will start to do better on her own.  After a few months my son can finally sleep in the playpen longer than an hour!   The Skin to skin sleeping on you actually helps YOU produce more milk AND help your daughter regulate her heartrate heat and reduce SIDS. So theres a bonus! For the first month or two Ive gotten used to the lack of sleep due to trying to get my son to eat soothe sleep.  My suggestion is to put a couch and a playpen in the same room.  Side nurseco sleep.   To me it worked wonders until he started to get a little more active and I was able to transfer him to sleeping in Playpen. YOU are your daughters mom. YOU make the decisions. Colic  if shes screamingcrying for  hours straight WITHOUT breaks and unconsolable for  days for  weeks...thats colic.   So I think shes just going through cluster feeds.  Just deal with it and itll get better over time. I personally dont believe in sleep training until maybe  months.  You can somewhat start by turning off the lights at pm and let her do her normal routine. Thats what I do...he sleeps in the den. At pm its lights off TV turned down very low and no activities to stimulate him and its mainly holding him nursing comforting etc etc.  Over time it got easier.   During the wonder weeks is when it get hard just know itll be over soon...and laugh. Dheres another trick that I learned recently  bring stroller inside the house with the car seat. Push stroller around a room that you can...like a dining room around the table..around and around and around. My son fell asleep after  minutes of pushing. I left him in the car seat for  hour and I easily moved him to playpen swaddle makes it super easy. Dont need to buckle...dont get mad at me Moms its easier!. He slept for . hours. So yeah. DBest of luck! PS  Babies do not get constipated when breastfed.  If she is acting like shes straining shes learning how to use her sphincters so she doesnt quite get it yet. She will!  if shes pulling up her leg and cries in pain it sounds differently to me and happens every time...she has bad gas. Gas drops gripe water will help but I personally found Gerber Colic Soothe to work the best. After my son was on that BOOM gas pains went away.  He still farts but its not painful.

One of the things I found when trying to google my way to an answer was to not try and press the breast away from babies nose as you can end up compressing a duct and causing a blockage and if youre getting it in the same place everytime it seems reasonable that that may cause it. Easier said than done when they are smushed into your boob I know but Ive been working on different positions that allow his head to tip way back so his nose is free. Or if I messed that up and hes already latched then I try and kind of keep one nostril free then move my hand to free the other after a couple if minutes in the hope that Im not compressing the same area for too long.

2105419,0,t3_2j0wvd,He may just be getting fuller from food rather than breast milk. If you express the milk your body will continue to make it. Supply in demand. If you stop pumping your body will start making only the amount your baby wants. It will take a few days and you will feel engorged but it will go down. If you need to release some pressure only pump a little enough to make you feel more comfortable. You should actually feed your baby from one side all the time. That way they get the hind milk. You can wear a bracelet to remind you of the side or do as I do and just feel what boob is more full and feed on that side.  You wont be more more at risk for mastitis than any other time. Your body will work its self out. Credentials mother of   breast feed all babies for a totally of  months and still going. ,breastfeeding,cl7g0p0,1,t5_2rdj4

2172638,0,t1_clfyyvh,From The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding  There isnt a lot of iron in your milk but there isnt supposed to be. Its much more completely absorbed by your baby than the kind in formula baby cereal or iron supplements. If your breastfed baby gets too much iron it will end up feeding the wrong bacteria in his intestines. Your amazing milk contains a protein called lactoferrin that binds to extra iron that your baby doesnt use keeping it from feeding harmful intestinal bacteria. Iron supplements  can overwhelm the lactoferrin so that the bacteria thrive often resulting in diarrhea and even microscopic bleeding.andAfter generations of formulafeeding you can see why doctors with little experience in breastfeeding may recommend unnecessary vitamin or mineral supplements for their breastfed patients.There are a few exceptions   If your babys cord was cut before it stopped pusling he missed out on up to a third of his intended blood supply. Thats a lot of iron to lose. He should be fine for the first half year and will probably be fine from then on as well but when he starts solids look for ironrich foods such as meats dark green leafy vegetables and beets much better than the type of iron in baby cereal If your baby is started on solids prematurely  before he would start eating them on his own  his iron stores may drop. Some fruits and vegetables can bind with the iron in your milk before baby has a chance to absorb it. If your baby was born prematurely he may not have been born with the same nutrient stores as a fullterm baby and the same guidelines may not apply.  I just read that yesterday! I thought it was interesting and relevant. I was previously unaware of those exceptions.  And we just handed my son strips of steak to chomp on as one of his first foods. He loved it.,breastfeeding,clfzspn,6,t5_2rdj4

2607018,0,t3_2ppm27,Heres a gentler method you might want to consider.  Time the first feed of the night then each night cut it back by a minute or so until its gone.  Then work on the next feed.  The idea is that from about  months babies dont need to feed at night but their metabolism is used to feeding and it can wake them up.  So if you gently reduce the feed then their metabolism will stop expecting it at that time.  If you have a partner then it can help to pass the baby to them once youve finished feeding  its a no more milk but have a wee cuddle signal.  I have just night weaned my  month old using this method and I used it to cut down on the number of night feeds several times.

Also born earlysmall it was hard at first but he still nurses at bedtime through the night if he wakes and in the morning and I love it. Also when he doesnt feel good or is upset I still nurse. He is still very comforted by nursing and as long as hes getting enough daily calories from formula I can nurse him as much as I want on top of that.

Its a very important and rewarding bond that youll appreciate having in the future. Also  relax! Use the Shields so that youre not in pain because the baby will sense the change in your behaviour and not want to breastfeed. Drink lots of water and follow your gut do what is comforting.

2660448,0,t3_2qfu2c,One common method is dont offer dont refuse. So if your child communicates enough to tell you clearly when he wants to nurse you only nurse him when he asks. Another way is to reduce nursing sessions. Since you have almost a year until your weaning goal you could probably try to drop one session per month. So if babe nurses at am noon pm pm and bedtime you could drop the pm nursing now then in February drop the pm session and so on. This gives your body time to adjust. When you do drop nursing sessions it will be important to replace those nutrients somehow. Many people give a different kind of milk such as dairy almond etc to replace the calcium and other nutrients lost. Other families choose to make up those nutrients in other ways by adding cheese or yogurt for example. Great job nursing to  months and beyond mama!,breastfeeding,cn5uk29,1,t5_2rdj4

2814873,0,t3_2s8kck,It takes a long time for any sort of natural schedule to develop. My daughter didnt have somewhat predictable sleeping patterns until around  months. She has however slept well at night since birth but we bed share so that is a huge factor there. I always feed on demand only solids and breast milk.  If I think its been a while and she hasnt signaled for it then I offer but I never wake her or fuss at her to eat. IMO its not a healthy fight to have. I want my child to develop a healthy understanding that its only necessary to eat when hungry.  She sits at the dinner table but is not required to eat anything. At three months your daughter is probably changing a lot and exploring the world around her a little more looking past your face and watching things around the room.  Youre approaching a huge developmental leap around  months that will rock her sleep and eating habits. So what Im saying is it might be a really bad time to try to schedule her since her needs will change several times over the next few weeks. She will become so busy with learning that she will forget to eat and probably end up eating all night long to make up for it. She will fight to stay awake because everything is fascinating to her so putting her to sleep will be a struggle. You can help by limiting the amount of toys available to her and making sure they are age appropriate. Dont allow her near a screen TV phone tablet etc. You can take her to another room as soon as you see her rub her eyes and try to quietly nurse her to sleep. You can play very soft quiet music throughout the day to keep things calm. You can limit outings to only a few hours.  It can be a rough time on both mom and baby and no offense to the other mom that posted here but some of the techniques used in Babywise can be dangerous and are not recommended. Moms say they see results with them but there are lots of doctors psychologists and specialists that discourage using this book. So please be careful with what you read. ,breastfeeding,cno1kpz,2,t5_2rdj4
2822646,0,t3_2seycm,If youre able to pump that amount you could up Baby Bs bottle.If youre not able to pump that do not. Never send more milk than you can pump during the same time frame thats the key to keeping your supply strong.If baby B isnt getting as much as he wants from the bottle he will make up for that when hes with you extracting more milk when he nurses. He wont starve and this will keep your supply strong.Overall his daily calories are going to stay the same because were talking about a baby who gets bottles and nurses. If he gets less calories from a bottle he will nurse more calories from you. If he gets more calories from a bottle his intake from you will decrease.Although If hes already getting bottles . oz big thats on the large size I usually recommend oz max per bottle Id make sure that these are paced feedings with the newborn slowest flow nipple no matter the age of baby with baby sitting upright and bottle sideways instead of tipped up into babys mouth... The danger of larger bottles is that babies can develop a flow preference. Milk comes fast and easy from a bottle so they can eat their fill from a bottle and may choose to just eat enough to keep hunger away when at the breast. Im not saying this will happen to your baby just making you aware to watch for it. I wouldnt up them both if baby A is satisfied. Just because theyre the same age doesnt mean their growth rates will be identical.,breastfeeding,cnoxfqk,5,t5_2rdj4

2964452,0,t3_2u4b6u,I had extreme pain for the first  weeks that we tried breastfeeding I totally relate to the needlestick feelings. And I had two meetings with lactation consultants that both said they didnt see anything wrong with my nipples. I actually gave up and exclusively pumped for most of that time because I couldnt deal with the pain. My LO had a pretty severe tongue tie and we had it clipped around  weeks I think it was a very good choice for us but it didnt instantly make breastfeeding less painful. We are now breastfeeding daily with an occasional bottle and I feel zero to minimal pain. The actual procedure was less than a minute and LO only cried for like  seconds. I held him on my lap when they did it and just a little cuddle right after calmed him back down. I could immediately tell he was able to use his tongue more easily sticking it out and moving it more freely. Im also pretty sure this helped make breastfeeding easier down the road for us.For what its worth we didnt circumcise either and I agree with your feelings on unnecessary procedures but Im thankful we had this done and I think it brought many benefits that outweighed the momentary discomfort he felt.,breastfeeding,co52nmo,2,t5_2rdj4

But I will do whatever is necessary! Thanks for the link and info on milk fat Im hoping the MD tomorrow can shed some light on my daughters slow weight gain. Maybe its nothing to be concerned about. The nurse on Friday said its ok if they stay in the same percentile as birth but my daughter has dropped quite a bit. Not sure what she was at birth she was . and . so Id say in the average range ieth maybe? but now shes below . She might just have high metabolism like me.

4079785,0,t3_37bdyj,Here in Japan its expected and encouraged by the medical profession to breastfeed until at least  year old but I wouldnt say that society is supportive of it in general. Its supposed to be something done quietly at home out of view. More and more shopping malls are providing nursing rooms but otherwise theres really no place to do it and you cant just whip it out wherever. I used to structure my errands around the few available nursing rooms in town. I also just did it in the car in a pinch but I have no idea how women who live in big cities and dont own cars do it. Theres no place to do it in train stations generally and people would go nuts if a woman just whipped out a boob on the train. Theres also no support for pumping or nursing in the workplace so most women wean before they go back. The law allows us to take up to a year of leave though so its not an issue for most people.Breastfeeding past two isnt common at all. Most working moms seem to wean by one and stay at home moms by two. I have yet to meet anyone here who breastfed past two. Doctors and midwives usually say to breastfeed as long as both mother and child want to so I dont think they would discourage it past two. The discouragement if there is any is more likely to come from grandmas and mothers in law.,breastfeeding,crlbkjn,7,t5_2rdj4

We cut down on outings and did at least one good feed in the bed with closed curtains and a sound machine.  A lot of babies tend to sort of reverse cycle during this so they will take the bulk of their milk in at night. Bottle fed babies dont because they can still eat and look around at the world.

You want a flange size  mm bigger than your measurement typically. Measure a couple times over a few days because it can fluctuate.In my experience the less areola that gets sucked in the more comfortable you will be.

Your sanity is SO much more important to those babies and your entire family than anything else you can do for them. Care for yourself be patient with yourself and give yourself a lot of grace especially with parenting decisions. They more than likely will be in the nicu for even a short amount of time. Get handsfree pumping accessories and pump there where you can see them and even kangaroo them while you pump. My sister has a hospital grade pump rented! at home and one in the nicu so she can pump when she visits. I completely second the poster who suggested using donated milk as a supplement. Maybe get in touch with your LLL and explain what is going on. They may be able to hook you up with a few other mamas who are willing to give you their extras.

4417664,0,t3_3bltl6,I sent  oz. to daycare while my baby was  months old then gradually dropped to  oz. once she started solids. When we were doing  oz I would generally feed her at am then pump at work until pm so  hours between last feed and last pump. That worked well for us and the baby was happy and gained weight well. But daycare would periodically request more milk. Even at  months were still dealing with this although no one has said anything to me since I yelled at the head lady. They would request more milk because the baby cried after she finished a bottle even if she wasted milk the day before or the bottle before. I think daycare workers just assume if the baby cries heshe must be hungry. In our case it tended to either be gas or sleepiness associates milk with naps since I nurse her to sleep.  Maybe try lying to your daycare and telling them that the baby has GERD and must have paced feedings? And also let them know that the baby eats more milk at home different than formulafed babies since theres no incentive to push feedings to when the baby is at home. It sounds like youre substituting pumping sessions for breastfeeding just to let daycare feed the baby extra milk which doesnt seem like a great deal for you.,breastfeeding,csnlsya,2,t5_2rdj4

In the hospital they made sure as soon as LO was born he was chest to chest and within  minutes they got him to latch on.  They also had lactation consultants come to the hospital room multiple times to check latch etc. There was a mini course thing we had to go for for  min before they would discharge us on breastfeeding benefits positions etc. Then they set up an appointment for  days after discharge to go to a community health centre to meet with a lactation consultant and make she he was gaining or not losing too much. I dont have a Ped just a regular doctor and she lets me breastfeed in her appointment rooms because he always want to eat there. The first appointment after the hospital she asked for me to feed him in front of her to make sure his latch  everything was okay. She hasnt asked how long Ill EBF for but I imagine she assumes a minimum of  year since thats what most people do around here.

4724753,0,t3_3fn2dp,Absolutely!  The body is very adaptable.  I have a friend who has done a combination for all  of her kids.  She is self employed so she is unable to pump at work.  It may be a little uncomfortable to abruptly stop pumping.  I would pump less frequently for a few days until you are done.  Also make sure your LO can tolerate formula.

4839739,0,t3_3h5rk8,EPer here. I have always gotten less output from lefty. It also seems like it could do with more suction than what righty needs but I just keep on trucking with them both on the same speed. I make up for the speed with hardermore compressions on that side. Its very common so common its basically normal to get different amounts from each side. Left is slow and steady with a smaller amount and right is niagra falls work horse for me.I would ditch the serperate sessions and just do both breasts at the same speed unless doing so means you dont get anything from the one side. My bet is that if you relax and zone out doing something else while pumping you can get the same results in one session. Not to mean that the other will make the same amount as the other breast just that even on a lower setting given enough time it will produce the same as it would while on a higher setting.,breastfeeding,cu4l5b7,2,t5_2rdj4

5158832,0,t3_3ln65i,I had my first kid  months ago and remember being so upset over similar issues.  Mine would clamp on my nipple and sit there or push it back out with her tongue. The nurses and LC told me that she would get it in a couple of days and prescribed a schedule with some astronomical amount of expressed milk she should be getting and that I was not producing.  I felt frustrated and like a huge failure every feeding she not sucking  frantically trying to express giving her a bottle and being afraid she would develop a preference.  I was upset that I had to supplement with formula because everyone gets drilled that breast is best and arent really prepared to use formula.  I started pumping enough milk a couple weeks in but she didnt really go for the nipple until  weeks and then it hurt like hell because she wasnt latching correctly and I had to apply nipple ointment after each feed.  It got to the point where the LCs told me there was not much more they could do.  So it took her  months to finally do it without hurting me.  All the while I was pumping and keeping a supply in the fridge for every time we couldnt breastfeed properly. I wanted to quit every step of the way and my partner would not have faulted me for it.  And I learned that I was raised on formula from day one so whatever!  Please let your partner know that her health is paramount and to breathe.  Turns out most people feel frantic and like its one step forward and two steps back with a newborn.  And dont let the shit ton of information on the interwebs cloud her mothering instincts. It feels like your baby needs to follow a tight schedule or its game over but thats not true.  Babies dont follow schedules set by other people.

After about a week I started helping out in the bed time routine and only asked occasionally to nurse. I dont think I could of done it alone.

We were so busy with breastfeeding doctor and nurse visits and just learning to be a family that we didnt miss the visitors. Once we got home we slowly trickled people in for two weeks. I would develop a plan with your SO and decide whats best for you and communicate the plan early so there are no surprises.,breastfeeding,cwyzysd,1,t5_2rdj4

5693358,0,t3_3t2n3s, mo was a really hard age for us. Seriously I feel like I wrote this post. Our feeding frequency dropped down from every  hrs to every  hrs around then. It was so confusing and I was worried she was weaning. What really helps me is to just kind of go with the flow. If shes happy and doesnt want to nurse fine. As long as your lo is growing properly and hitting milestones I wouldnt worry that shes not nursing enough. Where youre at now is just her new normal til it changes again soon . There are times when I am convinced it will be over teething...ughh but then well have a good nursing session for us min total is long and I look at her and realize shes nowhere near weaning.

5795027,0,t1_cxf5g6j,Yes they do eat less sometimes. It really varies from baby to baby and time to time. Sometimes my daughter would eat a ton of solids and a ton of milk other days she would eat a ton of solids and then barely want to feed. Other times she would only want to BF and would refuse her solids. I would recommend against the faster nipples  its best for breastfed babies to stay on the slow ones as you want it to be closest to breastfeeding.

It doesnt mean they arent getting enough milk now it is how they ensure they will get enough in the future.

6108579,0,t3_3z6lyc,Everyone else has made great points and had great input. I just want to jump in to address the part where you mentioned that she expects you to do all of the night time bottle feedings. As EXHAUSTING as the first few months are for a nursing mother and everyone else involved I think that it is super important for her to be nursing or pumping every single time your child needs to eat. If she has to use a pump to try to increase supply but you are giving baby a bottle of formula that is fine  but as someone above mentioned it is all about supply and demand and if your wife doesnt have an established supply than skipping any feedings is detrimental to her efforts to build her supply.I am no expert  so definitely use your best resources and judgement. I just wanted to toss in that detail because I didnt see anyone above address it.Lastly  remember to just love on and support your wife. Newborns are rough the lack of sleep is exhausting and difficult for the whole family and whether or not she has PPD there are still a million emotions to deal with.

I feel like Id get annoyed being around them that much though haha My MIL has been very passive aggressively questioning my parenting choices lately and after today Im thinking i need a break from her. Which sucks cause my hubby is going to the exact opposite side of the country for a week for work starting Sunday and I want to cry lol Totally unrelated but sort of related to how Im going crazy.. My LO SCREAMS bloody murder  times out of  when we are in the car. Its horrific. Therefore I dont go further that  minutes away from home when Im by myself. Even if hubby can drive and I can sit in the back Im not comfortable going more than  minutes. Things have been really really really hard with how fussy he is and to me its just not worth getting him soo worked up and upset just to go to someones house or something. They can just come to us until we figure it out. Well she lives  mins away and the other day she came over and was like Well hes just going to need to learn to deal with it. I got SO PISSED! I was like Well unfortunately thats not how babies freaking work. Shes been saying so much shit lately but is so nice and like passive aggressive about it that it gets under my skin but I dont know how to respond to it half the time. I just tell her shes old school and Im doing it my way. Well now my way apparently isnt freaking good enough. Holy hell im still irritated and its been nearly twelve hours. I like cant even sleep because of it. They all like talked behind my back before they came over too. Ugh I just dont even have words anymore. And my husband sort of backed me up. He was at work so he wasnt there to defend me. But hes so passive and not opinionated that he probably wouldnt have said anything. But when they finished what they were saying I left to go to the pharmacy so I could call my husband because I wanted to cry. He said they were doing it out of love and said maybe they were right. Soooooo idk if I had his support. And I called my mom crying and she later called me back after talking to MIL and she said she sort of agreed with MIL but trusts my decisions. I educated her more about EBF and reflux and she eventually agreed with me. So as of right now my only family support is ONE of his cousins who is a total crunchy granola mom and is  on my side and has been sending me articles to show to everyone who has shit to say. Shes a saint. Its just so stressful when basically no one is backing me up and everyone is trying to force me to supplement and wont listen.

But by  weeks we were set! It wasnt painful she was getting more efficient and less fussy it was great.If you can find an ibclc reach out to them for help I had  visits and they made a world of difference!

6365083,0,t3_42m3gp,My son couldnt latch because I too had short smaller nipples. He used the shield for maybe  weeks on one side  weeks on the other. Eventually my nipples became more breastfeedingfriendly. It took the right one a little longer because I favored nursing on the left for awhile. My son started to hate the shield and would do better without it. Now were completely off the thing which is SO nice because Im not worrying about losing it all the time. One thing I would try earlier on which did work was starting with the shield and then taking it away after a minute and seeing if he would latch after that. The shield would sort of prep the nipple and put it in a better shape. You should give that a try. Also coconut oil will help if your nipples are cracked. They will toughen up eventually though as long as you establish a proper latch. I think that babies get better at latching with age too. Like I said it took my boy a couple months to get really good at it. Another thing make sure youre pointing your nipple upwards toward the roof of her mouth when trying to get a good latch. Thats one of the tricks that really helped me. ,breastfeeding,czd51fq,2,t5_2rdj4

I had zero luck with an electric pump I tried a  manual just to see if there would be a difference. It has a soft flange that makes the vacuum more comfortable and I can better feel when it comes away and loses the vacuum.Pumping was torture with my first I would be attached for  minutes and end up with drops to show for it.I have a very small capacity in the first place I can only get  oz TOTAL between my breasts but with the manual pump and learning how to hand express lots of fiddling but once I find the right spot I can have a stream come out for as long as I keep squeezing.

I try not to pump within  hours of getting him back since hes not a big eater when hes away and he usually wants a boob pronto.  I leave the pump on until I cant get any extra milk out when I massage my breasts.

I had to psych myself up before he nursed every time. Then one day it didnt hurt. And it was glorious. It took us a good  weeks though. You never get completely empty. Youll probably notice some engorgement now as your body tries to figure out how much milk you need but that will taper out as you get into a routine. Start with one side and let baby nurse as long as he wants. When he pops off burp him then offer the other side. When he pops off again burp him and you can probably be done.  The next time start on that second side and repeat the process. There are some apps you can keep track with or bracelets or other methods if you want. I was so foggy I couldnt remember my left from right.Hell fall asleep and its probably fine. Is he jaundice at all? Thats really the main concern Ive heard for babies falling asleep nursing. Being jaundice makes them sleepy but they need to eat to get the bilirubin out so it becomes a cycle.  Otherwise its alright for him to get sleepy. You can put your finger in the corner of his mouth to unlatch him. Some people prefer to implement a sleep eat wake routine to help with sleep routines but thats a personal preference.

My son is  months old now and still breastfed and although he eats lots of real food now Ive never given him any rice flour. Breastmilk has enzymes that prevent the rice flour from thickening the milk anyway. The sleeping stretches will probably become longer on their own but between around  months their sleep generally gets worse before getting better again! My son slept the worst when he was four months then it got better. For me the doctor at the consultatiebureau only has advice that sounds like shes really talking about formula but is just calling it breastfeeding instead haha like she suggested to water the milk down at night feeds... Huh. But the nurse is a lot better informed! I also got the  x weight in kg  number of feeds advice but the lactation consultant where I bought my pump said thats only up to   months after that it stabilizes because growth slows down.

7435838,0,t3_4h4gvp,This sounds very normal to me.  I had a slight oversupply in the beginning my LO is  weeks now and your baby sounds just like mine was. Spit up is totally normal especially early on since babys bellydigestive tract is still developing. Some babies have more sensitive gag reflexes too which can make them happy spitters. The important thing to remember is that she is probably not spitting up everything in her stomach. It may seem like a lot but its ok. If she is hungry after spitting up she will let you know.  Hiccups grunting etc. are also normal newborn behaviors. They will likely become less frequent as she gets older. Try burping her in the middle of a feed and at the end to see if that helps with the spit up. She may be getting a bit of gas in her stomach when feeding and excess gas can lead to spitting up too. Good luck!,breastfeeding,d2neo0e,1,t5_2rdj4

7626206,0,t3_4jr7b2,I continued to nurse my daughter until she was around . years old.  We continued the same routine from roughly yr to mo and then I tried to break the sleepnursing association.  I wasnt successful and ended up nursing before nap as well as bedtime with overnight and comfort nursing sessions until about  years.  Then from  years until a little after . my daughter only nursed to sleep and then phased that out too.  I went through periods where it was painful due to teething and biting but managed to work through them.  I stopped admitting that we were continuing to nurse due to it just being easier but obviously still did it and most people knew that.  The real reason we stopped nursing was that I got pregnant and it became too painful and tiring to continue.

7777047,0,t3_4lt5ib,Just wondering any reason you werent prescribed a mini pill the breastfeeding safe pill? Talk to your doctor but you prob need to switch to a different method of birth control to breastfeed. It also depends on your baby at this point. There is no guarantee she will want to latch on. She is used to bottles and may be compeletly unintrested in boobs when offered. BEFORE STARTING THIS PROCESS  switch to a breastfeeding safe method of birth control. A good idea would be to contact a lactation consultant to help you though if you are serious about this. Advice on the internet is not the same as a pro guiding you in person.  Another thing you probably wont get to the point of EBF. Your daughter is likely already having some solids anyway. It would be difficult though not unheard of for you to be produce enough to be able to stop all formula. A few feedings a day in addition to the formula may be more a realistic goal. Either way.  THE BASICS OF RELACTATION Take lacotogenic supplements. All guns firing  mothers milk tea fenugreek capsules lactation cookies whatever you can get you hands on. I dont usually go for herbal remedies but I can testify from personal experience that they can really work at least for some people. I took two doses of one once and got super crazy engorged.  The one I tried had alfalfa anis fenugreek fennel and thistle.  At the same time pump every few hours. Continue pumping a few minutes after nothing comes out.  Offer the breast  try to get your baby to latch on before or after every meal and try to keep her on for as long as possible.  Nursing vacation   take a weekend to only focus on nusing drink a lot eat well sleep as much as possible and nurse as much as you can get your daughter to.  If those efforts dont wield results there are some medicines that can bring in milk but they need to be prescribed so talk to a doctor.

We have Co slept since birth and like I said I was her Pacifier so if she was upset I would pick her up and have her on my chest where she could get to the breast if she wanted. Do you offer both sides at each feed? When baby is feeling full and content you see their arms relax and flop and their body relaxes and they come off the breast by themself. You know then they have had a good feed and not just fell asleep at the breast. Id personally ditch the Pacifier let baby seek comfort from you and at  weeks could be hitting a growth spurt so is upping your supply by Suckling.

Every baby is different of course so yrmv but a weekend of bottles and formula isnt a death sentence to breastfeeding.I would get some formula beforehand and try it just to make sure hell take it and it doesnt upset his tummy. You dont want to find out that it wont work once youre already away from him. My pediatrician recommended the similac thats formulated for breastfeeding moms who supplement.

7846085,0,t3_4msdqy,Are you doing skin to skin now? Even after the birth it really helps. I would keep her skin to skin at the breast as much as possible. If its nipple confusion pumping and feeding may be your best bet but I would still keep her at the breast so your body responds to her attempts to feed because your body responds better to the baby than the pump as far as increasing production. Also do you have a lactation consultant? How about contacting a local La Leche League chapter? Best of luck to you. Youre doing an amazing job mama.,breastfeeding,d3xyvxz,2,t5_2rdj4

Some people prefer starting with fruits cos its tastier and sweeter but some people dislike it precisely for that reason. Serve the food like a dessert after bottle feeding and be prepared for the baby to reject the food. Supposedly you need to let them try something  ? times before they get used to it. Most of my girlfriends would steam and blend a fruitveg and freeze them in ice cube trays then defrost when required. Youre right cereal is really old fashioned.

8535405,0,t3_4wnqly,Hi!Congratulations on your little one! That early on milk supply is kind of crazy and not established in a regular schedule. Mine didnt level out until  or  months. You can definitely work it back up but it might be hard to do strictly pumping. Nothing is going to be better at draining your boob than your baby. Not that you cant though. Nothin wrong with pumping! Pump as much as you can.I would also say as much skin on skin as you can that will help with your milk supply. Especially if youre exclusively pumping. Snuggle that baby!  I made lactation cookies and ate a ton of oatmeal in the early days. Have you talked to a lactation consultant? I had a ton of issues in the beginning with my little mans latch and was using nipple shields all the time. Leaking constantly not having a good time at all! But now my dude is  months and were nursing great. No shields and latch issues thanks to a good LC. Glad to have you here!Edit Two other things. One it doesnt really matter how many MLs your baby is eating. As long as they are having enough wetdirty diapers and gaining wait youre good. Also it really helped my supply to drink a TON of water.

Now though I would highly suggest trying a more relaxedsupportive position or you plus a whole bunch of skin to skin before feeds in particular. Look up videos on laid back breastfeeding or natural breastfeeding positions. Babies are extremely sensitive to stress or muscle tension in the caregiver so if you feel relaxed and supported the better the odds will be that she will want to snuggle up to that boob for a nice feed. Also look up some videos on mindfulness or breathing exercises that can also help ease the stress.

And youre right youre not going through the same things she is so its very hard to understand. Most would say that since it is her body its inevitably up to her to discontinue breastfeeding but you are certainly entitled to have a say since its your baby too. In my opinion a happy mom and happy baby are more important than what the baby eats. She needs to be at her  best to be able to love and care that baby properly. There is enough stress going on in her life right now that if cutting out one things means shes a little more sane she needs to do it. But the best thing you can do is just support her and tell her shes doing great. Positive words are more encouraging than anything.

9632449,0,t3_5celt6,Im incredibly late to this party but here are my two cents.Im a sociologist so I approach this issue from a different angle. I have no proof if breastfeeding is way better marginally better the same or worse than formula feeding.What I do know from my experience sample size n is that breastfeeding is feeding my kid but also providing so many intangibles.Crying kid?  Boob. Done.Sleepy kid?  Boob. Done.Scared kid?  Boob. Done.Angry kid?  Boob. Done.Sick kid?  Boob. Done.My littlest was severely ill a few months ago and he was virtually inconsolable when not allowed to nurse.  When I was forced to pump and bottle feed him he refused to eat. The NG tube got the food in but he would just whimper during all of his waking hours.I dont know how it stacks up for those who have to exclusively pump or who have issues with latching or who dont have adequate leave from work to make it happen.  Those realities have not been mine though I do know what its like to muddle through on  of my income like a lot of my friendsacquaintances do Canadian leave is great but it is a privileged minority who get employer topups and who can afford it without sacrifice.While the food may be simply no betterno worse I think the myriad comforts it offers really make the difference.,breastfeeding,da0ebds,2,t5_2rdj4
9648632,0,t3_5d7ahk,Geez thats rough! It sucks to read about whats normal when your baby is doing something completely different. Both my boys have breastfed very differently. My younger one clusterfed every night for hours from around  or  weeks. Daytime feeding was frequent but not lengthy. I really wasnt expecting it as my first kid would take large regular feeds every  or so hours. When you go back to work will you pump or do formula while youre away? That might help with the daytime feeding frequency if shes having it from bottles. I totally understand why you dont want to cosleep you need to do whats best for you and your baby. Nursing can be awesome or it can be pretty awful. If it doesnt work out for you thats ok. And if you keep going thats ok too.

Many doctors have outmoded plans and expectations for breastfed babies i.e. no idea of what breastfeeding after  months let alone a year looks like so they make recommendations theyve heard another doctor make.  If you continue with this doctor ask him for research that supports this recommendation.  That worked for me when our ped said we should nurse less because my daughter had a slightly low iron level.  Fortunately I knew enough to point out that what he was thinking of was cows milk and he was willing to try to pull research he couldnt find it and we supplemented and the next test was fine.,breastfeeding,dc86dff,2,t5_2rdj4
10286782,0,t3_5n921p,So Im by no means an expert but I went through the same thing with my LO in November also a FTM. Those days of feeding pumping and supplementing were exhausting but they didnt last. It felt like all I did was feed the baby. I quickly dropped the evening pumps for the sake of my sleep and only pumped after feedings.Once LO started gaining he started eating better he started rejecting the supplemental milk so we eventually quit doing it we just played it by ear.  It lasted maybe a week or two in full swing. It took him until  weeks to get back to birth weight. But once he started gaining he took off. Instead of looking at when he pops off my breast as a sign hes full I look at how relaxed his armshands are. A lot of times when he pops off if hes still tense a burp or switching sides would be enough for him to continue eating. I tickle his mouth with my nipple when he pops off to see of hell take more.Every question youre asking about if the baby is getting enough ran through my mind as well. It still does sometimes. I weigh him every week still and every pound is my own little victory.

10555494,0,t3_5r4ywr,BIG HUGS! Seek an opinion from a different lactation consultant  preferably an International Board Certified LC.  Low supply cannot be fixed by fenugreek etc that can have the opposite effect if you have any thyroid issues. You know you can do this so the issue isnt with low breast tissue. It is likely your babys ability to transfer the milk. Oral ties seem like a fad these days but they can be a real problem and if you want to breastfeed then I would seek an opinion on these. A regular GP midwife child health nurse etc dont have the specialised training for this. My friend saw  separate health professionals before being given a proper diagnosis by an IBCLC and after having the ties revised at a dentist. Prior to that she had cracked nipples her baby couldnt latch properly and she had  bouts of mastitis.Sorry if Ive rambled a bit.

10635781,0,t3_5s5imt,I nursed throughout my second pregnancy and am now in the process of weaning my toddler mo into tandem nursing.  Heres my experienceI found my milk came in pretty quickly at about  days postpartum and I produced quite a lot.  The great thing about nursing a toddler and a newborn at the same time is that the toddler can help quite a bit with the initial engorgement.  I also noticed a bit of a weight gain in my toddler because it she was suddenly getting all this rich fatty milk.  One thing no one mentioned to me before is that newborn milk tends to have a bit of a laxative effect so if you nurse your toddler a lot be prepared for some yucky poops in the first few weeks.As for going out and positioning since my daughter was .yo when the baby came we hadnt nursed in public for quite some time so I didnt have to worry about that.  When we nursed at home I would set up the baby in a cradle position using a nursing pillow for support and then my toddler would cuddle up on the free side and just lean over to nurse.Finally right now Im in the process of weaning my yr old.  Im quite happy I got to  years but nursing two at a time is exhausting and I feel touched out much of the time.  My SO and I tackled nightweaning first.  When the baby came she started waking up more frequently and wanting to nurse whenever the baby did so my husband had to take over all night wakings.  Next we tackled nursing to sleep and it was the same deal...bedtime has become my husbands domain.  So as it stands right now she nurses when she wakes up before naptime if she asks and after supper.  I count to  then shes done.  Sometimes theres a bit of whining but I remind her when the next time she can nurse is.  My plan is to cut out the naptime nursing session in a week then supper and leave the morning nursing session for last.Personally I found it really important to set up some boundaries for when and how long my toddler could nurse because she wanted to be on me All. The. Time.  But ultimately youll find a groove that works for you.,breastfeeding,ddczzn7,2,t5_2rdj4

10693330,0,t3_5sr13e,Try helping your LO get a better latch. I know easier said than done. Dont be afraid to make him unlatch and latch again until it feels better. It might help to gently open his bottom lip a bit to help him get a good one.  In addition you can use nipple creams to help with any soreness from cracked or dry nipples. I use mother love nipple cream and it was a godsend since my son improperly latched at first and my nipples became super dry and cracked. It helped a lot!  Also you can check with a lactation consultant for some feedback. Im pretty sure most insurances cover it if the hospital already didnt offer when you have birth.  Hope it all gets better!

You attach the syringe on the other end and then they suck out the syringe volume and you dont lose a drop! Otherwise the ml syringes are very thin and you can insert it into their mouth while they are on the breast. Last option would be to just squirt small amounts in their mouth like you were giving a med and letting them swallow it. I would suggest squirting toward the back cheek and going slow. ,breastfeeding,dds8al6,2,t5_2rdj4

Both my mom and my mother in law breastfed their kids my husband was super supportive and most of my friends have also breastfed.My biggest hurdle to breastfeeding was my postpartum recovery I had a long labour and difficult delivery  which made it quite painful to sit upright. When we took my daughter back to the hospital for her bilirubin test  the nurse administering the test was also an LC and had been informed of my delivery by the LampD nurses. When she asked if I was in pain I was toughing it out  and my husband intervened and told her how I was really feeling. She showed us some other positions that I might find more comfortable and gave my husband some tips on how to help us  side lying was very successful for us during my recovery.

You are a great mom and I wish I could give you a big hug. First off I havent had your exact set of problems but lord have I had difficulties! Tongue and lip ties engorgement painful letdown oversupply which is actually awful silent reflux and a total lack of support from friends family and medical professionals. But I dont want this to be about me! If you feel like reading about my silent reflux experience heres the post I made yesterday I think youre doing the right thing seeing a new LC. I truly believed if I had gotten better medical support in the beginning I would not have gone down the rabbit hole of PPD. And if this new LC doesnt seem to work see someone else. Have you tried any support groups? Momtomom groups are great and it helps to talk to others who are in the trenches. Plus the social aspect does wonders for mental health. Also if you have a support person who lives with you have a sitdown serious talk with them about helping you. Even just sitting up for part of the nursing session helps take the edge off of feeling horrible. Insist on this. Even if they have to get up and go to work the next day! Dont pull those long nights alone because you will go crazy. I know from experience. If you dont have a support person or if they are being poopy about helping hit me up in a PM.  I live in the Eastern Time Zone in the United States. Chances are if you live in the same hemisphere Im up at some point when youre up! Im totally down for Skyping or just PMing. I truly hope that you get the help and support you need. No matter the outcome you are doing the right thing. You are feeding your baby and thats the best! Sending love from LO and I. ,breastfeeding,dfifj02,2,t5_2rdj4

11358939,0,t3_61z7sb,I had a clogged duct that lasted about  and a half days. I was nursing pumping everything I could think of. I almost asked my husband to nurse to get it unplugged! Just kidding. I finally must have cracked the code because I had been nursing with a heat pack stuffed inbetween my boob and arm and when my son unlatched I massaged it a little bit. I saw the tiniest droplets come out of most of my nipple but then no kidding a LASER of breast milk came out of one duct and shot across the living room. I was on the couch and it almost hit the TV. I was able to hand express until I felt all the hardness gone. ,breastfeeding,dfjijpc,2,t5_2rdj4

11435836,0,t1_dfqwgle,This has been my experience almost exactly. My son is three and baby is a couple weeks old  sometimes my toddler asks me not to feed the baby but I tell him I have to and we need him to grow big and strong so hell have someone to okay with. Im also a bit lad with screen time since we are still learning what our new normal is. ,breastfeeding,dfs8ofo,1,t5_2rdj4

11572906,0,t1_dg7qwpd,Thanks for the encouragement uGentleJoanna. Im usually gone  hrs so I expect him to need no more than  oz. I think the hard part is that they dont want him to fuss or cry at all especially because hes a happy baby overall. Its breaking my heart for him to fuss at the breast and seem like he dislikes it more and more though! I cant handle the idea of letting it go just when breastfeeding was getting good! ,breastfeeding,dg7smnl,1,t5_2rdj4
11597622,0,t3_65g34k,My little girl didnt want a bottle.  Mostly itd be that one quarter ounce would drip into her mouth over the course of ten to fifteen mins with her pushing away and screaming around the teat we were being nagged to top her up due to poor weight gain.  We tried a handful of times but it was little interest through to outrage on her part so we said no more.Shes  months old now loves her solids but bf still going strong and uninterested in drinking from a sippy.  She will bite at liquids in an open topped cup and shes fairly gleeful whenever she can get at your drink.  Worth a try perhaps?My little guy wasnt interested in solids till nearer  months and what turned the tide for him was an auntie feeding him a few spoons of chocolate mousse. After that he had a different attitude towards trying food instead of just throwing whatever he could grab.  Controversial maybe I didnt want to feed him chocolate but it got him eating so I guess that worked out ok.Its not easy when you are alone all week  are there any baby and toddler groups nearby?  I have a few I go to with volunteers that are often grandparents themselves.  Theyve been there and they understand which I find helps.  Theres usually somebody more than happy to snuggle baby for a little bit too.,breastfeeding,dgalkm9,2,t5_2rdj4

11620811,0,t3_65tz37,I think pump and dump is out for like wine with dinner. If youre planning on going hard in the paint Id say pump and dump it. No shame in having a drunken good time I have a wedding this year and the same plan as you amp im just planning to pump him enough bottles before then pump amp dump if I get engorged while intoxicated.  Party on sister. ,breastfeeding,dgd8a5h,8,t5_2rdj4
11639279,0,t1_dgfblaf,Mm yeah thats what I wondered. So clearly Im no professional  just bfd  kids  but I think that a safer way to up hindmilk that wont risk reducing supply would be massaging the breast during your feeding or right before I always think people who suggest doing things before feedings are out of their minds... like your LO is just going to sit there waiting!. Ive heard from an LC I totally trust theres a study showing fat content increases  when you massage at the back of the breast.  ,breastfeeding,dgfbqbb,7,t5_2rdj4

11723133,0,t3_679qns,I unfortunately dont have much advice other than be strong. It seems like you are doing everything right. We cant force our babies to grow and some things are out of our hands. I just cant imagine CPS being called for poor weight growth. My daughter was a premie and was super small forever. My doctor would have never added that extra stress just for weight gain. Im sorry you are going through this. Just feed your baby without over feedingmaking him sick and he will be just fine. Does your doctor say to do anything else? ,breastfeeding,dgouiim,9,t5_2rdj4
11736220,0,t1_dgqa048,Thank you so much for responding. We have a warmer and have tried it at all various temps but I will keep trying!,breastfeeding,dgqbwbk,2,t5_2rdj4
11769687,0,t1_dgtunv8,Ok. If you thaw the milk in the fridge its good for  hours after its defrosted. If you thaw it in cool water in the sink you have  hours to use the milk. My son only drinks  oz at a time from the bottle. So his caretaker puts oz of thawed milk and a teaspoon of pure and mixes. Its still quite thin it isnt meant to fill him up quicker just to take the edge off the soapy flavor. He seems to like Applebananaorange mixture in his bottles BUT if you havent started purees yet I would only try this with a single fruit like apple. You want to be sure Baby doesnt have a reaction to the pure and using a multiple ingredient flavor will make it difficult to determine the cause if your baby has a reaction. This worked for us I hope it helps you! ,breastfeeding,dgu4ihd,3,t5_2rdj4
