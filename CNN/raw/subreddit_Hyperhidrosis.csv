4210371,0,t1_cs05ibz,Robinul might work I guess. I just googled it and it doesnt seem like something I really want to come in contact with to be honest. My hyperhidrosis is severe but the treatment is what makes it go away. For example if I do a  to  minute treatment everyday for about  days I can afford to go a  weeks without any treatment and there will be no sweaty palms incident. I understand it is a long treatment but I just watch a  to  minute television series on my tablet while doing it.

8353641,0,t3_4tiwl3,HawaiicanalIm a  year old male suffering from hyperhidrosis. Always told that I will grow out of it. Ive been feeling heartbroken lately because of this symptom. Im constantly avoiding handshakes always fist bumping but thats unprofessional especially since I work in bank data center. I always felt jealous of couples holding hands during the summer. The only time I was able to hold a relationship was when drysol was working and now that stuff has been starting to wear off and Im afraid to even touch girls but its helped my pickup game since I have to try THAT much harder lol but physical touch is critical. I sweat all over my keyboard I cant even use my iphone properly and I can tell its slowly wearing me down building anxiety. I want to this to stop. Ive been on glyco on and off I hate the side effects and Ive been looking into iontophoresis machines. I built one when I was  from the infamous youtube video but I didnt take it seriously because drysol was working.  Thanks. Goodluck to everyone wish you the best of luck getting dry.,Hyperhidrosis,d5lrb0q,1,t5_2rhwk

8612629,0,t1_d6htq16,Its a challenge to stop eating foods you love but for me its all been how I frame it in my mind. I want more than anything else in the world to have relief from IBS and HH. When I affix that goal in my mind theres no single food I would eat to compromise that  not even pizza.If you can similarly motivate yourself Id recommend following basically a paleo diet though it doesnt have to be that strict. High fat high protein low carb low sugar. Basically eliminating all the most basic triggers wheat gluten sugar dairy beans alcohol or at least opt for wine over beerliquor.Id also recommend a good nonpsyllium fiber supplement. Im finding this product to be a miracle.,Hyperhidrosis,d6i6bud,1,t5_2rhwk
8758214,0,t1_d6zuvno,yep the effect is immediate you can take it here and there and it should do it. About taking it on an empty stomach or not well I didnt feel any difference personally while taking it with or without food although eating  hours after taking the tab feels like the effect lowers so I guess it works best if you keep an empty stomach after taking it.about alcohol well from my experience I didnt feel anything out of order maybe a little faster heart rate but not on a dangerous level.,Hyperhidrosis,d70fpeq,1,t5_2rhwk

11074123,0,t3_5xymee,ETS is not necessary and carries significant risk. Dont even consider it until youve done extensive research and exhausted every possible resource. It can make your condition even worse. As far as what to do next that depends. Have you tried Drysol long enough to know if it works? Thats a good drug to start on. Do you have medical benefits? The next step would be to visit a doctor and get a prescription or referral to a dermatologist. Theres several non invasive treatments like anticholinergic drugs and iontophoresis. You can safely build your own iontophoresis machine and try it. ,Hyperhidrosis,den8pt3,2,t5_2rhwk
