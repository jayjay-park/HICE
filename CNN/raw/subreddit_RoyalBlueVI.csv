5665233,0,t3_3sofnw,Yeah do something relaxing and then go to bed. Maybe you could also use this In buddhism they meditate a lot. They want to learn that they are not their thoughts. Noone can suppress all thoughts but one can learn to accept their thoughts embrace them and then let them pass away. So you are not angry you feel anger. Try to recognize the difference when you are experiencing negative emotions.And dont fap. Fapping will not let your anger fade away it will just suppress it. It will be back sooner or later together with emotions of loneliness and unhappiness. Beware my fellow soldier! Be strong!We are loyal we are true!,RoyalBlueVI,cwzbskt,1,t5_3ap8o

5741778,0,t3_3tsazs,Hello there  I just woke up and Im a bit tired as well Im just having a really tight schedule recently. Theres nothing a large cup of coffee  wont fix  For example yesterday I had like  hours of time only for myself since the early morning I was tutoring and then I went over to the people Ive met last Tuesday and we played some more  board games they seem really fun both the games and the folks by the way . And then I visited my other friends and the day has ended. So theres that still holding on and everything is on the right track. Hope youre doing well too brethren!,RoyalBlueVI,cx8tn96,1,t5_3ap8o
