6029050,0,t1_cy9x4aa,Ive gotten permission from Monster to work on a Conquest mod so thats not an issue. What we currently need in order to make this happen is additional input from the community in the form of potential features we want in the mod and most importantly someone to do the coding for it.I believe you brought up possibly making a forge mod for it?,ConquestResourcepack,cy9xf30,1,t5_35yxh
