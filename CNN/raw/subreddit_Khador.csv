880173,0,t1_ch4ayos,That is some good advice and no offense was taken. I actually purchased eSorscha a couple days after this match so it wasnt actually an option. We were playing incursion by the way. I still had trouble though getting to his Incindiarii before they were able to really take out a lot of my models. My great bears didnt survive much longer with CRA and continuous fire he was able to kill  of them before they made it into melee. I also got unlucky on my feat turn and about  of my WGI infantry missed their attacks needed s to hit on  dice.And some of the ones that did connect just did AWFUL damage rolled a number of  or s on  dice even one  for good measure they were firing at dice minus .  I ended up only killing  on feat turn and left another  on just a couple boxes. His next turn he just brought them back and continued to open fire pretty much killing off my WGI.  I didnt want to originally bring up the dice because it happens to everyone from time to time it cant be helped. As for list building you make good suggestions on how to go about. He is really the only opponent that I have had this issue with. I really dont like to accuse people of suspicious behavior in case it is unintentional. With that said there have been a few times where he has asked me what my models do WHILE he is list building. That should have been a tip off in those instances. while he is selecting models he asks things like how much stealthmagic weaponsAoEs I have...thats not cool lol.,Khador,ch4butu,1,t5_2yw9e

1644358,0,t1_cjm0rs1,Tournament   My lists again were Butcher  and Butcher Battle   Got the bye hate byes at tournaments because I want to play but it was the first bye I got in about a year so cant complain.  Woot free win! Battle   Butcher  versus Harby.  I knew he was going to drop Harby and both my lists are infantry melee heavy so it would suck either way.  On top of that he had the book and the player likes to martyr a lot so I knew that would be a pain for butcher .  So I went with butcher  and hoped that I would be able to get far enough up with AD to just chill and contest with the conquest during the feat turn.  He went first and but didnt pop his feat so that was good for me.  his errants were up front and I thought that a crit devastation from the conquest would be awesome  I usually dont fish for it or shoot with him but tried it this time.  Shot his gun rolled a  and crit devastation happened.  Knocked  of them down and then I was able to charge and run all the reavers up. He doesnt like his guys dying so he would martyr himself down to  health almost every turn.  Bunch of killing happens and cant push the conquest forward because of some medium bases in the way so I kill a bunch of stuff in one turn and he is down to  health again.  I was planning to shoot harby with conquest and hope to finish her off but I had a reaver that could hit her over the wall. Could only hit her on boxcars and get it and then roll just enough on damage to kill her exactly.  I rolled the shooting from the conquest out just to see and he would have killed her too but the lucky hit worked as well.    Battle  Issyria versus Butcher .  I hadnt faced issyria yet but I thought with admonition and a couple mage hunter assassins and a strike force in there a failed attempt with butcher would end the game quickly.  First couple rounds of the game didnt go well for me needing sevens to hit the reavers with shots he missed  times in the first  rounds so I was lacking reavers going into the next rounds.  Issyria had put herself into a corner so I moved the conquest towards her with butcher shadowing it.  He was sitting right on killbox from his deployment zone and had room to move left away from the conquest when he did this he messed up however and moved issyria back a fraction of an inch so she killboxed herself not from the side but her deployment zone.  I could have possibly still won the game but it was a slim chance and this gave me the game.  Conquest charged the objective destroyed it and butcher dominated a flag and I won on scenario.   Battle   Aurora versus Butcher .  I know a lot of butcher  but he is my CoC drop with the reaver spam.  I have not come across a CoC list that works against it really even Syntherion so its an auto drop for me against CoC.  He dropped aurora because his other list was lucant and had less attacks to deal with my spam.  Get first turn and push hard up like usual.  He runs his reciprocators up and gives them set defense because he has to contest the zones somehow or will be behind.  I pop my feat and dont charge the two units of reciprocaters becaues of set defense I just walk up and attack them.  At dice minus  they sholdnt be hard to kill with a couple doom reavers thrown at all ten of them but I one shot all of them but one and kill a couple other models to get a bunch of feat tokens.  He has two units of reductors behind the reciprocaters with two foundry guys and  angel units.  I spent the feat tokens to kill the last reciprocater so he couldnt bring any back and kill a couple angels and one of the foundry units.  He kills some guys back but not enough and next turn I kill the other foundry and almost all of the reductors and then win on scenario.  For fun last turn he charged aurora into the conquest to see if she could kill him in one turn and did get him down to  boxes by herself. ,Khador,cjmfoha,2,t5_2yw9e

5625094,0,t3_3s56j2,Welcome to the Motherland Komrade!  Glad to hear youre interested in Khador!  While many players agree that ManOWar units are behind the power curve theyre still a fun easy to learn unit.  You also mentioned wanting a pt shooting and melee list.  While shooting is nice Khador is best at melee.  Of course the fun of the game comes from what you make of it.  Ill try to share a bit of what I know in hopes it helps you.To begin I am a huge fan of Iron Fang Pikemen and ManOWar Shocktroopers.  While the latter may appear to struggle in aspects particularly due to low speed and few numbers for cost I still love them.  As for Iron Fang Pikemen IFP simply put they are a phenomenal unit.  They have standard Speed and MAT.  Their weapons have reach  melee instead of . is pretty strong and they have access to Combined Melee Attack CMA.  Their DEF and ARM decent but shines under Shield Wall and adding the Black Dragon Unit Attachment UA gives you Precision Strike if you find them facing WarjacksWarbeast and Iron Zeal pushes their ARM into the stratosphere but only for one turn per game as long as the UA Leader is alive.  Drawbacks and downsides to them are that they are singlewound infantry meaning simply beating their ARM even by just  means theyre dead but you get  of them plus the Leader and a weapon less Standard Bearer if you bring the UA so casualties are acceptable and expected.Unless Im playing a theme list or a specific tactic they are ALWAYS in my army!Now for ManOWar Shocktroopers.  Firstly look awesome and are very likely the reason youre coming to Khador.  They have great MAT their weapons have reach they can also CMA and are a little stronger than the pikemen lance.  The shield they carry also has a cannon so they do have a bit of a ranged game.  Their RAT is low but not abysmal.  They have low DEF but high ARM which is kicked up to higher than most of our Jacks when under Shield Wall.  On top of all that theyre Fearless and have EIGHT HIT BOXES!So why arent they the most badass unit in the history of badassery?  Well their speed is awful much slower than the Iron Fangs.  They typically can only shoot or swing their blades during an activation not both.  They are expensive point wise.  For essentially the same cost as a full unit of IFP  UA  models for up to  attacks you can take a full unit of Shocktroopers  models for up to  attacks.  IFP are faster and will get into zones or engage the enemy long before the Shocktroopers do.  In scenario play this could be a gamedeciding factor.  Then theres the stats themselves.  Yes they have  hit boxes but unless youre in Shield Wall all the time which prevents runningcharging most attacks will dent them and if it only takes  guys from a man unit to kill  of your man unit you are going to lose the war of attrition.Still love the guys and Ive won many a game with them but their expense and limited utility compared to other units in our faction leave much to be desired from them.  There are other MoW units but I wanted to focus on them as they are the most comparable to IFP to me.  I do want to say that the MoW Demo Corps are often cited as a powerful unit due to their attack capabilities but their ARM is even lower than the STs and no CRA or Shield Wall means they will be targeted and likely die before really getting in the action.As for ranged there are  units we have that you should consider buying for sure  Widowmakers and Winter Guard Infantry.  Heres a quick break down on them.Widowmakers are an elite sniper unit.  Their RAT is high and the range of the gun is very long.  The POW of the gun is okay but they are snipers.  Specifically on a hit this unit can forego rolling damage dice and just do pt of damage automatically.  They can apply this anywhere on a WarjackWarbeast or just do pt to an enemy model.  If your opponent has singlewound infantry in range they just die.  Its great!Downside?  Only  in a unit!  Well that and they have desperately low ARM.  If they get hit by anything even clipped by an AoE they are very likely dead so please keep out of harms way.  Something that can help a little with that is the Widowmaker Marksman solo.  Adding him to the list grants them Swift Hunter.  What Swift Hunter does is allow them to move up to  after killing something which can be great for getting out of harms way after killing your opponents units.The next group Winter Guard Infantry WGI are probably these most famous unit of Khador.  They are super cheap point wise and have poor stats on their own but just add a few pieces and suddenly youve got a major threat on the battlefield!  Heres the breakdown.By themselves youve got  units with standard speed low MAT low RAT low DEF and lowtomoderate ARM.  Pretty much cannon fodder.  But their gun has decent POW moderate range and theyve got Combined Ranged Attack CRA. They can dish out a little pain but certainly cant take it.  Now lets look at how they are enhanced.First you can add up to  rocketeers to the unit at pt each.  The rockets have longer range and an AoE!  Classic fire from the rear.  Great for terrorizing your opponents.  Oh and it has take up!  If a rocketeer dies within  of another WGI they can become a rocketeer.  Definitely worth keeping around if you can.Second WGI have a UA in an officer and Standard Bearer.  Officer has the Bob and Weave order boosting DEF a bit but this is a rare case where its the Standard Bearer who brings the good stuff.  The WGI standard bearer brought a gun!  He can attack just like everyone else.  He also grants an ability called Grape Shot.  Grape Shot allows the WGI units to shoot sprays instead of single shots.  The spray is a little weaker in POW but you could potentially hit multiple opponents with it.  Its handy for clearing out clusters.And last but most certainly not least is Kovnik Joe the Winter Guard character solo.  You want him.  You need him.  He has decent stats but thats not why you get him.  You get him because hes the most patriotic badass of Khador and gives patriotic speeches to inspire Winter Guard units like the WGI to do more than they ever could alone.  He has  speeches to choose from.  You can only use one per turn but theyre supreme.  He can rouse your WGI to have boosted attack rolls excellent for boosting their low RAT to hit opponents or he can boost their Strength if for some reason you find the need to swing axe to face instead of bullets to bodies or he can inspire them to be badasses for the Motherland and grant them Fearless and Tough.  Tough means if a model is hit and would die you can make a saving throw attempt to keep them alive!  All that and this dude is cheap!  Same cost as your UA.To put it in perspective  you could go with full IFP  UA  models or go with full WGI  UA  Joe  models for the same cost.  For  more points you can add  rocketeers or up to that amount if you only have  or  pts to spare.  Thats  models with the capability of firing rockets and sprays to make out multiple models per attack.  That is HUGE and why that setup is often known as the Winter Guard Death Star.Now Ive just fed you a long wall of text. Ill come back to you with a  pt list build next time so you can digest this info.Welcome to the Motherland!,Khador,cwucha0,2,t5_2yw9e

Freerange clams dont really need focus to do work so theres no reason Andrei needs to be anywhere near it after turn one.

11157519,0,t3_5ynjog,I played her in theme the last few time I played her.Didnt bring a Warhound but I can see its point but I am not sold on it. Deff  against shooting and  against melee is often more than enough to stop oppenents from assasinating if they dont have any KD effects. When she gets killed its mostly due to said KD or effects that circumvent her Def magic bullets. Leaps etc.But while playing in Theme I really really missed Sylyss. Most importantly because I want her to do something and walking  casting Freezing Grip with Rng  is not ideal especially if you cant boost.So for me Sylys is the . buyBut I can see Reinholdt even when favouring Sylys. All his abilitys help her but I just think Sylys helps more. That said if I dont bring TorchSpriggan its always Reinholdt.,Khador,dewoyf9,2,t5_2yw9e
11202716,0,t3_5zxjt8,Theres very little reason not to run them unfortunately. With premeasuring  range is amazing and any damage boost makes them extremely powerful. Even without it they will leave dents in almost anything which at  pts a model is great.Where the kicker comes is that theyre part of units with a builtin accuracy solo and CRA so you can make some small versatile shooting units for very few points,Khador,df1talj,2,t5_2yw9e
