If you think it could be difficult just swap out your coffee with water.I gave up all caffeine and I used to drink a coke or  for breakfast  cups of green tea before lunch and some black tea in the mid afternoon.

I want to lose weight so Im limiting my fruit and nuts. I only eat fruit before fitness and nuts are a rare before bed snack if Im hankering. I think that with whole you are changing your relationship with food and part of that is not seeing fat as the enemy its been made to be. It took a long time of being paleo for me to get that. I also think that if your mom sees all the positives from you eating whole she might lay off the bacon fat gasping. Can you share positives with her have you noticed any changes? Tiger blood? Better sleep? Increased energy? Ive also read that if youre having a sweet craving that its better to eat fat or protein rather than fruit because that just fuels got cravings so to speak.

However I get so sickened from peoples reaction to others doing it. Different people have different reasons for doing a whole. Should I be ashamed that I look at my abs in the mirror and notice changes? Is that any different than a number on a scale? Its up to the individual to know that a scale number can be deceiving. Its up to the individual to make real changes in their own minds. The damage that happens to people when putting others down about weighing is far worse than the actual number itself would do to them. The goal of the whole program is to make the world more healthy. It is not a competition or game. Focus on the positives and encourage others. I personally would not compare a scale to a chocolate treat. There is a big difference between those two rules.

Greatist.com has a lot of Whole meals for breakfast lunch and dinner Nom Nom Paleo has a great thread on doing a Whole  challenge and there are recipe threads on this subreddit that are great resources for those new to the program. Just make sure you are not eating too much fruit since weight loss is your goal  while Whole  approved fruit contains a lot of sugar. Set yourself up for success and do meal prepping! A lot of people here will meal prep on Sundays and have every meal cooked or at least planned out for the whole week.
