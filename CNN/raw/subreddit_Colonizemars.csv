6430992,0,t1_czjcdey,I like your idea of a polymer balloon.And given the large number of craters on Mars one could place the polymer balloon into a suitably sized one then inflate in small steps and pile martian dirt or MarsCrete on top to nearly balance the internal pressure.  That way the balloon would only be an airtight membrane and would not have to cope with the full forces from  atmosphere of pressure.,Colonizemars,czki475,1,t5_3bh8d

8376459,0,t1_d5o60zl,Fair enough.  I first typed self sufficient then thought better of it.By using the term viability i meant a point in time and by some measure when those footing the bill decide it is worth seeing it through not pulling the pin.  If we find that everyone sent dies within  days then it is not viable.  If the amount of ongoing supply compared with population begins reducing and it can be seen that that will continue it might be seen as viable.  My home town produces very little of what it needs to survive yet it is viable.Self sufficiency to my mind also does not imply everything is made locally.  Eventually there will be things worth trading that make ongoing imports financially acceptable or perhaps acceptable by other measures.,Colonizemars,d5oluwe,2,t5_3bh8d

8743815,0,t1_d6ymhe3,Speed isnt a huge issue for travelling to Mars right now.  months or so is perfectly reasonable but at some point it would be nice if it was quicker. The idea of a cycler like this one has been around for a long time but the difference with this one is the use of ion thrusters to keep it speeding up.I am no expert on the topic but today ion thrusters are good for orbital manouvers of satellites but maybe not so good at moving a ship that size. Unless they were constantly firing?  Also shooting the energy in the form of lasers to supercapacitors wouldnt work today as we dont have useful supercapacitors. My main concern however is whether going that fast would stop the cycler from being able to cycle as it would be too fast to be captured by earth  mars gravitational well and be flung back? If that isnt an issue and the spacecraft with people and supplies dont have issues with docking a ship going so fast then it sounds like a good improvement on the standard cycler design.,Colonizemars,d6ymos8,2,t5_3bh8d
8743829,0,t1_d6ymhe3,From the little info in the article I dont even understand what the concept is supposed to be.

Let say  efficiency fuel cell  about  MJkg of fuel. tonne vehicle   tonne fuelhydrogen oxygen mix Whkm gt km range or may be better if we dump water on route equatorpole. For a route equatorpoleequator we need km range  so we have surplus and maybe we are able to haul water from the pole to a equator base. depends on real energy consumptionsIn fact we do not need  miles overlapping bases.We need only  bases or just one if  will be done for mars. I searched today and was astonished to not find the same resource prospector as it was done for the moon So we actually need water scanner bunch of remotely driven vehicles  recon base mining base energy generation base. Mining base should be in about miles proximity or km.So I would say that energy generation and living conditions are more important then proximity of water sources. It would be good to have in but if not then water source should be in few thousands km proximity.,Colonizemars,d9i9xqd,1,t5_3bh8d

9536756,0,t3_5bfr24,As said earlier Mars is a chance for a fresh start. Its our opportunity to learn lessons from life hear on earth and iterate on them in mars. The problem with iterating on them here is that everything has been built off of each other and over time so doing something like changing that way we think about government or travel infrastructure or economy would wreck other industries. On mars we can implement better systems from the beginning. So I think its really important to start with a secular humanist society on mars. We should respect the science and the process that brought us there and we should use it to recognize and humble our place in the universe. That being said spirituality is important. While the first societies on mars will most likely be more like universitylike groups studying and building the planet eventually there will be a large society of people who will all have spiritual beliefs of their own and a mars colony that has learned from their past on earth would know that we should respect religion on mars while operating a secular government. Besides life on mars will be scary. It would be good to let people have something to believe in if they choose to. ,Colonizemars,d9olr72,1,t5_3bh8d
