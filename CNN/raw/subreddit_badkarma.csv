231541,0,t1_cf4qrld,Huh.  Okay  please dont think Im picking on you  I was just confused as to why youd make that trade after seeing those reports.  It sucks to get scammed.If it makes you feel any better at all this asshat isnt allowed to post in any community that uses SteamBot due to that scammer tag on SR.Additionally having his reddit name listed here even though he can simply make a new one means hed likely have to delete this one.  So hopefully someone is saved by your report.Best of luck to you in the future  ,badkarma,cf4qwyv,2,t5_2rmrl

6540161,0,t1_cwqhz6f,How did your trade go? I just found this a day after making a trade with him for the white stm as well. Luckily was a shitty tfv with no coils i had gotten as extra in trade. Says it has departed PO as of  but as of early  no other activity on usps.,badkarma,czvt0qc,1,t5_2rmrl
6902557,0,t3_4a9x64,This is why I have a hard time trusting online tradessales. Ive been tempted to try it but I think Ill stick with local deals. Sorry you got shafted OP can you legally do anything about it? ,badkarma,d0yq249,1,t5_2rmrl
7704805,0,t1_d3hsf93,Im not home right now his steam is pizza delivery boy. I can post screenshots when i get home. ,badkarma,d3hzgzk,1,t5_2rmrl
9721422,0,t1_dab86nc,Yeah you are right seems like a victim.. The satellite custom URL he links to was for the same steamid at the time gone now.. Maybe try contacting him on steamreddit and ask for a screenshot of who gave him that link. If he has a PM from arto guy with that custom url it would be pretty solid..And thanks the tool is brand new so no wonder you didnt know  Planning to add other stuff like looking up rbadkarma and the universal scammer list for all the involved authors..,badkarma,dabdl34,3,t5_2rmrl

11416277,0,t1_dfm69fo,Dont you ever say that again man thats stupid. Try to play some pokemon go and find a friends here in reddit to play together. I am sorry to hear your case though. You should be very careful to trade here in reddit. I usually doing trade in rindiegameswap with reputable trader.,badkarma,dfq0ux1,1,t5_2rmrl
