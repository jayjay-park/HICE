1749951,0,t3_2ei6kl,Well the first thing to mention is that MLS is a single entity league so the league owns all its teams and franchises them out to partowners. So to be promoted the current iteration of the team would cease to exist and what is likely to be an identical entity with a new logo would be created that would be owned by MLS. So thats on the business side.On the squad side of things most likely we will need a lot of new players. Our first squad put up a fight against a depleted Sporting Kansas City side in the US Open Cup this year but I doubt wed do as well against stronger teams week in and week out. Maybe folks like Ibarra Ramirez Mendes Tiago and a few others are good enough to start in MLS but the entire squad as it stands right now wouldnt do well there.

I believe for all of us as we stood by and watched the team walk onto the pitch often unsure if we would see them ever return we would have identified the terms of fandom as a far simpler list. Pure existence really. Thats the only requirement that comes to my mind. But to your other point are we responsible for United being in MLS? Yes. I personally believe you are correct. And as I talked to SJE and RSL fans this weekend at the match in San Jose it was astounding to see that even these fans thousands of miles away know our story and know that circumstance to be true.And yet Im thinking now so what? Do we need to be hugged and caressed by Don Garber for that to be valid? Or is simply the gift of having a team and now for that team to play at the very highest levels they can possible achieve enough to make us see our situation for the pure unquestionable gift that it is?

3742027,0,t1_cqi0d6e,The broader question is a fair one but I dont think its one Pablo alone bears...it feels like youre mining for a scapegoat. Our gameplan when he was out there in  was to hoof it long to him hope he could win it in the air then try to build an attack from the second ball. It was ugly and not as effective as last season but I find it hard to blame Pablo for the fact he became everyones first option especially when he scored or assisted on almost half G A of the  goals we scored that season.,minnesotaunited,cqitdg6,3,t5_2wjn5
3743643,0,t1_cqizj5c,st thank you for asking. The more people can fully understand the better conversations we can have. This point frustrates me to no end with the media always ONLY using the term tax exemptions which means no collection of taxes. In MNUFCs release their second point asked for property tax exemptionrelief. What they are looking for in relief is a reduction of what they would pay at market value.This ties in with their third point. With this in mind they are basically asking for a price lock on the property tax. What I believe will happen is the property tax that is collected currently that rate will be locked in for the life of the stadium  years. That way the city isnt losing any money that they currently collect while United protects themselves from any future property tax hikes on entertainmentsporting land properties.,minnesotaunited,cqj00l1,6,t5_2wjn5

3766784,0,t1_cqlfwe1,So Ill actually engage with you instead of going entirely off topic.I agree with you and I agree with Mayor Hodges. So much of the criticism here has focused on how she isnt a real fan and how its not fair that all these others got public money rather than considering the arguments for public involvement. If there is no political will in the city for stadium improvements we need to consider why that may be. Perhaps it is because they city is taking on tons of debt for the Vikings stadium a stadium that a majority of the current council would vote against I am quite confident to say and they simply cant have the stress on city coffers of this valuable piece of land not paying property taxes. Its certainly not that they hate soccer and think it a lesser sport.I also think the most salient point is that the ownership group can likely afford to swallow the difference and pay the property taxes.Finally and somewhat tangentially  I continue to be frustrated by the team utterly failing to provide specific details around their proposal. Give the politicians and the public specific numbers of public support being requested and from what source you are asking it of. Give us plans for the area around the field beyond devlopment.,minnesotaunited,cqln3v3,4,t5_2wjn5

They bought their pair shortly after they were first released early October? I bought mine on Halloween and have used them basically every day since so take that sort of usage into account. I will say that I dont know if its just the silver colouring wearing off or if their gloves are losing the ability to work on touchscreens as well and theyre not here for me to ask so.Fit wise it depends on how large their hands are. They seem a bit loose on me I have what would be considered somewhat large hands for an average adult female but a bit on the small side for an average adult male but they in no way slide off.

I didnt see anything from Bernardo that makes me hope he sticks around past his loan.. Amazing how much better the team looked with Laing on the field. Starting to dread the Copa Centennario already.. Hes better than at least  MLS keepers right now. Id rather have him over another  purely off of how young he is. Great find by the org. . Id still like to see Tiago and Kallman start week one with Lowe coming off the bench and possibly taking over for Calvano when he needs rest. . The biggest shame about them being hurt is that we have no idea who could play RW on the proposed . Jamie looked great against Vancouver but he still looks to have lost a step from last year.

Why have two cityowned stadiums that are losing money when you already have one?Some people around here seem to have this idea that everything Mayor Hodges has done on the stadium issue is totally hypocritical and doesnt make sense. But the reality is shes been really consistent on stadiums. Also lets be happy St. Paul is running with their stadium plans and is committed to their success in a big way. This would have been harder to achieve for Minneapolis because of a more divided council and genuine concerns about the amount of money going into sports stadiums.Lastly on the Target Center specifically the city owns the building and already had commitments from the team and arena operat in an agreement in place  that had been worked on stretching back from the Rybak years it was a part of the Vikings stadium deal if you remember something Hodges opposed at the time as well.

7321275,0,t1_d2ac55g,True enough.  I naturally think back to that Northern Pitch article from February about the facilities upgrade.  There they mentioned that MNUFCs DA teams would most likely play their home games at NSC.  This could have been bad info or may have changed in the meantime.  But if sound it again makes me think that SSM will not be the only DA presence MNUFC has.  This wouldnt be unprecedented either.  I believe Colorado has DA teams in both Colorado and the Carolinas.  Not to mention that Real Salt Lake is building a huge facility that will house Academy activities.  Will this be in addition to what they have in Casa Grande AZ or in place of it.  The strangenew thing with this is it would be two DA program in the same geographic area for one MLS team.  However like I said before the nature of SSM is that it would allow MNUFC to reach into other areas and bring kids into its program.  Kinda like what Sporting KC is doing with its affiliate network but on an even better level IMO.,minnesotaunited,d2admzv,1,t5_2wjn5

7370315,0,t1_d2ffwwr,I dont think so since that already has a suspension with it. By the NASL rules I think Lowe has a one game suspension and one yellow accumulated A player will be suspended forone game upon receiving afifth accumulated yellow card throughout the Spring or Fall Seasons  regardless of the nature of the infraction. After a playerhas been suspended for five yellow cards an additional onegame suspension will be added each time after another three yellow cards are accumulated. A player receiving two yellow cards in the same game will receive a red card and willbe suspended for the next game. However that will only count as one red card and not two yellow cards added to the accumulation total. A player that receives a direct red card will automatically be suspended for the next game and the NASL Disciplinary Committee has the power to suspend him for additional games depending upon the severity of the redcard offense.,minnesotaunited,d2fyclh,1,t5_2wjn5

7793492,0,t3_4m2npb,Dayton says he wont sign the tax bill unless lawmakers fix a serious error relating to bingo halls.The error according to Daytons budget office is a single word and instead of or. In a change to the tax charged on paper pull tabs in bingo halls the tax bill defines a bingo hall as a place where an organization regularly conducts bingo if that organization gets more than half its revenue from bingo or no other organization conducts lawful gambling.If the word or was and then bingo hall would include only locations where bingo is the primary lawful gambling activity MMB wrote in a letter to Dayton dated June . But by using or most locations that sell pull tabs are or can become a bingo hall simply by regularly conducting bingo even if their bingo revenues are a small fraction of their overall lawful gambling revenues.That change MMB calculates would cost about  million over the next three years. That would force the state to impose a  percent tax on stadium suite rentals to cover the shortfall in the stadium fund the pulltab tax currently fills.,minnesotaunited,d3s1oti,6,t5_2wjn5

You need minority turnout to grow the game here which is a great mission to have.Soccer feels unique in the U.S. much different than other major sports.  Hardcore fans of all sports care about growth but a larger percentage of soccer fans discuss growth than any other group I have come across.I would love a strong Somali Hmong and Hispanic presence at the new stadium I think the landscape of MSP is changing quickly and soccer is the language we all speak.  MLS will become popular here and with proper strategy will rival the other big four nationwide.

11323538,0,t3_61iekp,Ibson does a good job of distributing the ball from the back but there is nobody that fills the  role to do the same thing in the attacking half. Ramirez is a pure targetman who always is pushing forward so there needs to always be someone playing as the SSCAM in the hole behind him. That is where Venegas usually is and yesterday nobody filled that role. We also need another CM who can win balls and control possession in the middle third of the pitch. Saied is just not good and Schuller has been uninspiring. A DP signing in the midfield would be a huge boost but I also think Molino could have a bigger role if he was moved inside where he did well in Orlando before Kaka came in. Another issue is all of our fullbacks are very good at moving forward but are not the most solid in defense. I think using the man backline where we have wingbacks instead of fullbacks was a great move. Let Thiesson and Kevin get up the field and have a rd CB to add strength in the middle. Some people dont think Davis can play CB but I think he would be perfect as an outside CB in a man line think of it as LB in a man line. Or just sign a new CB since we need more depth there anyway.I would go with a  or  whichever you preferRamirez   Venegas SSMolino CAMThiesson LWB  Ibson CM  WarnerSchuller CM  Venegas RWBDavis LCB  Calvo  CB  Kallman RCBHaving Molino and Venegas in more central floating attacking roles would give them freedom to move around. Having a triangle of those three with Thiesson and Venegas supporting on the wings and Ibson distributing behind them would be our best attacking option and having  centerbacks would give some much needed strength in the middle. Davis and Kallman both can cover a lot of ground and tackle really well. Ideally also add a DP CB and CM to replace Davis and WarnerSchuller. ,minnesotaunited,dffi60l,5,t5_2wjn5

11455087,0,t3_63gvo1,Here is my take. MLS is not that good of a league. Defenders are average and not very fast. Teams with stronger midfielders will dominate most of the time.Having a bad defense opens you up to a lot because they cant control the line and win balls so the midfielders can press.A well shaped good defending team will finish at the middle of the table.In the first game at home I think you can blame preparation and snow strategy. This last home game showed MNUFCs inability to play on artificial turf for the first third of the match and then they used Ramirez to break down the defense. When Ibson had good balls RSL struggled. When the midfielders made mistakes the pressure was on the Loons defense.Team shape comes down to time together. Ramirez will score. You have to be better on artificial turf than your opponent if you want to win more than half of your home matches.If we get decent keeper play effectively use the trap and control the ball on the artificial turf I think  of the time we win at home.  Man artificial turf is ugly soccer though cant wait until the natural pitch at home!,minnesotaunited,dfufc9d,6,t5_2wjn5

If they were asking my opinion Id rather take one well thoughtout article with realistic options that takes two weeks to put out rather than  daydreaming articles in the same amount of time.Maybe theres not a lot of obvious free agent choices in the summer transfer or end of MLS season that fit our needs. That would mean youd have to write an article that considers trades and besides allocation money I dont think we have a lot to offer  I can see that being a tough article to write. I also dont follow international contracts closely and Im not sure how easy that is for a writer to track down for determining international options.Haha the hypothetical article would also likely have to consider how wed free up an international spot there was the Demidov article....I guess the more I think about it in my head the tougher this article sounds!
