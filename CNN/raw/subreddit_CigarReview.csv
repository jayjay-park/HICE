4675352,0,t3_3ezjy0,Prelight Smoked with  days of humidor time and a straight cut.  Presents with a smooth dark chocolatecolored wrapper with gold highlights.  The cold draw tasted of cinnamon.  Paired well with Bells Porter.  Imgur album First third Right off the bat this gave some refined but very intense flavors of damp earth and tobacco underscored by dark chocolate.  The cinnamon quality from the cold draw carried over onto the nose.  This constituted a deep dark flavor profile akin to a Drew Estate Liga Privada No. . The burn was razorsharp though the ash was a tad flaky at the tip.  Ash held on for about . inches at a time and the foot smoke never stopped.Second third The damp earth took a step back in this third but a woody black pepper with mediumintensity spice stepped in.  The chocolate stuck around and became a bit more intense.  The construction is still great.Final third The black pepper was the star of the final third backed by toasted oak that branched out from the black pepper flavor.  The chocolate came and went.  One small wrapper defect began to split as the burn line approached but it was easily cauterized by a quick burst of flame.  I believe this was a storageinduced defect.  I set it down with about . inches remaining.Verdict If you like the Liga No.  give this baby Liga a shot.  Even if you dont at ca.  a piece you cant go wrong.  It might require some patience to get there though the  months of humidor time probably had something to do with this sticks stellar performance.  I will rate this very goodtoexcellent .,CigarReview,ctjvmoj,1,t5_38ogg

If Im in a BampM or if I have to add a single or a couple of singles to an order to put it over some amount to get a discount or free shipping or something Ill usually add a Padron because a I like the cigars and b I know theyre price fixed and theyre not charging me extra because its a BampM or a single on a website.,CigarReview,cvl90du,1,t5_38ogg
