11146435,0,t1_dev8awx,I think its unanimous among the team that were open to and love to see well thought out thorough ideas like this one. We may very well take the majority of suggestions from them and implement them after being balanced to where they fit but you shouldnt expect to see them copypasted as chances are its not so easy to understand how the ideas will actually play out in the actual game environment.  ,DarzasDominion,devfq5k,3,t5_3ibos

11689661,0,t3_66so9j,Juix had pushed it to the app store about a week ago. However it was rejected by Apple because of a crash that occurred when playing. Juix fixed this issue and has put this version up for approval. It is now just a waiting game to see when Apple will finally approve it. There is no real telling how long this will take. It just depends on how many apps are up for approval at the time. Should be at max a couple days.,DarzasDominion,dgl1hif,1,t5_3ibos
