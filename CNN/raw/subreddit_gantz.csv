9703692,0,t3_5dw13g,Given Im a part of ShocWave let me answer some things... uplsrekt is incorrect. It was not cancelled. It HAS however been put on a temporary hiatus. We all have real lives now and arent as free as we once were doing the original series or the anime DVDs for that matter. We ask you to be patient and hopefully by weekend well have  out. Yes for English ShocWave is the ONLY group doing it. If there were more competition maybe wed be more motivated.  The MAIN issue for the delay is that ch has lots of sound effects and text moreso than usual. Chapter  has already been scanned and is in the translation and editing phase.,gantz,da96s3i,5,t5_2rtbn

10123015,0,t1_dbr10ep,Would have loved that rather than the white knight he became. Saving her she likes him but only as a friend and he says whatever stays with Tae but she changes her mind he dumps Tae and she decides not to because it would mess up their fights. Could see some awesome scenes of anger and him high fiving Osaka team for having sex with the aliens. Then Tae dies... Is brought into Gantz. I can dream cant I?,gantz,dbr1afm,1,t5_2rtbn

10943277,0,t3_5vr2vb,Ive watched plenty of anime but this movie has some of the worst dialog. Even the subtitle text is different that what was spoken on screen. I petition for a rewrite of the dialog.,gantz,de8pztf,1,t5_2rtbn
10952045,0,t3_5wf7aa,My recommendation is to watch the anime version and stop after the budha mission.After that read the manga. The manga has more content of the previos mission but its not too much. Besides watching the anime you can hear the opening that is insane and the good morning song when a mission starts.,gantz,de9mj8u,4,t5_2rtbn
