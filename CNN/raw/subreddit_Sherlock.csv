14587,0,t1_cefvfd2,Personally i like to think Sherlock went up the roof with a plan to extract the signal of some sort to pull off the snipers. When Moriarty kills himself he is put into check mate. I like to think Sherlock walked onto the ledge and estimated the likelihood of fatality. Probably above . He calculates how he should land to minimise fatal injuries. I like to think he jumped knowing he would most likely die anyways. He is then resuscitated by pure chance.The significance of this is pretty great and the reveal would be quite surprising.

As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed manwho had been behind me and I knocked down several books which he wascarrying. I remember that as I picked them up I observed the titleof one of them THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP and it struck me that thefellow must be some poor bibliophile who either as a trade or as ahobby was a collector of obscure volumes the old man visits Watson and reveals himself Youre surprised to see me sir said he in a strange croakingvoice.I acknowledged that I was.Well Ive a conscience sir and when I chanced to see you go intothis house as I came hobbling after you I thought to myself Ill juststep in and see that kind gentleman and tell him that if I was a bitgruff in my manner there was not any harm meant and that I am muchobliged to him for picking up my books.You make too much of a trifle said I. May I ask how you knew who Iwas?Well sir if it isnt too great a liberty I am a neighbour of yoursfor youll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Streetand very happy to see you I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself sir.Heres BRITISH BIRDS and CATULLUS and THE HOLY WARa bargain everyone of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on thatsecond shelf. It looks untidy does it not sir?I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned againSherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I roseto my feet stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement and thenit appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last timein my life. Certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes and when itcleared I found my collarends undone and the tingling aftertaste ofbrandy upon my lips.

Shes again intelligent and quick witted realistic and sober minded confident and curious all for the average standard ... and a bloody nice actor to boot. And Irish.  Sherlocks sociopathy however much of it he may bear we already know its not complete. Its clear that he cares for Hamish more so than just in reciprocity and has proven that hes capable of chemical romantic and irrational affection with the case of the Woman who whilst his intellectual inferior still fell in his rare most favor.He is going to need an assistant and its clear that the producers are toying with us constantly with Molly but in their case probability of a romantic relationship are... dubious at best.But then again unless theyd be to bump into one another again on account of Mary theres no way theyd meet again.So its most likely the Woman as thankfully Sherlock doesnt have to go by the canon.,Sherlock,cek76uy,14,t5_2ryt0

87090,0,t1_ceobtjo,Yes it can be explained in the story but literally anything can be. The point is giving power to the events of the story by not undermining them unless there is good reason. As an example is the roof scene with Moriarty really that important anymore now that we know everyone survived and we are likely going to be going though the whole thing again? That entire ending is much less powerful for me. But that is fine because Moriarty is back that scene is still a very good scene and now we have the potential for more like it. But not so with this ending. Dont take this as me not being happy Moriarty is back I amThe reason why Sherlock killed him was because he had no other choice. The only way to save everybody was to sacrifice himself and it was clearly portrayed as a sacrifice and now he is in big trouble. Now if there is no sacrifice in that move it is less powerful. It is just well why didnt I do that from the start? The going to eastern Europe to die was a good sacrifice but with him coming back I dont see what they could do that wont undermine the significance of his choice.,Sherlock,ceoceht,4,t5_2ryt0

He also casually mentioned that there must have been something in the punch just moments before passing out due to said punch. Doesnt that all strike you as odd?Mycroft constantly points out that hes smarter than Sherlock.

Oh thats a bit to fangirl.... Could be explained most reasonably as a family heirloom passed from father to eldest son at a certain point in their life.

The Mary Sueing of Mary Watson was awful though admittedly I dont remember Mary Watson in the books.

261130,0,t1_cf7oib2,And you seem to be down rating post when you cant prove your point. I have proven my point. Also in the canon theres more than one Moriarty Professor and Colonel. So it is not introducing a new character. I pointed everyone in the direction of an excellent blog that goes more into depth. I do not understand the hostility particularly when you havent added to the dialogue.From the blogThe basic elements of the Moriarty as Woman theory include The Killer Cabbie never referring to Moriarty by gender neither he nor she. The softness of the voice of the Moriarty who spoke to the old woman blown up in The Great Game. The first words Moriarty speaks to Sherlock through the first hostage in The Great Game Hello Sexy. The continuing seductive and intimate language throughout. The clues in the name Janus cars.  The mythological God Janus has two faces often characterized as male and female.  The envelope for Sherlock with the pink phone that we see early in The Great Game was addressed by a woman using a fountain pen a Parker Duofold with an iridium nib according to Sherlock.But please go ahead and demand that the most relevant clue is Jims gay underwear.,Sherlock,cf7tpsj,-1,t5_2ryt0

1357215,0,t3_29m8pa,. Jim Moriarty Nothing needs to be said. Pure unfiltered brilliance. Both in the writing and acting.. Irene Adler I love her chemistry with Sherlock. Shes the type that bounces around between villain and antihero. Its amazing to watch. The way she plays Sherlock is something else too.. Jeff Hope AKA the Cab Driver. Hes brilliant. I love his bit about how he hasnt killed anyone hes just outlived them. Just a hair better than CAM but theyre both great.. CAM A great villain to be sure. I just found him to be a little too creepy for my tastes. I get that thats the point. Between licking people and peeing in fireplaces it was just too much. But it was supposed to be. He also seemed to be a bit of a letdown in the grand scheme department. Its only my tastes but I just love a good old fashioned villain.. The Mayfly Man he seemed to me like the most real villain if that makes sense. His hatred of Maj. Sholto was very understandable. Good compelling mystery and inventive murder method too.. Lord Moran Honestly his whole plot was just a MacGuffin to get Sherlock and John back together again. It was cool but the nonterrorist centered parts of the episode were the ones I liked more. . Bob Frankland Bit of a noncharacter really. Mad scientist trope worked pretty well and I liked his death in the minefield. Other than that not much to say about him.. The Asian Gang Just a mediocre villain for a middling episode. Another strand in Moriartys web for Sherlock to catch. Not very interesting to be honest.,Sherlock,cimf15r,6,t5_2ryt0

1744286,0,t1_cjz0t5l,Id say Elementary is more than above average.  Sure it generally runs on your typical American format of more or less independent episodes but where there are arcs are longer stories it does them extremely well with plenty of twists and turns and surprises.It does a great job of changing up the stories and characters too so it feels fresher and newer looking at Mycroft and Moriarty especially.It also deals with addictions dependance isolation social awkwardness etc brilliantly.  It was these aspects that are explored that really hooked me on the show.  The character of Sherlock depicted in Elementary is so much more interesting than in Sherlock.  Sure Cumberbatchs Sherlock is a genius and a bit social inept but he is the hero and always comes off as such.  Millers Sherlock has way more layers to him and the show is much more about his struggles past present and future than it is about him solving crime.  The crimes are usually quite dull and boring and as Ive noted here before Sherlock doesnt do much out of the ordinary that a normal police officer couldnt figure out once presented with all the evidence and given some time to think about it but its everything else that comes along with the show that makes it such a joy to watch.,Sherlock,cjz11kr,15,t5_2ryt0
1748739,0,t1_cjz3m2b,I agree with the main paragraph. On mollys blog she always refers to Sherlock as you know who or something like that until one slip up where she says his name. Then Jim from IT comments asking her for coffee. Jim knows she likes him and sees him so he uses that as an in. In that scene you can see where Jim realizes his mistake. When John speaks for Sherlock Jim gives him a look like oh youre the one i need few days later its john in semtex not molly. I think Molly is a minor character and not a very good one honestly and not involved in any major Moriarty plot,Sherlock,cjzl6bz,5,t5_2ryt0

2477685,0,t3_2njzug,Not impossible and certainly not improbableDid anyone watch the interview with B.C. on PBS NewsHour here  ?Around  Benedict says in response to the interviewers question of whether it is fun shaking up the story thinking of others portrayals of Sherlock Holmes he replies Yeah of course it is. And were doing that even within the rules of our own project I guess. Its a form of slasher fiction by two of the biggest fanboys ever of the Conan Doyle originals and we have paid great homage  to that....It would stand on shaky ground if it werent the foundations of the book and yet we can start to evolve that idea now a little bit which is gonna be exciting. Notice the clip they chose to show for this bit. I was thrilled by this! I LOVE the subtext of Sherlock. The tension is great and what makes the show fun and emotionally intriguing. It got me at hello.  Do I want to see the tension resolved? Not fully but I would love more something....How to do it is the question. It is intoxicating. More please.As for the gay or not issue I dont like that question as it puts forth complicated issues of identity. It makes black and white what is not. You dont have to identify as gay to fall in love with someone of the same gender. You may not be able to draw the line between friendship and romantic love. You can be asexual but still fall in love. You might identify as straight but fall in love with someone of the same gender. Society calls this gay but while for some this is liberating for others not so much because we are so defined by how other see us or what we perceive gay to be. And I think this is what the show points out that in our times we cant see past gay or straightwe want to pigeonhole people. But at the same time I LOVE that the show normalizes samesex relationships.So I agree with not further pushing the Im not gay thing because it compartmentalizes the bond between Sherlock and John.  Even if John is essentially straight nothing precludes him from loving Sherlock specifically. So I love all the couple comments and all the references to them as necessary for each other.So for me the bond between Sherlock and John is the essential part. I would love at the very least a kiss. I dont know how a romance would play out on screen but I am not theoretically opposed in any way except I dont want to lose the delicious tension.Disclaimer I am a lesbian myself and I researchteach literature gender and sexuality at university. Questions of platonic friendship vs. romantic friendshipmove vs. purely erotic relationships fascinate me.  And I ship Johnlock hard.,Sherlock,cmhyyit,2,t5_2ryt0

4602395,0,t1_ctabfhi,I dont know which sites you visit regularly I just know avoiding spoilers works just fine for me. Now that you mention it I realize that everyone will have a different experience based on the media they consume.For me it is pretty easy. I dont use social media like Facebook twitter instagramm and co I just use reddit which I wouldnt call a social media but that doesnt matter. I get my news from sites that focus only on politics and economy and have nothing to do with pop culure sometimes I check sites who specialize on pop culture to find out about new shows but I avoid them when I am not up to date with a popular show  I check epguides for new episodes of the shows I watch and youtube for my subscribed channels. And then there are many other sites that are specialized in one thing like telling me when my bustrain is departing or email service or research portals and other unentertaining stuff like that. So for me avoiding spoilers is pretty easy I managed to let  seasons of Game of Thrones  pass until I started watching without having anything spoiled welll i saw somne pics on reddit but without any context they made so little sense to me that I just instantly forgot them But that doesnt work for everyone of course.But I think the most important thing here is we are not talking about spoiling stuff on facebook or in a newspaper we are talking about spoilers in a subreddit which is specialized in one show. And I think such a subreddit is somewhat equal to a book discussion club. You go there to discuss the full thing and not to shush everyone else because you just finished chapter one. If you arent caught up unsubscribe the subreddit until you have. ,Sherlock,ctapwxo,2,t5_2ryt0
4676548,0,t1_ctjw3ti,Thank you so much  I thought so too but apparently not which makes me really really happy.I have to give credit to Loudest Subtext in Television here  she made me realize so many things that Ive missed like who is probably M his role in the story etc. Whats interesting is that if shes right then johnlock is inseparable from the main story in fact many things that may not seem connected happened because of it.I think so! Even when Ive just watched Sherlock for the first time and didnt think about subtext and stuff too much Ive thought that he wanted to tell John how he feels since thats the last time they see each other and there is nothing to lose anymore. Since then Ive thought about it a lot and... I think that Mycrofts reaction is perhaps the biggest hint that Sherlock wanted to do just that also he didnt need a private moment just to tell him a joke haha  since the very beginning we know that Mycroft thinks that Sherlock is gay that comment in ASiP about a happy announcement as well as being sure that Irene Adler wont work on him and hes both very perceptive as well as someone with access to information on just anybody so its safe to assume that he has a good idea about Johns situation as well. Besides hes seen them together for all those years hes seen how they talk about each other how they look at each other... he knows whats between them. And he knows that Sherlock doesnt care about privacy at all both when it comes to other people borrowing Johns notebook reading his emails reading his birth certificate...  as well as his own when John tells him that hes had problems with his card when shopping Sherlock immediately gives him his own and doesnt care about it at all also Mycroft tells us that Sherlock doesnt close the door to his bedroom etc.. So when Sherlock asks Mycroft to give him and John a moment Mycrofts expression really says it all  hes genuinely surprised because he knows exactly what that means. He knows that this means that Sherlock has finally figured out his feelings for John as well as managed to find courage to tell him... So why doesnt Sherlock tell John at the end? IMHO its because when they start talking about Johns baby and that its a girl you can see that Sherlocks reaction to the news is quite emotional as well he realizes that there is no point in telling him now  they wouldnt be together anyway it was supposed to be the last moment they see each other and Sherlock would just mess up Johns already complicated situation with Mary who despite everything is still the mother of Johns child. So despite wanting to tell him more than anything he finds the strength not to tell him just to protect him... After all this episode has really shown just how far Sherlocks willing to go to protect John.Mycrofts going to be one proud big brother...,Sherlock,ctk10zo,2,t5_2ryt0

5174104,0,t1_cv9lxfb,That was just really poor wording on my part. I do have some friends who stopped watching Sherlock because they would forget things from one season to the next and end up not understanding something in the latest season. Not an issue for me since I rewatch the show but many of my friends dont want to or dont have the time to rewatch it. I do think Sherlock is one of the easier shows to rewatch though since it is only  episodes a season.I am also a voracious reader and I have to disagree at least partly with your argument that novelists take a long time to publish between books. Really depends on the author as well as the genre. Some of my favorite authors publishpublished new books yearly Dick Francis Felix Francis Jonathan Kellerman Lawrence Block Ed McBain. One in particular would publish two or three times a year Robert B. Parker and others for the most part published something almost every year P.N. Elrod Terry Pratchett Harlan Ellison Ted Wood. And yes some authors do wait years in between books Tad Williams Storm Constantine and some will publish yearly for awhile and then take an extended break before getting back to a fairly regular publication schedule Neil Gaiman. I notice the longest wait is usually for graphic novelists or playwrights although Tom Stoppard up until recently would publish a play almost every year. Then there is Nora Roberts who is basically a writing machine cranking out novels and novellas numerous times a year. Oh so many books to read and so little time. I suppose that is one good thing about the wait between Sherlock seasons I have a lot of time to get in a lot of reading. ,Sherlock,cv9o4a2,2,t5_2ryt0

I didnt realised how it just completely machetes the whole episode and it results with the plot being Sherlock drug trips into Sherlock who drug trips into Sherlock who further trips into  again and then into the Reichenbach Falls scene with Moriarty.

We dont really know that much about Moriarty so while the code thing is stupid it at least doesnt bend the shows established rules quite as badly. Plus Moriarty tells us exactly why he would expect Sherlock to fall for it its complicated and dramatic. If the Holmes brothers have spent several months misleading Moriarty again thats only a theory into believing Sherlock has a blind spot when it comes to puzzles and drama it makes sense that Moriarty would bank on that blind spot. Its not that he thinks Sherlock is dumb enough to fall for it  he thinks he can successfully distract Sherlock from how dumb the code is by making it dramatic and hard to figure out.Like I said I think the entire code thing is pretty stupid  but this particular theory at least makes it a little less ridiculous. ,Sherlock,db7ubt8,1,t5_2ryt0

10013091,0,t1_dbcaujy,Excellent! Im not really adding anything new this time just expanding on a couple of them a bit. The disgust that Sherlock feels towards CAM is also in The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton. Lots of references of course to the story but for someone reason the absolute hatred Sherlock has for blackmailers and CAM really sticks out to me. Moriarty is the Napoleon of crime The Final Problem and CAM is the king of all the blackmailers The Adventure of CAM. In the show Sherlock refers to CAM as the Napoleon of blackmail.gtHum! Hes about due. Do you feel a creeping shrinking sensation gtWatson when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo and see gtthe slithery gliding venomous creatures with their deadly eyes gtand wicked flattened faces? Well thats how Milverton impresses gtme. Ive had to do with fifty murderers in my career but the worst gtof them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. gtAnd yet I cant get out of doing business with himindeed he is gthere at my invitation. Sherlock talking about his flair for the dramatic when he puts Marys pic on the building is from The Adventure of the Naval Treaty and The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone. Kate Whitney is a character from The Man with the Twisted Lip. She awakens the Watsons in order to get help for her husband Isa Whitney who was at an opium den. And in finding Isa Whitney Watson runs into Sherlock.gt As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden gtpluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered Walk past me and gtthen look back at me. The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. gtI glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at gtmy side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very gtwrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from gtbetween his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude gtfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took gtall my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of gtastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him gtbut I.

10051913,0,t1_dbhqizf,But you seem to be arguing from the pointofview that what Marys done isnt forgivable despite whats been shown so clearly you have some point of comparison for her actions. If we as an audience are shown that both John and Sherlock forgive her through their words and actions is that not proof enough of their forgiveness?From the same transcript you sourced above this is what Mary says right before she shoots Sherlockgt MARY her voice a little tearful Im sorry Sherlock. Truly am.Sherlock explains why Mary was cornered into shooting him in the episode she had to shoot to protect John. And Mary likes Sherlock as she says in the first episode even before John has forgiven him  so why would she want to shoot him unless it was a desperate situation? Unless her hand was forced? Even if you dont buy the explanation well its straight from Sherlocks mouth.And in return for her shooting him Sherlock reveals her past to John. Im sure it was a painful situation for them all because nobody wins right then. Not Mary not Sherlock not John.gt The only thing weve got to judge her by is that she loves John wants to keep him and will do anything to keep it that way. Thats a very selfish kind of love in stark contrast to the selfsacrifice Sherlock made for his friends.We also see that she cares for her neighbours encourages John to spend time with Sherlock will do anything to protect her family and is devastatingly capable of many things. Most of all Sherlock likes her. Weve got lots to judge her on though we have the disadvantage of having known her only for four episodes.Maybe her love seems selfish but maybe that stems from having had to run from her past. But like you noted we dont have enough backstory to judge her on that. However Marys love for John and Sherlocks love for his friends dont stand in such a stark contrast for me. Mary sacrifices her desire for a normal life with John to protect him by shooting Sherlock nonfatally she opens the door to what she believes is her demise. Does that not count as a form of selfsacrifice from her pointofview?,Sherlock,dbhsfv8,3,t5_2ryt0

In fact seeing how Mary should have gotten killed and she only lived by accident just like him that would point to an English Woman that was not there getting exploded! He had absolutely no way of knowing how many people knew about the mission!  As Mary pointed out they were getting orders from a VOICE ON THE PHONE WHICH JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE AN ENGLISH WOMAN. For all he knew thirty other people on that end of the phone knew everything. The most obvious would be the people employing them. Governments are famous for using disposable mercenaries. If something goes wrong rather then be embarrassed they just disavow them and let them get killed.

10259735,0,t1_dc6ai9v,I agree with you I felt a little like the character of Culverton and his story as a serial killer was sort of wasted and was really only used as a way to unite John and Sherlock back together again as Mary said the only way to save John is for John to save Sherlock. So Culverton was really just a case Sherlock targeted in order to reconcile and get closer to Jon once more. I mean when you reduce it down however creepy and well developed Toby Jones character was he was nothing more than a serial killer that Sherlock used to make amends with John while also being able to catch Culverton out and get a confession along the way. Culvertons case was really just a way to bring the characters back together his confession and his case being solved was just a secondary effect. ,Sherlock,dc6zwlv,3,t5_2ryt0

10330300,0,t1_dcefhfa,And this is a remarkably healthy response  the show failed to bring you pleasure so you went your merry way.For audiences to have expectations is normal and natural. Different sections of a same fandom have dissimilar interpretations and wishes as a result of it. All of that is perfectly fine ! It only has the potential to become problematic when spectators forget there is an inherent fracture line between themselves and the creators. To love a cultural entity is not to own nor is it to control it.The potential issue is not and never has been the JohnLock ship at all. There is gay subtext in Sherlock ! And if and when people like and respond to it they should enjoy themselves with it. Completely. Utterly. Unabashedly. The hypothetical problem as the Original Poster highlighted is that to some of its supporters TJLC is not a theory it is the truth and a promise Moffat and Gatiss implicitly made.But is it ? Again there is gay subtext in Sherlock. And there is straight subtext as well. Who is to say which one carries more weight in the canon but the writers ? Unfortunately we have now reached a point where some TJLCers have invested so much of themselves projected such a nonnegligeable portion of their own identity onto Sherlock that to them a validation of TJLC would not simply represent the confirmation of a fan theory but stand for a validation of them as people.I write unfortunately because no show or cultural entity no matter what its nature should be expected to carry this level of emotional and deeply personal stakes. None can ! It is just a bunch of fictional characters. While we can demand they entertain thrill amuse delight horrify bore annoy or terrorise us they cannot be asked to save us. That is too tall an order.I for one do not care whether John and Sherlock end up together as a couple. If they do it will be believable if they dont it will be believable as well. But I am almost at a point where I wish JohnLock becomes canon just because I fear for some of the TJLCers wellbeing if it does not. And this may not be OK...,Sherlock,dcezwrz,3,t5_2ryt0

When first watching TRF he was such a menacing unpredictable clever character but I cant really look back at that now and think the same he just seems like a pawn. It just feels like they ruined his character a bit  in my opinion. I suppose Im looking back at the first two seasons with rosetinted glasses but those for me were by far the best. Sherlock and John solving individual cases back in Baker Street coming to conclusions by piecing subtle clues together each episode with a bigger underlying story in the background. Mary spoke my mind at the end of SE Go and solve a case together make him wear the hat. ,Sherlock,dch3jlu,3,t5_2ryt0

10349183,0,t3_5o753e, Well Eurus did explicitly say that it was John or Mycroft that had to shoot the Governor and that if Sherlock did the deed it wouldnt count. So his suicide didnt count thats why Euros killed the Governors wife  to prove the rigour of her tests and make sure they played her game. The killing of the third brother I couldnt even guess at With the elimination round Sherlock had to kill one of the two that was the challenge punishment and reward all bundled into one. So when Sherlock threatened suicide he upset the game and forced Eurus to reset the pieces I guess she didnt see any purpose to killing Mycroft.  As to why Eurus chose not to kill him relating to her being imprisoned I dont think she cared all that much.  The only person she seemed to have any connection to her was Sherlock and breaking him seemed to be her only goal. Mycroft was just a practicality and emotional lever.,Sherlock,dch51ke,3,t5_2ryt0

Its actually really a backstory. The reason we ended with Rathbone Place is that actually if we do come back  and we would love to come back  we could absolutely very easily start with a knock at the door and Sherlock saying to John Do you want to come out and play?. ...gt Moffat said If this was the last time  were not planning it but it might be its possible  we could end it there.

Ive heard that many bisexual people have been through the exact same experience including some friends i know irl. maybe thats why its easier for queer people to pick on this when it mostly goes over our head. id say the reading of queerbaiting in sherlock is kind of like an iceberg it seems like its tiny and based on nothing but thousands of people who adore the show didnt just collectively imagine this. i think completely dismissing these things as cheap jokes and meaningless coincidences is taking the easy route at least read into it with an open mind then decide. ,Sherlock,dcie1sl,3,t5_2ryt0

Trying to figure out the puzzle yourself was always the best part of Sherlock. Sometimes you were right and then you felt rather clever sometimes wrong and even more times you got some parts right. Was it realistic? No. But the pieces were also magic and they were there. I didnt really have that big of a problem with Eurus charm it could fit in to this universe. The main issue is that a lot of this season was more classic drama where we had none or very few clues about what was going on until it was revealed.

10419230,0,t3_5p76bt,I always assumed Mycroft. Sure Sherlock has beef with him but Mycroft usually chooses to look after his little brother whether he likes it or not. Remember Sherlocks reaction when he learns that Mrs Hudson had been bringing him tea every morning?
