9142286,0,t1_d8apq0f,Personally I reckon the song is about Justins arc as he learns more about religion from in the first verse not really caring Ive heard about it sixes hang in the door what kind of shit to ignore from in the second verse learning about religion and questioning it aint that some kind of quandary whats the function or the task? Ive learned about it and the third verse is him becoming religious but finding not closure or understanding long lines of questions standing in the need of prayer and eventually giving it up no thats not how thats supposed to feel. The final lines are just him looking back on the experience fondly Ive laughed about it.Anyway thats how I interpret the song. My problem isnt really with the lyrics though the video just annoyed me because the only interesting thing it does is change colour from red to orange.,boniver,d8aumii,11,t5_2t996
