You dont have to work fast food there are high end restaurants that I would imagine pay better... Or hell start your own place...That being said since you are half way done with your degree you should be able to pivot to a different field since the first couple  years of school is basic bs that applies to any field. ,Career_Advice,cz2mi0n,1,t5_2v78q
6283589,0,t3_41hvwr,Why the burnout? I see you owned your own restaurant for . years  what happened? I would not be surprised if it failed nor should you feel that that reflects badly on you necessarily  restaurants are really tough businesses to keep going and the failure rate from what I have been told can be very high.Are you beating yourself up over this or is there another reason for your burnout?I also see that you sort of took a step back careerwise in that you are managing a fastfood place while earlier you not only ran  your own place but managed catering had been a restaurant manager etc.Before you make a decision one way or another I am curious as to what is behind the burnout  is it just a lack of interest or are other factors at play?,Career_Advice,cz3vg3j,1,t5_2v78q

7418163,0,t3_4gpq1v,Only if you are actively working with them i.e. they are considering you for a position. Otherwise if all you did was submit a resume and thats it then no I would not contact them. If they do come back to you later just say you are no longer available. If they took that long to get back to you then theyll understand. You snooze you lose! Congrats on the new job!,Career_Advice,d2leb8o,1,t5_2v78q
7571857,0,t3_4hxvs2,Youre in exactly the same position that my mom was in  years ago.  She had a BA in Sociology and was selling real estate and hated it.  Also the real estate market was bad at the time.  So at age  she received her Masters in Education.  She discovered that she didnt really like teaching but that could have been a product of her having a very bad lead teacher while she was doing her student teaching.  Instead because of her Masters she moved into counseling.  She loved it!  She counseled children for over  years and now has a great retirement plan.  Her job satisfaction was huge even though the pay was less but certainly more reliable and there are a lot of benefits to being a teacher.  Based on her experience Id say go for it.  ,Career_Advice,d32vsy8,1,t5_2v78q

Theres no reason for a desktop support person to work  days a week and overnight and shit.if their equipment needs that much maintenance its time to just replace it. ,Career_Advice,dco57dk,1,t5_2v78q

10532013,0,t3_5j42dk,Its all about location location location. I have two bas in d animation and D animation so I think I can answer that one. Cheap animation like motion graphics is done more and more by freelancers from Asian countries. Prices are going down and job is disappearing. You get pockets of work here and ere but its all about contacts. Otherwise online youll compete with people bidding half of your price. You still have a few studios of d character animation here and there but they are becoming rarer. This industry is also going down. Animation in video games is done more and more with motion capture. Cleaning mocap noises is not the most exciting thing. But some studio still use keyed out animations so it depends. Every game studios use rigs. D animation studios are a fairly healthy industry for now. Theres been a demand for animators in Canada because of the subsidies. Among them riggers are better paid and more in demand because its more a technical challenge too. Vfx is on the rise too but the working conditions are not great. They are a fixed bid industry so any pressure usually end up on the shoulders of the employees. I heard stories of a lot of OT not always paid or paid in vacations later or night shifts. To avoid if possible. If I were you Id go D animation with some rigging skills cant go wrong with that. Depend on where you live or want to live I would specialize film or game as they usually use different softwares. ,Career_Advice,dd1x4bt,1,t5_2v78q
10726173,0,t1_ddmbfx3,Thank you! Very excited for the new opportunity. My current employer will pay out accrued unused vacation time when I leave my friend just left and confirmed this was true. Ill have accrued . days for the year by the end of Feb. Not sure if theyll prorate or round but at least Ill get something. And Im planning to be prepared to be walked out if it comes to that once I put in my notice. They dont usually do that but you never know.

11445807,0,t1_dfj6gz4,Yeah that is what I was thinking. It sounds like OP is just having a problem with a bad company culture. It seems like it would just be best to find another company in the same industry that isnt as cutthroat. ,Career_Advice,dftdenf,1,t5_2v78q
11549486,0,t1_dg54tnj,What if you asked your parents to help market and they would pay you an average rate for whatever someone in marketing would get? Therefore you wouldnt be piggy backing and you could then learn both real estate and marketing and then move to a different firm so that you could earn your stripes. What are your parents planning on doing with the company after they retire? Ideally I would think theyd want to pass it down to their kids to carry it to the next generation. ,Career_Advice,dg54y66,2,t5_2v78q
