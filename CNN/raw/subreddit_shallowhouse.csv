2935102,0,t1_co1q20o,Thats a tough example since its  songs in one original  remix  edit. Have you heard the Bontan remix without the Plesaurekraft edit? The original and Bontan version are  deep house. And I just checked a few online sources which verified that. Id consider the Pleasurekraft edit to be deep house as well. Also shallow is not a genre. It was a joke by the mods. It was not intended to be a genre. Look at the mods flair in this sub. Kiddie Pool Curator and Knee deep. There are genres that already exist like in my comment to label shallow sounding music. If you need to label something as shallow then you probably dont know enough about existing genres.,shallowhouse,co1qezw,1,t5_31eda

But I should Def start layering the kick I do on most tracks but it just felt right for this one not to layer.  But when I do layer I make one low end kick n then make one higher frequency like around  do you think thats good? ,shallowhouse,cu4visc,0,t5_31eda

He has like  followers so I know he saw my question a bit selfish tbh. The least you can do is pass on the name of the artist who remixed it and support them. Edit Kinda sounds like the melody from Martin Solveigs Do it right now that you mention it actually sounds like something else more cant put my finger on it though.,shallowhouse,d8pvo9c,1,t5_31eda
