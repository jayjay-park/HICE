2513315,0,t1_cmmm7vl,gtIf a comment contains multiple figures either process all of them or none of them.Instead of deleting all decimal places I set it to round the converted value to  above decimal place above the original value example feet  . mI tried to set it to the same number of significant figures as the original value but there were many complaints about accuracy.gt If a long comment contains a bunch of different numbers it is not useful to just convert one.I am currently doing this although the limit is  conversions per comment to avoid commenting big comments.gtTry to code some basic context sensitivity for ambiguous measurements like ounces. Maybe ounces is the only one. Pounds?I thought people wrote fl oz for volume?  Not sure how to detect if it is the pounds currency or pounds weight.  I might have to stop converting pounds and keep it converting lbs only.gtMake sure the bot is aware of comments where the commenter has already included both figures. Not sure if you did this already. If I say the distance is  miles km it should not comment.Working on that the problem is that the bots conversion is usually more accurate than the users conversion so I have to check it rounding the bots conversion in many different ways.gtIs it aware of casual but commonly used measurements of height like five foot six or   weights like half an ounce etc?Currently working on things like .  It wont be able to detect  though as I believe it would lead to many false positives.  Ill add things like half an ounce later on.gtIf youre not already pay attention to what your bot is doing and consider how to fix cases where its doing the wrong thing or shouldnt be doing anything at all. For instance the example about football and yards. I dont know how you are going to manually ban it from every football related subreddit like individual teams etcIm leaving that to the moderators as I cant really ban it from all subreddits.,ToMetric,cmmmncv,1,t5_357s0
2533892,0,t3_2oj3qn,Im waiting for somebody to make a FromMetric bot just to see how far they get replying to each other before one of the authors stops their bot from replying to the other.Whoever gives in loses. ,ToMetric,cmpbe0p,2,t5_357s0
4628355,0,t3_3dwvkk,In posts where multiple instances of a measurement are listed it seems to only convert the first one. Also would it be possible to work in some of the major currency conversions? It would be nighimpossible to get them all but you could include things like dollars and euros.,ToMetric,ctdz4m9,1,t5_357s0
