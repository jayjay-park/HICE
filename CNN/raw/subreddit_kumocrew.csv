In the process we sadly got caught up in a fight with Empirealigned CMDRs who were also terrorizing your systems...you can thank us for taking care of them at another time. For now you can freely access Gabriel Interprise without shitting your pants at the sight of another CMDR.Safe travels..... on your way to mess with Hudson  so us with Pranav Antal can be left alone with our piss poor binary systems. ,kumocrew,cs617ec,3,t5_38eyc

Its my understanding if I pledge to the right power then RES hunting will be worth even more than it was before. Will pirating be as profitable as any of these other options I have available?

5231443,0,t1_cvcmn5r,We talked a bit about this over in the Mahon teamspeak since we have had a fair few new players show up recently.One thought experiment involved getting a Type and filling it with rares which admittedly would take somewhere just short of forever then winging up with three new players to share the wing trade bonus with them. That should give each newbie somewhere in the region of cr enough to buy and decently equip a Viper or get a barebones Cobra even when starting from scratch.If they already have a Cobra or better or anything with half decent jump range really then running a decent trade route with one newbie and three veterans in Anacondas will also rack up wing trade bonuses quite quickly and should at least get them into a Type in short order.,kumocrew,cvgkw2g,1,t5_38eyc

7155883,0,t1_d1reofl,A few things here  gt I can see us eventually coming to an agreement where you get to stay in Wadir  I think you will find this is offensive to most of our players and shows a terrible lack of understanding of how the Turmoil mechanic in PP works.  It is going to be impossible for you to make us lose Wadir I know you will think this is untrue there wont be much I can do to convince you other than proving it over the next few months.  gt  According to the powerplay video released by frontier a few days ago the fortification threshold is released once half of the factions are negative towards your control. This has already been reached so putting more control factions in charge wont make it worse.  This is true we want to get rid of two of the minor factions so  arent Feudal or Prison Colonies.  We were going to leave your Dukes of Mikunn faction in Nico alone now you have spread to Wadir we will need to flip more systems because Wadir is currently a Corporation.  You said in your other message that you support Feudal Anarchy and Dictatorships.  We have a problem with  being Feudal we dont care if  are feudal and we dont care if any of them are Dictatorships or Anarchy.  The same goes for expanding your feudal factions in the future we dont care where they go just as long as there is only  of them or less in each of our bubbles.  Undermining us this week hasnt helped make your situation more sympathetic to our players.  Weve already said we have no interest in working against you with the BGS but if you attack us we have been very clear that this is what we must do.,kumocrew,d1rjy64,1,t5_38eyc

Ive flown along side a number of Arhchon pilots and was part of the nonagression act stuff between Archon and Antal and it has been great that two ver different player groups have been able to exists side by side for over a year when it was clearly setup by Fdev that wanted us to try and exterminate each other. Not many folk know this but Im actually quietly a significant chap in one of FDevs most  pirate groups. SO if any of you are thinking of leaving power play but want to be part of a pirate group then drop me a line and Ill point you towards them.If any of you fancy a complete change in PP scenery come over to Antal and see what its like to have fun adventures and play right out i the open with no secret dealings or what not.And if you are just weary and fancy a break for a bit but dont want to relocate then check out Huge respects to  mdingrimsby  PredictedCyborg  McFergus  WithnailAgain DontAskGrim  Mik  ScudAnd many other piratesArrr o,kumocrew,d9beof3,0,t5_38eyc
