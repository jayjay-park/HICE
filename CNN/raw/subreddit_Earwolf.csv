1893523,0,t1_ckh49o0,Yeah the shows become very insular. On the one hand this allows for event episodes like the Womptaculars or the Andy Daly episodes where theres a shared story that everyone is in on. In the early days I dont think stuff that complex would really be possible.On the other hand it is restrictive. Scott does have new guests on every now and then but theres always a returning guest that kind of controls the episode. A recent example is Claudia ODoherty. Shes pretty much playing a character in both of her appearances but is kinda overshadowed by Weird Al and Kroll.,Earwolf,ckhcz4q,7,t5_2se24

However the rest  I love how cantankerous and outspoken Matt can be. I think its one of his strengths... he doesnt care what other people think!Especially if you factor in that he doesnt have a traditional physical appeal to be known as a ranting potsmoking atheist while trying to work in show business? Its a testament to his talent that hes as successful as he is.Of course Case Closed and the philosophy around it is my favorite part of my favorite podcast so Im pretty biased I guess.,Earwolf,cksoy6g,2,t5_2se24

3811973,0,t1_cqql5oy,I think your mistaking the purpose of these threads. The majority of this subs post are overwhelmingly positive and anything negative is almost certainly downvoted to hell and back. These threads provide a safe place for people to discuss negative opinions about very specific aspects of Earwolf without being buried and never discussed. Dont forget that these podcasts are some peoples job. Theyre not doing it for free. thats why there are ads in between every episode. To say that people are whiney spoiled brats and take for granted these podcasts after what seems to be some pretty mild criticisms is really quite childish. Criticism and critique are large parts of the artistic world. To be able to dissect and discover what you like and dont like about a certain product whether it be a TV show podcast video game etc. and discuss it with others is not only enjoyable for the consumer but also beneficial to the creator. Not that I imagine anyone from Earwolf would be reading this thread.,Earwolf,cqqsnjw,7,t5_2se24

It allows new listeners a glimpsepreview into the back catalog which may entice them to pay money for it and it gives the poorer of us a chance to listen to old eps. that we know and love for free. ,Earwolf,cu6t3n9,3,t5_2se24

5717366,0,t3_3tfnz3,I really really like the show.But as others have said when its at a low point its really low.And when its low its not that its not funny  just that its not funny to me. There are definitely podcasts that talk about nothing or that have annoyingbitchy hosts. But I dont listen to those so I just dont find it funny. I cant say omg this is JUST like that one showI think something that may help is if Lauren had some way of establishing control without breaking the premise of the show.For example. What if Traci is working on her confidence. Maybe shes ACTUALLY always been on the room but doesnt speak up until its her segment.And for Year  Traci speaks up during the show occasionally if she has something to say.Because presumably Traci knows each of these hosts and has been present for every episode. So she can act like a cohost if she has to. The way some podcasts let the engineers chime in when they have something relevant to say. Or maybe Traci is learning to BE an AV engineer! And thats why shes present every episode now.So if its not going anyway Lauren can toss herself a bone. Or has a way of injecting more into the world of the podcast the host has created.Anyway this is like talking about expansions you wish theyd make for games you love. Fun to type it all out  but its not gonna happen.

Jack survives but the motivation and intention breaks him free and kills Tyler.So even though its just a one story drop each suicide attempt kills a character but Andy obviously survives.I think Ive put way too much thought into this.

7558613,0,t3_4iqc3l,Savage Lovecast  Your mileage can vary on advice shows sex advice or Dan Savage to be perfectly frank but after a tumultuous period of my love life settled down I found myself binging on it and now its a staple of my podcasting week. I find it informative sexpositive and occasionally eyeopening.Voices of Wrestling  If you like professional wrestling you know theres dime a dozen of podcasts of rassle nerds breaking down RAW and being angry at WWE. This podcasting network I use the term loosely as they all share a podcast feed has some of that but they also cover wrestling at a wider angle including Japanese wrestling European wrestling the show Lucha Underground etc. I pick and choose which podcasts I download on a weekly basis but the flagship podcast and the New Japan Purocast are typically mustlistens for me. This is definitely for the hardcore fan who cant get enough of wrestling not the casual fan or newbie.HowWrestling  This on the other hand is definitely newbiefriendly. Its an English guy a lifelong wrestling fan slowly introducing his enthusiastic girlfriend into the world of professional wrestling. Theyre both very funny likable people with obvious chemistry and theres always a nice balance of healthy criticism when wrestling has been cringey racist sexist etc but also a celebration of why he loves it and shes discovering she likes it a lot too. Worth checking out also if you used to love wrestling but stopped for whatever reason.Switched on Pop  A song writer and a musicologist dig deep on pop tunes.

Ads are a deal breaker for me personally I intentionally buy apps to not have them.  And a lot of Android apps have that kind of paidfree model with no ads and then you can optionally do a monthly service to support them.

10843372,0,t3_5unlao,Hey Tim! When comedy starts feeling a little stale to me there are certain performers who reinvigorate my passion for it and you were one of those for me last year when I heard your characters on the CBB tour. They were so unique and hilarious and it got me excited about comedy again and made me want to try harder and make more unique things myself. So thank you for that.Now my questions How would you compare the process doing characters in longform improv to improvising as a character on a podcast where the focus is mainly just on you? Ive recently started taking improv classes and although I love doing characters sometimes Im afraid of doing more idiosyncratic characters in scenes because it feels like its going to hog all the attention and take away from the scene even though I think they could be good on their own. Do you have any advice on how to pull off weird characters in longform while also not stealing all the attention and making the scene be all about that character? Do you find in general that you have to keep characters a little more neutralreigned in  in longform unless the scene actually calls for the character to be the main focus than on podcasts? Any other thoughts or advice on this topic? Thanks!,Earwolf,ddyf1hr,1,t5_2se24

11540975,0,t1_dg40unz,I think part of the problem is that theres very very few successful podcasts to begin with at least with how we define success. Like the most successful podcasts out there still probably average way fewer listens than any TV show on the bubble. So in some sense HH is popular its definitely in the top half of Earwolf shows in terms of listens and its got a more rabid fanbase than any show on the network. But on the other hand it averages probably K views per episode on the high side which is hard to call successful.,Earwolf,dg466eh,12,t5_2se24

I have some ideas I can fall back on but Id rather not feel like I have to stick to plan because we will probably riff and find something way more fun. ,Earwolf,dg6wg8y,6,t5_2se24
11587155,0,t1_dg9en2c,Thanks for all the links! I actually did start from the beginning initially and thats what got me into it. However I listen to too many podcasts to listen to  episodes so I have been trying to listen to the best there is.

Be it donations buying merch going to live shows or buying their content they put out etc. Nothing against patreon or those podcasts that use it to make bonus content though. This just works better on a consumer financial basis. ,Earwolf,dgk9hgl,5,t5_2se24
