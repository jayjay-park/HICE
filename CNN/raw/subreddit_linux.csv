The problem youre running into is that OpenGL can only deal with straight edges and the only filled shape it knows is the triangle. You cant pass a bunch of Bezir outlines to OpenGL and just let it do its thing. And if you tesselate glyphs into triangles the outcome will look horrible and inconsistent from system to system because the OpenGL specification doesnt enforce algorithms down to the pixel.So you have to use fragment shaders that pin down the exact rasterization process you want. To make matters worse all OpenGL drivers have bugs in their shader compilers also mentioned in the video.GPU guys like Esfahbod or also me its a problem Im researching as well are struggling hard to do beautiful font rendering with OpenGL while being resource efficient. And this is what this talk is all about implementing something that can render high quality glyphs with performance while not hogging all the GPUs resources.Its a very very very hard problem research for ages.

UNIXlike operating systems limit how programs running as different users to interact with each other modern Windows operating systems have also caught up in this aspect.Again youre not going to be any less secure vs any other operating system it boils down to how competent your sysadmins are and your risk.gtWhat are iptables?IPtables filters out specific kinds of internet traffic based on what you tell it to block.gtHow can you really secure your Linux system?Privelege separation deny access to all files your program does not need and go further with SELinux or its alternatives.

155356,0,t1_cew3aie,Anything mechanical with tight tolerances car engine HDD etc. has a bit of luck of the draw in how long it will remain working correctly.That said Ive had  deskstars back in the day that they were fondly called the Hitachi Deathstar.  Both of my parents recent laptops  and  respectively have had modern deskstars in them and had HDD failure usually around the  year mark on the laptops.  And my most recent deskstar was in an OEM dell that was brand new from box and hardly made it  months.My personal experience i would never buy another Hitachi drive if it killed me because everyone ive owned most in OEM machines has died.  Meanwhile Ive got a stack of HDDs from times of yore mostly WD with  maxtors yes even maxtors in there and a handful of samsungs all still working.  And my two  year old seagate barracudas are still kicking but I dont use them for anything more than a place to download stuff until I move it to my NAS due to their age.  They do get hit with a lot more RW cycles than my average drive though so theres that.This whole article is anecdotal anyways while providing actual ownership experience over a large scale it is hardly in a controlled environment and the article even states gt And hey a number of individual Seagate models actually had a longer average age than Hitachi products!The only way to get a real picture of drive failure would be to burnin test those drives over and over again in the exact same way until failure and compare average failure rate.  In a server farm there is no way to guarantee those drives are getting the same thrashing some may be hosting reddit while others are hosting mydns.grandmalulussouprecipes.tx.netI think Seagates quality went downhill when they bought up Maxtor and started using their fab plants for barracuda drives.,linux,cew4ki8,2,t5_2qh1a

189043,0,t3_1w97wn,The fglrx driver is very restrictive it does not cooperate with any other video card drivers on the system. In my system I have three GPUs an integrated intel GPU on my motherboard an Nvidia GTX  in the primary PCIe slot and an AMD R X in the secondary PCIe slot. The Nvidia proprietary drivers are very flexible and will happily share the system with practically any other video drivers and will let you load the driver and Xorg with a libgl.so and libglx.so that is not its own works with mesa and fglrx libs it will even allow you to do things like load the nvidia driver while the card is headless if you want to use the GPU for computing tasks etc.. Meanwhile AMD has gone out of their way to make their fglrx driver silently crash Xorg on boot if it even smells another video driver module or a libgllibglx that is not its own and it certainly does not have the capability to run headless.Since I am using the AMD card primarily for openCL computation I am stuck with the proprietary driver and need to run the card in the secondary slot so that I can still use my desktop while the card is under full load as far as I know I am the only person who has acheived this setup under linux where an Nvidia card is running primary display and an AMD card is in secondary position. It took me a week to figure out how to get the AMD card to cooperate and every other attempt to accomplish this kind of setup that I have read about on the internet resulted in failure with a consensus that it couldnt be done. What I ended up doing is running lightDM in multiseat mode one monitor for each card with the primary Nvidia card loading the AMD libgl.so Nvidia libglx.so and Nvidia driver module in its xorg.conf file nd seat loading the AMD libgl.so AMD libglx.so and fglrx driver module from the amdxorg.conf file the module path in this conf file is specified to a different folder where the fglrx libglx.so file is installed. Also shell scripts are run on startup to initiate synergy server and client instances on each seat to enable single keyboardmouse sharing between seats.

251170,0,t1_cf6qgmc,gt In your argument you are implicitly assuming that the special set of tools is inherently portable and the DBus api is not.DBus is just an IPC mechanism. It merely mediates the actual APIs provided by for example udisks. Theres no practical difference as if udisks were to use a private IPC mechanism which youd use through a libudisks.To stay with this example udisks has been made a part of drumroll systemd. And thereby anything that uses udisks directly has a direct dependency on udisks.Even if you port DBus which actually has been done it doesnt help you a lot if you dont port as well the services youre talking to through DBus. And thats where the problem is. Those services you talk to they have become part of systemd. So this would require to porting systemd. Even worse It forces you to use systemd.Now let me give you a portable counterexample how to deal with dynamic removable storage media management that really would make sense.Traditionally the association between devices and mountpoints has been configured through etcfstab In the past there were a number of dynamic volume managers which were dynamically altering etcfstab to reflect the status of present storage devices. Admittedly this approach led to a number of nasty problemsOne of them is that a single file would contain both statically configured and dynamically created entries. This is of course not a very reliable thing because it makes it very hard to implement atomic changes The reliable way to atomically change a file in nix environments is to write an altered copy to a temporary file and then rename that to the proper file when done. The problem this creates is a race condition between dynamically managed mountpoints and statically configured ones.Another problem this creates is that for users to be able to mount devices PATHmount needs to be suidroot which poses a potential security threat.However a lot of legacy applications and by that I also refer to grown system management scripts tailored for specific applications rely on the etcfstab  mount mechanism. Also often you want to script things like mounting a storage device doing some operations on it and then unmount it. This has been the way to do things among practically all nix systems for decades so changing it creates a lot of problems.But theres an easy way out Make etcfstab contain only the dynamically managed storage devices and mount points. Place the statically configured stuff in a separate configuration like etcfstab.static or if youre following the path of systemd to break with legacy at some other place. Now DEs and applications can put a inotify dnotify or whatever on etcfstab or simply poll it to get informed of changes in the available storage devices. The framework libraries of a DE of course may abstract this behind some DE specific API.In addition to that supply a specially tailored implementation of mount which offers the very same command line interface as the traditional mount. In contrast to that however it will talk to the volume manager through a private API maybe through DBus. That way mount no longer needs to be suidroot. But whats more all the legacy applications will remain to see the entries in etcfstab. For anyone not being root only the devices managed dynamically are of interest for user controlled mount anyway.Summarizing Implement a dynamic volume manager which read static mount point configuration not from etcfstab. Use etcfstab only for the dynamically managed mount points. Provide a non suidroot mount that talks to the volume manager through some authenticated IPC mechanism and is compatible to the semantics of traditional mount. Use some file notify mechanism to keep informed about changes of etcfstab and use the mount  umount utility provided by the system baselayout.Thats the way to do it the right way without disrupting existing infrastructure and driving sysadmins and users alike up the wall.,linux,cf6sdvz,2,t5_2qh1a

So any labeled powervr gets a bad wrap.gt gt  gt gt the experience with powervr on the pandora hasnt been pleasant but it works. The driver comes in  parts theres a open source layer and the binary blob. Problems arise with the open source part as it isnt maintained across kernels. I believe notaz at one point worked on this to get it working with newer kernels.gt gt  gt gt Another issue with the driver has been X support. Early drivers supported DRI which is what we use. Later only supported DRI which is not supported.  But it can be avioded as the driver supports a RAW mode and that works regardless.gt gt  gt gt So choosing powervr isnt ideal but there arnt many options but it can be worked with.gt gt Im on the side of functionality over ideals. I dont care for binary blobs but if it does what i intended to use the gpu for then im ok. For instance ill choose nvidia blob over noueveu for performance every time.gtI disagree with him saying powervr is not a properly supported GPU. There will be a driver and it can be made to work and provide the functions that are expected.gtIf the driver was known not to work then he would be right.Another devport dude said gtThe driver shim is completely open source. I dont really understand how the closed source blob called by the shim makes porting the driver to other kernels and versions of Android more difficult than if it were a full blown open source driver.gtI mean its a library of sorts right? You write the driver to call this library. If the kernel interface changes you rewrite the driver to make the same library calls in a different way. So unless Im mistaken that GPU works and can be made to work well but you just disagree with the closed sourced binary blob?,linux,cf7k0dy,2,t5_2qh1a

Id imagine that most large contributions came after the developer has first started on the smaller stuff which wouldnt happen with the CLA.

So the CLA asks you that up front instead of sometime later after youve moved on and your email address has changed or youve died or otherwise cant be reached to ask.Only the code thats actually relevant for the relicensing. Obviously there are risks with not using CLA if you for some reason plan to relicense the project in the future. This has been seen in practise with cases like libdbus.

I know someone so dedicated to it that he uses a usb version of the keyboardnipple Unless you need a laptop yesterday I would personally hold out on a new thinkpad I suspect better resolution screens are right around the corner. New thinkpads also have this thing for rapid charging something like  battery charge in  minutes or something nutty I believe all thinkpad models support larger batteries and swapping batteries and many with drivebays have options for removing the cdromextra hdd for a battery. My tp has run for  years survived many drops travelled across the world including field use outside in africa been located constantly in a smoking environment since I smoke inside at home  especially when im on the computer had various minor spills. Only thing that has broke was the videocard fan which warranty covered once and I replaced recently myself  for the fan and a hour of my time On top of crazy reliability you can pay various amounts for some unbeatable warranties when I bought mine I was quoted as long as you dont ship the laptop back with the hammer you drove through the screen still lodged in we will replace it  They offer some fairly pricey warranties that basically consist of a guarantee you will have a replacement in lt  hours I heard basically a tech drives to your house to migrate your data to a replacement If you want a good laptop that is going to last you I cant recommend a thinkpad more. If you want something shiny youre going to replace in  years dropping k on a thinkpad might not be worth it. You really dont need a amazing machine to run linux the duocore on my tp is fine the only thing I would like is more ram. The most important thing on a laptop is screen resolution battery life with options non field replaceable batteries are unacceptable and keyboardmouse input.

But it is impossible to create one format that suits all needs. Distributions like gentoo need their own package format...its what defines them to a large extend. Not to mention that a unified format wont help at all. The package format is not the problem. .deb files are incompatible even between apt based distributions because of different version of installed libraries Most prominent there is probably glibc.

386430,0,t3_1yhctk,  You can access the files on the computers hard disk as well. Almost all live USBs will have read and write permission to do this by default you will just have to mount the drives generally as simple as clicking on them in the file manager.  In order for the files to save to the USB you will need a persistence drive. The Ubuntu USB creator lets you do this as do some windows creators otherwise you will have to actually install an OS to the drive in order for it to save there. In either case the files will be saved in such a way that they can be accessed from another computer disclaimer windows doesnt recognise some Linux partition formats make sure you use fat.    USB size depends on the disto you want which depends on what you need it for. You could make due with less than Gb if you wanted something minimal but Id say  is pretty much a minimum.  Alternately you could install any Linux system you like on a virtual machine saved to the USB an open it from a VM client on any given computer. This way you can save anything you want as well as update and upgrade your system install new programs etc. It is a bit tricky to transfer files to and from the host computer but there are forums to help you do this. If this is what you decide go with a big drive probably Gb  as it will essentially be an entire computer living on a flash drive not just some tools you carry around that never change. This also allows you to run your drive on computers that have a BIOS lock although you still need to install a VM client as you simply run it from inside the existing operating system. If you havent played around with them yet VMs will really become your friend.  Have fun feel free to reply if you have any more questions.,linux,cfkti6i,2,t5_2qh1a

403508,0,t1_cfm1w5i,There are quite a few comments about the cost so I thought Id pop in and give you the view from inside Linux Voice.First off Im not going to comment on whether or not its worth the cost. Thats hard for me to be objective about and its obviously different for everyone depending on what you like reading and what level of disposable income you have. Almost all the comments weve had so far are from happy readers so that makes me think it is Adverts  The truth here is that theres very little money to be made in Linux magazine advertising. We could have more ads but the only way wed get more is by lowering the amount we charge and would result in little extra money. This is particularly true since were such a new magazine. Expect a few more ads in future issues but not many. Put simply Linux enthusiasts arent a good market for advertisers. For example a PC gaming mag could make a lot more money from advertising because graphics card manufactures and games companies want to sell them things. The only real market segment for advertising to Linux enthusiasts is web hosting and this isnt a well paying market for advertising.Creating a magazine is an expensive business. More so because were independent and cant leverage the buying power of larger magazine companies. Printing distribution creating content and just regular operating costs hardware insurance and all the other boring stuff all adds up surprisingly quickly. Those prices really do represent the cheapest we can do it for.Weve worked hard to try and strike a good balance between quality and cost. In the UK were the longest magazine in terms of page count as well as being the cheapest in print. On top of that weve got topquality content. So compared to our competitors I think Linux Voice represents real value.To anyone who thinks that were overcharging for personal gain I would like to point out that as yet none of the core team have been paid despite putting in five months of hard work.Were trying to turn Linux Voice into a sustainable way of helping everyone who uses Linux. Thatll be through the free content and the donations to free software causes not just a business that sells a magazine. Im incredably heartened by how many people have chosen to help us achieve this.,linux,cfml8vf,12,t5_2qh1a

Modern generalpurpose filesystems dont corrupt themselves on powerloss a la FAT or HFS.ZFS lacks an fsck entirely and btrfs has a young fsck.My inclination would be to leave both alone unless someone specifically needs a feature that they provide.

But could you guys please do the work to maintain these patches that we need to make the fruit of that subversion actually work?Now I suppose its all well and good for me to wave my arms around in the air yelling those arrogant soandsos how could they? but it would be a tad disingenuous for me to do that without also suggesting a reasonable alternative path for Canonical to take that would allow them to achieve their own reasonable corporate goals while still cooperating with the community that allows their existence.So how about this Still build Mir. Theres nothing wrong with their having their own display server if they really want it. Time will tell whether there was any point to it. Use the Wayland protocols rather than inventing their own that achieve nothing useful that Wayland couldnt provide. There would then be no requirement for upstreams to carry patches specific to Mir because those upstreams could work perfectly well with Mir without even knowing what Mir is. Thats what Wayland is for to provide a set of reasonable protocols that could be shared by multiple display servers to avoid the ridiculous combinatorial explosion of patches in various upstreams and downstreams that would otherwise be required if everyone did their own thing with no cooperation. Work with the Wayland community to get the few tiny tweaks they want in the Wayland protocols.

550754,0,t3_20ewqh,In the Wayland model all of the complexity of X has been stripped out and becomes the responsibility of the compositor to deal with. The lack of network transparency is the most often quoted example of this. Under Wayland networking is not baked in to the protocol. It is up to each compositor implementation to do its own network transparency.  Currently there are some patches for Weston which do it but nobody will use Weston KDE and GNOME both have their own compositor and neither is network transparent.Wayland also changes the way the desktop shell works. It now has to be a part of the compositor either built in or though some kind of private API again not provided by Wayland. Currently none of the compositors implement it through an API which means you can only use GNOME Shell in the GNOME compositor. You cant use GNOME Shell inside Weston to get network transparency. You must pick one or the other.Another change in Wayland is that clients can no longer interact with each other at all. They must go through the compositor but again Wayland provides no API for this. Each compositor must implement its own API with no guarantees of compatibility. One effect of this is that custom panels and docks like docky and plank will not work in any existing Wayland compositor. It is entirely up to the developers of KDE and GNOME whether they want to allow this and whether they want to provide a standard API. Neither currently has any plans to do so.All of these these points also apply to Mir because it is almost identical in design.In short Mir and Wayland roll up the display server the window manager MutterCompizKwin and the desktop shellpanels GNOME ShellUnityPlasma into one huge blob where components cannot be swapped. You will have to choose between GNOME KDE or Unity and if you want more flexibility than that you will have to run a traditional desktop inside an XWaylandXMir root window and give up the ability to run native WaylandMir clients.The bottom line is that Wayland isnt a replacement for X. It is a library that you could use to make a replacement for X  or you could use it to make something totally unlike X. As a result we will see massive incompatibilities between Wayland desktop user interfaces.It doesnt have to be this way. Someone could make a common library that reintroduces all the essential protocols needed to implement a flexible desktop. Realistically though thats not going to happen any time in the next couple of years  and when it is done it might be just as big a mess as X.,linux,cg2vl14,7,t5_2qh1a

So tell me How does the toolkit which is what I meant draw the widgets?Do you think a toolkit draws buttons sliders and so on out of thin air? If you really think that youre one of those people who I suggest to write their own widget drawing routines for an exercise.How about you implement a new styletheme engine for GTK or Qt just to understand how it works?In GTK you have the graphics primitives offered through GDK and Cairo which are points lines triangles rects polygons and arcs. Exactly the graphics primitives X offers as well just that X core doesnt offer antialiasing. But nevertheless they are graphics primitives.And of course a toolkit should use those graphics drawing primitives offered by the operating systemdisplay server to achieve good performance and consistent drawing results.gt And again the nice thing about toolkits is Someone Else Handled That Crap.Indeed. And here it goes. The toolkit should be about handling the widget drawing and event loop crap but not the graphics primitive rasterization crap. And the display system server shall provide the graphics primitves.gt Usually in a crossplatform way so as long as your actual application logic can work on POSIX and Windows your graphics will work on X Wayland Quartz OS X and Windows.The point of a toolkit regarding that is to provide an abstraction layer around the graphics primitives offered by the native OS graphics APIs. And furthermore out of the APIs ignoring POSIX but POSIX doesnt deal with user interaction you mentioned Wayland and doesnt fit into the list? Why you ask? Because except Wayland all the environments you mentioned offer graphics drawing primitives. Wayland however does not.Your argumentation is exactly the kind of reasoning stemming from dangerous half knowledge Im battling for years. Please with a lot of sugar on top just for an exercise Implement your own little widget toolkit. Extra points if you do it on naked memory. Youll find that if you dont have them available already the first thing youll do is implementing a minimal set of graphics primitive for further use.gt have fun rewriting that to express the CSSbased styling through raw X primitivesI could tell you the same but reversed have fun expressing the CSSbased styling without higher level graphics primitives availables.Oh and t can be done using X graphics primitives fairly well.

628955,0,t3_21cniq,While this is the easiest approach to dual boot Window  Ubuntu its also the worst possible option. Wubi works by storing the file system on your existing Windows partition and booting from there. The advantage is that you dont have to bother with stuff like shrinking your Windows partition to make free space for Linux and that removing the Linux distro again is done from Windows just like uninstalling any other program. If thats important to you maybe its the way to go.Its debatable whether it can be called dual booting though. Bare minimum youll be adding an extra level of indirection to all file system operations i.e. it will be slower. Also if something happens to your Windows install itll take down your Linux install with it.You should check out a tutorial on setting up a real dual boot configuration. Only choose Wubi if you find the alternative too intimidating.I didnt watch all of it but I did skip through and this looks like a reasonable tutorial that points out many of the common pitfalls and handholds you through the entire process of setting up a real dualboot configuration.,linux,cgbrhbs,2,t5_2qh1a

746427,0,t1_cgokeft,They have been working on it for years and years now. Its very important for government contractors and other people to have FIPS  certification or similar level of requirements they need to have. I worked at a organization for a number of years where this is important. The level of certification that most people is mostly a bureaucratic type certification.  Ie no testing mostly paperwork to fill out.   Remember this stuff is kinda retarded at first glance but its just how these large level bureaucratic rules work out.So often you not only need to prove that you are using a FIPS approve crypto algorithms but that you are using a crypto module that has been tested for correctness AND that that crypto module does NOT allow you to use nonFIPS approved crypto even if on purpose.There are two major open source FIPS certified crypto modules A special FIPS version of OpenSSL and Mozillas NSS. Since they are open source products they are certified at the source code level not binary signatures like most software crypto.  And there are a whole slew of special environment and compiler options that must been followed carefully for you to build the certified version of these modules.  At least for OpenSSL. Not sure about NSS. Due to how the NSS API works its a bit easier for people to use that in their software and still be able to remain compliant enough. OpenSSL opens up a lot more to application developers but NSS hides a lot of that from the app developers. So there is less rope to hang themselves.And the other crypto libraries and application crypto logic is just right out. You cant really use any of it. So anything compiled against GnuTLS is no good for example. So by Redhat fixing all of this and consolidating crypto they are not only making it easier to properly configure the system but are dramatically reducing the costs and risks for using Redhat for doing government type stuff.Caveats Now there are some extra things you need to do if say you want to make to use FIPS OpenSSL version. It installs parrellel to the system OpenSSL libraries. So you need to be able to prove that when running your software it links to the OpenSSLfips and not the system OpenSSL. Things like that. So read the documentation if this sort of thing matters to you!Personally I like it because it makes it easier to configure the system correctly and I know that  its a lot easier to test one library for correctness then it is for .,linux,cgp4ioh,1,t5_2qh1a

789085,0,t3_236a5l,I believe that this is mostly distro packaging and documentation issue. Distros give users and packages too much freedom to muck around with the sound stack resulting the breakage you have encountered. Windows or OSX do not allow users or applications to rip away major parts of sound stack but Linux distros usually seem quite happy to allow that.Then there is the problem of the cesspool of bad andor outdated advice floating around the web which stems from the poor default configurationpackaging of audio systems and sometimes justified hate for PulseAudio.So fixing audio issues on Linux would involve very little writing of new code and mostly just combing through all the packages of your distro and ensuring that their dependencies and configurations are correct.

They didnt tell him this was an option after his first return nor after his complaint immediately after the repair.gt This isnt a simple case of he took  extra days its a case that he specifically contacted them the day he received the item to complain it wasnt fixed after which they said Welp thats what happens with these displays.gt but then waited another  days after an extended return period would have started to ask for a refund for a product he knew was broken for  days and that he even contacted and complained about it yet to specify what he wanted to do to fix it.Presumably because customer service didnt bother to mention the refund option in any of their contact until after they could say he wasnt eligible. How convenient.gt All Im saying  their customer service is fine and their policies are fine. They dont bend and break rules for customers but thats not bad its just not exception service like EVGA. And like the other guy said  they may have a lemon policy he can use to get a refund anyway.

And what you do most in file browsers is opening files. As a developer youd like to open a filetype with two different applications often. For example youd want to open an HTML file with a browser for viewing and with an editor of your choice for editing. Wading around context menus for the secondary application is getting very repetitive after the th time a day. This application puts this just one easily configurable click away. Also its trying to get out of your face so its closing on each action. Having additional file browsers  terminals open all the time makes window hunting a bit of a chore and id like to avoid it.This.

Its not foolproof because its almost always possible to subvert any command you choose to select into giving you full root access.  The point is to avoid accidents while making it easier.The second reason and the one that matters for security is that you can audit the commands people run with sudo. If people su to root then its a lot more difficult to know what sort of business they are up to. If you are using some sort of network logging mechanism then a user wont be able to prevent you from knowing what they were up to on the system. Thats really all there is to it. If you are aiming for ultimate security then disabling sudo would be preferable but the differences are not really that big of deal. If somebody has access to a users password then they can sniff a root password that gets entered into their account if they are using su.,linux,chlfgze,5,t5_2qh1a

Usually ARPG have the worst PvP experience you can find in a game.Van Helsing has a rather traditional stat and skillsystem. You can pick as many skills as you want. The statsystem isnt split into  just so that only  at maximum matters to your class and you can actually distribute them yourself. Nope it isnt very similiar to Diablo . way too simple isnt that the reason we love to play ARPGs?

Some of this was due to the switch to KDE but to the enduser it doesnt really matter.Amarok  added the middle bar and a lot of customizability that made it clunky and slower to start and the two pane interface was just cleaner looking. The fact that they initially did away with the spreadsheet view that made tag editing so easy caused a lot of gripes.Once they hit feature parity I think it just came down to people still being unused to change and wanting the simple but powerful Amarok that they had been used to.The clean layout and default spreadsheet view is really the only thing that Clementine seems to have going for it that Amarok  doesnt but I dont use Clementine since it seems to crash andor corrupts the database frequently. Importing my library resulted in continual Library Backend database is locked Unable to fetch row errors.

For k they get some good will in the community and they get a seat at the table to direct investment to where it can do the most good to Microsoft and their partners.  Also within an enterprise even the most diehard Microsoft shop is going to have open software running  whether in their network gear within their management appliances their thermostats their fire control systems and who knows what else and many of those will interface with Microsoft servers at some point.

Though I dont suppose there would be any gain in aligning a filesystem at a multiple of KiB if the filesystem itself is going to be using smaller block sizes anyway. And considering that were talking about SSDs the only noticeable gain if any would be in slower degradation of the memory.Im probably overthinking it at this point.  I should be fine aligning everything at KiB.gtWatch out for older operating systems like Windows XP which like to start the first partition on sector Just one sector short too. How nasty.

Everyone has different tastes so thankfully we have a lot of DE options in OSS to meet the needs of most users. Find the one you like and use it.

1421741,0,t1_ciugvx0,gt You have no idea what direct and indirect rendering are.Believe me I do. If you dont believe me just look at my profile over at StackOverflow under the OpenGL tag.Okay here it goes in a gist Indirect Rendering means that the server call it the GPU and its drivers if you like is in charge of scheduling the memory accesses that go into drawing operations memory allocation and so on. All resources are ultimately in the control of the server.With direct rendering the client is in charge of the resources and all operations between the client and the server have to be fenced.When it comes to OpenGL vs. the X server then a Direct Rendering OpenGL context means that all client operations bypass the X server and go directly to the driver. The driver then has to retroactively fill in the X server about the state changes that affect it.Now please have a look at old fashioned OpenGL up to about OpenGL Client side vertex arrays glEnableClientState glVertexPointer synchronized copy operations glVertexPointer  glDrawElements make a full copy of the data in client space here stalling the client wasting its precious CPU cyclesand now compare this to OpenGL Server side Vertex Buffer Objects and Vertex Array Objects and Vertex Attrib Bindings glGenBuffers glBindBuffer glBufferData glVertexAttribFormat glVertexBindingDivisor  technically you could still coax an offset into glVertexAttribPointer but thats a deprecated API. In OpenGL you no longer are allowed to pass in a client pointer you must pass an offset into a server side buffer object cast to a pointer thereby completely violating the C specification causing undefined behavior. asynchronous copy operations. You can still use glMapBuffer to map a piece of server memory into client address space however you must unmap it before using it in any OpenGL operation this unmapping is a synchronous operation. Hence to reduce the workload use glMapBufferRange. There is an extension that allows to keep a buffer object mapped but you still have to use memory barriers and fences then. Essentially the memory is the servers who has the last say about it.gt Most of the fancy modern OpenGL stuff NVIDIA has been pushing is about removing the clientserver approach that OpenGL has traditionally taken and using pointers directly.Actually no. If youre not intimately familiar with how OpenGL works it might look this way but what this really does is placing server and client in a contract. The server is bound that once the memory for a certain object is allocated it will not change its layout and location for as long as the object lives. The client on the other side promises that it will not stomp on the servers feet by using properly memory barriers and synchronization fences.Note that this does remotely means that server and client have to run on the same machine. Address spaces have been virtual for a very long time now for CPUs and for the most recent generation of GPUs as well. And modern operating systems provide things like RDMA that allow to map another machines address space through high bandwidth links.If you want to look at an API that abolishes the clientserver model of graphics you have to look at AMDs Mantle. Or better yet just use glBufferSubData for updates. Unless you optimize the last cycle out of your rendering loops glBufferSubData consistently gives much better performance. For textures it even avoids the problems that the memory layout of the image data must be planar while for the GPU a tiled layout may be better. Using glTexSubImage gives the implementation a single point where data layout rearrangements may happen.EDIT Typo footnote divider.EDIT RDMA Comment about Mantle.,linux,ciuhr3u,6,t5_2qh1a

The standards guarantee very little there is no single community around these languages hence they have hundreds of different coding styles the tooling is shit horrible build systems linking hell compilers dont fully implement the standard and there are no good CC IDEs thanks to the preprocessor and the complexity of the syntax.The compilers rarely provide helpful feedback. Modularity is achieved by concatenating header files together leading to stupendously long compilation times.

1636503,0,t1_cjlfmu6,I agree with both you and with uRandomDamage.My very laymans understanding is that there is a tangle of licenses contracts obligations and probably intangible businessrelationship stuff involving cable companies content producers broadcasters and advertising clients  easily many tens if not hundreds of companies when you look across the gamut of all the content that we all wish was available for reasonable prices online netflix or otherwise.That business model is too old ingrained many of the contracts too new and the number of stakeholders far too high to think that Netflix or Hulu is going to shake things up enough to change all the minds that need to be changed for us to see some kind of sudden shift in how online content is treated by those companies.I agree that it needs to happen but right now they have all the power and nothing really motivating them to change.  Though things like the Netflix vs HBO revenue revelation seems like the first straw of many that will be required to start breaking this camels back.The only real pressure they are getting is the fact that piracy is so easy for anyone with a shred of understanding but thats not much pressure at all since so many people use computers as appliances only these days.I think a few things will help over time though  Nonsavvy nonpirates need to start to care that they are being punished for following the rules and complain loudly about it. Things like PopcornTime need to happen more often and get more popular so that the ability to endrun around bizarre and consumerpunishing distribution practices for example  the lack of quite a lot of content availability in Australia by any legal means becomes something that nongeeky users can handle. Young blood in corporate board rooms.  I dont have so much faith in this because so far its failed to do much for US politics... Other stuff... But whats not going to happen for sure at this moment in time is that they all suddenly have a change of heart and realize they should be embracing drmfree online distribution of content.  So IMO for now we need to content ourselves with being happy when things are available and they work....  ,linux,cjlg2gj,13,t5_2qh1a

At that point the availability of vi on every platform is a pretty moot point.  OP should be trying some editors for a couple of weeks and figure out which one fits best with his workflow.  I used to use vim Im now an Emacs guy I can do a small edit on any machine using straight vi without any problem but I definitely dont want to use vi for  hours a day.

I then played around with FreeBSD Debian and Red Hat. Back then it was such an accomplishment just to get the OS installed and up and running. Some of the early cool stuff I did was set the machine up so I could dial in remotely with a modem learned to use LaTeX for really nice typesetting of papers and set up an overnight downloader to grab Windows game demos or other software from FTPs. I had a null modem cable connecting the  to the home PC since I did not have Ethernet ports on either machine. This let me log into the  as well as transfer files back and forth.,linux,cjxr4x3,1,t5_2qh1a

He doesnt care if Haiku is on Linux or not he just wants a working BeOS implementation as soon as possible and Haiku doesnt do it for him right now.One of the Haiku devs replied to this by saying that its not possible to answer this since contributions have started to become infrequent I dont remember the exact wording so there is no way to give an estimate which imho is the biggest thing to take away from that thread I didnt know that Haiku had a lack of contributors from reading their news feed sporadically it all sounded as if they are making good progress.

Your claim that this trend is somehow driven by keyboard focus falls flat when you observe that all the major browsers targeted mostly at Windows users of all levels of expertise are following it too. Yes we have lots of pixels available but it doesnt mean there shouldnt be a careful evaluation of what to use those pixels for. I dont know from what authority you claim most of us dont mind sparing  pixels I certainly do if it means seeing dozens of infrequently used options occupying space all the time.Thats not to say I discard any solution using more height automatically just that it has to provide a good improvement in organization to be worth that.

1803713,0,t1_ck65wd6,From what I can glean from the post if the .. runtime is released then Firefox will run against that runtime. He said the default logic will probably dictate that the most recent specified runtime is booted up in the containers. The blame would be on the runtime vendor if they introduce an API breakage between updates within the same vendorid in this case GNOME. If they introduce an api breakage it should be released under a new differentiated vendorid .. Furthermore he said that the subvolume naming scheme isnt final. There might be a change that allows app subvolumes to specify a hard dependency on a specific runtime version though I think it shouldnt be necessary as long as runtime vendors are responsible and dont release api breakage under the same vendorid Like how GNOME and GNOME are separate vendorid in the example.gtWhat if my application links to gmp libxml and mpi? Will I as a developer be expected to test my application and send out updates every time any one of those libraries updates?He states that each app only has access to the runtime available to it. If your app needs a few extra libraries they should be bundled into your subvolume just like how android apps are distributed.On your last point about pushing the work onto developers I guess you can look at it that way. But the way I see it with this scheme vendors are able to release crossdistro runtimes that are guaranteed to work because everyone will be running in the same environment because everyone is using containers. Furthermore the workload on distributions and packagers is reduced. They can now pool their resources into helping upstream improve or fix up their runtimes because everyone will end up using the same image anyway might as well share the work. So the packagers jobs I guess is changed from Taking upstream and packaging it for my distro to something like Help make upstream usable on all distros including my ownIn short I think itll reduce work for everyone in the longterm because it cuts down on duplication of effort.But all this is assuming that other distros take up this change. I have a feeling Arch might be on board.,linux,ck6i7r3,5,t5_2qh1a

They tend to gloss over the fact that OS X plays to a different audience too.  Perhaps because both of them are commercial desktop operating systems with similar ecosystems of software production and distribution that treats programs as a source of profit.I dont think Im alone in that misconception.  It shows through when people complain about Linux software documentation that the average Windows user cannot understand when they try to use programs that dont act like all users are complete novices and when they point at the command line and want to know how an average user can be expected to use it.  They try to use market share as evidence that no one actually uses Linux forgetting that it is not distributed through commercial channels.

That doesnt require any of your bad suggestions.gtThis means deciding democraticaly by majority vote dropping the needless burden of supporting inferior optionsand and sticking to this defaults For instance as positive example recently it was voted and decided by debian that systemd will be THE init system. This was the final stone for the linux ecosystem as even later Ubunut admits the the defeat of upstart and that the will switch to systemd. This is great and one of the required standardization steps to form finally a linux stable desktop platform. Yes this means focussing and cutting away minority options on levels which dont provide real choice for the end users but prevent choice amp quality on levels which matters for end users number and quality of available apps currently only max. . of apps available for the linux desktop while proprietary desktop platforms provides millions and have killer apps.You dont seem to understand. I have no problem at all with Debian or anyone else deciding to do away with the ability to have choice in their distro. I do not care. I am perfectly and absolutely fine with Debian saying that on Debian you will use systemd and glibc and a bunch of other things that we set unilaterally. Thats fine and I have always thought that it was fine.I have an issue with people that seem to have a compulsive need to eradicate distributions that arent that authoritarian. Sorry but while systemd might barely work for all of Debians users it does not work for everyone. It does not work for me. And I am going to continue to use Gentoo where I can happily use something that wasnt designed by a braindead chimp that has ruined everything hes ever touched.Again I have no issue with people that want to standardise on something. Ignoring the fact that we already have a standard init system called sysvinit if they want to standardise on something thats absolutely fine. But to suggest that we should do what?

In X all applications can accept your keystrokes by default even if the window is unfocused and hidden under all the other windows.This will make a lot of things inconvenient for developers who are used to doing things the X way.It is likely that different display servers will offer APIs so that apps like a screenshot tool can exist that application would need to be able to see the content of all of the windows which it would not be able to do with just the minimum Wayland API.

Generally there is two ways to save progress in a videogame.One way is to essentially dump the state of the game from memory to disk and then resume later on. This is what game console emulators usually do with save states this method is a bit flaky because even different versions of the same emulator can break compatibility with the saves so its only used when theres no other way with emulation you cant modify the games themselves to add proper save features like old NES games for example so this is the only way to implement saving.The second method is what pretty much every game has in common usage. The save file is written out in a predefined static format its usually binary but lets imagine its a text file so you can understand it better. Our imaginary file could perhaps have tags like HTML tags that define what level youre at how much ammo you have your score a list of items in your inventory and any other important data.In Minecraft the world file basically just includes a huge list of blocks with XYZ coordinates for all the blocks as well as your characters spawn point.

1997094,0,t1_ckttef6,Uhm just because HTTP via CGI or a similar interface that uses environment variables to pass request arguments into the client program is the most straightforward attack path doesnt mean that shellshock isnt exploitable through other paths. Anything that sets environment variables to usersupplied values without sanitizing creates a subprocess running bash in that environment...is vulnerable. CGI is one example that is highly exploitable but its very easy to think of other ways. Countless UNIX programs have implemented extensibility by means of shelling out i.e. setting a bunch of environment variables and then calling customizable commands through a shell  this is really very standard procedure and the general idea is that as long as you control which variables to write to and those variables dont have a special meaning to the shell anything you put in them is fair game you only need to worry about what the payload program does with them.,linux,cktulvk,2,t5_2qh1a

2032524,0,t1_ckwnj9m,Edit I am employing the ... operator because I wrote the exact oneliner it takes to parse the header above. Sort of. Its not exactly fulfilling the HTTP spec because people made it more complicated than it needs to be originally. In practice it would parse things just fine.As to the second point trying to do this causes someone to take over my machine.  In any case the total system complexity is such that someone must parse the HTTP Request to determine where it must go  though if youre lucky all you really have to handle is the GETPOSTHEAD line and the rest can be passed on to whatever has been registered there. In your case there is some classically vulnerable language such as C doing that string processing and potentially overflowing godknowswhat buffers. So yes simple from your point of view but Id rather hand parsing jobs to something else. Think of this as a simple preference.As to the complexity of above I have actually written a web server like thing in Perl once based on HTTPDaemon and then had to emulate CGIlike environment for it it was really a PersistentPerlSpeedyCGI program. The request side was simple enough to deal with but unfortunately CGI scripts wrapped in this environment still print headers and response body to STDOUT and I did have to hijack STDOUT to an inmemory string and then write a header parsing code similar to above to turn the scripts response back to HTTPResponse so that HTTPDaemon can handle it. Its probably pretty inefficient and nasty but nevertheless it still benchmarked better than the previous technology!Perl is a mess. It seems like rather few people are working in this space in practice. Did you know that there doesnt even seem to exist any utility methods to parse POST parameters out of a HTTPRequest? Old hand CGI.pm can do it of course but you first have to muck with its rather gory API to get it parsing anything at all. Then again even with java it took until servlet spec . before servlets were able to handle multipart POSTs.

2100242,0,t1_cl6r78a,The problem is that its completely possible to make a device unrootable in practice.This may sound like a grand statement but think of this carefully if the CPU does not allow the running of unsigned code then youd have to find a bug in firmware allowing  arbitrary code execution and then you have to prevent this thing from updating its own firmware because if it does it can pop an eFuse to essentially revoke all old firmware keys which will prevent any firmware downgrade hacks.So while the above doesnt prevent hacks it sorta does in practice its no longer a matter of just hacking a device once and then its hacked forever. They have now turned it into a never ending arms race that the hackers will never be able to win if only because there are way too many devices out there. The really popular devices may get lots of interest from hackers but many devices will just remain locked down forever.This problem has to be solved by making open source mainstream and relevant enough to users that no one buys locked devices to begin with.

2135516,0,t1_clb8sgh,Alright so if I take a look at purging systemd on my system I dont see Chromium listed as one of the applications which would then be removed if I was to do so. Which would make me think that Chromium instead doesnt directly depend on systemd today and that the devs have done a fairly decent job keeping the two working separately. So no bug then IMO.However I did see four packages installed on my system which did seem to indeed depend on systemd which likely shouldnt IMO nautilus brasero networkmanager and aptdaemon While Im not particularly using the last one and could probably do without it I would have some concerns about that one if it gets integrated a bit more into Debian proper and would think that filing a bug over its integration level with systemd would be appropriate. The others not as much since those are components of Gnome there are alternatives to using them and without getting the Gnome developers on board to continue to support nonsystemd configurations theres not really a lot which Debian could do other than to fork them and the added maintenance burden would probably be rather undesirable.As long as udev can continue to work outside of systemd or there is a binary drop in replacement which provides the same interface which could be used using a metapackage for providing it and then having a predepends which lists udev | whatever the alternate package it is which the package can then depend on if udev for some strange reason does stop to support anything other than systemd then theres no problem. And overall outside of Gnome itself and which Debian really isnt in a position to control outside of either dropping Gnome and its apps that depend on systemd or forking them Debians been doing that for my own uses so far.EDIT Alright since theres been a downvote let me specify that udev and systemd are provided separately in Debian and that udev can still be used without needing to use systemd. If you still choose to use systemvinit Chromium is still usable within Debian so there is no systemd dependency even if udev is incorporated in the same repository. Hence why I would think that there would be no bug here and that the way it is currently maintained its doing a good job in keeping the two issues separate. Gnome on the other hand is different and I would consider it to be something which could get reported as an issue but without upstream cooperating I dont see how this would get resolved short of removing Gnome or forking it.While I use systemd myself I do so for pragmatic reasons. I am actually not a big fan of how it is currently managed and would like to see the devs be forced to modularize things a bit more instead of Potterings pseudomodularization where he claims that because there are so many separate binaries that there isnt a modularization problem. But Im not going to just throw the baby out with the bathwater in the mean time because I have a management complaint if its going to solve other issues.

Nothing like that has been reported in german media the only things having been reported here was the fact that the mayor iswas unhappy and thought about switching back. Not a single outlet here wrote like that was a fact. The FSFE has a deep history of biased reporting on no existing grounds. They have an agenda just like proMicrosoft press. Hell even Torvalds doesnt like the FSF in part for that reason.On this specific topic get your news from trusted german media or even better read the reports on the city of Munichs site themselves if you dont you might as well watch Fox news.In short there is nothing to report on thats worth any discussion.,linux,clc27pm,1,t5_2qh1a

I wont claim I have followed this debate closely though it seems to be the opinion of most debiansystemd proponents that this GR is more than that.Imagine what would or will happen ifwhen systemd is the norm used by almost all distros and much software depends on it. Debian would have a hell of a time trying to support other init systems for all such software packages with no help from upstream... Either that or perhaps those many packages would be removed entirely from debian.I do agree that such an unexpected switch should be considered a bug but that scenario seems unlikely to occur after the switch is compete. ,linux,clcvfi1,5,t5_2qh1a

2191223,0,t1_clibp68,gt Next up is the fact that the systemd developers were already pretty much the maintainers of many of these packages except stuff like cron I guessCron is a bit of a special case. With systemd all the daemons will be started in cgroups and locked down with the additional security features that systemd automatically makes use of. And then you have cron running in parallel also starting potentially daemons but with out all these nice things. systemd offers its timers as an alternative to cron that does makes use of all these things and at the same time has an IMO far more readable configuration style. systmed timers and cron has no problems being used in parallel. Patches to add crontabgenerator an automatic interpreter of the crontab file to systemd timers has even been rejected upstream so I really dont think it is fair to say that systemd is making a hostile take over. Sure it is creating competition by a making what I consider to be  a better alternative to cron. Patching cron to do what systemd times does would likely be a bigger task than writing the new tool itself.,linux,clicw88,21,t5_2qh1a

When Linux started being loaded on computers that were mobile and connected to carious different networks using different devices nic and wireless youd have to jerryrig your network startup script to  select a network that you wanted to connect to at boot time.   The way around jumping through these hoops was by creating NetworkManager.  NetworkManager was the default network manager at boot up time for many distributions.  It allows users to select which interface to connect to in a nice menu driven way.  The problem was that this wasnt meant for servers.  Sys Admins were generally savvy enough to do    service NetworkManager stop    chkconfig NetworkManager off    chkconfig network on    vi etcsysconfignetworkscriptsifconfigeth       service network startNetworkManager requires a user to be logged in on the console to use most servers dont anyone logged in at the console,linux,clik4s5,-1,t5_2qh1a

Are these packages just bundles or are they also properly sandboxed for example? the solution from the FedoraGnome camp seems to be also factoring sandboxing into the equation.My main problem with Canonical is the lack of collaboration as weve seen with Mir being first or second isnt the issue here. If Mir was a better approach than Wayland and was better designed and further ahead we could still accuse them of NIH but at least there would be value in it and it would be legitimized as being the right approach but that isnt the case instead Mir is either the same damn thing or does everything wrong in the few places where it deviates from Wayland and its also further behind in development.,linux,cljk759,-3,t5_2qh1a

This is a better default to avoid people losing the connection to a system they are installing by ssh halfway around the globe because they forgot to ask for stable interface names and now it wont come up because the scripts are referring to the wrong interface. And it will just work for the ones that dont care.Using the MAC as the interface identifier is wonderful actually. If one uses that name in a script she will know exactly what will happen every time.

I have a very smart little sister who spends hours in minecraft building out this very elaborate virtual world for example.

Sync needs to be served from the server because it can change more often than the browser  some organizations stick with LTS others with whatever fixed version they had when they started. The serverside Sync code is poorly documented because its not a vital part of the browser and Mozilla has very limited resources so they invest as much as they can in Gecko. Hell the entire options window is outdated and most of those options could go under an advanced tab the way Chromium hides most of the stuff that nontechies wouldnt understand. The link to selecting other servers was practically useless because there was little interest in using rd party Sync servers and made their users confused because they didnt know what it meant.I worked with enough Google code and services to know fuck you design when I see it.

2943998,0,t3_2tv33i,Choice is the big one. Throw all your shit into AD SQL server and .Net and youre at the mercy of licensing which is a big opex cost on windows. A lot of people dont think too far into this in initial company infrastructure deployments but as you scale up those licenses add up and turn into this big shitball called Volume Licensing and compliance. You never know how much youre going to pay out. In a recent audit we found out that that we were down on SQL server licenses due to ambiguous definition of cores and logical processors. k down the shitter instantly and we had no choice as we were locked into the platform decision.Then theres the sheer lack of reliable automation in windows. Even with PS  of what you need to do is impossible and  is eye gouging fights with COM automation shitty documentation and bugs. People are still employed to poke the UI with a mouse and thats costly and frustrating.Thirdly the big one for us is when something goes bang. Two stories Firstly Internet Explorer  introduced a major regression that broke ClickOnce application deployment. Its still not fixed today. So now we have to push out a registry fix to  people at over  disparate organisations because its a black box. It took us  months to get that fix out of MS as a paid up gold partner. We dont know why its broken cant see inside it. Cant work around it. Just have to live with it. Second one is when something goes snap in production. Your application sits as a thin layer on a deep stack that you cant get inside easily. Youre at the mercy of every problem in that entire stack.So for me cost automation choice transparency and debuggability make Linux win for me. Now for all the avoidable time we pissed out of the window on windows we worked out it was to the tune of  over ten years. And the risk when stuff does blow up is scary. Weve had hours of downtime azure style! thanks to stupid bugs.Id never start a business on it again and were moving shit to Linux CentOS Java Spring and Postgres slowly.

If those bits get flipped during any part before you write data you will have corrupted data on disk. You will have no idea that there is corruption too.BtrfsThis would behave exactly the same as ZFS. btrfs reads data from the disk to corrupted memory realizes the data is corrupt and regenerates it into another section of memory from the other disks that is presumably also corrupted and writes that to disk.So... ext handles it far far worse you would have no idea that corruption is going on and btrfs at best handles it exactly the same as ZFS with the added bonus of potential bugs.This of course ignores the likelihood of having two permanently stuck bits in precisely the right spots that isnt otherwise negatively affecting the system. The far more likely scenario is that you get temporary bit flips that means you reallocated a sector on one of your disks for no reason or that if it happened before any writes to any disks ever happened you are immediately alerted on the next scrub.,linux,co46e4c,2,t5_2qh1a

2990047,0,t1_co7wc48,Well its their promise to open source.  Seems to me they could open source as they work on it.  Why not just make it an open source project to begin with rather than leave room for the possibility it may remain closed source until someone decides otherwise.What with Kickstarter faiures it seems to me paramount to not make open source a promise after the funding but do it now  thats one less promise they have to keep and removes any suspicion that theyll stay closed source and use that for a forprofit venture.I dont have a problem when someone says theyre going to stay closedsource  thats being up front and whoever parts with their money has no expectation otherwise.  I just dont think there is any justification for holding back on opening something if thats your intention at the outset.It reminds me of Google Wave  Google said they were open sourcing it but the fact is they didnt in my opinion.  After they announced they gave the project to Apache you could not go to Apache pull the code and run something similar to what Google had  far from it.  Im guessing and this is only my speculation and not a statement of fact that Google said they are open sourcing it gave out less than  i.e. everything necessary to create a similar experience and took a hefty deduction on their tax returns of acquisition and development costs knowing that the IRS and other taxing authorities are not going to verify whether it was truly open sourced and then deny the deduction.  This just made me realize you can open source your projects and basically writeoff your development costs thereby having the taxpayers fund your development  what a great business tactic! So its from this experience and my perception thereof that I treat with great suspicion promises to open source.  You can open source something the moment you made the decision and thats the end of if you dont need to make a promise to do so.,linux,co7wza5,1,t5_2qh1a

Every release gets better but it still pales in comparison to WPS sheets and still has massive issues with complex documents. So adding test cases like this is just adding noise to the tracker and wasting developers time on rare corner cases that may not even be valid.I work in IT and pushed hard for a LibreOffice on our last Office upgrade cycle. During that time I filed bugs and added myself to  issues. Almost  years later  remain nearly all interoperability issues. Progression is great but still no where near good enough to make the cut on the next cycle. Had we switched we would have donated to TDF and likely opened a support contract with Collabora.

There are benefits to both methods but it depends on what you are trying to do in terms of sandboxing.  Utilizing your hosts X opens up potential system access to Chrome and whatever is running in your Chrome container but on the flip side youre using ssh tunneling into a container which always feels icky to me any time ssh is being used in a container in some sort of workaround fashion.I like what Jess is doing here as it is ready to take advantage of some new features that will hopefully make this a much cleaner process not needing the wider privileges to be opened up and it doesnt require installing anything extra on the host wadditional configuration to get it working.

Universal and the decision in the latter case specifically talks about how the ability to sue for misrepresentation is the balance in the DMCA.I do wish someone would fund a legal team to go after everyone who uses robots to issue DMCA notices.,linux,coup52f,173,t5_2qh1a

This should be reserved for display managers and the like.You can do every control you like through PolicyKit but that doesnt really change the point that those DBus methods are supposed to be called through PAM.From the point of view of capabilitiesPolicyKitwhatever it makes no difference if the DBus method is called directly from the application or from a library in its address space PAM in our case.gt Because despite the implication that its a standard PAM is not really standardized.Slackware is the only distribution that Im aware of that doesnt use it.

3470988,0,t3_300b3w,There is an actual problem here.Some of us prefer the command line because it is better from our point of view. Its quicker more powerful more flexible more robust lighter and far more elegant and refined. The command line feels far more modern to me in many instancesuses than a GUI. Its one flaw is the steep learning curvelack of discoverability kinda its arguable. Its certainly lesseasily discoverable than a well designed GUI.If a new user asks me how to do something Ill often tell them the command line way where appropriate partly because not doing so feels like a disservice  like Im telling them the inferior clunky oldfashioned way. This acts alongside the fact that the command line way is more likely to be standard between distros than the GUI way.But the new user generally doesnt see what we see. To them its the command line thats the oldfashioned clunky way of doing things because of DOS and because simply thats how people interacted with things in the past and the modern way must be better.Their impression is not that we use the command line out of choice because we prefer it but that we use it because we have to. Linux requires you to use the command line because its old fashionedunfinishedjust for codersetc..This represents a crucial and fundamental communication problem.We the Linux community in general and distros in particular need to get across that those of us who use the command line a lot do so out of choice because its often better. And that it is not necessary UbuntuCanonical do a good job here I feel. On top of that we need to find ways to expose the beauty elegance and sophistication of the command line to new users in a way that communicates those qualities unambiguously.Im not suggesting for a second that the command line is always better and Linux does indeed sorely need more better quality graphical desktop applications particularly productivity and creativity stuff. Nor is it for everyone casual users dont necessarily want power and sophistication they just want ease and thats fine we need to make clear that they are catered for better than on Windows in my opinion too. But the command line is a huge asset to Linux and we need to be proud of that in a way that makes clear why that is the case.edit tldr The commandline has a PR problem and that matters.,linux,cpnx1kp,321,t5_2qh1a

3535012,0,t3_30pgob,I use OS X because I value good design in products that I use especially when those products are ones that I myself am using to build and create things for others and solve problems.Its like being in a very wellmanicured neighborhood. When youre surrounded by great applications and tools that exhibit great attention to even little details it inspires you to work a bit harder yourself and when youve got one house that doesnt care it really sticks out. Use a Java app that uses the Swing UI toolkit on Windows or Linux and nobody will really bat an eye. Open that same app on OS X and it really looks like crap.From a more pragmatic perspective these tools just allow me to be more productive and I value that above all. Awhile back I would have told you it was because the Mac is the only platform that lets me natively use Photoshop Microsoft Office and a suite of Unix utilities all in the same OS. Today the best tools for me are ones that are only available on OS X OmniGraffle Tower Pixelmator Postico Alfred TextMate Reeder etc. Packaging tools have improved dramatically in the last decade Homebrew is a godsend. Odds are any Unix tool I am planning to use is available on OS X. Worst case scenario I am one VM away from running just about any other OS imaginable including another instance of OS X. I probably could switch to Linux and get by okay. A lot of my favorite desktop apps would probably get replaced with webbased counterparts which I consider worse but I would still be able to get by. It wouldnt make me very happy though. I would probably feel better about using more FOSS products. I want to do that about as much as I want to go vegan though.I sometimes see people pointing to some successful commercial product that has an opensource counterpart and acting like Im killing open source for using it. Thats always rubbed me the wrong way. I dont go shitting on IRC because its not as joyful to use as Slack I just quietly and happily use it along with hundreds of thousands of others. The closest Ive seen anyone come to taking an Applelike philosophydriven approach to Linux is Ubuntu and within the Linux world thats worked really well for Ubuntu.

Doesnt seem like a productive goal for a project that aims to be a cleanbreak from legacy code.gt It was good until  versions. Went downhill fast after that. On performance or UI? And unlike Chrome you can actually completely replace the Firefox theme. Thats what I do and have done for years.gt Then theres the things they never got there with like implementing a separate UI threadTrue but not that relevant in practice since final performance is what matters and Firefox doesnt do too bad. Pertab processes are much more important since they have security advantages that cant actually be achieved at all without them.

Race conditions are all over the place. Thats why all the people actually in charge of maintaining those scripts for the repositories ditched it after seeing a strong competitor last for a few years. Just because it successfully starts a bash script does not mean its stable or reliable. Yes it did what it does but theres more to proper init and shutdown than starting a new process.

Die sizes arent shrinking as quickly but technology is still evolving. x is basically an instruction VM.

Developing for mobile platforms was obnoxious as hell  years ago. And theres still a hundred more things still under research like various nonvolatile RAM concepts.As far as software the principles may not change that much but changing software needs and libraries alter the surface quite a bit.

If for example you compromise a Apache Web server then you install malicious Apache module so you can piggy back on top of legit web traffic and not be detected.  Even better if the website is using SSL then all your traffic is encrypted and cannot be sniffed.  If you are attacking a DNS server then you can use DNS requests to a special zone as your command and control.mechanism.  If you are attacking a email server then you can use emails to do it.Even if you dont want to do that its still trivial to setup teredo tunneling and connect any system you want to the public IPv internet just as long as any UDP traffic is able to originate from the server you are attacking and that way you dont have to worry about the UDP tunnel being tracked back to you. This will trivially bypass any firewall that allows outgoing udp traffic.  Similar things can be setup using TCP traffic of course. Even if you do not have to do any of this stuff its still better to do it as a attacker because most people dont have the ability to detect it.So thinking a simple portblocking firewall will stop malicious services on a compromised machine is kinda delusional.. if only because people dont actually open up new ports on machines they want to maintain control of.Its real purpose is just to protect applications you have running from listening for from unwanted ip addresses. ,linux,cq4koqk,2,t5_2qh1a

Seems like there is a stable API and an unstable API. Maybe the instable API uses systemd internal things e.g. tell systemd as it is the cgroup manager some things that you dont need if you need to talk to another cgroup manager. Or using the common logging functions that all binaries in the systemd tree use. If you develop something external youll do your own logging.But these is an assumption I cannot really say this. But Im still adamant that systemd has a stable API for this. And that systemd interface stability promises got extended over the years systemd is already  years old and once something was declared stable it stayed that way. You still havent shown me the contrary and Im  confident that you cannot gt  thats because xrandr can access hardwarespecific featuresNo xrandr doesnt touch the hardware. It runs as user not as root. It communicates first to the xserver and the xserver to X graphics driver and the X graphics driver to the kernel driver. And this one does then touch the graphics. However if you go via so many participants then the communication a.k.a. the API must be identical. If xrandr has an enum where entry  means read HDMI socket but the x graphics driver from the previous X version doesnt have it then chances are slight that you can activate your read HDMI socket. And when I look at the monthly i mails from Intel or what AMD is doing then I dont think that the xrandr API of X is really stable. It gets extended all the time.But still parts of it are stable and tools like krandr can at least configure the most common things.

Evidently it does not support the creation of device nodes which is a very big limiting factor here.With regards to device nodes I was thinking youd mount a devtmpfs or tmpfs over dev.  Shouldnt be a problem.gt You also cant even chroot into the directory it results in a permission denied error. Ive definitely chrootd to FUSE filesystem before.  I dont see why itd care.  My guess would be the permission denied is unrelated to the fact its a fuse filesystem rather than a normal one.  Ive not tried specifically this though  my guess could be wrong.gt Maybe if I mounted google drive as root... but that seems like a bad idea.Yes this whole endevour is a Bad Idea TM.  I wouldnt be surprised if it violates the google drive terms of service somehow.  Pursuing it to the eventual end of mounting it as root will be strictly required to use it as your root filesystem I think.,linux,cqoa2t4,2,t5_2qh1a

For a number of lectures it made sense or was even required to have Linux installed  technical uni. It was split into three parts. First there was a lecture about Linux how its different from windows and Mac benefits and downsides popular software alternatives or cross platform software that also exists for Linux. Second there were installation events. Usually two. The club invited geeks to help out installing Linux on participants computers. The helpers were paid by being invited to a nice dinner in a nice restaurant. The participants had to sign a waver that they understood the risks of data loss etc and accepted that there was no warranty and were advised to do a backup before. We usually had one default distribution opensuse for a while later Ubuntu but also offered help for other distributions. Third a workshop for those interested in more in depth things. More details about system configuration intro to the shell common useful programming tools. Stuff like that. I helped out a couple of times. Be warned that this takes a lot of time a lot of people and a bit of infrastructure. Uni offered rooms and a gigabit link to the Internet also loads of wires. The club organised network hubs and such. Also the club was subsidised by the uni.. But it is very rewarding to help all these people. However we had the luxury that most participants were techies themselves open to new things and often actually needed Linux for their studies. Participation was for free. And I learned that Linux on Mac can be a bitch. Best of luck! ,linux,crdlb24,5,t5_2qh1a

4016144,0,t1_crdy5xe,This is just so horribly wrong Im not even sure where to start. How could you possibly believe this?The less thought you have to put into operating a machine the more thought you can put into your actual work. This is a crude example but imagine you use a keyboard that requires a special keycombo for every letter typed. Doing your work is still possible but it will require so much extra concentration just to operate youll barely be able to focus on your actual job and will be at a much greater risk of making mistakes.You might be arguing that modern interfaces are fast enough but I would most certainly disagree. Everyone has their own personal preferences and not all programs adhere to that. A lot of contextswitching is necessary given the plethora of different GUITUI designs out there. Every little bit of fiddling different key combos mouse behavior syntax adds up. Its the reason why people do things like fit vimlike bindings to so many programs except even then youll have to fix exceptions like i.Having a faster workflow is about decreasing the amount of friction between your thoughts and what the machine ends up doing. The slower the interface the more likely youll be distracted by trivialities how do I do x? and the greater your chance of losing sight of the big picture is x a good idea? how does x interact with y?OP has done some smart things to make sure he is spending less time fighting his interface and more time actually working. Although I have my own personal preferences and I disagree with the  keyboard choice and mouse is just slower statement.,linux,cre2k6w,13,t5_2qh1a

NonUbuntu users could still use the Ubuntu app store if their distro is compatible with its apps and Ubuntu users can uses different app stores.Michael HallSo Im not sure how else to interpret that other than While main snappy repos are exclusive to canonical you can still have a mixed system using .deb files or whatever you want.

Plus low latency is not RTSo lets see if this lines up with your expectations of trading a lot of throughput for deadline guarantees.

4078100,0,t1_criweld,gt Ads are the way that most of the web is financed though.And its wrong. It preys on the apathy andor ignorance of people. Its responsible for all spam on the Internet. Its responsible for malware ransomware adware and a host of other attacks on computing. Ever since JS reached critical mass marketing firms have used it to divine as much information as possible from a users browser and sell it to the highest bidder who then uses it to send even more ads to the users.If you want a website you have to pay for hosting and domain registration. Or maybe just the registration since you have your own machines to host with. Those costs can be high for a company. Thats the cost of doing business plain and simple. These corporations should be selling a product or service instead of leeching information from their visitors and selling it to advertisers. Thats a breach of privacy security and trust that should not go unnoticed.If websites decided to start putting up pay walls sure itd suck. But itd be fair since theyd likely have some preview content or grant access to anything older than  months or whatever. And to top it off they may have a  hour trial period so you could back out and get a refund if you wanted. Stuff like that....Huh. Thats starting to sound a lot like porn sites. You know why there are so many porn sites? Theyre pretty profitable. They sell something people want and are willing to pay for.Perhaps if websites want to stay afloat and make a profit they should offer something that people are willing to pay for.Hell this new model could be used with existing providers. Remember the old fake ad where Comcast offered access to websites and certain packages? How about instead of selling access to the actual domains and IPs they worked with those websites to roll the cost of accessing that content into your service price. Imagine paying mo for standard Internet access and access to Netflix HBO and other providers for no extra charge. Lets say Comcast strikes a deal with another provider like the New York Times or something. You pay an extra dollar for paid service to NYT instead of just  days of news you get access to all their archives.And when you sign up for service you get to select the paid services you want extra access to. You could still look at them like you can today but not necessarily have access to the exclusive stuff.It could certainly turn the Web to shit but in a different way. And itd favor smaller more independent content creators who arent out to make a buck. Anyway my point is that there are better business models than advertising. They may be strange and less convincing because they need development but personally Id rather have an adfree Web that I pay for specific websites than everything for free with tons of tracking.Clarification Im in no way supporting outright blocking of websites until you pay your ISP for access. Itd be more like Okay you pay us for Internet but since youre doing business with us MetArt has a partnership with us giving you access to any of their work as long as youre our customer. Thats a yr value! You could still access whatever they had free through any other provider and if they had a partnership theyd offer something similar.

Actually even along that line FIFA would be a big one if they could get it since I think it would be great when you can use what ever controller you want.

From  ACIDcompliant databases to web browsers and editors like Vim they all do more than one thing and often synergisticly in conjunction with other programs and libraries like SSL. Requiring that an editor must not include a spell checker but should use the spell command instead is simply userhostile.  And how did the guy post his blog? With ed and curl the Unix way or did he use a monolithic monster browser?And requiring that databases should store everything in flat file text files is simply sheer madness.  And how about .flac music files? Shouldnt they be in text format so you can use ed the one true editor to edit them?The point is that the Unix philosophy was developed at a time where computing was done entirely different than today. The Unix philosophy is simply just a collection of what did we learn and here are some wise words about it rather than an extremely inflexible doctrine.

Editing configuration file by hand and restartingreloading running daemon is exactly the thing we have done to change running service configuration for last  or something years. Its unpredictablegt Try to find the answer to which units are going to be started on next boot?gt As a sysadmin when I reboot a system I want to be able to ask is foo going to start up after a reboot?. I want to know with reasonable confidence what the state of my system is going to be when it comes onto the network.As we already know these questions are not easy to answer because dynamic nature of contemporary hardware and servers software environment may cause some units to start one time and not another.But the real question is why would you care about units that are going to be started whether foo is going to be started and about state of your system when it comes onto network?.Your server is here to provide some service and the only thing you care about is whether it provides that service or not. systemd ensures that service is started when it is needed.If you have reasonable suspicion that service in question might have trouble starting you should take your server offline and debug it in strictly controlled environment.So this is very good example of I have always done X and I want to know how to do X in this new environment which is pretty poor question to ask. Instead you should tell why do you want X  then we can talk about this problem in context of systemd and provide preferred solution. Its priorities are warpedgt One of the features of systemd is that it allows you to boot a system without needing a shell at all.I am not sure where did he get the list of systemd features or priorities.Shellfree bootup is listed as one of systemd features on Poetterings blog That table contains almost  rows and there are two more tables which contains  rows together. On that page there are over  features total. I would like to know why did this guy pick this one and not any other. And if he really wants to prov that systemd priorities are upsidedown he should  go through that list onebyone BTW there are some lowhanging fruits like Graphical UI or Plymouth integration. That thing aside I believe that Poetterings systemd for Administrators series is much more representative in telling what authors of systemd thinks are features or priorities.gt The use case often cited for this is managing services inside a container. I dont see why the init on my desktop needs to be complicated and restricted for the sake of a feature used by a minority of people with specialised use cases.The good old I dont have use for that feature so it should have not been implemented.Containers are currently the big thing in server market. Their inclusion in systemd only shows that systemd is not desktoporiented. But its eventdriven nature makes it the very good init for desktops anyway.gt One particularly bizarre feature that breaks expectations for users of pretty much any other software is that FOO is wordsplit into multiple arguments whereas FOO isnt.Surprisingly I agree with this one. If you are going to implement basic shell syntax parser it should be compatible with shell syntax. FOO in systemd shouldnt do something else than FOO in shell does.In introductory historical note as well as here and there during article there is one more point that should be covered. Author claims that toolset that is designed to work together is superior to toolset that contains of independently developed pieces. This is highly subjective topic and I think that both sides have some pretty strong arguments. Maybe it all boils down to preferences. What is important is that Linux was always set of independently developed projects that were knit together and the way that systemd does not integrate with rest of the stack is consistent with Linux way.But I would like to note few more things. I have heard that Plan adheres to Unix philosophy better than System V itself. I have heard that Hurd design is cleaner than Linux. I have heard that microkernels are superior to monolithic kernels. And I have seen Linux dominating embedded server and supercomputer space. So maybe Linux does something right after all.,linux,cs7dh9t,25,t5_2qh1a
4273857,0,t1_cs7d10e,Theres more than can go wrong than ABI compatibility. For example Apache changed tons of stuff in how config files are written between . and . not to mention the obvious ABI breaks. Yes those major updates do matter because RHEL  has official support for upgrading between major RHEL releases now so the packages have to be able to handle major updates as well. gt Youre relegating the rpm to just getting the filesystem ready for when they do a restart.RPM specifies more capabilities than just putting files in their destination so you cant impose this sort of limitation. Im not aware of any package manager that doesnt include and depending on the package heavily use the scripting capabilities. I guess my point is that the all the major distros include this automatic restart logic. I cant imagine that they all happened on this common logic without some deliberation.

I mean the real Mir still isnt shipping on base Ubuntu because of technical complications and their distributions plans and deliverable dates are in the same timeframe as Wayland.

I suggest you look at it.gt The extra granularity will do nothing against a kernel vulnerability but it will take a ton of time and will probably be a huge pain to maintain.A kernel vulnerability would hit AppArmor as well and isnt the class of operations any MAC system is designed to actually control. A kernel vulnerability wouldnt really touch whatever MAC system you were running.gt I dont know what you mean apparmor can sometimes help or how its for average users.Because of the problems Im talking about. SELinux can express a specific policy rather easily considering what the referenced task is trying to accomplish I mean. For average users I was meaning people who dont deal with security clearance data where the lack of MLS is pretty much a nonstarter.gt SELinux and Apparmor also appeared right around the same time.No it wasnt introduced to the public at large until  when it was included in the mainline kernel. Basically nobody knew anything about it until Hey were the NSA heres a bunch of code happened. I remember seeing Immunix et al back in  or so. Looking at the wiki page it says both were started around the same time but just from my personal experience nobody knew about SELinux until it was committed. Versus AppArmor which was a popular patchset similar to grsecurity for a while and then eventually got into the vanilla kernel.gt Its not so much file paths as it is the fact that Apparmor permissions mirror unix permissions in a way that would be very easy to understand.Youre talking about two different things here. Your original comment said that using file paths made it simpler as a way of explaining why using file paths was necessary. My response in what you quoted was saying using file paths makes it different in terms of complexity but it doesnt make it simpler. I still think its simpler to group objects and actors by type rather than talking about particular paths.The use of file paths was just because the concept of type enforcement wasnt popularized until SELinux came out. Using file paths was probably just the only way they could visualize doing this.gt The difference between my CVE and yours is that mine is due to profile complexity the mmap protection overreach in profiles and yours is due to implementation in the software itself.I dont really get how this distinction runs into something admins will experience but you can look at what Dan Walsh has to say on the subject if youre not  on what that CVE is actually saying. The long and short of it is that it was a distributionlevel error where they just didnt check for a particular capability. It wasnt OMG there are so many moving parts I dont know whats going on!?!?! It was just a check that didnt happen.If were concerned about distros making errors in their MAC policies heres one for AppArmorgt Im really not. Im talking about the administrative task of setting up and dealing with profiles.Then why did you link to something thats obviously not related to sysadmin work?gt And yet the reputation of complexity persists.Because people refuse to stop saying its hard. Thats all it is. SELinux policy had some serious issues starting out especially when they started with strict which hurt its reputation but once they found an acceptable default policy its pretty much resolved most issues. There are tweaks here and there occassionally but I cant remember the last time Fedora actually changed their base policy. People just refuse to give it a second chance and ISVs always just robotically tell people to turn it off even if its not causing any problems.You can get into hardmode with SELinux like with most things but you can say the same for AppArmor as well. iptables can get pretty complex if youre doing a lot of stuff in it but that doesnt make iptables more complex it just means the admin is doing something very particular on the machine which makes the firewall policy complex.But like I said before Ill admit that in some vague sense SELinux might be a little more complex than AppArmor insofar as theres terminology to learn but none of it is really rocket science.,linux,csvgz7f,4,t5_2qh1a

Finally Debian is stable. Id argue that Debian is the largest OS in the world both in terms of number of packages and LOC shipped. A release once every  years for a product as large and complex yet as robust and stable as Debian is amazing.,linux,cszhj5v,9,t5_2qh1a

4560659,0,t3_3dial0,I dont think its so much the open source paradigm as open source licensing. Open source licenses typically allow for redistribution with very few limiations. This allows open source operating systems to create pools repositories of software and tools to install the software in those pools. This makes it easy for distributions to create central solutions.Windows and Mac OS X are designed to be more of a platform you can install thirdparty software on rather than an allinone centrally provided solution.Its possible to set up App storesrepositories on nonfree systems. Just look at iOS as an example. But it does raise more licensing issues and doesnt fit as well with the typical business model of closed source systems.,linux,ct5hl0l,3,t5_2qh1a

And youre correct in that the language couldnt trigger a GPL violation. Those specific words shouldnt have been brought up. Im inclined to bet someone just did it to have the FSF come in and make a statement but I dont know when it started.I was just trying to make the point that the real danger is the noncopyleft code as you state. Ubuntu still cant reasonably claim anything to license in that. But Ubuntus legal team unfortunately didnt and still doesnt make a proper distinction between trademark and software licensing in their statement. Its all kind of mashed together which makes it hard to see which clauses apply where. Because of that youre technically required to recompile anything thats not GPL.Ideally theyd update the wording to just state the need to recompile only packages containing trademarked materials and listing those packages. But the entire organization has been remarkably obtuse about this concern. A good software lawyer should have been able to resolve it in a few months tops.Its baffling to see that it hasnt been properly acknowledged and addressed for this long.

As soon as you get something that doesnt create SELinux labels automatically as they should be and believe you me youll get there the end user is fucked unless he knows what hes doing.Actually when the shit hits the fan SELinux is a pain in the ass I.E. if the AVC database gets corrupted happened to me twice its something non technical users cant fix. Actually most of the people I know dont use enforcing SELinux on their own computers. gt Linux has really powerful security mechanism. Windows has reduced permission capabilities but only a fraction of system services use it and you cant not practically apply them to arbitrary applications since most of the break and make gigantic assumptions about all kinds of system behaviuor that can never change since MSFT is unwilling to be blamed for the issue it would cause.

I say without a doubt that Linux is the best operating system available right now by technical standards and by a lot.

Maliciousness of code can be hard to determine and any reasonably trustworthy review is not easy. I dont think Mozilla has resources to do trustworthy reviews without long waits.I can only think of two solutions at the moment Some kind of sandboxing which prevents addons from doing bad things. The problem is that this would limit functionality which addons actually need. Installing addons via AMO without an extensive security check. Addons would become available quickly but they could be malicious. The fact that the install went via AMO would just mean that Mozilla is in a better position to examine maliciousness after the fact deactivate them and prevent future downloads.,linux,ctygppn,0,t5_2qh1a

What prevents them from forking it or starting from scratch?Also there is only one music player for the Linux desktop isnt a state that can be reached from the current state. There is no standardsetting body for this case so every standard is only worth something if enough people follow it voluntary.And you cant really compare music players with programming languages. Its much easier to write a fairly well functioning music player than to create a serious competitor of C. Also a new programming language needs a large enough ecosystem around it bindings libraries and programs written in it to be attractive to its potential users i.e. application and library developers. A music player doesnt need that so its much easier for a user to switch to a new music player than to switch to a new programming language.,linux,ctzbeqy,3,t5_2qh1a

Qemu can be used to emulate a wide variety of cpu architectures. So you can use Qemu to launch a ARM VM if you want.HOWEVER.. Qemu can also be used in user mode. So this means you can use qemu to execute software for different architectures without the use of a full fledged virtual machine.  That is you can do stuff like qemu armbinbash and execute a ARM binary on x Linux. and visa versaThis means that it should be possible to setup a full fledged ARM install of  Arch Debian or Fedora  container environment on you x workstations so you can build and execute ARM binaries natively in a dockerlxcetc container. ,linux,cu0n22i,1,t5_2qh1a

I wrote an article on why all the AOO arguments IBM were making as the reason for their own existence were specious years ago Im actually surprised IBM gave up and reassigned everyone already. It is too bad I had hoped that when the merger happened that IBM would have a lot to bring to the table. You also have to consider that opportunity cost of how IBM got pissy.CADT issue doesnt really apply to LibreOffice. This is nothing like Gnome . They arent rewriting code a lot of what they are doing is cleaning it up. Even so the problem of CADT goes away with more resources. It seems like there is attention deficit the actual problem is that people are too busy because there is too much to work on and things fall through the cracks.

They cant get around it because thats the license and they dont want to violate it themselves.  Its not just the people they ship to. They ship it so the license is in effect for grsecurity as well. So why does the gresecurity team think that not releasing patches is going to have a big impact on these noncooperative embedded corporations?  Why bother with this at all? Well here is the second part you are not getting because the people that do the shit that piss grsecurity off are incompetent They very simply dont know what the fuck they are doing OR are unable due to some issue like corporate culture to release products that are sane and are of high quality.  This means that not having easy access to well structured patches is enough of a technical barrier. They are so utterly clueless that by the time they figure out to get their hands on the source code and extract a good enough diff to use in their own hackedtofuck products that they are going to be so far behind the curve that its a waste of time. Also it means that they cant just use grsecurity trademarks with the excuse we are using your patches untouched. Now grsecurity will ship a entire kernel not just patch sets and they can tie their trademark restrictions into that. Which is part of what Redhat does. Needless to say if you try to depend on a secure product that doesnt comply with the GPL or license with grsecurity it is not definitive proof that their products are a pile of shit but its a enormous sign that they are..,linux,cugx842,23,t5_2qh1a

4996630,0,t3_3jczpp,Apple creates all their software themselves. AFAIR Nokia had a couple times more people working on their software than Apple had. So Apple makes all their software OSX iOS iWork etc. with a comparatively small workforce. Small teams can sometimes with the right management get a lot done in software developement. So Xiaomi could just as well take the Linux kernel and their billion dollars and do everything they want with it. Since they are an Android company they might include an Android emulator for running Android apps in Windows perhaps? Why not with a touchscreen?. They could create their own office suite or polish up LibreOffice. Though I think we would have heard of that by now because LibreOffice has a very transparent developement process. A sudden influx of Chinese developers and code would have been noticed. Except if they went Apple style and simply took the product work on it in secret for x months and then do a huge code dump. But that is not Xiaomi style. As much as they want to emulate Apples success their own success stems from the community and the feedback. I dont think they would throw that away. Then there are alternatives. Gnome with Abiword? If they polish up the filters for MS Office exchange? Then there is KDE with Calibre. Or they could simply include a proprietary office suite like Kingsoft or Softmaker. A lot of things are possible. Especially if they do it right.

Whats a problem are for instance things like skypelinux or Musicbrains Picard which cant run without a GUI for no real reason. And systemd itself which cant run without a plethora of things and pulls in a plethora of things for no apparent reason.Try running systemd without consolekitlike functionality it isnt possible what if you have absolutely no use whatsoever for determining seats and spots like if you run a singleuser computer or a server.

I dont have details on this but IIRC Canonical has heavily patched some packages needed to produce their font rendering freetype cairo probably others.That said Ubuntus patched rendering is still absolutely terrible  I was never able to produce a satisfactory fontrendering without infinalitybundled by bohoomil Sadly Infinality himself stopped working on this and he was the only one producing Fedora packages so for all I know Arch is the only operating system that can render readable fonts ,linux,cuw1i1o,-1,t5_2qh1a

And now with mainstream households appliances running pretty much full blown operating system it wouldnt surprise me if the install base for Linux were larger than that of all other kernels combined. People can handle OS installs just fine. My wife just reinstalled OS X on her mini my graphics  ux designer just finished installing windows  on a bunch of workstations and the installers for user friendly distros like Mint or Ubuntu are no more difficult to use than either of those. People arent stuck theyre just not seeing the point of spending an hour on this when their current system works just fine. Windows and OS X rule the desktop and will do so for the foreseeable future at least until something comes along that is more disruptive than Ubuntu or ChromeOS or FirefoxOS. Its not enough to be about as good as the leaders in order to really win the desktop OS war you need to be twice as good and also somehow counter the existing lockin strategies all that without a truly convincing profit model freemium paid support donations selling hardware adsponsored all of these either dont work at all or theyre ethically questionable. In terms of UX and usability for everyday desktop use none of the existing free operating systems is good enough they pay off in terms of freedom and ethics and also for more techsavvy users who can play the strengths of a Unixbased system but for the average user OS X and even Windows turna out to get them what they want with less hassle.,linux,cvcc3l7,5,t5_2qh1a

The answers are really easy to come by. When you just demand that others do the work for you you dont actually contribute anything to the community. That means that not many people are actually motivated to help you know? This is particularly annoying when the answers are quite easily found with a simple web search.To explainpip is a package manager for python packages like apt or yum are in Debian or RedHatbased distros. Sometimes the program you want to install is not included in the packages of a linux distribution  many reasons no one submitted it its not tested the distribution tries to keep things stable by not updating as often except for security etc. Of course since its your system you can of course violate the principles of your distribution and install software.Pip helps you do that for python packages.

Filter out IP addresses that can access port  and the Terraria port if you want and deny access to other IPs. This may not be an option if you are accessing the server from a dynamic IP. But its an option. You can use iptables for this or ufw if youre on Ubuntu or firewalld if youre on a CentOS server.You also have the option of using something like FailBan which will ban IP addresses after theyve attempted to connect more than a certain number of times in a certain timespan.

5383356,0,t1_cvyg98f,gt Its possible but awkward to do so on the ones Ive seen  where every time you boot theres a good chance itll wipe your Linux and reset to just Chrome.Perhaps this might help?I guess what youre alluding to is using crouton which installs another distros filesystem chroots into it and ensures smooth interoperability with ChromeOSs various daemons which control power audio etc.Before you do this you need to put your chromebook into dev mode which gives you a proper bash shell in the chromeos terminal from where you can do everything elseProblem is at bootup theres a potentially misleading screen telling the uninitiated that security is off press space to reestablish it. So if they do press space the partition holding the chromeos filesystem gets reimaged.And away goes your chroots as well.You could install your chroots on an sd card or usb stick and thats fine but if you want to have it on your internal ssd then how do you safeguard your chroot?Well ... Repartition your ssdUse the chrubuntu or chrx script to repartition your ssd. These scripts are intended to create a proper dualboot chromeosubuntu installation. Stage  of that is to repartition the ssd in such a way so that the chromebook does not think its broken you need to be careful if doing it manually.So just use one of those scripts just for repartitioning and dont bother with the dualboot installation. Install your crouton chroot into that partition.Inside chromeos bash just mount that partition on top of usrlocalchroots and install crouton. Safe from CtrlD disaster?In a word yes. When you switch from dev mode to nondev mode and vice versa  the ssd is NOT repartitioned that only happens if you boot from a speciallymade recovery stick. The existing partition used for chromeos userspace is reimaged thats all.So if your machine is accidentally switched out of devmode  you havent really lost anything. Just switch back remount your chroots partition and youre back to where you were.,linux,cvzs8vz,1,t5_2qh1a

5559587,0,t1_cwm474u,gtsyslog is available in the initramfs if you use dracut.  That is guarantied to lead to lost logentries when transitioning to rootfs. It is a kernel limitation that only one program can read devlog or messages will be lost.  There are other problems too. I dont think I have ever seen an distro enabling syslog in initramfs as default something which would be a good idea to do if it actually worked. I mean who wouldnt like better logging from early boot.  As I understand it you pretty much have to design a sysloghelper program like journald in order to get all messages logged to devkmsg and devlog during boot.    gtGranted regular expressions can seem like magic to some   The vast majority of Linux user IMHO. Regular expressions are great and powerful but only a fraction of Linux users can use them to any significant degree. Not only are there regular expressions there are also extended regular expressions and each and ever program seems to have some maddening variant of the above. You really have to work with regexes on a daily basis in order to use them with any confidence.  With regard to syslog logfiles the best evidence of how hard regexes are and how few master them are the fact that the logentries are split up into many smaller logfiles each covering eg. a single daemon. If Linux users were confident regex users this ought not to be necessary but the fact is that even many seasoned Linux SAs arent terrible good at making regex adhoc queries. Newbies dont stand a chance at all so at best they read the logfiles with less.  In that regard journalctl is major improvement when it comes to filtering the logs. Even newbies seems to quickly catch up to using stuff like journactl b  p warning show all log entries from the previous boot with syslog priority warning and above or using journalctl u smartd.service. Both examples of useful and powerful filtering that is quite hard to do with regex but simple with journalctl.  gtI suppose journald supports this as well correct?  Yep and much improved over syslog too like being able to export rich metadata using JSON etc. Of course you dont open the logfiles directly with an editor but use the Unix concept of piping if you for some rather obscure reason need to export logs into an editor. So no problems there.  And IMHO using editors for viewing logs is simply just so wrong that it hurts at least use less. But I understand why people doing it they simply dont have the skills to filter using regex.   People with small systems may like text logs but flat file unstructured syslog text logs simply dont scale at all and are painful to aggregate. This is why every enterprise logcollector and analyzing software I have seen like Splunk logstash etc all are doing what journald does namely hammering the logdata into a defined structure and making an index.   The list over the many problems with flat file syslog text logs is extremely long like not being programmatically accessible no index no defined structure no rich metadata like monotonic timestamps etc. The Rsyslog project started exactly because it wanted to overcome the many deficiencies with the syslog interface and flat text logs back in .,linux,cwm7ugm,3,t5_2qh1a

Falling for Linux was a defining moment in my career I still remember the first night I was able to get it online in my dorm room over  years ago. Linux changed everything for me it made me a better programmer it taught me many sysadmin skills and became an immensely marketable skill. I eventually landed at a major open source company and Im thankful every day for that. Still cant believe what people are paid in this field.That drive to tinker and experiment and learn with a computer is invaluable. Open source is one of the best examples of human nature I can think of. It is orders if magnitude more secure and better suited for an enthusiast to learn.

5669905,0,t3_3srz0s,ZFS has very sophisticated integrated RAM and SSD caching LARC that can be configured for caching random or random and sequential reads. If an SSD cache is useful depends largely on your workload. There also is a write intent log that is basically a cache for writes but its usefulness also depends on workload. I have found that for my usecase ZFS doesnt use the LARC SSD at all no cache hits only misses and RAMARC caching is sufficient for random IO. For sequential IO the SSD has about the same throughput as my  disk raidz so I wouldnt get any benefit from that either.Raidz is probably not optimal with your number of discs. the number of effective storage disks should always be n so if you were to use raidz you would need  or  disks or if you were to use raidz which Id highly suggest youd be fine with  or  disks. If you would use a raidz with  disks in practice youd lose some of you  disks of effective storage to alignment issues and suffer a minor performance impact. Youd be better off with  disks  usable and  parity if you were to run a raidz.The alternative to raidz is just striping an arbitrary mount of mirrored disks basically the equivalent of raid. Youd have  mirrors of  disks each giving you TB of effective storage with no further losses in performance or space. This is actually the suggested method for most usecases today because it is very easily extendable. You can always put in more mirrored vdevs that further data will be striped on. Extending a raidz in ZFS is impossible except if you turnbyturn replace each disk with a larger one and rebuild which is going to take ages with a large array. It is not possible to reshape the array change the number of disks like it is with mdadm! Once you have set it up you have to stick with the number of disks.If you really need the features only btrfs and zfs provide checksumming snapshots sendreceive etc. Id suggest definitely using the native RAIDs of those filesystems because apart from the increased complexity you will lose some features if you use additional methods like mdadmRAID and bcache. For example you will be able to detect corrupted data but the FS will only be able to automatically correct that data if you use the internal RAID functionality.,linux,cwzwoeu,12,t5_2qh1a

5687772,0,t1_cx1z2wz,Yes I see...its about gtk having language bindings while Qt integrates javascript...I can see how the bindings can be an advantage in some cases. Not sure if I agree with the signal and callback mechanisms being nicer...but thats maybe because I come from the others side. Defining properties and signals is just so damn nice in the c code on the Qt side.    class myClass  public QObject                QOBJECT            QPROPERTYQString someText READ getText WRITE setText NOTIFY textChanged            public                void setTextconst QString ampnewText  myText  newText emit textChanged                 QString getText const  return myText             signals                void textChanged            private                QString myText    Allows easy accessing from QML and even creates all callbacks needed for getting notified about changes I never have to bother myself with them inside qml. And what I really like a lot is that it works the same for own classes...makes exporting a whole data structure very easy. Downside is of course  that your classes need to inherit QObject and it only gets exported to QML and...you use it with Javascript inside QML. You dont get pure javascript code.   Afraid the class example I dont really understand...is there anything special I miss out? I just use javescript code in qml...class are done the same there just with the addition of the qml structures for gui elements.Theming support is actually pretty nice in QT in my view nowadays they have the Qt Style Sheets which are kind of CSS for QML and c code. The only basic widgets is still true to some extend it are a lot more widgets than two years ago but its still mostly the basics. And I am not sure if that will ever really change...it seems the idea is more to move completely to qml and not expose every previous c widget but rather use qml widgets libraries and let the user build their own widgets from basic elements. Guess it depends on ones needs if that is an advantage or disadvantage...but if you prefer having as much of the gui in the scripting language I think it makes sense to add new widgets through qml and not c code...you always have the choice to extend your qml widgets with c code if wanted or needed. Qt is more or less two systems at the moment...the old c widget classes which will probably be supported indefinitely but not get extended very much and the new QML stuff. I am for sure no expert there but for me it looks like they try to make a pretty clear cut there...its not simply exposing the c classes the QML but rather having a own consistent QML system that can get access the the c widget classes if really needed but then with the help of some c glue code...but also can work completely on its own with widget sets mainly defined on QML. In that sense you really hardly need any c code nowadays for many applications gui and general logic can be done inside in QML with javascript. For a simple applications all that is needed in c is the main application that starts the qml engine. Database access networking gui properties openGL basic logic can be all done in javascript. You need c if you want to extend your program beyond the scope of Qt of course..but I assume that is the same everywhere.The usage of javescript libraries you mention is a really inserting point. You can import javascript libraries in qml but I have to admit I never used this so far and have no clue how well it works and if it can be made work with external libraries. Having javascript language bindings is clearly an advantage there rather than using javascript as internal scripting language.Overall..thanks I really never considered gtk as alternative to Qt when it comes to using in javascript but it clearly has some advantages in some cases it seems. Overall I think I still like the tight integration of QML better as it feel more natural and makes a lot things easier without having to rely on cc code. Seems for a javascript application that needs a gui gtk might be the better choice while for an application that wants its gui written in a scripting language Qt might be better. Guess I am too much stuck in the later to really ever consider the former case.edittypos,linux,cx24g8d,2,t5_2qh1a

5716682,0,t1_cx4rn8d,You technically can however if youre using any kind of orchestration like Mesos to deploy your instances you have to be very very careful with how many instances you have and where their data is pointing at.For instance if Im using MySQLMariaDB etc and Im not using MyISAM in a very specific highly discouraged configuration I can only have one mysql pid pointed at one set of data files at once otherwise you get data corruption. Also you then have to work out clustering if you need the capacity most of which dont do auto discovery well some do Elasticsearch being an example and Cassandra being designed to run at scale but most RDBMS arent. Galera doesnt which is what we use.Also your orchestration layer has to be aware of what storage is local and what isnt. The MesosMarathon version Im using does not so you run into instances where a docker host dies and I have the recovery options set properly but the orchestration layer wont migrate the image because it doesnt realize that the volumes arent local to the dead docker host.This is a lot of question marks to have with what is typically your most valuable resource i.e. your data which is also the least easy to recreate. Docker is great for the parts of your environment that are ephemeral like your app if a container blows up throw it away and fire up another moderately good for things that are semipermiable i.e. redis memcache etc where losing the data would be an annoyance but not catastrophic things designed to run in a cluster configuration cassandra elasticsearch etc and not great for transactional data aka MySQLMariaDBPostgres.Most places I see run their most critical and stateful services still in vertically scaled vms and treat them like pets edge load balancerstransactional databasesDNSetcdconsulzookeeperorchestrationstuff like that while anything that needs to scale horizontally goes in dockerorchestration.

Time is money in the end. If you deliver code that is marginally more performant at the cost of having your coworkers take way longer to understand it thats a bad idea.edit Okay fired is excessive you will be told to not do it any more if you continue to do it you will be fired.gt As I said whitespace and commentings are free.Whitespace and commenting do not make incomprehensible algorithms that rely on low level repreaesentations and binary hacks understandable.gt If a person cannot explain it then they do not understand what they are doing. Just because one person does not understand what is happening does not mean its undocumentable or unreadable.Guess what most people who implement fast inverse square root dont understand it. You just know the magic constant you know how fisr is implemented and that it works but you dont bother with the actual floating point logic behind it.Youre paid to write code not to spend your time trying to understand how fisr actually works. Its a giant hack that was needed at the time that doesnt even work any more with  bit floats.gt The original code appears quite readable and maintainable to me. Its merely bithacking in order to produce a reliable result.No its not. Im sorry but no one who has never heard of fisr understands what the relevant line of    i   xfdf   i gtgt                  what the fuck? Is actually doing why its there and what it exactly does. You understand it does some bizarre bit level operation and you leave it at that. This would a terrible coding practice if the performance wasnt direly needed and if the performance was not so hugely significant but only marginal they wouldve never resorted to it.No one who does not already know what fisr is can understand this function and what it does.gt Below that shows how the bithacking works.Quite right it explains the maths behind it in  long paragraphs. If you need  long paragraphs to explain one line of code unless in the most dire of need that one line is a terrible coding practice. Thats why the original comment was just what the fuck? and left it at that because the author knew there was no sense in attempting to explain it to future readers.gt Again just because one person didnt understand what was going on does not mean its unreadable nor unmaintainable.Yes it is Im sorry but if there is a bug in that one quintessential line say the magic constant is off by a fraction due to a typo no one who does not know about fisr will be able to fix it.Do you honestly claim that if you never heard of fisr and saw that code except there was a bug in it due to magic constant being off or the bit shift accidentally going into the wrong direction and someone told you This code is bugged please find out what is wrong and fix it that youd have a clue as to where even start?That code is utterly and utterly unmaintainable. If it stops working on some machine with a different internal float rep and its handed to someone who does not know what it is that person will be unable to figure out why it stopped working and why it originally worked to begin with from just looking at that code its a completely unmaintainable hack.,linux,cxrbov2,6,t5_2qh1a

Arch users are wilfull slaves who do not care about their own system and allow themselves to be shepherded along by their slavemasters who make absofuckinglutely no guarantees of the future and just do whatever the fuck they want forcing all their users to go along. Arch entire design makes it next to impossible to not accept a change forced down your throat from above. They will change whatever the fuck they want about their system with no real notice and rarely support any alternatives.Especially KDE ties nicely into this they at one point just decided to upgrade their shit from KDE to KDE. KDE is not backwards compatible with  but hey this is Arch it has a higher version number so its better. Not only did the upgrade break things left and right but KDE is not in the repos as an alternative they just have KDE. KDE might as well be considered a fork of KDE. But I guess because it carries the same branding Arch devs thought it okay to force that change onto their users.In general the package manager is retarded the system tools are retarded and everything about Arch lags behind more serious projects like Debian or Gentoo. How fucking long did it take for Arch to get package signing when Debian had it years before? How long was Pacmans interface not separated from its implementation. Pacman still has no facility to configure licences.Furthermore Arch packages are fucking bloated. Debian devs are nice enough to split up packages in normal dev and debug packages. Arch basically always gives you debug with all the bloat and all the dependencies turned on because the devs are fucking lazy and do not fucking care.

Changing the formal settings putting the Ubuntugrub stuff in a generic boot folder renaming folders to sort in a different alpha order so that Ubuntu would come before Microsoft...all were a bust in terms of preventing a direct boot to Windows . But then I tried making sure the Microsoft  boot  whatever.efi files were backed up within that tree then overwriting them with my grub files. Presto. My HP will load grub only because I wrote this is totally the Windows bootloader in sharpie on the side of it. I also have an entry for Windows in grub originally it was manual but I think Ive been using bootrepair to generate it the last few times. It doesnt experience any complications loading Windows  at the moment. I dont have thorough documentation of what it is exactly has been overwritten sometimes its more or less force paste everything from the  Ubuntu or  Boot folder into the Microsoft boot folder mimic filenames if that doesnt work and dont ask too many questions. I still have to reperform this task occasionally if Ive been using Windows  at all.

6014580,0,t1_cy6tnaq, They switched from having one button per window to one icon per application removed the window title text and then made the window switcher shuffle the windows around every time you try to switch. This makes it almost impossible to find the window you want if you have multiple similar looking windows open. For example more than one terminal more than one text file or more than one PDF. They removed the hierarchical launcher menu and replaced it with a very slow search system where the results reorder themselves continuously. As a result it is impossible to ever learn where things are. The same goes for the HUD. The global menu. Does anything more need to be said? The menu is now guaranteed to be further away from your mouse pointer than it was before unless your window is maximized then its in almost exactly the same place. The whole UI now has animated fades and slides where before things would just happen instantly.,linux,cy81ew4,4,t5_2qh1a

The reason distros were writing AppArmor profiles on their own is because the developers still arent into it but if it ever gains adoption you would expect that the developer of any new program would write their own security profile or otherwise this program wouldnt run on the machine of end users.Perhaps a GUI tool could configure aspects of an AppArmor profile but now you have a problem you need a way to communicate the application that they are running with some permission it normally uses disabled.

You just typed the command and ran it in the background with the amp command.I thought in the classic world daemons put themselves in the background by doubleforking to disassociate themselves from the current users session?gt To stop a service you killed a service by issuing a kill command to kill the process. The program should cleanup and exit gracefully. It was literally that simple.Which only worked if you knew the daemons pid. Thus the horrible concept of pid files was born...Of course most things didnt check if they actually killed the right thing or if the pid was reused by some other process.It also only works for singleprocess daemons or in the case of multiprocess services when the main process is happy enough to clean up its children and the children then their own children if they exist.That is it is a system that only really works when nothing goes wrong.

6123005,0,t3_3zf620,Got to love the pretentiousness of audio folks. gt This approachtwo sound cards one dedicated to music the other left to generalpurpose audio choreshas some great advantages. First it meets our goal of having a streamlined and bit perfect audio pipeline dedicated to playing music.Which turns your Linux desktop audio experience into a basket case.  A great number of problems people experience with Linux audio comes directly from trying to fiddle around things like alsamixer while trying to use Pulseaudio or trying to use Pulseaudio on a Distro that ships with it nonfunctional out of the box ie Debian  or listening to really bad advice about OSSv and trying to switch back and forth between things. All it really amounts most of the time is people spending a great deal of time and effort spent turning your audio setup into a nightmare.  Its difficult to undo the damage you get from this sort of approach. And what is more is that you are really eliminating a great deal of functionality you can get from Linux audio. Namely the ability to switch back and forth seemlessly between different audio outputs and hotplug devices including network streams.This way you dont have to stop and restart your audio applications whenever you want to switch inputs.  This way you can do things like... unplug your usb from your laptop close the laptop lid go somewhere sit down open up your laptop and plug in your usb audio out and have it all just work. gt Why the Schiit Fulla digitaltoanalog converter?The proper term for this is USB audio card. Giving it a different label does not mean its any better then anything else available from a  different vendors.  That being said I am a big fan of usb audio cards for headphones.  The internal DAC and amplifier included in laptops are generally shit. They are not electronically isolated and are cheap. The internal electronic noise in any computers is a nightmare for any sort of analog circuit so moving the digital signal out to external DAC is a big win simply for the fact that its the best way to isolate the analog circuit to your head phones.What is more awesome about it is that you can run a very long usb cord and ditch any sort of headphones extension cords you may want to use.  Digital signal quality is not going to be affected by cheap andor long USB cables as long as they are in spec where as any sort of analog cabling is going to be lossy. From the specs the Schiit usb audio dongle is probably pretty good and the price is reasonable. The components are good quality.  That and a high quality pair of headphones is all you really need. You do that and you are  there. Pulseaudio can bet tweaked to give audiophile quality output without neutering your Linux systems capabilities and turning your audio into a basket case that requires micro managing.For speaker listening dont bother with a USB device or expensive card but get a nice pair of speakers and digital receiver. Do stereo out via SPDIF or HDMI to that and you are golden. That way you are relying on DAC in the digital receiver to do the conversions and the quality of audio devices on your laptopdesktop is irrelevant.,linux,cylmefp,22,t5_2qh1a

6240408,0,t1_cyyppth,As someone who runs Gentoo depends on your use case and your situation.My situation is that my computer is always on anyway its on at night because it functions as my own server anyway so letting it compile stuff with low priority doesnt matter for me. The more esoteric your needs are the more useful Gentoo also is. Compile times are usually not a problem and most packages compile within like  seconds like your average window manager or whatnot. But a couple of things like Chromium LibreOffice GCC and GHC can take hours to compile.The result? A slimmed down system with a custom kernel using alternative lowlatency schedulers which are officially supported with extraeneous userland daemons being able to be stripped out results into a very responsive very quickly booting system compared to a binary distro. This like clearly isnt a placebo any more. I have a mint system installed alongside it which shares a home partition the interface is the same but its sluggish it takes longer to boot for applications to respond and start resources are higher less RAM is free when the same stuff is open. The system dbus on a full desktop on the Gentoo system takes  K RAM it takes  G on the mint desktop.But to be able to slim it down like that also means you need to have no need for those things to begin with the less you actually need the more you can slim down. I dont use cgroups ACL polkit consolekit PAM LDAP initrams acpid avahi and a lot of other year of the linux desktop shit so I can just cut it out on Gentoo which would be next to impossible on a binary distro.

6320811,0,t1_cz82p2j,gt People often say Thats a really specific use case you cant expect people to seriously accomodate that but thats not the point the point is that your software is designed in the wrong way if you even need to accomodate specific use cases virtually everyone has some highly specific use case. So you should just provide generic frameworks so that third portable apps can be written to service it and hook onto it.The problem with your very specific use case is that instead of asking for functionality youre also demanding a specific implementation. That doesnt sit very well with most developers in principle. They have a better understanding of the codebase their problems and their roadmap than you and what you want might not be easy or good to implement.But sidestepping that your very specific use case leaves a security hole for people to exploit that affects everyone else. Its not just a hypothetical. Just two days ago a post came up about a trojan that recorded audio and took screenshots every half minute Thats the kind of thing youre asking people to leave holes for. Yes you can say that they should have been more careful but security should really be a default for users whenever possible.gt You have one generic framework on top of which all use cases related to that may be served thats the old way of designing software in Unix where you werent dependant of Oh but have the devs thought of my use case. This new way is a disease.The problem is that youre asking for people to make generic entry points with unlimited and unspecified capability into other pieces of software. Anyone with even rudimentary programming knowledge knows thats a lot easier to talk about than to actually implement. Its not just about launching binaries and granting them full hardware access. Which you can still do to make your screenshot app even though its terribly insecure. Martin Graesslin told you this on another post  if you run something as root it can still grab things from the framebuffer. Theres not really anything to stop you from that. People just dont want that to be the default approach.Youre actually asking for generic unfettered functionality to be exposed for future usage in unknown ways. The normal way to do that is through an API. You can complain about DBus but its hardly the first of its kind. Weve been down this route with COM and CORBA before. Making code accessible from outside the process is hard and youre not really helping anyone by implying it isnt. APIs and SDKs have been just as much a part of the Linux world as they have been with the Windows world. Having the full source code is great but having an API means you dont have to alter the original  you merely interface with it. And that requires targeted design to not be an absolute security clusterfuck.In essence theres nothing wrong with the functionality you want.

6323676,0,t1_cz8diwv,For discussion of the GPLv the GPLv is not particularly relevant.  Youre making your argument with the assumption that there are no bugs in the GPLv or extra clarifying language.  You might as well assume there are no bugs in computer programs.  Furthermore there is more language within the GPLv which Im not as familiar with that might deal with the apparent contradiction.  See the last paragraph of GPLv Section  for example.  That might affect the applicability of GPLv .c..  Note that this language is not in GPLv.A copyright license is an agreement regarding the use a copyrighted work.  Thats all it is.  Its a legal agreement in plain English.  To form the agreement a license must be offered by the licensor and copyright owner and must be accepted by the licensee.  A termination is the cancellation of the offer and can be challenged as there might be terms in the license regarding this ... and thus the agreement.  Thats why I said that it may be possible that licensors who are not licensees may not have to up to GPLv section  as well as the intent of the GPL continue to offer to previous violators.  However licensees as in the case of the SFC BusyBox plaintiffs are required to offer licenses to their work to all third parties.  Anyone who abides by the terms of the license is free to accept.  The term relicense has no special legal meaning other than to license again.  Thats it.IMO the SFC is abusive and on the same level as patent trolls  I do not withdraw the comparison.  Other licensors of the BusyBox license have also called the SFC action immoral.  I would agree with that as well.,linux,cz8fln5,1,t5_2qh1a

Someone posts this asking why it was removed. Said link gets silently reinstated.

Then again this post comes up asking why such a thing is happening. umasta confesses that its himher who is removing these links either directly or not reinstating the posts autoremoved by the SJWs And here we are now observing where this thing goes.Apparently this umasta is either a person who has just lost hisher marbles or one suffering from a grave mental illness that could cause such a behavior we can only guess.Another thing to note is that rather than provide an explanation of hisher sudden and weird actions umastas comments reflect an arrogance of power and seem to indicate that heshe is a person who has little interest in moderation of rlinux among all things for example Yeah call it censorship if you want... and lulz..EDITThe plot thickens.

And a minimal ubuntu is still quite a lot larger than an Alpine image.gtThere are no benefits from using musl except for the smaller size which is only possible because it omits a lot of features and useful extensions.Sure there are but you have to read about the various libc implementations to really see the benefits. musl is performant and secure. It also adheres to POSIX better than glibc. You may not consider that a feature but some do.gt It is less audited it doesnt have a dedicated security team checking it etc. All in all using musl means more bugs and fewer features for an insignificant size reduction.Thats a specious argument at best. musl is designed with security in mind and fewer lines of code beget fewer bugs.gt Yes it does but you are missing the problem completely.Not really.gtThe reason you have to use a MAC like SElinux isnt because of unknown exploits or even exploits at all but because you need something to prevent otherwise totally legal user space access to kernel features.These things are also accomplished by the various namespaces caps and seccomp.

You wont believe how many users will be standing at the threshold of your office door after you pulled an update which pulled in new major versions of packages like WebKit.Absolutely no matter what you claim here a new major version of any complex piece of software will almost always introduce regressions. Period.I have had these situations several dozen times. No matter what you update there will be one user whose particular weirdarse desktop browser mail setup etc etc will no longer work properly. Its so safe you can make bets on that.This is the main reason enterprise networks want stable releases. Because I have other things to do than fixing stupid regressions after simple daily upgrades. Luckily I will be changing jobs in two months anyway but I feel still sorry for any sysadmin who has to deal with this stuff.And since you keep comparing WebKit with Firefox aka xulrunner. Look at the reverse dependecies of packages like webkitgtk and look at the reverse dependencies of xulrunner. Now please tell me how many potential applications a major Webkit update breaks versus the number of applications that can break when updating xulrunner. Hint The answer for xulrunner is two while for even just webkitgtk the answer is already at least several dozens.We cannot upgrade WebKit the same way we can upgrade xulrunner.,linux,d06zigi,6,t5_2qh1a

There were a lot of people interested in running a cheap but functional Unix like OS on the PC and Linus made that feasible by writing the kernel that could power the GNU OS userland.The way Linus Torvalds goes for technically sound contributions without dictating a strict design and development path made and makes Linux trusted and good enough for a myriad scenarios.

Oracle doesnt want to release the keys by licensing the ZFS to a GPL compatible license. By holding the keys they want to ensure that people will violate both CDDL and GPL in order to be able to use ZFS with GPL software like linux. Once large GPL projects like linux get infiltrated with substantial nonGPL code Oracle can then troll upon people using them with copyright lawsuits the way it did with Google.

Android applications are mostly closed source but the kernel is linux.There is also plenty of kernel drivers that are binary blobs not licensed under the GPL. Just because you use Linux doesnt automatically mean everything you build is bound to the GPL.Edit Its also not the users place to enforce license violations. If they should be notifying anyone they should be politely notifying Linux and the FSF about potential violations not witch hunting and shaming on their own.Edit  Noticed the article saying The user is asked to agree to a usage right agreement  but its not necessary the software is available to anyone without requiring authentication.Shows ignorance of the law as well if there is license and you bypass it it means you are violating copyright you have no license to those materials and could be considered black hat. Reverse engineering software you dont have the legal right to use Just because its hosted on the http doesnt mean mean that you have the right to it. Everything on the internet isnt automatically public domain its all copyright even the web pages your download you can see the javascript but you cant legally copy it unless the license offered allows that.It doesnt mean that BMW isnt also violating the GPL but two wrongs dont make a right you cant forgo licensing simply because you suspect or dont like BMW.Edit  The updating over HTTP is definitely a issue but to be fair a secure mechanism could exist in other forms to prevent man in the middle attacks against firmware updates.

6839271,0,t1_d0q4cak,Linux gaming was absolutely doing well before Valve infected it with their stink.The fact that Linux games development was beginning to become more and more popular a few years ago and note that I say beginning to is the only reason valve ported steam over. They saw a chance to get in on the ground floor and monopolize the distribution platform before the Linux gaming industry really even got a strong foothold in place. The momentum was there without Steam.Did steams port increase that momentum? Yes absolutely. Would Linux gaming have been successful without them? Also yes.I switched to Linux for gaming when Windows Vista failed to run most of my games collection. Ive been gaming on linux for a lot longer than Steam has been available for the platform and several of my favorite games have had Linux native ports for a long time. The notion that Valve made linux gaming possible is silly to me. Im certainly not the only one with similar Linux gaming experience either.I dont see their role as being entirely positive. There are plenty of negatives that come with locking yourself into their distributions model but yes they have had some positive impact. Not all diseases are fatal and in this case their are sideeffects that even prove desirable. Dont be fooled though they are absolutely not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts. This is a business strategy for Valve and theres nothing wrong with that but too many people act like they are some kind of gaming messiah.,linux,d0rj9nt,1,t5_2qh1a

6919201,0,t1_d10le9i,Or just anyone who doesnt use Arch or Fedora but is remotely technically competent.This utterly fictive hierarchy of systems that someone once invented with a beard image macro of Ubuntu lt Fedora lt Debian lt Arch lt Gentoo is stupid and just deals with difficulty of installation which is retarded.Arch installation is manual for no good reason. Yes you put your system together yourself because they based it on Crux but in Crux it happens for a reason because you make a lot of choices doing so. In Arch you dont its manual for no good reason and you dont make choices everyone ends up with the same system after the installation is completed and you reboot so they might as well just run a script that does that and they could they just dont. In sourcebased systems like Crux and Gentoo the reason its manual is because you make a bunch of choices during the installation and the installer cant guess your wishes.In Debian you also have some degree of choice honestly about as much as a binary system allows feasibly. But the default installation just made those choices for you but you can change them after you installed the system which you cant in Arch. Furthermore Debian has the option of a manual installation where you make those choices directly if you so desire. The netinstall is hidden somewhere deep inside the website but its there all the same.But that Arch is an extremely rigid system that offers its users virtually no choice is only half of the problem its just an extremely broken amateurish design that makes a bunch of assumptions on the state of your system that the package manager does not check and nor are those assumptions really listed at any point. Theres a reason Gentoo and Debian continue to be a darling of quite serious projects like corporations and servers and infrastructures while Arch remains isolated to the home desktop market of people who dont really want to power a company with it its because Gentoo and Debian take themselves and the use cases of their users seriously and attempt to find robust solutions to problems which never break and account for everything where Arch is satisfied with Meh itll probably work for  of users thats good enough for me.,linux,d10m56n,2,t5_2qh1a

Im kind of just snarkily highlighting what I believe to be the reason linux will not be a mainstream desktop OS or more generally appeal to a less than the most technical of individuals for a long time...  The developers who work on linux know linux so well that they live on the command line and often look down upon users who dont know the command line.  Thus they have little interest in helping to make Linux into an OS that could be in the mainstream on the desktopwhy would they?  They certainly dont need an OS that you can use without a commandline.  Not having a GUI tool to configure ltinsert common configuration task heregt doesnt bother them in the leastin fact they usually prefer it that way.  But the average person looks at this and runs away screamingright to windows or OSX.Dont get me wrong linux can be a nice desktop OS if youre familiar with it and I do believe that linux will one day be the biggest desktop OS... just not any time soon.

Good luck finding the code for that.Maybe I want my rendering theme to adjust to local daytime?

7039436,0,t1_d1e6w4b,I did test the memory consumption of GNOME  yesterday. When I first started it the RAM usage was about  MB for the entire system. With a few applications open it was up to about  MB but that was mostly due to the applications memory. This is actually not that bad because on MATE I get a RAM usage of about  MB on startup. If you keep in mind that gnomeshell has a plugin architecture that can alter almost everything it is fair enough.The gnomeshell process started out with  MB RAM and went up to  MB. This is no exact science however since the gnomeshell process mostly runs the Javascript interpreter which has a Garbage collection so RAM usage will go down whenever the Garbage collection runs. I used GNOME  myself for a few weeks and as far as I remember the gnomeshell process stays at about  MB.The RAM usage also depends on how much memory is installed in your machine. If you have more RAM the kernel will claim more memory to keep things in cache. So it could be that most of that memory was just used to cache things. I have  GB in my machine and my memory usage was lower which is an indicator for that.,linux,d1e9yvk,3,t5_2qh1a

Of course it isnt like using Arch as your first distro but it doesnt quite give you the out of the box experience that some other distros do give you.It depends on OP though. If OP has only ever used Windows for things like MS Word and a little bit of Web browsing it my get a bit tough for him. But if OP is already used to dealing with new technology I dont think it will be that hard. He may have to work on making Debian really his own but it not be a problem. If Linux distros had a difficulty score then Debian would have half a star or maybe a full star more than Ubuntu and Mint.

His response was that we should find him around lunch time so we did and he went with us to a chinese resturant that was near the conference. We where all pretty star struck and no one wanted to talk about linux or coding since we figured that was all people ever talked to him about so we mostly talked about what close by places we like to go hiking and stuff like that we all lived in or near portland at the time.

7258537,0,t1_d235xgz,Im replying to my own post here because I feel I should clarify the shell syntax for those who dont get what is going on since its filled with misconceptions.The braces you see around the command start what is called a subshell. This if you use bash. Doing  command ...  is essentially the same thing as doing bash c command ... it just starts a shell inside a shell. It starts a new process.Now the ampersand after it is typically misunderstood people say an ampersand means a fork. Yes and no. The ampersand does mean a fork but nothing is special about that. There is also a fork without the ampersand. The ampersand does a forkexec without it a forkexecwait is used the ampersand does not do more it does less.To understand this you have to understand how Unix process creation works. There is really only one way to create a process portably in Unix to do a fork. What does that mean? It means you split the current process in two and you create a copy of the current process. Dont worry this is cheap you arent actually copying. Underneath the hood this happens every time you start a new process it starts as a copy of another process that then gets changed.Next comes exec when a process execs it completely replaces itself with a new process the new process reuses the process id and process table of the old one which gets erased essentially. This is how you create a new process in general on Unix with forkexec the parent copies itself and the child then replaces itself with the new process. This is traditionally how its done but nothing stops you from letting the parent replace itself with the new process and letting the child continue on for a change but I would not recommend this.Finally wait comes into play. A parent process on Unix can wait on any child this basically blocks the current thread of executin until the child has ended running. This is what the shell does when you normally executes a command it waits. So yes it does an extra action when you dont use an ampersand the default action is to not wait.So how does this relate to the Daemon forking itself twice? Well it doesnt need to exec in that case why should it? The code contained for the eventual program is already in the original binary it doesnt need to replace itself with another one. So this is what happens if a daemon daemonizes itself. It forks itself once creates a copy of itself the original exits afterwards. The copy creates a copy of itself and then exits again. The second copy continues on running.This can be done because despite being copies both copies can know whether they are the original or the copy. Theyre not complete copies in that sense but it comes close enough.So what happens with startstopdaemon which daemonizes another process?. startstop daemon forks itself into a copy of itself and the original does not yet exit. the copy again forks itself into a copy and the first copy exits. the second copy execs itself into the eventual program it wants to daemonize remember to exec is to change yourself into another program.. the original startstopdaemon is still running now and monitors if the process was successful and happened as intended and then it exits.This is again different from what my shell code does. The shell first forks into a copy the original does not exit but keeps running. the copy execs itself into another shell yes you can exec into the same binary with different arguments the execd new shell then forks into a copy and exits.. The second copy execs into the eventual sleep processSo you clearly see that that there are some differences especially with how many execs happen. But the truth of the matter is that it doesnt matter for daemonization or not whether the execs happen or not. Hell to start startstopdaemon whatever process starts it lie the shell also performs a forkexec and probably a forkexecwait since again startstopdaemon exits indicating if it was successfull and to wait on a subprocess is the typical way to get its exit status.,linux,d238svx,5,t5_2qh1a

They have also stepped up their fuzzing efforts to find and squash bugs.They have also worked to minimize the kernel attack surface and have added additional hardening there. They update Kernel Patch Protection regularly and will be introducing a hypervisor based version of KPP soon from what I understand which will monitor the kernel for malicious modification from underneath meaning that it will be much harder to evade. Lastly if youre concerned about bootkits and malicious drivers SecureBoot and a chain of trust is a good thing as long as the user can choose to turn it off or add their own trusted certs.Of course none of this will prevent all malware and all exploits but thats an impossible task anyway.

7443785,0,t1_d2o8jk1,Reaper and Reason are different animals.  Reaper is more like a really good recorder editor and platform for supporting virtual effects and instruments that you can customize to your own workflow.  Reaper tries to be powerful and flexible in what it does only providing some generic but flexible effects of its own as well as an audio dsp scripting environment for the geekier users.  But it doesnt try to include third party type effects instruments and sample libraries.  The Reaper installer for windows is  MB in size if that tells you anything.  A rendered mp for an average song can be twice that size.Reason by contrast once tried to be a walled garden for MIDI users no audio recordingediting back then.  It included all effects instruments and audio samples and that business model worked well back when you had to spend  on the low side for nice daw software plus the cost of third party virtual instrumentseffects where Reason provided just enough of everything at a flat price to satisfy many users.  Also Reason was heavily pirated back then which probably helped alot in spreading its name and usage.  My first run in with Reason was via a pirated version and I later paid for licenses because I liked it and wanted to help support its development.  I have talked to many other Reason users who have the same story.  But as daws and third party virtual effectsinstruments grew more powerful Reasons walled garden approach couldnt continue satisfying users.   Eventually Propellerhead decided to turn Reason into a proper daw with audio recordingediting and to include some nicer effects and instruments which is when they moved to the awful dongle protection.  But at that point Reason was still far behind in what a user could do with a low cost daw thanks Reaper and some third party vst plugins many of which were gratis by this point thanks gratis and donation supported developers.  Propellerhead heavily ramped up the marketing hype effectively replacing the old marketing piracy.  But many users still werent satisfied with the walled garden wanting support for vst plugins which provide more power and variety.  Instead of giving users what they wanted Propellerhead went with the Apple model of an app store.  Now Reason users can run the app counterparts to desktop software read  limited functionality for exhorbitant prices.  Whats worse is that the licenses for these Rack Extensions plugins are tied to the Reason license where with other daws users can take their plugins with them when they change daws or even selltrade them if they wish since vst plugins are a standard which Propellerhead chose to ignore for their own profit.If I were in your shoes and I have been I would kick Reason to the curb.  Reaper  third party plugins is so much more powerful and with a much faster workflow once you get everything setup in a way that works best for you.  For example Reason doesnt even have user assignable shortcut keys where Reaper has powerful macros assignable keys mouse actions and MIDI actions.  I would suggest sticking to plugins that will run in linux many more do than you might think.  By the time that the kinks are worked out of Reaper running on linux natively it already runs in wine youll be able to easily migrate to running a linux daw.  Reaper is proprietary but it is far and away from your limiting your freedom as a user or milking you for cash.With Microsoft turning off so many workstation type users with their new business direction  Windows   linux could see many windows users and developers migrating in the coming years.  Reaper coming to linux is only one positive sign of that.,linux,d2ob7ez,4,t5_2qh1a

Linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system developed by the GNU Project.There really is a Linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added or GNULinux.

7632619,0,t1_d39rs9f,Based on what Ive read in Android the application fires a request to access systembinsu and Superuser or SuperSu catches that because it replaces the su binary. However thats not how it works in Linux. For example if you typed rm r tmp youll get an error saying Operation not permitted.  I could write an application like SuperSU. Its not hard to write a program that does what SuperSU does at all although the GUI would take a bit more time. But thats not the problem here.  The main problem here is that applications dont know if they need root permissions and wont ask and thus it cant be caught like it is in Android. But you as the user should know whether an application needs permissions. The Linux ecosystem was not designed like the Android ecosystem. In the Android ecosystem an application knows when it needs root access. Going against the flow here is not a good idea or practical as there are many many many applications. In general a Linux application generally setup programs do this is going to tell you to rerun the program with root permissions if it detects a failure due to that.,linux,d39scqk,3,t5_2qh1a

It wasnt Slackware.Slackware and Void are super smooth systems that require virtually no maintainance whatsoever because they dont push out changes unless the user wills it they update the same packages thats it they dont suddenly start making changes t your system that can break stuff.Finally the design philosophy of Void  and Slack is to use software that by design doesnt break because of how its built. Every new systemd update has some regressions. Voids init system Runit is dare I say completely bug free or at the very least no one ever reports a bug because its design is simple and rock solid.

By default the certificates are self signed and the responsibility of getting Alice to know Bob is delegated to the mean you use to share your RingID but as the ring ID is derived from the certificate then pinned locally there is no further MitM attack vector. When using PKI then get the certificates signed by trusted authorities and it should be handled.

Much of the development done in the community is aimed specifically at the beginners and allowing them to gracefully grow into becoming Linux wizards.The developer and user support communities are very helpful and are highly engaged with users through IRC a web forum and mailing listsIf you lean on the Fedora side of things Id recommend checking out Korora They refine Fedora into a firstclass experience for people who are starting out with Linux. They also offer friendly user support If openSUSE interests you then Id recommend checking out GeckoLinux a derivative of openSUSE focused on polish and usability. IMO openSUSE is a bit chunky on the UX and GeckoLinux attempts to refine things to make things better.All three distributions I listed above are totally great with Steam. All three also provide excellent C and web development environments.

Bigger libraries came with their own shellscript usually something like fooconfig that was created at compile time with the current compile configuration of the library. That shell script took about the same arguments as pkgconfig and returned the same. So instead of using pkgconfig ltlibrarygt you had glibconfig gtkconfig qtconfig and several other calls in your makefile. The solution of every library writing a textfile with its config and those text files being processed by pkgconfig is a huge step forward.,linux,d4bcqyq,2,t5_2qh1a

People cant expect developers to package for every system.  People never did they expect devs to make available code making a package yourself is easy.. Do you want Linux to remain elitist or something? Normal users are scared of the command line.  Okay so make a GUI frontend that does the same thing problem solved.. Its not as simple as you make it out to be the library hell is a mess.  Its exactly as simple as I make it out to be with a package manager like Nix it just requires source code to be there.. But be pragmatic source code isnt always there fight the battles you can win.  Well I dont entirely disagree with you here.Im not going to say the goalpost has been moved because I had four replies against three different people but these are all completely different things people raise and were getting way of track.

If you like this mission you can contribute code to GNU. Canonical is under no such obligation. Even if you agree with what they are doing right now there is nothing stopping them from completely changing their strategy in the future.gtCanonicals CLA for instance contains the provision that Canonical will continue to license your code under the same Licence it was originally licensed at when the agreement was made.Does it also promise that the rest of the program will always be under any specific license? Or that your code will never be made available under any different license?Because if not this clause is basically pointless because Canonical could easily switch the program to a new license or a proprietary license continue offering an older version and just say The code that hasnt changed from older versions is also available under older licenses but the program as a whole includes code solely available under a new license and the program as a whole is therefore under the new license as well.gtIf you for instance disagreed with the Tivoization clause and originally contributed under GPLv to the FSF tough luck they own the copyright they now licensed it under GPLv and you have no legal recourse.You can download an older version of the program which is still under GPLv extract any code from it and use it under GPLv. Moreover AFAIK their copyright assignments include a clause that in exchange for the copyright the FSF gives you a license to do whatever you want with the code you contributed.gtYes backdoors can also exist in hardware which is why the only way to get actual RYF is with free hardware images.I agree but FSF currently doesnt insist on free hardware as they do on free software. But I cant fault them for that they are the Free Software Foundation after all and free hardware is a separate although related issue.gtWhat is considered free software is not decided by a court of law its designed by the FSFThat is a complex issue and Im not a lawyer. But they publish a free software definition and this is what you agree to at the time of writing. The free software definition doesnt include a clause that says This definition can be changed entirely at the sole discretion of the Free Software Foundation or anything to that effect so yes if you sign a contract referring to this definition the court will have to take it into consideration as part of the contract.,linux,d4d6k95,6,t5_2qh1a

Linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day without realizing it.

It obviously varies on a per case basis due to an enormous amount of variables involved in modern computing but at least in my experience the more popular Linux distributions are far more usable than Windows for many use cases.

Every distro has their own set of packages those packages are created with absolutely no control by the person who wrote the code some of it modified for integration or a personal whim of the distro for that distro.  Those differences create bugs every distro has their own bug database in which the main vendor cant replicate because its not part of mainline.  The whole thing has turned complex for those who have large or complex code bases.  Even better the user blames the vendor not the distro.So no it isnt a sane situation at all and it is certainly not something that can be sustained in the long run.  Developers should have control over their code and how it is distributed not distributions.I have no intention of paying you to use GNOME software.

Which is why you should buy a Chromebook for a cheap Linux laptop because the chances of you running Linux on a Chromebook are generally higher considering Chromebooks run a specialized version of the Linux kernel and generally the BIOS just checks to see if the drive is partitioned a specific way so you dont necessarily need firmware to run Linux.gtUEFI firmware runs with higher privilege than an OS kernel and as OEMs are literally under control of Microsoft for them to be able to build PCs and laptops with the Windows compatible label MS could just mandate another EFI applicationfirmware change to be shipped including literal Microsoftcontrolled backdoors which is what they already do at a lesser extent with Secure Boot.  EDIT Hardware Compatibility List. Generally Haswell and Broadwell models are best supported. It seems the HP Chromebook G runs Linux without any firmware upgrades which uses Skylake.

So youre literally silod into use something like SLES or SLES for years together.The thing with yours means that you can only use source to compile all your apps in order to not track multiple of the same library.  But if an app is only QAd with the versions of the library the developer used then you might run into stability issues.  There isnt that many runtimes to choose from for now and OSTree suports deduplication so there is only one version.Secondly you are hopefully the final say on what actually gets installed on the system.  Trying to install a system level app is not going to fly with you I would assume.  But you cant stop a user from installing from source an application which is where runtimes using user comes in.So basically everything is a trade off but the technology is not inherently bad it is a question of policy.,linux,d507387,1,t5_2qh1a

If you dont have those stats you by definition cant tell me that it is rare can you? gtHowever there is no need due to the fact that Reddit implements its own approach to condensing lengthy URLs  see belowThis is not the only or even the main issue.gtYes to both.Ok challenge time! Post me a copy of the official Part  rules from the FCC the PDF doc from mobile device only. Not a search for it but a link to the actual document. No cheating and using a non mobile device. Bonus points if you time yourself. Having done so in the past only to have my link removed due to google auto redirect I can tell you I did not bother resubmitting the two comments that were removed linking to the official docs. gtAutoMod doesnt autoremove long links Again not sure why you are focusing on long links as those are not the issue since as you said they are not what is removed. I am focusing on links directly from a google search which are technically redirects not shorteners since the google redirects often make the original url longer... although semantics really. gteven incredibly long links into something more manageableAgain this is not the same thing. You are linking to a page that is a search. What if you tried to direct link me to one of the images from that page? Feel free to try. Its a really common way of using the internet. rightlong click copy link. Unless you expand the image go to the original source and copy that link the auto mod bot will come along and delete that shit. gtAgreed but again  this happens so rarely that its not much of an issue in the first place.Again with out those stats your claims are not supported. It clearly is an issue if not only I but others in this thread are affected by it. Also if its such a minimal issue implementing a warning should be sufficient deterrent since it is such a rare occurrence as is. The benefit would be not having the comment deleted needlessly. gtOf course but thats not something we can control anyway and thus isnt the issue we are trying to tackle at all.So what issue are you trying to tackle by preventing me linking to google search results exactly?

8182288,0,t1_d50ad0m,. Malware isnt a reason to ignore a packaging system linux boxes get malware too and tend to have huge security holes just like windows and OSX.. So the command line is easier I can install a brand new build of fedora open the terminal and type dnf install chrome vlcplayer and then watch as it tells me those arent available. so then. I go and download a deb or rpm on windows i just go download the installer for windows for osx its the same thing. So now the person using their machine has to know what  deb or and rpm is well lets say I want to install spotify since that wasnt in my repo either well I am on fedora and it comes as a deb well now I have to know what alien is while the person on their mac next to me just went to spotify and downloaded the installer.. I wouldnt see a point in having a snap package for libre office because it usually ships with the os. but  a snap package for photoshop or autocad would be useful.. Windows and linux already share a plethora of features even though they are quite different. Linux is about giving people choice maybe some people would like to have package installation be a universal affair no matter what os they are on.  There are s of different cars on the road but you can get into any of them and the basic functionality is the same yet the looks feel etc are all different.. So ok i am exaggerating a bit but because I have a choice to use fedora and someone decides they only want to build their app for ubuntu so now it is on me to get what they made to work with what I have or to use ubuntu. a good  of people trying out linux are going to take the ubuntu option or just go back to windowsosx so no their choice is limited because they either have to fight with their OS or use one they may not agree with or support.. I do still agree that using the command line is way faster and easier once it is setup with the required repos because I can install my system from scratch using a bash script. It just isnt friendly for the general population. I cant see cmd line packaging every going away because setting up a base system using a gui package manager would be infuriating like on windows or osx but in the case of windows they are building a command line experience comparable to the linux package managers inside of powershell. Also while we are talking about canonical I do think the way they are going about this is quite shady but i look at this more of a hate the company not the philosophy situation. I like the idea of being able to switch my family away from windows or OSX devices since they tend to be very draconian but there is no way my mom is going to drop down to a command line to install chrome.,linux,d50c3v6,4,t5_2qh1a

They used ZeroMQ and really could link into what ever service they wanted to. They just linked to their own server and filtered traffic though that. Botched sure they should have made it an option and it was definitely not even a great service at the time because there was a lag in results for everything in the dash while it waited for results from their server. gt Yes thats what The Great Shuttleworth tried to convince the world in the same post as his erm we have root remark which  mind you  was the tipping point for me realizing that Canonical does not have the communitys interests in mind in any way whatsoever. Never mind that  again  way more people use a search engine than a shopping site and this wasnt any different  years ago. Also never mind that its specifically bundled into the unitylensshopping package and always has been last I checked Launchpad seems to agree with me though.Well I think the comment was made to say look we are the ones developing the distro so they can do what they want with it. That is both a positive and a negative one because they can shoot themselves in the foot too. gt Instead Canonical  in their infinite wisdom  decided that such a solution wasnt horrible enough and thus decided to make it difficult to search for local files and Amazon products. Nice going.Well there was a reason for it not having a good Amazon search which I mentioned. The only reason why the Amazon site has a good search system is because they have context results. They limit certain areas and they show some areas only because of previous searches. If you remove the context it removes the good search options. It was a pain in the ass either way and that is why they should have just put an Amazon search lens and have it use context correctly. Im not saying it wasnt a bad thing. gt And because the lens returned NSFW results for benign queries and because the lens returned results for software not compatible with Ubuntu and because of various other issues that are entirely independent of the notion that Canonical was supposedly not tracking its users.See above about the NSFW. The tracking thing I dont know about I didnt see Canonicals code so I cant know.gt And honestly trying to play the well Red Hat does some of this stuff too card doesnt help your case. Why is Canonical so averse to setting a positive example for the rest of the GNULinux ecosystem and community? Why cant it take Nelson Mandelas advice?

8246939,0,t1_d57oupw,That would make sense if GNOME was actually minimal and just limited itself to that and allowed itself to be supplemented which it doesnt on many levels it horribly horribly gets in your way GNOME has a hard dependency of DBusactivation disable DBusactivation and itll crash. DBusactivation takes control of your system an starts enabling and disabling services you might not want enabled GNOME shell in its binary has a notification daemon built in and thus assumes the org.freedesktop.Notification name on the session bus which only one process can take. There is no way to disable this and get your own GNOME shell has compositing built into its binary again making it impossible to just use another composite manager GNOME shell nonoptionally grabs many keys which makes it fight if you want to run your own hotkey management daemon because GNOMEs implementation is very poor GNOME shell starts a tonne of daemons in the background a lot as root with setuid helpers. systemds controversial new default of KillUserProcessyes most likely purely exists because some of those daemons dont actually die like they should when you log out. GNOME has a hard dependency on a particular login manager which has a hard dependency on a particular pid which has a hard dependency on a particular libc and kernel. Thats how much GNOME takes control over your system it decides for you what your pid libc and kernel must be. GNOME has a tonne of nondisablable UI elements which thus cant be either disabled or replace with other things GNOME officially actually does not even support themes.I dont get people who say I use GNOME because it gets out of my way are you kidding me. GNOME is constantly  in your way it takes control of your system both on a UI and lower system component level forces a particular visual style and workflow onto you as well as forcing notifications and whatnot in your face and is just an all around nuisance.The interface I use is far more minimal than GNOME shell I dont have a status bar I dont have a settings panel I dont have a tonne of things GNOME has but I could get them if I wanted to. THe problem with GNOME is not thatit doesnt provide certain features the problem is that it actually stops you from getting elsewhere what it doesnt provide because it takes control of your system and starts fighting and clashing with anything you might install alongside it.GNOME tends to talk a lot about wasting space I have no borders around my windows none windows indicate focus by becoming less transparent. GNOME gets in my way because with GNOME you cant just remove that without using theming hacks that are unofficial and will break the next update because client side decorations that dont allow themselves to be disabled their borders simply get it my way and I cant remove them.,linux,d58f8is,0,t5_2qh1a

Part of that concept included things like you tend to lose cognitive ease when reading text that is blurry and not crisply defined and how little interruptions when performing slow thinking activities will tend to reduce cognitive ease.With this information and having been using Mac at work for nearly two years I realized the latest Linux desktop environment alone wasnt enough I needed a high quality display and input device set and mobility ergo high battery life to be satisfied with an effective computing platform.  So last year I switched to a MacBook Pro retina.At this point if I can get  hours of my regular use on a high quality piece of hardware without having to manually build and configure any kernel modules to support it then desktop Linux will become something I once again consider but at this point my motives for using desktop Linux are completely different than when I first decided.,linux,d5frwf4,1,t5_2qh1a

The only way to ensure you are not using a tainted ISO is to verify the file. Thats regardless of what protocol you use to download the file and regardless of wherewhom you got the file from from a mirror an ftp site a torrent a MITM or anywhere else. The checksum needs to be on a site with a valid  cert so you know its coming from the right people that is true but I believe that is case with all of the distros he mentions. So his claim that some distros like openSUSE are providing ISOs that cant be trusted based on them not being served over  is simply wrong and shows a basic misunderstanding of the technology. For someone claiming to enlighten us regarding these concerns thats a big mistake to make. Hes right to get criticism for it.

The important policies of the project are still strong neutrality CC licensed no advertisement....My problem with WP is that their editorial guidelines are not guidelines but basically an advertisement text they ignore when it suits them to seem more enlightened like any constitution basically.In principle Wikipedias editorial guidelines say no original research as in they bring the scientific consensus even if it is wrong even if you can prove it is wrong. And I respect that truth is hard to define so they dont bring the truth but the mainstream scientific consensus even if its wrong. But when you remove original research which is clearly true but not sourced or add citation you are suddenly a troll.gt Well it seems to stylish to have beef with systemd ...but whats your problem with the BSDs?Same thing the base system is basically less modular than systemd. systemd not being modular is one of its biggest criticisms its not composed of interchangeable parts which may be swapped out for others as one so desires.

Once you say let me just use my laptop with Windows and Hyperterm you are emulating and when you integrate it all into the OS skip the serial port and have the OS drive a monitor via VGA graphics and connect to a virtual port... devtty etc. you are virtual.,linux,d5ve8zh,5,t5_2qh1a

If someones rebooting a Windows server to fix issues then they are either working with terrible software or dont know what theyre doing.In practice our servers have an uptime of between  and  days maximum because we have a timetabled update schedule and most update batches include at least one that requires a reboot. I dont see the problem with downtime personally if you want long service uptime you need redundancy anyway individual node uptime is pretty much a non issue. An IT department should also have regular maintenance windows as a standard thing.I wouldnt advise it but Ive seen Windows servers running actual services with uptimes in excess of two years.

8630687,0,t1_d6kfbyw,gt I was confused about what scenario you were talking about and thought you meant they could use logind to gain control of system resources already in use Yeah if attacker can modify users path can trick them into running malicious program. Im also not sure why the logind requirement even exists it just seems a bit goofy.There are some real benefits to what logind offers and it allows a compositor to run as a normal user without any setuid or setgid magic and get raw input without the user itself being in the input group.This also has disadvantages from just putting the compositor into setgid input and letting it open the file descriptors itself.But the main thing that logind can do here is that it can freeze the file descriptors it hands the compositor when the user loses the seat. It also means again that a user can actually compile a compositor without having root and use it from being installed in a local directory since you need to in the input group or root to make a setgid input executable.The hard requirement in libinput only offering this and being unwilling to open file descriptors itself if its setgid input or running as root or if the user running it is in the input group just reeks of the usual RH dependency politics though.gt If you end up changing UIDs and adding a new etcpasswd youve done something wrong and are adding unnecessary complexity now you will be forced to write more complex ipc to deal with it instead of just using filesystem normally.

8632650,0,t1_d6kc2kt,Its not so much that theres a fake key with his name you can do that easily. I can create a dozen from my phone its that the short hex representation of the fingerprint of the key matches. So if you have seen that Linus has a fingerprint of x there are now two that have that fingerprint. Assuming a totally linear distribution theres a inbillion chance of this happening randomly its not linear and there are various attacks you can use to help force a matchFortunately the long form fingerprints are different  you just have to read a longer number to verify. That said most people probably read the first  bytes and the last  bytes and call it a match. The real fun thing is the tools that build a self web of trust. I see one key that has  signatures I assume its fake. I see one key that has half a dozen signatures it may be fake. But there are scripts now where you give it a list of names and email addresses scrape from the LKML archives and it generates a very plausible web of trust. Linus has signed Alan Cox Alan has sign Linus both have signed Rusty etc. all using fake keys with non matching fingerprints. If you were to combine the shortform match technique with this youd have a moderately convincing key set.The defence against this is to get the persons fingerprint from a trusted source eg their website served over  Fun thing I attempted to verify I think it was SuSE distro signing key and could not find a trust  website that had their key at the time. In the end I found their key was signed by a SuSE dev and I found his key fingerprint on his website which was served over ,linux,d6kos9n,9,t5_2qh1a

8651176,0,t1_d6mt75j,Honestly crazy as it sounds I think this is a longform embrace extend extinguish on Linux on the server thats banking on brand familiarity to new learners.I know many people who while learning would do things such as write C code in Visual Studio then port the code over to Linux to make sure it compiled instead of learning the Linux environment. This to me looks like a grab at that market  people who want to do things on the server dont want to go through the learning curve of Linux but have to work on Linux anyway. I think the point is to get a foot in the door and build inertia in the Windows way of working on new Linux server admins then as people get used to it more and more have them run into instances where something is still doable in powershell on Linux but would just be easier in powershell on Windows. The hope of this would be to slowly bleed the Linux market on servers dry as people who grew up with Windows on the desktop were able to use windows tools on the server then later as they got higher in their company would be able to switch servers to Windows.Considering MSs history it seems somewhat reasonable. What makes me more uncomfortable is the fact that this is leveraging the fact that people are familiar with Windows and would take a more circuitous route to do something if they feel theres less of a learning curve because most people dont grow up with Linux thats not something I see Linux being able to fight back against.While I feel like Ive got a bit of a tinfoild hat on given Microsofts long storied history of EEEs Ive got a decent reason to distrust them.,linux,d6n0dmi,13,t5_2qh1a

8659405,0,t3_4yfm8n,I know this is going to be unpopular but could someone explain to me the apparent double think around DRM and Encryption.It seems like everyone here gets their pants in a twist when someone suggests that people should be able to bypass your encryption.My understanding is encryption exists because you dont wish for third parties who you havent authorized to be able to access your communicationsor data. But on the other end the moment someone suggests that Firefox be able to support Netflix DRM everyone loses their shit. It seems to me that DRM is supposed to prevent third parties from accessing media and communication between you and a company which you have a contract with to watch their media. I do think this gets a bit sticky around the subject of physical media but in the streaming arena I think it is obvious thatyou dont own the content you rent it from moment to momentI understand that sometimes DRM is a pain in the ass and when it isnt it is better.

Next instead of needing to remember a packages name to download it you must know its exact URL which is less than likely so you..  Google it try not to pick a malware or scam site or a site that will wrap the real software in adware.  find the download link and click it Navigate to the folder and click on the exe  click next  times  uncheck the boxes that say you want another browser tool bar and to change your default search engine and home page repeat this exact procedure for each software package  either repeat this process per package for updates or deal with every app having its own updater process that runs in the background and periodically interrupts youThese exes wont figure out deps for you so you must do that this is obnoxious so many will just package everything required in one big lump ensuring that you end up with  of some libraries any bugs fixed in one wont be fixed in the other until each developer updates it. Believing that you need to be able to just download exes already is a symptom of not taking advantage of the platform. Its like lamenting that your Chevy doesnt come with a godamn buggy whip.

Look how many features are being introduced in the kernel now. It seems like every  new version theres at least  Grsecurity features being brought in.So it may be that the Grsec guys asked for too much at once but its also true that the Linux developers didnt care about Grsec security features until recently either. And you get that feeling from basically any interview with Linus too. Its almost like these features had to be forced upon the Linux kernel developers with the arrival of IoT and autonomous vehicles as well as with a general increase in awareness about security issues from outside of the Linux community.

8931693,0,t1_d7kyj6m,Having worked for a university that used to charge for Dorm room internet they have since changed the practice and included the costs as part of their dorm fees The reason why they dont allow students to use NAT is that students will quite regularily plug their little Dlink router in the wrong way and basically setup a bad DHCP server. NAT itself can cause problems aswell. The last few years there have been more and more cheap home routers that use  Class A addresses with an  bit subnet mask  by default. If any of the Universitys servers are using Private addressingClass A someone using the same address space wouldnt be able to access those hosts. Ive been running into this with some some work from home employees that have Comcast as their ISP when they try to access things through VPN we can force all traffic through the VPN tunnel for them Another issue is if the University is using  Class C Private IPs for older parts of their network that started in isolation and havent been brought up to the rest of the standard. I understand the OPs frustration but I understand the reason behind the policy. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to manage a network that has subnets that you cant manage besides disconnecting that subnet from the network when it causes problems. Which as far as I know cant really be automated.  In the end the OP can NAT his dorm room if he wants and if he wanted to he could setup a VPN tunnel outside of the University in order to ensure that he has access to everything he would if he was living at home. Also ensuring that all of his network traffic was obfuscated from the university. Which has benefits of its own. READ keep him out of trouble with the school for his internet usage However I also imagine that getting caught especially with something more robust could get him in a fair bit of trouble.  They would probably push for harsher punishment given the fact that he understood what he was doing. ,linux,d7lghjm,2,t5_2qh1a

So we are assuming the current flat design of the day courtesy of Microsoft is modern and in your eyes at least better for an Open Source developers workflow?Curiously the Metro flat slab design echos back to I think it was AOLs presentation in the s.Also from other comments how LibreOffice looks depends on the compilation options given while compiling it.

The standard on other Unix systems was Motif but due to that being commercial it wasnt really usable for Linux OSS development.Then Qt came out and it was pretty impressive. A good number of widgets styled pretty well and with a good enough license. Still there were some missing widgets that were becoming increasingly standard in the wake of Win boosting GUI development so we formed a little project to create some addons for Qt just like KDE libraries do these days.Then ambition and youthful exuberance happened and Qt didnt look that great anymore. License issues poor use of C features no new ground in UI building and other stuff that mattered to idealistic s Linuxheads.So we expanded and wanted to create our own endallbeall GUI solution. And a short time after that we were just another abandoned OSS project.While we were still programming away or at least slinging around comparisons of Talient NeXt SmallTalk and other UI modelsa the Kool Desktop Environment was founded. I still remember chiding them on their lack of design documents and styleguides on some mailing list still true.But releasing something bad is better than releasing nothing...And then some other people reinvented X toolkit intrinsics badly and here we are but I hear that next year surely will be the year of Linux on the desktop...,linux,d8rljm6,21,t5_2qh1a

9405650,1,t1_d97gynf,Im not sure you really understand how things work here let me try to put it in a simple way.At boot time bootloader can configure the kernel by passing arguments through the so called kernel command line. Then this command line has been exposed to userspace through the proccmdline so that userspace programs could know how the kernel has been booted.But then some userspace programs especially init ones though it could be a good idea to also use the kernel command line to be configured. It was very convenient for init programs because they could be configured without the need of a mounted filesystem.So systemd developpers decided to use the debug argument of the kernel command line to switch to debug modes. This kernel command line argument was already used and usefull by the kernel for years before that. The problem here is that setting systemd in debug mode will be so verbose that the system wont be able to boot. So that is not a kernel bug.Let say you want to debug your kernel and you set debug in the kernel command line you wont be able to boot just because systemd decided to go in debug mode also.Hiding some kernel parameter from proccmdline is not a solution because it goes against what proccmdline is.The solution here would have been simple. If a userspace program find that being configured from the kernel command line it is fine while they use a specific namespace prefix for their arguments. Systemd could have solved its bug by looking for systemd.debug instead of debug in the command line so you could independantly set the kernel or systemd in debug mode. But Key Sievers systemd dev refused this solution.So for me its clearly a systemd bug because          Putting systemd in debug mode will be so verbose the machine cannot boot         Systemd uses a well known already used for another purpose kernel command line argument to choose to go in debug modeBut I may be wrong here and you are free to think otherwise but at least please bring technical arguments.,linux,d988dev,-1,t5_2qh1a

Ive bought two in the fast four years. However one of the reasons why Thinkpads are highly regarded is because only a few manufacturers try to compete Elitebook Travelmate and certain models from Dell and there isnt a terribly large amount of competition for the Thinkpad line.This is because most laptops are sold in the  range and the average laptop selling price is apparently .

And just a quick search on the internet for articles referring to bitch turned up  of them and all of them referred to a female dog. Then again they were mainstream publications not prone to slang.

I switched to Xubuntu and apart from WiFi drivers not working after a suspend I had almost no troubles. This last month I got bored with Xubuntu. I justified that I like AUR better than PPAs and switched back to Manjaro. So far it looks very stable. Even the WiFi works after system suspend.My only complaint so far is about fonts. No matter how much tinkering I did I cant make them have the Xubuntu quality. They look much better than the factory defaults  but still I see some rough edges in websites here and there.The upside is that I learned about fontconfig and its configuration.P.S.

That kind of stuff is perfect for mounting attacks.And meanwhile the kind of defense you get from antivirus is fairly weak compared to other hardening techniques  malware scanning is usually done through two approaches blacklistbased using a virus signature database and heuristicbased monitoring the behavior of processes and flagging suspicious activity. Blacklists are intrinsically problematic anything we dont know about gets through and naturally reactive can only blacklist things we already know heuristics are really really hard to get right and even then theres going to be a rather unpleasant amount of false positives and negatives that process trying to delete all of your files may very well be a legitimate command you issued.,linux,d9zqal0,22,t5_2qh1a

This contrasts Pantheon Mate and Xfce where they are. You can just choose to not run Pantheons own notification daemon and install the one of Xfce and autostart that one.Of course obligatory mention of that DBus activation fucks you over potentially if you have multiple ones installed because in theory the activation can start the wrong one when a notification is sent before the autostart mechanism completes.

These rules could hook the input device up to something so that when keys are hit sounds play.Just like when a USB storage device is inserted default rules mount it in mediauserlabel if possible. This is how a lot of things are set up now. E.g. when I play a movie the sound goes to some default sound output device which is sensibly chosen. If I dont like it I can change it.

Elsewhere in the thread actually I think it was an offthread email that got included somehow they talk about how power management is  of the struggle.gtWe are dealing with ever more complex hardware with the push to reduce power while driving more pixels through.  It is the power reduction that is causing us driver developers most of the pain.  Display is a high bandwidth real time memory fetch sub system which is always on even when the system is idle.  When the system is idle pretty much all of power consumption comes from display.  Can we use existing DRM infrastructure?  Definitely yes if we talk about modes up to Mpixs and leaving a lot of voltage and clock margin on the table.  How hard is it to set up a timing while bypass most of the pixel processing pipeline to light up a display?  How about adding all the power optimization such as burst read to fill display cache and keep DRAM in selfrefresh as much as possible?  How about powering off some of the cache or pixel processing pipeline if we are not using them?  We need to manage and maximize valuable resources like cache cache  silicon area   and clock  power and optimize memory request patterns at different memory clock speeds while DPM is going in real time on the system.  This is why there is so much code to program registers track our states and manages resources and its getting more complex as HW would prefer SW program the same value into  different registers in different sub blocks to save a few cross tile wires on silicon and do complex calculations to find the magical optimal settings the hated bandwidthcals.c.  There are a lot of registers need to be programmed to correct values in the right situation if we enable all these powerperformance optimizations.,linux,db0kccs,15,t5_2qh1a

9979048,1,t1_db89xuz,I feel like the Ribbon is under appreciatedFor starters if youre going to use libre office with a touchscreen you may have a much better time with the ribbon then you will with a bunch of menus that you need to open every time you need some obscure button or to manage multiple toolbars. With newer versions of MS Office you can customize your ribbon to cut down to only the buttons you need.The Ribbon is basically a bunch of drop down menus combined with a bunch of toolbars and it makes use of horizontal space that a normal drop down menu normally wouldnt. Plus you can design a ribbon to expand or shrink to fit the screen. Or hide it entirely until you need it. It does use a bit more screen space to some extent but I think its a good adaptation for touchscreens and much easier to show somebody then the file menu equivalent.Windows s file explorer uses ribbon UI and I really dont think its that terrible considering they can combine ideas from settings dialogs menus and toolbars into one cohesive fit. For instance clicking one tab and being able to instantly understand that the user has show hidden files turned off because its a checkbox and you dont need to tell the user to click this thing then this thing then this thing. Instead you tell them to click a tab and look for a button on top of the screen.I wouldnt call the Ribbon easy to grasp immediately but in my opinion once you understand how to use it its more preferable to a drop down menu IMO.,linux,db8aqyc,8,t5_2qh1a

Im not a fan of the Ubuntu philosophy of well custom build and change things to work just with this distribution of which Unity is a part good luck getting it working on any other distro. I remember one preUnity release of Ubuntu where whenever a Python program threw an exception it would import like  packages just to pop up an alert through Ubuntus GNOME alert system or something. Every time an exception was thrown that wasnt caught by some other handler. Every Python program. What were they thinking?Ubuntu also inherits the philosophy from Debian of discouraging the user from managing hisher own conf files by routinely clobbering them with distrospecific tools necessitating the use of those tools in order to change things. Debian has a fucking DSL for setting up network interfaces and Ubuntu uses that. Fedora also has a DSL but its different. Editing resolv.conf doesnt work you have to use the resolvconf tool to point Ubuntu to where your DNS servers are.Its enough to make me yearn for the sanity of Slackwares etcrc.drc.inet.But wait I hear you say. You dont have to use the shell to do any of that you can use the Control Center to configure NetworkManager and... just shut up right there. Dont even get me started on NetworkMangler. I dont want it I dont want packages that depend on it I dont want it on my system. I want everything to be nice and straightforward the way Unix usually is.

You cant expand or shrink existing configurations of disks once you setup a RAIDZ you cant add disks to it. The only option to expand it is to swap all drives in the array one by one.The only option remaining is to add vdevs which reduces the redundancy options usually leading to RAID recommendations which have their own probabilistic problems.As previously mentioned I have a Synobox with HybridRAID. This configuration can easily expand memory space even before all disks have been swapped. On the disk redundancy adding  disks already expands the space automatically no matter of the remaining disks.ZFS doesnt do this easily.If I am going to build a new storage box one requirement is that it needs to be flexible. If I put in new drives they should add space without thinking about it and without sacrificing redundancy.ZFS does not feature that not even with dedup off.,linux,dbwm9ye,0,t5_2qh1a

10282887,0,t1_dc9k66p,gt Youre clearly missing my point  Im not talking about privsep for system services  Im talking about taking as much responsibility for system management as possible away from the single most critical process on the system  not from the systemd package but from PID.     I realized that and as explained several times that this is exactly what the the systemd developers have done.  Please name just one example of something being in PID that could be in another daemon. Until now you have just broadly claimed that PID do too much but have been unable to explain what exact features you mean.     My second point is that while PID stability and security is important it is important to put both in a broader context   The simplicity of SysVinit has high security costs maybe not in PID but certainly in the rest of the system because SysVinit doesnt take responsibility for security. Having the system exploited because SysVinit caused setuid problems in a service make the whole point of simplicity as security a void one.   systemd is actually capable of providing a much higher overall system security than SysVinitOpenRC etc ever will. Yes pid is slightly bigger than pid under SysVinit but the added security and features are totally worth it.    gt Im done talking to you.

10303957,0,t3_5njq5d,The problem with that approach is that you just shuffles the problems around and all in all end up with a more complex and bugprone system.    When PID doesnt understand cgroups then PID must do that and coordinate and communicate with PID so you introduce latency and race conditions etc.   Take fx. systemds ability to provide resource management per service instead of merely per process. That means that no matter how many workersubprocess the service spawns they will be confined with the same resource restrictions.    This is a highly desirable feature and is in principle doable for  OpenRC and other initsRC based on SysVinit. But the practical problems in doing so with a simple PID that doesnt understand cgroups seems so huge that people have just given up.   gtAnd would it really solve any problems or would it just satisfy the purist sense of aesthetics and tradition?    I wont solve real world problems since systemds PID is remarkably stable.    You can design a modern initsystems in many ways and systemds way is just one way of doing so. But being fixated on only having a primitive PID as a dumb way of designing such a system.     And seriously making a new initsystem that is based on setting up services with executable config files consisting of unconfined shell scripts running as root simply is a dumb idea.   ,linux,dcc0bub,23,t5_2qh1a

10510252,0,t1_dczdzh4,gt The British law fits my definition of stealing because you are either stealing their money if theyre trying to sell it or youre stealing their discretion of ownership if theyre not selling it. Copyright law is specifically designed to connect ethereal things like that to tangible things. This is from US law and Im quoting Wikipedia for conveniencegt In copyright law infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owners possession but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization. Courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft. gt Not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in  that infringement does not easily equate with theft.In fact some courts have even gone further and may hold you in contempt if you equate theft and copyright infringement in courtgt copyright holders industry representatives and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft  language which some U.S. courts now regard as pejorative or otherwise contentious.Heres a precedent for that. MPAA was banned from using words like theft in a copyright infringement trial.I dont know if UK law is different but I doubt it. I dont think youve got much of a leg to stand on when claiming that theyre the same thing.Saying piracy is theft because youre stealing their money is just shoehorning things. That would mean reselling your moviegamecd is also theft since you deprive the copyright holder of a purchase they could otherwise have made.gt Functionally they differ if a unique irreplaceable object is being stolenHow is it not different when stealing a nonunique object? If I break into a dealership and steal a car Im actually depriving them of the opportunity to sell this car which isnt the case with piracy and Im preventing them from being able to recuperate the substantial production costs of this specific car again something that doesnt happen with piracy.Regardless of moral or ethical judgements or the value of the object stolen piracy and theft are objectively not the same.,linux,dczg5wz,6,t5_2qh1a

10514904,0,t1_dczy5w0,I mean how do they? Copyright law confers an exclusive right to manufacture copies of a work but doesnt grant ownership of the work because the work isnt recognized as ownable. Ownership for instance isnt limited in duration like copyright is. And copyright doesnt bar others from modifying the work without permission which ownership certainly does.Trade secrets arent even recognized in federal US law and werent recognized at the state level until recently. Historical enforcement used standard contract law via NDAs. Trade secret laws just go a bit farther to standardize remedies.Its especially hard to see how youd consider doctorpatient confidentiality as ownership of information. Its really not all that different than the situation if you and I signed a NDA before a conversation. In that case a breach of confidentiality isnt a property violation but a contract violation  we had the discussion under the explicit understanding it wouldnt be shared. Doctorpatient and attorneyclient are just special widely standardized instances of this.The information in your head example is especially weird. How do you envision these supposed property rights even working? Do I automatically cede my ownership rights if I tell anyone about it? Do I automatically lose rights if I even use the information for anything? For instance the information in question is a code someone could legally record me entering it.,linux,dczz6fc,2,t5_2qh1a

All of the important parts of Googles Arc are open source and according to a Google dev theres nothing stopping people from implementing this approach elsewhere  That said there are many interacting components in Arc and Ive been told that without more guidance from Google its currently difficult to figure out how they all interact. The Arc project is still in beta and the Google folks are busy rolling out Arc to more Chromebooks so they havent taken the time to provide much guidance. But based on a talk given by David Reveman from Google at XDC Google seems receptive to discussion.My guess is that supporting Arc on a traditional GNULinux distribution would require among other things using a kernel that has been compiled to include some components such as Binder that although available in the mainline kernel arent typically compiled into kernels that are used with traditional GNULinux distributions.

10805349,0,t1_ddtbv5x,This is a bit late and Im definitely piggybacking off of this but I feel like its really worth mentioning how process scheduling works at the hardware level particularly with interrupts and counters because when I found out what was actually going on to make multiprocessing on a single processor work it changed my entire programming world view. Practically every microprocessor worth using has dedicated counter hardware. You write a value to a specific area of memory or a specific register you go about your business and when you read that memory later the counter hardware has incremented or decremented that value in parallel with the main instruction set. This is how you get highprecision tick counts in user code and when paired with interrupts you can use this counter to switch into a different process. Interrupts are specially defined hardware events that cause the CPU to execute defined regions of code regardless of the current state of the previously executing code region. If a handler is defined for a given interrupt when the relevant hardware event happens the current execution context is paused and the interrupt handler is immediately branched into by the processor typically hanging off of the call stack of whatever code was previously running. Modern OSes that supports process preemption install an interrupt handler on an event tied to a counterafter so many counter ticks pause the program and run this function which then calls into the scheduler saves the program state and switches it out for a different process. System calls also depend on interrupts and interrupt handlers in the case of the sysenter instruction its the same theory of operation as interrupts but optimized for a userkernel context transition. The interrupt handler for system calls dispatches the system call to the relevant kernel code and may incur a process change when handling the system callfor example the sleep function exists purely to force the kernel to run some other process or thread.Further hardware support that OSes exploit includes the use of virtual memory addresses. Virtual memory was initially designed to separate out processes from each other each process can only see its own memory region which it thinks is its own due to logical address mapping. Special memory regions track mappings of addresses that the process use to the actual underlying memory addresses in RAM. This allows for noncontiguous allocation and full process separation although this can be changed at the OS layer. Later hardware support for paging was used to exploit storage on the disk as swap memory which we still see today. Finally Id like to note that ubolches explanation of how libraries work also somewhat applies to the Linux kernel. Kernel modules are ELF files that the kernel loads into its own address space dynamically and all of the same library call mechanics apply in kernel space as well. When people talk about bare metal on a CPU very little of what the CPU offers is truly bare metal. Memory is completely virtualized in user space and lets not even get into the multiple levels of caching that go on instructions regularly get turned off in user space and all of the interesting hardware access for example make this pixel that color tends to go through the kernel at one point or another through system calls. Even the notion of linear execution isnt strictly true because the CPU paired with the OS scheduler can pause and resume your process in the middle of it executing. ,linux,dduhuub,7,t5_2qh1a
10810792,0,t1_ddtfiey,Ive had the same experience as you able to completely do as I please in the tech space without ever getting a hard time from anyone. On the contrary Ive received a lot of support.However even if a person hasnt be told by tech people theyre no good they might still have been treated poorly due to gender in other spaces. This absolutely does happen for both men and women in areas where theyre in the minority gender. They might then see that tech is  dudes and mistakenly think thats because women arent welcome based on their experiences elsewhere. Programs and awards like that are a great way of letting people know thats not the case. I agree it will never be    because the reality is not as many women  are interested but I absolutely think there are people who would feel more confident to get involved if the message is loud and clear they are invited.That is especially true in this case given theyre trying to encourage participation in open source projects which are typically team based. Someone might be a great coder in their own private space but not feel confident enough to be the only female in a group. Things like this help to encourage people to get involved.This is not about men are sexist because I would and do say all the same things about supporting men in areas in which they encounter sexism such as parenting nursing recourse if theyre victims of domestic violence to name a few. Additionally plenty of women are sexist towards both men and other women and in many cases visciously so. There shouldnt be any sense of heaping blame on the entire male gender because doing so is flawed in every way.Men and women are working together to break down outdated gender restrictions so people can fulfil their personal potential and this to me is a part of helping that happen.

So in general youre asking for a paradox.gt Also Id like for the license to not be viral and allow static compilation.Copyleft in general  protects your freedoms. Using the word viral is contradicting the word copyleft in some senses. There is the LGPL which is a weaker copyleft or the MPLv which is particularly weak and not very effective or well used. It is unique in that it has per file copyleft but in practice this doesnt matter so much because you can put your proprietary code in a separate file.gt From my experience copyleft licenses are much longer and often very complicated as opposed to simple licenses like zlib.Dont use zlib.

So even if you have a fully open source HDL implementation of the ISA you still need to invest lots of money in the actual design of the IC because you want to actually do the ASIC design to deliver competitive prices that people can actually pay.And if you do the ASIC design lets say its not a custom ASIC then its not just a drawing its a specific design that uses the specific devices offered by the factory transistors logic devices ... which probably would not allow sharing their parameters publicly and so the whole design will have NDA tied up with it unless you plan to have an open source billion  FAB.gtwhat scenario you were imagining one would just replace that IC with another.I didnt quite understand your question but my point regarding the license of the HDL is that if a company basing their IC on a specific HDL design that is infringing a patent and put lots of money in NRE and now the patent infringement was found then it mean much more money needed to be invested in order to roll devices out of the factory for redesigning and confirmation more NREs before selling a single device for a computer CPU its probably millions of USD for just manufacturing the new ASIC mask.The fact that people use GPLcopyleft licenses for these projects is misleading as no one really researched and confirmed that there are no patent infringements in the HDL implementation or needed to implement the ISA that makes the whole idea of manufacturing an IC based on this ISA and the HDL implementation a gamble a very costly gamble which can be avoided by licensing IPs from reputable companies like ARM Imagination and etc.,linux,de9n351,1,t5_2qh1a

Static binaries were invented when Sun and Berkeley codeveloped shared libraries and there needed to be binaries that you knew would work before shared libraries were available during boot before things were all mounted during recovery etc.It always amazed me when someone looks at computer systems of the s through the lens of todays technology and then projects a failure of imagination on the part of those engineers back in the s.

11033405,0,t1_deiajr2,In certain scenarios Octave can be  or  times slower than Matlab. Its impossible to fix such gaps using hardware. Then theres also the many compatibility problems. When I have a Matlab compatible script I can not be sure that it runs in Octave because not every part of Matlab is implemented in Octave. And since Octave supports a superset of Matlab I can not necessarily run an Octave script in Matlab either.So in my opinion Octave is a dead end. I am much more comfortable in Python with numpy. It is even much faster than Octave especially with optimizations like Numba. And then you have new and fancy initiatives like Julia. I would rather see both Octave and Matlab disappear and be replaced by Python and perhaps Julia.The only thing FOSS can not offer is Simulink capabilities and industry support.

First the two guys interviewing RMS are seemingly a couple of marketing guys who run their webcast like two radio hugsters. I had to skip the first  to get to anything Stallman and I felt within the first couple of minutes that the interview was going to go awry pretty fast as a couple of slick marketers were trying to put words in RMSs mouth and not learn from him glossing over most of his points. I can see how it was going to go bad from that point on.I was in the IT game in  when FSF was started and know that by  the Herd Kernel was having difficulties coming together. I was using commercial UNIX and was interested in having a free UNIX unencumbered by ATampT and Microsoft. I was using GNU software and so I understood the issue. RMS has good reason to be inflexible with the marketing types who try to usurp his message including Sun Microsystems trying to do so by championing what it called Open Source which is not Free and Open software. I worked for Scott MacNealy and he violated the ideas of RMS and many versions of Linux today do as well.If you wanted to know what your graphics driver does how it implements itself on a Nvidia Card on a Linux system you would have great difficulty because Nvidia still hides some parts of its drivers in hex and doesnt publish all the source code. I used to think that RMS was pedantic but after the security flaws in SSL came out and my own challenges with Linux Documentation and support like many application vendors not writing full man pages especially KDE developers I realized that Stallman was largely right If you cant know what your software does you do not control it.,linux,dew0d74,1,t5_2qh1a

At that point we only supported WebMVPVorbis OggTheoraVorbis and Wave as well as MP on Windows and some additional codecs including MPH.AAC on a small number of Android phones. At that time most media in the browser ran in Flash.gtSince then weve added words like MP MP H. VP Opus AAC HEAAC MSE and EME to our vocabulary. DASH and HLS are handled by site Javascript using MSE. A massive amount of effort has gone into making everything parallel so we can get as many pixels to the screen as possible. Were working on platform specific performance improvements on Windows Linux and Mac. Were also doing some work to protect ourselves against driver crashes on Windows and Android.gtWe are seeing an explosion of interest in HTML video and the accompanying audio is going through libcubeb our audio backend. Weve added low latency support to libcubeb for WebAudio and full duplex support so we can use it directly for microphone input for WebRTC.gtOur official Firefox builds on Linux support both PulseAudio and ALSA. There are a number of additional contributed backends that can be turned on at compile time although contribution towards longterm maintenance and matching feature parity with the actively developed backends has been low. On Linux we actively maintain the PulseAudio backend but we also approach the PulseAudio developers when we see issues in PulseAudio. The PulseAudio developers are generally good to work with.gtThe most problematic backend across all platforms is ALSA. It is also missing full duplex support. We are intending to add multichannel . support across all platforms and the ones that dont make the cut will be the ALSA backend and the WinMM backend used on Windows XP.gtOur ALSA backend has fallen behind in features it is buggy and difficult to fix. PulseAudio is contrastingly low maintenance. I propose discontinuing support for ALSA in our official builds and moving it to offbydefault in our official builds.gtLeaving all the ALSA code in tree gives people the opportunity to continue maintaining the ALSA backend. Reenabling it would require bringing it up to the same standard as other backends not only in terms of current state but also in terms of consistency of contribution.gtAs a long time Linux user I want to get the most value out of our efforts on Linux. I can do that by focusing our efforts on the things that will have the greatest impact. Sometimes that requires taking a step back and deciding to do one thing well instead of two things poorly.gtJust to be clear Im proposing we stop spending time on ALSA so we can spend that time on adding . audio support to our PulseAudio backend.   I believe they also did a telemetry study and found that less than  of users on Linux were not using Pulse Audio.,linux,df1iwym,531,t5_2qh1a

Those writes would take some time and while they happened other processes running on the computer could be creating new pending writes assuming here sync wouldnt keep checking for new pending writes or it could be playing cat and mouse forever.So when the first sync exited there could be some new pending writes but probably less than before as these were only from while the sync was running. The second sync would finish much faster as fewer writes should be pending and the third one even faster.So multiple syncs could be a way to minimize those leftover writes as issuing sync wouldnt stop new writes to be requested just force the pending ones to happen.this is just an educated guess Ive no source for that,linux,dfqvuss,5,t5_2qh1a

Many of these had file formats in common so you could use one package for the bulk of the typing but another one for the layout and bibliography work.With spreadsheets you could do your layouts and formulas in one but do the plots and charts in another. The workflow in these cases was filecentric and you used the best tool you had for the job. You got tools to work on your data you didnt just use whatever proprietary roachmotel file formats that Microsoft wanted to give you.This changed over time and the concept of a raster image editing program was replaced with the genericized verb photoshop.

Yes precisely you could probably compile these programming languages into javascript thats the thing which is nonsensical.gt Its almost as if I was showing an example of another scripting lanauge read macro in word is comparable to JS in HTML.Giving an example of another document format which contains an extension which provides a turing complete scripting language doesnt answer why does a document format need a turing complete scripting language.gt Still were using mongrol FREETARD logic.More irrelevant personal attacks because you still cant provide a reason why entire applications need to run in web browsers.gt I AM TOO FUCKING STUPID TO LITTERALLY READ THE OUTPUT OF A DECOMPILER THAT CAN STEP ME THROUGH HOW THE CODE IS RUNNING BUT LET ME CALL YOUR CLAIMS IDIOTIC AS I MANUALLY COMB THROUGH OBFUSTOCATED CODE XDDDDIm not sure which decompilers youve used in your life but even the output of software as sophisticated as HexRays Decompiler is harder to read than obfuscared source since not only do you lose all the names of your variables and the code is basically obfuscated you lose all the structure of the original source. Something tells me you have never actually decompiled and attempted to reverse engineer a real world large project.Also more personal attacks when you could be explaining why we need to run our programs in a web browser.gt hmm think of it like this. Did you have to redownload reddit  download a update when they added new features or just hit the refresh button  just use it?You get updates instantly but they dont get audited by a package maintainer first or scrutinized by multiple people first changes could be pushed out even secretly this completely and absolutely negates any benefits.gt I cant remember the name but Java did something like this and failed horribly.I dont follow give details.gt Better ensure the dependencies are here then!Not necessary but still I think the approach is wrong. Software should be going through maintainers.gt People who write in Electron are worse than freetards SJWs and poltics in programming.But theyre leveraging this technology you love so much to decouple their application from a browser... by putting it in another browser. It sounds like a great use of resources.gt A Sandybridge i m struggling with the modern web? really? Tell that to my Elitebook p with gb of RAM that flies. Same CPU half the RAM.It must be struggling even harder.gt Maybe you should stop using FireFox until they fix the performance issues and go to UnGoogled Chromium like I did.I am sorry but nice fonts are very important when reading documents and thats something which chromium and chrome dont provide. As well as a lack of numerous other features I also dont use either chromium or firefox but qutebrowser since it provides a sane document viewing interface.gt Recycle Use a better browser and dont browse the web if you want to use cycles for better uses.Recycle what?Better in this case is highly subjective and the reason we have a number of competing browsers.gt Linus has real logic.Pretending like linus is infallible is a great way to make yourself look serious.I dont see what RMS and Linus and some categorical dismissal or acceptance of all things said by one or the other helps show in this scenario. Youre just making yourself look like an asshole.gt Now make a GUI in them that works from platform to platform from low DPI to HiDPi almost everywhere.There are plenty of widget toolkits which already do this however the simple fact is that development in THIS direction is far more productive than development of web browsers.Additionally CSS never solved HiDPi by doing idiotic things like allowing the use of pixel measurements now we have the infernal mess called web pixels which means that CSS pixels arent even real pixels anymore.You can either make a tool which already does a poor job of solving  problems make an even poorer job of solving  problems or you can make another tool which solves the actual problem much better.The idiotic approach is to try to use already poorly performing web browsers to write even slower programs you could just instead write these programs using portable tools and make them run faster natively.,linux,dgmyyfn,1,t5_2qh1a

Obviously in an ideal world youd just alert on usage and automate log rotation but occasionally for e.g. theres rd party closedsource modules that kick the bucket and spew GBs of logs at am. Theres also a few failure modes like running out of inodes in  that can prevent you logging in to fix problems. sshd and login just give up.

11746490,0,t3_67l6xz,This is more so about why I choose Gentoo or rather Portage this certainly does not apply to all  systems that are built on top of Linux and glibc.. I side with Linux on the whole syscall vs filesystem debate. While proc and sys on Linux are a fucking mess that needs overhaul its still better than having to use syscalls in languages that have no bindings so you suddenly have to use the FFI to the libc. I would rather that Linux go even further in this and also make things llike prctl available though proc. It is simply such an elegant simple and clean interface to use normal filesystem operations to interface with the kernel that way.. I am absolutely not a fan of the whole base system design though Gentoo FreeBSD managed to take FreeBSD and modularized the monolithic base system this is still a project in its infancy. The base system is very monolithic and the developers rule the show yes you can hack about it to change it in theory but its unsupported and can easily break. GNU software is far more thorough than FreeBSD software. GNU utilities are far more optimized in general and offer far more convenient flags. They indeed tend to take more memory but are also significantly faster. Theres also a lot of GNU stuff I purposefully avoid though.. I very much like the Debianstyle approach. The distinction between base system and add on software is arbitrary and Debianstyle package management does not make it. It distinguishes between critical packages and noncritical as in packages without which the package manager itself cannot run so if you remove those the system becomes internally unrecoverable. BSDs are very unclear about what is critical and what isnt youre just not supposed to mess with the base system at all.. BSDs have very few policies and promises for the future in what they are going to change and how long what is going to remain stable.. BSDs simply offer less choice because the systems are monolithic. The reason these systems fragment aggressively offering a large amount of choice is because all utilities are designed to be modular which makes it considerably easier to start a new system by packing a bunch of shit together. on BSDs everything assumes the rest so you either fork the entire OS or you dont. The latest big Linux desktop system that has gotten prominence is Void which is not a fork. They saw a need for something and they packages a bunch of stuff together that was designed to be able to run in isolation and it worked and the system has generally been praised for its clean approach to things and answers a real need.Note that a lot of systems like say Arch essentially have a base system in the same way as the BSDs except without the consistency benefit of it being developed by one group thus being more consistent but with all of the weaknesses in flexibility.,linux,dgrht27,15,t5_2qh1a

No. They only make CentOS binaries available and those may not be binary compatible with RHEL.You can ftp to Red Hats website and compile all of their source RPMs. Without a contract of any sort.
