115656,0,t1_cerl5xe,Wow looking at that last link remember summer?I think the protected lanes make sense on select streets downtown but not this far northwest. I remember how surprised I was that Northwest highway had a bike lane. I was also the only cyclist in it from Milwaukee to Harlem. And thats what really stinks to me. Why is it so important all of a sudden to make those lanes protected in that particular stretch? Is this a Rahm thing? Is it Arena thinking food trucks bike lanes and a beard is what is most important for the ward? Is it a union thing so the street guys are working? It certainly has nothing to do with bicyclists because there arent any there and theres already a lane. ,ChicagoNWside,cerlmm4,8,t5_2z0xv
759211,0,t1_cgpqi0m,Agreed and on point.  In fact the foundational issue for the FAiR Coalition www.fairchicago.org is that you me and us as citizens had no real say in how the October  new takeoff and landing patterns at OHare were put together. These changes have had a negative impact on the residents of the NW side and near NW suburbs and to add insult to injury is they were made without any real community input. Our issue then is one of democracy first and plane noise and pollution second. Whether the noise and pollution issue resonates with a person or not is because we all have those things that are more or less important to us go to www.fairchicago.org and read our Policy Statement to learn more about the issue. That is what it is. However we must all be concerned and vigilant as citizens when major decisions are made by government elected and appointed with no real community input. This starting grievance is then aggravated when elected and appointed officials are repeatedly approached to engage in community dialog yet both refuse and rebut the efforts of those governed. In these cases our grievance is compounded and instantly right regardless of the matter at hand.I invite you then as citizens to join FAiR at www.fairchicago.org. Sign our online petition and report your noise complaints can be done directly through our website too. Tell your neighbors about how our democracy has again been imperiled. Still have questions? Please ask. Jac Charlier  jac.charliergmail.com See you around our neighborhood.,ChicagoNWside,cgqkukm,2,t5_2z0xv

2177308,0,t3_2jsa0o,JacI have been attempting to contact Alderman Colon who has affected constituents in this area including constituents that span into the West Walker community since May st with no effort.I just sent his chief of staff Martha the following emailMarthaI originally contacted the th ward office on this matter on May st.  The office didnt respond.  I again contacted the office on this matter on June th.  You responded on June rd stating We will request for information on air traffic reports in your area.  Upon reviewing the information we will get back to you on the results of the assessment of this matter.  Four months later I still do not have any comment.  I find this very very frustrating.Last night I attended a West Walker community meeting th Ward spans into the West Walker community that focused on the noise problem we are facing.  The discussion panel consisted of Jac Charlier representing FAIR coalition U.S. Representative Mike Quigley Alderman Arena and Alderman Laurino and had about  community members in attendance.  Rep. Quigley Alderman Arena and Alderman Laurino have constituents that span into the West Walker community.  Both Alderman Arena and Alderman Laurino acknowledged our problem and what they are doing for us and that they support the FAIR coalition.  I noticed that Alderman Colon who does have constituents affected by the noise in this area was not in attendance.In  estimated to be September or October a new east west runway aligned with Berteau Ave with the lowest ceiling yet for a runway that will impact our area.  Its projected that the opening of this runway will significantly increase noise in our area.I am asking again is Alderman Colon aware of the problems we are facing? Does he support the FAIR Coalition?  And what is he doing for his affected constituents in this area?,ChicagoNWside,clgl7np,2,t5_2z0xv
