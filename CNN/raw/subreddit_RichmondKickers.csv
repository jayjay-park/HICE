11654204,0,t3_66alrq,Im not really affiliated with the club or the River City Red Army this is actually my first time seeing this sub. Seems somewhat dead so Ill give my two cents. The Red Army has their own canopy set up and a grill too Im pretty sure probs wont be an issue. The only issue might be finding a spot to set up. As far as seating and specifically for away fans it is GA but Ive never seen many organized away fans except from DCU for the open cup. The stadium only has open seating on one side the big bleachers on the other side are closed off still I believe. Usually when DCU comes they on the opposite end of the Red Army which would be the far left when facing the field the Red Army sits in section O on the far right. Ive only seen one game this season and went to a handful last year and before that went to about every game so take that for what its worth. If you havent already Id recommend reaching out to the Kickers or Red Army via twitter to figure something out. Also to the Red Army Ill be joining you all in section o this weekend looking forward to it! And feel free to correct tf out of me if Im wrong.Edit in recent years that far left end has been deemed the family friendly zone so Im not sure how the Kickers would want to manage an away supporters section thats why I mentioned to reach out to someone more directly.,RichmondKickers,dgh0oei,2,t5_2w6gm
