1583910,0,t1_cjdwajz,Ideally you should find natural places to break up paragraphs so that you dont end up with big walls of text but the breaks dont feel abrupt and arbitrary. Heres an example using a paragraph that i thought ran a bit longI love my rice cooker. Its the appliance I use the most partly because its just so handy. When I first got it I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean its a machine that makes rice and a few other grains. its not like it was hard to make those before right?The breakthrough for me was realizing how much easier it could make my life. I could make my grains ahead of time and they would stay warm and ready until dinner. I also learned that you can make more than just plain rice or quinoa. Beans veggies and spices can all be tossed in with the uncooked rice for the perfect base to a meal.You coild even break it up further by putting a break after the second sentence of paragraph one and two.I know its tough to break out of rules like paragraphs must comtain at least three sentences that you had driven into your head in school. But the goals for blog writing are different than those of formal and essay writing and the end result doesnt have to feel choppy.Aside from that in some places you just need to put an extra line break in so that paragraphs dont end up coming right after the previous one.,Blogging,cjetosm,1,t5_2qhjr

Bloggers who do reviews have to decide if they want to be a principled voice of the community or are they are just in it for the free stuff.  I know several bloggers who arent trying to be journalistic and consider it an avenue for getting gear not much different than couponing or haunting sales.

2710543,0,t1_cnc5l1t,What I mean is that its better to set goals for actions rather than outcomes because actions are  in your control  you do them or you dont. Outcomes arent necessarily in your control because even if you do all the actions you never know maybe Google will change its algorithms or some new expensive tool will get developed that gives others an edge over you or your site will get hacked and end up on some blacklist or even just what you do simply isnt as effective as you had predicted and you wont achieve your outcomes. Then you end up feeling bad for not meeting your goals even though you did put the work in and should have the uplifting emotions that come with completing tasks. And you never know doing the actions you need to achieve outcome A might end up giving you outcome B instead or as well. Plus having actions as your goals develops discipline and gets you into a taskbased frame of mind instead of an outcomebased frame of mind which can be more productive and satisfying and puts you more in control.,Blogging,cnc6els,1,t5_2qhjr

4477098,0,t1_csuy6np,Content is the most important thing. OP if you are in fact just starting your blog I would consider waiting until youve been at it for a month or two to start promoting your blog. More posts will give readers more to look at and a better sense of the quality and consistency of your writing.That said just writing the content and hoping readers will find it and spread the word on their own is like opening a store and hoping that foot traffic and word of mouth will make up the fact that that you havent done any advertising. Sometimes it can work. Sometimes you have a blogger who stumbles on a niche thats so underserved that theres a builtin audience just waiting to consume and promote it. Sometimes the blogger has already done a bunch of the work beforehand simply by being interested in the topic and contributing to the online communities that exist for it so that his or her name is a selling point when the blog launches. Or maybe the blogger just has the discipline to keep writing hundreds of posts that very few people are reading until something hits big or word of mouth slowly gets around. But in most cases great content combined with good self promotion will get a blog more readers than simply producing a lot of beautiful content that no one knows is there.Obviously you dont want to let the tail wag the dog and end up spending all your time promoting instead of writing. But if you set aside some time for getting involved in the community relevant to your blog topic and putting your name and your blog out there you can let potential readers know what youve got and build your audience. If your content is strong hopefully your readers will start doing promotion for you and you can spend less time on promotion and more time on writing. But when youre just starting out you need to let people know your blog exists.,Blogging,csv0afi,1,t5_2qhjr
4483330,0,t1_csvs6f3,You can create custom channels for each of your ad spaces through Google Adsense. Essentially it just means you take each ad space on your blog and describe it in more detail. Like where is it placed? Above the fold? Below the fold? What sort of content do you write and what are your readers interested in? Adding this level of detail to your ad spaces will give a better idea of the worth of your spots to the advertiser.. resulting in increased bids and a general lift in CPMCPC.Heres a guide on how to do that.

4721935,0,t3_3fln0z,I completely understand what you mean. First things first. What kind of blog are u thinking about? Is it along the lifestyle genres of travel food etc which is design heavy? If it is design image oriented I would strongly suggest you use Wordpress. And to begin with use the free version. You can always migrate content if you decide to move to an individual domain. ampnbspThe biggest issue with blogger is what you worry about that it could pull the plug on you. Its happened to me because someone had raised a complaint and the person who had an issue had mistaken my blog for another or some such thing But having said that you can also request for your blog to be reinstated but it is rather tedious. now with Wordpress even the free oneYou get access a lot of customisation optionsFar more themes available and contrary to popular opinion very easy to use.ampnbspBut the negatives with the free version are that you cant do Adsense integration and you cant add a huge range of widgets and plugins like SEO related stuff. But thats just content creation. You will have to also think about marketing and traffic building once you have a few posts up. All the best! ,Blogging,ctpqmf4,2,t5_2qhjr

Some blogposts are referrals to other articles and some blogposts have pretty good content. Just a quick note that you might want to add some headers here and there.Overall it looks like a great start. Try to limit yourself at posting links to other sites it wont help your blog and you will drive traffic away instead of keeping it at your blog. Up next try to scale your articles a bit. Preferable you should make them k words per article. The content of the articles looks really good and your writing style is very nice.

A couple of general tips that should work for everyone Follow and engage with your peers in your field as well as leaders but not so much that you come across as desperate for attention or unhingedjust comment on their posts when you have something substantial to contribute to the conversation share their posts when it makes sense to do so tag them in yours if youre mentioning them etc.  Create and share unique and valuable content whenever you can not just links to your latest blog post. People will be more likely to follow you if youre giving them something of value when they look at your feed. For example I do a lot of minireviews and tips on my Instagram account that are not on my blog so following me there is like getting bonus content.  Engage with the followers that you do have.

I would suggest changing the logo to something more minimal and pleasant on the eye. Also adding background images to your featured image might help. Your front page looks a little bland with your feature images having base color backgrounds. My third suggestion is to add a variation in your text styles in your body content. A sentence or two ever line is good but it makes for a much more digestible read if theres some bold italics and HHH in there.Again Im not the best blogger source  and you probably know more about blogging than me but theres an outside perspective.

I believe that many brands are looking for seamless cobranded experiences. Approach brands that you think align well with your content and mission. Be creative and find ways to integrate your content with their brand. Figure out the market price for your services and always put yourself in their shoes. Customer service and accountability go a long way. Also a visually rich media kit is a good way to introduce your site and provide analyticsdemographic details and show examples of successful sponsored campaigns from the past.,Blogging,d45szk8,4,t5_2qhjr

10391353,0,t1_dclt5ly,Actually they arent users  theyre bots right now. I had some users from post loop portal where you pay them a few cents for each post but that got expensive when Im just a hobby blogger and not in it to make money. As for the forums theyre just sitting in a subdomain like www.yoursiteforums. Its a separate software. Im using mybb I like it except that to update a new version you must go through your web host Im used to being able to update a program like wordpress all from the admin dashboard and this is a big drawback to mybb  also the plugins and themes are not compatible from version to version so sometimes youre stuck using older software or deciding to lose some functions. and the bots are an RSS importer widget  whose name I cant remember  And then I took the entire forum RSS feed which you can get in the admin panel of mybb  and used a wordpress plugin called Feedzy and put the Feedzy widget in my sidebar. And viola it shows the most recent wordpress posts.   and I went a bit crazy with too many RSS feeds which drove away like the maybe  or  real people I had posting there lol. But you know its still more pages for google to index and they are on topic to my site  I actually havent done much with the forums and kinda gave up on it more or less. Its not perfect though because they still would need to register once arriving at the forums even if theyre registered and logged into the blog. There are plugins to fix this such as php unicorn and BBbridge. But they are outdated by a few years last I checked... For now it gives at least the illusion of activity and sometimes that can be enough to get people motivated to leave a comment or join a forum as well. I need to overhaul it and probably update it again but meh... hard to be motivated.I also feel like people dont engage with my blog either but I know theyre reading stuff on average I get  unique visitors a day Today was a good day with over  visitors yay and I see them subscribe and a few have left comments here or there One person even said they were an avid reader which made me pretty happy but thats definitely the biggest challenge getting people to post comments on the stuff I put out. Prior to this back in about  I was running a social media site using buddypress wordpress plugin which is free. It was cool like my own mini facebook but getting active users was really tough. I dont have many friends IRL most geeky gamer types dont to be honest so I didnt have a single person using the site at first but eventually got quite a few by my standards like maybe  users  but I just got boredtired of it.I decided what I really wanted to do was just write for the sake of writing as opposed to moderating a large well small really lol social media site and stop caring as much if anyone was actually reading anything  so I let that domain expire though Im pretty sure its still accessible as a subdomain on my main server right now and instead focused my time and energy into my blog.Ive found happiness and relaxation and peace just blogging for the sake of blogging about things I like and want to share with others. Recently within the last  months it has also turned into a nice side income  In december made about  from various sponsored posts. Which yeah isnt much but for a hobby that Im doing because I really like the topic and just love to write its like an added bonus to see sponsors occasionally want to pay me. Ill also occasionally accept guest posts for free if theyre like me just another hobby blogger in the gaming or anime niche and not a company trying to sell a product or service . Anyways as for running a forum I havent been successful yet but people always say to just join other forums in your niche and put yours in your sig and also to ask moderators if theyd like to do post exchanges where you post X number of times on their forums and they return the favor back to you  Ive tried all of those things and didnt see too many lasting results. I think forums are largely a dying form of communicaton as larger sites like Reddit which is kinda a forum in and of itself or Facebook and Twitter seem to have taken the place of traditional forums. Even in the case of a highly successful forum its generally one for which theres a specific audienceniche and one that has been around for years or one that has some gamification aspects like Gaia or otherwise offers something different out there. Which is a shame because a lot of forums can be really fun and more personal than larger sites where discussions move more quickly such as facebook and twtter.Edit to add If using Wordpress probably the easiest way to add a forum is with the plugin bbPress  I just didnt like the lookfeel of it so thats why I opted for mybb even though I knew it wouldnt be completely seamless to my blog. There are countless other free wordpress plugins or free forum software  but bbPress is one of the most popular and updated frequently still by the dev team. ,Blogging,dclxbx8,1,t5_2qhjr

11144068,0,t1_dev5zh2,I mean personally I dont know if what I feel like writing about is going to be worth monetizing. It isnt going to be a hobbyactivity blog.

11219234,0,t1_df0hf9l,gt should I have a reason to distrust wix overall?Many of my friends have created pages with Wix. Wix isnt technically wrong. The problem is that the big players dont take Wixsites seriously. If you want to use Wix you absolutely need a custom domain name.gt Is it something that I need to worry about later on if they ever try to take my site? Is this even a real concern?No.gt Ive heard stories of sites being deleted and held random but it seems like maybe times have changed or this wasnt really a thing?Happens mostly in two cases You consume too much bandwidth or you post something against their interest like politics religion.Something like Wix can be good to start with but when you get the budget have your website designer professionally.,Blogging,df3oppb,1,t5_2qhjr

11331626,0,t3_61pxoi,I can say from experience Ive stopped following a lot of people because they posted stuff that wasnt about why I followed them. I feel like combining those niches would cause you to lose whatever followers you did gain. If you want to make money from the site your only real option is to buy a domain . for first year on GoDaddy get promo code on RetailMeNot and get a small hosting plan. The hatchling plan on HostGator should be fine starting out. Thats like month  month if you want a custom email i.e. newsletteryourdomain.com which I would recommend for growing an email list,Blogging,dfgf5nl,2,t5_2qhjr

11490848,0,t3_640qda,The proper way to cite depends on the license you have to use the image in the first place. Some image licenses require citationscredit while some dont.You cant just use an image without permission and then cite it. If its not an image you created or an image that you have permission to use from the person who did then using it will be a copyright infringement whether its cited or not.As far as using images at all yes they will help the overall aesthetic of your site and they will help you get better search engine rankings too.,Blogging,dfyhijr,5,t5_2qhjr

11722565,0,t1_dgofhrk,people do browse social media at work but not as much. the reason why i chose to post it at night is if you post it early during the day it will eventually be buried by the time more people look at their feed at night. as opposed to posting it at night it will instantly pop out on their feed once you do post it. however if you do post it during the day there is still a possibility it will still get more views because some people dont have a lot of friends or their friends dont post a lot of stuff so it will always stay on their feed. it really depends on the situation.,Blogging,dgos72f,2,t5_2qhjr

11753169,0,t1_dgs8y39,Its not duplicate content if you use. Search engines use canonical links to determine and prioritize the ultimate source of content removing confusion when there are multiple copies of the same document in different locations. Sites that publish an over abundance of duplicate content without indicating a canonical link may be penalized in search engine rankings.Mediums publication and crossposting pathways automatically add canonical links to protect your original content posted offsite. This means that Medium can only boost  not cannibalize  your SEO.Read about it here,Blogging,dgs91xv,3,t5_2qhjr
