4600391,0,t1_ctagikx,Have you tried running the benchmark utility thats in XTU? That one should show a more substantial difference between stock and OC speeds.,hpenvyphoenix,ctagvag,1,t5_396wi
4607451,0,t3_3e3wb3,Hi. Im the one that posted the psu screenshot.  Few questions for you.  You said there are  pcix slots. Is it the one above the existing video card that is x?  If so isnt there other stuff blocking the ability to put a nd full length card into that or you think the clearance is ok?Thats interesting that you got a delta watts while i got a liteon watts.  I would prob trust delta more when it comes to psus.  Wonder if it has anything to do with the video card we got and the total power needed i got kgtx.I got a  marks in the XTU benchmark but only after ocing all  cores to ghz and pushing C so starting at  without oc is pretty darn good. Any idea which of the usb ports are  so i can tape them up? ,hpenvyphoenix,ctbcq3c,1,t5_396wi

Itll take short cards from what I saw. keep in mind I only removed my intercooler bc my pump was making gurgling noises so I needed to move the rad round to try and get the air bubble out. With that said I didnt take a good hard look at those slots. Id recommend you just unscrew the rad and take a look. Its just  screws and boom its off. You wont hurt anything. ,hpenvyphoenix,cty02mb,1,t5_396wi
6171876,0,t1_cyi5yij,Its a custom software layer Samsung wrote that runs atop Windows and uses the system RAM  so the more you have the better  as a readwrite buffer so it can go much faster than the SATA connection itself maxes out at. In other words say you need to save a GB file the rapid mode software pours that into memory  which is very very very fast compared to even an SSD  and then trickles it onto the SSD in the background asynchronously letting you continue w your workload as soon as it finishes loading to RAM hope that makes sense. Thx again. My Envy arrives today excited to get going w it.,hpenvyphoenix,cyr6fkg,1,t5_396wi
