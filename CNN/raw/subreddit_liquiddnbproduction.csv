3124632,0,t3_2vviip,To be honest samples will sound best. VST emulation of a saxophone doesnt have the same feel. Your voice affects the tone. You can use single shot samples and assign them to different keys in a sample based instrument to give it a more natural feel. Check out Ambient Skyline sample packs for some great liquidy saxophone and horn samples.,liquiddnbproduction,colv7xl,3,t5_36b9i
3251543,0,t1_cornvh3,gt I agree with bigpumps on the snare perhaps add another higher layer to the snare instead of raising the volume.I also agree with areasontolivednb about the Glitch lead. Its a cool concept I wouldnt entirely ditch the stem  try eq fading the glitch in order to give the main sample take the lead. great sample,liquiddnbproduction,coz15mu,2,t5_36b9i
