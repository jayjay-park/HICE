7010108,0,t3_4bnvzl,Unfortunately there are no quick fixes. If you search around this board and hppdonline you will find more postscomments outlining what you need to do to get better. Most importantly though you have to stop using drugs permanently Weed MDMA LSD Coke etc.. ,HPPD,d1axxc5,1,t5_2qlvv
7138193,0,t1_d19617w,I think when I first found out that it was essentially permanent always in the background it seemed a little overwhelming. I remember saying to myself Congratulations youve really fucked yourself over this time but despite spending a disproportionate amount of time thinking about it it hasnt really phased me. I worry about my vision as I intend to become a pilot if it kills me but apart from that it hasnt bothered me of recent. The difficulty lies in drug use. I spend months doing nothing in my flat no one to meet because theyre all doing drugs. Ive fucked my head up far too much to meet new people and it just feels awkward like Im some kind of burden on them I dont like feeling like I owe someone so I just dont bother. This last year of perpetual excessive has left me relearning how the world works. Eventually I just think this is no quality of life then I announce Im getting on it all my mates want to meet then the next day I cant even read the posters on my wall and Im just thinking cunt. But I only have myself to blame on that front. In conclusion the HPPD isnt so much of a problem until I have to compare it to when it was relatively benign. Im pretty similar in that regard loathe people talking of autistic people as if were clones but I have to admit but Ive learned to scrutinise myself so Im not so impulsive. I also have ADHD attention defecit hyperactivity disorded and APD auditory processing disorder so Ive had to counteract that with constant reflection and selfanalysis to avoid additional difficulties in adulthood. It can be a pain as well as a hurdle within itself but it beats prison. Its ironic if you take the first letter of each of my mental disorders it spells HAAA. ,HPPD,d1pj9r5,1,t5_2qlvv

8930192,0,t1_d7i20o5,Of course its not an hppd symptom but the whole stretching and warping thing never happened to me prior to hppd so its changed in a way,HPPD,d7l9zun,1,t5_2qlvv
9357142,0,t3_58lu6f,I got mine from acid I have palinopsia but I have other things aswell like walls are breathing I see geometric patterns with my eyes closed and halos and auras about everything with even a little bit of light on it also static  the trails and afterimages are by far the worst tho hands down Im glad they never got TOO bad but I think the breathing walls static and ghosting l halos and cevs made up for my lack of extensive trails and afterimages after writing this tho I can look up and see lines from where I was just typing for a good  seconds ,HPPD,d9232tx,1,t5_2qlvv

9694041,0,t1_da7u5pd,I know its a good coping mechanism but drinking will only prolong the issues youre having. For the best results I can only advocate complete sobriety but I recognize no one is perfect.,HPPD,da7zvmf,1,t5_2qlvv
9698057,0,t3_5dr7k2,Im so happy to hear this!! Me too actually! My DPDR is getting so much better from quitting weed and having a healthy mindest. And yeah my main symptom is the colors too. Theyre too damn bright lol.,HPPD,da8hq0v,1,t5_2qlvv

10230941,0,t1_dc3pqyj,Yeah I did also read about a person who obtained visual snow and after images from Prozac a while back. If I remember correct the doctors managed to find out his retinas or something was detached due to some odd interaction with the medication. This apparently cured his vision. I also wonder if maybe glasses contacts are something eye related can help sooth the distortions. Maybe even fix them if the eyes get a break from constant stimuli.,HPPD,dc3qg8j,1,t5_2qlvv

10241578,0,t1_dc4rw2o,They may never go away but they can fade into the background where you no longer notice them and have anxiety answer me this if you were born with these visual alternations from birth would you have such a problem with them? The answer is no the only reason we suffer from it is because we are scared of it. Learn to accept it and your life will improve dramatically!,HPPD,dc4xuk4,1,t5_2qlvv
10272738,0,t1_dc89thh,same.. stayed home this whole year.. time for a change in !,HPPD,dc8gysn,1,t5_2qlvv
10869354,0,t1_de0p02j,Yes thats certainly a side effect that comes with any anxiety disorder or even a depressive state. You tend to overthink things and dwell on the more unfortunate things in life however this can be avoided by developing a healthy lifestyle with appropriate diet and exercise. I know thats an extremely redundant thing on forums like these but it is somewhat true. This ties into the serotonin issue because excersise itself and activities which cause you to get really involved naturally up regulate receptors and create new connections. However what Im proposing is that there ARE medicinal ways to do this in the long run too. Either way its best not to focus and worry on these things for too long do what makes u happy but also make some healthy changes to get out of the zone youre in. ,HPPD,de13hfq,1,t5_2qlvv
10883251,0,t1_de1p4mo,Based off my hypothesis which may or may not be valid any substance with anti serotogenic effects would be valid some of these include antispsychotics but those should most likely be avoided in our case as they block almost all receptors atypical antipsychotics may however prove useful in the long run. Many people here believe all antipsychotics should be avoided atypicals tho which are not used primarily for psychosis may increase binding after long term use. Other drugs use this mechanism just look up serotonin antagonists. As far as herbs go I know that feverfew antagonizes the hta receptor,HPPD,de2j383,1,t5_2qlvv
11126000,0,t3_5yqwza,Id prefer staying on anonymous platforms. Though it might be good for awareness I cant imagine anyone wanting to talk about this with his real name attached to in public. Its not like we cant have support groups its just that public facebook groups are not the way to go. Reddit with its upvote and comment system is pretty ideal. I cant really think of a better platform. Discord maybe... ,HPPD,det4fdd,1,t5_2qlvv
11135344,0,t3_5yz0vs,Yes Im trying to drink more tea Im also eating  bananas  oranges a day and taking  vitamin c and  multi vitamins a day when I started this my symptoms lessens loads! I also started a sport Im not sure that helped tho I looked at the sky earlier and forgot I had hppd and it was normal then I remembered and it went back  Im trying to stay positive! You all have to stay positive! I am never touching drugs again! Better for a life time of clear vision than  hours of jaw grinding and bliss! Thanks for your help I really appreciate it ! ,HPPD,deu6i6i,1,t5_2qlvv

11277101,0,t1_dfa02py,Yeah bro drinking was my only escape I used to get blind enough to not even give a fuck and it would take the brain fog away the next day you feel a bit funky but you do anyways without hppd then after that nothing I feel completely normal ,HPPD,dfa8rch,1,t5_2qlvv

11525069,0,t1_dg2d48r, This would be your sky static I think. Everyone gets this. As for the light sky static at night I remember having that as a kid I think its just those CEVs on a black screen,HPPD,dg2da25,1,t5_2qlvv

11687140,0,t1_dghklu0,Yes I definitely think mine was totally psychosomatic. Like most of the true sufferers on this site say I think if it was HPPD there would be no question.For me I was suffering from derealization before because of an undiagnosed food allergy and bad anxiety. The symptoms of derealization are very similar to what SOUNDS like HPPD and I only noticed how bad it was a few days after the trip when I was doing one of my OCD reality checks lol. Acid MIGHT have loosened up the wires and made the derealization worse its impossible to say but I definitely dont have proper HPPD.If you also suffered from a kind of naucebo effect this might help your anxiety from TripSit wikiIt is relatively normal to experience persisting effects after a psychedelic experience in some cases but they will usually fade between the period of a few days to a few weeks.Human eyes are naturally given to certain visual abnormalities which are commonly attributed to HPPD but occur for everyone. Many of these effects are somewhat parsed out and most people dont notice them until asked to pay attention it is possible the use of hallucinogenic chemicals makes one more prone to noticing these effects.Eye floaters are naturally occurring effects of the degeneration of the eye which become more frequent as a person grows older. They are also attributed to several medical conditions but are not related to HPPD.Also known as bluesky sprites this effect occurs when a person looks at a large blue light most commonly the sky and presents as bright dots in the visual field which move rapidly on an unpredictable path before disappearing within a few seconds.The appearance of this effect is somewhat comparable to tracers which are a regular visual effect while under the influence of psychedelics.Visual snow is a persistent visual symptom in which people see static similar to that of an analogue television in parts or the entire visual field. The causes of this effect are unknown however it is not considered dangerous and its presence alone is not considered to be a symptom of HPPD. Also everyone sees this all the time.Hope that helps. Ive got bad anxiety too which Im finally dealing with. In that way this has all benefited me though its been a tough way to learn the lesson.,HPPD,dgkr6qe,1,t5_2qlvv
11794003,0,t1_dgwvxdm,Because a lot of the time i feel quite highspacedout especially after meditation just walking around campus and looking at the trees and animals I feel so happy. Its also the depersonalisation. I feel like Im behind my eyes like I am just pure consciousness that is inhabiting a body. Therefore my body is just as much a part of my consciousness as everything else I experience...Quite esoteric but yeah,HPPD,dgww1xi,1,t5_2qlvv
