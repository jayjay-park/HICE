21537,0,t3_1u2r52,This sort of thing has happened to my sister and I on a much much smaller scale. Things like both of us remembering that there was an attic access panel in the ceiling of my closet when we first moved here theres nothing there now no one else remembers this but us and the attic access is actually in the hallway just outside my bedroom.

80157,0,t3_1uatye,I believe that it does open a person. Not everyone but the right personality in the right conditions. I have found myself in that state before. I think that anytime we lower our inhabition or intoxicant ouurselves we are opening up to the unseen. It got pretty bad with me. There was a time when I would black out very frequently and after very little alchohol. I would have no recolection obviosly but during those times I was extreemly animated and just being altogther scary. Looking back I think I was being seriously influenced by some negative forces and they were taking control while I was away. Id use caution if your already having those kinds of impressions. Maybe take a step back. ,Thetruthishere,cenjzcg,2,t5_2sntx

161230,1,t1_cewopdx,You have proved to not be a rational human being as everything youve described has a rational explanation.  I dont care if Im rude this is the internet and I think youre an idiot.  Wont stop me from trying to help you in my own way.Rationality does not mean openmindedness just because you say you are a rational human being does not mean you are not influencing your own experiences in some way.  You sound like your mental state at a certain time dictates what you believe to be normal or not  You were scared by a cassette as a child and then a shadow scared you because it looked like a real man you were thinking about that shadow before bed and had teenage hormones going so one thing lead to another.  Everyone has had one of those sexy dreams and rationalized it in some way but you chose to put the blame on your old boogieman.  Not out of fear but out of fascination and to maybe make your life a little less dull But thats making an assumption.  If youre really after rationality and how to view things differently pick up Michael Shermers book Why People Believe Weird Things I actually had a college class based off this book and it can really open the readers eyes and help them differentiate between real and bullshit.,Thetruthishere,cewspfk,1,t5_2sntx

People still see his lantern over the tracks occasionally.No one knows what these are. Some say they are ghosts. Some say ball lighting. Some say swamp gas.Lights like this are old. They have also been known as Willowisps  spirits that lure travelers into swamps in order to kill them.I dreamed of seeing these when I was kid and read about them in Tar Heel Ghosts.

1004478,0,t3_25lpxc,I hate to say it but this truly does strike me as the stuff of nightmares. As in not reality. Please consider my comment because you may actually be able to get over all of this.First of all this all begins at a point of trauma. You have to realize whats going on here and see a professional. Youre not crazy a lot of people go through this. Worse a lot of other people dont understand it and will judge you for it if you tell them.I dont really believe in them but Ive heard talk about them and how theyre supposed to work. It isnt like this. The circumstances under which you met this demon sound like sleep paralysis and the way he spoke to you sounds like something out of a script. What I do see in what you wrote is actually some reflection of who you are in terms of your concerns and fears. Your mind designed something to frighten you so of course its going to work.Its hard to realize whats really going on when its all laced with such trauma and terror and its almost impossible to step back and tell yourself that it isnt real because youre wired to have great fear for it.As for the demons telling you things that come true... Perhaps its just you thats intuitive. I have a cousin who saw a lot things almost identical to what you described. He got treatment and never struck anyone as abnormal... But he was always kind of mystical. And intuitive perhaps like you. He wasnt sure whether to believe the things he saw and he was always seeing these things. Like you most of the times it wasnt frightening for him other times it was terrifying. But despite being the mystical person he is he recognized them as products of his own mind. Perhaps that too is real in a sense but what it means is that they dont come from hell and they only have the power to affect you and only you have the power to affect them. So take care of it!Also please PM if you want to know more about the mystical side of my cousins account.,Thetruthishere,chigtnc,28,t5_2sntx

1237644,0,t3_287cek,Here is an explanation about how visual processing works How Vision WorksYou saw something beyond belief as did another poster but you cannot believe your eyes. There are many accounts available where people see things they cannot explain. Are these people hallucinating for some reason?Consider Charles Bonnet SyndromeConsider this list of common causes of hallucinationsDoes your experience exhibit characteristics common in any of the above explanations for hallucination?Some people simply misperceive what they are looking at. ConsiderThe Aperture Capture Illusion  An aligned rod seems misalignedVisual IllusiansDoes your experience exhibit characteristics common in any of the above examples of misperception?If you are not hallucinating of not misperceiving your visual input what else remains?Here we go off the rails of the every day and consider an alternate explanation.You saw something but the reality of the event was different from what you saw. ConsiderHere is an example of augmented reality Symbol triggers cause an app within a smartphone to overlay an image on top of an object. This technique requires the trigger and a smartphone running the app.An operator using advanced technology might be able to obfuscate an object by using a surface trigger which causes your brain to substitute an image for the actual image in your field of view.Currently no known technology exists that would make this possible. Extrapolating current technologies and projecting the results of understanding with greater clarity how the brain creates images from vision we can project with some confidence a technology that allows for direct through vision object overlay within the next  years.Who would be using this type of technology currently?It is interesting to wonder if more than one observer had experienced the same visual input would the perception of the event be the same from person to person. Vision is in part constructed from experience. Would another observer perhaps less familiar with tractors have interpreted the image another way? In your case we will never know.Accounts do exist where observers were not able to agree upon what they were seeing.  The Fatima accounts are an example.Screen memories indicate it might be possible to trigger a visual response in an observer where the actual event is hidden by a substitute image. This mechanism is well understood as it is encountered regularly in individuals coping with past traumatic events sexual abuse violence etc..A deep understanding of human vision and the technological ability to manipulate vision to trigger responses might be within the technological realm of an advanced intelligence which had been observing humanity.Why they would chose to remain hidden why your particular observation required an overlay why you seem to have a deep seated attraction to tractors bordering on sexual obsession just kidding are all questions which we cannot answer. Something happened. Good old boys trying to kill themselves in a ginned up flying machine? A child experiencing his first psychotic break? Aliens hiding in plain sight?Its a mystery.

1325073,0,t3_29939e,It is not just Navajos but many Native American tribes have a belief involving witches trying to achieve the ultimate form of shapeshifting.Some say that in order to be a skinwalker you have to lose all sense of humanity by killing your family. Only then can you achieve it. Some tribes think that there are good ones and evil ones.A skinwalker in human form has eyes that reflect light.A lot of of stories indicate that they like to stalk their prey they walk on hind legs like a human and can run insanely fast but also seem quite interested in observing human behavior for reasons unknown. They are apparently notorious for slipping into large groups of people unknowingly and only get found out if someone does a headcount and notices an extra person. They also seem obsessed with getting in if you are in a cabin or tent or something. As a myth and legend it is quite terrifying but what makes this truly terrifying is the AMOUNT of people with skinwalker encounters and many many people have no idea what a skinwalker is. They will describe one perfectly without any background information on the subject. ,Thetruthishere,ciiormr,12,t5_2sntx

2256521,0,t3_2l1kw4,I have a king sized bed with a huge blood stain on it. My neighbor gave it to me when he lost his lease he had gotten it reconditioned and extraordinarily cheap because of the stain they couldnt get out now black rather than rust because of all the cleaning. No mention of death and apparently it didnt occur to him to ask maybe not wanting to risk his bargain.One afternoon I was sitting on it sorting a drawer out when it started vibrating exactly like one of those old time motel beds you put a quarter in to get a massage. I checked everything out that might be causing it and finally accepted the bed was doing it all by itself. So I just laid down and took the time to enjoy a rich paranormal phenomenon going on in my life along with a free motelbed massage.

And theyve all said Im mentally clear as far as hearing voices as a result of a disorder or dysfunction. B The voices have never been demanding negative dangerous or selfhating which is some of the more common voicesinthehead as far as Ive been told. Theyve never encouraged me to commit suicide or said anything particularly paranoid. Theyve never said negative remarks about myself. C Ive gotten information that I honestly have no way of knowing.

5577294,0,t3_3ra81t,Living in Indian Springs NV across from the base. One story older house.One night my husband heard a noise outside got a flashlight and shone it out an open window. He called his oldest son over to the window too. They saw what my husband who is a scientist btw working on the installation there at the time described as a dark amp wrinkly skinned humanoidlike creature about . to ft tall with rough patches of hair on its body and face.He quickly retreated from the window to wake me up. At this same time the creature jumped up onto the roof. As he was shaking me awake all I saw was my husbands white face and then heard two thumps on the roof. Then heard something hit the ground behind me  outside the windows that were facing the back yard.My husband grabbed the flashlight again and he and his son went to the back door to look out. The creature was now lurking by some bushes in the back yard. After a few minutes of watching it it skittered away outside of flashlight range.They were both white as ghosts and their voices were shaking as they described this creature.My husbands son was friends with the son of the IS police chief. He told his friend what they had seen and the friend related it to his father. His father the police chief came over shortly afterward off the record and told us that he had gotten calls from tourists and people passing through who had also described encounters with this creature.He was highly intrigued himself. He said he had seen fuzzy pictures of it. He related that these sightings were years apart and that the people who called in to report it didnt know one another.Your story reminds me of this. We are miles away from the Springs now but every time I have mentioned that night to my husband he still gets white as a sheet.,Thetruthishere,cwoeyt4,3,t5_2sntx
5673998,0,t3_3sst0s,This reminds me of my dog Milo. Sort of. We had gotten him from the daughter of a family friend when I was in th grade. He was mine immediately. We loved each other so so much. Years passed I moved in and out of my parents home several times but I was still the favorite. I will never ever forget the last time I saw him alive. I had been visiting from school and I was about to leave. I hugged him and kissed him and told him I loved him. He gave me a few of his hugs which was really him just nuzzling his face onto your legs. My front yard has a gate because we live by a busy street my parents put it up when I learned to walk actually. I opened the gate to leave and he made the most heart breaking cry I had ever heard him make. Never in all the years that we had him had he ever reacted to me leaving that way. I turned to look at him and he just stared at me with his big brown eyes. I teared up then he knew I knew this was it. This would be the last time we would see each other. I turned around and hugged him again I was barely holding it together. He gave me a kiss which he was always so reserved about. I looked at my dad with tears in my eyes and he just said I know hun. My poor baby was  and so rickety. He fell every time I came home because his legs didnt work like they used to and he was always so excited to see me. As I went to walk out of the gate he with all the might he had left pushed passed me and ran to my car. Honest to God even thinking about this Im tearing up. My dad and my dog watched me leave from the driveway and I cried for almost an hour as I drove back to school.  A few weeks later my parents had to put him down. This was   years ago and I still miss that guy so much. He might as well had been my brother we grew up together. Thank you for sharing your story. While I am so sad for you I am also happy your little kitty gave you that gift. She knew and she loved you and youll never forget the gift she gave you for as long as you live. ,Thetruthishere,cx0eyy5,14,t5_2sntx

I mean could local teenagers or other people homeless people drug users spiritualistsoccultists travellersgypsies etc. be using the field for something at night? The two low lights in the middle look a little like headlights with a metallic reflection underneath. The quality of the light itself makes it look somewhat artificial like bright white halogen lamps.I guess that in the end the only way to really figure this out would be to actually go there the next time you see it.

Undeniably the worst part was my girlfriends reaction. The screaming is something I will never forget.Im leaning towards our brains creating a perceived threat as a survival mechanism to prepare us for potential threats.So despite there being no actual threat our brains were attempting to fill in the gaps in preparation for the fight or flight response. Im heavily leaning towards their being someone just outside our window leaving for work causing the pup to bark. Then my reaction spurred my girlfriends reaction which in turned heightened my fear response and so on and so forth. ,Thetruthishere,d5ukiu6,2,t5_2sntx

8517902,0,t3_4we51g,I LITERALLY just typed up something to submit here for the first time Ive never been here before but Ive spent today trying to find answers to something that happened last year that remains one of the most horrific experiences of my life. Im going to delete that post and just post it here. Ill preface by saying I did not SEE anything. And that what is haunting me so much about this. Ive tried goggling creatures in my area but nothing seems to stand out to me and Im hoping maybe someone can shed some answers here. We have a family cabin near Sandpoint ID. I have been spending summers there with my husband for nearly  years now. We go up there almost every weekend sometimes staying weeks at a time. Being in the woods and near the lake Im not a stranger to animals. I also grew up in rural midwest in the woods so Im comfortable and not easily spooked by the woods at night. Last year we went up for our usual weekend visit. I remember getting to the cabin and finding out my husband forgot and left my hiking boots on the porch of our home and I was really pissed off since I had planned to spend the weekend hiking. All I had to wear the entire weekend was a pair of cheap sandals. That night we got the kids tucked into bed and we folded out the sofasleeper where we sleep. My husband fell asleep but I had a new book I was reading and decided to stay up and read it. It was around  in the morning when I heard what can only be described as screams. I jumped out of bed and ran to the door and peaking my head out could tell the sound was just beyond our cabin. It was a new moon and I couldnt see anything but it was at most  feet from our cabin just beyond the chainlink fence that divides our property from another. It was the sound of animal being attacked. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I held my breath. It was a coyote and it was being straight up killed. There was no struggle and thats what stood out to me. No rustling of grass of trees or leaves. No growling or snapping. Only the sounds of a coyote screaming and dying. it went on for enough that I thought is it struck in a trap? and I was debating on walking to the fence to see if I could help but all I had was my stupid sandals to wear.. no way was I stumbling around in the dark in the woods in sandals. Slowly it finally died. and everything was quiet. I felt sick to my stomach because Ive never heard an animal suffer and scream like that.and then I heard it. Something was on my property something jumped our fence with out a sound and was slowly walking along the property line. It was completely silent but its foot steps and they were clearly bipedal. it was like the most graceful  human was walking and I couldnt see a damn thing because it was pitch dark.  Theres no way a human could walk the woods of our property with no moon out and no flash light and NOT fall or trip over stumps and brush. It didnt move fast and seemed to stop for a moment maybe spotting me on the porch? and then quietly walk off. If you grow up in the woods you KNOW the sound of animal vs human walking in the woods.  feet vs  makes a big difference.I was trying so hard to convince myself maybe it was the coyote maybe it got away maybe it was stuck in a trap. I asked the neighbors about traps and they were  against them said they knew our family was in the dog business and would NEVER put traps out since we often have our dogs with us. I dont know what killed the coyote. ,Thetruthishere,d66aql2,89,t5_2sntx

8641095,0,t1_d6lgc2m,gt Where do vampires originate from? How long have they existed?The precise origin is unknown both there are various origin stories. Some believe they descend from Judas Iscariot. Others say Cain and some say theyre sired by Lilith. Then you have stories they descend from the moon goddess Selene. For more information on vampire deities follow this link. Its difficult to determine the specifics of where they originate. As for how long from what I currently gathered at least prior to the birth of Christ. Theres even theories that vampires existed during the times of the pharaohs in Egypt well before the birth of Christ. Does this mean there are vampires walking around thousands of years old? Possibly but I personally doubt it. What I do believe in is that the progeny of vampires from those times walk among us today.gt Do moviesbookscultural legends get much right? Do you think any media is purposefully created by people who know about vampires directly either for disinformation or to secretly reveal things to people in the know?  I believe Anne Rices books and White Wolfs Vampire The Masquerade series are the most accurate fictitious depictions of my specific type of vampire. Most vampire authors only depict vampires as pure sex objects or viscous monsters. Few attempt to depict vampires as having not only their own societies but their own politics. The aforementioned examples get a few things right. For example the process of making a vampire which involves draining a human of their blood and replacing it with vampire blood. I definitely believe some information they use as deliberate lies so vampires can prove theyre still human to upkeep their disguise. For example these types of vampires would still have heartbeats contrary to popular opinion. Why? They still need blood and a heartbeat is needed to circulate the blood. So vampires can show you a pulse and prove theyre still human. As for the truth put out there in the media thats difficult to say. My best guess? Vampires dont personally author such info in the media but pass on information to some that do. I personally believe Anne Rice directly or indirectly had contact with either a vampire or someone that met them. Anne Rice lived in New Orleans which is rumored to house many older vampires even to this day.gt Is it possible or favorable to become a vampire? Do they allow in outsiders? Out of curiosity not interest. I would not like to be a vampire. Yes from what I understand about the process which is essentially like a blood transfusion nearly anyone can become a vampire. Is it favorable? Thats a whole other comment since Ill reach the character limit soon lol. Ive cover that separately. gt Are vampires truly immortal? Is there any truth to the infamous methods to kill vampires? From what I understand its the blood thats the source of their superhuman abilities as well as immortality. They wont die from old age but they can still be killed like the rest of us. I only know three surefire methods decapitation massive blood loss or heart removal. If they suffer one of those things they can no longer utilize their blood which keeps them alive. gt Are there vampires in positions of power? Or fame? Power? Likely financial power. Id find it harder to believe that literally no vampire achieved such wealth. If theyre smart theyre never public figures but instead operate behind the scenes. For example every political leader needs financial support. That financial supporters face you almost never see in the media but without him that leaders effectiveness drops instantly. There are rumors that some vampires have become celebrities throughout time. But they either eventually quit because youll soon realize they never age or theyre killed. gt Are there any things hidden in plain sight that serve to benefit this subculture? E.G. is the Red Cross blood drive a front to get blood for vampires without having to turn new initiates into vampires? That sort of thing. Its said that vampires must feed on a living breathing human. The blood must be fresh or it loses its value for some reason. My theory is theres some undiscovered element inside the blood that they crave which becomes absent once the bloods removed and stored. Thats why I dont hear of many blood bank robberies. One thing Im certain benefits them is the Goth and vampire lifestyle cultures. To quote the movie Interview With the Vampire Theyre vampires pretending to be humans that are pretending to be vampires. Its a very useful disguise and gives some vampires a chance to express their true selves among humans even if fictionally. Its likely patrons at Goth clubs have met an actual vampire but thought heshe was only pretending.

9415054,0,t1_d99enno,All metaphysical related books by Robert Bruce. These are more modern titles but I feel they explain a lot of the stuff Ive learned on my own that wasnt fully explained in the older occult books. Robert really sort of explains energy work in a way  year olds can understand. Which compared to a lot of older books their language can almost be cryptic and over complicated.Initiation into Hermetics By Franz BardonHe also has a title on Evocation. This is like a foundation type book. Probably every serious practicing occultist has read this book two or more times. Franz Bardon is a great teacher and writer. He really makes an effort to explain things thoroughly and has a rather interesting history. Franz Bardon was such a skilled occultistmagi at the time that the Nazi army Hitler himself wanted him on their side to win the war using his occult abilities.So he held Bardon captive as a prisoner. But Franz refused and eventually he was tortured to death over a number of years. But in that time he released as much information as he could via written documents that he released to his few students.I also recommend occultmetaphysical books by Damon Brand.Note that I recommend a lot of modern books over the old stuff. Reason I do this is because a lot of the modern writers have actually read the old stuff taken out what works and made it better. Damon Brand is using a lot of methods from the classic book New Avatar Power his stuff really works. But I feel that Damon Brand probably takes it to the next level. Some of these modern occultists are really writing some groundbreaking material and definitely need more credit for it.I also recommend Jason Millers titles on modern sorcery.,Thetruthishere,d99f9jt,2,t5_2sntx

9455271,0,t3_59x03d,Radio ! PUH! Im Canadian and have no idea what you are talking aboutInteresting story. For most of my life much like you I have endeavoured to be as rational and scientific as possible and thus have been sceptical about the supernatural. Then a few years ago Im thirtyone now I came to realization that I cannot intellectually claim any certitude about whether or not supernatural entities exist but emotionally I believe. It was a hard thing to come to terms with actually. I think I had a bit of cognative dissonance.For example when this one incident happened even though I couldnt explain it I actively ingnored it as a threat to my paradigm. The story I walked downstairs and saw my deceased Grandfathers old rocking chair rocking back and forth. Now this thing is really heavy. I mean it is like a rocking chair built for industrial purposes. Thick heavy wood. And it is rocking back and forth at full swing. There was no one else in the basement so I thought that perhaps my cat had been sleeping on it jumped off and was hiding somewhere. After all she did sleep there on occasion.  A few months later I saw my cat jump off the thing. She was on the very edge of the seat which I imagine would create the most leverage for rocking. It did not budge an inch.

9596916,0,t3_5ccae6,Kinda reminds me of a story I told earlier this year in an ask reddit threadgtSo I had a football coach back in high school who was also one of my teachers for a semester. He told us one story that freaked us all out pretty bad. He had a coaching job at a small college in Montana when he was a lot younger and newly married. He said that after practice one evening he was making his long commute home and the route ran alongside just fields and fields of hay grain whatever. Since it was late summerearly fall it wasnt even approaching dark yet. His car was an old beat up truck with just a bench seat. Anyway hes driving along when he sees a hitchhiker on the shoulder. This being back in the day and in smalltown Montana my teacher pulled over to let the guy in without a second thought. The man was described as wearing a really old outdated style of suit. Not quite a zoot suit but styled in a similar baggy way. He also had a big stylish hat. This guy looked like he was out of the s and sort of like a pimp. My teacher thought it was weird that he was so overdressed it being super hot out. But maybe that was the only clothing he had.So the guy gets in next to my teacher without a word. Teacher asks him where he needs to go and the guy just points forward. Teacher drives on.Later my teacher tried talking to the guy just trying to make simple conversation but the guy wouldnt speak or even acknowledge him. He just pulled his hat down like he was sleeping. Out of nowhere the guy just tips up his hat looks out the window and says Stop the car Now. My teacher pulls over and lets him out not wanting to offend a possibly crazy man. The guy stands on the side of the road for a second and then at a dead sprint just runs off into the field beside the road until my teacher couldnt see him anymore granted the crop was fairly tall. He waits there for a while thinking maybe the guy had the runs or something and didnt want to shit next to the road. After a long enough wait my teacher gets back in the truck and starts to accelerate back on to the road.The thing about really old trucks is that they dont accelerate very fast. As my teacher got back on to the road he looked in his rearview mirror to check for a safe merge. But there wasnt a car in sight. What there was was the hitchhiker on all fours like an animal running crawling? after the truck at an inhuman speed. Meanwhile my teacher is beginning to fishtail as he attempts to go faster. The whole time his eyes glued on the mirror watching the man chase after his car. Eventually he was able to get up to speed and lost sight of the guy in his mirror. When he was able to stop at a gas station to use a pay phone he called his wife at home to tell her the story and to lock up the house. She thinks hes just messing with her and he had been talking to her coworker about the hitchhiker. When he asks why she would think that apparently at her office in the town she worked in one of her coworkers told her a story of the exact same thing happening to them. And it is a wellknown urban legend in that town. She thought it was just folks playing with the new girl at work who had to drive home alone at night. Anyways my teacher assured her that he was not lying and she evidently believes him and can vouch for her side of the story because she showed up to one of our fundraisers and I asked her about it. So yeah now I just avoid lonely roads in Montana. A lot of you are asking where this happened. I dont think he ever actually told us. But for some reason Im leaning towards the northwestern part of Montana. At least thats where I pictured it in my mind. Sorry I cant be of further help. He told us this story quite a long time ago.,Thetruthishere,d9w0l46,8,t5_2sntx

9722079,0,t3_5e9dec,Im on my way into work now but heres one. Apparently the th floor used to have guest rooms in the early s. Theres approximately  rooms to a floor including a few suites. As the story goes a guy came to the hotel and crashed a party in a suite his lover in attendance and suspected of an affair. He started shooting into the room killing a few people before killing himself. I tried looking into this but didnt find anything. Im sure.the story has been warped through the years as its told from employees. Since then the th floor has been remodeled into a meeting room floor. You could host several different events or meetings at once. In the north west corner of the building there is a wing of meeting rooms known for activity. The employees who set up the tables chairs glassware snacks water and.coffee and other stuff always report their items are.moved around after they set them up. A guy told me he set up all the water glasses for a meeting and as he was walking out of the room heard glass break behind him. When he looked the glasses on the table that he has just set had all beencrushed in place. He was convinced an unseen force was trying to flatten them. The security cameras record based on motion. We have had techs come out to service and ask why the th floor is constantly recording if theres nothing up there moving around. No one really knows. Its not hardware or software settings. Reports of doors slamming and chairs being found in different places are filed here and there. Its super creepy walking that floor at night. You always feel like you are being watched. On overnights not a soul will go up there unless they have to and they use the buddy system when they do. ,Thetruthishere,dabgieb,8,t5_2sntx

Perhaps contact the author uthelitteredfox,Thetruthishere,ddjn293,8,t5_2sntx

10812340,0,t1_ddv79fd,Absolutely. One of the most frustrating things about running a paranormal focused sub on Reddit is the army of big A big S Atheist Skeptics running around wielding Occams Razor like a sword thinking it makes them giants of intellectualism.  People like Randi are just as dogmatic and close minded as any religious leader. When you believe you have all the answers you stop asking questions and youll never learn the truth. ,Thetruthishere,ddv7t2h,23,t5_2sntx

10995217,0,t3_5wppg8,Ive had two experiences on large doses of LSD where I felt a very strong telepathic communication from what claimed to be an alien entity. Both times were terrifying and exciting and unlike any other experience on hallucinogens Ive had. I feel pretty open to the possibilities here  it could have been a genuine outside force contacting me or I couldve made it all up in my state. Powerful either way. This happened in an area where many people including some trusted friends have seen UFOs. I have not yet.,Thetruthishere,dee9uwt,1,t5_2sntx

11241264,0,t1_df628e3,Again Im not saying I believe the earth is flat... Im just simply stating that you cant assume every single person that believes in a flat earth is mentally ill. And there are certainly people that dont believe in those other things youve mentioned as well. Regardless Im not going to assume theyre retarded because they dont understand the science and mathematics involved in proving its round.And youre right I believe the earth is round and Ive never gotten on a boat and done the math myself. I believe that its round based on faith that people much smarter than I am correctly did the math already and the photos we have from space arent fake.But not everybody likes that blind faith of science and the possibility of a giant coverup although it seems so unlikely is possible. Though I dont know what the purpose would be? I wouldnt label people retarded for putting their faith in the wrong people Id just call them misinformed and we should be helping show them whats true not shaming them... ,Thetruthishere,df66isa,9,t5_2sntx
11283355,0,t3_5yftod,I know Im a bit late coming on here but I really urge you to get in touch with a catholic priest and arrange for him to bless the house.  Theres no exorcism needed  only people are exorcised not houses.  It just sounds as if there is something there that needs to leaveand it doesnt seem like it wants to.I would respectfully caution against trying to contact the entity yourself or getting in touch with a medium.  It sounds like it got worse after you guys spoke to it.  I know that not everybody is religious and thats cool  but just as far as I believe if you engage with something like that yore kind of opening a door for it and giving it more power  In my opinion its best to leave it to a priest.  They will definitely know what they are doing.Best of luck!,Thetruthishere,dfay9j2,1,t5_2sntx

11493408,0,t1_dfyiu18,And waste my time trying to convince someone who most likely doesnt want to be convinced? Nah Im good. Quite frankly I dont give a flying fuck whether or not you believe in paranormal things thats not what bothered me what bothered me is youre blatant arrogance just flat out saying paranormal things dont exist when you have probably done virtually no real research and youre basing your statement off the fact that youve never experienced anything paranormal. You see some people havent had such a dry life concerning the paranormal. So for someone to say a statement such as those things are rubbish just makes me laugh... a chuckle with a hint of irritation. Because if someone said that to my face I would then laugh in their face... because Ive experienced undeniable things. And when someone insinuates that those things dont exist is quite offensive. Not that I was personally offended by your post I was just saying that as an example. Im ranting at this point. Do what you want think what you want. Its whatever. I was just speaking my mind thats all. Hopefully something comes your way to fully convince you because its quite exciting but Im not going to be the one to do that. Basically to sum up everything Ive just said in a nut shell Ive had multiple multiple multiple experiences. SOME could be brought with skepticism even by me.. but there were those experiences that are undeniable to me and others that shared the experience with me. Have a splendid day.If you wanted to not beat around the bush with research.. and if you had enough free time you could buy a book with all the weird shit in your state and go there and test it for yourself. My dad gave me a book called Weird Texas. Maybe they have a book in your state call Weird .Not to mention there are houses that are literally deemed haunted by the state... sooo.... explain that one.,Thetruthishere,dfyrz4d,1,t5_2sntx

They watched a shadow walk across a furnace front but there was no one there to create the shadow. ,Thetruthishere,dga5od7,22,t5_2sntx
