2299108,0,t3_2lg8ue,From the companys standpoint they are taking the safest stance for themselves. Theres no proof within the game that something underhanded was done. What they see on their end is that one player traded with another player. The types of cards dont matter as someone helping someone else perhaps a younger player would likely do that. You simply cannot determine the legitimacy of a trade based on trade values.So all they have to go on is the word of the player. As demonstrated by the hack players are known to do underhanded things to get ahead in games. A player could certainly lie about being hacked after a trade in order to screw over another player or simply take back a trade. Helping your friend would make a precedent for simply taking players at their word and changing things all the time. No one wants to play a game in which that happens. That damages the reputation of the game and makes Konami look foolish as a company.Im sorry your friend has gone through this and has lost money on the game. But I wouldnt describe the customer service as disgusting or awful. It just wasnt helpful for what you wanted. And that sucks.,konami,clvvwnb,2,t5_2vjij
