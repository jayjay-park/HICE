Things were pretty bad a few days ago managed to convince myself every other human being was being possessed by demons and had a breakdown called the gf multiple times at AM and left some batshit messages about how I know the truth about who she is... Yeah. Fun times. but Im feeling much better now. Went on a long walk in the woods. Still unable to draw a thing though which is a shame but other than that things are good.

1193831,0,t3_27okez,A long distance relationship is definitely hard but not impossible. I understand how you may be feeling about not being able to talk to him as communication is important especially when you live far apart. But sometimes we might face situations where communication is important. This is the point where the importance of trust becomes more prominent. Be realistic and ask yourself how much you trust him. If you believe that you do love each other and he is trustworthy it will be easier for you to spend that gap of less communication. Keep yourself distracted and use this time to focus on the activities you might have been avoiding or couldnt take out the time for before. You were strong enough to decide to be in an LDR and Im sure you can be strong enough to be able to pass these days of not being able to contact him. Take care ,TheMixedNuts,ci3xasx,1,t5_318vk

1629822,0,t3_2czklh,Thats so awesome! Its so important to find someone you feel comfortable with and someone who actually seems to care. After all whats the point if you cant open up or arent being helped?My suggestion is to take note of what this new therapist does exactly that really helps you. If youre ever forced to switch therapists you should mention what worked for you and what didnt. Hopefully the new therapist could follow a similar pattern but if not maybe she could recommend someone who could. Hope you get to stay with this one for a long time!  ,TheMixedNuts,cjklr4t,3,t5_318vk

1969755,0,t3_2h7xjs,So when I first started feeling like this I thought it was normal. Then I thought maybe it was depression. Then I got sick and thought that explained everything. Now Im doing better physically but not mentally. So I guess Im back to the depression hypothesis. It really doesnt feel like my usual depressions so its been easy to just beat myself up for being a lazy shit. But there have been more and more suicidal thoughts so I guess I should probably talk to someone about that. My pdoc gets back tomorrow I have bipolar group tomorrow night and I see my therapist on Friday. So Im covered. The thing is... I mean my situation is really shitty and I think it would depress and overwhelm anyone. So where do you draw the line? Where do you medicate more and where do you just get through it? I dont want to up my antidepressant because Im already having trouble sleeping and the jaw clenching is pretty bad. I also dont want to up my mood stabilizer because it fucks with my memory and I cant afford that if Im trying to get a new job. So much for the miracle cocktail. Ugh. Im going to spend some time looking into the career center today and Ill probably look through job postings as well. If only to get my dad to back the fuck off. I dont need a daily reminder that I need to figure out how to support myself before December. Also if my body could stop being in excruciating pain that would be great. ,TheMixedNuts,ckqk1ap,1,t5_318vk
2013388,0,t3_2hs179,Im so exhausted today.  I went to bed early last night and the night before. Had a headache last night.  Im at work.  Stressed out.  I think my time with my SO is coming to an end.  We had a great time but I really dont think were going where I want to go.  Weve been together almost  years.  Hes never taken me out on a date hell he never even asked me to be his girlfriend.  He lived with me for almost a year before he even called me his girlfriend.  I think hes with me because its convenient for him.  I do everything.  Doesnt work doesnt help pay bills doesnt really help clean doesnt cook Im tired when Im at work all day.  I dont want to come home to a messy house and no food because my SO I too busy browsing reddit and playing halo and watching sports all day long.  And when I get home he doesnt stop what hes doing to hang out with me.  He just keeps doing what hes doing.  I feel like were friends but Im being taken advantage of.  Im tired of being the person who makes us us.  Yeah hes super nice and whatnot but niceness only gets you so far and after almost  years hes falling short.  Were  now.  Not kids anymore.  Its time to be adults.  Time to start doing something in life which I am but hes not.  Time to take care of each other.  Ive been taking care of him for so long whos taking care of me?  Myself and its exhausting.  Were gonna have to separate.  He needs to figure his shit out and he cant do it with me because Im a total enabler.  Id rather be single than be with a deadbeat who doesnt make me feel special or attractive.  I know this sounds bad but Ive got a line of people wanting to be with me people actually willing to make an effort.  Its finally hitting me now that I deserve something more.  I dont know how to bring this up to him.  Or the best time.  A separation means that hell be moving out to who knows where maybe his parents? He has no job I have to buy a new bed new silverwear new pots and pans.  Clean my house etc.  I feel that if we separated Id be able to stop drinking.  Its hard to quit when hes there drinking beer after beer right in front of me.  I need someone who will support me in the things I want to do like exercise and get healthy not someone who just says have fun good luck Im gonna sit here and play video games while youre working your ass off.I just have to get the guts to talk to him.  Its gonna shake up our lives.  But everyone Ive talked to about this close friends and good coworkers are telling me that I need to take care of myself and I need to be happy which Im not.  I need to be with someone who makes me feel special and attractive and loved not with someone who doesnt really give a shit.,TheMixedNuts,ckvt64z,3,t5_318vk

Which they did I didnt show it but I was anxious through the day and still on edge. I really dont get out very much and withdrew from the outside world.

2562330,0,t3_2p2uzd,I dont think what you edited was irrelevant. If you ever wanna chat my inbox is always open. ltAs for me Im a dorkface who stayed up until am. Why you ask? Because I wanted to finish the arm on the sweater and then I wanted to figure out how to fix the neckline and then I wanted to try it on and figure out if I wanted to make modifications to the arms... Yeah. Couldve waited til morning but I was having fun so. Disturbed sleep is pretty high up there as far as bipolar triggers go so it was a really dumb move. I mean I was just thinking last night about how awesome it felt to be stable moodwise even if my cognitive skills are kaput. I guess well see how well this upped dosage holds up wont we?Nothing planned for today at least. Turns out it probably wouldve been a good day to go down to the DMV as it seems the storm has passed but I dont want to do it on little sleep. I should probably study more anyway. Ill be on my computer tomorrow to fill out that damn state disability form so Ill probably study then. I think today will be knitting and video games. As usual. Oh! I was trying to figure out why Dec  had significance to me. Its a week before my birthday but its also the day a year ago that I decided to go out for a couple drinks and ended up getting arrested for DUI. Well arrest was technically on the th but it was like am so. A year ago! Ive been dealing with it for a year. Jeez. The interesting thing is I can still remember that incident like it was yesterday while I dont remember much of the past year. It really doesnt seem like a year has passed since then. But its also interesting to remember my mindset back then what I was going through. I still had so much fire haha. I dont know if its maturity or meds but I feel like Ive mellowed out a bit. Probably meds and a bad memory. Anyway. Mom woke me up with the dog a little bit ago so I guess thats my cue to get up. ,TheMixedNuts,cmt18rs,1,t5_318vk

I tried some easy prenatal yoga yesterday I watched the video first before trying and was like dude I can totally do that and managed to pull a muscle in my chest.  That plus my boobs being ridiculous I am very uncomfortable.  Danger does physical therapy stuff for work so he showed me how to stretch and it helps a lot but that doesnt fix the boobs thing.  I think Ill be wearing sports bras for forever.  I stopped by work this morning and picked up the books Id ordered.  My coworkers were like dont go walking downtown by yourself because its too far and Im like dude its fucking close as hell it takes me  minutes to get downtown and they said just wait til you get there and cant walk back! and I was like haha yeah whatever you weirdos.  Then Danger and I went to Target where I bought a bunch of healthy snacks and some maternity clothes that were on clearance and we didnt wander around the store or anything I knew exactly where everything was and we were inout in about  minutes but it was enough to be exhausting because when we got home I passed out for over an hour.  I guess I wont be taking any walks downtown by myself.   Blahhh.Monday is my last day of Wellbutrin.  I really like Wellbutrin.I totally dig maternity tops because theyre long as fuck.  Before I knew I was pregnant I was looking for tunic tops because I really like long tops.I keep having all of these weird dreams involving people I havent seen in years and I always wake up craving something.

8348416,0,t3_4tt5nm,You just sound overwhelmed and anxious not psychotic. And to be honest your improper usage upsets me. Psychosis is misunderstood greatly and something like this only furthered the misunderstanding.  ,TheMixedNuts,d5l3s6q,3,t5_318vk
8348562,0,t1_d5l3s6q,As someone who also suffers from psychosis I agree. It is misunderstood. Psychosis is a break from reality which can be from delusion hallucination or something like that. When I have a psychotic break I think people are after me or I see dogs or Im unable to speak. I forget daily routines and cant function.It sounds like youre having a break down but maybe not a psychotic break? That would accompany something like schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar I.,TheMixedNuts,d5l4ftg,2,t5_318vk
8511415,0,t1_d65h2us,Its not happiness all of the time but it shouldnt be so...volatile?  I dont think.  If there arent events that are causing your mood like if everything around you is doing somewhat decently well people without mood disorders would be ok not low.  You know what I mean?  Im also counting the weird psychotic experience and the fact that you dont know how youre going to do school as reasons to go see someone.  Because I didnt know how I was going to go back to work after having my son and it turns out I had post partum depression once they got me back on meds I was like oh I think I can do this!  And it turned out ok.Edit sorry Im not trying to be bossy or anything I just want you to feel better more consistently lt,TheMixedNuts,d65hfb7,1,t5_318vk

8901742,0,t1_d7htqjb,First of all welcome. The people here are all nice and you should feel free to post in daily check in threads or make a new thread of the next days isnt up yet. I dont have a lot to say because my day was exhausting but PTSD can be very exhausting when triggers pop up. Ive been talking to my therapist about working through mine lately. Its really a challenge. It can also be tricky to find bearings again. Hopefully things will settle in some for you.,TheMixedNuts,d7hv0z8,3,t5_318vk

11414682,0,t3_62s1fa,Today was fine.  I got to sleep in for once which was glorious.  Its probably going to screw me for tomorrow though.  Sundays I have to get up before  but Saturday I sleep in till like  in the afternoon.  Kinda hard to go to bed at midnight when youve only been up since .  Work was slow and my tips were shit compared to my sales because I had a bunch of to go orders that didnt tip.I have  vultures the kitties staring at me while I eat my dinner because I usually feed them before myself but I was so hungry I felt lightheaded and nauseous.  I had Quorn chicken nuggets and a sweet potato for dinner.  It was the last sweet potato and C was wanting it but that just sounded good.  Ive got to cook off some pork chops for C because hes working tonight and theyre about to expire.  Today is the  year anniversary of me becoming a vegetarian.  Im thankful C was as cool about it as he was.  One day I said I dont think I can eat meat anymore and the next day I quit eating meat completely.  Ive accidentally eaten meat a couple times since but I try the best I can.  The only exception I make is my vitamin D pills that my doctor has me taking.  I literally couldnt even find them at Whole Foods that didnt have gelatin.  I like to think Im making a difference anyway.  I wish I could be vegan but that would destroy my diet because I rely so heavily on dairy and eggs.  I would be miserable and probably hungry all the time and perpetually crabby.  My stupid period is late.  Ive had my tubes tied so its very unlikely Im pregnant.  I have PCOS so it could come anywhere from  days early to a couple weeks late.  Itd be nice if it were predictable though.,TheMixedNuts,dfpucv6,1,t5_318vk
