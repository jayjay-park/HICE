5555251,0,t3_3r7ycx,Lullwater park at Emory is a good place to start. There are some hilly bits which is good practice for general biking around ATL. Also biking around Emory campus is good most areas in the central campus dont allow cars and its pretty empty on the weekends for practice. ,BikeATL,cwlohd3,4,t5_301zv
6244077,0,t1_cyyj42f,This is definitely my approach although Im trying to balance needing a decent public school say around a  on the great schools scale wanting a single family home with a bit of a yard and wanting a diverse neighborhood that is also walkable along with that. Sadly I think my commute time is the thing thats going to push because well...  Thats part of the reason were considering relocating we own here. But my commute is just far enough that Im not enjoying it anymore and we can afford to buy any closer.Can I ask how walkable is piedmont park area really? like are there sidewalks? I LOVE sidewalks ,BikeATL,cyzdtnj,1,t5_301zv
8110014,0,t3_4q5hlg,Do I have any right bike on the sidewalk for some reason usually because the road feels unsafe? Or am I only allowed to walk it?Frequently when I bike home late at night I dont want to risk the drunk drivers on the road. Of course biking on the sidewalk has plenty of risks on its own. But Id still rather slow down and go around pedestrians and trees sometimes.,BikeATL,d4rmzzi,3,t5_301zv
