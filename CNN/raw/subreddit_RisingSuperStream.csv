10323378,0,t3_5nlyya,I cannot say how happy I am to see Liam doing this.  I was honestly worried I wouldnt get to see him play all those oddball Japanese games that I always looked forward to see on the SBFP and now I get to watch him play them live and on his own channel!!  Now we just need to get him to do his own podcast all about anime and shit and Ill be in seventh heaven!!!,RisingSuperStream,dce7mtf,1,t5_3ig6d
