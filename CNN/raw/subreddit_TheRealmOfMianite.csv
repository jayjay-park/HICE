You might not like some changes that have been made to the story. You might not like the addition of the Wizards and the Pirates and Ianite. You might think that there is a tonne of wasted potential here in this series. But you know what all these things have in common ? YOU.Mianite started as a series where some friends could get on a server stream some Minecraft and have fun and guess what? It still is. Sure they may argue and sure a lot of things might have changed there might be a specifically driven plot but its still just some friends having fun and doing what they love playing video games and entertaining people. What youre trying to do is turn this series into a goddamn business venture youre trying to make it a job for them. And the moment something becomes a job you stop having fun with it it turns into a chore some money making necessity instead of what it should be  fun.I could rant on for ages about how wrong this post is but to be honest I just find it damn rude that you think youve got the fucking right to say anything like this.

3327948,0,t3_2y9oz7,Although his decisions might not be wrong to some people it was definitely wrong in my eyes. Pretty sure we all can agree that he was corrupted by greed and Martha was trying to warn him of this. He just brushed her off of being salty when shes really trying to help. This is the reason I stopped watching Tom. Hes literally turning into Tom .. His bad side is really showing. I hope he gets at least a little punished somehow.Of course hell still be an Ianitee. Hes always been and hell always be. But Jordan does need to realize that gaining the trust of the Lieutenant is not his job nor is it the right choice. Thats the job of Tucker and especially Sonja. He needs to know that he needs to help lead the rebellion since Ianite is the major role here. He needs to set the example and not be easily tempted by greed.My question Was the rapier really worth destroying the symbolism of Ianite returning to her beloved town? The Taint represented the corruption the King brought. The taint was supposed to be punishment of the town for disowning her most importantly punishing Helgrind. But of course Helgrind missed the worst of it. When Jordan gets rid of the taint Helgrind sees it as Mianite always finding a way of protecting the Town. Jordan needs to see that the town needs to fall into shambles so the King will stop his retchedness and be overthrown by the revolution. The revolution fights alongside the taint and destroying it is lowering your attack damage. Its the emotional balance that needs to be restored not the physical balance. The king obviously disowned his mother because of EMOTIONS. His wife and daughter died. Where does that hurt the most? EMOTIONS. And the emotions are what really needs to be fixed. Jordan doesnt seem to get that.I cant wait until the others from Pax get back so all the people from Tom stop ruining Jordans decisions. I can bet you over  of the people voting for him to Take the rapier and Blow it all up were from tom. I bet you all the money I have. Theres no doubt the stupid Dianitees influenced him to do this.Im Team Martha here. Martha knows whats up. Shes trying to warn and Jordan isnt listening.

I was stating that I prefer story because it prevents peoples houses from being burned down though I may have needed to specify ingame. Also his past discussions about the story shows that he has a very negative outlook on the story.I was trying to say that the story has kept the streamers from becoming bored as most elements favored today such as the purge came from the story as a way of preventing boredom from causing the streamers to go rouge and start wars or in some extreme cases burn another players house down.I started off somewhat negatively in the comment as I am curious to know why he does not like the story. If we were to be logical Mianite Season  would likely not exist if it werent for story. If it would of lasted this long without it it would have simply stayed the same. Vanilla can only go so far without something tangible to hold it and by the end of Season  people were begging for modded mianite.

When Dianite comes to power in this scenario Ianite would then have to compensate for the lack of evil to maintain balance bringing us back to this same problem of her wasting her power. Again if Im understanding correctly might be an issue.  ,TheRealmOfMianite,cquehlr,1,t5_32pei

3981832,0,t1_cra5okk,gt He has the choice to kill somebody or not. But it is very important to give them that choice. Story and Mianite as a whole shouldnt be what we plan it to be. The streamers need to make choices for themselves. So the ability to kill people is one choice.I understand. Thank you.So shouldnt the others also be given the same choice? Why only give one person the choice to kill someone and break through the tough armor but no one else? Shouldnt the others also be given a chance to defend themselves or kill the person with the powerful weapon?Editgt I would agree about setting people back but with us around nothing is lost forever. We will just make it a fun way to get it back rather than the boring grind of mods.Do the streamers know though that they dont need to be as protective of their items and they dont need to worry about it? Do they know that they can go after each other without too much worry? Do they know that someone can blow up their ME system and you guys will replace all the items for them so they can be free to go after each other?,TheRealmOfMianite,cra5wby,1,t5_32pei

4410042,0,t1_csmmam9,What I meant is that because you have used mod you couldnt use command blocks at their fullest because until . fixes the compatibility only few mods are after . and because usings plugins command blocks are pretty much always broken.In season one the special things were Ianite sugar that never worked and Toms sword that simply gave particles these things were really nothing against what some simple give command could have done in fact towards the end of the season Tucker received a sword with Looting IV that was pretty much the best thing anyone had. Little things like custom enchantments or attributes would have made really cool gear but this never happened.Now in season two you used mods and plugins to create puzzles but some of them was cheated realy easily or couldnt work really good. If instead of focusing on plugins and mods you used instead command blocks you could have easily created interesting puzzles with vanilla items making possible to control more what the players could have done.What I hope is that you will use them because are built ingame so things done with them are more solid and the fact that are made in vanilla can amaze more the viewers.This is anyway my point of view because I work poorly with command blocks myself and I know what they can do but you know better what can work for the series.After all the best possible things would be anyway plugins written on purpose for Mianite Im not telling that command blocks are the best thing ever ,TheRealmOfMianite,csmqvvm,2,t5_32pei

4999754,0,t3_3ifpv1,I think the main story in season  was actually pretty good not saying season  was bad but there was more exposition better writing style you could tell it was more professional whatever happened behind the scenes is their business bad com and what not. Did it take up too much of the season Yes. The pvp was so badly done this season against first season the only time I really had the feeling they had fun was the final purge. And I also think the timing when season  started and when it ended had something to do with it. Just after E seemed all a bit rushed really. The modded minecraft was fine really. It is actually way better than vanilla really. Vanilla minecraft is so bland. It is good that they each went for a different kind of modpack to test things out. They just should have done more with it I feel showing it off is fine but integrated it more in the shenanigans. I mean sure the lighthouse being transported fine death fields fine. It takes time but work around it. Let people behind the scenes help with it. Seems like more fun. The wizards were they supposed to be a part of it all? They never really did anything. The heart exposition? What was it for? I think if you bring back the wizards in it all and the pvp from season one combined with the story of season  you have practically a very good show.

5148264,0,t1_cv5qquy,To clarify before I talk about this I am a Markiplier fan. Not a rabid fan who would be literally crying due to this but I watch most of his videos and like his channel.I feel a bit bad for him if its anything near as bad as he and his friends are making it out to be and I dont think its like a broken bone or anything like some people are saying because of the reaction they had. I know its likely a exaggerated reaction but I dont think theyre that bad that they would exaggerate a broken bone to the point theyre talking about it right now.I disagree with people that say theyre crying over this because its literally a tweet with no context or info or anything at all. If its a death like some people are saying it is then I think that Markiplier and his friends reaction was mostly justified but they shouldnt have gone to social media without clarifying anything and making a dramatic statement.I could have waved it off if just one of the people had posted it as an impulse thing but all of them doing it makes me think its something other then that like you said.I think that people should wait for more info before making rumoursand literally crying. Im going to wait for the actual info on what happened before making my absolute judgement. They said it was coming later this week.

But instead of actually telling stories that would be a bit boring to watch they have flashbacks to their favorite moments from their channel IE maybe Tom shows finding the city in his OG minecraft series and Jordan shows when he first saw Jerrys Tree . etcIt would be more editingheavy but it could be a fun weekly thing until they start a new series.

5894460,0,t1_cxqtq1t,Well I mean Im flattered. Nice to see some positive feedback on our efforts toward the reddit community. I for one believe that this community is an important one and that should it wish to have some input on the MMO then it can.I have tried as much as I can to be active on the subreddit and help where I can I was not around for much of the interaction with BTS crew from season  so I can not really comment on that but there has been a definite effort to try and foster a more positive outlook for the MMO. Personally I think that Tom is the crux of the argument when talking about season  if Tom wanted to do it in  weeks it would get done. But at the moment he seems fairly happy not playing minecraft and so the issue of when season  will occur still remains. as you have stated everyone else is off doing their own thing and for the most part not really missing mianite other than Waglington. ,TheRealmOfMianite,cxsaqfk,1,t5_32pei

7766792,0,t3_4lmi79,Yeah from my interpretations Mianite wasnt exactly evil. He was just jealous of Dianite as depicted in the Frayed Father book and did things er...  Differently  Also I think it was established early on that even if Dianite and Mianite swapped sides Ianite would always stay neutral. If you flip over something neutral itll stay neutral. Besides she already was a tad bit evil by accidentally letting the town get wrecked by her taint p So I dont think this is whats going to happen in S. It would also get repetitive. Not much of a bunch of gods if you need mortals to keep saving them haha. Instead I hope to see Spark Sir Jeriah and Alyssa finally! Especially Spark vs Sparklez fighting for Ianite would be the best xD And maybe more Mot x Dianite p,TheRealmOfMianite,d3p0tr0,5,t5_32pei

8155513,0,t3_4qz1vx,The MMO is still happening as far as I know as one of the guys working on it confirmed it a while ago. As for season  who knows. They apparently confirmed it at one of the Insomnias but the chances of it happening are not likely as Tom is busy vlogging and its currently zombies season while Tucker and Jordan seem to be enjoying success on their own channels through other content. I also think Sonja is doing fine as well. So personally I highly doubt season  will happen unless the MMO revives interest in it when its released.,TheRealmOfMianite,d4wzjr9,2,t5_32pei

10384875,0,t3_5op5b8,Short answer Yes. You should also check out Trollcraft. Though it has the same small amount of interaction between players its worth seeing everyones reactions and retaliations.Back to Mianite though. Each player has their specialization if you dont like Jordan and his tech watch Tucker and his blood magic Sonja with Thaumcraft or Waglington and his wizardly Ars Magica ways.Wag has some good vids and I highly suggest them. They are edited down too so its easier to catch up on story stuff.Sonja does some interesting stuff too if you dont mind the obnoxious CLICKITY CLACK of her mechanical keyboard.So those are my suggestions. Check out wag first then Tucker and Sonja. That is if youre bored with Jardons stuff.,TheRealmOfMianite,dcl6ugf,4,t5_32pei
