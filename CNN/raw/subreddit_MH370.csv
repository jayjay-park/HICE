581649,0,t3_20sohf,Have they been killed can terrorists kill  persons in a row so easily ?Pilot can depressurize the plane.  This would cause the air masks to drop giving  minutes of air according to the  manual.  The pilots have their own system that provides  hours of air.  So after  minutes all passengers would become unconscious then dead soon after.If theyve been killed how anyone didnt notice such a butchery ?If they havent been able to find any trace of an enormous plane there is no reason to think they would have found any bodies.  If the plane did land somewhere a mass grave might be the most likely scenario to dispose of the bodies.How someone didnt manage to escape when they landed ?If everyone was killed in flight there would be nobody left to escape.  If they did land with the passengers alive they were probably met by a force with guns or other weapons which would not allow them to escape.  Also if they landed it is almost certainly in a very remote area or it would have been found already.  So if someone did escape they are facing days or weeks of travelling through difficult terrain with no supplies.  The most likely result would be death before they found help.,MH370,cg6dz1n,4,t5_30v0f

653757,0,t3_21kcuu, The last ping tells us the radius of the arc on which the airplane could have landed.       The group of pings tells us that the airplane most likely did not deviate turn a bunch in a circle too much from a straight path from when it was lost on radar to its final resting place.       The predicted fuel left after losing radar contact tells us where on the arc the straightish line segment could intersect the radius arc.       The jet flew faster than previously estimated means that during the time that the jet was on radar it used more fuel than previously thought. Therefore theres less fuel and the line segment in  is shorter than predicted before.      tldr They analyzed more radar data of before the airplane went off radar to get a better idea of how much fuel they had left for after they went off radar. And the result was they had less fuel for the journey into the Indian Ocean.,MH370,cgekyid,2,t5_30v0f

Can anybody here explain this ? Wouldnt this only apply if the plane had a tailwind equal to its airspeed at altitude and none at ground level ? Reporter error ? Did he say could be rather than was ? I know you actually travel further at altitude due to a greater global circumference than at sea level i.e. distance stretch but the mean circumference of the earth   k at sea level  k at  feet only  . greater.

Also when developing a model to analyse data it is natural to begin with a simple model that captures broad features of the data. Further refinement and tweaking can be built on that but may take more time to develop.  Thats simply additional analysis not brilliant design of a forward thinking extensible system. Thats Inmarsat marketing spin. Unless you think they really left a few columns in their spreadsheet to factor in the temperature of the satellite? If they knew these other factors need to be added to find the real search area why send the data off prematurely. It could only result in a fruitless search and waste of time and money.I realize the numbers theyre dealing with are really small and really minor factors like that can make significant difference.  That temperature stuff has the feel of a smoke screen another attempt to prevent outside analysis or of someone trying to back their predictions into the actual search results. There will be a lot of dollars out there after this is over in PR books appearances and sales for anyone who can reasonably claim that they have a high tech approach that was highly accurate.

A sound at .khz would lose almost dB per km due to absorption alone ignoring spherical spread losses where a much lower frequency sound loses intensity at magnitudelower rates.

1498665,0,t1_cj3sngd,I saved this conversation is this of some relevance? Is it possible that solely the outgoing Acars was disabled? And if the outgoing Acars app was reactivated at . surely there must be some data footprint somewhere that would show whether CPDLC via ArincVHF was used to send texts then? If this data proof was not included in the ISAT release where should it be found? Wheres the proof that CPDLC was not being used  and unless I have missed this has anyone even been asking ISAT for this? The focus has very much been on Acars package content.by Ian W  ACARS was only licensed and activated on VHF by the Malaysians it was not linked to INMARSAT SATCOM or to Boeing or Rolls Royce health monitoring. So the ACARS logonlogoff would be an ARINCSITA protocol over VDL which I believe is ARINC  ATS Data Link Applications over ACARS or  AirGround CharacterOriented Protocol Specification.Iantwo points.  I cant see described in any of the protocols a logoff message nor for that matter a log on at the ACARS level i.e. a message that would indicate that the ACARS system was logging off rather than that the underlying transport layer was logging off. Equally I am certain that the VHF transport layer does not log on or logoff as it is just open radio spectrum. People have speculated the authorities have some indication the ACARS was logged off in a conscious deliberate way. I can see no basis in the technology being used that would allow that possibly to be concluded with respect to the ACARS system. As such I believe it is certain to have been a turn of phrase used by someone in an early briefing rather than anything relevant.  People have represented that Malaysian Airlines did not use the satcom for ACARS yet the official preliminary report declares it did  and that the  ACARS message was transmitted via satcom link and finally there is a satcom message originating from the aircraft at just before  and finishing just after .QuoteOriginally Posted by Preliminary ReportIt was later established that the transmissions from the Aircraft Communication and Reporting System ACARS through satellite communication system occurred at regular intervals starting before MH  departed Kuala Lumpur Malaysia at time  MYT and with the last communication occurred at  MYT.I had originally assumed the attribution of link layer satcom vs VDL was an error. However at this remove if it was an error it would have been corrected. Also it exactly matches the timing of the Inmarsat final packet acknowledgement from the aircraft to the exact second.I therefore believe subject to some conclusive evidence of MA nonuse of Satcom for ACARS that MH was using Satcom as its ACARS link layer. And therefore the reason we have no VDL ACARS logs for MH is because it wasnt using VDL not because they exist but have not been released.I think it far more likely that CPDLC or VHF logs have not been released because they do contain significant info. Wherever data has been omitted thats the sensitive info imo. ,MH370,cj44rm1,2,t5_30v0f

Also a closed cell foam material would keep water out.gt Also dispersal on the ocean is fast random and unpredictable.All the drift models say different.  The random models tend to show every direction as feasible but the debris would all be subject to the same general drift forces initially and speed and dispersal should really depend on wind resistance and buoyancy. The different speeds the different pieces end up under different forces and start to take different courses.Its really unreasonable to think that something like the flaperon would be totally unique and totally removed from all other parts by drift.  The loss of buoyancy of many items over time makes more sense.In the first diagram that buoy was six months behind the plane debris and managed to catch up to the flaperon.  That says slow moving flaperon to me.In the second the buoy was caught up in the same general area for  months then headed to Reunion.  That area is further west.

8925639,0,t3_52i99x,TLDR  This is my quick personal interpretation the articles author might not agree with this summary!    A leak in a hose connected to the pilots emergency oxygen supply met a spark somewhere and caused a blowtorchlike effect that quickly burned a large hole through the aluminum fuselage. According to the FAA an accident identical to this happened to another Boeing  parked on the ground not in flight in .   While the oxygen leak rapidly exhausted the pilots emergency oxygen supply the fuselage hole rapidly decompressed the aircraft.   Applying the principle of Aviate Navigate Communicate the pilots shut down some electrical systems disconnected the autopilot began manually descending and manually changed direction towards the nearest airport on the Malay peninsula.   Before successfully communicating the pilots lost consciousness.   The planes automatic stability system separate from the autopilot leveled out the flight.   The locked cockpit doors prevented any passengers with their separate oxygen supply from entering the cockpit.  Eventually the passenger oxygen supply would have also run out and all remaining people on board would have lost consciousness.   The plane continued on across the Malay peninsula and the encountered a large thunderstorm on the far side of the peninsula.   The turbulence of the thunderstorm buffeted and rocked the plane with its autopilot still turned off causing its direction to change.   After exiting the storm the planes automatic stability system stabilized the flight in its new direction.   As there were no more thunderstorms in the planes path it continued on in the new direction until fuel exhaustion.  This is the first theory of MH that really makes sense to me.  A cool thing about this theory is that the flight data recorder with its  hour recording loop should be able to prove or disprove it.,MH370,d7kqbhe,13,t5_30v0f

If max elevation angle to get a signal is say  degrees above the horizontal plane the aircraft cannot be higher than ft. Stated otherwise to receive a signal flying at ft distance km the effective elevation angle  would need to be gt degrees. Considering the drop in RF power over distance and elevation it seems highly improbable that the range km and the altitude ft can both be right.Perhaps somebody here with industry knowledge could apply some arbitrary minimum threshold RF required for cellphone registration and depict the profile of max altitude vs distance for a typical antenna radiation pattern.,MH370,d9yaxk6,5,t5_30v0f

10367327,0,t3_5ogi83,This didnt seem possible. I always assumed theyd find it at some point.  That a commercial airplance could disappear  even after veering off course and traveling through airspace actively monitored by multiple nations and militaries at any given time even after small pieces of wreckage were found and even after great minds utilized groundbreaking techniques to analyze satellite ping data  seemed even less likely than Brexit or Trump imho.   This is disappointing to put it mildly. Hopefully everyone who lost someone on that flight somehow finds closure.,MH370,dcj75zp,42,t5_30v0f

11326673,0,t1_dfe85dk,Do you object to anything Ive said?  If not you are merely deflecting attention from it.But unlike many in the MH online chat community sk I always identify myself clearly on all my comments and communications.  I happen to be Canadian.  My attitude is that it could have been my tax dollars.  More importantly it could have been my loved ones on the plane.I consider myself a member of open governmentseekers without borders.  You are more than welcome to join.  I really need your help.,MH370,dffuydv,1,t5_30v0f
11341537,0,t1_dfhip1w,That theory was posted here a while back not very credible IMHO.A free book from a pilot that was being hyped and advertised i.e. paying for people to read it didnt sound very promising.Actually the pilot bit came a bit late to me I stereotype pilots as smart technical people but they do seem to be a bit collegiate and less than rational when accidents occur.,MH370,dfhjkrc,2,t5_30v0f
