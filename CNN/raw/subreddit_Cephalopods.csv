36436,0,t1_ceikdws,I personally saw at least  squid in the freezer yesterday. As for the age group I find that nd  th graders are the most interested but Im sure kindergartners would love to see it. It does get pretty smelly but I feel it is definitely made for students before they dissect frogs or fetal pigs. Also If you say need multiple for several classes we can send multiple in one box cheaper shipping.,Cephalopods,ceikvsr,0,t5_2qo0k
