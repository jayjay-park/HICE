111460,0,t3_1vca99,Welcome to the city!Shoot me a message if you ever want to meet at a Crew game Im at just about every home game in the supporters section Nordecke.I was born in Columbus and have lived here all my life. Im an urban planner and got my bachelors and masters degrees from OSU which means I more or less spent  years studying Columbus its neighborhoods and suburbs in depth. SoWhere to Live Youre a young professional. The Short North Arena District Victorian Village Harrison West Italian Village Brewery District and even Downtown lots of residential development happening downtown are really the most vibrant areas and many young professionals live there. If youre looking for something a little quieter and sleepy but still near the city Id recommend Grandview Franklin Park Bexley Clintonville or Old Towne East. If youre the suburban type Westerville Worthington Dublin Gahanna Grove City and Hilliard arent bad. No matter where you live you can generally get across town in less than  minutes save for rush hour which can vary but commutes between downtown to the burbs are generally  minutes in peak rush hour. Either way though many commute by bike in the neardowntown neighborhoods youll need a car. Our COTA bus system is simply not adequate or reliable enough.Where to eat Columbus is a fast food test market theres everything! s... While thats true there are several great restaurants in Columbus. Many of them are located in the Short North but there are others scattered throughout town. My favorites that arent in the Short North include Dreylese for West African cuisine Old Towne Tavern for good pub food Schmidts for German food Thurmans for a ridiculous burger Aab India for some awesome Indian cuisine Milestone  for a fresh take on American cuisine Myas fried chicken Yellow Brick Pizza and Hound Dogs Pizza mmm sauerkraut pizza with smokin joes crust... just try it KatalinasTasiAngry BakerKnead are all great breakfast places One LineCafe BriosoStaufsUpper Cup are all great coffee places and finally Golden Valley for Chinese. Be sure to check out North Market as well! Theres lots of great food and specialty shops there. This is not an exhaustive list just some of my favorites. Theres lots more great restaurants here and plenty I havent been to or dont even know about. We also have a great food truck scene which includes the Food Truck Festival at Columbus Commons every summer. theres also lots of farmers markets around town during the warmer months and my personal favorite is the one at Pearl and Lynn Alleys.What to do Columbus has plenty of neat things and Ohio in general is fun to explore. No we dont have huge mountains endless beaches but theres plenty of enjoyable things to do. Columbus has a great Metro Park System to explore. The city parks are great too. The Audubon Park has an outdoor climbing wall. The Scioto Mile is great for a downtown stroll and Columbus Commons has regular events happening on its outdoor stage. The Park of Roses is rated as one of the top  rose gardens in The US and Franklin Park Conservatory is a delight to explore particularly with its special art exhibits and butterfly events. We have the Blue Jackets for Hockey The Columbus Clippers for AAA Baseball their ballpark is top notch! the Crew for soccer and OSU is more or less our pro football and basketball fix. Ohio Stadium holds as many as  on game days and if youre anywhere near campus on game day its nothing but tailgating and parties. The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is one of the nations best and Zoombezi bay is nearby the zoo for some water park fun. The Columbus Museum of Art isnt huge its expansion is under construction but has an excellent collection and the Wexner Center for the Arts on OSUs campus often has interesting shows and exhibits come through. The Statehouse is fun to tour as well for a brief Ohio history lesson and to get a feel for Ohios natural history check our Orton Hall on OSU campus for a small but informative collection complete with fossils and geological things. COSI is fun and often plays host to exhibits ranging from the bodies Exhibit to the Titanic exhibit. The Palace Theater and Ohio Theater often host the big name comedians I saw Gallagher at the palace once musicals orchestras popular broadway shows and ballets.Bars Beer and MusicComedy Venues Most important thing right? Columbus has seen a great craft brewery explosion and so has most of Ohio. In turn most bars in Columbus will have some sort of local or Ohio beer on tap. That said Seventh Son Brewing North High Brewing Columbus Brewing Company Elevator Brewing Company Barleys Brewing Company Rockmill Brewery Four String Brewing Company and Zauber Brewing Company are all local. That list doesnt include Brothers Drake Meadery Watershed Distillery or Middle West Spirits makers of OYO spirits. Most of these breweries have their own bars attached to their brewing facilities so feel free to check them out! Even with that theres even more craft brewers all around Ohio in Cincinnati Cleveland Dayton Toledo Athens and even in some smaller towns like Yellow Springs. Needless to say youll be able to try a new brew at almost any bar that you go to bars that are somewhat local that is. For great selection I recommend Bodega who has a great halfoff drafts happy hour but get there before  otherwise it gets super packed and you may not be able to sit Old Towne Tavern for more of a low key experience with a pretty strong selection bit Barcade for a pretty good selection and about  arcades games that are free to play and even World of Beer they just have so many beers! Did I mention we have a few craft beer festivals each year? Ive been to the summer fest and the Winter fest is this weekend... Its delightful! Crew fans tend to meet up at th Street Bar amp Grill before games and parking lot tailgates at Crew Stadium. Fados Irish pub is also a great place to watch soccer and I believe theyre open early for Premier League viewing on Saturdays. If youre feeling like getting schwastyface drunk pretty much any bar on High Street around OSUs campus has you covered. Park Street just South of Goodale St. is also extremely popular though its not really my crowd. Not sure what Kind of music youre into but Circus Bar hosts Thump Wednesdays for your fill of dance music generally bass music but theyve been switching it up recently and theres also Restart Quality and Squared for some quality house music. Theres also several oneoff and monthlyish events like LeBoom at Skullys Music diner great venue where they generally bring in some midsized up and coming electronic acts. Finally The Bluestone is a venue that used to be an old church that occasionally brings headlining dance music acts to Columbus. Though it seems that they bring mostly country acts now that theyve changed their name to the Bluestone from BoMA Bar of Modern Art. Theres also the shittily named Sugar Bar  and Sugar Bar  which both occasionally bring a headliner. Otherwise youll probably see most of your concerts at Nationwide Arena the LC AampR Music Bar The Basement and Newport Music Hall. Youll find most comedians at The Funnybone and Shadowbox Cabaret is fairly entertaining as well. Ive even seen some great amateur stand up in the basement venue of Sidebar .Also make sure to check out Columbus Undergroundwww.columbusunderground.com for some good timely Columbus info and  for a list of festivals around Ohio. See ohioVibe.net for a calendar of events for dance music in Columbus.That should be enough to get you started! Otherwise feel free to PM if you have any questions.,Columbus,cer4f3t,1,t5_2r373

184815,0,t3_1w6x84,We can do better than this guys... From Columbus to Cincy A travelers guidebook.North to South  interchange traffic sucks.Driving South you pass Berliner park to your left if you look carefully just before that you can see the watertower and climbing wall at Audubon. DaNite Sign company sign is on your right as you are passing Berliner  They advertise some of the signs that they have made on the display of their own sign so meta.Shortly after there is a water treatment facility on the left and some prisons male on the right female on the left I believe.Wait were all stopping why? Oh look a giant pothole in the left lane better try not to run right through it... we must be at the  interchange and the Stringtown Rd. Exit.  lane here please. Hey a new hospital is going in on the left... the New Grove City Hospital is being built... will they add an exit here? That would be so helpful for traffic.Just a bit farther on the right is the good ole Columbus Dump smells worse driving North.Just past it on the right is a house that is ALWAYS selling AKC Pug Puggies always. Just across the highway on the left is that stock fishing lake right now there is no action but in the summer its super busy. Why does this catch my eye? Because its a super tiny man made hole in the ground that a bunch of people stand around in the summer. Drive a bit farther and you start going down a gradual hill. This I believe is the beginning or the north end of the Cincinnati Arch a geological feature. You go across a little creek Big Walnut I think? then you begin the ascent to the highest point in the area. Blah blah blah exit names  something about that hotel turned into an antique store but really just an empty building that is always for sale london exit?Add a rd lane st outlet area with the huge gun store and the skill games shop is that a human trafficking location looks shady...Real outlet malls giant McDonalds parking lot BBQ place on the left with a pig on the sign. Sad empty looking truck garage on the right which usually has an add on the billboard above it about how they are hiring. Theres a Lions Den at that exit too for those of you on the sex shop state tour.Drive past a Rest Stop  drops to  lanes but people will be driving slow and you can usually drive almost to the end of the left lane before merging to get an extra boost.Nothing exciting for a while here you go past a big ass dealer of farm implements on the left at some point... there is the house with the additional second story that is held up by long  by s on the left and another house that is right before an overpass which has a big orange sphere in the power lines WHY IS THAT THERE...? Been wondering for  years.Eventually theres the RL carriers exit with the ever empty convention center on the right and its very bright sign. After that I really only see Caesars Creek the construction around Wilmington that indicates that the big bridge is coming the big bridge that weird spire tower on the right side of the road when you pass Lebanon and Kings Island. Then theres Kings Automall the  interchange and traffic. Thats all I got for the Cincy part I usually get off at Kings Mill exit. TLDR  Its boring but if you do it a ton you see all sorts of weird details. P.S. The big bridge spans the Little Miami River Valley. There is a lot of humanity down in that valley. You drive over a couple Canoe Liveries homes Ft. Ancient YMCA Camp Kern and other stuff. Pretty cool are actually. The bridge construction has a story according to wikipedia we are around stage . I have heard many other rumors about the bridge and the whole replacement process but nothing is mentioned in this article. ,Columbus,cezhkjz,7,t5_2r373

603804,0,t3_211qn8,Man I cannot say enough good things about it.  I had some interactions with the guys who were installing it through my job and ended up having a brief chat with Munros photographer who was nice enough to show me some of his photos on his computer before the exhibit opened.I thought they all looked really cool and went pretty much the first day it opened back in October but even still I was really really impressed!  I went after dark and man it was worth the  or whatever that I paid to get in.  I dont know what I expected but some of it was out of this world.We worked our way through the zen garden thing with the pillars of bottles which was great the indoor simulated rain forest thunderstorm someone mentioned which was also really atmospheric and enjoyable though I wish it represented better on film and finally out into the courtyard for the field of light which was by far my favorite part of the exhibit.  The way they changed color was such that the ones near you just seemed to subtly shift but the lights in the distance would sort of... shimmer.  Like there was a wave going through them.  It was cool up close but when viewed from afar it really gave a sense of connectedness  one that was further enhanced by the visible fiberoptics running through the whole courtyard which reminded me of nothing so much as a nervous system.  I mean it was beautiful but it was also a bit like watching a dynamic living system.  Like a bunch of individual flowers all connected to the same root system and on the surface it looks like countless discrete objects but you take enough steps back and you can see all of them as part of the whole.It was genuinely transformative Ive seen that courtyard in the light of day and it doesnt look a damn thing like that.  I felt like I was in Avatar or something.  My cheesy description doesnt do it justice  its a really cool and otherworldly experience.  The giant dome of plastic bottles was pretty neat too as was the globeswithinglobes display on the rooftop.  Im actually planning on going again this weekend before it leaves but Im kind of kicking myself for not getting out there to see it when there was snow on the ground.  Im sure that added to the experience as well especially with the field of light.  If anyone happened to take any photos of that Id be super interested in seeing them!,Columbus,cg8wmnl,9,t5_2r373

652487,0,t3_21lo9d,Ive had no experience with this group. However years ago I believe they occupied a building on campus on th Avenue. During this time they booked some shows in the basement of the building. The venue was called Red  And not just Christian music. They booked hipster indie bands and occasional punk bands shit like that. I actually saw a couple very good shows there. What I thought was odd besides the fact that I was seeing these bands in a church basement was the venue itself. It was a BYOB place and you had to turn over your beer to the staff when you arrived. So each time you wanted a beer you went up to the window and showed them your ID to get a can or two of the beer you brought. Plus they didnt have a stage per se. What they had was  old plastic milk crates strung together on the floor with a big piece of plywood on top. So the stage was a mere  or so inches above the floor and against the wall.I tried to google the place and all I found was a yelp review where the guy mentions the place having problems after a punk or rap show that got out of control.Perhaps this concert venue scheme was a way to get people to check out the church.,Columbus,cgefrg7,2,t5_2r373

A few points that Im not certain I agree with you on This is not malicious.  You still seem to be relating to this as though its some nefarious scheme its not.  Government is inherently in the business of distribution of scarce resources  thats part of the point of government to begin with.  Using influence on things like tax codes to represent the interests of importantorganized groups of constituents is normative acceptable behavior.  In a different context this might constitute some form of theft but within the realm of policymaking I think making proposals that show favor to groups one is more dependent upon is regarded as a given not some moral transgression. Would this be the first time political strategy has undermined or destabilized some important aspect of government?  No nor would it be the last.  Despite what they say the primary goal of an elected official is to stay an elected official  you cant do anything if youre booted out of office.  Their actual priorities are often very different from what their rhetoric indicates.If you could pass through a tax cut that would earn you a degree of favor with valued demographics while also being able to spin it as a general tax cut that in essence gives back to the people rather than using their money to fund wasteful government practices thats a winwin.  Still not really sure how you could look at this and think its outlandish paranoia along the same vein as conspiracy theorists.,Columbus,chnbsnd,4,t5_2r373

Youre setting them and yourself up for failure without people in the seats. People dont have a night out in Grove City unless they live in Grove City. But people come from everywhere to go downtown. Theres only like  open mics in the city so theres plenty of opportunity to add another or give some local comedians and actual  minutes and give them half of the door earnings. Also are there even improv shows in town besides at Wild Goose?... Ive never seen or heard of any others and I lived downtown for three years.

2546275,0,t1_cmqvzmj,Good comments thanks for being critical without being disparaging. I should also say that Im not a spokesperson for this movement and my opinions should not be taken as representative of the protesters. This is a community driven movement and Im just one person who is attending the protestsrallies. I believe the letter to the CPD was penned by Timothy Singratsomboune.    . Other civilian review boards such as in NY Las Vegas etc. review civilian complaints against the police. Some boards have subpoena power and some just provide recommendations. Im not sure exactly how this would be implemented but this is just one of the initial steps to start creating police accountability to citizens. If nothing else this could make complaints more public and put the police in the spotlight.  . I disagree. Of course police are supposed to be color blind but racial bias in police shootings is prevalent across the country. Black male teens are x more likely to be shot by police than their white counterparts. There are studies with the numbers as referenced in articles like this one   But also take a look at high profile cases across the country There are plenty of examples of nonblack killers such as Timothy McVeigh James Holmes one of the Boston bombers etc. apprehended alive. Meanwhile unarmed black men and women are being killed so frequently the news cannot catch up with them all.  . I agree   . I think this is a bigger issue inside the city than outside. Communities particularly of color for example on the Eastnear East sideSouth side feel that the officers policing their area are not representative of them and want that to change. As a white man who has lived all over the city I have almost never encountered the police. But people of color have a totally different experience. A black woman at the rally Monday spoke on how she was pulled over by the police every week for a year for no good reason.  . I agree,Columbus,cmqxo51,0,t5_2r373

If it wasnt for this the libertarians would have eliminated social security of all forms because the argument would be that an individual can determine for themselves what they want to focus on and not. We dont need disability from the government because we could then buy our own STD or LTD coverages and they might be right theoretically but on a practical basis thats never going to happen. The same argument can be applied for retirement savings even medical insurance and so on. To some extent theyre right too.

4134768,0,t3_37xpc6,This wont be popular advice for this subreddit so people not looking for the typical Ra ra Columbus advice read at your own peril. In all honesty some of your worries match my own pet peeves with the city so if youre truly worried I would take the concerns seriously. Maybe try to visit for a week if youre actually considering moving here. gt I love Colorado because of the recreation that is available here and that I fit in and wake upWhile there are definitely active people here and trails to run on your options are going to be constrained compared to what youre familiar with in NorCal and Colorado. This is I think more a Midwest and topographical problem than anything thats particular at issue with Columbus. The Midwest just doesnt have the same sort of mountain ranges or sprawling federal parks like the Western parts of the US.gt Is this hard in Ohio? Is it like Minnesota where people make their friends in highschool and never need any new ones?People here are Ive found actually pretty friendly. Lots of people do still know and have friends from high school I dont personally but Ive had no trouble meeting new people. gt  The climate data suggests cold and overcast much of the year. Is this true?Yes. This is one of my major gripes with the city. The cold doesnt really bother me but the constant cloudiness especially in the winter is depressing. Summer is much better though it is currently  degrees outside. gt Does everyone really only care about OSU football as the internet seems to think?I also couldnt care less about sports. If my experience is any guide OSU football will come up in the conversation and youll just have to tune out or learn to love it. If you live close to the OSU campus it will be something youll have to deal with traffic drunk people noise. Though I do have a few friends who feel the same way I do there are so many people here who seem to be very invested in OSU football that I just assume it of most people I meet by default. Ive never liked sports and not sharing that with a good percentage of the population does make for a bit more of an alienating experience. To sum up Id say that Columbus isnt a bad city just very mediocre. There arent opportunities here that one cant find elsewhere and you wont be overwhelmed by your options. If you come here looking for the same options youd find in a place like New York or wilderness like youd find in Colorado youre going to be disappointed. I dont mean any of this to come across as bitter or acrimonious. Im just trying to share a side that doesnt often get good representation when people ask these sorts of questions. ,Columbus,crrl1v1,1,t5_2r373

4249621,0,t1_cs48tg7,I had a coworker that was a member.He was actually a really nice guy and never tried to recruit me or anything like that which makes me kinda have my doubts about them actually being a cult.  The only reason I even knew he was affiliated with Xenos was because he was on vacation in the Outer Banks when that guy drowned recently and I asked him about it.From my conversations with him the only red flag was one time we were discussing gay marriage which he seemed to generally support and he mentioned he had multiple friends who at one time were gay but that was no longer the case and seemed to think that gay people should give being straight the ol college try again first.  He definitely wasnt anti gay people or anything though.It was pretty odd because I would generally say he was well above average intelligence and while I didnt agree with him on some issues I could always at least understand and respect his points of view.Overall it seemed like the church had a positive influence in this guys life and I didnt feel like he was brain washed or being taken advantage of or any other negative things I would associate with a cult.  He definitely interacted socially with non church members outside of work.Im not saying they arent a cult and from what Ive read on here it sounds like there are many people having very different experiences with them.  Im just saying that at the very least people shouldnt be dismissed as cult members just because theyre associated with Xenos.,Columbus,cs4n9lx,9,t5_2r373

Many of the downtown lanes are going to get dedicated bike lanes some of those streets have had a lane under construction for a while and it didnt adversely impact traffic much showing that theres more capacity than is needed.  Ive gone biking with city traffic engineers on various downtown streets helping them to identify what roads could use bike lanes and what are the challenges faced as a bicycle commuter.Many downtown intersections will also be getting bike boxes also known as Copenhagen left turns.  A green box will be painted on the pavement at intersections along with appropriate signage informing motorists of the purpose of the box.  When you need to do a left hand turn you continue past the intersection stop and pull into the bike box.  When the light turns youre then free to continue on.They plan to roll out the bike boxes and other infrastructure improvements downtown first to get feedback from both bicyclists and motorists on how they perform after a trial period theyll start evaluating other areas of the city that would benefit from those types of improvements.Connect Columbus has more information on the infrastructure improvements including the bike boxes and I think theres a map of the first streets that will be getting those improvements.

4674830,0,t3_3env1c,The dog who died was the dog of my wifes niece and Ashley contacted my wife immediately since she is very informed about dog topics. Here is what is known Jude got very sick one morning with vomiting diarrhea and afterwards a seizure. He was taken to the vet and they gave supportive care as well as activated charcoal  which may be able to absorb some toxins. He seemed to be doing somewhat better Ashley was taking him to her mothers home to watch him while she was at work when he had some bloody vomiting. He was taken immediately to the nearest vet ER and died a short time later. Jude had not had exposure to any known toxin around the house. He had been to the dog park about one day earlier. Originally Ashley didnt associate the dog park with the sickness. The original vet thought it sounded like a toxic reaction. Ashely asked around and heard that two other dogs had died with similar symptoms. Important I do not know if this has been verified or if it is just rumor. I do not know if Ashley was able to contact these people.Many people online are speculating about what this could be. Much of it is inconsistent with his symptoms. These are not the symptoms of warfarin poisoning rat poison. That would be simply massive bleeding including into the peritoneum and brain. Jude had no bleeding until about a day after symptoms started. This is not pesticide poisoning as some people without basis speculated online. Columbus does not spray pesticides on its parks and pesticide poisoning to cause these symptoms would have to be massive such as drinking the stuff rather than just getting some from grass. The symptoms DO fit mushroom poisoning Note that  cap can kill a human obviously much less for a dog. they also say that they are reputed to taste good. Odd to note thatOnset of symptoms was about right about a day and the other symptoms fit. Ashley did not see Jude eat a mushroom but there was a potential for mushrooms to be around because of how wet it had been. I would EMPHASIZE that this is at the moment only speculation and best guess. They exhumed Judes body and are performing studies to see if it is possible to determine the actual cause. It may well not be the cause and it may be actually unrelated to Wheeler dog park. Columbus has been very very good in their response. They immediately closed the park and have called in experts to examine the park. Perfect response.

I said absolutely no such thing.  Is it hard for you to have a discussion without hyperbole? Or do you immediately jump to some asinine extreme?I never said anything about any economic status.  I said that a child of  years of age should be supervised by their parents if playing off of their property premises.  I have a  year old daughter.  Damn sure better believe when she was  if she left the yard to go play she was supervised.   Years old is not old enough to be left alone.  Thats negligence on the parents.  If they were too busy to properly raise their child DONT FUCKING HAVE ONE. If Tamir had been white why you keep bringing race into this I dont know.  A white  year old child waving a gun pointing it at innocent people would get shot just the same.  Color has nothing to do with it.  Its not a RIGHT to wave around a gun in a public place.  Whether you are  or  white or black rich or poor.  Regardless of color of economic status a parent should be supervising their children. Teaching them its NOT okay to wave and point a gun at people.

The top of the screen vignetting you noticed was because at the time we hadnt been able to project without the bottom of the previous frame showing up at the top of the screen because of the nature of projecting in Ultra Panavision that I mentioned below earlier. I know none of this matters when you paid your money and youre sitting in the theater expecting it to be perfect but it was a wild week of one freak issue after another. We know it didnt get to the level of presentation we aimed for on day one but we were legitimately solving screeningending issues right up to showtime.

When I first moved to Cbus in  my closest store was the one at th and High BEFORE it was renovated. That experience permanently tainted Kroger for me.Giant Eagle is too expensive. I also despise their self checkout policy of not being able to use it without first scanning that stupid loyalty card. Thanks assholes  I have an arm full of groceries but let me dig out that card first.When I want to do a significant amount of shopping its split between Costco and Meijer with Kroger as a fillin when I dont want to make the drive to those. Aldi is good for some stuff especially staples for baking. And Marcs is a weird store that I like anyway because it carries a lot of brands that nobody else does. Trader Joes for specific things.Luckys  I really like the idea of Luckys but hate the practice. Theyre expensive and the employee turnover is ridiculous.

Columbus Brew Adventures as mentioned isnt a bad idea and Experience Columbus has some packages that might be worth checking out.    ampnbsp    Also when in doubt remember you know your friends better than anyone they likely are fine with whatever you would get them.

Those folks may have changed though or at least gotten the rough edges knocked off of them.  Stonewalls good though.    Theres not many support groups that I know of here other than the ones that Whethervayne mentioned.  I know that stonewall has a queerfriendly business directory called Lavender Listings.  I know theyre not support groups and you may want to run screaming away from anything religious depending on what youve been through but that being said there are some religious folks that are friendly to trans people as well the Unitarian Universalists being among them  Theres another more protestant sect that I dont remember I think their name had to do with christ or brethren or united or something.  ,Columbus,d2g2glp,2,t5_2r373

7499094,0,t1_d2ukn54,So I have a few different experiences to share.The first time I was stopped was very bizarre.  Im driving down the road and get lit up by a State Trooper.  I pull in to a parking lot roll down the window and put my hands on the steering wheel.  I did not have a gun on me.  So the guy comes up to my car hes a younger guy and hes very nervous.  He has his hand on his sidearm!  Asks me for my license and registration and then says Dont you have something else to tell me?  Ummm no?  I wasnt sure what he was fishing for.  But he was still really nervous.  Goes back to his car wait  minutes comes back and tells me the sticker on my license plate is  day expired.  Not registration but sticker.  Asks me again if I have anything to declare and I say no again.  He sends me on his way.  I was positive that he was looking for a reason to pull me over once he ran my plates and saw I had a CCW.  Note that if you are not carrying you do not have to declare anything to the officer pulling you over.A few years later I was going home from out of town and I did have a gun on me.  It was  AM on a Sunday morning i.e. just after the bars closed for the night.  I enter a small town without noticing the speed limit sign and get lit up.  I pull into the parking lot turn on the dome light window down hands on wheel.  As the officer gets close to my car I tell him Hi I need to let you know that Im licensed and armed.  He asks where it is I tell him its on my left hip.  He asks for my license and CCW and I tell him very plainly Ok just so you know my wallet is in my back left pocket.  Thats fine just dont touch the gun on the way to get it and well all walk away happy.  He goes back to his cruiser another two cruisers pull up I guess they were bored.  Comes back and tells me that they appreciate people who carry and inform properly and asked me to please watch my speed as I drive through his town.  I drive away with no ticket in a town that is notorious for ticketing people who go . mph over the speed limit.Final story.  This time I was doing something really stupid on I on my way back from Cleveland.  The car I had at the time could handle well over the speed I was driving but at the same time the speed I was going should have been an automatic reckless op.  I got tagged by an OHSP airplane.  So after I gave the trooper my paperwork I volunteered the fact that I was not armed.  He came back with a ticket for only the speed infraction nothing else.  That was a hellaexpensive ticket but at the same time Im sure that me volunteering my noncarrying status saved me from the extra infraction.There are very passionate debates that go on every day in gun forums about if you should notify that you are not carrying.  Some people say that its none of the governments business and its sacrificing a freedom to volunteer noncarrying status.  Others say that every traffic stop is a chance to negotiate and volunteering a noncarrying status is an extra chip in your pocket.,Columbus,d2ulwpv,6,t5_2r373

Sure it gave US subsidized agribusinesses the equitable market access in Mexico but put millions of people out of work because their unsubsidized small businesses couldnt compete.

A majority of Republicans in Louisiana  repeat in Louisiana  believe Obama was President during Hurricane Katrina.  There was that guy cable news found that thought Obama was president on .  Meanwhile youve got people saying he founded ISIS hes secretly gay he wasnt born here etc. etc. ad nauseum.  Hell the stupider leftists blame him for not closing the prison at Guatanamo Bay despite the fact that he faced nearunanimous opposition from the Senate.  And thats before you get into the fact that Obama gets blamed for stuff thats up to Congress.  Even by Congress.  Senator McConnell tried to make it Obamas fault that the Senate overrode a veto of that Saudi lawsuit thing.  My point is this if you want us to be reasonable and fairminded about this whos responsible for what at this point then it fucking sucks to be you.  As far as Im concerned starting now everything that happens is Trumps fault.  Not all jobs saved at the Carrier plant?  Trumps fault.  Economy goes south in ?  Terrorist attack next June?  Trumps fault.  Watergate?  Salem witch trials?  Shark attacks on the rise?  Lightning strike?  Trump fucking did it.

Creating systems that rely on companies to do the work of regulatory agencies is the ultimate failure though. And Im not speaking just about this situation. In general the agencies of the federal government have turned increasingly to requiring participants in their market place to be their police. Legislation and rules are created with little or no ability of the government or the agencies to actually police the behaviors. So the answer is to make the companies that participate be the policemen. What kind of system is that? If we translated this to personal life it would never fly. There would be a revolt if we compelled through threat of prosecution neighbors to rat on each other. And Im not talking about testifying in a case. Im talking about requiring people to notify police of illegal or suspicious behaviors.

Helping your child with homework or going to parent teacher conferences are just examples there are countless things that you could do to get involved with your childs education.If you did not know a parent is able to set up a meeting with a teacher so it can fit there schedule. The standard parent teacher conferences are there to give teachers  days to deal with as many parent as possible in a short period of time. But if are unable to attend you can speak with the teachers or administration and meet with them on a different datetime. All the teachers I know are extremely happy to meet with a parents and if they can not meet up then a phone call or emails. There are lots of ways you can stay in communication with teachers and administration without having to disrupt your work schedule. But it is not the Schools or the teachers job to cold call all of the students parents and force them into meetings especially when they could be teaching hundreds of kids. It is the parents responsibility to get involved with there kids schoolteachers.Not every parent is able to do everything forwith there kids but you have to find a way to do as much as possible if you want to give them the best chancesopportunities. And unfortunately there are lot of parents who pay little to no attention to there kids schooling and they almost see school as a baby sitting service.

This makes it nearly identical in terms of costs.If COTA is able to create something where I can park X times per month included in my monthly pass with express routes then it becomes even more attractive for me. Despite not saving money with COTA I get that time back in my life  I can read take care of email watch Netflix etc. and have more time in my control rather than being stuck in traffic. The end game for all of this is when we get autonomous minibuses like what Tesla has in their Masterplan version .

11205370,0,t1_df1vfrk,Theres a lack of competition at the generation level because it wouldnt make sense to have competition at the generation level.   Generally your main generation cost is fuel source.  The demand is x and the plant produces x.  If you build plant  in the territory of plant  youre looking at providing roughly .x power.  Plants are very efficient at nearly full capacity and are therefore cheaper.   Building plant  that can produce x in the territory of plant  that already produces x would result in two below optimum plants that would increase the cost of generating x.  Building plant  to have a maximum generating capacity of .x would make it more competitive but if plant  went away there wouldnt be enough power x for the demand of x power.  Its a huge investment and another reason why solar power is creeping in with a ton of tiny generation vs a massive generation block.,Columbus,df244s7,9,t5_2r373

11277159,0,t3_60wrzr,As people have said that area is heavily undergrad and also higher crime.  A lot of the landlords in that area are not the best as well.  The areas most popular with grad students are Harrison West and Clintonville and Grandview is somewhat popular as well.  These areas are all going to be more expensive than where you are currently looking but  you can find affordable places if you try.  Campus is easily accessible by bus or even foot from Harrison West and Clintonville but Grandview has buses that run less frequently and is too far to walk. I am a grad student and I personally really like Harrison West.  This is the neighborhood west of Harrison Ave east of Olentangy north of Goodale St and South of th Ave.  The area surrounded by Thurber Dr west of Goodale Park has a lot of apartment complexes which are mostly filled with grad and professional students and young professionals.  You are walking distance to the short north and downtown and campus is a  minute bus ride minute walk away.  Nearby Goodale Park is beautiful and fun to walk through.  If you look online for places in these neighborhoods be aware that landlords will claim that their property is in these neighborhoods even when it is not.  If you are unsure about an address feel free to ask me.  Is there anything in particular you would like from an apartment or neighborhood?  I am happy to give advice.,Columbus,dfa8zux,2,t5_2r373

11646993,0,t1_dgg6f1f,gt Im not forcing my believes on anyone. Just following the rules.Sorry I didnt mean to say that your comment was forcing your beliefs on someone and most certainly not in the way I was referencing e.g. evangelicals trying to legislate gay marriage to legally force their views on others.  Ive just noticed that because that type of extreme behavior is so prevalent in this state it normalizes the thoughtprocess you showed earlier it wouldnt be a problem if everyone did things the same way I do.gt Why are you forcing your illegal ! behavior on me?Im not asking you to speed.Personally I subscribe to a live and let live policy.  If people want to speed theyre going to.  And because I believe that living in a free country means allowing people to make decisions even sometimes illegal ones Im going to try my best to make sure Im not limiting their ability to do so. ,Columbus,dgg789g,3,t5_2r373
