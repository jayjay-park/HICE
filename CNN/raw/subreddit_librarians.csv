Other than buying clearly identified ads you cannot pay your way to the top of a search result.

3439437,0,t3_2zmg4l,Have you seen Hiring Librarians?Its posted on the sidebar but I think its valuable for the multitude of answers it provides to similar questions.Im in an urban public library and have no experience hiring people butWhat would you consider the top  skills that this candidate would possess? Good customer service skillspositive attitude towards customer service Knows how to conduct a reference interview Familiarity with databases and reference sources Basic technology skills not coding but MS Office how to print a PDF how to reboot a router basic troubleshooting stuff Good communication skills Programming skillsexperience storytimes teen programs etc. Teamwork  Time managementproject management skills Enthusiasm for booksreadinginformation You will hear MANY times that loving to read is in itself not a qualification to work at a library. But I wish my library had a childrens librarian who read widely enough to be good at readers advisory. Language skills besides English depending on the demographics of the neighborhood.What kind of work experiences would you be most influenced by?If they dont have previous public library experience Id want someone whod been in a customerfacing position before  with the caveat of course that there are a lot of retail and civil service jobs and unfortunately some library jobs where people do skate by being surly and doing the bare minimum. What kind of education do you value from this candidate?My library doesnt hire librarians who dont have an MLS and the job responsibilities of employees who dont have an MLS are pretty different so Id value an MLS but how much value I would put on that definitely would depend on what specific courses the candidate took  Id prefer someone who either specialized in some publiclibraryrelevant way e.g. childrens librarianship or had a good number of rigorous or technologyfocused courses. ,librarians,cpkbl8a,6,t5_2qpf2
3550791,0,t1_cpwtdew,Before I got my library job I had one year of working in a library predegrees and then three years of experience of volunteering in a library during Uni. I usually do a relevant experience section on my CV followed by a work experience section. I find this helps guide the employer through  as you can specify dates there shouldnt be confusion about the order of things. Its definitely worth spelling things out very clearly in the covering letter but honestly it could just be that the . years experience werent enough. Sometimes the person dealing with the emailssending the rejections isnt the person who makes the decisions about who to interview so they may also be struggling to make clear the reasons for you.

4414582,0,t3_3bkr42,I hate to admit it but job hunting can be about who you know.  I think it would be beneficial to call them to chat or to send a polite and friendly email.I dont know that I would specifically ask what can I do to stand out as a candidate? But you could ask for information about the position is it an existing post? What did the previous duties entail?  What kind of person are they looking for to fill the position? Is it a newly created position? Where are they looking to go with it?  etc. etc. etc.I called a university where I was applying for a job even though I didnt know anyone there.  I just had questions about the job posting and whether it matched my skills I knew it didnt but the person I talked to said they would be happy to receive my application materials and had very good information on what they wanted so I was able to tailor my materials a bit more than if I had just gone from the posting itself.Good luck!,librarians,csn9aw2,4,t5_2qpf2
4613327,0,t3_3e5c3q,Stuff likes this happens all the time and is completely inappropriate. Dont take it personally it is an issue with the specific trustee and lack of training or training that didnt takeThe board wanting to interview candidates for any position is one of my least favorites use their cousin to mow the lawn when you need a professional landscape redo member who wants more classics in the library ditch those graphic novels award winning movies and video games. I could go on.Of course the library director needs to tread lightly as the board can likely fire him or her. Start talking about the building project that will be needed to house the books the board member will want to keep. Be sure and see if there is an outside expert who can talk to the board such as someone from the state library or even an article that lets them know the cost of housing a book. It has been my experience is they will likely get bored if you have to let them get involved. Also it may be time for the board to get some more education on governance vs. management. ALA trustee academy is okay but look at Wyomings trustee troubles to see if that helps or Kentuckys trustee certification videos.There is the ever favorite taking the weeded books home ten at a time ,librarians,ctc39ik,2,t5_2qpf2

6073394,0,t3_3yp9xz,One thing I learned from my education degree that most other areas dont do is to have examples of your work.  Its one thing to talk about projects youve done its another to have something to pass around.  It makes you that much more memorable to the search committee.  Examples would be pictures of bulletin boardsdisplays youve created a proposal you wrote for a program grant writings youve been part of even an awesome spreadsheet that you made to keep track of work done or something.  Even one or two copies of something to pass around the table while you give your answer to a question like what was an interesting program you created?Another thing is to know whats happening in your field and at your library in particular.  If they ask you a generic question about technology in the field and you know your library might get a D printer say youd be interested in being on the team who learns how to use it obviously dont say this if you couldnt care less about it.  Otherwise in a situation like this the best thing to do is pretend like they dont know you but you know a whole lot about them.  ,librarians,cyfpj37,4,t5_2qpf2
6234208,0,t1_cyw4q1h,I agree this is excellent advice. During my interview presentation I engaged the audience by asking them simple questions that connected to my presentation. As someone who now attends these presentations its awful when the candidate plays Powerpoint Karaoke ie reading verbatim from slides. Also dont depend too much on the internet. Lay out your presentation so that you can make your point without the online resources just in case something goes wrong with the internet connection it wont but its good to be prepared!.

6548928,0,t3_456bwd,We just got EBSCOs discovery tool EDS so were revising all of our instructions for databases because students no longer need to pick a database before starting their search. Of course for more indepth research where they want specialized searching we tell them to pick a database and then recommend search terms. Our instructional tools include screenshots on our website click through tutorials with quizzes YouTube videos and were embedded in Moodle as class librarians at the faculty members request for researchintensive classes for those we provide some upfront instruction but its mostly answering reference questions. We do all instruction remotely over email phone and chattext so its all at point of need and typically when theyre doing research for an assignment. Personally I try to make searching seem straightforward and explain that simple yet unique search terms are best. I dont use words like Boolean and rarely explain subject terms to undergrads because I also teachwork at a twoyear community college and most students are at the very basic searching level. Library terms make it seem complicated and scary. I talk about simplifying their search query and turning their topics into search terms and talk about synonymous a bit but basically I try to explain how a library search tool is different from a web search engine like Google we have a YouTube video for this.  We also make sure to build confidence in using library tools rather than to teach them to search like librarians would. Yes theres an elegant efficient way of searching but unless youre going to grad school or into library science quick and dirty and often shallow works fine and we have to come to terms with that philosophically.Discovery tools present a challenge because databases dont share a common index of subject terms so teaching subject searching in EBSCO sometimes useful but for databases like JSTOR and ScienceDirect its not applicable. That means you have to teach the lowest common denominator in terms of searchability simple general terms and a bit of trial and error.,librarians,czwpo7n,3,t5_2qpf2

That said the MLS is totally unnecessary in my opinion personally I think we should have a shorter credentialing like a postgrad certificate maybe  classes. Having a degree doesnt make you a librarian and not having a degree doesnt make you not a librarian. Working as a librarian makes you a librarian. Do you organize information to make it easy to find and useful to the finders? Do you license or purchase information with your community in mind? Do you help people clarify their questions their information needs? Do you show people how to find the information they need among all the other information out there?

11180695,0,t1_deza84d,gt I feel if you shouldnt have to move to do a teaching degree you shouldnt have to move to do a MLIS since both are needed resources in our communities.I think you are thinking in terms of what is fair and I am thinking in terms of what is. There are an appropriate number of accredited MLIS programs for the number of MLIS career opportunities available. There are not as many program options as there are for teachers because we need more teachers than we need librarians. Unfortunately MLIS programs are not equidistantly located across the country for students convenience and as someone who has done a lot of interviewing and hiring in the LIS field I know that I am aware of that when I consider a candidate. I expect that if there wasnt a program nearby they had to make the choice between relocating or taking classes online and if they chose online that is illuminating in a negative way especially if their resume doesnt indicate that they chose online so that they could continue working. I think that for very competitive positions in any field it is desirable for a candidate to have gone to a top notch program like yours at UW. And in most hiring managers minds whether a program is completely online factors into how top notch that program is. I was hiring in southern California. Tons of candidates with online degrees mainly SJSU. The ones who went to oncampus schools with decent or better reputations would typically get the jobs over SJSU candidates. No longer in soCal but will also offer this tidbit when I interviewed for my graduate program I asked the chair who was interviewing me someone who has been a librarian in the field for decades what she thought the advantages to attending inperson rather than online were. She was so baffled that I thought I had offended her into denying my admission. That I would even suggest online programs could compare genuinely confused her. These are the people wholl be interviewing new MLIS grads. Note I dont mean to be a jerk in saying any of this. I just have enough expertise here to really assert my viewpoint because I really think its helpful information. This field is full of great people.,librarians,dezbi47,2,t5_2qpf2
