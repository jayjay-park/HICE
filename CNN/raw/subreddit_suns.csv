I have no issue with seeing how well this current squad can do. Were in a great position to attract some big talent dont think we should force the issue and acquire just anybody.

I experienced  two divorces at a young age lived in huge houses as well as small shitty houses experienced both splendor and squalor moved a lot and tried my best to cope. But my parents were always loving despite hating each other. So I turned out fairly normal.

1034075,0,t1_chlocnw,Im not sure why you think the chances are most likely to have someone regress Dragic has been playing solid basketball enough to make him a star for the entire second half of the season. Markief Morris became a consistent player throughout the year and Green has been fantastic. Sure nobody is a secret but I dont think anyone was a secret more than two weeks into last season either.I do understand how our cap space is going to be limited and I will make an amendment to my previous statement get rid of Okafor. There is absolutely no reason to have our highest payed player payed almost double what the next in line is to be sitting on the bench. There are no guarantees for him being any good even if he is able to play and that can clear needed cap space. Besides if we get rid of these guys and pick up someone with an even higher salary how are we helping our cap space at all?The Suns have a poor history of trying to get a quick fix rather than taking a good team and sticking it out several seasons we have tried to trade and get bigger names Shaq? Carter? ONeal? that ended up being a wash. If we would stick with a young talent allow them to feel each other out and work together I think we could have a more than reasonable shot. Plumlee has the potential to be a great big man with his athleticism Dragic is already on his way to being a star Greens game has become much more wellrounded and is working on consistency and the Morris twins have done nothing but improve while playing together here.Not that I am trying to dismiss your opinions they are valid and I can understand where you are coming from.

LeBron always takes care of his guys and hes basically the GM of that team right now so dont rule this out. What I doubt is that it will be at the price of Kyrie.

Bledsoe still has star potential but the Morris brothers barely move the needle when you compare them to players at their positions in the West. Besides Bledsoe Len and maybe Warren the cupboard is pretty bare. Once Dragic was traded the script flipped back into rebuilding mode.

His incorrect assumptions lead him to insult me and snub part of the fan base for no reason. Your above reply is guilty of the same fallacy.  I would also trade every win for  ring not that it was relevant to the OP.  When you ASSume you  Im hiding behind nothing I dished out nothing.

5194673,0,t1_cvbhhlm,Maybe the main reason for the Suns pushing the  PG system is actually the fact that Eric cant effectively run the team by himself. At least not well enough to be a top  team in the West.Ive suspected this for a long time and believe this was the main reason McD didnt trade Dragic before the  season and brought in Knight after the tradegeddon. Eric obviously needs another capable ball handler in the backcourt with him.Eric is a tweener who makes too many mistakes to run the team by himself but his defense and allaround game is good enough to offset his offensive mistakes so the best way to use him is to pair him with another PG.I really dont think that Knight  Bledsoe backcourt is a tandem that will stay together for a long time.

Portlands first rounder this offseason? Probably going to be in the  range it seems a bit light to me. I really cant see Boston making a deal they just gave Horford big money. Also Im not sure what Golden State would trade either.The good news is that the teams you mentioned will be capped out this summer Boston could have space but I would be shocked if they signed Len to an offer sheet the summer after signing Horford. In fact if you look around the league most teams with money to spend this summer are set at the center position hoping Brooklyn doesnt trade Brook Lopez.The Suns arent in a position to simply give away young talent even if that talent has some work to do. If a decent trade comes along Im all for it. However theres no reason for this team to get desperate. The front office has shown that theyre not afraid to negotiate in restricted free agency and if no other team wants to step up and make a real trade offer then the Suns should try to sign Len in the offseason.,suns,daxkyx0,3,t5_2szvb

No one was saying hes actually WORTH a st rounder its just that when you go into trade negotiations you should always aim high. Why would McD go into a deal and be like yeah man we just want a low nd or something and hes yours no biggie.  McD tried to maximize his value as much as possible couldnt get the st rounder and took the best deal he could. There was no fleecing whatsoever.Its a solid trade. It doesnt hurt the Suns because were trash anyway and he doesnt match our timeline in the grand scheme of it all. Those nd rounders are lottery tickets that could bust completely or give us a fraction of a percent of a chance to land a nice role player for our future playoff squad.

New York Knicks  Joakim NoahKristaps PorzingisWillie Hernangomez Philadelphia ers Joel Embiid Toronto Raptors Serge IbakaJonas Valanciunas Chicago Bulls Robin Lopez Cleveland Cavaliers Couldnt sign a FA if they wanted to.

Its an order of operations thing for them but I suspect theyd rather resign Javale McGee. They have four guys under contract next year they have some work to do before considering Len. Los Angeles Clippers DeAndre Jordan Los Angeles Lakers Mozgov? But almost certainly not interested in adding money .M next year cap at M.  Sacramento Kings Skal Labissiere Kousta Koufos Willey Cauley Stein Georgios Papagiannis. Dallas Mavericks Nerlens Noel Houston Rockets Clint Capela Memphis Grizzlies Marc Gasol New Orleans Hornets DeMarcus CousinsIf they wanted a nooffense C Omer Asik San Antonio Spurs Pau GasolMost of those teams arent expected to have cap space either So we have two EDIT three places BrooklynBostonNew Jersey that will realistically look at Alex Len. Theres also the factor of who else is out there. These players are not necessarily better than Len but theyre not too far off either. FAplayer option Dewayne Dedmon Paul Millsap probably not to play C though Roy Hibbert Mason Plumlee Javale McGee Amir Johnson Joffrey Laveurgne Alan Williams Andrew Bogut Boris Diaw probably waived?
