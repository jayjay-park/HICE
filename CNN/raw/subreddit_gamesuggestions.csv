1430714,0,t3_2a0rr5,I wouldnt call it badass but Red Dead Redemption is fun great environment and some tense gameplay at times. Also some coop borderlands  can be pretty great fun.   ,gamesuggestions,civm7rn,1,t5_2w6uk
1601979,0,t3_2cmp3o,Banished is good. It isnt necessarily a city building game but more of a village building game. The premise is a couple of settlers from a old timey village got  banished and have to build their own village up and survive. If you want more of a citycentric building game theres cities xl which is kind of like Sim city but a beautifully rendered d version that you can literally walk around the city youre building.,gamesuggestions,cjh3k1f,1,t5_2w6uk
3006287,0,t1_co9dp6g,I was going to give you shit for this because I thought it sounded like a sports game and personally I hate sports games. But I looked it up to be sure and this looks like the most insanely crazy game Ive ever seen. I cant quite believe what Im seeing and I cant believe Ive never heard of this. ,gamesuggestions,co9lle3,1,t5_2w6uk
4173255,0,t3_37zdjt,There is a horror survival game called The Forest kind of violent but there are no guns and stuff.There is also one about dinosaurs ARK Survival Evolved but I recommend waiting a bit because it is still in early access.There is always minecraft to fall back on do a hardcore playthrough highest difficulty and cant die. After that you could mod it which is also really fun.,gamesuggestions,crvyi8d,2,t5_2w6uk
