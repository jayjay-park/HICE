1341259,0,t1_cik7f6s,Try to stay away from toys stuffed with cotton. Itll get torn up before you know it and you dont want your pup swallowing it. Rope toys are good nylabones road kill toys are good too because they dont have stuffing. ,Boxers,ciki9mb,2,t5_2t0fn

3833421,0,t3_3487bw,Mine is like this. He would be sitting on my lap lying on top of me all the time if he was allowed. He always wants to be near me. I had to curb it though as I think this constant dependence on me has contributed significantly to his separation anxiety. He now sleeps in another room and has become a fair bit more independent he will go and sleep in the other room now in his crate whereas before he would have to be beside me at all times. Dont get my wrong I love his cuddles and being around him but he was super needy and it was doing him no good as he couldnt cope when I wasnt around even if someone else was with him. We have nowhere near fixed the issue and I honestly doubt we ever will completely but he is doing much better. I was actually seriously considering rehoming before we started to make some progress. ,Boxers,cqt8rr5,2,t5_2t0fn

8236079,0,t3_4s5myb,Damage is done if there is any. Talk to your vet when you can tomorrow. You did towel dry the pup right? Any flea treatment will be oily and soap helps but friction rubbing with a towel is best to remove any oil. Dont overdo it. And I hope your pupprs is fine. ,Boxers,d572cz6,2,t5_2t0fn
