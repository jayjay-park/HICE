7258507,0,t1_d232hlu,Thats the way it happens but Im glad that action will be taken to get her and at least all the female kittens spayed. Ive come to think of it this way...If an unfixed female cat goes out into the world an unknown number of cats into an unknown number of years in the future could result from that unspayed cat. It could be less than  it could be over a thousand. If the cat is spayed that cat only equals one cat. My husband and I joke that unspayed cats are open portals into the kitten universe where kittens come flooding through if you dont close them no world doesnt know what to do with all these beautiful exotic sensitive fragile animals... What were seeing now is the results of that flood ...so you have to close the portals otherwise there are kitten leaks all over the place!,jellybeantoes,d238ogf,1,t5_35mcy

9295527,0,t1_d8u41yv,He is though. He wants to be outside but he doesnt know that other feral cats have FIV and a thousand other diseases that could kill him or that theres any number of other wild animals especially in a rural area that could kill him without diseases or that his hunting could be hurting the ecology of the area. It being a rural area it might not be as big of a deal there for the ecology because theres more wildlife and in theory less cats but still. The danger to your cat specifically cant be handwaved away. And this isnt even taking into account the chances of being hit by a car which are less in a rural area but not zero.Your cat is stupid. All cats are stupid. They go on instinct rather than knowledge because theyre animals. They cant foresee and prevent their own untimely deaths but you can.,jellybeantoes,d8u9wed,2,t5_35mcy
