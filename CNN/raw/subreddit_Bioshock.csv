405138,0,t3_1ypknq,BioShock  is one of my favourite games. Some time after it came out I saw it was getting spit on and dismissed but I didnt really pay attention to that. I got it and went in unbiased. I dont want to compare it to the others in terms of which I think is best because I love them all separately and as a whole but it does some things better than the other two titles. What I can say is I think  had the best combat out of the games because there were so many possibilities especially with the dualwielding and the plasmid trap combos. Thats not to say I think the combat in  or Infinite wasnt good in fact I liked it in both games although less in Infinite. Of course the latter had a variety of Vigor and weapon combos as well but not nearly as big as .  BioShock  also improved on many mechanics like the Camera plasmid use hacking as well as the visuals and more. However what I most love about it is the bond I felt with Eleanor and how my actions actually changed her character and demeanor. I really wanted to help her I wanted her to be safe. And seeing the statues of me rescuing the NPCs through the Little Sisters eyes really made me emotional as did the whole Little Sister adoption and subsequent saving mechanics. It was so touching to see how playing a merciful forgiving Delta changed how the NPCs reacted to you and pretty much established you as the most human character in the game even though you were as Sinclaire roughly put it a tin man. And who can forget the Big Sister fights? They were the ultimate test for your skills weapons plasmids. And the ending monologue Eleanor does for the best ending as well as that pan of Rapture with the main theme of the first game and her saying And then Father the Rapture dream was over. Man. I teared up.. The Ocean On His Shoulders. How fitting..  I really like Lamb as a villain as well because she was so different yet almost as welldesigned as Andrew Ryan in some aspects.    I was invested all the way throughout BioShock  as I was with  and Infinite. I went in without prejudice and I got one hell of a good game out of it.     To this day I wonder what happened to Eleanor the Little Sisters and Lamb after the end...,Bioshock,cfmrbqh,4,t5_2shl2

537169,0,t1_cg19mbi,gt  I guess we just never explored the areas of Rapture where these things were present?I might be wrong but I was under the impression that the events of Bioshock and Bioshock  had already transpired and Comstock was placed into Rapture at an earlier point in Rapture Primes timeline. Thus Elizabeth followed him there opening tears through which Suchong saw the vigors and such as explained through the voxophones. In other words the tears occur across space and time which we know because of the ending of Bioshock Infinite. Burial at Sea takes place in Rapture prime but its timeline has been altered from what it was in Bioshock and Bioshock . By this theory if we were to play a version of Bioshock that took place in the altered timeline Rapture would have vigors and pneumo lines.There was an article I read a while back about Burial at Sea in which Ken Levine quoted Einstein The only reason for time is so that everything doesnt happen at once. I figured this was a hint toward the idea that Infinite takes place in  and Bioshock in  but only in their respective timelines. In reality their timelines are independent of when the events actually occur in relation to each other. Just a thought anyway.,Bioshock,cg1c031,1,t5_2shl2

655668,0,t3_21mg5u,So youre saying that pastversions of Columbia still exist up until the point the siphon is destroyed?How? Its not the siphon being destroyed that erases Columbia its Bookers drowning at the baptism which occurs before Columbia is built. All the siphon being destroyed accomplishes is giving Liz her full abilities. This completely goes against the whole goal of making it so he never even lived in the first place. Even so what does this mean for the original after credits scene then? I assumed that scene was to show that now that all Comstock universes have been erased Bookers universe resets to the point just before Comstock has any transdimensional influence which is the day that Robert comes to offer to buy Anna as shown by the date on his desk. If what youre saying is true then either that after credits scene is something completely different or the after credits universe will still involve Comstock taking Anna only the universe he takes her too will eventually be erased from existence making that happy ending completely pointless.How do you know that the multiverse in its entirety runs on its own timeline? This seems to contradict everything the Luteces said about how time works and how from the perspective of someone outside of a certain universe everything that will ever happen has already happened.Erasing universes from existence should be absolute once you allow the possibility of it to exist in some way then it opens the door for Bookers sacrifice to be rendered pointless. I know Infinites idea of a multiverse has always been kind of shaky but in Infinite it was some what left open to interpretation which made it a lot easier to swallow.

763015,0,t1_cgqw1z2,Well the developers have alluded to her being the only Elizabeth left. Another detail of quantum physics is that the particle which is in a state of superposition exists theoretically in all POSSIBLE worlds but not all worlds practically. Not all possibilities are even of the same probability.   Elizabeth having knowledge of all possibilities doesnt necessarily mean she has actualized them all especially considering she seems to mirror a particle in superposition. She just knows what the possibilities are.What follows is probably a very small number of actualized realities. Many of the ones that the Luteces and Comstock created were likely similar to their own and would have collapsed at the drowning. This would allow for the single Comstock to exist in Rapture. The game seems to tell us that the Comstock who accidentally decapitated Anna wanted to go somewhere to hide i.e. somewhere VERY different. This could imply that there arent many very different actualized realities that didnt collapse. ,Bioshock,cgr0ecx,1,t5_2shl2

It continues the story somewhat though its obvious that it would have liked  to not have such a decisive end so it could continue the same story.

890098,0,t3_24as9w,. Youre right theres an obvious plothole if we assume Elizabeth drowning DeWitt at the end of Infinite is the actual purge of DeWitts future. She would have had to travel back in time to drown the actual prebaptism DeWitt rather than a version which has already lived through those events. Since the writers dropped the ball you have to assume  she went back in time later to kill the actual prebaptism DeWitt and her killing of Infinites DeWitt was simply her letting DeWitt know the truth before snuffing him out. . The outcome of the coin toss is understood to be a constant always landing on heads. DeWitt sometimes chooses tails instead but it always lands heads. Its a minor distinction but important as it helps cements the idea of constants and variables different choice same outcome.The multiple universe rules in Infinite arent really explained so everyone seems to have their theories about how they work. To me it boils down Elizabeths wish fulfillment when she opens tears. Elizabeths tears conform to the outcome she wants ChenLi is alive ChenLis tools were never taken etc but the chain of events leading to that outcome can vary wildly with huge implications. This leads to the really interesting question do the multiple universes in Bioshock Infinite exist because Elizabeth creates them or is she just opening doors to universes that are already there? Theres more to this but I dont want to spoil the DLC for you.,Bioshock,ch5gi3f,4,t5_2shl2

914900,0,t1_ch88u2p,I understand the idea that it was an attempt to erase all possibilities of Comstock and Columbia.What is still confusing to me is that Booker prime was drowned.  This Booker never chose to be baptized he is the one who had Anna taken from him.Booker prime never chose to be baptized so what does drowning him solve?  Him rejecting the baptism which he rejected again at the end of the game eventually lead to him meeting Annas mother and conceiving Anna.  This leads the version of him that DID accept the baptism to become Comstock and to try to steal Booker primes daughter because he never was able to have one.Taking him back in time to the moment when he was drowned would mean there would be another Booker there awaiting baptism.  This is the one they should drown  Unless the idea of the doors is that it is jumping through time as opposed to universes.  If that is the case it leads back to my initial question of what ever technically happened to Booker prime?  I understand that the critical moment is a variable on whether or not he chooses to be baptized but this version of him that we are playing as would never allow himself to become Comstock given everything he has experienced during the game......Sigh actually I think I just figured it out and understand now.  Even though we are to assume that Booker prime would never chose to be Comstock the potential is always there.  So that is why she drowns him to ensure that it NEVER happens no matter what.  I think what was tripping me up was the doors not being the same as tears.  The doors represent more of the passage of time and the points where universes branch off.Huh seeing it that way makes the ending even more tragic.  The idea that you think you would never choose something so terrible but Elizabeth standing in front of you is living proof that you sometimes do even when you know everything that you currently do.,Bioshock,ch8a3kt,1,t5_2shl2

This is why he is confused about his past what year he came to Rapture why everyone including himself and the player thinks he is actually Booker DeWitt he is not anymore he has been baptized as Comstock. This is why Elizabeth has him run the whole gauntlet again with Sally instead of Anna so he could remember what hes done and understand that killing him is punishment for that. Basically revengejustice. Comstock is doomed to chase after Sally because there are constants and variables there is always a man always a girl NO MATTER THE UNIVERSE.

1660479,0,t3_2dal6u,A large theme in the game is the theory of constants and variables which assumes that in a multiworld scenario there are certain events that are always constant in every world and there are other things that are variables and can be changed. For example the coin toss. Of the  previous Bookers theyve tried to help every single one of them has turned up heads. But when presented with the two pendants for Elizabeth they always voice mild surprise at the choice an instance of variance between universes. Again at the ticket counter where you are given the option to draw or demand tickets your choice ultimately doesnt matter because the following events unfold regardless. Constants and variables. The game itself can be seen as a constant. For every Bioshock released thus far there is always a man a lighthouse and a city. A constant. The man the lighthouse and the city are all variables to the constant. One of the first constants introduced in the game is the fact that Booker doesnt row. In any world thus far anyways. ,Bioshock,cjogs7n,2,t5_2shl2

2354707,0,t1_cm2qubn,The reason why the Comstock in BASEP didnt get purged was because his timeline veered off from the typical Comstock course. Instead of retrieving Anna from Booker he killed her in the process. Remember quantum mechanics in Infinite says there must be constants and variables and this was one of the variables that Elizabeth never expected. When she purged the timeline of Comstocks only the Comstocks that had retrieved Anna through the tear were affected.In BASEp Elizabeth has lost all of her abilities to travel through dimensionstears. However remember in Infinite when she fully unlocked her powers by destroying her statue. From there she was able to see EVERYTHING the past the future the present etc. She opened all the doors this is why in EP she was able to remember what she did albeit only brief snippets. Notice how in her dream of Paris you see references to what happens later in the story the Lobotomy sign the ace of spades card referring to the Ace in the hole. These were a result of her mind putting her memories together but it cant make any sense of it. The mind of the subject wil struggle to create memories where none exist.

In particular Im thinking of Cohen Fink and Lady Comstock. I know that Cohen was technically helping you but his temper and personality couldve been utilized better to stand in Jacks way. He seems like the type who would purposely destroy Frolic just to spite you if he really wanted. Fink was just an awful person in general and I think was better at Comstocks role than Comstock was Comstock was in a way. As for Lady Comstock.... I liked the fact that Booker was fighting himself Comstock and wouldve liked it for Liz to have more conflict with Lady Comstock seeing as shes a manifestation of Lizs hate for her. ,Bioshock,cmpf955,2,t5_2shl2

I always took that and his whole prophecy thing to mean he was jumping tears and witnessing future events so he could report back on them but these jumps could have been longer on one side than the other. We already know from BaS that time jumps are possible and that other Columbias existed.Basically I think he ran around longer in tears than initially thought and that while he is the same age as Booker for his time stream hes been running around for years in other time streams and coming back to the same point in time in his own.,Bioshock,cmstg04,2,t5_2shl2

When he travels to the alternate Columbia partway through the game Booker is already dead in this world.  Comstock also exists in this world but hes more or less the same guy in both Columbias so I guess whatever mental discord there is between Booker and Comstock was already delt with the first time.

Linus Tech Tips forum has a great threadarticle describing how to overclock a monitor.Finally SweetFX has allowed me to enable fake HDR remove the bluegrey tint raise the exposure a little and sharpen the textures. I also added some film grain because I think it adds to the experience remember this is set in the s.And OH MY RYAN does it look good. Ill have to grab some screen shots that should at least do the visuals some justice  but that wont do the butter smooth  FPSHz justice.,Bioshock,cpcswi4,3,t5_2shl2

3730742,0,t3_334oxl,Ill do my best to answer but it might not be that goodTime travel Its not really time travel but instead just bringing Booker into a dimension in which time either moves a little fasterslower or the universe began a little bit earlierlater than our own so Booker never time travels in a single universe.Infinite Comstocks This was a question Ive been struggling with for a while and Ive made a theory that I think satisfies it Packets. Youve probably heard about how that scene near the beginning where the Luteces make Booker flip a coin and its the rd I think heads on the board. That shows that Booker has tried and failed  again I think thats the number correct me if Im wrong times to save Elizabeth. This also brings up the neat little thing that whenever Booker dies because of gameplay and Elizabeths not around instead of simply respawning you show up in Bookers office with the tear black and white film grain filter. This implies that you didnt simply respawn but you are now a different version of Booker from a different universe. The office tear also happens at scripted times in the story such as when the priests baptizes you when entering Columbia or when Songbird throws you into what you think to be the ocean but turns out to be Battleship Bays waters. This would infer that actually that the priest drowns you and that you indeed did fall into the ocean and die but then the next Bookers succeeded in avoiding these outcomes. Im getting a little off topic here. The point is that my Packests theory would say that for every  universes the plus being for every time you die after the Luteces do their little coin stunt Booker finally beats Comstock saves Liz then Liz does her speech and kills Booker. That  universes we see in the game in fact happen for every  universe packet. That means theres not only two of the Godly Luteces one free Elizabeth and one dead baptism Booker but infinite one for every packet because as we know infinite divided by  or  is still infinite. This is further supported by the Burial at Sea DLC when HOLY FUCKSHIT DONT LOOK AT THIS IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED BURIAL AT SEA CUZ ITS AWESOME Elizabeth says the Comstock that she kills at the end of episode  is the Last Comstock. As youve said there cannot be a Last Comstock if there are infinite numbers of Comstocks. Elizabeth simply means the last Comstock out of her packet and she knows the other Elizabeths from the other packets are handling their Last Comstockspoiler So to end the theory in the last scene of the game where the Elizabeths start disappearing they dont disappear one at a time because of that one Booker dying they disappear because Elizabeth starts to take out Comstocks one at a time in her packet.The Video The Baptism While yes the game says that there are constants and variables making it impossible for there to be a universe where Booker doesnt go to the baptism anything beforeafter it is fair game. As long as events lead Booker to that baptism its alright. This means that before the baptism Booker didnt have to be the good hearted all race loving guy we see in the game. In universes where Booker becomes Comstock he most likely already was a racist selfish prick and the baptism just sort of happens. Thats why Elizabeth can love Booker and hate Comstock.The Video the Luteces While yes Rosalinds technology was what created the city it really wasnt up to them who would run it. Columbia doesnt exist in Bookers universe which is why he says How come Ive never heard of it? Columbia is revealed in promotional videos to be a mobile middlefinger to other countries of the world that was promoted by the U.S. government. Comstock was just at the right place at the right time and it didnt hurt that the people supported him and his radical conservative views as a prophet. In the end no of course the Luteces probably didnt believe Comstock or agree with his views but would they really care? As long as they be doin science they be aight. The Video Comstocks name Alright you got me there. I dont know enough about the ChristianCatholic religion to know of a name like Comstock but I think thats more of a continuity error than a plot hole.Sidenote The drawings in the video are fucking awesome and Id pay for one.I really hoped that helped. Like I said before you should definitely play Burial at Sea if you havent unless you havent played the original Bioshock first in which case DO IT NOW as it wouldnt make much sense.

Scott Sinclare took over after Nate Wells left and from Sinclares blog he mentioned the mechanics for an earlier level build was too problematic in testing those physics with moving buildings. Gavin Goulden mentioned that most of the characters were changed because they didnt fit in with the erahalf of the clothed models were removed because they were just ambiguous era looking and that their procedural heads were originally meant to look like Political Cartoons with model attachements for their hair and mustaches but look too unnatural too unconformed for procedural generation and unintentionally Splicerish to consider them as normal citizens.

5420462,0,t1_cw4i5jl,I dont either. But again most remasters have not refined the core gameplay or anything of the sort. Well originally they did. But now we have all kinds of unnecessary remasters and definitive editions which is essentially just the game and the DLC with the settings cranked up a little more. Then at the bottom end of the scale we have something like Dishonored Definitive Edition which looks basically the same and still runs at  fps even though my  year old laptop runs it maxed out  frames. The closest thing to a remastered collection like what we want from BioShock is probably Borderlands Handsome Edition which upd the resolution and fps while adding up to  player couch coop instead of just . But it didnt have any tweaks or mechanics changed and only includes BL and the PreSequel. This indicates they either think that BL is irrelevant or having all  would be too much content for  D so they dropped the first one or idk multiple disks is too much money as they cant expect everyone to digital download unlikely. This remastered collection might even drop Infinite from the collection for such reasons and give you a download code for a normal copy of Infinite.,Bioshock,cw4irzo,1,t5_2shl2

5938259,0,t1_cxxwwb5,I like this idea the best. I think having the show format lets you cover a larger amount of material and Bioshock has so much going on thematically that would be necessary to make it right.  Specifically HBO would allow for the dark reality of rapture to be shown. If it were portrayed on a pg kind of platform it wouldnt be able to have the depth Bioshock does. There have been a few series recently done pretty well with a gritty tv show version like Gothamdaredevil. Something in this vein would be better than a movie in my opinion. EditNow that Ive begun to think about it I would love to see it formatted to begin in rapture precivil war introduce characters and then kind of give them their own episode of background to show their beginnings and how they ended up in rapture. Bill Ryan sander Fontaine and tenembaum would all be so much fun to see developed further like in the book. Then show where things have gone and finish the first season with the New Years party. Season  could document the decent of rapture and retell how the characters have changed by slipping into madness or changing morality like Brigid. ,Bioshock,cxy1ba8,12,t5_2shl2

While it did sound neat their testing made sense that it wouldnt work for a lot of players during gameplay in the same way as a Shock Jockey enemy would be difficult to catch and cause too much damage on you and every surrounding enemySlate has this feature when you noclip to him in the Crescendo arenadie by dropping off the area and respawn with him on the ground where hell sprint around toss SJ all over the area hitting you and killing his own men and if you kill him he has no loot.. They settled on BoS to be a security alarm since his announcement because since then I havent heard or found anything else further about him for the finished product that says he would do more than just listen to player sounds and alerting enemiesand most of the walking around has been mostly from fans not from any further articles. ,Bioshock,cy4odiz,3,t5_2shl2

9093468,0,t1_d84pail,gt You do meet those people again if you save them. Play the game again.Maybe I didnt write clearly enough I meant that it wouldve been better if they had been better utilized to either be corpses which would have shown the brutal nature of Columbia or an account from them on how hard it has been to have their relationship. As it is in the current form of the game they dont do anything meaningful.  If I remember correctly all they do is say Thanks and Fitzroy said thered be someone like you and then you get some gear as a reward for not throwing the baseball at them and off you go. It felt like wasted potential. gt The Mormons are fine with blood transfusions its the Jehovahs Witnesses who are against it. Ah ok then my bad has been a bit of a long day took a stab at the name and got it wronggt so Im not sure what youre trying to proveI wasnt trying to prove anything about Jehovahs Witnesses it was more an example of the fact that religious people view the body as a perfect temple something made in Gods image something that should not be changed by mans own hands. Things such as modern day mechanical limbs grafted on peoples bodies are protested and detested by religious people because they believe its not right. That was the angle that I was getting at that religious people based on events that can be seen right now do not tolerate people tinkering with their own bodies. Its why I am very skeptical of Handymen being seen with awe. gt Columbia wasnt founded by an extreme religious minorityColumbia was founded by a Christian zealot. Zachary Hale Comstock self titles himself The Prophet or Father Comstock. He identifies as a Christian and believes very strongly in the JudeoChristian god. He is a minority of the Christian faith because he believes he has visions and prophecys about the future bequeathed to him by an angel called Columbia from God himself and believes himself a prophet of god. He believes that Columbia the city is the true America and that one day America will burn and only Columbia will remain. It is because of this that he developed a small cult of pseudo protestant christians and it was this cult that followed him to Columbia. This small cult would go on to develop The Founders a major political and citizen faction. In other words the people that followed him to Columbia and founded it were a group of minority religious extremists. The next wave of people that follow Comstock to Columbia Im assuming also believe that Comstock is a prophet of God and follow his word and beliefs to the letter. Im assuming the baptism at the start of the game is people being reborn into this new sect of Christianity where Comstock is their prophet shepherd leader and not just a regular baptism. Remember you cannot enter Columbia without being baptized. There is no way to circumvent this. If you enter Columbia you accept that Comstock is the prophet of God and accept his rules and beliefs. Everyone who enters Columbia is a religeous extremist just like Comstock and The Founders.gt and its highly likely it was filled with scientists and other learned individuals given its original mission as a floating Worlds Fair of sorts.We know it had scientists on board it had the Lutece twins onboard and all the other scientists who gave it the ability of flight. Just being a scientist doesnt stop you from being religious though. One aspect does not counteract another. I know that people like to think that being a scientist means being logical cold and calculating but you can still be religeous and a scientist engineer or doctor. gt I think your issue is with religion itself and you feeling Infinite doesnt critique it enough is based on your own failings not the games.Unfortunately thats just a presumption. I have no issue with religion. I do not buy games and then get all pissy because they do not critique religion. I didnt buy Hotline Miami or The Last of Us and expect them to shit all over religion. BioShock Infinite brought up specific themes and ideas and then didnt have the balls to follow through with it. And thats the issue I have with it. Although Ive spoken a lot about religion its not actually about religion its about misuse of themes and underutilizing themes presented within a piece of work. Its my biggest gripe about media when it sets up an expectation and then falls short of that expectation because its lazy sloppy writing which Infinite is full of which answers the question of this thread actually. To put it into perspective of what I expected BioShock Infinite to tackle because of what it talks about I expected it to be heavily critical of religious fanaticism and extremism because we are told that Comstock took advantage of a group of easily impressionable people with his fancy parlor tricks and corrupted them and turned them into a group of evil horrible people who ruins the lives of others without a second thought. The game should have tackled this directly by showing just how shitty it is to blindly follow a person their beliefs and their orders without a second thought for who it hurts or tackle the idea of people who use religion as a crux to attack others. But instead were no better because we invade this foreign land and slaughter wave after wave of our fellow man without giving a flying fuck because of a note that says Bring us the Girl. There is no real interaction with the people of Columbia. There is no attempt at trying to make The Founders or Comstock sympathetic. There is no attempt at showing us how extreme nationalism is totally fucked up besides some small scenes that Ive seen kids books do better. BioShock  didnt shy away from its themes it confronted all of them directly. We get to see and interact with the shitty people in BioShock  see exactly why they were doing the shitty things they did maybe even sympathize with them but ultimately condemn them. I get exactly why Steinman became what he is absolutely no restrictions upon his work allowed himself to to cut anyone he pleased ruining their faces bodies and lives. Thats one single person in BioShock . A single person we see in a single level and yet we see all we need to see in that single level. We hear through audio tapes the lives hes fucked up we see in the level itself the blood the corpses the horror. We see in the boss fight itself the surgery tables hanging from the ceiling with mutilated corpses that he worked on. We understand exactly what happened and how it happened and the horrible repercussions. Levine used Steinman to explore the themes of Libertarians and Medicine perfectly. BioShock Infinite didnt do any of that it danced around its themes and never did anything meaningful with them. Like did we get anything close to that with the Fraternal Order of the Ravens? They were a group of people who were dedicated solely to enforcing the racial hierarchy. Did we ever get to see any of the personal acts they committed in order to enforce their Racial Purity goal? No. We encounter the Fraternal Order of Ravens a few times but every single time theyre a non entity. Faceless. Boring. The idea of a super powered group dedicated solely to racism is interesting but then its totally misused. They could have even been the group that punished the white man and black women for being in a relationship in order to show to the player how fucked up they are and what theyll do to enforce their Whites are better than blacks policy.With that Im done for the night sorry but its three in the morning here so if you do reply itll be a while before I am able to respond so good night and have a good day. ,Bioshock,d84w0ek,0,t5_2shl2

9869749,1,t1_datzd9c,Infinite is definitely less cliche in execution and storytelling than SOMA.I dont find SOMA refreshing at all. It was rather tired in its tropes and the ending was predictable as well.  The characters didnt do it for me either. Above all the themes were the usual ones found in a scifi story.  SOMA didnt do anything that hasnt been done before.  Looking at the MGS series alone will provide most of the aspects of SOMA while the Shock series gives the rest.But then I also hate Naughty Dog games as I consider them poorly written and not at all something one should be inspired or influenced by.Edit Would someone actually care to explain what was so amazing about SOMA or are you just pissed that I spoke the truth?,Bioshock,dau1una,0,t5_2shl2
