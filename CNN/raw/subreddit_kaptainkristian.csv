Not only did I start my internet life there but every community I am a part of now stemmed from some animation some game from Newgrounds. I have a few audio submissions that are still there. None of my animations were really very good But I remember Newgrounds always being the Home Land. Great Topic.Great Essay.Great Video.I watched your first video about a day after it came out and I still love to see an alert from your channel.Thanks for the content.,kaptainkristian,dfnrx9y,5,t5_3ejwo
