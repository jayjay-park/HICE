If the enemy have  armor you need  AD before flat armor pen becomes efficient.Dont quote me on the numbers but that is how I got this explained to me. Basically flat armor pen is only worth against low armor targets like the enemy carries which is why you often rush brutalizer on assassins when people still have low armor.

If you get  creeps which is not that much you get  mana back. Your native MP is  at level  so you get  mana additionally. With  mana per minute you can almost spam oranges on CD without running oom.

63219,0,t3_1utulp,Pretty much yes you just take the CS hit. One good roam after  can recover your lane.You start with Flask   pots and just focus on getting as much experience as you can and as much last hits as you can without being punished for it too hard. If you have to eat a Ziggs Q for a CS dont go for it. Maybe get it with a safe Q or just let it drop and go for the safe ones when his Q is down or dodgable.I dont bother maxing Q anymore in rough lanes. Its better for trading but you cant trade against the likes of Ziggs and Ori anyway theyre too far away and taking their auto attacks for an extended time ruins you. Instead I max E so that I can AoE all the CS when I get pushed in and so that at level  I can clear waves decently fast so I can go roam. Obviously you get W at level  to last hit under tower.As soon as you hit  even if youre  CS behind as long as youre not zoned from XP and can get a Tear and maybe one or two dorans rings on the way you can function. Get one or two good roams off to get  kills and youre back in the game.Dont get  utility unless its an easy lane get  in defense or  if youre really scared say vs. Riven.

74374,0,t1_cemv0zj,Movespeed Janna is so trolly. Ive played against more than a few Jannas who did a spectacular job of being a huge nuisance drawing attention and then being impossible to chase down with Zephyr presumably Utility masteries and MS quints  boots and Howling Gale on top of that. And someone would always take the bait and try to chase her down instead of focusing on objectives.Its a bit of a pointless gimmick... except that with a little AP Janna can waveclear very well with Howling Gale. This allows her to shut down pushes and potentially splitpush on her own. Add in a Lich Bane and she has even more MS plus incredible damage against towers making her a real splitpush threat.IMO support Jannas biggest weakness is her lack of aggressive lane presence due to her low attack range  and tendency to hold Gale for counteraggression. MS quints make sense on her to let you dart in and out to more easily harass with autos and Zephyr. Id be choosing between MS . MS flat health  and flat AP  quints.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cemwal6,3,t5_2smhl

I was thinking that itd be very interesting if they could rework his E in such a way that it extended the time he could hold one of his W cards lowers early game pressure and makes him similarly vulnerable to how he is now and what if it somehow could proc for extra damage on his Q like a spell crit or something.

His ability to kite as a bruiser and also buff his team while being very tanky or very fast is a massive boon that can win late game teamfights on its own. Its a free ZekesMiniTalisman on a  second CD late game how would that not help your team?gt  Fitting into any team sounds cool but thats something you would do when you dont have a better choiceI find that ludicrous you wont fit yourself into your teams comp unless youre forced to? That is a weird thing to say. GP can be more valuable because he can adapt his build better than many characters. Trundle cant help a mid lane AP carry do their job better because he cant buy things like Abyssal or Wits End. GP can. Shyvana cant help her bot lane deal with that Teleport Mundo gank but GPs ult can. Nasus cant buy Executioners calling because he is melee and wont reliably get off the attacks he needs to shut down an enemy heal but GP can. Hes got multiple advantages over more optimal picks you just have to be smart about it. gt has a place in the game but Im not sure the current meta game is that place.And thats where we disagree. I think hes at least a midtier character in the current meta. Im trying to prove that and Ill keep shooting for diamond in my attempt to prove people like you wrong.

442224,0,t1_cfqi8f7,gtAs a heads up APC refers to the role of a mid laner who is going for damage. Mid laners that go bot lane do not go there because they become late game gods in terms of damage see Karthus Cass etc. but because of their CC with moderate damage which allows their ADC to become a carry with a fed lane.gtAPC does not equal any AP mage see mid lane Lulu and shouldnt be used in that way. Its a specific role that requires a lot of farm and some really good ability scaling. I dont agree with this. Its rather easy to imagine an APC that would work better in a duolane rather than a sololane for much the same reasons ADCs are generally run in a duolane. If there was an APC that had poor perrank scaling on their abilities but high AP ratios it would make sense to pair them with a support. I dont know if there are currently any champions that fit this description but if there were we wouldnt start calling them ADCs just because they are being paired with a support. They would still be an APC. Like Urgot can and is run bot lane with a support but to call him an ADC would be a mistake. Just like calling midlane LeeSin an APC would be a mistake.So yeah. APCs tend to go mid but I dont think going mid is at all an intrinsic part of their role. Karthus jungle is still an APC.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cfqlnn5,1,t5_2smhl

486174,0,t3_1zo7ms,... Why is this thread downvoted? I think this is a good discussion question. Seems like every good thread that isnt about How do you build X or Is X viable are downvoted lately.Well you dont have to push to get to level  first necessarily. If you watch the enemy creeps you can simply burst down the thth minion whatever it is before the opponent can and youll still hit  slightly before them although they may hit  right after.When you want to control the wave its important to take into account whenwhere the next wave is coming and if the wave has a cannon minion wave watch what the cannon minion is hitting.Another thing to watch for is how much your opponent is autoattacking minions and how much burstpush potential they have. If they autoattack a wave  times more than you early on in the wave it can cause the wave to sorta snowball into pushing toward your side.There are a few ways to position the next wave further back or forward. Like if you zone the enemy adc or autoattack them here or there you will make them hit minions less and make the enemy minions aggro you so that theyre not attacking To make it push to your side you can try to lasthit at the absolute last sliver of health so that the enemy ADC is overall doing more damage to minions than you or you can bait the enemy into autoattacking you once. Just one autoattack can make  of your minions or so chaseaggro them for a decent amount of time and even if its only for a little bit that small health difference on the minions will snowball into pushing.Theres also good ways to control the wave by pushing the minions into the enemy turret fast enough that it resets the wave but I find that rather difficult to do sometimes. Its hard to calculate that far in advance how much time it will take the turret to down the minions or how much the enemy ADC will attack your minions before they get to the turret.Thats about all I know.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cfvj5bc,22,t5_2smhl

567992,0,t3_20hqrh,Jayce is much different from Nidalee. If we are talking about team comps. This is what Jayce would bring to the table over Nidalee.. While both Poke they have different roles in poke comps. Jayce shoves lane better than Nidalee letting you be more lenient in what champs you pick to shove the lane. In a traditional poke comp you would need someone to poke I.E Nidalee someone to shove I.E. Cailtyn Someone to hit the tower I.E AD Carry Someone for disengage I.E. Janna and thats about it. So Jayce can push while Nid cant. Jayce can hit towers for a lot of damage.

When you are at  The W is on a  second CD and it starts when you cast the spell rather than when you use your buff. So you can really fast push with Jayce. Nid can hit towers but not for the damage that Jayce does.. Late game Jayce turns into a monster second AD Carry. If you build him in a couple ways you can turn into a second AD Carry and start out putting damage higher than your AD carry if left alone.

AP ratio and not only is the base damage on his E is low its typically maxed last so youre not going to be doing much damage by building AP on Shen even if you could somehow get away with building a full AP build Deathcap etc. With that being said whats the point of the build? Are you wanting to play AP Shen for fun and wondering how to best optimize that build or are you wanting to play the best Shen build?If the latter dont go with AP its just not the most effective build path on Shen and youll be gimping yourself and your team.If the former Id go more for a Magic Pen build the way that top Elise is still sometimes played. Sorc Shoes  Haunting Guise into Sunfire gives you a good chunk of Magic Pen and you should run Hybrid Pen runes which will then also maximize the Sunfire burn. Follow Sunfire up with Wits End and then something like Randuins for pure tankiness which will otherwise be lacking. Finishing Liandrys is usually best as a th or th item and then your last item should be situational based on the enemy team comp either another MR item like Banshees or Spirit Visage or something like Thornmail if youre against a heavy AD comp.

If you want to increase Nautilus threat increase the damage on W and introduce some sort of innate CDR into the ability  impairing movement reduces titans Wrath by  second or whatever. Nautilus entire teamfight presence effectively hinges on his W being up so give him tools to do so. The biggest problem Ive had with him is that his animations are so goddamn slow.

918563,0,t3_24kmai,Decently high lp d. My honest biased on my experience this seasonFeral flare vs sotel  a good aggressive ganker like vi lee and panth who prefer the stats and early game of sotel will probably dominate the game with their pressure vs a typical ff jungler. If the enemy jungler plans on farming till  and keep farming while their team is losing all lanes its their fault they lose. Even if you dont gank as a sotel jungler counter jungling is even stronger now because each camp is worth so much more to ff junglers. This doesnt mean typical ff junglers are bad though if youre a good ff jungler like yi udyr noct and jax then farming quickly should be your priority to be useful mid to late game. The problem here is that people play these junglers while only thinking of farming when the only way you can get by only farming is if your lanes all win anyways or at the very least go even. Very rare even in d. You pretty much need to know how to countergank as a ff jungler if you plan to stay in the game and yi and nocturne are phenomenal countergankers. TLDR you gamble your lanes for lategame with feral flare. At which point you may have lost the gameXin i really dont like the influx of ff xin junglers. Hes an early game ganker who falls to shit lategame. And then people build ff and farm all game to have a mediocre lategame? Makes no sense either build sotel and gank and counterjungle a shit ton build ff and find a medium or dont play xin. Vi pretty sure everyone knows what vi does at this point. She hasnt changed. Not as popular but still damn goodYi op if nobody stops him or you dont have hard ccburst. Cleaning up counter ganks is pretty much the easiest way to get fed as yi. Lategame monster with proper alpha and meditate micro. Also easily shutdown by good counter junglers like udyr xin and shaco who can also gank well. Yi will be finishing that ff as you push their inhib turret. Nocturne farm to  and farm till counter gankall in dive with ulti. I dont really like noct but hes annoying to deal with when lategame solo queue he will jump your adc and kill them v with ease. Should probably group early against him while hes squishy. Udyr one of my favorite junglers because you can either go feral flare or sotel. Good clear good ganks good counterjungling. But he is hard to use effectively lategame as youre kited quite easily. Basically go sotel if you want to go full ham gank and counter jungle. Very good against yi and maybe jax. Feral flare for regular jungling. You can also go full tank pheonix mix or do what i do and go bork with tiger and bear only. Pretty risky but good payoffKha as explanatory as vi. Scary fucker who canpretty much build whateverEve same as above but easier to shutdown in jungle. Her ganks are pretty scary at bot lanePanth still just as strong. Still the dameLee pretty much still the same still good if youre good with him. Jax feral flare pretty much made him like a better lategame udyr. He sacrifices a lot of different things that udyr has but his damage is is stupid. He can also gank pretty well because of leap stun and can ward jump over walls. Hes probably better at top but hes like a tankier yi for lategMe jungle hypercarry. My stupid and hilariously situationaly viable jungler of the day is yasuo. If your team has good knockups like ori nami thresh etc a yasuo jungle can really complete the team comp with utility and damage idk hes fun but i dontthink he is reliable. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,ch8p30z,1,t5_2smhl

Most ad junglers are built tank after two items and have one at most defensive abilities. J Udyr Xin Lee Vi kha Panth and Wu fit into this catagory.

1102188,1,t3_26qr9i,Ive seen it done and its iffy against a strongtanky top laner with a gap closer Renekton Jax to an extent etc.Since AD Trist has an incredibly long build up time Id recommend going AP Trist. Valkrin a season  challenger player has taken her AP top before and can wreck with it. Your early magic damage really puts most top laners off their normal build path and youll be hard to gank as all get out as long as youre not shoving the lane. At level  you have amazing killing potential as a full combo should take most top laners well below half their health. If you are able to jump behind them and ult them under your turret you are practically guaranteed a kill especially since theyre building MR against you and shouldnt have much armor at this point. Also as an AP Trist you need to be roaming once you have your Frost queens claimDFG. Your midgame assassination potential is incredibly high. Youre going to want to make picks and get your team rolling especially since you dont have a tanky frontline. During teamfights youre going to try and assassinate their squishies and use your jump reset to get back out. While not ideal you do also have a lot of peel potential between your Frost Queens claim and ult. EDIT These downvotes are amusing me. Anyways while I dont know if you can find the video I couldnt Valkrin took AP Trist top against Dyrus playing Jax back on May . Used the build I mentioned.

1109544,0,t1_chu2ajo,Yea I am afraid of this. My reasoning is that an Aoe slow on everyone and a stronger targeted slow is decent utility. Given this the Rylais Liandrys combo fits this style  not as the the optimal damage items but as the best damage items to get fitting the tank playstyle whilst providing utility. gtNo DoT skills arent spammable enough for burn to be effective.This is straight up false that his skills arent spammable enough for it  his e has a . second CD with  cdr making it perfectly align with the Liandrys burn. Vlad makes about the most of the RylaisLiandrys combo that anyone can due to his qe but that does not mean it is enough in this case to make it a viable build. As to Vlads role with this  he will still have pretty good aoe damage due to Liandrys and he is meant to act as a meat shield in front of the enemy squishies healing up their damage and slowing them all while aoe burning the whole team.

1205155,0,t3_27wvag,Two thoughts  AP not only gives Vlad offense  but it is a core defensive stat on him as well.  He scales AP into health via his passive.  His Q and the spell vamp he buys will return more health via AP.  Building AP gives him both offense and defense.  Building tank only gives him defense.  The best way to scale selfhealing of all sorts lifesteal spell vamp heals is to buy resistances.  If you have  hp but  armor and mr each point you heal back gives you a  to  effective hp ratio.  If you selfheal  hp back you merely get  more effective hp.  If you instead have  hp and have  armor and  mr each point of health you selfheal gets boosted by your resistances.  Therefore your effective HP pool is greater by prioritizing resistances.  The way resistances work  every  armormr means it takes x the damage of that type to kill you.

1215954,0,t3_280brn,If youre going to play Janna then you need to be thinking about the times when you wont want to play Janna.Janna is a disengage based support shes all about keeping her ADC safe and in lane farming up.  Shes also not a tank so consider the following situations when picking your second support A Your team has no tank.  B Your ADC is an agressive in your face pick like a Corki and you need to engage with. C The enemy team picks something you dont want to deal with in lane like a Leona Yes Janna is a theoretical counter to Leona but if youre a Janna main you know exactly how much of a pain aggressive lanes are to deal with and Leona is the queen of that.So you want someone tanky with a decent engage who can deal with an agressive lane.  Thresh Leona Braum and Alistar are the obvious choices here.  Try them all see which one you love best.  Alistar isnt popular right now which is a bonus if youre trying to main him and worth watching closely next patch the new support item may very well make him OP due to the fact that he has an AoE spammable heal.

Everyone seems to have a hard on for how good an ad spellvamp item would be for champions like Talon or Pantheon while simultaneously failing to realize that Spellvamp is garbage on heavy burst champions and would only serve to make sustained damage bruisers like Lee Sin even more dominant. . Liandrys  I seriously dont understand what people see in Liandrys that causes them to lose their shit and attempt to jam the item in a halfbaked build because of some awkward synergy with a skill or another item. Its expensive and significantly goldinefficient  meaning that only if you can utilize the passive is the item worth it. Its based on once again sustained damage bruisers and tanks since the item gives an inherent scaling baseline amount of damage. It also doesnt apply off of Onhit Effects so everyone that assumes Liandrys is great on Teemo because it applies to Toxic Shot is an ignorant dolt.

1562583,0,t1_cjc3mih,I disagree.  She has really solid gold generation as a support champion because you get so many assists from her passive and can stay way in the back of a fight most of the time since your job is to peel and disengage for your back line.You might not always get to the full deathcap but her core items are some of the cheapest in the game.  Talisman Mobi Boots Sightstone Crucible Censer...nothing terribly pricey and I find that I usually finish those items pretty easily by the  minute mark letting all the rest of the gold in the game go to pink wards and whatever  AP item I need.Her issue is simply that she doesnt have damage anymore and nothing with her buff has changed that.  She cant clear a full wave with a charged Q until like  minutes into the game now her strength used to be in going to a lane clearing an entire wave in absolute safety and being halfway across the map before the Q even goes off to go help another lane.You cant do that anymore you have to sit in lane for most of the game and actually last hit with your shield up to get that CS.  You could just use TF and clear waves faster ult to get to other lanes and fill the same purpose as AP Janna mid lane does without all of the downsides.Basically she would work fine in mid lane as an AP champ but since her strength is entirely in her kit and itemsmoneyCS dont matter nearly as much she can be  as effective going support as she can mid without needing to take up an entire slot on your team that doesnt do damage late game.

I personally have gotten a lot of success with attack speed quints  reds armor yellows and  cdr blues with  mana regen just incase your mid laner is anal about buffs. It totals to  AS  Armor  CDR and  MP. I have tried heavy ad runes or hybrid adas on him and the clear times just dont feel as smooth in my opinion. His q is such a huge amount of free AD by itself and like you said it is supplemented nicely by large amounts of AS. Of course this is focused on getting the feral asap. In a game vs a strong AP dueling jungler the lack of MR would hurt a lot and would likely have to go a different route. Im going to try rushing the ghostblade build in place of the botrk although I am skeptical because the botrk active is so useful for nocs engages and passive. I guess I should include masteries too not sure what you run but maybe I missed it in my read.  with AS instead of CDR. The CDR would function well with the extra  in runes so you can reach that even  without going over or getting stuck at .

He also pairs well with a heavy dive team as he needs minimal peel. Against a beefy frontline or combined with low damage high utility allies he struggles. He isnt a late game carry. I think part of it is his kit but part of it is also his build. Tri force and BORK give a tremendous mid game power spike.

I started the season in Bronze  and last season was my first season where I was placed into bronze  and worked all the way to my series in Bronze  before the season ended. Honestly what I can tell you is that runes and masteries are huge. I went from Bronze  to Bronze  in  weeks because I just figured out what to put onto the right champ and carried every game. I did my rise with Fiddlesticks and Kat. Now that being said those were two very easy champs and not that much to learn. Honestly when you get against someone who you think is so much better than you I always just try and be aggressive because anyone can come into a match and say they are a smurf player from plat. Also just playing a lot helps. My last thing to say to you is that once you make it out of bronze which I hope most people with a year or two of serious playing do just be prepared that when you hit Silver .

When you clear the jungle it will be  your drain and bouncing crows abil.  Your drain makes it so that you cannot auto.  Just because you might weave an occasional auto between some abils doesnt mean that hybrid pen is worth it.I do like the idea of abyssal on him if you have another magic damage teammate since it will reduce enemies MR by .  If your mid is AD though and there is no major source of damage I would probably rather something that makes you tankier or gives you more damage.Other items you might want to consider are Lliandrys and ROA.  Lliandrys is great because your drain  ult  bouncing crows can all proc the passive on it multiple times.  Plus having about  magic pen from boots runes passive abyssal and Lliandrys pretty make makes true damage vs some targets.

Has a very strong level  where you can invade almost anyone in the game.  He even beats a Xin Zhao level  if you use his passive correctly Ive had that happen to me before I was very surprised after I as Xin aggroed on to him and tried to duel him.  Then an exceptionally strong level  where you can tank  turret shots from full hp using his passive so the gankage is incredible.  He can burst someone below half health with his combo around these levels.  You can take control of the game early this way.  However if this doesnt work out then your level  is ANOTHER guaranteed gank.  You can often mandrop in on bot lane and pick up a double and then rotate to dragon.  Soloqueue teams especially at lower ELOs NEVER remember to prepare for Pantheons level  mandrop.If none of these early ganks works I recommend building him Assassin Panth build for the late game simply because with more damage you have faster clears.  Run  armor Pen marks in your runes AD quints this is important.  Elder Lizard into double longswords.  Rush black cleaver last whisper maw.  Guardian Angel and Mercs to finish the build.  Skip boots completely until midlate to maintain a combat stat advantage.  You will be able to clear quite fast once your E scales.  You should also be able to  any squishy on the enemy team late game should you get a good man drop or instead you can be the tank destroyer who supports your squishes as you can stun any diving tanks and then your burst will take about  health of the tank while also reducing their armour by .  ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,ckqah4y,1,t5_2smhl

2096793,0,t1_cl6ceu2,Well I did lightly bring this up when I mentioned his team fighting being not the best. And yes there are other top laners that are stronger than him at fighting team fights for sure. But what I am trying to say is that with the new Garen. Use him as a split pusher. Not a team fighter. This way its ok that he can be kited because thats not his role in the team. His role is to persistently split push forcing the enemy team to send at least  to try and kill him which allows his team to secure important objectives which give or give the promise of global gold and ultimately the lead. I get to this point by observing his passive change. This allows him mid to late game to regen his lost health rather quickly. Meaning instead of having to back after escaping  enemies and a tank Garen is difficult to kill he does not need to back to regen lost health because his passive will do so now and he does not need to regen lost mana because he is resourceless. Therefore he can persist and continue split pushing with frequency. So ultimately what Im trying to get at is he can now with frequency and persistence split push. Thats his purpose. But in regards to what youre saying that is true. That is why I think he should specifically be a top lane split pusher. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cl6ckiy,1,t5_2smhl

For a duo we know they will be both lower than average level because they will be a sharing an income. So the moment they split up to do two sepearate camps they are going to be getting the increased lower lvl XP. In a vaccum it might work but if all the enemy has to do is gang up v on a lane and force a turret your junglers have to respond at least partially and any stragetic value from that second jungler is nullfied.gtThe reliability issues are identical to any roamingGanking strategyIdentical in that you have just doubled their risk without an accompanying change in reward. Which is why the only roaming strategy you see at competetive level is a jungler and lane rotations. Teams are much more comfortable with running one roamer and pressuring by rotating their laners.

If you can claim it first without losing too much you get the fast track to level  and will then be able to play your advantage across the map. So if the guy takes too long to kill even if you dont lose your second buff or you take both and then get him you wont be gaining anything. Youll fall behind while getting the buff and be vulnerable during. And then after youll be trying to catch up. But if you can take him quickly then it comes down to the dueling situation described in the first post and there has to be a contest over it. Otherwise if you give it up for free then youll lose the exp race while they farm and fall really behind. At that point they dont even have to take the buff again just stop you from taking it which would be easy with their levelfarm advantage. So the buff will either be not worth taking or the decider in which jungler comes out ahead. I dont think it would actually add to the strategic depth unless the balance was absolutely spot on. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,clvjuu3,1,t5_2smhl

I have had a lot of games where my ADC will have x the CS as the enemy  mins in.  Lets face it you arent playing Xer support because of his kits great utility.  His strength is his ability to poke and win early laning phase.  Maxing Q then W allows you to maximize this potential the best and snowball you.

I messed around with a lot of things  I was using Tear for a while for manamunew spam but it tended to be a pain to fully charge.

His passive let him store up to two arrows so his first two shots would go at max attack speed. The arrows would store at essentially his attack speed. What this did was allow him to kite without taking a huge loss to DPS since any time spent moving would simply recharge one or both of his passive stacks. On top of that his Q was a toggle between onhit damage or an onhit slow his W allowed a dash after he hit a target a few times and his ultimate made impassable terrain passable for a few seconds and gave him and allies a movespeed boost. And even on top of all that Dawngate actually had really amazing onhit items.

Q . W and . R would be quite low. But when you can deal damage with that . AP ratio at least once per second assuming . attack speed it becomes much more impressive.

Outplay means EVERYTHING in mid lane because skillshots exist.Azir is definitely top tier. He just takes massive amounts of skill to play. Leblanc stays in the top even without DFG because she can still easily delete anyone midlane.Lissandra is more difficult to put on the list because she can knock out the assassins but shes not as great against mages.

3347918,0,t3_2ygeh7,KAYLE KAYLE KAYLE....If your going to insist on playing AP tops and expect to be a serious lane bully everytime you play against a tank Id heavily recommend Kayle. With TP and a flask start you can push the waves early earn yourself a quick back to pick up a doran or codex and return back to lane quickly to force your lane opponent into a real tough place to be. Clever Qs from kayle also wreck Nasus ability to build stacks and its super troll but who cares its nasus! Many different ways to build Kayle too but i personally prefer attack speed kayle so a BORK isnt out of the question for further tank bullying on top of arguably the best morello user in the game. She honestly can proc the morello so easily with her E while simultaneously peeling and kiting with the rest of her kit that she is a nightmare for double bruiser comps and any front line tanks. If you want to trade carry potential for utility I would recommend Lulu. Same function in lane and her abilities are even more troll in terms of keeping you opponent off CS. You want to last hit? Take a W. Minion still alive? This winion clearly deserves a shield! They cant last hit or trade without taking ridiculous damage.Kayle and Lulu are the definition of AP top lane bullies. I never understood the misconception of Lissandra as a lane bully. Her burst is pretty low compared to other mages and her skills make her more liken a safe laner that makes her name in team fights. Honestly give Kayle and Lulu ago against the tanks of top and there only going to look better when the tank get more popular in the jungle. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cp9vzho,1,t5_2smhl

3435460,0,t3_2zkwb0,The jungle enchantments are kinda the same thing as the items before. Now you just have to chose between different smite effects before going for your enchantment.After your first clear with hunters machete you chose one of the  item for g they dont give any stat just smite effects. So you can build any of them on any jungler just depending on what you want to do Poachers knife is made for counterjungling the smite CD will be halved if you smite in the enemy jungle. The issue with this is that when you buy it you basically say your enemy hey Im going into your jungle and its not that strong so its never used. Skirmishers Sabre is more for AA AS based champions because with this one you can smite champions who will then be marked for sec. While marked your AAs will deal bonus true damages to them and they will do  reduced damages to you. This is more for duel champions who want to pick and kill the enemy jungler in his jungle but it can be used for ganks with champs like Yi if your laners have strong CC Stalkers Blade is more gank oriented. Like the one above it allows you to smite champions it will steal  of their move speed to give it to you for sec. it will also deal true damages. Finally you have the rangers trailblazer which is more for tank junglers. It will deal  of the smite damage in an area and stunn all monsters hit. It will also heal you for  of your missing health. Its mainly to help tank junglers who already have the CC needed to not pick stalkers blade but wont have the damagessustain to keep jungling.Once you get there from any of those items you can build one of the  enchantments. Basically Devourer is for AS champs Warrior for AD champs Magus for AP champs Cinderhulk for Tank champs this one is just new and replaces a previous version. It seems better now since it helps tank junglers to clear early with a sunfire effect.About the new items nothing special Ludens echo The new  AP item to replace the DFG RIP is a statikk like for AP champs seems good but not exceptional Essence reaver is not used that much its an AD item with a passive to restore mana on AAs. Could be good on Ezreal GP... But not that much on urgot wich clearly lack of the onhit effect on his Q ZZ rot portal is really niche and has not seen yet a really good use talking about pro plays or high elo trends but it has potential. Its a tank item  armor and MR which make it the highest MR item of the game with a passive allowing to splitpush its open a portal with creatures of the void voidspawn helping to push Important detail trinkets have been buffed and price lowered the upgraded yellow is a must buy as soon as you get level  if you dont need the red to swipe wards,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cpjv9aj,1,t5_2smhl

On the other hand  crit damage means no improved damage until you have crit and once you have PD  IE your overall damage increase will only be   chance to crit while still having fewer chances to reset Q and fewer true damage procs.Even with  crit chance due to your build crit damage runes still do less damage per second int he absolute best scenario as opposed to attack speed runes.

3649512,0,t1_cq88mfo,Fundamentally this is just reiterating the same point Support Brand is a semicarry. He has some CC he has some damage. Now I agree with you that semicarries have value and are strong sometimes so I dont really think we need to contend with whether or not Support Brand has a place any more than we need to cover whether semicarries have a place.That said the slice of drafts with both a place for a semicarry in the support role and a need for Brands very specific power that wont also suffer from his lack of flexibility or his other omissions of utility is very very narrow. The games where Support Brand is the best choice are very few.

3698654,0,t3_32oqdv,If were talking balance theres a very good reason Riot gives tanks  HP damage.First of all we have to recognize that a true tank that does literally no damage is not really a concept that works in league. Its too easy to ignore them if they pose no kill threat at all. So if we accept the idea that tanks need some sort of damage we have  optionsA. Give them high ratios. Obviously this makes no sense as we want tanks to build tanky not AD or AP. B. Give them high base damage. This tends to backfire pretty bad as not only does it give them really uneven scaling Super strong mid game fall off late game but it also sometimes leads to the champs getting sent to solo lanes and stacking penetration items to become a burst champ.C. Give them healtharmormr ratios. This works to a certain extent but it is tied to the amount of gold you earn so its not ideal on tanks that jungle or support. Riot does have a lot of these as well.D.  max health damage.

Ashe has always been bad when jumped on and the rework takes her upfront damage potential and moves it into sustained damage which reinforces that weakness in exchange for her having quite a lot of damage if she gets the right Q off. Softening a wave up with Volley you then get to crit the minions automatically which makes last hitting easier.What it comes down to is the fact that Rangers Focus isnt good unless you can initiate trades when you have your stacks up.

3886855,0,t3_34wdmu,Shiv is better than PD early because its more costefficient especially if you nab a couple hundred gold from Avarice Blade and the flat damage of the chain lightning proc will be a larger proportion of your total damage output. Minor points Shiv also provides supplemental waveclear and more immediate burst damage. Its pretty much universally a better buy than PD until full build at which point price no longer matters and you should swap Shiv out for PD because PD gives you better damage for the item slot.PDs ghost passive is nice but minion block isnt typically a big deal for ranged champs. Its mostly a laning phase problem anyway which is not terribly applicable by the time anybodys actually buying a PD since youd never complete it sooner than second item. Dont overvalue it.Lifesteal helps you sustain through the greater amount of and stronger poke damage youre liable to see once the laning phase breaks down. Its less useful but not useless in lane since potions are still substantial healing items and you deal less damage so you wont be lifestealing as much anyway. It makes sense to pick it up third if you dont sorely need Last Whisper yet for damage output since IE  ShivPD is by far the best twoitem build for raw DPS. This is also when you need to start considering selling Dorans Blades just to make room in your inventory in which case you need to recoup the LS you lose by buying a real LS item.Of course all very general stuff. You can go more pokebased which Corki and Ezreal often do. Graves may want seconditem LW because his main draw is a big burst of physical spell damage which doesnt scale with AS or Crit anyway while Vayne and Kogmaw can get away with not buying LW at all due to their nonphysical damage output. Ghostblade is a good alternative to ShivPD if you want the CDR or expect more duelingskirmishing where the active excels than fullblown v teamfights. Some enemy team comps may beg for you to buy a defensive item third. blah blah blah,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cqzc2qc,3,t5_2smhl

3889240,0,t3_34n4uh,I have a friend who plays Azir and swears by running  CDR in runes  masteries then building Morello  Stinger to hit  ASAP. Itll usually give him three autos instead of two if the enemy isnt completely on point with their reaction to a soldier hitting them which makes up for the AP thats missing at the start. The flexibility in soldier positioning and mobility this gives him is pretty ridiculous too.He only upgrades it to Nashors as his final purchase of the game though. Hitting  CDR is important but for the upgrade cost you could have an NLR to build into a better item.For pro play I do think youre correct that they value hard AP burst more  in a tournament setting youre never going to get that rd auto because of your opponents reaction time so making the most of what you have is better.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cqzlvc0,1,t5_2smhl

3941551,0,t1_cr58mve,I in no way disagree that a HG TP engage is very powerful but you do have to pay a price for this strategy.  Investing the gold into tier  boots and spending the  second CD on TP means this strategy is quite limited.  Im fine with Summoner Spells being high impact.  Having flash available is just as impactful on champions like Annie or Jinx.  Secondly I think Hecarims unique synergy with movespeed is almost single handedly warping the power of HG TP play.  Upgrading boots to tier  doesnt impact his power because hes also buying attack damage via his passive.  Introducing a generous soft cap on the amount of bonus AD he gets from Move Speed would probably help fix this problem alone.  Enough limitation so that it wouldnt affect Devastating Charge or Ghost but enough so that a full tank Hecarim cant kill an ADC with  combo whenever TP is up.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cr5kjqm,2,t5_2smhl

4355493,0,t3_3av7l9,I think we can agree that just like most other new champions his numbers are ridiculous. His health damage and AP scalings are huge threats and despite being melee his AA range is decent. Ive played around with different builds and so far the build Ive found more success with in the top lane  ampnbsp     Triforce Frozen Heart Spirit VisageBanshees Thornmail Haunting GuiseAbyssal Scepter Merc TreadsTabisSorcs.   ampnbsp    The reasoning goes Tahms primary damage source is magic damage. In addition he has incredible basedamage so unless Riot decides to completely wreck his base damage in upcoming patches magic pen. seems like a better option than raw AP. Haunting Guise provides magic pen. and health both of which amplify his damage and could serve as a great item if you are ahead. Alternatively Abyssal Scepter may work well against AP heavy comps and will also strengthen the damage coming from your Thornmail.      ampnbsp  Triforce might sound counterintuitive on an AP champion like Tahm but the stats and passives it provides synergizes well with his kit. The phage and zeal assist him in sticking to the enemy target and getting off multiple autos while the sheen grants him excellent burst. Iceborn Gauntlet and Frozen Mallet may be viable alternatives but I havent tried it out yet. The former would work well with the CDR it provides much like Frozen Heart so you can use your Q and W multiple times in teamfights while the latter in theory might sound like a decent purchase with the extra health adding to your autos.  ampnbsp   I think the main problem with Tahm is engaging effectively. He lacks hard CC without getting several autos on targets. He has some flank potential with his ult and TP if you take him to the top lane but the range on the ability is lower than the other ults of the same category in the early game TFPantheon having  range RekSai being global while Tahms ult has a  range at rank . All in all I think he has the potentials of making an excellent toplaner that can snowball hard given the appropriate teamcomps that have sufficient engage.  ampnbsp    ....and as I write this I am reminded of Righteous Glory. Have not tested that on him yet it might work but you will need more sources of resistances unless you go fulltank. It might work better if the junglersupport builds the item instead though. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,csgli1q,7,t5_2smhl

4606746,0,t3_3e3pds,Passive Possibly scales with AD does not benefit from attack speed or armor pen.Q Scales with AD for sure might have good base damage. Maybe it can crit? Could benefit a lot from CDR.W Deals some kind of damage whether its physical or magical I dont know but this is primarily utility anyway.E Benefits from AD and CDR maybe a bit from attack speed so you use it faster but heavily disincentivises crit chance because the two basic attacks arent affected by it.R Probably scales a bit with AD does not benefit from crit chance or armor pen attack speed probably wont help much either.Its worth mentioning that she would benefit a lot from spirit visage and resistances with all that healing she has going on.For some context up until now Fiora was played as an armor pen assassin She scales badly with crit because her Q and R cant crit neither can Hydra active and thats a large portion of her damage. So they focused on CDR and penetration with a lot of hard AD. Hydra was core because she has no waveclear.New Fiora scales similarly but worse with Arpen because of all the true damage. Crit chance looks entirely out of the question IMO nothing in her kit benefits from it and E outright discourages it because theres no chance involved.Another thing. Fiora builds glass cannon now. Why? Because she can get away with it. She gapcloses and bursts down targets really fast and her ult is like a getoutofjail free card that lets her lifesteal some health back and prevents her from taking almost any damage. Riposte also gives her a tiny bit of defence against ranged champions.I dont think glass cannon will work with the new Fiora unless you avoid teamfights entirely. Her ulti in particular will almost force you to tunnel on a single opponent making you an easy target of focus. I think she might go Hydra into tank maybe Triforce will be good on her depending on the cooldowns. Still has the waveclear issue without it. Tenacity will be a must so that you can maneuver comfortably around your targets.I wonder how potent Riposte is exactly.

4752560,0,t3_3fxlwx,There are many things ranging from small to big that make LoL more likely to have optimal framework for meta.Melee hardcarries wont work so well because they are more easily kited as LoL has no turn rate. They also die pretty much instantly in teamfights as we dont have BKB. Autoattack damage scaling is very multiplicative so most champions need to build very much like a glass cannon to deal good lategame dps.I dont have data but i think DotA jungle gives much more gold compared to lanes than the one LoL has especially as camps can be stacked. This means that someone like AM can farm jungle camps safely and get massive gold income whereas in LoL and afk jungle farmer would be poorer and have less levels than solo laners getting reasonable minion scores.Almost all abilities also scale in LoL so even if a carry builds hp and magic resistance it wont make him durable against mages as they buy ability powermakes their spells do more dmg and magic penetrationflat or  magic resist ignore.Supports get more gold relative to carries in lol and in general the power difference between carry and support in lategame is much smaller.Ranged autoattackers have worse stats so for them to do good dmg they need to usually build only damage items exept maybe one defensive item in lategame. This makes them very vulnerable but they are the best champion type to kill towers and roshanlike monsters so they are very close to mandatory.This is greatly amplified by ranged autoattackers being the only carry type that is not level dependant as they scale mostly from pure multiplicative item combinations unlike mages and meleecarriersbruisers who rely more on levels and skills. This means that they are fine to have reduced xp from duo laning which is required because there are only  gold streams so one lane has to sharejungle is too scarce to support  farmers.There are more things and some have been mentioned in this thread already.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cttlsvq,1,t5_2smhl

Does the champion benefit from Health maybe an HP Scaling like Braum Does the Champion have a defensive steroid that makes building resistances less important than health Leona can get away with a few more health options due to her W etc. Ive seen many Fizz and Ekko junglers go tanky and would assume that Fizz top could be built in a similar way BOTRK Triforce Tank.    Am I building other Tank Items?    a.If Cinderhulk is your only health  Defensive Item or the only one youll build for a while I wouldnt consider it worth it. If you plan to build full tank it may still be useful.     Does my team have other tanks?    a.If your team has other tanks that will be soaking the majority of damage possibly consider a normal AD or AP build but with maybe two defensive items instead of the typical one. On Fizz I could see a Guardian Angel or Banshees being great on him for the passives as well as the resistances offered. If top a Banner of Command may even be a good purchase for a offensivedefensive item as it offers both types of stats all of which I think benefit Fizz.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cuawoaq,0,t5_2smhl
4903033,0,t3_3hzmb8,I had my friend try it in a normals. He had Triforce sterak and TH and he got a ga and FH and merc treads. It was a long game that we had been losing from the start and he went TH last out of the damage items so he could stack his q. It worked well. He had the most damage in the game despite the enemy having a fed vayne who shredded his hp. I think he had k dmg meanwhile I as a semi fed shyvana Jg had k. It was pretty strong and fun to do. His random crits would nuke pretty hard on q. Its not bad since both items give a ton of hp you have to buy resists though. Id recommend it vs a full ad team since you can just buy thorn mail FH and tabi to round out the hp you get with armor. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cuckd1w,1,t5_2smhl
4915442,0,t1_cucm55u,Its kind of like valors mark but they spawn in  different quadrants of the enemy hero and are only consumed when you hit them from that angle. Your q and w allow to proc them from outside melee range.The marks close to you are easy to proc by using q to dash to their angle but the backside marks are harder as you need to get behind them and take minion aggro.You can reset the mark by walking maybe a screen away from your enemy so that you have more time with the easy to proc marks.When you hit a vital a new one spawns very fast.s or smt so fiora has potential to proc them a lot more often than quinn usually does with her marks.I feel like its easy to hit the vitals against dashless melee champions but good rivens and especially yasuos can make hitting them tricky.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cue4nna,2,t5_2smhl

4923840,0,t3_3iccqh,I dont play karma mid since her rework but I play primarily karma support when I do. So with that experience and playing a few ori and lots of azir I can tell you Karma mid is viable. The thing is her she is the AP version of lee sin or renkton. Strong early game but weak late game similar to lulu. Havent checked her ratios but either way shes not a champion that can kill someone with one rotation of their skills like viktor or orianna. Like i said I dont know her ratios but if they do scale good her base damage isnt that good. Yes her empowered Q does a lot but I never expect both ticks to go off. I think she is a good pick mid especially if you want to throw people off. But like lulu she excels in pokingsupport another carry. She herself is not the carry. If youre fed youre fed. When youre fed you beat them with your goldexp advantage and snowballing it to victory. The thing that makes her unique compared to other midsself heal with RW comboAoe Shield  move spd buffWhy shes a good mid good wave clearpoke  good utility with slows and move spd buffs  lane bully Happy jungler because her snare makes ganks much easier. Shields makes things less scary. Cons one primary damage skills needs to have clear shot. Minions and tanks can block Q players not experienced with skills will have a harder time My guide build. Morellos. Athenes if you need the MR but typically Morellos because more AP for the slot same amount of CDR grievous wound to people under  hp. Either of these are a must as shes a poke champion more than what control mage. So CDR  mana regen for spamming. Archangels is not as optimal on her because of the lack of CDR. Karma doesnt really make use of the huge mana pull. Karma already has a built in shield. Takes away early pressure from Karma. . Sorc boots at a timely fashion. Finish your boots after Morellos. With my experience you want optimal buys. If you back with g get your needlessly large rod for g if you have less then get sorc boots. Magic pen helps with the double tick of empowered Q and W. . Ludens Echo. One of the cheaper big ap items so you finish it faster. Also it has a really powerful passive. Karma has lots of spells to spam to keep the charges up. Her shield also helps. Im an aggressive karma support so many times I ended up winning the lane as a support and go full ap with only two support items  sight stone and ancient coins final form Ludens is the strongest power spike karma will get for entire game. Empowered Q  Ludens damage is insane for a poke. The same satisfying feeling of landing Nidalee Q  I also happened to play a shit ton of nidalee  i like poke champs. These are her core itemsbuild path the rest should be adapting to what the team needs. Liandry is a good pick up because Karma has a built in slow. Extra hp also helps a little bit since her empowered W heals via percentage health. Rylias I find is alright if youre in a situation where you need to lane the snare on her W. But usually you can W someone then E yourself for the move spd buff as well as Q to slow them. edit on support i skip Morellos and go straight into ludens or sorc boots after sight stone,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cuf6svp,3,t5_2smhl

5082094,0,t1_cuyapp4,Yes its mostly done by either comparing gold or  of change of a particular nerf or buff. From my understanding of your example the numerical changes to thresh refer to nerfing of numbers on his QWER abilities base stats or core items of said champion. They do not include unquantifiable stats such as the delay on Thresh ultimate that was in introduced in patch .  By the word quantifiable I mean that which can be reduced to a set equal or similar equivalent of said gold amount. You can do a Max Calculation of abilities at various levels. You know that health is valued at . gold per  HP. In a hypothetical scenario if the shield was nerfed by  effective HP at all ranks.  Lowered to            AP from            APAt the very basic calculations you can come to the conclusion that Thresh lost . gold at all ranks on his Lantern due to loss of effective HP on his shield. Alternatively .    .  .  .  of his original power on that ability. I used to do Max Calculations a lot a couple of years ago. It basically means to take into account all possible factors into the equation an run several simulations at different levels for example   and . The factors include but not limited to runes base stats mast. items cooldowns ad crit  the targets CCresistances etc. League of Legends is based around numbers which means these things can be estimated. I used to play a shit ton of Renekton back in the day. I would be able to calculate the exact damage output when performing a full combo with auto attack resets etc. versus a particular match up their estimated abilities. In the vacuum of testing I could find the best possible damage build that way. In the end can you do a true test of nerfs and buffs on different champions? Thats hard to say. In most cases I would say no unless their kit is similar. Does that lead you in the right direction? What are your thoughts about comparing gold value or percentage strength? ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cuyl31v,1,t5_2smhl

Youmuus active is actually pretty good on Yasuo It looks pretty cool too so samurailike haha. After that Id get some AD to maximise your damage and some lifesteal to survive. Either go for Blood Thirster or Ravenous Hydra. My favorite is Ravenous. Because it procs so nicely on your q and it gives that AoE damage you now lack since you dont have statikk shiv. The rest of the build is entirely up to you. I usually like to get both BT and RH for the shields AD and lifesteal. Combined with your passive shield your windwall and perhaps a hexdrinker youll be deceptively hard to kill and thats a really deadly combination with your huge mobility and insane damage.

Since she can poke with Q and it applies onhit effects and since MF is notorious for not being able to thrive in AA range late game and since her late game teamfights tend to revolve around dropping E and then R and not even bothering to autoattack except for cleanup she could actually benefit from having a really high AD without prioritizing crit or AS.The extra mana is what benefits her E. Not her AD. If she can cast a big ranged AOE slow whenever she wants it makes her bullying stronger and protects her from mid lane ganks.

Having just  win condition that is reliant on your ULT cds is too easy to play around for a smart enemy team.  I guess its a question of reliability vs synergy.

Never use it in the jungle. It sets you too far back.. Any champion using crit damage will be set back early on even Tryndamere needs to build rage first vs. attack speed makes it easier to build rage.. Crit damage needs a good deal of crit to be useful. Compare it to all the others which are useful without such conditions dependent on base ratios instead.. Of the scaling runes armor pen can be used on many champions and the same is for AD per level. And they also scale with crit and are more flexible.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,cxppeiv,1,t5_2smhl

Im not contradicting anything. You are looking for errors instead of understanding what i am posting. Ziggs is another easy lane for Grag. Go in when he tries to harass and burst him. You can stop is satchel escape with R fairly easily. Also Grag has over HP lvl .....Obviously Kassadin has a bad laning phase. Thats why i was referring to him! You have to play like a bitch and freeze land right outside your turret for the first few lvls. Gragas also has dmg reduc and a aoe harass.His style of play ofc adjusts with this build and you can build more defense situationally. Grab a SV or Abyssal. The glass cannon build is best if you are snowballing. I said Gragas outscales LB which he certainly does not that this is the case for every matchup. you are generalizing specific situations im referring to and once again taking things out of context.AP Grag may be more suited to v play rather than Solo Queue but it is a viable pick nonetheless.

6408833,0,t1_czhxdr9,gt Yeah sorry. Posted that on my mobile before sleeping. I had mentioned it before too that CDR is good on Shen as it allows more passive shield procs. IIRC Grasp has a  second cooldown.Technically? But as soon as you use grasp you can start stacking it back up again. So its not really a cooldown.gtWhy not? Youre more likely to get more autos with triforcebc or botrk than you are with titanic thats for sure due to their passives and actives.Because a little bit of attack speed doesnt mean you can get  autos off easily factoring in QSS Dashes and all that good stuff. Its just not really logical.gtThats only if the Q hits the enemy as the sword is travelling to Shen which will likely only happen once if you can get the sword placed behind them before the trade.Its actually extremely easy to get the sword to come back on the enemy if you taunt them. And even if you dont most people dont think to dodge.gtTri gives hp cdr attack speed as well as sheencrit movement speedrage passive. Irelias have been abusing the triforce into pure tank for awhile now and her lowest base cooldown is  seconds whereas Shens is now only  sec.Yes but Irelia builds tri force spikes in mid game and then promptly gets outscaled. Shen has a strong early game and a strong late game. gtOne of the best onhit items that grants as much attack speed as a ruunans and a targeted slowheal.Youll do more damage in a  second taunt on a squishy target with titanic than botrk.gtpossibly against a team with mostly AD since very few armor items for Shen have good cdr unlike going magic resist i.e. SV Locket.if youre building more than one damage item on shen against an all AD team then youre massively not understanding how to counter all ad comps. Also you really dont need CDR that much.gtTitanic is bought for split pushingyou mean the thing that is literally built into shens kit.gtHowever depending on the targets armor the BCs armor reduction will cause Shens autos to do more than that.Shens autos do no damage. Its his Q thats the main stay. And his Q auto damage is magic.Shen is meant to be a late game mega tank.

6761772,0,t1_d0gf758,Yeah WW is definately one of the answers here.           He has some of the very best ganks in the game WHEN his ult is up.  They suck when its down but there is often at least one lane where you are almost guaranteed to get a kill when you gank with ult.  And if we are talking about a powerfarming style the fact that his ganks suck without ult isnt a big deal... just do your farm kill with ult... and then farm again till its up.          Not only that but a late game WW with a relatively cheap full build like devourer wits end boots spirit visage armor tank item flex tank item is one of the mathematically strongest champs in the game.  I know the game is much more than a series of v me bros but from just a raw math perspective Im not sure anybody can beat WW v assuming both are in range of each other and doing damage.  Maybe if a Malz gets a full combo off on him?  I know Ive played hundreds of WW games and never been killed v except by a kalista or vayne with good kiting.  Hes not a great splitpusher himself but he is really good at shutting down splitpushers although you dont have TP but we are talking about soloqueue here I assume.  Other than like a splitting vayne or something you will never have to worry late game about the situation where their split pusher seperates and your team has no one person who can stop them by themselves.          Of course saying if they are both in range doing damage a big assumption considering being kited is one of his weaknesses but just giving an example of how strong his math is.  People REALLY underestimate it.  He does CRAZY damage for how tanky he is.         He is especially strong again teams which are relatively lower damage like a tankier team because his lifesteal so to speak makes him the king of long drawn out fights.          My winrate with him also goes up significantly if he isnt the tankiest person on the team and isnt relied to to initiate.  Hes almost impossible to grind down but he can be mass bursted down where his lifesteal doesnt matter.  If you are the only tank and supposed to start off the fight by ulting somebody on their side and its not a pick you are going to have a bad time.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,d0iq3ml,1,t5_2smhl

6834721,0,t3_49dr3x,Theres no general optimal ADC build. IE or Reaver for caster ADCs into a zeal item is like the only sure part for a standard ADC build. A nd zeal item when you already have IE is generally the best pure DPS choice as far as I know.The thing is nowadays you need to think about stuff other than raw DPS even when youre buying your nd item. Often you need Shiv waveclear or PD instead of the more commonly core zeal items like Hurricane and RFC. Also Dominiks is a situational item against armor stacking not as vital as Last Whisper used to be. Its often a th or last item nowadays sometimes you dont even need it. I rarely see Bork nowadays on standard IEtype ADC builds since it got nerfed gt current hp damage higher cost and doesnt synergise with crit.Then you have the defensive items. Mercurial and Steraks are the best ones in general. BT can be useful especially against poke but it feels like youre overspending on lifesteal which is shit if you get CCchained or bursted down.

8412053,0,t1_d5t182v,gt Doesnt matter as far as Im concerned.It should matter. Every level gives  gold in free stats. Eventually your ganks will become near useless because of a  gold discrepancy in stats. gt Its only a little exp.A little EXP makes the difference between level  and level . If your mid laner gets killed because you leeched and the enemy laner hit  first its your fault.gt Plus if you stay bot you hard leech xp from your adc no?The meta has  champions bot lane because the ADC relies on gold not levels. It doesnt matter if you share EXP with an ADC. gtWith bards movement speed  ranged burst the jgler cannot do much except chase you and waste time.You wont have ranged burst if the enemy jungler is  levels above you. Even with your E into Q stun you wont escape an Elise or Nidalee.Please link your op.gg so I can see how this playstyle transitions into victories. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,d5t1u04,4,t5_2smhl

8943815,0,t1_d7mlox8,Part of the reason why wits end worked was the price of the item.  Wits end into runnans is essentially k gold cheaper than a regular adc build of IE or ER and allows kog to do his job in teamfights earlier.  If you are going into lane with a wits and parts of nashors you are going to lose out on trades until you complete it and a good bot lane will take advantage easily.  ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,d7mwy2h,3,t5_2smhl

9313459,0,t1_d8wismf,gt you can manipulate how you present the numbers however you want. The fact is that in  there were TWICE as many offmeta picks as .Im just reporting the numbers albeit more legible that youve stating but without backing. Whether I choose to state it as the average percent meta pick  or state it as the average percent off meta pick  it really dont help your argument.Yes twice as many of  in  were off meta. Which still means that  were meta picks.  Which bringing us back to the OP means that  out of  picks are still meta in the years you consider diverse as opposed to . out of .The average even with the outliers is still  meaning in  we realistically only saw an increase of  off meta picks.gt in terms of actual viewer experience looking at picks not pickban is more telling and the difference between  and  is enormous. when  of picks not games PICKS are offmeta you are seeing something unique at least every few games.when the pick rate is half of that the subjective experience for the viewer is much more homogeneous.lol subjective experience more homogenous... cmon youre reaching..

10024326,0,t3_5j6vpg,Just random shit Ive seen at the equivalent of dd eloPoppy is the safest blind pick top lane. Maokai with corrupting and double dorans trades fine with him and IMO outperforms poppy in teamfights at equal skill. If poppy is a division in skill over the rest of the game she can take over with good teamfights Ults and flanks but its not as easy as maokai. Mao performs better vs double AP and with teamfights ADCs poppy is better vs melee ads and with vayneez. Naut is alright but is also counterable. I really dont think nasus is that great unless the other team is running twitch other ADCs play around him too well. SwainRyze are pretty good counterpick to tank tops but not blind pickable. Actually just swain Ryze is stupid fucking busted. Yas is really good vs twitch vayne maokai any top lane who doesnt have a response to his mobility. Everyone else is irrelevant and just asking to get smashed imo.In jungle Lee vi HEC and Zac are the only top tiers right now imo. Noct and skarner are niche but those  are pretty blind pickable. Lee needs to establish early game pressure Zac has strongest engage HEC has great map presenceganks vi can randomly turn game around with her picks. Eve maybe if youre like  divisions up in skill.Mid lane lbgtsyndragtViktorgt whoever. Ahris pretty good I think but nobody else really stands out. Bot Lane is like... Vayne Cait jhin twitch maybe ez. IMO if you cant rush redemption locket effectively youre basically useless as a support rn. Nami turns a bad lane into a decent one karma turns a decent lane into a winning one soraka turns any lane into a draw. In order of gank vulnerability soraka then nami then karma. I guess Janna if you have total faith in your ADC and youre running  front liners? Ive seen so many games where other team had zyra or brand and I just know theyre not contributing anything after  min idk. ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,dbe74go,2,t5_2smhl

10065329,0,t1_dbjfemy,it looked to me like doublelift had no idea how to deal with the lane he ate a lot of qs which should be easy to dodge as vayne with tumble.  the waveclear from ziggs was pretty heavy though but that just means that a gank would be a lot easier especially with an alistar.  and then he runs pretty quickly if he tries to waveclear and harass at the same time.  it wasnt a very eventful game to watch though but just from tower pushing and waveclear it was pretty good.  ,LeagueofLegendsMeta,dbjjalw,6,t5_2smhl
10237273,0,t3_5mkqs8,AP kennen and AD kennen are completely different playstyles and trying to mix them doesnt really work.AD kennen kites and uses stun for peel. AP kennen dives in head first and blows everyone up. With your proposed hybrid build he sucks at both. max CDR is also really bad on most energy champs because they just run out of energy after a rotation and a half of spells. Its better to invest in hitting hard than hitting often because they wont be able to hit often for long anyway.,LeagueofLegendsMeta,dc4ga2f,11,t5_2smhl
