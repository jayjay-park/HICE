5241734,0,t3_3mru5y,The one thing that made me feel better about Yakutia is that they seem to be plotting against pretty much everybody and doing nothing.  That could all change but waiting on Yakutia to do something has been the name of the game for  updates now.Also after Vietnams spike of brilliance they have been pretty garbage.  Seeing as half of that spike of brilliance was against China and well... it doesnt look as brilliant as before.  While I would love to eat up the remainder of China it seems like no civs have put any sort of priority on taking out their weak neighbors completely.  If China stays weak and we survive and thrive against the more dangerous Vietnam we can take their cities at our leisure.I dont think its smooth sailing but with how crazy the AI can be sometime I think we can make some headway.,LeagueofScientists,cvhthid,2,t5_39g8b
