6472597,0,t3_44agao,Honestly game support has been pretty good IMHO.  Theres FAR more support for  than SLI at least in the  months Ive had my new PC.    ampnbsp    Most support it outright or there are simple work arounds for it.  Ive yet to have to play any new game with black bars on the sides.    ampnbsp    I think the biggest PITA game Ive dealt with so far is MGS as the fix for it is a bitch.  Basically the way they programmed it the .exe file has to be modified in order to enable  for that game.  There is an awesome gentlmen out there I forget his user name that usually makes an app that modifies it for you but the  problem is EVERY TIME they update the game he has to write a new app!  And also the UI is messed up when you use it so he has a nd app to fix that but again everytime there is a new patch you need a new fix.    ampnbsp    So thats the worst case scenario!  Most games that dont support it you just have to edit a configini file to get it work like for Fallout .  UI is a tad off in that game but its not that noticable.    ampnbsp    New games that Ive got since going to a  monitor include MGS Mad Max Fallout  Just Cause  and XCom .  Of those MGS and Fallout  were the only ones I had to tweak to get it to work.  Yet of those Mad Max and MGS are the only ones that support SLI though MGS is locked at fps!  Which is pretty annoying for my new build.    ampnbsp    Ive also played Kerbal Space Program Diablo  Warframe War Thunder on it at  as well which I believe Diablo  was the only one I had to tweak a bit the rest just worked out of the box.    ampnbsp    So I hope that helps give you a bit of an idea.,ultrawidemasterrace,czot8r5,4,t5_38v30

The lines are supposedly very faint but even looking a inch away from the screen I dont see any. Im not super OCD about this though its possible the lines are only visible on certain color patterns or at specific frame rates etc didnt look into it that far.Chances are the Asus monitor will also suffer from this.

Im not sure if that works once youre below the range because Ive read the maximum freesync range must be .x the minimum freesync range for you to get low framerate compensation. ampnbspFreesync also make a screen appear more smooth. For example on my freesync monitor anything between  and  fps essentially looks like  fps. From what I can tell the effect lessens as your framerate rises. Since the range stops at  once you approach the max of the freesync range the smoothening effect should diminish however fps should definitely look better than fps with freesync applied.ampnbspI hope this makes sense its a bit hard to explain without seeing it.,ultrawidemasterrace,d42ddkg,1,t5_38v30

So unless they will release new drivers within a month or so claiming that new drivers will optimize the performance for Polaristo gtx  levels it is obvious that they did not do a good job.

It does not hold your hand and it NOT an MMO type game.  You need to enjoy flying maybe with HOTAS and have the desire to figure things out for you to enjoy it.  Other than that if you do end up play ... take care not to get stuck in a grind for that next big ship whereas trading for example make allot of CR ... it can get repetitive.  Its best to focus on stuff you like doing.  Ive played it since prerelease off and on it was a bit barebones on release I agree.  But with all the content and depth added I would say its a solid  right now.  They have done a great job with controller support and VR etc.  Their flightcombat model is really great and there attention to realism is great.  I would say it much much better for example than the over hyped No Mans Sky.

The PC would need to be the main display I would think.The other way is just the LG window management software that splits the PC windows into multiple different window arrangements but only for the  input.I would suggest maybe picking up a  x display and then a slightly smaller  display for the console since they dont run in  anyway and then getting a dual monitor arm desk mount to make it look nicer together.  Or if you really wanted to look slick get x x displays and putting them together.  Something like this,ultrawidemasterrace,dcihwty,3,t5_38v30

Turned up and the top head area was snapped in half and they smelt like theyd been used by someone who lives in a cupboard and smokes . Disgusting.My X was mint even had the cellophane on the back... but it does have the typical backlight bleed... I sent an email with photos of it etc and they refunded me around . Cant complain about that as the BLB isnt noticeable when in use.I honestly think they have such a workload that a lot of the stuff is barely inspected before a description is written.

The gamma in particular is super bad any scenes with darkness see the blacks totally crushed absolutely no detail at all.Mine also came with a dead pixel.For points freesync works fine the stand is nice and theres basically no backlight bleed.

11461209,0,t3_63ifxy,I believe this is such a common question mostly because people are thinking there has to be a better solution than buy and test and IMO there isnt.  If you want a panel thats guaranteed to not have issues its just not going to be one of these GSync ultrawides.  Youre playing the panel lottery with essentially any model its just that the stakes are higher and the odds much worse here than with standard panels.Its all about what youre willing to live with and not.  Normally as consumers we equate high price with high quality but the high price of these screens has more to do with their low production volumeunusual size than quality.  Guessing thats why theres a disconnect why am I paying  to have these issues?If thats your thinking then Id agree that a  panel with a better quality track record is the best option.  Backlight bleed panel uniformity etc. are all much more difficult issues to control on a largerwidercurved etc. screen.  I believe thats a big part of why its hard to get a good ultrawide though we could certainly stand for some better QC as well.By the way did you order this online from Costco or pick it up in store?  In my experience CostcoSams tend to be pretty forgiving about doing exchanges if you live close enough just try another unit.  If its online at least returning it shouldnt be an issue.,ultrawidemasterrace,dfv4cvx,2,t5_38v30

The other monitor thats hz and has a good curve is aoc agon  g sync but its not released yet! The Samsung is also  cheaper in my country and looks a lot better apart from g sync.

11579005,0,t1_dg8g4oj,Sorry to sound like the devils advocate but the idea of having a large  or  K screen thats as wide as an ultrawide seems awfully attractive.Pair that with a highperformance OLED panel and youve got yourself a dream display.The screen real estate is just more flexible youve got vertical space for even better multitasking and the option to crop the display to  for gaming while still maintaining an immersive size.

11795605,0,t1_dgwp3bg,Alright. Hooked up to the Acer with one HDMI . and one DP . input. It appears there is no way to get rid of the black bars. In fact I was unable to force a x resolution in the AMD drivers. Theres also no scaling option in the OSD menus that can be applied to the PiPPbP modes. By default both inputs are rescaled shrunk x to fit the half screen spaces with black bars above and below. Dropping into lower resolutions does not cause the monitor to scale the input up to fill the half side. A resolution with a smaller horizontal resolution below  had black borders on all  sides for me.,ultrawidemasterrace,dgx2lja,3,t5_38v30
