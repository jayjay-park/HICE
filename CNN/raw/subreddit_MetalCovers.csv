4398882,0,t3_3bev61,So my man musical project Metal on the Connecticut River spent a couple months on a cover of the Ninja Sex Party tune Dragon Slayer from their upcoming third album Attitude City and I wanted to share it with you all. We are an alternativeheavy metal  so the style difference between the original and our track will be a bit drastic but we hope you give it a chance. We felt it came out good a lot of heart was put into it and along with that today is also the day im releasing our first EP Chapter One through Bandcamp. It contains  songs you can listen to on the page You also get some additional musical treats that extend the experience after downloading the album at your leisure. Thank you in advance for checking this out. We are going to continue working hard at putting out more music in the notsodistant future. Enjoy!,MetalCovers,cslhlhp,1,t5_2tm0d
