Your second hour wont kick your ass as much since it isnt such a shock to your system. Next hour less again. Now keep in mind that in the beginning you will still be making huge gains just less of a gain with each subsequent session.Later on as you approach your maximum the gains will be very very modest but still increase your capability slightly.Even if the gains are negligible SS is still necessary to maintain your levels for competition.,Rowing,cf0zdju,1,t5_2qljq

By eating a lot I mean doubling what you normally would and maybe having a second lunch I did this when I first started and put on just over lbs in a month.Yes ergs are very good but I would be careful about using them without a coach because its very easy to pick up bad habits which could impede you when you start rowing on the river. I found that everyone was really helpful its a pretty close community or at least it is where I row and there always somebody to help you out.

We get it the statistics say that black people as a demographic group have a certain set of characteristics. But you know what? Fu statistics an individual is a an individual not a statistical case not a number not a percentile. And if youre going to discriminate against a person because their appearance at first glance labels them as a black to you then my own labeling you as a terrible person would not be far off mark. People like you play an powerful role in putting blacks where they are in American society. Lets see youre from Alabama your reddit nick is Eaglesandpussy ... Im sure I wouldnt be alone in mindlessly labeling you as redneck shit. But OP do you want to be labeled? Youre a product of your social conditioning but youre also a product of your own choice. Do you want to be labeled as redneck shit by us civilized europeans do you want to sit comfortably in the little social niche that you were born into predestined to a life of hatred against things you dont understand for reasons youve never questioned? The same seeming hatred you have towards blacks is mirrored in the hatred many people have for the vulgar racist Alabamanian culture you yourself stand for. Have you ever wondered why? Have you ever sincerely pondered where you are in the world? Do you want to become a better person to leave this world a bit better than you left it? Are you better than the stupid blacks you so confidently discriminate against?So do you feel like its totally okay to divide our world with barriers of ignorant hatred? I dont care if blacks go to jail more often or generally row worse. It doesnt matter. You see there is this thing called morality and decent people dont condem a person to a life of discrimination because they were born with black skin. We should treat our fellow people with brotherhood for who would opt to not be treated with tolerance themselves? Before you go ahead and spread the same destructive nonsense carried down from generation to ignorant generation I advise that you use your head. sigh Anyway no rowing is not a very popular sport in the population of black people but there are always exceptions a few brilliant ones were already posted here.EDIT looking back on this I kind of doubt that our educated friend Eablesandpussy will read this through properly.

SRAA is limited and requires qualification so therefore the average quality of the fewer crews is much higher.  Saratoga New Trier CC St. Ignatius Ridley and more are very fast crews who do not attend Stotes.Sure some teams may plan their season for Stotes but that doesnt mean at all that its the top regatta.

If the HS V is filled with  year olds that are   pull sub erg scores and are well coachednot over or under trained they will be very competitive with college V filled with  year olds with the same relative stats. An age difference of  years is not a big advantage... the difference at the college level relative to the high school level tends to be a higher concentration of top athletes at particular schools  so the team boats may be faster greater program depth because they can recruit across the countryinternationally better training programs because colleges are allowed train more hours and demand more from their athletes in terms of schedulingavailability better facilitiesresources though of course this varies... some high schools seem to have crazy amounts of money to throw at rowing.TLDR  it depends on the exact specs of the boatsprograms you are comparing. ,Rowing,ci0sty7,2,t5_2qljq

Ideally you want to be able to keep your shins vertical and your arms reaching just past the front stays of the rigger when youre at the catch. Not overextending but getting proper length. Be sure you stretch a ton! You can definitely begin to work on doing some balance drills to get yourself more comfortable with the shell. Even just googling single scull balance drills can give you some pointers. Good luck! ,Rowing,ci86fat,1,t5_2qljq

1462822,0,t3_2awdjs,I strongly recommend you get a heart rate monitor and do some testing lactic acid level testing is ideal but it can be expensive. An HR minmax should give you a general range for a lot less money.After you know your general ranges training is a lot easier to plan. Longer pieces are in your lower zones shorter ones are in your upper zones and short interval work is going to have you at the top.Im preaching heart rate for a variety of reasons.  you can take it anywhere you go except for the pool so you know your intensity exactly whenever you are training not just on the erg.  you can be sore sick tired or whatever making your workout have a different effect on you if pull the same split. With heart rate you are always at roughly the same perceived exertion levels since HR correlates with lactic acid levels.  Your heart rate zones will hardly change in comparison to your gains in splits so you dont have to manually adjust as often.Disadvantages include cost of monitor and a weird tan line if you go shirtless.,Rowing,cizn2n0,2,t5_2qljq

With regard to school choice if hes looking to be recruited to a varsityfunded team hes probably looking at an Ivy League. There are a handful of other programs Georgetown MIT and Navy I think not  sure that put out boats but outside of those ten or so schools youre most likely looking at a club team. Also honestly you cant really help him that much if he wants to row in college hes going to have to advocate for himself. You can suggest that he sign up on berecruited.com where coaches can view his profile and contact him maybe look over his application essays and emails to coaches if youre feeling generous but outside of that you really cant do his college search for him.

4173676,0,t3_38lulr,Yes. When doing speed work you want to be in that specific zone so if youre doing a workout where you need to be at race speed for xk and you dont hit it the first time then youre done. If you hit it the first but miss the second again its over. You should complete as many rounds as possible in the set while being at or very close to goal pace but you shouldnt keep doing pieces at a pace slower than goal pace. Workouts like that are to work on your speed so if you arent there then youre training to be slow. This doesnt quite apply the same to SS workouts. This only really applies to speed work. Edit Alright so everyone else says not to stop because mental toughness and yes thats important but its not always about being a complete work horse. Speed can very easily come from smart training. This is the basis of my training. My coach has used this at multiple other crews and been very very successful with this. ,Rowing,crw087e,-6,t5_2qljq

Also have your elbows up and push down on the handle rather than getting to low with the armsbody and then having to pull down. Also you need to keep accelerating the handle all the way through to the finish to keep the puddle open. The puddle is essentially means there is much less resistance around your blade and makes it easier to get out. You dont want to rip to get a puddle and you dont want it to be huge that means a lot of rippingslippage but just maintain whatever puddle is formed through the first part of the drive.Also Id recommend checking your rigging and making sure that your gate height and pitch is correct.Good luck!,Rowing,cv31blw,1,t5_2qljq

5558271,0,t1_cwm09qb,yes but running up a hill does not disproportionately load one key point in the body that is prone to failing.gtshorter steadystate like effortsthis would be known as junk miles. either its steady state where you need to go m or its faster than that.gtthat sort of injury can happen during any workoutright but its more likely to happen with a higher resistance on the damper. its also not always a question of focus even if you were the perfect trainee had perfect focus in every workout it can be a subconscious effect. if a muscle gets physically exhausted the body will stop using it and compensate with other ones.the other posters point is correct rowing faster increases the force required regardless of the damper setting because the main force you are overcoming in rowing is the force of fluid drag which is proportional to the square of velocity. In running drag is not the major player it is only a small part. Running you are basically overcoming gravity which is not related to how fast you are going. Hence runners must use hills to increase the force of gravity whereas a rower gets the same effect by just attempting to row faster.Like I said above highdrag workouts do exist but they are not extremely common and generally reserved for special training. and they are almost always done as shorter high intensity pieces or intervals.,Rowing,cwm1z0r,5,t5_2qljq

5971227,0,t3_3x84ic,While this will oversimplify a complex issue what people sometimes miss about steady state is that it only really makes sense in super high volume. I know its more complicated than this but in some ways steady state arises from the idea that your body cant handle  hours a week of high intensity erging.So I will go against the grain of this sub and say for many people starting out steady state is not necessarily the best option. This is because plenty of people want to do  hour long workouts a week. For those people I would argue that while steady state works theyd be better served with a different program. Steady states biggest advantage is that it allows you to effectively train your cardiovascular ability without wearing down your body. However if youre not erging  hours a week I think many would be better off pushing themselves with higher intensity pieces at least part of the time. Tldr the best workout for  hours a week is not necessarily the same workout as for  hours a week done half as long. ,Rowing,cy2cxfz,9,t5_2qljq

Yes your friends are likely correct no rower should be doing weights everyday let alone most days. At most I would aim for twice a week many programs forgo weights altogether and from what Ive read the evidence for doing them is equivocal.

If your rower can display the force curve of your stroke make sure it looks roughly like the left one here  Nothing is much more effective than what youre doing which is long steady state workouts punctuated occasionally by some speedwork or time tests. Keep up the work you can expect enormous gains in speed in your first  months of training. ,Rowing,czrietf,1,t5_2qljq
6517374,0,t3_44whsp,Do lots of steady state  min. Primarily erging although biking can work for getting back your heart rate up. Your k is pretty slow in comparison with your m time. Most people slow down by about  sec on the split for every doubling of the distance so k should be about  sec higher split than a m piece very approximately. Since yours is just under  seconds higher Im guessing youre flying and dying? Id say working on endurance should be your first priority rather than lifting. ,Rowing,cztg3wb,2,t5_2qljq

We all started somewhere and even if youre an endurance athlete in another capacity its hard to translate many other sports directly to rowing.Id worry less about your times right now than technique as uEt suggested and watch your improvement over time. People new to rowing usually make significant gains in strength and speed in the early months of dedicated training. There are plenty of exercises you can do but first and foremost Id suggest more rowing. Over time youll build a strong base and learn where your specific weaknesses are that may be holding you back. Dont just row ks of course. Read about steady state and learn to do longer pieces to train your body how to work effectively and master your technique.

The benefits of SS are many among them increasing capillary density increasing mitochondria count increasing the oxidative power of your mitochondria strengthening the heart muscle increasing cardiac output among many other benefits. Your body utilizes pyruvate from which lactic acid is produced as an energy source as well as other sugarsfats in your tissues. Your body produces lactate at all times  there is always a baseline level of lactic acid in your bloodstream even at rest. When you exercise at intensities beyond what your body can handle purely aerobically you produce more lactic acid. Some of it is consumed by your body for energy but as you continue to increase the intensity your production of it is higher than your consumption so the amount of lactic acid in your bloodstream increases and increases. ,Rowing,d1mjce3,5,t5_2qljq

7595744,0,t1_d35ex0a,Id say that a win at the Charles Belmont Stakes a US championship race Preakness and Henley Kentucky Derby would accurately reflect the variety found in the three legs of the American triple crown.The variety in distance is certainly greater than that found in horse racing. The shortest track is Preakness at   miles while our m race is the shortest of the lot. Henley is akin to the Kentucky derby at a slightly longer distance  and the presence of floppy hats. And coming back in the fall to win the Charles would seal the triple crown over m or so. Or the Charles is the first leg of the crown. I do think the physiology plays less of a difference in horse racing than you think it does.

Never mess with back injuries do your recovery properly follow your PTs word to the letter and dont short cut anything on the road to recovery.If you are uncomfortable with your current physical therapist think he is wrongcant fix the issue go find a new one in your area and consult him or find a chiropractor... I know a lot of people think chiropractors are voodoo magic lords that do nothing but they have a very advanced knowledge of the back in particular moreso than some PTs I have encountered so you might want to seek advice from a chiropractor as well as a secondary PT.good luck!,Rowing,d48fgx0,2,t5_2qljq

8336802,0,t3_4trg6u,I was recruited to row lightweight at Princeton and now do private recruitment advisement for rowers applying to colleges in my spare time. While I am not going to tell you about Georgetown because there is a lot of readily available information online I will tell you what you need to do if you are looking to be recruited.First know why you want to go to college. College is meant to prepare you for the real world and educate you for a desirable occupation. Maybe you know what field or fields youre interested in and can focus on colleges that have good programs for those fields. Maybe you dont really know and therefore WGWant a college with a board offering of different courses. Either way you need to know what you are trying to get out of college before you can start to pick the one that will work for you.Once we understand what we want next we have to see what our options are. So just like you would research a bunch of new products online before you picked one to buy you should look at what the colleges offer in terms of classes graduation requirements and extra curricular activities. This can easily be found online try searching Georgetown course offerings. Not only is this important for your own understanding but when you write your applications and email coaches you need to be able to tell them why their school is a good fit for you. If they see you have done the research and are excited about their school for the right reasons that will go a long way toward an accepted application.After your soul searching and college research write an email to the coach stating all your basic rowing information such as k PR heightweight and rowing accomplishments. You should then include why you are interested in that school. A coach wants athletes who will be a good academic fit as well because those rowers are more likely to row all four years and work hard for the team.From there it is all about dialog and further research. Talk to the coaches and ask questions. Try to get offical visits to the school. Then you can start narrowing down your choices and applying.Best of luck and if you have any questions feel free to reach out. I am always looking to take on new clients and do consultations both in person and online.,Rowing,d5jnktf,6,t5_2qljq

As a coach and a professional Im not going to give someone false hope if they physiologically cannot achieve what they are setting out to do.  Lifting weights is a great endeavor and the benefits of strength outside of size can be quite rewarding.  The end all be all is not necessarily getting bigger but getting stronger and faster. You are quite literally bashing me for offering the same advice as you except I explore a few crucial caveats that come with everyone trying to get big.  You are putting an extensive number of words in my mouth.   You have yet to refute the very valid point that within the first few months of resistance training anyone new to such training will see very little hypertrophy and a lot of neural adaptation.  Not only that but the hypertrophy that many people feel they are experiencing is simply a shift in body composition and the hypertrophy is simply better definition.Some individuals will quite literally not get big no matter how much you feed them or the RT protocol you put them on.

Try rowing in smaller boats x may be challenging especially since your first year of rowing in the single may not be succesfull medalling either. But  or  work well too. Also Wingspan legs and length is barely a problem. Look at the olympics this year Rasmus Quistlwt who even won gold in London looks like a dwarf. Mindaugas Griskonis is .m. Won silver in the Mx. Your erg score is definetely not horrible. And a s improvement is a lot. So yes you could defenitely make it to the olympics but it will require many years of work. I dont think you should focus on it in your nd year of rowing just set lower targets and after a few years you could think about a realistic Olympic participation.

8863581,0,t1_d77zlt7,That makes sense.  From what I see in your video it looks like the weight of your torso at the finish tends to come rest right on your lumbar area of the back just above the hips. This is because you get your full layback then you take the pressure off the oars and then after that start your recovery by bringing the body out of bow.You want to work on starting that reverse of the torso to start a bit earlier  work on trying to extract the blades while your arms are in that last little bit of squeeze but the torso has already reversed direction.  Think about squeezing the butt and punching the arms back to keep the torso muscle chain engaged and use the oars to not only finish the pull through the water but visualize using the oars to help pull your body out of bow.  All that weight of your torso every stroke is falling on your lower back  and at that point in the stroke is it not in a position to handle that load effectively which is what leads to the excessive lumbar muscle fatigue and opens the risk of injury.A good drill for that is the feetout finish drill. feet resting on top of the stretchers blades squared and buried with the handles about a foot away.  You want to pull into the body extract and come around with the arms away and torso in the catch position but legs stay down.,Rowing,d7da0g0,1,t5_2qljq

After warming up and before your main workout for the day do one of the pieces starting at m and going up.

9816839,0,t3_5fu3d5,Rowed throughout high school and college with ADD inattentive. Its radically different for everyone but I benefited from having lots of little strategies for shifting gears mentally throughout the day. First I tried to do as much homework before practice as possible because I knew that was when I would be the most productive. I always did my most difficult work during study halls or immediately after I got home from school. Saving the easiest stuff for after practice paid huge dividends.I also divided everything into small chunks. Whether it was homework or x steady state I broke long tasks into more mentally manageable pieces. I would focus on homeowork as best I could for  minutes and then take a twominute break to free my mind and then I would get back to work for  minutes. Similar on workouts  I would tell myself to focus on holding this split for  strokes and then worry about the next . Shifting rates helped a lot too even if it was just going back and forth between and  and a .Finally I take a minute to reset my mind whenever I transitioned between tasks. I know it sounds cliche but just taking a minute to empty my thoughts really helped. Sometimes I found a quiet place and other times I blasted music.

Id suggest take a max of ten hard strokes at the beginning to get it going from the start and then immediately get back to your goal split. The  meters should be an allout sprint.

11253990,0,t3_60kyno,I like green rubber. It might not allow the technically best grip but they keep their form much longer than the other materials. Once youve rowed with them for a few weeks the blisters stop coming up so much. They also have the advantage of being the cheapest.I liked the C blue foam grips when I used them but apparently they wear out pretty quickly.,Rowing,df7mflg,6,t5_2qljq

11362991,0,t1_dfjwv8i,Well in a good year i average  hours per week so nothing crazy. I guess i just found a pretty good fit for my physical capabilities in rowing. Of course moving a boat fast and an erg fast are two different things but i am hoping i could break  in a single scull in the next year or two but we shall see. Thats much harder than breaking  on an erg.But with work i usually wake up at am do a workout then after work at  i do a second workout. Weekends  workouts.,Rowing,dfjz1zq,2,t5_2qljq

Nice thing they give is three different time commitment levels short  min medium  min long Also a great YouTube channel is dark horse rowing for technique stuff. Id bet youre losing most of your efficiency in you leg drive so start with focusing on the ol legs gt back gt arms drills he talks about.  Exploding back fastermore consistently will probably get you an extra  second per  split. Just remember to time your recovery properly so you dont get gassed too quickly. ,Rowing,dgkde6a,2,t5_2qljq

This has been shown to not only deter the effects of lactate for longer but it has been shown to increase aerobic fitness as well. Example workouts are x  metres with  minutes rest x  metres with  minutes rest x  minutes with  minutes rest x  minutes with  minutes restFor anaerobic threshold training take  of your HRR and add it to your RHRHRR heart rate reserve  MHRmax heart rate minus RHRresting heart rateIf youre not willing to erg you wont get fast.,Rowing,dgv2si2,3,t5_2qljq
