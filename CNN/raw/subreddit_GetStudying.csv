If you want something a little less extreme you can go for the foam ones also. My issue with foams ones is that they are tougher to fit in your ear. But its ultimately up to personal preference. Another option you mentioned that you tried music is using a website like Pandora that plays like online radio. The music is always changing so you get bored less easily. I have a pair of noise canceling headphones that I use in the labs and simply plug into Pandora. The best channel that I have found to study to is Easy Listening. Its mostly classicalpiano songs.

303007,0,t1_cfc588a,I wouldnt say its a stupid thing to feel awkward about. ADD medications are wellknown for being abused. Its up to you to decide which is worse having ADD and not knowing it or not having ADD and having a doctor possibly think youre dodgy or even having ADD and having the doctor think youre dodgy. In all honestly though if youre doctors any good theyll approch it with seriousness and consideration not derision.  Maybe you could simply go in and mention your attention problems and things like that and not use the word ADD and see what they think?  If you do choose to see a professional to get assessed dont neglect to mention all the things that you feel cause you problems. When I first went in the general assumption by myself my GP and psychologist was that I had bipolar disorder. It was only because we mentioned all of the issues I had not just the ones we thought were relevent that the psychiatrist realised it was untreated ADD and associated depression and anxiety from having to deal with the problems stemming from it. The brain can be a complicated mess so everything you say can help them work out what the issue is.,GetStudying,cfc68n0,2,t5_2tl44

My school has that and it was the utmost useful resource I taken advantage of.Also many people told me this that its normal to have a lot of career changes.

654975,0,t1_cgepqqe,Well not for depression I meant studying wise I suppose. I feel like what I am doing now is not effective so Im not sure what to do. Well for chemistry I will skim the assigned readings first. Then I will mainly focus on the sample problems listed in the book and try to understand it. But honestly I have always struggled with chemistry and more often than not I barely understand what Im doing in the first place. I just try to do as many practice problems as I can but this takes an enormous amount of time because of my weak background in chemistry. I never get the problems right on the first try so I just try to do similar problems. For Biology I do the method listed in the original post. I cant think of any alternatives to rewriting notes though. I mean its time consuming but IF it will get me an A as opposed to getting Bs Im willing to put in the effort. I will do anything to get an A.Finally for other courses such as math I mainly just do lots of practice problems and reread my outlined notes for terminology. But to be completely honest I only study for biology most of the time and rarely put in time for chemistry and other subjects Im bad at managing my time because I learn so much slower. Like it takes me a long time just to read one page. If it takes  minutes for an average person to learn something it will take me  minutes. So I find myself studying for bio and then not having enough time in the day to study for anything else. Group studying? I honestly dont like it and I only reserve it for exams. I dislike it because everyone I study with gets distracted and the majority of people that I study with are much smarter than I am so they usually sit on their phones or play League of Legends and whatnot. So I end up getting distracted or talking about some useless crap that I could save for another date. I hope this can help you get a better understanding of what Im doing wrong like when you mentioned the issue in implementing my methods. ,GetStudying,cgepy98,1,t5_2tl44

Though I have a good feeling.Also my girlfriend rd year physics undergrad gave me a tip to look at questions and try to answer them before studying the lecture notes so that you know whats relevant and what you need to pay most attention to.The crucial thing you need to know about STEM subjects is that they are all about practice. Answering questions and solving them is the way to get shit done.Only so many questions can be asked over a topic and doing things like problems and past papers will make you remarkably faster and more confident and aids your exam technique. Also doing mock exams helps to take the edge off.Also try to get to know equations by playing with them. Stick simple numbers in and figure out what comes out.

2498044,0,t3_2o74dh,Here are a couple things I have learned that have helped me for science based research at least at the undergrad levelLearn how to use search terms properly ie. OR AND NOT  the database will usually have a help section for this or the library at your school can be VERY helpful and take the time to come up with key words. Finding a few relevant articles and taking key words from them can help to refine your search. Play around with the search use more specific or less specific terms depending on what you can find. Scan the references section of relevant articles you find and see if there is anything that sounds useful then look up those articles. Read the abstracts first!!! If the article looks good then scan it for the information you actually want. Dont waste time reading the whole article unless you think it really is going to be useful. Look for review articles meta analysis or systematic reviews for example. These can give you a good idea of the literature that is out there on your topic. A big mistake I used to make was to read any articles that looked remotely relevant because I couldnt find anything better. Now I spend more time searching and reading abstracts and being very picky about which articles I will actually read. If I cant find anything with the first search I tweak the search terms a bit and see what comes up. I used to hate having to search for articles but it comes easily now and Im sure it will for you too with a little practice! Hope this helps! ,GetStudying,cmkms9h,5,t5_2tl44

Unless youre dating a native speaker or have friends or family that are native speakers its going to be hard to practice. Ive learned several languages to a decent level by convincing friends to learn it with me and speaking with them whenever possible. To begin the process you need three main phrases in the language of intent that you can use so that the conversation stays in said language withou switching to English. That is paramount. These phrases are . How do you say something in language of intent . What does word mean in English . One moment I need to look that word up in my dictionary.    Use these phrases to stop yourself from sliding back into English. I taught my brother German using just those three phrases and now thats what we speak toge th er on a daily basis.

3012159,0,t3_2umyr0,First thing is to not compare yourself to others. There will always be someone better than you. Take pride in what you do. Whether you think you can or think you cant. Youre right. I too had to change my mindset when I went back to college. Youre not a horrible person it just sounds like you havent figured out how you learn. Two things which really helped me. First if you can teach it. Then you know it. This is a great way to find holes in what you know. You dont actually have to be teaching a person or living creature... My dog is a wiz in physics now. And my pillows know a lot of medical terminology.   I used to go over topics in my head and fool myself into thinking I knew it. If its straight rote memorization then I recommend color coding your flashcards. I dont mean aimlessly writing them in color. Actual word is always blue. Definition always red. Find what works for you. This helps me a lot but Im also a very visual learner. I will see answers for exams in color.Secondly reward yourself! It can be with anything which you enjoy. I change it up from time to time. Maybe its a few pieces of candy after a block of learning. Or a game of League of Legends after reading a chapter. You would be surprised how well this works over time. In essence youre conditioning yourself. Sometimes now I feel compelled to read before a game of league. Dont set yourself up to fail. Do  minutes of something and take a small break. I personally have ADHD so if I dont break up my time then Im beating a dead cat. But I imagine most people should break up their studying. The length at which they can sit for one session is the variable. But dont get me wrong. I have ment plenty of people that can sit for hours at a time and just digest it all. But if that isnt you dont do it.Think of studying as something fun. I personally love learning now as opposed to HS where I was a D student.

Then exp ix  cos x  sin x  isin x cos x  exp ix  cosx  isin x. The real and imaginary parts must be equal so that one equation tells you that cos x  cos x  sin x and also that sin xsin x cos x. Use cos x  sin x  to manipulate cos x if need be. Divide by cos to get the identity which involves tan and likewise for sin to get cot.Im in rd year and honestly that keeps me sane on exams.

Dont replace your friends or anything drastic just find a group that gets together to study that offers help and can keep you accountable. These people can be online  As an Australian I use ATARNotes Not sure about equivalents around the world though. If you manage to find a group make sure you contribute too. Youll learn more and generally enjoy studying that much more. If you cant find a group Im still happy to critique essays and discuss other classes if youd like  The most important thing for me is consistency. I study at least two of five classes every day plus at least an hour of Khan Academy On weekends and holidays it ends up anywhere between  hours school days usually only . Thing is with depression and the like is that you certainly wont feel like being consistent or probably doing anything at all. I struggled with it back a few years ago due to some family issues and ended up with an average attendance of two days a week and I didnt study at all its miraculous that I even passed. So obviously you need something to track how consistent you are and you need to stick to it  I use Habitica but I also recommend rtheXeffect or a good old tally system is just as good. Make sure you mix it up a bit too. I use a dice system to determine what Ill study if I cant think of something I really need to do. It looks like the following. Specialist Mathematics. Mathematical Methods. Literature. Classical Studies. Software Development. EdX Course None of the ones Im signed up for have started so this is currently a reroll  Dont commit to certain amounts of time  use tasks instead. I want to finish this chapter in Pride and Prejudice or today Im going to complete Exercise E for Specialist is far more productive than I will spend one hour reading and makes it a lot harder to say Oh well Ive done enough time to stop and just walk away without having done anything substansial. You should be able to say In todays study session I did this ... and I wont need to cover it again until ... a week is a good start. That being said start with baby steps. Dont decide youre going to complete the whole textbook in a week. Dont start with doing a whole chapter or even an exercise. Start with three questions. If you want to stop after that then stop. If you dont youll get frustrated. If you wouldnt mind continuing go right ahead. Anecdotally you dont want to be studying more than one topic in one session or youll find you cant recall as much. Its far better practice to take a five minute break if its from the same class or a ten minute break if its completely different podmoro system is good for this. Obviously doing every session as three questions for the rest of the academic year isnt really all that great better than nothing! so every three days in a row you manage that add another few questions. Dont ever get complacent with how much youre doing or how fast youre doing it.Study techniques vary from class to class obviously. Generally though practice questions are the best for maths and science? I cant confirm I dont do science these days. Flash cards Anki is great and has mobile linking although iOS is paid are good for sciences and generally anything that you have to remember a lot of isolated facts. Practice essays are the go to imo for English and other essay subjects. Best way to study is to actually do it though  people talk about ineffective study which is true is some regard but if you actually sit down and study you cant be learning less than you started with.Lastly As are meant to be achievable. Everything thats on any test you will do should be in the curriculum which is usually publicly available with some searching and if its not then theres something sketchy going on. What that means is that anyone that wants to get an A can do it. Youve proved you can before so you can do it now.As a piece of parting advice never ever avoid your teachers. Every teacher Ive had in highschool has been happy well relatively   to stay behind and talk for a few minutes whether its about the content or not. I know my th Grade Literature teachers birthday her sons name books shes interested in and what she plans to present in class before shes written the presentation because I was friendly and asked a lot of questions I promise no stalking. The more a teacher likes you the more likely they are to go out of their way to help you. This literature teacher mustve been marking at least a practice essay a week from me. Not to say you should befriend your teachers with the intent of using them or anything I found this out as a pleasant surprise as a result of being friends with her and applied it to my other classes. If youre uncomfortable talking to them in class or in person throw them an email. Teachers are notorious email addicts and often theyll get back to you within a few hours.Good luck!,GetStudying,cymblno,6,t5_2tl44

Its good to complete all of the assigned readings if you can before class take your own notes take inclass notes and then rewrite your notes. For more technicalsciencebased courses notecards can be a lifesaver. Stats recommend looking over your notes everyday for at least  minutes and rewrite class notes right after the class if possible. Also try to start studying about four days before your exam date its much better than cramming  In regards to your body image remember that everyone has different body types.

Theres so much toxic stuff on Facebook so much silly stuff so many people seeking attention so many advertisements from old friends.

Watching a series is a bad habit to get into especially when youre studying and when you dont have the discipline to control yourself. Yes you may be a good student you may perform well but you just need to lose track of what youre doing watch a few extra episodes and all that hard work will go down the drain. Is that worth it? Wouldnt it be better to watch the series during the holidays or at least limit to one episode a day?  Keeping track of all your courses and almost learning everyday doesnt make you a good student. Keeping track of the courses and modules and knowing whats going on whats due whats coming up thats all what a student is expected to do. Almost learning everyday? Almost learning? That means youre not really learning much. Thats bad. Even if we just listen in class we should always be learning something everyday. Why do you go to class and waste your time if youre not maximising your learning time? I try to put my best effort into learning in class because I want to spend less time learning something later which I could have already learnt in class.  None of us can help you with this.

Try changing your typical study routine dramatically and see if you get  better results. In the short term this is a little bit of extra work and it can be nerve racking but if you try new things and pay attention to the results  eventually youre going to figure out what works well for you. Thats a lesson that can stick with you for life. Youve already discovered at least one way of studying that doesnt produce the results you want.

I was raised with a fairly negative focus always being told what NOT to be what NOT to do. So when I went to university the first time my goal was to not fail out to not come out with a worthless degree etc etc. Long story short I failed out.A cornerstone of Maas guide is positive incremental goal setting. You start with a BIG goal and give it a date.  Then chunk it down into a couple of smaller goals with dates. Keep doing this until youre at manageable shortterm goals I want to make an A on this homework which is due on X day I want to have  of this vocabulary memorized by X time.A crucial part is adjusting these goals and dates. Maybe you overshoot and get all your vocab memorized by X time. Maybe you only made a B on the homework. So you need to adjust.But the root are real positive goals that you really actually want.Im happy to say that after making this change in  months Ill be graduating with honors from a tier  US university with a degree in Electrical Engineering.

Then go through the next section... and so on. Find any lectures or other material that might be useful to you ask your professor if he can recommend any resources he will know best after all. Most importantly find as many practice questions as you possibly can and do them all. Do as many practice exams as you can find and if you cant solve one just look it up in your notes or another resource. Prioritise trying to solve exam problems and just going back to your notes when you get stuck. Youll learn much quicker this way.Its all common sense really the way you learn to solve exam questions is by solving loads of exam questions. Cant get more simple than that.Another thing dont get stressed out or anything if you cant solve a question this is a GOOD thing. It means youve found a gap in your knowledge that you can fill finding them gaps is one of the hardest parts of learning.

In other words if you can find somewhere where the noise is balanced you will automatically filter it more efficiently than a library where its silent for  minutes then some couple decides to whisper or someone picks up their phone.

Im a Psych major and I have a problem filling out long papers because I tend to be really succinct.

Its going to depend a lot on your instructor how they structure their tests how specific and in depth their test towards and your ability to memorize versus just understand.My guess that its probable you wont BOMB the course if you dont know every little detail but depending on how zoomed in your professor wants to get it could very well be the difference between letter grades. When I took my schools intro to cell and molecular bio course as a freshman my instructor was notorious for her tendency to ask really specific questions about obscure facts mentioned once in lectures or in like sidenotespicture captions in the textbook.

As a freshman and sophomore I was addicted to gaming which tanked my grades and when I tried to redeem myself for the rest of junior and senior year I had to struggle with the issues you currently have. You can definitely work with ADD but you can also overcome it. It may sound extreme but developing skills to improve your attention span commitment efficiency etc will definitely help you in all parts of your life. What sucks is that tons of people go through what you do and never manage to get a handle on it.First off working in a bad environment is bad. Being in a loud busy distracting area is a nono and so is unrestrained access to entertainment. Sadly our homes tend to be poor places to study. If its ideal then thats a great advantage. Otherwise libraries are an awesome place to study and work on assignment after school.A lot of work is done online these days and that makes things especially worse for us with poor impulse control or lacking restraint. You need to exercise those skills however. It can be done and certain apps and programs exist to block distracting sites.
