8916115,0,t1_d7jjtor,gt Two thirds of the NCC voted to merge  therefore the majority of the leadership decided the merge was the best deal.By twothirds you mean two out of three people. Not to mention that the NCC does not hold the power to unilaterally merge the party with another party.gt Instead of waiting like we told you multiple times  the disgruntled Civics instead tried to VoC us out therefore forcing our hand for the sake of the party.A vote of confidence is the right of the party members according to the party Constitution and the Constitution of every other party as well. If you do not hold the partys confidence you have no authority to act for the sake of the party.gt Instead of people acting like they know what happened which wouldve been the case if I was able to be given time to aid my brother after a fucking car accident  how about we take the time to realize that the Civic party was merged w the libertarian party and once again let the effects take place.Rather than bullheadedly attempting to repeatedly state your opinion of the matter as fact refer to the above post of the Head Moderator for the actual fact. This decision is final and will not be revisited. The fact that two different reincarnations of the Civic Party featuring the vast majority of the former Civic Partys membership should speak for itself.,ModelUSMeta,d7jl4bu,5,t5_3blod
