8576297,0,t3_4x9q7m,Sorry you had a bad experience. Im sure that you are very frustrated.Honestly its difficult to take this post seriously and let me tell you why.Here you assert a fact. gtGot my package today. Nothing inside. Here you make needless speculation that doesnt even match other reports. gtWe all got fucked.Perhaps youre doing this due to your frustration? It doesnt help that you go on to say this gtBut at this point after shipping empty packages no one will every believe him again.Which is once again pure speculation that doesnt match reports as youre the only one so far who has reported receiving an empty package. If other people actually reported this then your statement might make sense or be useful information.Plus you dont discuss any effort to contact the vendor or any willingness to entertain the possibility that it could have been a mistake. It just seems like youre jumping to conclusions without putting any thought into it or giving them a chance to address it. I dont see how this helps anyone decide for themselves. Honestly it just comes across as slander.,testpost,d6dmc7n,1,t5_2rehl
