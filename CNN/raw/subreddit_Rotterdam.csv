926355,0,t1_ch98a49,Can second that. Lived here for  years now. Its a bit of a working city but its not superhard to make friends here and theres a pretty vibrant art scene as well.Housing here can be very affordable. Id recommend you look into the northern part of town although theres cheaper housing in Rotterdam South. For me that side of the river feels a bit disconnected from the city proper. Bergpolder and Blijdorp are pretty great places to live close to the center but relatively peaceful.,Rotterdam,ch9ky04,4,t5_2s7bc

7680332,0,t3_4kicb8,Nice to hear youre going to PRSPCT XL been there twice and had a great time.The location is what makes this party special its in the famous Maassilo venue which is a huge old factory and perfect for these kind of raves.gtWhere i am there are usually alot of troublemakers at dnb and hxc partys is it like that over there? Nope. Not at all in my experience. The atmosphere is usually very good!For some reason i NEVER had any problem with these kind of raves in rotterdam there is a far bigger chance to get into trouble when visiting normal clubs. Just be nice dont make any trouble and youll be fine.And lets be honest i think this is mainly because a lot of people are on drugs which makes the atmosphere even more unique imo. If youre doing anything dont get fucked up too hard or fast. Be sure to hide it well also inside the club there will be security guards walking around because drugs are still illegal.gtWhat are some must go places in rotterdam?If you like architecture there is a lot too see like the Markthal Erasmusbrug and Kop van Zuid.There are also a lot of quality restaurants with very tasty food.Some interesting areasWitte de With Lots of bars and restaurants  coffeeshops.Beurs City center with lots of shopping areas like Lijnbaan.Blaak More shops De Markthal and De Oude Haven which is an old harbor with lots of bars. If its sunny be sure to enjoy your beer there! The rest depends on your personal preferences i think you will find enough to do in the city center.gtIs it safe going arround the streets late at night?Yes never had any problems. Sometimes you see shady people but i never felt unsafe.Just stay in the busy areas and everything will be fine.Additional tipsWatch out when walking on those steep stairs in maassilo! ive seen people make nasty falls. I suggest going with public transport see .nl to plan everything because metro station Maashaven is literally right in front of the club. If youre searching for people you could try facebook or sites like partyflock.nl and djguide.nl,Rotterdam,d3f7hch,3,t5_2s7bc

10938413,0,t1_de7se9o,The Markthal is great indeed. I like V a lot too for food its a small ship in one of the inner harbors walking distance from Blaak and the Witte de Wit straat. They do English style food. Witte de Wit is a cool street to check out anyway a few good places to eat art galeries and coffee shops too.If youre into art I personally like the Booijmans van Beuningen museum a lot the photo museum across the Erasmus bridge is pretty good too. If you like cats theres a kattrncaf in the Hoogstraat thats really enjoyable basically get an organic snack and pet catsNot named so far recordshops Velvet Music near Eendrachtsplein is pretty good Platenboef is great forgot the street name but very central tooHave fun!,Rotterdam,de87ybg,2,t5_2s7bc
