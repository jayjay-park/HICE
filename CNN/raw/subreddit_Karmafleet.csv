2894488,0,t3_2ta11h,But what if anything did you do wrong. Or a better question what would you differently if when you find yourself in a similar situation?As long as your overview is set up correctly youre in the correct intel channel and you actively monitor both intel and local you MAY get away with getting away next time.  Also Directional Scanner is a great tool as it may indicate the direction theyre coming from so you can avoid heading towards them  Possibly.Hope youre having fun never stop doing what you enjoy doing and having fun.,Karmafleet,cnx3v2k,1,t5_35uri

3039612,0,t1_cod1ete,i think it all depends on how much you want to baby sit it. Ive done both methods and I prefer routing to storage bc when i route directly to launch pad i have login constantly and move shit to orbit. so i dunno but for a newbie wanting more grid i could see your way working for them.,Karmafleet,cod1ypl,1,t5_35uri

3281923,0,t3_2xpnfc,Having NPCs take gates would require more coding effort than CCP will be willing to devote I think. Even warping between grids is probably a huge change not sure about that one though.A big part of why EVE has worstinclass PVE content is because CCPs authoring tools and NPC behaviorscripting is complete shit. The stuff CCP has changed over the years like different target picking behavior is really a trivial change compared to having NPCs travel between grids and systems.Im not saying your suggestions are bad suggestions of course. Im just saying CCP probably cant do the required amount of coding to implement them.,Karmafleet,cp2d6wn,1,t5_35uri
3571553,0,t3_318g2q,gt how efficient is the JF service?GSF has the best JF service anywhere. Our primary service has been running for years through peace and war good times and bad without theft or loss.

5189903,0,t3_3m36u4,Welcome to Karmafleet.First off about FCing you can do it right away. Feel free to get on mumble and get some dudes together and go shoot the red guys. This is a great way to learn.Regarding salvaging and making isk there is so much ratting going on in Deklein that you will find that most guys dont bother with looting and salvaging their anomolies. Many of these guys will happily have you warp in after they have cleared the field and let you clean it all up. As for the Catbees name I havent got a clue.,Karmafleet,cvbkovc,2,t5_35uri

Hate to say it but were at war and there are a lot of people outside jita who would be happy to fuck you over war declerations mean they can shoot you and police wont care. Stay docked and read up on deathcloning over to our station in Saranen. Therell probably be people outside that station to wanting to murder you but therell be a few hundred of us standing by as well.If you havent come across them already theres a bunch of youtube videos in the new player megathread links that will walk you through it all.,Karmafleet,d3klf0o,1,t5_35uri
