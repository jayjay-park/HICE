2339346,0,t1_cm0ummx,I understand your point and it is a valid one. Although if I were you I would have simply printed the relevant charts myself   there is no great artistic value in them as it is right now. And I do recommend the expansions as well as at least the Wonders DLC  they definitely add a lot to the game  !,Civilization,cm0utjr,1,t5_2r3fi
