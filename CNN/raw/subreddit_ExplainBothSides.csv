11079876,1,t3_5y853f,Vegetarians I dont want to eat animals because it harms them because paying for their meat financially supports the companies that maintain their extremely cruel conditions. Also if we keep eating them well run out of resources a lot faster. Water arable land even carbon and methane emissions these are all dominated by animal agriculture. Its a bad industry which does bad things. Treats its employees like shit treats its animals like shit and quinoa is actually pretty dank tbh so theres no need famalam.Omnivores Bacon tastes good. Meat is traditional and I associate it with fond memories. Our ancestors ate meat its why we have such big brains! Lions eat meat are you going to stop them? We have sharp canine teeth because we are omnivores. Some people may be able to survive without meat but I have a job with manual labor and I need to stay strong. I also like to lift weights and theres no way I could get enough protein without meat. Vegetarians just want to force their incorrect opinions on everyone else.Bonus Veganarchist the industrial cruelty towards animals is no different than the slavery and abuse of humans carried out for the same purposes under any conditions where such exploitation can turn a profit. The machine exploits all and tortures all as is its nature and we must smash it. SMASH IT! SMASH IT NOOOOOOOOOW!,ExplainBothSides,denw6xa,0,t5_3jf35

11102050,0,t1_deq5der,Mine too! Perhaps the Yes side could possibly be stronger using at least one other argumentYes Although he is a rabbit unlike most flesh and bone rabbits in the ordinary world the kids inhabit the Trix rabbit is sentient.  As a sentient being he has inherent rights including a right to liberty and selfdetermination so long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.   There is no reason to think his consumption of Trix would unduly impinge on the rights of others.  Moreover because he is a cartoon rabbit there is no reason to think he has the metabolism of ordinary rabbits. ,ExplainBothSides,deqeotb,2,t5_3jf35
