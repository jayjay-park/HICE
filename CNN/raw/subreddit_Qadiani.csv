3964915,0,t1_cr823tp,gt Are you sure that narration is accurate? I have heard this story  times and every narration I have heard does not have Umar or others mention Isaas at all. He says The prophet is gone Like Musa as was gone for  days. I just googled and even wikipedia has this version of the story with references for their sources. Or do you think Umar compare the prophet to both Musaas AND Isaas? That would be a little contradictory as Musaas only left for a small period and came back. Isaas had been gone for hundreds of years so if the Prophet ascended just like Isaas did then Umar still would never have been able to see him again in his life and still be in grief.I didnt say whether it was accurate or not. The only reason I quoted the narration was because Mirza Ghulam Ahmad himself uses it to justify his claims. The narration is from alShahristani most probably an Ismaili in his book alMilal wal Nahl. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad uses the narration in Tuhfa Ghaznawiya p. Rohani Khazain vol. p.  In addition to the narration of Umar ra you pointed out there is another mentioned in IbnSad vol.  pg.  which goes as  gt The Messenger of Allah did not die. He is alive. He was struck by lightning like Moses. If anyone says Muhammad died I will split him into two with my sword.  Anyways it is good that you quoted the narration from Wikipedia. Here is the complete narration  gt He has not died but rather he has gone to his lord just as Moses went remaining absent from his people for forty nights after which he has returned to them. By Allah the messenger of Allah will indeed return just as Moses returned to his people and he will cut off the hands and legs of those men who claimed he Moosa has died Now compare this narration to the one quoted by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Umar ra is comparing the death of Muhammad saw to two incidents i.e. the raising of Essa as and the travel of Musa as. Whats common between the incident of Essa as and that of Musa as? Did Musa as travel to mount atTur spiritually? No Umar ra is using both of these examples to show that he believed Muhammad saw was taken on a physical journey.  Now the question arises as to why Umar ra and many other companions thought that Muhammad saw was taken on a physical journey when the body of the prophet saw was clearly visible.  The brief answer is shock and grief. They could not believe that the prophet saw had died. They felt death was not a befitting end for the messenger of Allah swt. There is a narration that mentions the state of Umar ra at this incident  Umar continued speaking till the edges of his mouth were filled with foam. Kanzul Ummal Hadith   Mirza Ghulam Ahmad too mentions Umars ra condition in his book Tuhfa Ghaznawiya p. Rohani Khazain vol. p. and said that  ...due to the sorrow he Umar was like the people who lose senses.  gt Your belief is actually much closer to Christian belief then mine. Both you and Christians are agreed that Isaas is alive in heaven in the flesh and will descend literally in the latter days. The Christians say that Isaas died on the cross was brought back to life and ascended while you say he never went on cross or died and ascended. It is not my belief. It is the Islamic belief. Logically it makes no sense that a person in  knew more about Essa as compared to the people who were closer to Muhammad saw.gt Both of our beliefs say that he did not die on the cross like the Christians say he did. If Isa never died on cross which we both agree Christian theology breaks down as the whole atonement doctrine is false.Yes Essa as didnt die on the cross but that is not why the Christian theology breaks down. The concept of atonement is false not because Essa as didnt die on the cross. It is false because Allah swt says so in Quran   Then Adam received from his Lord some words and He accepted his repentance. Indeed it is He who is the Accepting of repentance the Merciful.Adam as was forgiven for his sin. There is no original sin to atone for.,Qadiani,cr88fla,1,t5_35b5p

7587217,0,t1_d34lbf2,gtHe has explained several times in previous books that the reality haqiqat is that no prophet can come after the Holy Prophet Muhammad and so the words nabi or rasul are used for him in a metaphorical sense because of being a saint who receives revelation.gtTherefore wherever in the quotations that our Qadiani critics have given from HaqiqatulWahy the Promised Messiah has referred to himself as nabi or rasul it is only in the metaphorical way in which these titles can be applied to a mujaddid or muhaddas. This is our general answer to them.Basically they believe he is a Saint that gets revelation. I think theyve argued that he is a rasul but not a nabi but Ill have to look into that. As to get wahy the position of the scholars can be summed up by Shaykh Qazi AyazSimilarly anyone who claims to receive revelations even if he does not clearly claim prophethood... all such people are kafirAlso stating that Jesus peace be upon him died is clear kufr as it denies the clear statements of the Quran and the Lahoris follow their messiah in this as well,Qadiani,d34moa5,1,t5_35b5p
