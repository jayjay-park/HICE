3635466,0,t3_31zw1x,Aether Wing Kayle is such a great option for minor recolors. If you change her armor to black or a glossy Portalish white yoy can change her wingssword to any other color and it will look fantastic. That would only be with twotone options too. If they wanted Riot could really deck her out with a gundam or metroid sort of color scheme. I really hope they decide to work on her,ChromaRequest,cq6o5jv,1,t5_37r7e

3637264,0,t1_cq6u2y0,I couldnt make it any brighter than this without losing too much on the contrast and texture of the hair. You might be able to make it brighter but youd need more photoshop skills than me I only know the basics lolKatarina with lighter blue hair Images  and DDSI think what I might end up doing eventually is changing the loading screen splash icon in hud and adding the tattoo on her chest,ChromaRequest,cq6vivs,2,t5_37r7e
