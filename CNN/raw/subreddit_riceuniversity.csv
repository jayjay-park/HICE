4217755,0,t1_cs0kt5y,The other thing is that this law would not override campus policies already in place for students living on campus so far as I can tell. HampD would still be able to enforce the noweapons policy within the colleges as it already exists but this would allow off campus students faculty and staff to carry. On campus students would presumably be allowed to check handguns in at RUPD and collect them daily if they desired.Even if the bill passes Rice has a number of legal maneuvers it could use to prevent it from applying to the campus.,riceuniversity,cs109tb,2,t5_2s3mw
