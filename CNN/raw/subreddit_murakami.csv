I had to stretch the top and bottom to fit the size.Edit If you have an iPhone I moved the title down a bit so that it doesnt intersect with the clock on the lock screen ,murakami,cr42mdz,1,t5_2tdp4
4317552,0,t3_39f9kf,gtQ I just reread for the first time since it came outhad tried a few times before but always put it down after one or two hundred pages. I find it almost at times like a book written by someone who was trying to write like Murakami. It is also horribly repetitive although perhaps reading it in the space of a couple days doesnt help I did this both times. For whatever reason it keeps restating the same points over and over againlittle details about characters or things they are thinking or feeling. I dont mind a bit of this in books and I dont really mind the oftenraised complaint that his tropes come up time and again and its almost like he is just rewriting the same book.I believe Q was released in three separate volumes in Japanese but when translated was condensed into  novel.  As a result it feels like you are told the same information countless times and really ruins the flow of the piece.  I could be wrong however or they may have edited subsequent versions to fix this.,murakami,cscbdq8,2,t5_2tdp4

4583688,0,t3_3dqlko,Wow review copy  How exclusive... How do you qualify for that? Also looks pretty nice. In regards to the new translation I think its clear that Goossen was going off of Birnbaums. Theyre too similar to be coincidence. But I would say that Goossens is a big improvementmuch more clear. ,murakami,ct8diuf,1,t5_2tdp4

5449168,0,t1_cw7tkhg,gt I imagined Torus yard ending at the concrete wall at some stretch of it. In Chapter  he mentions crossing his yard and reaching the wall from it he could hear the phone ring in his home. Theres another scene where May climbs the wall into his yard. Oh I get it. Maybe I totally misread the descriptions but I thought the concrete wall was just part of Torus yard whereas his neighbours might have fences. Also just curious but how did May know where he lived...? ,murakami,cw86mjr,2,t5_2tdp4

5572642,0,t3_3rg9cl,My guess is that it is probably just another one of Murakamis themes. Its a cool thought though. Tell me if Im wrong but I think the only novels of his directly related are WindUp Bird and Q a certain character from windup appearing in the latter novel and the Rat seriesI bet if you asked Murakami himself hed say I dont know! ,murakami,cwnu69c,3,t5_2tdp4

7905395,0,t1_d42xsks,I watched Norwegian Wood before reading the book actually and the experience of both was pretty great still. I mean I can completely get a lot of it feeling bland but it came off more as his kind of mundane for me. I thought that the director carried the quiet introspection about as well as I think one could but thats really not something that films can do well.,murakami,d44n49z,2,t5_2tdp4

8809345,0,t3_4zyiyl,Coincidentally Im nearly done with my second reading of it myself. The first time as Ive noted on here many times I hated it and it turned me off Murakami. But now that Ive noticed all these strangely interlocking things I can see it in the context of the rest of Murakamis books. Its still not my favorite book of his but many of the things in this post help me appreciate it. Also may be worth buying a copy of it for that beautiful Knopf cover with the railway maps What do you think is the significance of the mechanical watch? I attach it to the way Tsukurus father named him in that the watch is a literal burden akin the alternate kanji for his name to create vs to build. But apparently Tsukuru continues to wind it anyway. Its a nice succinct symbol for the irony that fills his life dont you think?,murakami,d76rhei,1,t5_2tdp4

9599879,0,t3_5cghaa,I could see Norwegian Wood and Colorless Life being translated to slow paced tv dramas because in my opinion these stories are pretty straight cut stories.  Id hate to imagine how messed up some of my favorite abstract and magical elements in the other novels could get  through a screen adaptation.  Q could be an incredible anime though...,murakami,d9wdqkn,8,t5_2tdp4
