4363140,0,t3_31dzdi,I played with the picture a bit and got this. The nose bar on his glasses seems to become more apparent although that could just be the poor image quality and noise. His ears look rather strange too either they are very large and elongated or the top portion is hair. If it is hair it looks white. This would explain the insignia on his hat. The hat looks to be hair with weird lighting probably because of the camera flash the poor ambient lighting and that lit object to the left of the frame. The insignia looks white so this would support the white hair idea. He could be wearing a toboggan cap too. But Im no expert I could be and probably am wrong.Whowhatever heit is this is definitely a creepy photo for an old women to snap outside her home at night ,Humanoidencounters,cshgkuv,2,t5_31wuv
4421471,0,t1_csnzguq,I would maybe let out some pee.  Dont know about a peep.  It was just something I stumbled on down the youtube rabbit hole.

4545632,0,t3_3da38n,The beings in these encounters are always described as very angry when they are seen or discovered. I wonder if thats the actual emotion they feel an anthropocentric misinterpretation or if its just theater.But the NOOO in this story struck me as particularly interesting. I usually interpret the anger as some sort of rule being broken  like theyre not supposed to be seen and now theyll get in trouble. But this story made me take it a bit further. It seems like true despair over a more ultimate irreversible type of failure.Then I remembered an encounter I recently read in a Jacques Vallee book I cant recall which one but maybe someone here does. It was about a little humanoid who expressed such regret at being discovered because now it was trapped somehow in our reality having become fully corporeal or something due to being observed.Our conscious awareness or the awareness of certain people among us is more powerful than we know I think.,Humanoidencounters,ct3lpzb,10,t5_31wuv

These subtle or not so subtle references to Mandela Effect as we are socially experiencing it on the ground is not mere coincidence I think. CERN either knows something about whats going on regarding the Mandela Effects phenomenon and maybe other phenomena like ghosts but will not cannot? directly tell us.
