704055,0,t1_cgka04x,For some reason I feel like that is a fair way to handle the testing. In america you can use pretty much anything I think. Take a test on a  enduro and ride a busa the next week. Seems a bit counter intuitive. Over here you need to be endorsed to ride a bike but there are no restrictions if you have the full license. Lots of people die. ,bikesgonewild,cgkay3b,1,t5_2rne9
722565,0,t1_cgmdz4v,Its very light and not topheavy compared to other similar motorcycles Ive ridden. I came from a Yamaha cc YBR naked motorcycle and it took me about a minute riding it around my apartments garage to get used to the throttle and steering it at low speeds. That is to say its very easy to ride.On an open road its very torquey. If youre coming from a weaker bike or this is your first one you certainly will feel that kick when you accelerate. Its not as powerful as some other motorcycles Ive ridden but more than enough for a newcomer and powerful enough to put a smile even on an experience riders lips.It corners very well and holds a line quite nicely but if you hit a bump with your back wheel the back of the motorcycle can get slightly wobbly. This is something you can alter later if you like but its worth pointing out. Despite being a naked bike Ive never felt unstable on it even with heavy winds. While youll certainly feel the heavy winds on your body as theres very little on the motorcycle to block it the motorcycle itself maintains a nice clean course and is only altered by the winds very slightly.The seat is very comfortable and Ive ridden for hours on end without any issues at all.The brakes I have the ABS model are quite honestly excellent. Ive never felt the motorcycle slip on emergency brakes and on very poor road conditions its never let me down. You might hear some horror stories now and then about some people that prefer not to have ABS as sometimes the bike wont brake as much as you want it to in a critical situation but quite honestly if youre not riding at reckless speeds on poor terrain like an idiot I doubt youll have any issues at all.The top speed is a bit meh... Ive certainly ridden much faster motorcycles but it reaches about  of its top speed very quickly so despite not having a high speed ceiling the acceleration makes it easy to get up to your pace without losing much time which is definitely an advantage read its very fun.Fuel consumption is pretty impressive although they recommend premium fuel for it. In the end Im spending slightly more in fuel than I was with my cc but for the performance and security gains its more than worth it.The biggest nagging issue I have with the motorcycle is the exhaust pipe. Its too quiet. Behind a car in traffic people dont hear it and dont even know youre there until youre honking and cursing like a raging maniac when they almost read end you. At higher revs it does make a nicer sound but a low to mid revs it sounds some household device more than a motorcycle. So thats certainly a thing Im looking into upgrading very soon.If you get one I definitely recommend  getting the ABS model for the price difference its a steal. If you cant afford a Honda CBR with ABS just get the CBF with ABS. It will be about the same price as the CBR people wont look at you as if you have a death sentence tattood on your forehead as much and youll get just as much performance and slightly lower repair bills if you happen to drop it or ever have to take it to a maintenance that requires the removal of the fairings. If you get the Honda CBF get the red one. No its not race red its a slightly darker warmer shade of red that just looks luscious. I have seen very few pictures on the internet that give it justice but this one is very close,bikesgonewild,cgmeqkl,3,t5_2rne9

736111,0,t3_22iukr,Theres a couple of things you can do without spending a cent to fix the throttle snatch. Tune the TPS so it is not lagging. The mechanism can twist around a little just make sure you can still select a mode and you can also increase the CO setting for each cylinder in the dash management mode setting. Otherwise a reflash or power commander would help. Ive had mine since November and the more I ride it the more I like it nice buy well done. The red ones are always faster hey.

2071067,0,t1_cl32c0r,So I test rode the F  and  in  and early  as well as the Daytona R.I had never ridden anything but a vtwin Ducs and small Asian learner bikes before this. Both  Fs rode very poorly. It felt like there was some kind of bureaucratic government department in between you and the engine. It was delayed and sort of unpredictably jerky. I was really underwhelmed. The R felt very refined and smooth as youd expect.I decided against a bike in  and waited until early  post ? update for the MVs. Wow totally different in my opinion. Now I only took the  out twice for test rides so I didnt have the benefit of a few hours to develop a closer understanding but from my limited time with it it handled just like the  barring the obvious difference in the power band.Now as I said I came from a vtwin so I was looking for something that didnt completely lose that torquey feel and found a much better fit for myself in the . I dont think the two bikes are all that different however.Between the Daytona and the F Id say that the daytona is a track machine with predictable and elegant response whereas the F is still a bit Italian. Its now doing what they intend for it to do. If coming from an Asian or British bike I think Id call it a little more spirited which is much better or worse depending on your fancy.,bikesgonewild,cl32to5,3,t5_2rne9

3885514,0,t1_cqz3eqe,ASupermotos dont have skinny tires.B If group Hypermotos and things like a CBR GSXs or a ZRX in the same group the tem standard motorcycle has absolutely no meaning. Check cycleergo.com and compare the Hypermoto to the DRSM then try to find another bike with the same ergos as the hypermoto. You will find no standard that is as close as that Suzuki. These things are not just some dressup of a standard they are completely different creatures.C I wasnt implying that Brutales or Monsters were tortuous.

4191965,0,t1_cry2zkj,ampampamp Streetfighter sfw gtgtA streetfighter is a sport bike that is customized by removing the fairing and making other changes that result in an overall more aggressive look.   Beyond simply removing fairings specific changes that exemplify the streetfighter look are a pair of large round headlights tall upright handlebars such as those on a motocross bike and short loud lightweight mufflers. Streetfighters is also the name of a UK motorcycle magazine. gtLater streetfighters used custombuilt frames intended to overcome the weakness of the tubular steel frames of the early cylinder superbikes of the s and s. Many of these frames turned out to be beautifully crafted pieces of metallurgical art perhaps only unintentionally.  Many were also originally racing machines. gtMade popular by European riders  this type of custom motorcycle gained popularity all over the world and motorcycle manufacturers began responding in the late s by adopting the terminology  and producing factory built streetfighters beginning with the  Triumph Speed Triple  and the  Honda X  up through the  Ducati StreetfightergtgtImage from article iInteresting Ducati Streetfighter | Street Fighter III | Kawasaki Z Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcryzuf oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecryzuf.

It looks sounds amp rides sexy amp it just takes off the line so fast compared to everything else. Its adequate for riding two up but it seems like my girlfriend gets moved around a bit on it so when I brake she is pressing up against me amp we always have to readjust which I dont find so much on the other bikes. So the Shadow is great for that as well as throwing on some saddlebags which I feel just deprive the FZ of its good looks.I love the FZ but If you can only have one bike I might actually go for an NCx.

Theres never any excitement when you roll on the throttle its just like someones behind you and they push you a bit faster.But they are unapologetic big comfy classic cruisers and I can appreciate that and I like that there is a big difference in the feel between Indians and Victorys.

10510014,0,t1_dczelcg,Yeah same. Its because of US DOT regulations. The turn signals have to be a certain distance from each other. I dont know why they have to be so big and ugly though. I got pulled over in Staten Island NY just so that the cop can walk around my bike and inspect everything and he actually brought out a measuring tape to measure the distance between the signals. He asked where did I get them from and who put them on. I told him I bought them from the dealership and put them on myself. I think the fact that I got them from BMW in the US may have helped me not get a ticket. This specific cop was a jackass. I dont take my bike to Staten Island anymore unless I really really have to.,bikesgonewild,dczf6w8,1,t5_2rne9
