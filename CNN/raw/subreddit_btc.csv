5768539,0,t1_cxc4jbv,gtI see it as only users can create a push for more transactions. If miners want to include spam at extremely low fees then it could be a problem assuming for the sake of argument that MB blocks now would be a problem but why havent they been doing that up to now with all the empty blockspace up to MB?Im not sure the question addresses a real issue. BIP wouldnt be aiming to increase the limit if there wasnt some intention of going over it.MB isnt the real issue at hand there have been concerns raised over MB blocks however I wouldnt say theres any consensus about the actual impact. Theres more consensus about how high the limit goes into the future.Thats where your argument comes a bit more into play would the limit being high really affect anything?. I mean if there was no limit it wouldnt mean wed have infinitely huge blocks thatd be impossible.I know one issue is as block reward is reduced theres more incentive to include transactions to get as much from fees as possible. With a high limit the pool with the fastest connection would be at the greatest advantage as it could include enormous amounts of spam to reap the fees. Meanwhile when a  miner with a slower connection solves a block they dont even get as much in fees which may one day be a miners only income because if they spend time uploading a block they risk another pool solving the block as well. This effectively eliminates mining on home connections.With a lower limit if such a scenario happened users would likely pay higherfees for onchain transactions but with a lot more security IMO.I believe the main point here is there doesnt seem to be any actual proof that we need or could properly support significantly larger blocks safely right now.Edit BitcoinNG addresses the exact issue I outlined BTW.,btc,cxc52kn,0,t5_2si5v

That bigger blocks cause miner centralisation there are way bigger forces at play which cause centralisation not to mention that the market should be able to determine the level of centralisation its comfortable with vs. the accompanied growth.,btc,cxyjsil,1,t5_2si5v

There are some people who are incapable of admitting even obvious mistakes and these people defend their original mistakes up to a point where it is very ridiculous. These people dont see that it is the unability of performing sound judgement and of admitting own mistakes what damages their credibility and not their original mistakes as such remember that everybody makes mistakes but not everybody defends obvious mistakes until it becomes ridiculous.

Bitcoin is only useful to me if I can run a full validating node. Bitcoin is also only useful to me if I can get transactions onto the blockchain. And Bitcoin is only useful to me if it is decentralized.Because my biggest use case for Bitcoin is storing a portion of my savings divesting from fiat it would take a transaction price of  before its really not worth it to me. The small transactions I do make on Bitcoin I could live without.At about  important miners in the world Im basically on the edge of what I would consider sufficiently decentralized. Much more miner centralization and Im not going to be interested anymore.gt  And besides with more transactions in a block there will be more fees. Lets let the market set transaction fees rather than an arbitrary limit that forces transactions to fight with each other for block space. Its not about the fees. Its about the centralization and the trustlessness. Bitcoin is only interesting because it is decentralized and it is trustless. When you arent validating the chain Bitcoin is no longer trustless. When there are only  or  miners in the world that matter Bitcoin is no longer decentralized.gt So should we just give up then?Nobody is giving up. There are thousands upon thousands of thought hours and millions of research and development dollars going into finding ways to get Bitcoin to scale in a way that retains the trustlessness and the decentralization. Many of these advancements like lightning dont have anything to do with the block size. The vast majority of this research and development is being done by people who believe that small blocks are better because as it happens the best researched people tend to believe that small blocks are critically important to keeping the ecosystem alive.Toomim Andresen Hearn and Rizun are the exceptions. The vast majority of the remaining names agree that small blocks are a requirement for a decentralized Bitcoin and also agree that a hardfork should be executed carefully.gt Per his numbers it was more like MB today.Most researchers are okay with numbers like that. Thats why segwit at .mb is gaining acceptance among bitcoincore developers.The biggest thing that worries me is the idea that because the blocks are filling up we need to increase the block size. Thats equivalent to saying because Im late I must drive mph. If its not safe you have to accept the limitations that come with driving slower.Bitcoin cannot afford to increase the blocksize. Well lose the properties that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place.And if you disagree you should migrate to an altcoin that follows the paradigms you are happier with.

6136155,0,t1_cymvh58,This makes me wonder couldnt the current concerns about low node count actually be due to low blocksize? It seems to me that a miner trying to reduce orphan rate under a big blocks scenario would be setting up or paying for nodes around the world to either preferentially relay their blocks or just shore up the network in various pinch points that may be hindering the miners block propagation. For example say there was a miner in Antarctica that needed to route everything through New Zealand but there were few fast nodes there. New Zealand would effectively be a pinchpoint. If Im in New Zealand and have a fast connection why wouldnt this miner pay me to run a node from my house? The higher the orphan rate gets due to bigger blocks the more nodes miners would be willing to pay for thus keeping orphans under control and the node count high. In other words maybe we dont need nodes now for propagation because blocks are too small. Not too large. Someone will say node counts have fallen as blocks have gotten bigger but theres a huge reason in that it used to be required to run a node in order to use Bitcoin at all.As blocks get bigger some nodes would be knocked off the network but far more nodes would be incentivized into existence because miners will want to pay for them.

6152772,0,t3_3zo72i,I left some more comments on bitco.in. Im going to copypaste them in entirety. Hope thats not too much of a faux pasgt Hi folks. I dont usually watch this forum nothing against it  just not one of my habits so if anyone is interesting in helping the implementation of this they should contact me elsewhere and we can chat.gt I do intend to implement this myself if nobody else does but I dont have time to do it all myself right now.gt Id like the implementation of this feature to be as independent of the many locks in bitcoind especially csmain but also mempool.cs as possible. In order to minimize problems I think it will be a good idea to implement our own transaction cache outside of the purview of any main or mempool locksgt I also looked into SCTP but I think that since we can get the same data from multiple peers we should be using redundant requests of the same missing data from multiple peers. gt I also think theres a ton of cool stuff we could do with forward error correction so that it doesnt matter which packets get dropped as long as enough get through.gt I think that each peer connection should be implemented as a TCP connection for handshakecontrol information and little else in part to avoid some DoS scenarios especially being complicit in an amplification attack with a UDP port open for the actual data transfer. The TCP connection could be the standard bitcoind pp TCP but I think it would be preferable to have it be completely different.gt I expect each peer to be connected to a larger number of peers around  to  through this protocol in order to achieve optimal performance. The main pp protocol suffers from performance hits if the number of peers is too high due to the way blocks and transactions invs are broadcast to everyone with block uploads in parallel instead of series  That problem wont occur with blocktorrent and the invs are only one every  minutes instead of several per second.gt I also have some ideas for peer preference flags. A peer could volunteer himself as a miner optimize for early delivery to me please! supernode I have a lot of bandwidth and will upload a lot! or lowbandwidth user dont send me more than you have to and dont prioritize my latency!. gt Further options could be for whether it is permitted to start sending data without it being requested first and if so how much optimistic transmission limit. As a wellconnected miner I might be willing to accept  kB of data from you without asking it from you just to reduce latency. That should be enough to code a typical  MB block given the compression tools we have. If I tell all of my peers that I might end up getting . MB of data sent to me in total when a new block is published. That would be okay with me because it gives me the block  ms faster. Others might only be willing to accept about  kB optimistically  enough for the header and one intermediate level of the merkle tree. That saves on the number of round trips as from that point you just have to start requesting the descendants of those nodes in parallel from different peers.gt It will be very useful to have accurate information stored about what each peer has in their mempool. That way we can guess what transactions they have and dont have and volunteer some of the missing transactions. Bloom filters can be useful for this task. It could also be worthwhile and affordable to have a bitmap or boolean array for each peer to indicate which transactions they have. That might be easier to program with and more reliable than bloom filters. If you have  peers and you can keep track of mempools with up to k transactions that would require  MB of RAM. Probably affordable right? That bitmap could be populated by listening to each peers INV messages for transactions. This could be complicated by eviction policies though and would involve more interaction with the main mempool and pp code since you dont get INVs for txs over the blocktorrent ports and connections as I currently envision it. gt If we know that a peer has a tx for example we can identify it pretty reliably by just using the last  or  bytes of its hash. We can also check their other mempool txs to see if any other txs share the same hash. If they run into a collision that we dont expect very rare they can detect this and request the full tx hash either from us or from one of their other maybe lowerlatency peers. This means that we can usually encode a  MB block with  transactions using a bit more than  kB of traffic if the peer already has the transactions. Thanks to Felix Weis for this idea. If there is a hash collision which is easy to force we can detect it and request the full tx hash or the full tx. ,btc,cyp08hg,3,t5_2si5v

6317994,0,t1_cz7nn8g,I wrote the article. And you are correct it does place too much weight on that one slide. And let me tell you why it does. It is because LN proponents have been quoting that slide as gospel truth and spinning those numbers as the reason why we dont need a blocksize increase today.Realize that the reason RBF is being promoted is because core has a vision of a perpetual heavily backlogged state of the blockchain. So backlogged that no ones transaction gets processed in ten minutes. So backlogged that people will have hours if not days to keep resubmitting transactions to get their pending ones replaced. If this wasnt their vision then there would be no need for RBF. RBF has no purpose if the average confirmation time remains  minutes and the mempool backlog is regularly cleared.I think it is important that we call this stuff out. My vision of a working bitcoin network is an average confirmation time of ten minutes not hours and certainly not days.Bitcoin is being warped by core today based on the false assumptions in that slide.All that said I still think the LN shows great promise. I intend to have a conversation with the author and write a follow up article describing in realistic and practical terms how the LN could work for the average user.,btc,cz7sack,13,t5_2si5v

Now if the block size debate hadnt been such an enormous shitstorm that is pretty much on the tip of everyones tongue then making sure there is lots of lead time would be really important to make sure people upgrade before the changes take effect. But in this instance once the miners announce their intention to move over  weeks to maybe a month is probably enough warning for people. months to a year is just bullshitting the code for the changeover has been tested in XT a huge amount and I find it highly likely that the code for Classic is going to be even simpler. Of course the code for classic needs to be reviewed but  months is just ridiculous Id say  month max for reviewtesting and maybe even less if the changes are really small and simple. Then it simply comes down to how much lead time from miners announcing the switch to actually making the switch. As mentioned above that could be as soon as  weeks or maybe a month just to be safe as almost EVERYONE is keeping tabs on the blocksize issue. So from code release to changeover Id reckon  months if everything went smoothly.,btc,cza45lb,12,t5_2si5v

Ethereum has a fancy PoW designed to use ever increasing amounts of resources to compute which means it can run on reasonably recent GPUs today and would progressively price itself out of aging GPUs. Unfortunately its not going to be running for very long since Ethereum is scheduled to move to PoS within a year or so so we wont get to see the long term impact of that approach in the field.also its not clear that an ASICbased system couldnt just use upgradable memory slots to remain useful as long as compatible RAM sticks of higher capacity appear on the market.,btc,czd70ob,1,t5_2si5v

6506232,0,t3_44qvoz,It really does not matter what Blockstream or any other company does with respect to a NSL. What matters is what code you and the rest of the Bitcoin network runs as PP nodes. Bitcoin Core and probably Classic Unlimited have a mechanism called Gitian builds to which members of the community can build the source code in a controlled environment take a hash of the resulting binary and submit the result back to a repo for comparison with others builds under the same conditions. This means that if the source code is properly audited by people friendly to Bitcoin and if we trust the tool chain in the Gitian environment to compile a binary that free from nasty holes and if enough people check the hashes and ensure they are running the code that they expect to run then we should be fairly sure things are on the up and up. There are a lot of ifs there. The most likely scenario is that a bad actor will exploit a hole in the software that already exists Zero day exploit and use that until exposed. This is exactly what happened with the Tor Browser in   The overall solution to this is to get more people looking at the code running the code testing the code building the code under different environments trying to break the code.

6529730,0,t3_452gvl,Bitcoin is a ledger of transactions called blockchain combined with the network that spreads nodes amp extends miners this ledger. You can imagine blockchain as a book with transactions. The next page now is still empty but it follows the last full page of our book next block contains digest hash of the previous block. What will be in the next page?  Transactions AMOUNTOFBTC from X to Y  i.e. the transactions people want to make. You can imagine that those transactions came in separate envelopes.Who makes the next page?  One of the miners one who is lucky. It is sort of lottery  miner prepares the page next block with transactions she received from people amp then rolls a humongous dice as fast as she can miner picks random number adds it to the block computes hash  if the result is small enough under target which represents difficulty which is adapting to numberstrenght of miners the new page is recognized as the next valid page miner created additional valid block in blockchain. Once we have new valid page book with this page is copied to everybody anywhere on the planet block is propagated through the bitcoin network.Why is new block created like that?  Its a mechanism how everybody on the planet can agree what transactions took place i.e. they are recorded in the ledger bookblockchain. Creation of the new page block must be orders of magnitude slower than global propagation of the new updated book blockchain. Everybody on the planet has the same book the same ledger. It takes cca  minutes to create new block it takes cca  seconds to spread it around the globe.Who does this global propagation?  Bitcoin is a peer to peer network of nodes. Node is classiccore Bitcoin client running on a computer with inet connection that can receive and transactions and blocks and send those to other peers around  in our ledger book example nodes would be people and their printing presses who can create copies of envelopes with transactions and copies of the new page of the book or of the whole book and sendcarry it to their peers around. However  before transaction or page block is relayed to others it is checked if it complies to the rules no money created out of thin air etc..Who says what transaction or book page is correct?  There are rules written in the Bitcoin client that say how transactions and ledger book pages blockchain blocks must look like. If the new or any page in the book block in blockchain doesnt conform to rules it is discarded by the nodes as opposed to relayed to peers.Clear? ,btc,czuq4u1,2,t5_2si5v

Computing power is essentially free compared to the cost of energy and ASIC hardware.The real problem is inefficient network usage including howwhen verification is used unless one has an infinitely fast computer system.  Ideally the only limitation on block propagation should be speed of light.  There is absolutely no reason or necessity for schemes that store and forward complete blocks such that the propagation delay includes a factor blocksizehops.   In addition there are more complicated issues that depend on local knowledge and involve strategic decisions such as how many connections to neighbors to use and how to schedule transmission of new blocks most efficiently given limited transmission bandwidth and known receive bandwidth at ones neighbors.Given that the present algorithms used are not terribly efficient it is much more critical to improve these than to do bit bumming with the singular exception of the signature checking code which should have essentially all of its computation optimized for specific hardware architectures which probably means machine language for the inner loops. ,btc,czwrifg,1,t5_2si5v

So youd have had to sell everybody a gadget powerful enough to do crypto signatures and the gadgets would then have to use some sort of kludgey dialin to settle the payments.Sorry but I was there.  I started using the Internet in .  By the late s and early s the internet was already THE computer communications network although it was still limited to universities and companies public key cryptography was well known and the computers that people used at those places were quite capable of processing .But even if for you the internet is the public world wide web that is more than  years of furious internet development  and excitement about the potential of micropayments.  Yet there is still no successful use of micropayments.gt Also in suggesting perminute or perkb fees that suggests youre thinking of really old billing models. Nobodys going to charge per minute for a movie theyre going to charge permovie because now the cost of delivering the whole movie isnt much more than the cost of delivering  minute of the movie.That is not micropayments but pay per view an old concept that already exists and works as you point out.  So you are thinking of another problem entirely how to use bitcoin instead of ApplePay or PayPal to pay for digital files.

6601353,0,t1_d01wq1p,I should have been more specific. People running economic nodes talking about node counts mattering should also be willing to run this fork exclusively. Coinbase is a major wallet service that runs economic nodes  those nodes actually matter. They can run many types of nodes. If miners are to trigger the activation of any particular fork we can only run nodes based on that fork exclusively. Also if many miners leave Core there may be no going back if those Core devs decide to move onto other things because they think the miners have abandoned the project. There are still bugs and security issues to be fixed along with mining optimizations. Do we want to give that up? So it was amusing to me that someone in control of major economic nodes was pushing miners to change while not putting forth an equal commitment. ,btc,d024ubb,2,t5_2si5v

That means a high degree of custodial risk.  I cannot foresee how these hubs will not instantly fall under all kinds of bankinglaw scrutiny.  The idea that LN will result in a highspeed scalable decentralized network is utter balderdash.Oh by the way the entire LN network system at any moment in time exists as an interconnected web of zeroconf transactions.

If every race that he won was a race that someone else lost that means that everyone else would have suffered an average  point increase in orphan rates meaning that their expected revenue would only have been  of normal.On the other hand when blocks are found infrequently due to low hashrate on ppool the reward per block increases and the expected revenue does not drop. I would strongly prefer to have a small pool or even solo mine rather than have a pool in which rewards were distributed unequally.Even better would be if uhellobitcoinworld simply split up his hashrate among different nodes.

Development environment integration environment go thru regression testing testnet mining and get planned for the release. If theres single bug repeat it. Then theres  datacenters with tens of mining backends. Therere advanced workflows how to release new stratum backends because it is actually sensitive thing as some miners are poorly programmed and behave weird when they cannot reconnect to the pool during stratum reboots etc etc.So yes development and releasing new functionality into pool core got slower but for good.

6739594,0,t3_47zfzt,Delving into a world once shrouded in mystery this investigative report provides a fascinating account of the annual meetings of the worlds most powerful people The Bilderberg Group. Since first meeting in  at the Bilderberg Hotel in the Netherlands The Bilderberg Group has been comprised of prime ministers presidents and the wealthiest CEOs of the world all deliberating the economic and political future of humanity. The press has never attended these meetings which have ramifications on the citizens of the world. Using methods that resemble the spy tactics of the Cold War  and in several instances putting his own life on the line  the author managed to learn what was being said and has made it public for the first time.We have met the enemy and they are among us.This book examines and assesses the covert activities of the Bilderberg Group a Group which was founded and financed by David Rockefeller and the Rothschild banking empire in  and which took its name from the Hotel Bilderberg in Holland in which its first meeting was held and in which the initial members made their covenant and agreed to meet each following year.In attendance at that meeting were one hundred of the worlds wealthiest and most powerful men  all chosen on the basis of their common interests and shared beliefs which tended toward the elimination of nationalism national sovereignty and the creation of a World Bank a oneworld socialist government and a New World Order. They met at Rockefellers behest to debate analyze and plan the future of the world and these are the goals toward which the Bilderberg Group has striven from that day forward.This Group has been shielded from public view for almost its entire existence which is not surprising since the participants in this private enterprise own or control virtually all of the major news media and entertainment outlets in both the U.S. and Europe. As a result few Americans even know of its existence and far fewer have any idea what it is or what it stands for. That has been good for the Bilderbergers but not so good for you or for the sovereign nation in which you live. For whether you know it or not this covert group has changed your world and your life and will almost certainly create the world in which your children and grandchildren will live  and none of it for the better.,btc,d0gfk9a,15,t5_2si5v

6742410,0,t1_d0gofwi,Hey AminokI know you took a big down voting in the Bilderberg thread and I respect what you were doing there.   I think that avenue is a dubious position for the Bitcoin community to take and really wonder about that thread.  So thank you for that and I suspect that is the inspiration behind your post here and I agree with it.My charges of conflict of interest with Blockstream simply stem from this scaling situation.  I feel their resistance to onchain scaling is completely nontechnical and how they have communicated about it dishonest.  Their parade of technical excuses one after the other have been disproven or solved for the near term.  I feel their basic conflict is they dont want Bitcoin to scale on chain but want it moved into secondlayer solutions which is their business which is why they refuse to remove the  MB block limit.  This is the crux of the conflict in my opinion.  Beyond that and another piece I will address here I am not sure what conflicts exists right now besides perceived ones.To see how they would be driven from business motives in this regard I will provide a bunch of quotes and admittedly speculation.Check this article for some interesting quotes from the Core DevsFor instance CoralloYes I am arguing that by increasing the blocksize the incentives to actually make Bitcoin scale go away. Even if amazing technologies get built no one will have any reason to use them.Corallo admits scaling the BlockChain makes their products useless or much less useful.  Who will they sell them to if people can all just use the public Blockchain?  To me its a lot like Comcast not wanting a town to put in communitysupported fiber.  Thats an exaggeration but you get my point.  Bitcoin is great but lets leave it at  MB.  Or now lets just do segwit and leave it there.It seems to me Blockstream makes money by running these sidechains. Providing services based on them and supporting them.  Not inventing them or selling the code.  Keeping them open source is great and that is part of their business model and I respect that.  But why do people need to buy these side chain services from Blockstream if they can just use Bitcoin natively?  Corallo seems to agree and that article contains many more interesting quotes.Here are some quotes about their existing side chains not from the articleBTCC is very excited to be working with Blockstream to rollout this innovative application of sidechain technology. Liquid is both a practical application of sidechains that allows us to provide nearly instantaneous global interexchange transfers for our users as well as a major technical milestone that showcases the adaptability of Bitcoin. Samson Mow COO of BTCCThen from the Blockstream Liquid Press Release October  Blockstream in collaboration with an initial set of launch partners is excited to announce Liquid our first production sidechain. Liquid will improve capital efficiency and market liquidity by facilitating rapid and secure transfers between accounts held at any participating exchange or brokerage.Samson MowFrom December   News ArticleBlockPriority was developed to protect our customers from attacks on the network or confirmation delays because blocks are full Mow explained. But the other reason was to emphasize the blocksize issue. Although BlockPriority reduces the impact of the blocksize debate on BTCC and our users we still prefer a blocksize increase. Ideally there would be no need for BlockPriority.So here you have Mow and BTCC being customers of Blockstream implementing Liquid and then shortly after introducing BlockPriority.  So is BlockPriority Liquid or based on Liquid?Does BlockStream have a business model if everyone can just use the normal Bitcoin Blockchain to do their transactions?  Does it seem odd that Mow a business partner of Blockstream is also their vocal supporter on exclusively using the Core scaling roadmap and avoiding other alternative implementations which raise the block size?  This Core roadmap does not raise the block limit necessarily as it contains a lot of wiggle words about the hard fork.  Plus it pushes it to  and requires the consensus votes.  Segwit is an accounting change that seems to be something to enable side chains.  Segwit is actually a Blockstream Inc. invention and you can read about it in their press releases.  RBF is also something needed for side chains apparently.  These individual points can all be researched.  So it appears based on current expectations using the Core roadmap could potentially leave Bitcoin constrained for at least  more years at minimum.So in summary my problem with their conflict is the desire to keep the block chain limited.  I feel they have many conflicts in this one particular decision because their entire business model depends on not raising the limit.  They will make money by building selling and supporting these side chains which they are already starting to do.  And the block chain is already constrained.  And these side chains they currently have seem to give companies an advantage for when the normal Bitcoin block chain is full.  How much are they paying Blockstream for using these chains?  What is their real business model?  When are they expecting to be profitable?  What have they told the investors about this?They also seem to be motivated to build features into Core which enable their side chain business at the expense of other features.  To me this is another big conflict and we already see evidence with segwit and RBF.If the Core Development team were  other people independent of Blockstream and they decided to scale Bitcoin on chain things would be much different.  I dont feel I would have any problem here with Blockstream or who their investors are in that case.  Even if they submitted code to Core.  As long as it was reviewed and vetted by neutral people with no conflict of interest.So in summary I think Blockstream has an agenda to steer Bitcoin in one certain direction whereas users of Bitcoin have an agenda to steer it in the other direction.  Who is going to win?  Is the fox guarding the hen house?I hope this helps describe some of my concerns.  Again I agree we must temper our conspiracies as going down that road can inevitably lead to bad PR.  And I am not saying what I write here is  what is going on.  I am simply trying to give evidence as to why conflict of interest is important here.Hopefully this sheds some light on why I am concerned about it!,btc,d0gq11t,12,t5_2si5v
6743128,0,t3_480zo1,I assume that many nodes have DDOS protection. This may only make them resistant but does make it more difficult for someone to take those nodes down. I dont see anything that can be done to protect nodes on a global scale besides creating more nodes as DDOS is a very simple process. I wouldnt even call it a hack as it is just flooding spamming an ip addressnode from many other ipsnetworks.On a home network you arent going to have the availability of DDOS protection besides maybe through a VPN. I believe right now the fastest residential internet speed is  Gbs?The one thing many home networks do have as an advantage is dynamic IPs so they can change their IP if they notice they are getting DDOS attacked.I think this is of no big concern as anyone can pop up more nodes. ,btc,d0gsoyp,3,t5_2si5v

In an essentially zero sum game with more adopters of the currency i still cant imagine people would be ok with this concept. People with money will not invest or spend the money but rather remove it from the supply. By doing this as more adopters come along relative to the increase in supply based on population increase and the fact that the people who will essentially be poorer and poorer will have less thus making the currency for the rich more valuable.

Thats all irrelevant right now. We cant talk about which plan is right if we cant even have a say as to what plan is rolled out. Core has a death grip on bitcoin right now. Classic seems like the most reasonable step in a direction where the community can have more involvement in the process. I dont agree with Classic on many things but they are petty in comparison to the problems associated with Core. I personally advocate for a separation of development for mining software and node software. The nodes should function as a barrier to bad mining practices. Miners should run software which optimizes their profits. The resulting network will have a natural balance. Central economic planners is a very bad idea. If you run a node run Bitcoin Unlimited. If you are mining run Classic. In the future I hope to see even more diversity to fill various roles in the network. Blockstream can then be free to run their services on top of this network.

6889962,0,t1_d0x623n,I did a bunch of the due diligence on making this happen. My first approach was to just add additional alert keys and I wrote some code to do that but on testing it can lead to nodes getting banned by nodes that dont recognize the key.I went back and rethought it even got as far a writing an unpublished BIP on how to rewrite the alert system so alert keys were individually assigned and could be added and removed in the future without requiring a new release or configuration changes.But the Tldr is that whether you change the existing alert system or deploy a new one in parallel.  You need a super majority of the nodes supporting your new system before you send alerts on it reliably.  Otherwise the alerts can die at nodes that dont recognize them.All of which can be done of course but for now unless core is on board with changing things classic cant change it on its own.There already exists a way to quickly limit the harm someone could do if they try to abuse the existing alert key. Anyone with the alert key already knows this. The risk is not as great as it sounds.

You should know I appreciate your work but I think weve all been a bit distracted by minutia.My opinion based on some engineering experience and my open source philosophy is that you guys need to just keep pushing in quality code and let the chips fall as they may in terms of  vs MB. In fact it would further your goals to just fork to MB to enhance confidence in the space and keep pushing in your sick innovations. I desperately want to use the code you guys are working on once its the best user experience proliferating a new era of finance  years from now. But I think youre wrong that vastly refactoring the way transactions are processed and potentially swaying the game theory of the types of onchain transactions with whatever unforeseen side effects neither of us are smart enough to know is the best way to proceed across the next  months. Im sorry Dr. but I think youre wrong.The fact is that if Segregated Witness is so nice and it is in terms of a robust bitcoin but when implemented quickly as a clunky short term scaling solution it is not so nice then people will upgrade their code to use it.

6964083,0,t3_4b2tee,The LN seems to be just the theoretical version of  vaporware at this point.  Proponents know what they would like it to do but still have no viable design that would actually do that.This comment and the following discussion mentions some of the unsolved problems of the design.A more general problem is the possibility that the LN checks the unconfirmed and unbroadcast transactions that LN users are holding may become invalid before they can be cashed because of changes in the protocol  even softforked changes that could be implemented by any set of miners with a simple majority of the hashpowerFor example a simple and likely softforked change would be an increase in the minimum fee.  Such a change could invalidate many checks that having been issued with older wallets failed to include sufficient fees.  As long as the minimum fee is only enforced by the relay nodes this particular problem could be solved if the nodes implement the childpaysforparent CPFP policy. Namely when a receiving party decides to close a payment channel he broadcasts the final check T then issues another transaction T that moves the output of T to another address with enough fee to pay for T and T.  But it is not certain that T can get to through the nodes before the channel expires.  Moreover if the minimum fee is enforced by the miners as a validity rule CPFP will not work and T will never be included.Workarounds may be harder for other protocol changes even softforked ones.  For example after the BIP softfork change was enabled last July certain variations in the signatures became invalid.  Suppose that a valid transaction T was created before that date signed using one of those variations but was not broadcast.  After the fork T would be invalid and would never be confirmed.  In that case perhaps the signatures could still be malleated even without access to the private keys to use the accepted variation.  But other rule changes could be impossible to work around.  For instance if T has a . BTC return change output and the new rules impose a minimum output size of . BTC as an antispam measure there would be no way to fix T to make it valid without access to the private key of the other channel party.,btc,d15pqam,14,t5_2si5v

For the last few years the routers in between have been trying to block sending the same UDP or derived packet again saying fuck you I already forwarded this. With RBF the sender now has the possibility to announce in the first UDP packet this might not be the last please allow further updates and then routers will disable that blocking behaviour if fee is sufficient etc..The end user doesnt really see that a transaction failed theres only the absence of a confirmation. Like the DNS lookup that a browser does when you go to www.google.com theres a delay but the browser doesnt know what happened. After a decent timeout the browser will send another UDP packet to try again. Configuration will determine how long and how often the browser will keep trying until it gives up.You cant do better than that anyway because there is always a chance that a transaction simply doesnt get confirmed ever low fee invalid transaction the node youre sending the transaction to is censoring you miners are censoring you... and there is no feedback mechanism that can tell you what happened all the information you get is confirmation if success and nothing otherwise. No error message no pointer to the source of the problem nothing.gt There would be a valid analogy if RBF automatically fixed transactions with insufficient feesIts not the job of RBF to do that its the client that needs to implement that.

6999051,0,t1_d19nwrv,gt I guess I just dont see how increasing the block size can be avoided.It doesnt have to be avoided. But there are concerns regarding node and miner centralization caused by increased bandwidth load and relay delays. These concerns are being mitigated by Core  . made huge gains in throttling bandwidth for node operators for instance. The idea is to make the pp protocol more scalable first to mitigate the negative impacts of increased block size on nodes and smaller miners. Very few if any Core developers hold the position that block size should never be increased.gt SegWit is not a real scaling solution. Efficiency is only a small short term scaling solution. Increasing the block size is a safe and easy solution it seems.Segwit is a scaling solution but only a shortterm one. It mitigates the negative impacts on nonupdated nodes now so that we can increase capacity in the interim as progress is made on weak blocks IBLTs and LN to address longer term capacity needs. Increasing the block size isnt really a solution as it doesnt do anything to scale throughput.gt The strange idea that increasing the block size could hurt decentralisation makes no sense. Especially when things are currently becoming centralised by those forcing the small block size limit.How so? Upload bandwidth requirements are directly related to block size therefore increased block size directly and negatively impacts nodes. Decentralization in this context  the existence of a distributed network of nodes. Squeeze them out by perpetually increasing network load i.e. increasing block size without scaling and they are centralized into a smaller and smaller network. gt Considering how early of a phase we are in with cryptocurrency hurting early apodters could have a vastly negative effect long term.Prematurely hard forking without widespread consensus will indeed hurt early adopters. Thats why most early adopters like me arent interested in these fear mongering arguments. We have significant long term money invested and do not appreciate attempts to change the rules without our agreement.gt It wold likely case centralisation as Blockchain technology would likely become a tool for banking infrastructure and not a decentralised system that it is now.That is not clear at all.

Increasing the fee will reduce the probability for the transaction to time out but one can never be guaranteed against it.  Pay significantly more than the best estimate and one can be reasonably sure that the transaction will confirm within two blocks ... but pay the estimate for what is needed to be included within  blocks and the probability that the transaction still wont be confirmed after  hours is significant.For onchain realtime transaction i.e. coffee sales one needs it to be free capacity at least on a daily basis to be really sure the transaction will get through.The current corementality is that bitcoins are not supposed to be used for buying coffee that nonconfirmed transactions were never designed to be safe  that RBF is the solution against stuck transactions and that lightning is the solution for buying coffee.Im inclined to believe that we will need to move in that direction in the long term.  However lightning is so far just vaporware and Bitcoin is no real currency if one cant use it for buying coffee.

The Chinese miners rarely communicate with the outside world they do not care about the development of the system few people really understand the status of Bitcoin it is equal to all power to the mining pool so the core is under control of several major mining pools that brought under control Bitcoin no matter how good your classic usage is for this situation how are you going to fix it?To see the situation from this expansion do you think Bitcoin development of a big problem the center of the case if there are developers?

Falsify a theory once...Here in Bitcoin you have at least the field economy as one of the softer sciences included and you are going to say it is scientifically settled?Give me a break.The socalled scalability issues in Bitcoin havent even been clearly defined yet!Scientific is a big word you used for effect here but not for furthering honest discussion.,btc,d2e116l,7,t5_2si5v
7356106,0,t1_d2eb902,I was initially hopeful a year or so ago that if the users overwhelmingly agreed that Bitcoin needed larger blocks they could make it happen. In the time since it has become clear to me that the Core team has built such a solid reputation that it cannot be overcome without a great deal more support than we are seeing for larger blocks.Not sure what you mean by rendering nodes defunct  you mean via a soft fork? Weve been doing soft forks for years. If you mean that nodes wont see LN transactions thats kind of the point  they are validating the transactions on their way into and out of the LN.As someone who monitors the network every day Ive surprisingly not seen as many problems as I expected. Fees havent gone up as much as I expected nor have backlogs become as bad as I expected. My issue is that theres no way for us to tell if this is because people have stopped using Bitcoin as a result of some of the periods of high contention for block space. From what Ive seen interacting with our high volume users at BitGo they dont appear to be affected  they continue making transactions in many cases for low amounts and the fee bumps havent yet made their businesses unprofitable. As such I see claims of bitcoin being damaged to be speculative without more proof.,btc,d2ec7n7,11,t5_2si5v
7363071,0,t1_d2eydyl,Except that as a majority cartel they can impose that as a rule  that is they can reject and orphan any block by a competitor that tries to undercut their chosen fees.  That would be a softfork rule hence it can be imposed unilaterally by a simple majority of the miners whether users like it or not.Even if they did not do that but just applied the new fee policy to their own blocks it would mean a  minute confirmation wait for clients who do not pay their fees. Whether the rise is worth or not would then depend on the percentage P of clients who would rather pay than wait.  I did the algebra here on reddit many months ago...No amount of arguing can make the current mining scenario seem less than catstrophic.  Satoshi DID write in the whitepaper The system is secure as long as honest nodes  miners collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.Those few top miners the Chinese giants plus BitFury have already used their cartel power when they decided to vote against BIP and other limitincreasing proposals and support Core.  Recall that they did so after the meeting in Hong Kong with Adam Back and other Blockstream staff and contractors reversing their previous written statement approving a  MB limit.  In Satoshis vision that meeting and the miners pledge that came out of it should have been impossible.,btc,d2f4py2,1,t5_2si5v

Some money will always be cleaner then others and if people start asking for it tiring of hackers and scammer stealing cryptocurrencies you will end up with wallets that take taint into account and treat those coins as reduced in value.If you want a cryptocurrency that is completely fungible untrackable but in everyway like bitcoin there is Monero.

7410208,0,t1_d2jldka,One does not buy or sell futures contracts using leverage the way you might for stocks or bitcoin where x leverage is not uncommon. On a futures market you buy and sell futures contracts for a small fixed fee.The futures contract obligates you buy or sell the underlying asset in this case bitcoin on a specific date in the future. This is called taking delivery. And it rarely actually happens because the the difference between the current price and the contracts price is settled on a daily basis.You can think of a futures contract as an agreement to payreceive the daily profit or loss on the theoretical position resulting from a theoretical trade.Margin in the world of futures is just a minimum balance that you agree to keep in your account as the difference in price is settled each day causing actual money to move between accounts. This has nothing to do with leverage.So when there is a large margin call no one at the exchange is celebrating because the exchange only makes money on the fee charged for the contract not on the movement of the price of the underlying asset i.e. bitcoin.Please be careful not to amplify misinformation for the sake of an agenda or opinion.

You cant have  related features tested completely independently and causing no issues brought together and then assume that they will just work. The testing has to be done on the whole.  If you ever compiled the Bitcoin client yourself you know you go through a configure screen that produces so much text that nobody reads it. This text finds stuff that bitcoin depends on. Turning off features if a certain library is missing etc.Practically all the people doing selfcompiles will end up building a version of bitcoin that is not the same as the one that will be released. Practically nobody uses exactly the same boost library and the same options for instance. And as such will be testing something that may or may not trigger bugs in the same was as the official release will.During the months leading up to the release the  lines of code were added. Some of them written well before that date but all of them integrated and updated until shortly before the ReleaseCandidate was created. days after the release candidate was created the final release was created marking the code stable.It wasnt tested because there was no time to test it.

7551900,0,t1_d30lmmw,Good catch I must admit.So you are in some sense right on that point.The only thing is We have ample evidence that the CEO of AXA is Chairman Bilderberg Group and that a venturecapital fund of AXA is one of Blockstreams major funders.So thats an obvious conflictofinterest which they should but do not address.Meanwhile the frequent accusations we see around here of random redditors being paid off or shills are made with zero evidence.Now I personally do believe that many redditors are paid off or shills.But since its impossible to know who is and who isnt I have never made that sort of accusation  since it just goes nowhere its pure speculation.The most I can do in my case is suggest Occams Razor What would be the simplest explanation of why I might support somewhatbigger blocks? As a person who is involved with Bitcoin and presumably wants to see it succeed there could be many explanations the simplest being the ones I have stated I believe that the market needs bigger blocks and the hardware  infrastructure supports it. And I know that blocks have gotten bigger and price has gotten higher. So the simplest explanation about someone like me is I want Bitcoin to succeed.But as I said we do know that the CEO of AXA is Chairman Bilderberg Group and that a venturecapital fund of AXA is one of Blockstreams major funders.And we know that many Bilderbergers or guys like Jamie Dimon do not want Bitcoin to succeed.Ultimately we should evaluate peoples arguments.Aside from whatever influence the Bilderberger Group may or may not have on Blockstream  it is reasonable to believe that the Bitcoin market needs bigger blocks in order to provide enough capacity for increased adoption  volume the Bitcoin network can support bigger blocks using the existing hardware  infrastructureThese assertions are obvious to many people  and do not depend on who is saying them.And I think it is important for people to konw that the chairmain of the Bilderberg Group the CEO of one of the companies whose venturecapital arm is funding Blockstream.You cannot call me hypocritical for pointing out that objective fact.And the burden of proof should be on Blockstream to prove that they are not being influenced by AXA or the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group to steer Bitcoin development in any particular direction.Given the fact that Blockstream is steering Bitcoin development in the wrong direction only makes it more important for them to prove that.Probably the best argument supporting the assertion that I in particular am not paid off or a shill is Most shills are lazy and are not very good writers. They prefer to engage in driveby snark  which I never do. My posts are long and passionate and wellthought out  characteristics which as far as I am able to guess most paidoff shills posts do not exhibit.Meanwhile I welcome the accusation  because in the end I think its actually a compliment it means that my writing is effective.By the way I read that article in the New York Times a few years ago about the Kremlin troll factoryI read that story with great interest  and relief that I have been blessed with enough skills to never have to stoop to such a dreary probably quite lowpaying career.So I would think that to some degree the mere fact that I can write as effectively I do whether or not you happen to agree with me would suggest to the curious onlooker that I might possibly have the option of doing work a bit more dignified and probably much more highly remunerated than being a paidoff shill.In other words paidoff shills are usually pretty dumb.

Each miner decides which transactions to include by any criterion whatsoever.   Each miner decides whether to use a block solved by another miner as a parent of his next block.This was supposed to work provided that a majority of the mining power belonged to many selfish independent miners.  With that design in particular there would be no need for fee estimation algorithms.  If a transaction in the opinion of most miners paid enough fee to cover its processing costs it would be confirmed almost certainly in the next block.  There would be no reason for clients to pay bribes through alternate channels and even if they did it would not make any difference to the other clients  their transactions with standard fees would still be confoirmed in the next block.But that was Satoshis  design.

Because no matter how many pay the fee there isnt enough space in the block.  If you exclude the fee entirely your transaction may or may not be picked up.   That is the design of Bitcoin..But a bidding war will increase capacity zero.   That problem only exists because the core team refuses to remove the artificial limit.  No amount of fees will create extra capacity to carry the transactions to their conclusion because the cause of the lack of capacity is code not bandwidth CPU or anything that can be bought.  If larger blocks where just a pain in the miners side and required more infrastructure investment then increased fees could compensate them for providing the excess capacity.  ,btc,d3c6wqq,2,t5_2si5v

So if nd layer networks increase capacity without fees ever rising too dramatically and the price just goes up because Bitcoin becomes infinitely more usable in the retail space as a result of the nd layer being instant and not having malleability issues and anonymity is increased at the same time then youll just give up on support for bigger blocks?

It only happens rarely and typically with much bloodshed Magna Carta US war of independence and often the outcome of such strife is decreasing liberty French revolution.

7944354,0,t1_d48rqi6,On the contrary most of the design of bitcoin is actually quite simple and obvious. Thats why bitcoin works as well as it does.To the extent that Bitcoin is not simple it is because of technical debt.  Much of this is in the details of transactions and how signatures   and TXIDs are attached to transactions.  In particular the signatures are included in the transaction ID when there is no good reason to do this.  Also the binding is such that ON hashes are needed for large transactions for no good reason.  Both of these problems are design problems that have been in bitcoin since the beginning and have been known for years.  There is no damned excuse for letting this technical debt fester for years.  We see that the method being chosen by the presently dominant faction of Bitcoin is to solve this problem in an overly complex fashion thereby adding more technical debt.That intelligent people are still confused about these technical details speaks ill of the developers especially those who claim to be technical leaders.  These people cant explain simple things in a simple way let alone make complicated things simple. They have difficulty writing clear and unambiguous reddit posts preferring instead to be ambiguous and inflating their own ego by thinking that other people are stupid who reply where the confusion comes from the ambiguity in the original posting.All of this could be forgiven if they were polite and nice.,btc,d490puq,3,t5_2si5v

The hundred and fifty who cant get the train stop planning to take the train and use busses planes cars bicycles rollerskates cartwheels ubers and these stupid things Then since the majority of people remember having a bad time with the train they stop even trying to wait at the station. To literalize my example people use trains for intercity transport in Europe because they can rely on it. There are options including perhaps the best highway system in the world referring to the Autobahn. In other places such as India there are no other comparable options and the train is miserably packed because it is basically the only good option to move oneself across land. But with sending wealth to another person or business people will use Apple Pay PayPal Google Wallet or whatever crappy bankrun instant funding option they have if the train remains full.

7971904,0,t1_d4bpyn6,gt As far as fees goes the fee auction system was implemented and designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. He wanted to preserve no fees while there wasnt much activity but he indicated that as activity grew that clients could start to auto detect the necessity of fees. So the idea of adding fees is credited to himThat is absolutely NOT TRUE.  Satoshi always assumed that the miners would set their fees but block space would be unlimited.  He never suggested in the whitepaper or anywhere else that clients would have to compete for artificially scarce block space.  Any transaction that paid the minimum fee  enough to motivate the miners  would be included in the next mined block. When the  MB block limit was introduced as a safety measure it was  times or so larger than the average block size.   Just before leaving the scene Satoshi described how it should be raised when needed.  Namely there woudl be no need to carry out a vote since no one could object to fixing a bug!.  If would suffice to introduce the new limit in the code a few months before its activation and warn all clients of the need to update i that interval.AFAIK the idea of the fee market  forcing users to compete in a semiblind auction for limited block space  was proposed by Greg in  and would have been ignored if it was not for Blockstream and Vladimirs idea of consensus. ,btc,d4c48gk,1,t5_2si5v

Decentralized investment is mostly dead in Bitcoin because the almost all thing. Almost all of them were scams. Bitcoiners learned early.gt Ive been in startups for quite a while and got involved with many in the cryptocurrency space. AM did what it can pretty well and it protected Bitcoin from potential attacks until competitors began to behave.It did not. The centralized nature of its hashrate created an easy early target for attackers. It was a massive centralizing force and began the race to the bottom of that particular barrel. Additionally by lying to its investors about what it was going to do with our money it in my opinion fraudulently capitalized its early mining ventures. Kind of like KnC.gt To me it is magical that people could fund it and they could deliver. You will not have better than that but Ill leave that there for you to consider in your future enterprises.So what? Avalon did the same thing and did it in a way which was far more compatible with Bitcoin decentralization ideals. How did they manage it? AM just saw a profit opportunity and correctly guessed that by paying people chunks of bitcoin nobody would complain or call them on it.gt Obviously. My point badly delivered sorry was that it is trivial to leak data if you do not block clear Internet traffic.Okay sure. But thats irrelevant. This scenario is the bad one I am currently not leaking privacy. I upgraded to a bitcoind with that patch. I am now unknowingly leaking privacy.That is completely undocumented new behaviour which leaked privacy arrived in that patch and when people pointed it out as far as I can tell Hearn just stubbornly refused to fix it.gt You are talking as if I claimed downloading the list was a good idea even though Im just saying that it is not a sinister antiprivacy feature that amounts to Torblocking.It is not sinister. I agree that of the various possibilities one of them is that he just doesnt care or is frosty towards people who do care. It is more likely given his pattern of antiprivacy that he is actively antiprivacy. Tor users really are secondclass netizens to him. Its not sinister. He was pretty upfront about it.gt Most of your other remarks implicitly ignore the iterative development process and assume the ossification of a temporary measure.Theres no assumption. In the face of criticism he didnt fix the problems.gt You are explaining a very public funding of a few hundred Amazon cloud servers with a sinister antiprivacy conspiracy?No Im saying that the collective group of actors with similar goals were either directly funded by people that Armstrong knew and was sympathetic to or Armstrong himself and in any event he was an active participant in the anticore reputation attacks. He used the sybil attacks as a convenient springboard for a political agenda and his lurking in Conformal IRC channels suggested an active and expected relationship. All they said when he first showed up was hey. Thats it? For the CEO of Coinbase? lolgt Coinbase could drown the network in Classic nodes and the capital required wouldnt even show in their books. You also wouldnt know it.People arent as smart as you give them credit for.gt Classic would still fail though. The numberofnodes mania is related to the stupidmasses one. People that matter already know it doesnt matter. But I guess we will continue disagreeing on this one as well since you cant tell me why you believe otherwise.If they know it doesnt matter why were they tweeting actively about it as though it mattered? I mean I agree the people who know it doesnt matter are more important individuals but assuming that Armstrong did in fact know that it was sybild nonsense that requires a level of duplicitousness which is frankly pretty damning.gt gt Toleration of attackers and criminals is not political heterogeneity.gt Lets stay loyal to the context.gt You have no means to identify attackers so not tolerating them doesnt correspond to anything on the network. All you can wish for is having plenty of parties with unaligned interests.This is not accurate. Assuming I recall what I was referring to accurately I was referring to if not criminal then at least legally actionable fraud on the part of mining ASIC vendors. Those are trivially identifiable. The context is centralizing hashrate right? Or did you think I was referring to Reddit again? Reading back I dont think I was.gt I didnt claim the motivation is privacy. But its not something an antiprivacy guy that wants to block tor nodes would propose either.In the linked links you can see that he laid out his motivations. They definitely werent privacyrelated beyond that combined with his other proposals which were specifically antiprivacy such as redlisting it is pretty reasonable to presume he was in fact antiprivacy.gt You are clearly biased when considering evidence sorry. But thanks for doing it sincerely.Your counterexamples are ironically stripped of context in the context of the body of his work the use of Tors encryption and auth mechs given his stated motivations having explicitly nothing to do with privacy the work on the whole is absent reading his mind and in its endeffect a strong antiprivacy result.Again dichotomously which is how Ive been presenting the possibilities either he was ignorant and prideful and the end effect was antiprivacy or he was deliberately antiprivacy. Either way it doesnt matter.I mean the guy did work for an RampD spinoff of the GCHQ and some listed employees share his name. Why wouldnt he be sympathetic to the authoritarian stance? In fact he stated in a number of interviews he wished Gavin would just step up and be a benign dictatorforlife like Linus Torvalds. Google wouldnt exist  in its current form without advanced antiprivacy botdetection as described by Hearn.gt Maxwell is being deceptive to further his myopic cause which is increasing the division in the community.Wait now you havent actually stated why you think gmax is being deceptive? What specifically was he being deceptive about in that one stated example you gave?gt Assuming he is in fact telling the truth he says he fought with theymos over the moderation policy in rbitcoin.gt Even his own late pronouncement of such an endeavor contains the very justifications the censors use so yes I do consider that deceptive as well.It is disingenuous to expect him to pronounce every single action he takes for extensive scrutiny by randos.gt Most if not all censorship supporters explicitly claim they are for freedom. So the only way we can tell is by peoples actions. Everyone who have continued utilizing censored communication channels have supported censorship visibly.Its moderation. Regardless of this fact so far the champions of anticensorship in rbtc have been explicitly promoting alternative projects which are in fact antifreedom. XT was unfree. classic is unfree. Conformal is unfree. BU is unfree. All of these things are attacks on the freedom of users if you agree with RMS definition of freedom in terms of code and development. If you dont theyre still attacks on transparency on privacy on financial freedom.gt Well you may be affected by the same biases which is what I am talking about when I say feuds or fixations.Or I have spoken with him at such length that when he says something ambiguous I have been privvy to explicit statements which I internally use to fill in the blanks of comprehension and understanding. You still havent actually described an explicit deception.gt On the one hand we have supposed criminals which you want to see banned. Which already seems to be the case.No hes still posting and still trolling. His contributions are nil. His comment only was removed from the subreddit. His account still exists last I checked and his posting in rbtc continues.gt On the other hand we see explicit censorship targeted at people who simply think hardforks are a better way to let the Bitcoin protocol evolve.Im not going to defend the removal of bigblock reasoned arguments absent trolling. If it is an honest effort and Peter Rizuns efforts for example are not honest then removing it is something I disagree with. Removing uncivil trolling venomous people I have no problem with.

Most of this comment has no evidence for his proprivacy stance. bitcoinjs existence was not a privacyenhancement mech. I dont know which crowdfunding platform youre talking about. Lighthouse?

But she miners would charge more than enough to cover their costs of receiving and processing the blocks the blocks and the UTXO set cannot get so big that the miners cannot handle them anymore.gt What happens to the externality of people who run full nodes?A fullyverifying node that does not mine and does not relay is good only for the person running it.  If he is not willing to pay the cost of verifying the blockchan that is his problem.  I cannot afford to check all the documents that my government puts online so what?Nonmining relays NMRs  nodes that sit between miners and simple clients relaying transactions andor blocks  are worse than useless.   They were never a part of the design.  They dont make the network more secure on the contrary they break its already weak security guarantees.  The latter are based on the now unfortunately false trust that a majority of the miners will be motivated by the block rewards and fees to mine only valid blocks and service all transactions that pay sufficient fees.  But NMRs do not have these incentives so they cannot be trusted at all.  They cannot fix invalid blocks they can only censor blocks or transactions that they dont like  which may be the good ones instead of bad ones.NMRs are particularly dangerous in the current implementation of Core.  Hardcoded in it are six seed nodes none of them mining.  Clients are supposed to contact these six to get the addresses of further nodes if they care.  IIRC of the six seed nodes four were run by Blockstream employees or contractors one by Jeff Garzik and one by Peter Todd.  It is therefore quite possible for those nodes to conspire so as to block payments by Core clients to or  from specified addresses or show to Core clients a minority blockchain while censoring the majority one. I belive that NMRs were introduced in the network unofficially and without any technical justification when mining became unprofitable and too expensive for the bitcoin pioneers who are mostly based in the US or Europe and moved increasingly to China.  I believe that the NMRs were and still are seen as a way for those pioneers to retain control over the network  which according to the design should instead be exerted by the miners through hashpower vote.gt Why would people trust this minority network that is much more fragile due to its reduced numbers and increased resource requirements to safeguard all their billions of wealth? You should rather ask why should people trust the nonmining relay nodes  who have no incentive to be honest may censor good transactions and blocks can be cloned by the thousands at little cost and can relay unverified or invalid data undetected and unpunished?  Nodes that if you use a Core clients are all ultimately chosen by the Core developers?Clients who cannot afford to verify the whole blockchain should avoid NMRs and talk directly to miners or to relay nodes that are known to be run by miners like those that BTCC recently set up.   Clients should run whatever partial validations they can afford of course and drop any miners who are found to be misbehaving but they will have to trust the miners and that is the best they can do.This was the original design and it would have worked except for a few other unrelated problems if mining was dispersed among  miners maybe less as Satoshi assumed.  But unfortunately that did not happen.  Much against Satoshis expectations  today  mining companies  Chinese  Ukranian  have nearly  of the hashing power.So you should ask instead why should clients trust those  companies to safeguard all their billions of wealth?  Well I think they shouldnt.  ,btc,d4ffj5j,1,t5_2si5v

Only one connection to a node that has the longest chain is enough to override all other nodes hiding that from you.gt If the auction was held in bitcoin one entrant X could perhaps trick a competitor Y into connecting to NMR nodes that are actually all controlled by X and silently block his deposit until past the deadline.Since the attack and the defense are both well known this would simply be operator error. You could also say that they could accept a zero fee transaction that never confirmed and that would mess things up too. Also if these are well known people attempting fraud and providing evidence to that fact they theoretically risk the threat of justice although I am given to understand that does not much apply to oil company management in Brazilgt Or X could rent out AntPools mining power for one dayThis could be well known too. The defense here is to wait for a period of time long enough to feel secure in the penalty costs of the attacker. Bitcoin indeed does not provide theoretically perfect security any more than I would feel safe walking in some neighborhoods of Rio hoping that the government would impose a stiff cost on anyone who would violate my person or property.This is an imperfect system that still requires active participation and acknowledgement of risks. The goal is simply to force the action of having to pay AntPool or construct complex partitioning schemes to make attacking expensive and cooperating beneficial not to preclude any possibility of attack.gt If your  contacts are all miners including the top  then gt of the mining power must be conspiring against you in which case bitcoin is dead.Bitcoin is not dead if there is an  attack there is a higher level construct beyond the hash power which is the user base. The record of payments still exists in a redundant way so that record can be used to recreate the idea of Bitcoin in a new system thats what a hard fork is. Theres no easy way to kill an idea it takes a lot even if the idea is badgt The NMR nodes have nothing to lose in lying to you. If people find out that a node is lying all they can do is stop using it and the owner can simply sets up another one.Its true they have nothing to lose but normal nodes have nothing to gain either. The network configuration of the peer to peer network is not the definitive configuration. If necessary you can use other methods like Tor and VPNs to create more complex constructs to make partitioning you even more expensive. You can also wait for a long time and algorithmically notice that a chain looks out of the statistical expectation and pause for manual input.gt Did I mention that with mining concentrated as it is now bitcoin is dead  just a walking zombie?Why would we fear zombies if they would not keep walking. Really what is important is how and why Bitcoin will die if you leave those important details out you are being pretty vague. I could say that you are a walking zombie too since I am pretty positive you will die at some point thats just the nature of entropy.gt You can always use VPNs or nonbitcoin proxies to contact the miners so that they dont knw who you are.While you describe attacks in theory they are both.

Your wallet will package the transaction into a compatible format and relay it through the network. This then is combined into a block which verifies transaction making sure they are compatible with the balances in the blockchain. Once the Blockchain verifies transactions you can check the number of confirmations. Its possible to construct erroneous transactions say send yourself k Bitcoin or double spend from a node but it will get rejected so nodes do not hold the power to create the block. A standard QT wallet will not allow this by default as you have full blockchain to check against. Nodes do relay blocks.,btc,d4p89vh,2,t5_2si5v

Ex  evenly distributed nodes is more decentralized than  closely clustered nodes.Decentralization needs a functional definition we all believe bitcoin should be decentralized but some of us dont buy your framing for eg.  nodes running in competition to each other is far more decentralized than  modes running one implementation from a centralized authority.

8351631,0,t1_d5l6mu1,Miners can collude and create a cartel and do nasty things  e.g. not allowing any transactions with fee under  BTC orphaning any blocks from minerminority that violates this. They can also secretly use the blockchain to encode their transactions or whatever including the parallel version of blockchain you suggest  but for this to have any real usage they must get users on board  users that will use their new system with their new rules e.g. those confiscated funds etc.. But once they try to get users they would need to show the source code of the client  and the whole community will see immediately how antiBitcoin their plan is. Swift nuking from the developers ensues change of POW algo that will be a giant fuck you to the evil miners as they will lost they hundred million dollar investments  if users are with developers and not with miners miners are done...gt I can think of several scenarios where miners would be tempted to change the rules. Would they dare to? I dont know but nothing that depends on humans is  certain. In a way its amazing that Bitcoin still works. OTOH maybe its logical we just cant wrap our heads around it in that short  year lifespan of it. One fundamental part is the opensource aspect. If this brandflavor fails there are many new offsprings that can thrive. I think thanks to incorporating bittorrent technology cryptocurrencies are very robust and viable invention. Also what I find interesting is that usersdevelopers can keep miners in check usersminers can keep developers in check ...and developersminers also influence users considerably  this resembles the division of power in states into three gov branches legislative  executive  judical.gt My view of Ethreum was little better than my view of Bitcoin but I would never have thought that they would so easily junk the principle that is the very foundation of the project to cancel a blotched contract.Regarding ETH  I was both amazed and disgusted by the HF. OTOH  if they learn from it amp never do it again we can dismiss this as baby steps... Probably many unfortunate things fired together  new unexperienced users or bitcoin veterans but too enthusiastic about such new tech risks not explored yet tools and good practices not developed yet the noble cause of the DAO help projects and anything ethereum together  maybe it will never align like that again. But I will stay skeptical for a year of two regarding ETH... Also these major problems notwithstanding it still looks like a classic bubble amp I expect it going below .

I am quite positive  I think we can reunite more or less and come out stronger out of all this. Which also includes being able to stick to the fundamentals and protect all the feats that make Bitcoin what it is. You might not feel like that but for me Bitcoin is marvelmiracle both technology and socially. It will change the world.

I agree that it is possible for a transaction to go unconfirmed if it is not replaced. And I agree that if such transactions were piling up then I should be able to see this as a net increase in the mempool on the nodes that I am operating. But I do not see such evidence. I see my mempool going up and dropping back down as transactions are cleared. The trend for this is essentially flat. I do not run nodes continually sometimes I shut them down for maintenance. In that case it is up to the other nodes in the network to continue processing the transactions in their mempools. There may be rare occurrences where a transaction is dropped from all nodes before it can be processed but with some  nodes I think that unlikely.

The only known way to prevent it from happening is for mining to be very centralized or centrally controlled directly or via invasive regulations which would have far worse effects for Bitcoins value.  There are arguments that delaying that eventuality is harmful encouraging insecure practices and arguments that delaying it is helpful enabling simpler transaction processing before better tools exist.

Perhaps he makes the deposits and withdrawls of the sidecurrencies always fail so that nobody gets started. Perhaps he requires newbies to trade in batches too huge for any person to ever attempt while his shilltrades humm along unencumbered. Perhaps he sets the fees so high or hides layers of security hoops nobody can ever finish jumping through. Whatever it is no listed trades are legitimately involving a party aside from Harry behind the scenes.Harry sets whatever price he chooses on whatever unit volume he chooses and announces capcoin Market Cap  ltMade up  of USDgt!News outlets who arent paying attention that being the primary party I am arguing against here run through a blogroll somewhere showing the market caps of all of the altcoins and include this Capcoin nonsense number along with many other nonsense numbers ahem into their calculations.That is what I am trying to argue. CapCoin is a ridiculously airtight example but other variants exist. You run the exchange but only allow nonshill buys at the prices you set and never allow nonshill sells.

Battery capacity is the primary constraint  right now the five batteries can only power one S through the night but we can scale that quickly.As for cost I only have rough figures but I was surprised at how cheap it was. My partner sources the panels for less than  per and he has  or  installed currently  the big inverter for the antminer is roughly  and the small inverter for the router and labtops is roughly  the batteries are a little over  per and he has five installed at the moment. Im guessing here but you might add another  or so for all of the cables and capacity monitors... and thats pretty much it. He installed everything himself so labor cost was zero. I will confirm this but my impression is that this system cost roughly  grand give or take.As for government subsidy I dont know for sure but I doubt it  though I would never fault anyone for claiming any deduction they could.

Originally it was devised as an extension of bitcoin where youd be able to convert from bitcoin to these invisible coins on the same blockchain so youd practically have  coins on the same blockchain.

9157191,0,t1_d8cmtjt,My very limited understanding of BU is that users can decide their acceptance depth and a block limit. This may not be the right terminology but by acceptance depth I mean the number of confirmations before the node will just go with the longer chain despite it having blocks larger than their maximum and by max block size I mean the limit on blocks they will accept and broadcast without referencing the acceptance depth.The idea that BU will have a free market for blocksize where users and miners will proactively set these values is neat and all but the likely outcome is that   rule is a rule for a reason will not change the defaults. Lets say that we have an extremely interested set of miners and users and only  leave it with the defaults the other  will be spread out between . MB LukeJr and friends and huge block size limits or unlimited limits.If  are at a default setting and the other  are spread out across a curve of max block size settings its very likely that the actual limit will converge on  as the  will be all over the place and with different acceptance depths the default value will have a built in advantage over other settings for max block size.You can run a monte carlo simulation for this but its mostly guessing without real life data. A good proxy is the max block size used by miners. Many kept a kb limit in place for a LONG time after we were running way over that as the median. The default is likely to be the  rule not the . That means its even more likely that whatever ships with BU as the default is going to end up being the defacto default after the acceptance depth math plays out in the market.That said make the default maxblocksize that ships with BU  and make it scale up  every years worth of block height or  every  years or whatever tiny percent every  blocks as long as its scaling at around  a year. This matches long term trends in hardwarebroadbandstorage efficiency increases. It ensures that if Im right I am and the default ends up being the limit we never ever have to revisit this subject again in the future.If the default max block size with BU is unlimited I see that as potentially dangerous. Not for economic reasons but technical ones and also because I do not think its safe to have an unlimited blockchain size. There is a very real risk of centralization and regulation of centralized full nodes. That risk isnt at MB though. Its much higher even today. I think BIP does a great job of staying beneath the long term trend of risk in hardware resource requirements to keep Bitcoin nodes decentralized.I could go on but just set the default max block size that ships with BU to scale with BIP at different block heights and drop the hand wavy market decides the limit BS and I will fully support BU. Otherwise it seems too risky and theoretical and not only assumes efficient markets but requires them. The three potential dangers of BU without a well planned default max block size One miner publishes one very very large block and if the thing is allowed to propagate it could be devastating.   The long term cumulative effect of too large blocks building up so that nodes grow out of reach for normal people and only can be run by well financed institutions is also dangerous. The default value is fixed and we end up having a political battle on our hands to get people to raise the limit and enter some value into a GUI or command line could also be devastating. Trust me people are lazy.Just put BIP into BUs default and we are good.,btc,d8cqo76,2,t5_2si5v

Not sure if you are still looking at these or not..The reason I compared again the settlement layer case where transaction fees rise to  per transaction is that this vision proposed by the small block proponents at first sounds like it could lead to higher total transaction fees for the miners. Constrained block space would create an artificial market to drive up fees.I wanted to show that even if this plan works which is highly unlikely it would still lead to less revenue overall than a high volume of onchain transactions with low fee per transaction. An unconstrained block limit allows Bitcoin to grow to wide adoption where even if individual transaction fees are low the much higher volume leads to far more total revenue for miners than could be reached as a settlement layer.,btc,d8wdej8,1,t5_2si5v

Then the mods like ubashco tried to say everyone with an opinion that was different was a sockpuppet none of us are real didnt you know? and banned most the early adopters and long time users.then they began censoring all mention of censorshp as well continue to delete comments they didnt agree with and ban users who tried to point out lies or correct false statementsThe end result is a highly skewed spin on reality but as new people go to bitcoin they are fed an endless stream of propagada reinforced by a set of sockpuppets and other people who simple have never heard the truth.Really though if you need censorship because your ideas cant stand on their own versus other ideas then you are on the wrong side,btc,d8xjnxp,48,t5_2si5v

Allowing miners to permanently cap the blocksize supply of transaction volumes is no different than letting the OPEC cartel deciding together how much petrol to extract to artificially raise the price instead of letting them compete to reach a fair free market equilibrium price.

9420043,0,t1_d99yx66,SegWit addresses look like regular Bitcoin addresses until they have had one transaction broadcast that spends or attempts to spend their funds.

Funds in these addresses can be spent in a blockchain consisting of majority SegWit nodes only by people holding the appropriate private keys.  However funds in these addresses can be spent by anybody in a blockchain consisting of preSegWit nodes.  It is possible to have scenarios where there is actually only one chain but at various times the chain was preSegwit later postSegwit activated Segwit and finally reverted back to nonSegwit.Because of the number of possible combinations of nodes blockchains scenarios etc...  there are many possible conditions and the mind boggles.

Large dynamically changing databases that result in calculations that change the databases that have to be communicated involve feedback loops and Murphys Law says that these will usually work to result in failure sometimes catastrophic failure.The basic premise of monitoring a channel  to recover before timers goes off turns an asynchronous system Bitcoin into a real time system LN layered on top of Bitcoin.  It is not possible to produce a reliable synchronous system on top of an unreliable synchronous system and that includes Bitcoin but sometimes it is possible to calculate the relevant probabilities.  This is possible with Bitcoin because of the randomization provided by the POW hash function which provides a physical model for the independence of random events.  In the case of LN it is not possible to calculate the relevant probabilities because of the positive feedback loops that ensure if a centrally located hub fails  leading to the recursive and highly correlated closure of multiple channels producing a spike of correlated load on the underlying network.LN will work to the extent it is providing only a small leverage to the underlying network but as soon as it starts providing benefits the feedback loops and correlations will ensure that the system will become unstable.

9615517,0,t1_d9y7v32,The manager nodes of pools A and B must assemble the respective templates of block N candidates AN and BN and send them to all their miners.  Therefore that task implies the same wasted work for both pools.  However if block N was solved first by a miner in pool A then the manager of pool A will know the hash h of that block AN before the manager of pool B gets it.  Since both pools need to know h in order to build the template of block N  the manager of pool A will start doing that task before the manager of pool B can start doing it.Pool B can get h at the earliest when the manager of pool A distributes the template of AN to its miners.  That is possible if pool A has open membership and the manager of pool B poses as a member of pool A.  Otherwise the manager of pool B will only get h through the normal block broadcast mechanism which now seems to be pretty fast but cannot be faster than pool As internal template distribution mechanism. gt increase their chance of being orphanedIf pool A has enough hashpower the advantage of delaying the broadcast of AN and start to mine AN before the other pools may offset the risk of losing AN to another miner.,btc,d9yb6ht,1,t5_2si5v

Your post history indicates that it is extremely unlikely you would be in favor of bigger blocks if compact fraud proofs existed.

9874184,0,t1_daulwo4,gt But it doesnt have to be so expensive small blocks mean less expenses to spam the blockchain with transactions driving fees to in my opinion silly heights. More blockspace means more costs to spam a full block with transactions MB doubles the transaction count from what we now have MB would quadruple it if not more.Reality has proven otherwise. Every time the block size increased spam expanded to fill it. Spammers are also not the ones paying the fees  they found ways to get others to pay it for them a long time ago.gt But Lightning isnt Bitcoin right?It is actually. Lightning is just smartoptimised use of Bitcoins builtin smart contract system.gt What will be the requirements of a Lightning node for me the average user? Im running an Unlimited node just fine what incentive do I have to run a Lightning node as well? That just seems like doing double the amount of work.Requirements should be lower than running a full node. The primary incentive is typically instant confirmation.gt Thats true if we could run an SPV off of a Bitcoin Unlimited or Core or any node that would be best because you wouldnt have to trust another node. Maybe thats a good thing to look into?People have looked into it. Thats how we realised it wasnt actually possible. Fraud proofs are used to detect invalid blocks. But the problem is those invalid blocks have no reason to be wellformed and can therefore be carefully constructed such as to make a fraud proof impossible. For example by having a corrupt merkle tree that affects only a single transaction nobody cares about.gt But isnt it the whole point of transactions to be recorded in the Blockchain? Because to me it seems that this whole Lightning thing just makes users transact tokens to one another without directly touching the blockchain the whole point of Bitcoin is irreversible instant transactions for none to low fees.The blockchain does not provide irreversible instant transactions at all. Lightning does that. The blockchain is also inherently expensive. The catch with Lightning is that it only works with the blockchain backing it up. Its only with both the blockchain and Lightning that Bitcoin can accomplish the goals you and many others have for it.gt How is it broken? According to this post the consensus system works just fine. How does BU in your view break the consensus? By giving users a choice?Unless all users choose the same thing blocks can be constructed which some users accept and others do not. This splits the system into two parallel and competing blockchains effectively creating an altcoin for each user under scenarios where even a single miner is hostile. With such an environment a single block confirmation provides no security whatsoever and even with more blocks the relative security is reduced. BU does typically have a point where it will accept any block size up to some hard limit regardless of user preference so I suppose there might be a certain confirmation eventually after a day or two? but even that breaks down if miners continue to build their parallel blockchains which is the default behaviour.gt Bitcoin Unlimited wont need a fork of any kind it will accept the new blocksize without questionThat is by definition a hardfork! Removing a rule such as the  MB block size limit  hardfork.gt leave it at EBAD by default.Even this is a hardfork because it relaxes the  MB block size limit rule such that it ceases to apply if buried under enough work.gt If someone explicitly doesnt like it they can let their accepted size stay what it is and they would still follow consensus if bigger blocks would be created.Its not consensus if anyone doesnt like it. Nodes dont follow consensus they decide consensus.gt Segwit isnt a blocksize increase it removes safety features as I have understood it from the transaction hash in order to reduce the size a transaction uses on the blockchain.Youve been lied to. The transaction size isnt reduced at all nor are any features removed.gt That aside softforks seem to be more opposed to hardforks if Ive read the subreddits correctlyOnly on this mostlytroll subreddit. Most of rBitcoin which is much larger is the complete opposite and even the entirety of reddit is only a small portion of the entire Bitcoin community.gt Yes but if the people are unaware of a choice its not really a choice is it?

10073436,0,t1_dbjj1v5,This is a very serious misunderstanding. The point of running a full node is to ensure that you can validate transactions and blocks. If validation is not important to you there is no point in running a full node. In a hard fork miners and node operators must have consensus in order for the change to take place. Without consensus from nodes miners cannot impose changes on the network through a hard fork. This represents an important check and balance on miner authority and ensures that there is network consensus for changes before they are implemented.In a soft fork the miners do not have to wait for consensus from nodes miners agree amongst themselves to make a change and force it on the network. You the node are unaware the rules have been changed out from underneath you! Your node goes on telling you that youre validating blocks but in reality your node doesnt even understand the blocks its receiving.So the proper way to understand a soft fork is as an attack on consensus. In a soft fork miners basically impose a change and dare users to live with the change counterattack by building a client to hardfork away from the change or exit the ecosystem.I oppose this approach on principle.   ,btc,dbkla5z,2,t5_2si5v

You may call this peachy but when we start throwing valid users off the chain and saying theres no room for you! I call that a disaster.  What you call a coalition of miners hardforking the coin I would call a coalition of miners choosing simple onchain scaling.  Miners arent going to split the network in two if they can avoid it.  If they adopt Bitcoin Unlimited it will be mostly as a group.  They dont plan to damage themselves or anyone else financially.  They plan to enable the network to scale which will be good for everyone.  ,btc,dcgy2go,6,t5_2si5v

10412611,1,t1_dcoaq99,Just today I have been called a shill a retard a troll destroying bitcoin turning it into an altcoin in the space of an hour for expressing my opinion in the same way I just did with you. You gave a decent response which is great but this is not what happens for me regularly. If you go to rbitcoin talking about how great BU the trolls will come after you just as you said. If you break the forums rules then you will get posts removed and banned. Maybe even before the bigger trolls get to have go. Im not saying they have good rules... but it is their forum and they can do with it as they please. If they ban  of the people who use bitcoin then that is their choice those people will find a better place to communicate and then there will be no subscribers left. If you come here trying to have a discussion like this sub was designed for you get insulted and have conspiracy theories for every point with never any proof. There are times where theres decent discussions but these threads can become hidden by the constant hate posts aimed at rbitcoin or core or blockstream or anything really associated with SegWit. When people move past this and let rbitcoin do what ever they place this place would be a much better sub.This line of argument begins to deteriorate to the level of two kids on the playground at school arguing about whose dad is tougher.To label each sub as a side is reducing the debate down to something far too simple. There is life outside of reddit. Even if it was centred around reddit... rbitcoin has x the subscribers so x the trolls shouldnt be too surprising. If their censorship proves wrong then everyone will leave the subreddit and come here or somewhere else. Come on the solution is always objectivity. If you didnt state which side was worse it would have been the perfect post. It would have accurately portrayed what is going on and there would be no beginning of the argument of which side is worse. Without a doubt statements have been made against BU which were stupid and thoughtless. They are scaling proposals. Ones that if all involved in bitcoin worked together to perhaps improve what they thought were wrong rather than to dismiss they might even be in a much better place than right now in regards to adoption. However the same has been said going the other way. BU developers have literally said they found problems in Cores code which they didnt report and tried to weaponise... SegWit also gets completely disregarded as an ugly hack and vaporware and not a scaling solution which it isnt designed to be. Deciding which side hurts the others feelings most does nothing to move things forward. At the end of the day it is a matter of pride and ego. Being able to put it behind for the greater good. ,btc,dcoc5cb,1,t5_2si5v

The lack of nodes enforcing this rule wouldnt matter to me because this change would further empower the role of a few miners me being one of the select few I would be a little concerned about how bitcoin is perceived though so would have to create a campaign of selling some individual ASICs to local chinese users to give the perception that the average person was mining and my pool was mostly filled with users who could point their hashpower elsewhere if I misbehaved .

10416563,0,t1_dcoic02,gt I just realized but your scenario could happen regardless of the block size couldnt it?Yes it could.  But I think uhgmichnas comment was suggesting that a monopoly of the miners is more likely with BU.  In your comment you assume a scenario where the negative consequences of centralization would be mitigated and thus centralization would be nondetrimental to the network.  With my previous comment I intended to point out an alternative scenario where the network has become centralized for whatever reason and there could be negative sideeffects that are not kept in check.I agree the scenario I described could occur with or without SegWit but increased centralization makes the scenario more likely to occur.  Of course we dont know what would happen because it depends on who controls the majority of the hashpower and their intentions.But I believe centralization of the networks hashpower is only part of the centralizationdecentralization issue.  The nodes that relay transactions for the network can also become more centralized if nodes were to drop out from the network due to increased storage RAM and bandwidth costs.Some more conjecture  If the network is currently supported by  nodes and the number drops to  with something like  or maybe  MB blocks how difficult would it be for a nation state to switch off  nodes through the ISPs and then DDoS the remaining ?I dont know and I believe this situation is extremely unlikely.  But with a  billion market cap its worth weighing the value of decentralization against the benefits gained from larger blocks.  At  MB blocks we could support  txnsec  txnsec at  MB.  Maybe the network could even survive with  MB blocks and support  txnsec.  Unfortunately  txnsec is still far too low a throughput to support the worlds economy.  A combination of a block size increase and nd layer solutions is going to be necessary to truly scale bitcoin.  Neither SegWit or BU alone are complete solutions to the scaling problem.,btc,dcosae5,4,t5_2si5v

But the two parts go together.gtIf you mean block as they existed for the past  years before SegWit activation then noThe block data structure is fairly easy to define. Do you want to try to explain what parts are different when  segwit nodes send a block to each other? As I mentioned before when segwit sends to optout node the block will have witness removed so we are in agreement that this is different but when segwit sends to segwit node what is different? There are some differences like some data in the coinbase transaction and some transaction format changes. Overall though the block contains essentially a header and list of transactions and each transaction has inputs and outputs. Where the inputs can be used to verify that the correct private keys were used to sign the transaction.The calculation of how much data and where that data lies as already discussed has indeed changed with the introduction of the block weight rule.My comments were never meant to discuss Softfork vs Hardfork ideology risks benefits etc. You are welcome to make those arguments but I wont address them in this thread.

What happens in the future if there is a major unforeseen network problem that needs to be repaired but core refuses to repair it because it would create a hard fork?  Are we all expected to wait around while core holds the network hostage till the get their SW and to repair the problem?  at this point I can not put anything past them...The network is in a precarious place at the moment unfounded fears of network split delaying any progress one more year minimum or the network switches to BUbiiger blocks and core implements the required code to be compatible with the network.

Provides password recovery capability but designed such that Airbitz still has no access to the private keys.. Encrypts the private keys before saving them on the device. Protects against malware that simply swipes your device storage.. Allows users to tag their transactions with metadata. ie. payee category fiat value and notes which are all clientside encrypted and backed up for full privacy. Send payment requests via emailsms which are autotagged when payment is received. ie. Send bobdomain.com a public address via email. When he pays that address the transaction shows in the wallet as coming from bobdomain.com. Export transactions to CSV or QBO Quickbooks format. Full functionality across iOS and Android and ability to sync account across devices with just usernamepassword. Optional fingerprint login on iOS and Android instead of PIN.

10594484,0,t1_dd85pvf,gt Would that be acceptable?Thats up to the individual to decide. The truly devoted might decide that it was. The transaction bleedover can be alleviated by mixing coins to make new transactions which are not valid on the alternate chain. This would also help with the mempool issues a bit. The minor chain would also likely not see many transactions after a while.The main problem with the minor chain forking in this scenario is that the reason they would be the minor chain is that they were staunchly against hardforking. Which puts them in a tricky situation. Im not saying its a wise thing to continue to support the minor chain just that many would.Note this is different than a deliberate minor fork such as the folk at rbtcfork are intending which will include protections against such things.,btc,dd8qmax,1,t5_2si5v

10633402,1,t3_5s6b61,You have fallen pray to bad propaganda. The Core team is at least as interested in bitcoins success as anybody else.They recognize that Bitcoin can never scale to micropayments because a blockchain run by thousands of miners on expensive equipment is obviously not suitable for millions of small payments.Hence they have paved the road by first solving some earlier problems combined with a moderate block capacity increase through SegWit which is already in the code tested and ready to be activated through a soft fork with  support. The next step will be highperformance payment systems suitable for small and very small payments. One of these the Lightning Network is already being tested and looks very good to me.ELIS All is well the road is clear. I do not see any even remotely viable alternative.Now we could discuss why not everybody sees it like that but that is more difficult to analyse. One reason is that there seems to be a very simple solution that can also be explained to stupid peoplejust make the blocks larger. Unfortunately it is not as simple as it first sounds but why that is so is a bit more complicated so no ELIS is available. It should be sufficiently obvious to a clear thinker though that a the blockchain cannot be scaled to lowvalue transactions and b a hard fork is very dangerous and requires a nearly complete consensus and a long preparation time to be successful.,btc,ddcr6ed,-1,t5_2si5v

10688858,0,t3_5svida,Heres the reality of the matter There have been two different general ideas on how to scale Bitcoin since it was first launched. The safer method scale conservatively and gradually in piece meal as far as the main chain is concerned and work on secondary layers for transactional usecases. This will be needed long term no matter what if Bitcoin is used truly globally to protect the decentralization and censorship resistance of the main chain. The second path forward is simply increase the the main blockchains throughput capacity withso far no serious thought given to improving the efficiency of its throughput and hope just throwing hardware at it will solve the problem. This is a very poor idea right now considering the current rates of improvement with technology and gives no thought to protecting the decentralization and censorship resistance of the network beyond If more people can transact cheap lots of people will run nodes! The feud is essentially an artifact of a group of developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andreesen who instead of continuing to discuss the trade offs involved here and arrive at the most efficient solution started actively politickingwhich included organized spamming of rBitcoin with posts solely advocating for action and no discussions as well as organized vote manipulation and personal attacks for same goals for the second avenue of action without any type of widespread consensus or community support being arrived at first.

10798912,0,t1_ddtsu7v,Yes there have been discussions in the past. But it was not brought up in the context of reasons for SegWit until the storage issue and the bandwidth issue and a couple of other things probably had been debunked and put away.The page you linked to gives reasons for the choice which are not related to UTXO growth in any real manner other than handwaving. Which is it? The page does however indicate how Core SegWit would if implemented be used as a block to an actual block size increase. We can handle MB but were going to blow it on a scheme that maybe will rise to .MB eventually. If anything it arguably would have been better to go for a  discount which would have lead to a max MB for a realistic .MB and to allow for a potential doubling of the block size limit and would have made it less cheap to spam the network. However the analysis which lead to the .MB real world usage was not done until after the discount had been announced. And then it was done by someone not a Core developer. Its also worth pointing out that the page is from January of this year and the source for the graph links to a conversation from January of this year. The discount was proposed what over a year ago?The discount is not a direct reward to UTXO shrinkage. It rewards SegWit data which may or may not relate to UTXO. Thus it is indirect.gtIt wouldnt necessarily reduce the UTXO set directly it would just make it much cheaper to make transactions that dont increase it further or consolidate many inputs into one output. Incentives fee frugality should handle the rest.It might proportionally reduce the number of UTXOs per user but that is not a scaling solution. If the number of UTXOs scales per user some factor will not make a particular difference. If it scales per the square of the number of users its even more ineffective. Its a posthoc rationalization from the world of Greg Maxwell.If you think Im trolling I cant help you. These are all observations that have developed over time.

10800516,0,t1_ddtw9gt,gtI may have to utilize my interpretive skills more than normal.I also saved a comment from a few months back where the block weight calculation was effectively reverseengineered by uAmichateur even before he had considered the UTXO cost factor. I remember intending to give him gold for the comment but I seem to have forgotten to do so. I might get to that in a moment.In any case heres the comment if youre interestedgtAn actual block size increase would allow for more traditional transactions. Thus not a block size increase.Traditional transactions have undesirable scaling properties. I dont think calling blocksize increases that work to mitigate the effects of these by introducing nextlevel transaction types should be necessarily disqualified as actual blocksize increases. Blocks will be able to fit more transactions they will use up more bytes both bandwidth and storage unless you prune they will be larger in size any way you slice it. Even legacy transactors will indirectly benefit from the increased capacity because there will be more room in the base block for them as data is segregated to the witness section.gta lot of what you claim as proving me wrong is merely gainsaying me and a lot of your mathematical facts are merely assertions.Fair enough. I know that this is a fault of mine I can be abrasively and arrogantly confrontational. I constantly slip up and let it get the best of me despite my most sincere efforts. I truly am sorry if Ive been a dick to you I meet a lot of hostility in this subreddit and am often a bit gainsayy here as a result.gthaving looked at a lot of graphs in my time something smells funny about that one. Ill have to look into it though and Ill get back to you.I appreciate it. And I do see where youre coming from. Your comment here made me revisit my own perspective on this subject because I can totally see the skepticism when you look over that pagechart. The problem I believe is how abstract the axeslines are... which is an unfortunate necessity if youre trying to depict the logic of the block weight calculation i.e. witness discount into a graph format. Basically the birdseye breakdown is that assuming we want to grant a capacity increase and upwards blocksize adjustment at all the block weight calculation has to include a witness discount factor. If we want to keep worstcase adversarial blocksizes restricted to a maximum of MB which On Scaling Bitcoin and other related discussion had gauged as a safe maximum weight value then that further restricts what the factor can be. Beyond that the chosen value seems to be optimized around a inout average transaction profile which I will grant seems a bit questionable of a benchmark.Now that I am thinking more on this the block weight calculation does seem to be the most perhaps only reasonable qualm that one might have with SegWit. I think the chosen equation was basically a decent attempt at meeting the objectives of UTXOincentivealignment simplicity and a meaningful blocksize increase. But perhaps a different discount factor would be more appropriate.For one I would think it would make a lot of sense to optimize around inout transactions rather than the other way around... which would incentivize UTXO minimization a little bit more. However if Im not mistaken this would result in a smaller effective blocksize increase. Ugly tradeoff.,btc,ddtzvpm,2,t5_2si5v

Bitcoin is working fine. Only the fees will rise so verylowvalue payments will not be made. But bitcoin was never wellsuited to these anyway.The rising price of bitcoin indicates to me that those lowvalue payments are not important for bitcoin.In any case I cannot change things. I can only try to predict what will happen. I predict that SegWit will be activated later this year and that next year we will happily use the Lightning Network or some other similar system for small casual everyday payments.If some users drive to other cryptocoins right now they will either come back after things are straightened out or I will drift myself.,btc,ddy0tm3,1,t5_2si5v

10843653,0,t1_ddyesdj,One could argue that a consequence of failing to compromise even an inch is going to be an alternate team.  Without wishing to get into the blame game extensively you can only dam up user requirements for so long before the flow seeks another outlet or the dam crumbles.Secondly I happen to think that an emergent consensus concept for block size is quite a visionary idea  being as it is capable of adjusting over time without repeated need for dev intervention  in this regard the system is more self contained and in my mind more in keeping with the spirit of bitcoin itself  which was meant to be able to adjust to increasing hash power without some dev pulling some lever.  I do not see how we would ever go from cores code base via an incremental approach to get to this kind of solution.  While I think the concept of emergent consensus for block size is a good vision I would hope to see more people seriously considering it and working on it rather than just flat out rejecting it.I hope Erik and others push for this compromise  and then you will see for yourselves exactly what kind of opposition you are working against  I predict he and you will get nowhere meanwhile time ticks away evermore.  The time for compromise was a year ago or more  and it wasnt forthcoming then.  Ultimately the miners will decide.  Working on BU and putting it out there does not in any way force the miners to accept it.  You also know that a few individuals in core have massive influence on the dev community.  The number of devs supporting core only may appear to be very large  but as I said before the dam can only hold for so long.  One more thing to please consider  deeply not dismissivelyGiven that core has so many devs on side given that of those there are some of the most experienced and who claim to be most qualified given that they are the incumbent implementation given that numerous of these individuals have funded positions and the ability to travelpresent consult etc given that there are obviously people employed to support the core position  eg blockstream employees  why is it that there is such a division in the community including the mining community.  Why is there so much support for BU if as you assert it is so risky?  With all their advantages and expertise you would expect that  they would have no trouble getting their enhancements adopted...These things dont happen for no reason...Even if you get a compromise deal this time  what about the next time something needs to change...now that is another kind of risk isnt it?,btc,ddyg33x,14,t5_2si5v

10850101,0,t3_5v2yk1,Glad you asked what settings miners are going to run rather than  like most people  assuming BU implements or proposes anything. Miners may or may not use EBAD and may or may not set the blocksize cap higher. And users and investors may or may not accept their changes.Now that its hopefully clear this discussion has nothing to do with BU other than as a way of undoing Cores weird attempt to rig the consensus process by doing is best to bundle its preferred settings inextricably with its code offerings we can muse about what the miners and investors will do. I suspect a small increase at first as a test like to MB then if that goes well move it up to MB or so with maybe some miners using ADEB settings. But I think once Cores attempt to hold the community over a barrel is broken miners will realize either the blocksize settings will only ever change in big planned flag days so no need for ADEB or they will see that they can do whatever they want and design their own tools for autopiloting whenever blocksize shifts happen unexpectedly if ever.

This does not mean that either organization is the source of the limit the source of the limit is its utility nothing more.Your inabity to acknowledge or recognize this utility does not mean that somehow Blockstream or Bitcoin Core have magically become the source of the limit in any way. In fact plenty of people who have never contributed a line of code to Core in their lives are also capable of recognizing the limits utility and have done so publicly.

10909893,0,t3_5vu27g,I think hes right. The confusion is over what the promise is and who is promising it. Bitcoin is valuable as a money because it is useful and scarce. It has value.Intrinsic value as used by most gold bugs means other value cases like the use of gold in manufacturing. They think this embedded value which can be completely unrelated to any monetary use  underwrites the monetary value of their asset.Embedded value is a double edge sword. It can support value during hard times but it can hijack a currency if the secondary use becomes more valuable than the money.Does bitcoin have embedded value as well as being intrinsically valuable? Probably yes. It has other use cases apart from money. Its use as a settlement layer is in conflict with its use as a PP currency at the moment.The fiat USD is backed by the faith of the US government. The extent of the backing is that the government will keep faith with users by continuing to accept dollars as legal tender NOT that it will support the value.Bitcoin makes its own promise and keeps faith with its users based on its own independent parameters.

10983158,0,t1_decv7zq,gtDude I got it from the website that you linked me to.You misunderstood my comment above. SegWit increases the blocksize to a MB weight limit. If it were to activate and we saw that blocks over MB in size did not have a serious detrimental effect we could always hard fork scale back the witness discount and increase the base block size while smoothly reducing the extensionwitness block. In a simple example do a MB base block and a MB witness section. It would unfortunately mean a slight skew in favor of continued UTXO bloat and would naturally have to come bundled with some safety measures as any hard fork would but it would be possible and a reasonable proposition that numerous Core developers have already indicated that they would find logical.gtGive me the value for the decentralization of the Bitcoin network right now..Some of us would prefer for it to be higher than  if at all possible.gtAfter the last  months Trust us carries no water anymore.Where did I ever say trust us or anything even remotely resembling that? I was simply explaining why demanding a hardfork blocksize increase commitment from members of Core doesnt make sense if you understand the Capacity Roadmap and the scaling strategy it represents. Core have delivered everything listed in the Capacity Roadmap since it was written and now were just waiting for SegWit to activate to see if we can safely increase the blocksize with a hard fork afterwards. Thats the last step after all. But it is contingent on the results and data we receive from SegWits capacity increase.You might think this is a suboptimal plan but by no means is it reducible down to trust us... maybe you would have been able to legitimately argue that a year ago before Core developers actually delivered all the progress that was planned on the Roadmap but now theyve already hit all the checkpoints and at this point were waiting on the ecosystem before any other capacity solutions are prioritized.Obviously a giant portion of the network about half doesnt see capacity as that pressing of a concern if theyre not signalling support for any capacityincreasing solutions.

Just for starters you can take two PoW blockchains and calculate the expected total work in hash operations and then do a simple mathematical comparison of total energy consumption required to produce each one to decide on which chain is the true chain. The assumption required for correctness here is easily calculated in energy expended. The analysis is trivial and is essentially complete in the Bitcoin white paper if a majority of the hash power is honest i.e. working to append the chain at the tip rather than rewrite it from scratch then the probability of successfully rewriting the chain is asymptotically zero.You will not find such a rigorous yet simple mathematical proof for the correctness of a Proof of Stake system.

10999596,0,t1_deeokrr,There are natural constraints upon the block size  these are imposed by the limits at a point in time of the infrastructure that supports the bitcoin network.  These constraints would create an authentic fee market  one in which all coins would compete equally upon.  By refusing to allow the block size to grow at this early stage in bitcoins life an artificial scarcity of blockspace is created  one which is well below the potential blockspace capacity  and this in turn creates an artifical fee market which has lead to transaction chaos.  This creates a nonlevel playing field where other coins can outcompete bitcoin for blockspace capacity and transaction throughput and at lower cost.At what date did this infinite demand for block space occur  was it in ?  no was it in ?  no was it in ?  still no  is it today?  again no  how about tomorrow?  nope well then next year...? no.  This is a nonsense.  regardless of the amount of demand for blockspace there is a cost  a clearly rising cost  associated with forming more and more transactions into a block.  One might as well say there is an infinite demand for icecream  then how come we are not all drowning in icecream.  Transactions have non zero cost  miners will not bloat the blocks just because there are transactions there.  You are advocating crippling bitcoin in the short term which will only serve to continue to strengthen competing coins because you are not worried about the number of transactions next year but at some point further where you worry that there will be billions of transactions all needing to confirm...holy cow  after all these years we are just filling mb.

And you are willing to cripple bitcoin and ruin thee new user experience because of that?  there is time to do a little onchain scaling and continue to work on layer  for the next several years  nothing is stopping people coming up with new ideas and technology  the only thing that is being stopped is an orderly functioning bitcoin network right now.    ,btc,deerryx,7,t5_2si5v

I gave the answer below. segregated witness is a big change from the whitepaper it changes fundamental concepts and outlines of Bitcoin.  it adds a huge more technical debt which will make actually fixing the blocksize problem much much harder than it is right now. it does not actually fix anything regarding scaling it merely pushes the issue off for another  monthsyears but if btc survives we will be back here discussing these same things again but with more difficultly as segregated witness makes solving the blocksize issue much more difficult on a technical level there is a massive absolutely huge amount of misinformation and lies that are being used to try and persuade people to use segregated witness I dont usually like things that have to be lied about to sound good.  segregated witness does not double the block size far from it. In fact bitcoinCore gives an estimate of . or . times the current size which was too small over a year ago if we want to avoid full blocks like Satoshi said we should. They estimate that we could get up to MB with a working LN not yet developed it increases the amount of data that is sent at a higher rate than it increases capacity increasing waste segregated witness as a soft fork includes far more technical debt than as a hard fork which makes all the above problems worse there is no reason why a hardfork would be bad if the supermajority if the hashpower was needed to be using it before it activates such a well prepared fork is just an upgrade the things that segregated witness does do tx malleability can be done with FT or something better than segregated witness or segregated witness as a hard fork to lessen the amount of technical debt that will interfere with a real scalability fixedit this link was just posted its a great explanation of what is going on ,btc,df1t61c,0,t5_2si5v

RelatedgtViewing things this way  realizing that enforcing block validity rules is equivalent to threatening to split from nodes that do not  gives us a new way to look at soft forks and hard forks.gtA soft fork is when nodes start enforcing additional block validity rules that were not previously in force. This involves nodes having to increase the risk that they might cause a split in consensus with other nodes and potentially lower security and confidence in the new validity rules.gtA hard fork on the other hand involves a threat deescalation. Nodes can accept a hard fork change by removing enforcement of a rule.

11276872,0,t1_df97enp,That doesnt change the fact that binaries were released first unsigned and users were encouraged to upgrade to them while source code was being attempted to be withheld for many hours.The fact that they thought this was ok in the first place is unacceptable in and of itself.Bitcoin works because you can point to it and say Go ahead look at that. You dont need to trust me at all because you can see how the math works and what the code does.  You dont have to like me in order to use my software because you can validate it.  And indeed I run code that Lukejr has written.... after I carefully read every fucking line of it to be sure its safe.Now users dont have to do things without trust  they can delegate trust to others and download signed binaries or unsigned binaries even.  They can choose the level of trust they want.  But it starts from a baseline of trustlessness.  The ability to choose your level of trust.So when you remove that baseline and introduce a trustmodel as the bottom layer and say run this software trust me without any other option or opportunity to choose how and where the user can delegate trust you fundamentally break the security model of the entire system.  As Core so often likes to remind us  you cant build a trustless system on top of a trusted base and you cant build a decentralized system on top of a centralized base.  Trustlessness must always be at the foundation otherwise the rest of it is meaningless.So I reiterate the fact that they thought this was remotely ok to begin with is itself completely unacceptable.  It doesnt matter how short a time frame it happened it.  They thought it was ok to do this.  Thats a problem.,btc,dfa7tpv,1,t5_2si5v

Miners set their own blocksize to a level they felt would be accepted by other miners.  They did this quite well for many years until they could not adjust above the M limit.If the M limit were not there why would they risk losing block reward by creating blocks so large that few other miners would accept?The M limit was put in place in v.. of the software.  It was put in place to prevent then free transaction spam.  The intention was that this limit would be lifted before it was reached.  That was the expectation of everyone until a few years ago when Core scared everyone into thinking hard forks are difficult.  Interesting to note that their solution if BU gets adopted is to do a hard fork with a new POW... not so difficult for them but difficult for everyone else.Bitcoin has already had two hard forks and no one noticed.  It is possible and it can be seemless.  Here is some more of todays thread about hard forks    Note the careful wording used a few comments into it. How will we know when we can do a safe hard fork? With Economic Consensus. What is Economic Consensus? We measure hash rate and via price.This is the approach BU is also taking towards gaining consensus hash rate  miner voting but were told it is bad for us to do it but fine for them to do it.  It is not possible to meet their criteria because it changes from day to day.  The big block side has had a consistent message even since we wanted to change a  to a .

The code is closed source and distributed to pools only first. None of the block explorers are updated to the SegWit version. So when they then started to mine every block they found wasnt recognised by the block explorers causing uncertainty as to whether or not the blocks they are finding are accepted. This confusion caused them to reset their software several times to try and debug and troubleshoot it.Syscoins implementation seems to have been a hardfork and not a soft fork.

11431494,0,t1_dfrezfu,gtWe cant wait until Luke is happy that everything is perfect. I agree. But considering as Bitcoin grows it will get more and more difficult to roll out big changes it seems important that we make the most important changes possible. To me LN seems like itll be pretty important to the long term future of Bitcoin. Ive been reading things on both subreddits and people do seem to agree on that at least. But from what I can tell SegWit is needed for LN but bigger blocks arent although if Im wrong here let me know.This compromise is nice because it does some of both but in some ways I understand what people on the other sub are saying when they dismiss bigger blocks. If LN is the future and LN really just needs SegWit then even if you have just a tiny voice in your brain concerned about bigger blocks. youre pretty much going to be opposed to them because why risk any possible problem when you can skip bigger blocks altogether and focus on the thing that will get you to LN which is supposed to fix everything. gtTo clarify None of their arguments is a good reason not to increase the block size cap. You can prove this because as soon as it suited them to lift it with SegWit it suddenly wasnt an insuperable barrier.So politically I think its a bad idea to use this argument. I think many of the Core devs were cajoled into making SegWit a blocksize increase as part of a compromise within Core. Theyre not a monolithic block theyre a diverse group of people just like the people on this sub. If you take the thing that they think they compromised on and use that a reason they should give more youre gonna disincentivize anyone from compromising ever again. And moreover I dont think its going to make sense to people on the other side. If theyre concerned that block size is making it harder to run full nodes and as someone whos been trying to get their Raspberry Pi to download the blockchain for over a week I understand some of the issues they may very well be concerned about what SegWit will do to the size of blocks. Saying that a blocksize increase of X means that an increase of X will also be fine doesnt sound convincing at all. Theyre thinking that the network will be under enough pressure as is without a further blocksize increase which will cause even more validation nodes to drop off. ,btc,dfrqxq4,2,t5_2si5v

The only optimisation is to the profit of one miner at the expense of others by breaking an agreement.It makes mining empty blocks appreciably more efficient than mining blocks with transactions and explains why AntPool mines so many empty blocks relative to other mining pools. In other words it creates perverse mining incentives that hurt Bitcoins transaction capacity no matter how big blocks are able to be. Im sure you are aware already but empty blocks dont take transactions from the mempool and this creates transaction delays and fee increases. Again. nothing very optimising about that again.Any optimisation of the bitcoin protocol itself that commit to a certain order of transactions such as UTXO commitments Committed Bloom filters Committed address indexes STXO commitments nondelayed Weak blocks Most kinds of fraud proofs and not just Segwit would break the covert exploit.How do you see it as optimising mining if the definition of mining is along the lines of Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger or see section   of the whitepaper.,btc,dfwjvr1,0,t5_2si5v

Blocks are  filled to capacity again. Fees are currently USD for onchain transactions. This also means it costs USD to open and close LN channels. However Bank of America will allow you to purchase store and use their LN channels for free however since they are regulated  they must adhere to existing regulations KYCAML so you can only send to approved vendors.I believe banks like this will exist probably either way however we will be forced to use them as it will be cost prohibitive to either open my own LN channels or send value via a L transaction.gt This is a very bad argument.

It gets a discount.This is clear and obvious to everyone and now you are trying to say No no it doesnt get a discount using some twisted interpretation of the words involved and youre trying to say that the people who clearly understand that the signature data gets a discount are confused.Thats not going to convince anybody.

11657886,0,t3_66bss7,It doesnt work that way. I keep seeing this strawman meme repeated by North Corean brainwashing victims.  They keep making a strawman that if segwit goes on litecoin it should fail then because every BU supporter thinks segwit will fail catastrophically instantly where everyone can point to the failure.Its so silly.  It doesnt work that way.  Segwit is a long drawn out failure that occurs over time.  It helps prevent real onchain scaling in the long term by complicateing the system.  Since litecoin capacity isnt even full you wont even notice anything on litecoin it will be a nonevent.  Then North Coreans will claim victory because nothing catastrophically went wrong where we can point to it and say there is the failure.  Then use it as justification to put it on Bitcoin.  Stop with your tricks why cant we have a simple blocksize increase? What is the big deal?Blocking segwit on Litecoin is a smart idea if you want to help block it on Bitcoin.  Activating on litecoin is part of the Dragons Den plan of which Charlie Lee is an admitted member.  So we need to oppose whatever their secret Dragons Den agenda is.Just because the price pumped a bit on litecoin does not mean its good for litecoin in the long term.  What if litecoin adopts segwit but bitcoin does not then the code bases will diverge and litecoin will have to hard fork later to align again with bitcoins codebase.  F pool for example has noted this is a big danger for the long term price of litecoin and that is why Wang Chun of F holds zero litecoin.By your logic any banker can pump the price in order to promote whatever tyranny enhancing improvement they want and miners should jump on board to sabotage the currency.  It doesnt work that way and once again shows the complete lack of understanding of the North Coreans and their brainwashed victims.You seem to try to infer that miners and BU are backed by banks yet its BlockStream core which is funded by AXABilderberg bankers who have a plan for technocratic smart cities  They want to gain control and power over Bitcoin so they can team with governments to track and control it in their technocratic totalitarian system similar to .

If the incentives are not properly configured you can get behaviors you dont want. E.g. something like mining empty blocks because it is more profitable in some situations.. There are more attack vectors than for POW. They all have to be considered and addressed. Extensive work is done in this area but are we sure we found all of them?. What happens if a part of the community decides they want to stay with the old POW tech?

I count as a single transaction a payment from Alice to Bob.  If Alice pays Bob and Charlie then that would be two transactions.  So the number of outputs per transaction is  allowing for change.  So averaged over a long time the number of inputs will be  as well.  In allowing more than  I was adding in a safety factor to prevent reddit wheel spinning.  It also allows for intelligent client optimizations e.g. eating up excessive UTXOs.In estimating throughput there is also the question of multiple actions e.g. read the input then write to cancel it plus create the output.  Then on top of this there are questions of overhead e.g. index structures or hashing.  Plus there are questions of crash safety.   Plus most importantly there is a question of queue depth needed to get high IO rates in the device which implies a high number of threads and possible context switching overhead in the processor.

11709265,0,t1_dgmxnef,gt Its an abuse of a quirk of the way an  byte header is hashed by a  byte hashing algorithm. Its a hack. Its abuse. Once again there is NO rule in the protocol that says how the miners may or must try to solve the PoW puzzle. There is NO logical justification to call some optimizations abusive and others legit.  It makes NO difference to the network whether a miner uses covert AB overt AB or no AB at all.All ASICs abuse a fundamental quirk of bitcoins PoW namely that the SHA computation loop can be unrolled into a pipeline and each stage can implemented as a highly optimized circuit.  That is how a small and simple ASIC can solve the PoW puzzle  times faster than a large generalpurpose CPU. ASICs for scryptbased coins for example abuse different quirks.  The only reason why you call AB an abuse rather than an optimization is because it lets Blockstream now claim that Bitmain is evil because they ... uh ... might be thinking of using covert AB.  Which is obviously evil because Blockstream calls it covert. Asicboost has been public for years.  Why didnt Blockstream call its inventors evil back then?  Because they are Blockstream supporters perhaps?A year or two ago another optimization was published that exploited another quirk of the protocol namely that a miner does not have to try all possible nonces in sequence. So a mining chip could use a simplified adder circuit that was much faster but worked only for some fraction of the nonces.  Why wasnt that optimization denounced as abusive too? ,btc,dgn9wnk,0,t5_2si5v

From what I am seeing  The code is really messy. Yes there is a hardcoded domain name in there define AUTHURL auth.minerlink.com It is used inside of the setupsendmacsocket which is trying to fetch something from that URL. setupsendmacsocket is running in a loop until it assigns true to stopmining global variable. The only place where stopmining variable is used is inside of the readtempfunc. readtempfunc is running as a separate thread emitting the s create thread for read tempn message to the logs. I think it is trying to read some temperature? data from the chip which makes sense. That diagnostics thread stops when stopmining variable is set to true.TLDR it looks like BitMain have the power to stop a diagnostics thread running on the miner. Which is weird quite frankly but I do not see how they can stop the main mining logic.I cant know for sure if I can trust you or Jihan. I dont have the miner to test any of the claims so unless a wellknown BitMain customer confirms the remote shutdown I wont know the test results. But I can hopefully trust the code provided that I understand it correctly. And the code is telling me that yes it is weird but no they cannot shut down the entire miner. Please prove me wrong if you can?Edit all right so it seems setting the stopmining variable has a sideeffect of also setting the statuserror  true and that thing is used in so many places it could indeed blow things up including the shutdown of the entire miner.

EC is a complicated mechanism by which miners signal what limit they have theres a backandforth and then users either agree to accept blocks beyond their expected limits or they dont and thus may fork.This is most definitely NOT the same as not having a limit.Not having a limit would mean blocks of every size are definitely accepted.With the current system we know blocks of up to MB are definitely accepted and blocks beyond that size are definitely not accepted.EC on the other hand means that nobody would ever know which size blocks would be accepted in a weeks time it might be only smaller blocks it might be much larger blocks.,btc,dgteva1,1,t5_2si5v

11765948,0,t1_dgtp689,I just sticking with the original vision that worked very well before blockstream took over and fed you with cool aid. Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification section  to check for double spending which only requires having the chain of block headers or about KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first most users would run network nodes but as the network grows beyond a certain point it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.,btc,dgtp85o,1,t5_2si5v

As I understand automod basically just looks for certain keywords in comments and requires manual approval by a mod if the conditions match.  Kind of like your email spam filter.
