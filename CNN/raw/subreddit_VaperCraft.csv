366902,0,t1_cfimlmx,Rated for a dc. Do the math up and it handles more than Ill ever use. I made a prototype using the same switch and over the course of two weeks of extremely heavy vaping it held up fine. Rated the same as those fancy anti vandal switches everyone likes.,VaperCraft,cfismc6,1,t5_2zexv
