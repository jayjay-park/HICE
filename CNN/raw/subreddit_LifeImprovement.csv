8481050,0,t3_4vs9hw,Honestly I think this isnt a software issue. I simply check my meetings for the day and schedule other stuff. Like  decide what to do about blah blah issue. When I limit it I have made the decision in half an hour. I plan my day every morning at  workimg around meetings in this fashion writing it down in a paper journal. Might help you. Work expands to fit the time allotted the trick is to allot some arbitrary time and stick to it and youll find things can take a lot less time than you think.,LifeImprovement,d61ob61,0,t5_2t7x6
