There were signs in the student union clearly stating that media directly affiliated with Shapiro were prohibited from filming the students. When they expressed this the reporter did not clarify that she was from another media outlet.  It seems like a legal gray area to me but Im not a lawyer. Personally I believe they were justified in rebuffing her and I dont think she would win in court if she accused them of assaulting her.,CSULA,d0gr0mh,1,t5_2s9rz
