2804928,0,t3_2s4jj6,I do the same thing.. the movielife thing though I cant say Id delved as much into it as K did.  The way I look at it is that yes I am the star of my movie  I have my costars my guest stars some alsos and extras... but I guess the way I look at is that everyone I come into contact is the star of their movie.  For them I am just the costar guest star also or extra... so it behooves me to actbehave accordingly  to make their movie good or at least not horrible in that moment.  It makes me feel good. shrug,lordkeanu,cnmwsxt,1,t5_2xk6h
