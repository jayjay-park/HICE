4003756,0,t3_35uxb9,When commenting with advice can we ask that people identify if they are a lawyer or at least give an idea of how reliable their advice is? I know it could get tricky but it would help to know. ,RBNLegalAdvice,crcnr0l,1,t5_387t8
4272375,0,t3_39w0lk,This may be a question better suited for a lawyer.In the wiki there is a page on seeking out and being referred to a lawyer. They are usually either cheap or free for the first  minutes.If you seriously expect him to consult a lawyer you should probably be doing the same as well.best of luck.,RBNLegalAdvice,cs77pos,2,t5_387t8

7349001,0,t1_d2dj1nx,You cant as far as I know. Even the insurance people dont really know. Every  months when you renew they recalculate the rates and they wont know the result until that time. If youve had the same insurance for a long time they may forgive the first accident. That may or may not be spelled out on your policy.,RBNLegalAdvice,d2dj4nc,1,t5_387t8

8393107,0,t3_4uh42t,Sorry your friend is going through all this. I dont have much advice except that maybe he could at least get his social security number from his doctor? Can he tell them in confidence that he is trying to escape an abusive situation and he needs help because his guardians are withholding documents? Maybe theyd be willing to give him that since they know who he is and wont need ID to check. I know he needs the card too but just having the number could help too.I know the police can also serve as escorts on the day he decides to leave. If the documents are in the house having the police back him up could scare the Ns into giving him the documents. At the very least it would provide another eye witness if they try and pull any shenanigans. ,RBNLegalAdvice,d5qoowi,3,t5_387t8
9867734,0,t3_5gn356,In America we are generally not in the business of regulating ones feelings sexual or otherwise. Just as an example if someone got sexual pleasure from watching people eat should they be removed and punished for masterbating to their mental images otherwise? If the person is being abusive that is illegal. Getting sexual gratification from nontraditional sources thankfully is not illegal. Psychologically this is strange as are most kinks but psychology doesnt align with the law.,RBNLegalAdvice,datsebg,3,t5_387t8
