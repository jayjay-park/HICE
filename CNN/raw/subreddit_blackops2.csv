Plus you get twice the mag size as the DSR and the semi auto close range backup. That being said when using the bolt actions in core the key is staying calm and focusing on one person at a time. Let your shots connect and continue onto your next target. I take it youre sniping traditionally so like stated you want to get the biggest threat down first. If youre quickscoping you just need to be calm and focus on making those shots connect. Usually if youre QS is good enough you can get the jump on two people easy.,blackops2,cgam03u,3,t5_2sqqn

1507600,0,t3_2bgpsu,Hacking is a broad term enabling proper multiGPU support and having an aimbot are both forms of hacks. I support all forms of hacking that doesnt take away from someone elses experience or gives you an unfair advantage. If it improves the game for you and in the case of mods your friends then go for it.Cheating is always bad theres no justification for it.Boosting is lame but at the end of the day it just gets you item X faster than you would normally. If it ruins an otherwise good TDM game then its bad if its two players not bothering anyone else then I dont see a problem with it.Same for rank hacks you just ruin the fun for yourself and dont gain an advantage over anyone if the game is properly balanced. I feel that the people complaining about it do so because of buyers remorse they have invested X number of hours into getting item Y and when someone else gets it without any effort they feel cheated like they did all the work for nothing. Which is a pretty bad attitude towards a game treating it like a chore.Aside for that I dont think anyone here would argue in favor of cheats its more an argument about whats a reasonable punishment. Over the past week or so people have gotten banned from their game for having usernames the sub doesnt like banned for modifying the game even though they didnt got banned from twitch because the sub didnt like that heshe used a modded lobby probably in a custom game but banned because people spammed false reports and accused several people of supporting cheating just because they didnt agree that IP banning  IP addresses to punish one guy would be fair.If you dare say that something isnt a cheat is not against the TOS or just say that a permanent ban from the game should be enough then people will look at your post history and downvote everything. Thats the circlejerk here not supporting capital punishment for cheating in games means that you support cheating.On a personal note I dont care much for the cheat reports here and the general attitude towards cheaters. Theres a metric tonne of them out there and reporting  a week here and patting yourselves on the back for getting them banned wont solve anything. In my mind its the responsibility of the developers to maintain their client and patch cheats. We get a lot of updates for DLC but rarely anything that makes it harder to cheat. If the company actually took some pride in their product rather than milking the customers then there wouldnt be as many cheaters and the game would be better.Now cue the downvotes..,blackops2,cj593zh,16,t5_2sqqn

1795677,0,t1_ck4zidb,In my opinion snipers should be mostly unusable at close ranges just as shotguns are unusable at long ranges. Making a weapon effective at both long and short ranges is the definition of overpowered. Any one who says Snipers require skill to use closerange so if they have practiced with it enough they deserve the kill isnt thinking properly. Thats like saying Given enough skill its fair if shotguns can kill at long ranges. No one would want that and its the same thing with snipers except the longshort range ability is reversed. The fact that snipers even have laser sights available as attachments doesnt make sense. Why would you want it to be easier to hip fire with a sniper? If they are supposed to be long range weapons hip firing should not be made easy AT ALL. Sometimes I wonder how Treyarch didnt realize this when making the game. So much time and effort creating the game and polishing the mechanics but somehow they missed something so obvious. Sorry if it sounds like Im ranting but snipers being OP is pretty much my only gripe with this game except for the occasional bullets curving around corners but that I can live with. Its not THAT bad. Snipers being OP disrupt and ruin the flow of the game with me enough that its made me takes hiatuses from the game altogether. Ive always been a FFA player so it makes the sniper situation particularly bad. FFA is crawling with people sniping. ,blackops2,ck5hsot,2,t5_2sqqn

2465374,0,t3_2nn25k,I just finished this challenge! Im a huge fan of the guardian and believe that it might be the most underrated scorestreak. I used UAV  Hunter killer and then guardian. The key for this challenge is to camp out your guardian. Otherwise I place it around a corner where it blocks off one of the  lanes and then wait for someone to sprint full force into it and die! Yea people use EMPs all the time but some of the filthiest kills Ive ever had are from the guardian. Fav maps for guardian are Plazain the disco area is great Slums Nuketown and aftermath. Place you guardian put your back to it so you can kill everyone that isnt running into it and when someone does run into the guardian then you can quickly kill turn back and kill them. Its all about closing a lane. You can get way more points than a sentry gun would and its less noticeable. My dream kill is a quad kill with guardian. Microwaves for life! Also try pairing smoke with your guardian.,blackops2,cmgf5jd,1,t5_2sqqn

TDM  FFA whenever I want to play on DLC maps its just filled wit snipers tac inserting their asses off. I cant stress enough how much more common snipers are on DLC maps. if you play groundwardomination on grind prepare to hear the word SNIPER a lot AND INSTADIE A LOT. I still enjoy the game a lot with or without DLC and after playing on stock maps for soo long it was really nice to see a different scenery and play some maps for the first time. btw studios probably one of my favourite maps on BO right behind raid. Takeoffs also really cool.

I go into Hardcore Kill Confirmed and Im jumping from map to map from DLCS to DLC. On core they will be even more popular. If you are wondering whether to get them or not get them!

3797344,0,t3_33tlkk,Try to win but if youre good and still lose its not bad. You could get a lot of minus points but it shouldnt have a bad effect on your division. Play against good players. Its better to lose against good players than to win against bad players. And now some strategies when playing with bad teammates Hardpoint Let the teammates go into the hardpoint and try to slay dont let the enemies rush. You have a clear advantage when you know where the enemies come from or spawn. Capture You have to be extremely good take the flag and know where enemies come from. So you have to carry your entire team and do everything on your own. SnD Easy. Tactic and weapon depends on map. But if the enemies dont overrush you should get em all in v situations. When you have to defend get a good spot e.g. laundry kebab. From laundry Raid DSR with MSMC Overkill or AN only or MSMC only you can hearwatch the bomb your back red house red ring and mid. From kebab Standoff AN only or MSMC only you can hearwatch the bomb brown house your spawn both tanks from the corner you can watch if someone rushes from tractor to your spawn and gas station. And you should hear all enemies climbing or knifing the glass. Id recommend playing with Dead Silence and Awareness.,blackops2,cqp4ldg,1,t5_2sqqn
