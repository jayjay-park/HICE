1717322,0,t1_cjvm3wn,gt As long as unilingual english speaking NBers continue to be discriminated against Ahhh ok this is where I figured this was going. French people are not the reason Anglophone NBers cant find jobs. Its not easy for Francophones either and the northern mostly French part of the province is the most economically depressed part of the country. The terrible state of the provincial economy is in part because of a horrible education system that churns out functional illiterates in both official languages a moribund industrial base a provincial government that deals in patronage for their friends instead of finding real economic solutions for the province an uncompetitive tax system... you name it its a bigger problem than bilingualism. Bilingualism is an easy scapegoat for a lot of people because its in your face and its menacing in a globalizing world not because English is becoming more dominant but instead multilingualism becomes more and more of a requirement to communicate with clients across the globe.,newbrunswickcanada,cjvmqho,1,t5_2r62y

4307857,0,t1_csb706w,Thanks for pointing that out. Actually what you see now is an updated version of the story. Even the title has changed. The title I posted was the original. The CBC subsequently changed the story after I read it. They really should have created a new article. Perhaps the government noticed the deluge of negative comments below the original story and that persuaded them to reject the proposal. ,newbrunswickcanada,csb7yz8,2,t5_2r62y

7608466,0,t3_4jg15u,Buyers remorse. I know this isnt a great metaphor but imagine you went to the car dealership and bought a brand new car for k. The next day your neighbor comes home with a brand new car and tells you that the dealership was just giving them out! Of course youre going to wish you had gotten the same deal as him or at least that you knew that the giveaway was happening because then you would have had the choice to hold off on your purchase for a day. Im graduating this year and although it just seems jealous and greedy of the recent grads its not hard to understand why people are upset. You just spent tens of thousands of dollars on your education taking on a crippling debt only to watch the next group of people come in and get it for free. Of course there are more expenses to school than tuition but its still a huge chunk of change for anyone even more so for  year olds. And of everyone who already paid their tuition and those who havent ever studied beyond high school now shoulder the burden of these students educations. I still believe its a step in the right direction and I understand that the line has to be drawn somewhere but I also see why people are upset. I just hope that with free tuition that the government cracks down on needless spending and corruption at universities. At Mount Allison University not only does the president make a salary similar to CEOs but the university has run a profit of several million dollars for the last several years and still they increase tuition and nickel and dime the students to death with additional fees whenever the government tells them they cant raise tuition. I understand that you might need to run small profits to keep some money in the bank to cover unexpected expenses and stuff but to run things like a steamlined buisness is really just an insult to academia. Side note its funny how when classes are cancelled for nearly a month and the students demand a refund the school says oh shame on you for only thinking about money. This isnt a buisness youre here to learn and to broaden your horizons not buy a degree but whenever theyre questioned about increasing or adding new fees the reply is usually well you have to think of the university as a buisness. Were only barely covering costsbullshit and we would like to be making more comfortable profits.Anyway enough ranting for me.,newbrunswickcanada,d371k42,3,t5_2r62y

8486812,0,t1_d62dyd8,First things first this area is flagged off as restricted access or something by the Province. They dont want you going there. If I had to guess why its because the trail isnt maintained and is moderately strenuous but I honestly have no idea. The underground lake is actually a lake underneath a gypsum hill. You can swim in it but its damn cold. Edit Video of scramble down to the lakes edgeThe caves are a combination of old mine shafts in the gypsum fields and eroded caves. Again these are not maintained in anyway so they are probably technically dangerous. But what adventure isnt dangerous! You can seriously spend a day in these caves. Its a pretty huge system.
