848529,0,t3_1uuxt5,If youre talking about the actual dancing at the nightclubs the answer is that you blend in better there. The people assume you have body modifications and are in costume. Or they are familiar with vampires may even be a ghoul and they keep their mouths shut. These are assumptions I made by extrapolating from the NPC characters who have dialog and applying the same lore to the nonconversational NPCs. It is somewhat implied that Jeanette Voerman keeps ghouls for instance.,vtmb,ch0qcvp,3,t5_2tat3

Also the telephone wires keep jiggling everywhere. Is that normal? Like should the fires be bluepurple and should the telephone wires be having seizures?,vtmb,cpubp69,1,t5_2tat3

The unofficial patch now has to be called on launch are you playing the game via steam? if so you need to add game UnofficialPatch to the launch options if you dont use the shortcut the patch creates for you.,vtmb,cyf0s8b,1,t5_2tat3

8707471,0,t1_d62adev,udreamoftheendless Whats so unfinished about the Werewolf fight?? I never had that perspective from my first playthrough  years ago.  I dont see how you can complain about it at all because. Its SUPPOSE to be difficult  Werewolves are INCREDIBLY powerful. I had to wait for the next trolley..  That worked just fine.I dont get your complaint?!,vtmb,d6u2i0r,1,t5_2tat3

If anyone have some experience and could help or provide some information on how to run this game with mod TFN or Antitribu on windows  would help me out so much since i really want to play this game its lore so rich and has unmatchable interest of mine to experience it.,vtmb,d718yoz,1,t5_2tat3
8860559,0,t3_51hwkk,As I understand it you CAN get the body armor elsewhere it will simply cost a lot of money. If you tell Heather to leave then she wont give the body armor however you should be able to buy the armor off of Mercurio who also deals in the highestend weapons. Therefore its no longer a question of whether or not you CAN get the armor it becomes a question of whether or not you pay for it. FWIW the armor does give a penalty to Dexterity which affects lockpicking and sneaking. My recommendation use the body armor. When you get to an area where you need to sneak or pick a lock then temporarily switch to a lighter set of clothes then switch back once you are past. The simple truth is that  protection is nothing to sneeze at.,vtmb,d7cwx5b,2,t5_2tat3

9504634,0,t1_d9eywzr,Just about everyone you normally can talk to can be talked to. A handful of characters smug rich guy in Santa Monica for example wont have as many options and will run screaming if you persist in trying to talk to them but you can usually figure those out at the outset.,vtmb,d9knd03,1,t5_2tat3
9557611,0,t1_d9qutto,Well they are more of a stealth game but the first game of the series is one of my all time favorites.  I think story wise they couldnt really be more different but gameplay wise they are both very replayable games with a cool skill system that makes you stronger in the ways you want to tailor your character to your playstyle.  The sequels to Deus Ex are even more stealth games as they have real cover systems and guard paths you have to figure out if you want to get through without anyone seeing you etc.  You can run and gun if you want but its not really a game designed for that as much as the first one is.,vtmb,d9r673i,3,t5_2tat3
