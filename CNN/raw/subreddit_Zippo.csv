204112,0,t3_1wgack,What makes you say the insert looks genuine stamping from what I can see in the blur looks to be correct is there a roman numeral E means May  on each side of the zippo lettering? The filling port on the bottom looks spot on box is real and of course its not so hard to fake. But what makes you think it is fake?,Zippo,cf1ox70,3,t5_2t1o8

235788,0,t3_1wrpn0,Dont use gasoline... Stick with lighter fluid. Zippo will customize your lighter for you so you can put a logo on it if you want and theyll engrave it or put vinyl on it I believe. Otherwise check eBay.,Zippo,cf56ti9,2,t5_2t1o8

1427745,0,t1_cipoyqf,Not sure about the anywhere at any age part. Bought a Zippo and some fluid the other day at Wal Mart and the zippo scanned through no age verification. Fluid goes over Is customer over ? The cashier and I were a bit amused the fluid required ID but not the lighter but i guess Im not starting any fires without fluid is the thought process. May just be a Wal Mart policy though.,Zippo,civ8ub9,2,t5_2t1o8

10275061,0,t3_5mlpku,Also if you find something you like dont hesitate to buy a broken one.  Zippo has an unconditional lifetime transferable guarantee.I found one on ebay once it was an early s zippo that had some customization from the original owner on it but the lid was broken it was held on with a paper clip.  I paid . for it sent it to Zippo within a week I had it back good as new!  Bought a Barcroft Model  the chimney was crushed the lid was almost falling off and the rivet holding the wheel in was pretty beat up I took it to them to have it fixed was in the area.  I was there for  minutes the lady I gave it to came back out and said We reattached the lid for you but the technicians cannot fix the insert we dont have the parts to be able to fix it and this is a pretty rare piece we dont want to do anything to it that could damage it please accept this brand new lighter as an apology.  Zippos customer service is second to none.  If you dont have a hell of a lot of cash starting out and the vintage ones really call out to you like they do to me broken is a great place to start!ETA Pro Tip  If you ever have to send a lighter back to Zippo for service include a letter asking for a pipe insert.  Standard procedure for them is to fix the case and give you a new insert returning your old one to you as well.  If you ask for a pipe insert then when you get it back you will have  of each pipenormal so you can use whichever you prefer and switch at will.,Zippo,dc8qfdb,2,t5_2t1o8
