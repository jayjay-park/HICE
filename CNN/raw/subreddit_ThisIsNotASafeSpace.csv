5764140,0,t1_cxbkw4l,In the comments section there is some evidence that the shots were fired in self defense.  Im not saying I agree with that evaluation of the situation because I dont know yet.  I am following the various links and putting information together in my mind and for the time being reserving judgement.  I do agree though if it turns out that this was an unprovoked attack by white supremacists we all need to condemn the actions.,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,cxblfa3,9,t5_3atj7
5765952,0,t1_cxbsyrv,A university president cant cancel classes without saying anything. If he suggested there were a nondescript investigation there would be a minor shitstorm followed by another when the investigation concludes and it turns out he was covering up anything to do with a racially inclined incident. Ignoring the issue altogether in this particular climate is a one way ticket to get piles of people sitting in your office until you quit or get fired. This guy wants his job. Probably wants to be hip with the cool kids. For his own sake he has taken a pretty good course of action even if it comes to nothing. Like I said before nipping this in the bud and putting out the opportunity to express outrage together is a good tactic to keep your kids from rioting and will probably pacify the whiners enough to keep them from making some of the same stupid demands that weve seen before. ,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,cxbticr,1,t5_3atj7

5913674,0,t1_cxurm6i,gt African American communities have very little emphasis on education there are many absentee parents there is a reverence of athletes and artists the one in a million cases instead of hard working blue collar members of society no real regard for reasonable family size and a myriad of other culture issues that stack the cards against minority children. But pointing out these issues is inherently racist and the real problem is the white establishment in the eyes of the protesters.Again as minority myself I cant even touch these topics with African Americans lest I be labeled a whitesupremacy sympathizer or racist myself.Were going to get nowhere with this dancing and tiptoeing around these nuanced issues.  Sad state of affairs when you look at a supposed topprestigious school of the nation also unable to have thoughtful amp open discussion on the matters.Latinos and Asians?  Both very strong emphasis on the core family unit and support.  Im guessing this plays a huge role as well.gt Until the BLM protestors recognize the faults of their own community and work to address them I am staunchly against making any sort of compromise with them or supporting their movement because it is akin to giving a cookie to a petulant child.Totally agree here I wouldnt budge one bit.  Budging at their every whim has put this nation where it is now and it might take a heck of a lot of work to steer it back on course.  Parents deal with this behavior a lot some are more resilient to such tantrums.gt To ask you a question back the SC is reviewing Affirmative Action. What are your opinions on affirmative action? Was it correct to implement in the first place?  No opinion and dont really know the answer a bit before my time.  Maybe the original reasoning made sense? Speaking purely from my experiences  years on this Earth there is no place for affirmative action in our society.  While this may make it harder for those minorities that currently benefit I dont know how were going to move forward as a society as a nation if we grant benefits to one group of people at the expense of another.  This is not my kind of equality. Justice Scalias words were rather blunt and maybe offbase maybe because hes an old conservative dude from Ronald Reagans admin. but if I looked at what he said through the scope of the reality Ive experienced it very much aligns with what Ive seen.  It makes no sense to put Blacks into more prestigious schools where they continue to feel disenfranchised and oppressed anyway and ask for more handouts.  Again a firm no to the coddling and giving into their demands. My previous sentiment was that as a human being as another minority I think Affirmative Action allows lazy fucks to take the places of hardworking and more deserving students.  Diversityinclusiveness be damned it should totally be about ones own merit and hard work.  I dont think Justice Scalias words will be well received they might have crossed a line not any line of mine though.  Then again to those that are offended by his words fuck em.   Probably a lot of typos mobile.,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,cxutctq,2,t5_3atj7
5943129,0,t1_cxyo51v,Wait do you work at Yale?  I ask because I didnt experience undergrad over there. My undergrad experience was a traditional southern college vandy so none of this SJW bullshit even really had a voice.  I was SAE over there and we didnt get into trouble nearly as much as these guys.  Is there something about Yale and these prestigious northern schools or something?  I honestly feel like there is a distinct difference between my undergrad and grad experience right now.  I just cant place it and its definitely not the northsouth rivalry. ,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,cxyoa1n,2,t5_3atj7

7741824,0,t1_d3m57r7,What an odd comparison. This isnt an educational classroom nor is it a private business which operates on the premise that people who are making obnoxious noises would literally ruin the business. This is a sub that claims to not be a safe space from different ideas. Ideas relating to race gender and other social topics. Nazism and its related branches relate to and comment on those three categories. Are proNazi prowhite posts hateful? Yes. The thing is hate speech is free speech.I totally agree with moderating comments that specifically attack another user. As well as moderating content that is irrelevant to the sub which I gave an example to what irrelevant content would be in one of my earlier posts. But in terms of somebody sharing a Daily Stormer article or making a post about how AsianAmericans are ruining the American economy thats not something that should be removed if this sub claims to not be a safe space.I cant say it enough hate speech is free speech. Unfortunately when people decide to create a space where ideas that they think are wrong arent allowed that is a safe space. Just because I think their ideas are hateful that doesnt mean that their ideas dont relate to social topics.My point was that it isnt a safe space but clearly you and others feel that my statements are just me trying to irritate others in a childish manner. Which thats not what it is at all. Civil debate where you disagree with one side doesnt make that side you disagree with the whiny idiot side.EDIT Also Ive been called childish yet Im the one along with uTheHat the first who responded to me who has managed to respond without my response consisting mostly of baseless insults.
