3735,0,t3_1u5wwi,I was in the same boat at the beginning of this year. I had done some college in the past but was never focused. After spending years bouncing from job to job I wanted a change.I started back at the local community college this past semester and got all As first time!. I too am majoring in political science and have come to find that its a pretty transferable major. Since it teaches you how to think critically about situations it works for many careers.Please note that my life is quite different. I have two kids a wife and I work full time. I was still able to do all my school work and succeed. And trust me Im no genius. If you want something put the effort in and you wont be sorry. Thats what I have learned. I wanted to go back to school and I wanted to do well. I put in the effort and it payed off. Dont hold yourself back with fear or anxiety. You can do it. Its a very achievable goal as long as you put the effort in.And like the other commenter said make small goals. Work on each task individually and set weekly or even daily goals. Thats how I got through it. Good luck and happy new year. ,LifeProTips,ceev2nr,2,t5_2s5oq

89916,0,t1_ceoni5y,Hm.. thats tricky because I normally dont eat in the mornings just coffee.  I go without coffee though when I do morning workouts.  I have a hard time eating early in the day anyway so it was actually better for me when I finished my thing to get a smoothie.  When not working out I would always take a naked juice to work with me.  I would use that as a substitute for food.  Maybe find your favorite smoothie amp drink it on the way to the gym?  With that said... Ive been bitched at so many times that a naked juice isnt a meal replacement amp I should have a granola bar or yogurt with it but for someone who would just as easily skip lunch it worked best for me.  Ive also been told naked juices arent as good for you as they pretend to be but I mean theyre better than a burger or pizza.  The best thing you can do is make a smoothie from fresh ingredients the night before to grab on your way out the door.  That might help with the feeling heavy amp gross as well.  Fruits amp veggies are pretty filling without weighing you down.  Ive personally found drinking my meals to be much easier amp more efficient.  For me at least.

So one day on a crowded public bus I asked my mom why the man next to us was so dirty. My moms reply was People come in all colors sweetheart just like flowers.gtAt about the same age I had a fear of my closet. Many nights passed with my mom chasing a monster out of my closet or out from under my bed. Thinking of a way to end this she came into my room one last time. I was crying about the monster in my closet so she calmly walked over and opened it halfway. Bending down and looking into the closet she said Oh no. The monster is crying. She paused and looked at me. Poor little monster. Hes crying because he has no friends. Everybody is scared of him because of how he looks. But he just wants to have a friend. Hes very sad that everyone runs away from him. She paused again and said He says his name is Loolie. Can you be his friend? I said yes and my mom let the monster out of the closet. I scooted over in bed and lifted the covers for the poor little monster. My fear was gone.gtA little older I asked my mom if Santa Clause was real it was time. My mom told me that long ago there was a man named Mr. Clause who lived in a small town. Once a year he made shoes and toys for children in the village who needed them. The children never knew who it was but the moms and dads did. The man did this every year and the children were happy. Many years later the old man died. The moms and dads were very sad because they knew how happy he made the children. So they decided to do it themselves and every year they would make toys and shoes for other children. Long ago Santa Clause was real but now mommies and daddies get to be Santa and give toys to their children.,LifeProTips,ceqvswo,3,t5_2s5oq

Dont slam the brakes. Gently turn the wheel into the direction your cars tail is sliding.

246536,0,t3_1www1v,th year medical student here almost doctor.  Getting to sleep faster will be easier if you practice good sleep hygiene.  Ill summarize what weve been taught to tell our patients most is already posted here but this should be a onestopshopAvoid alcohol and caffeine after pm.  Some people are used to drinking a serving of alcohol before bed and claim that they wont sleep if they dont get it.  They are right initially as withdrawal from alcohol can keep you awake.  However if they were to just cut the nightly alcohol out completely after a few days they would find themselves sleeping better and feeling more rested.Exercise daily.   minutes moderate exercise  PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON HERE FOR YOUR OVERALL HEALTH.Avoid napping during the day.  You need to be on a good sleep schedule.  Forget those intermittent studies that popup on facebook about how humans naturally should be napping in short intervals throughout the day and their like.  Avoid electronics for about an hour before you want to go to sleep.  Even thoughtless electronics such as television have been shown to keep your mind from sleeping after turning them off.Take the TV out of the bedroom.  Related to the above post but more importantly YOUR BEDROOM SHOULD BE YOUR PLACE OF REST AND SOLITUDE.  Dont watch TV get on your iPhone do work on your laptop pay bills etc. etc. in your bedroom.  Your mind needs to correlate your bed with sleep.Try not to eat or drink for a while before bedtime.  Your GI tract having to move large amounts of foodbeverage through it will keep you awake seems counterintuitive as I LOVE eating a shitton on Thanksgiving and passing the hell out.  Good for a rare nap bad for nightly sleep.Dont exercise for at least two hours before bedtime.  It ramps up your fightflight response  no good for sleep.Thats all I remember.

267193,0,t1_cf8fszi,what OP means is that it helps with getting out of your comfort zone. Having the physical discomfort of a cold shower in the morning is rather uncomfortable and gives a nice contrast to most uncomfortable situations.Say youre normally too scared to speak up at a meeting or social gathering. Have a cold shower in a morning and the discomfort of speaking up seems tiny in comparison at least for some people. Makes it easier to put yourself out there. I also think this is a factor in why going to a gym improves your confidence. It gets you used to pushing through the discomfort of a situation.Hope this helps ,LifeProTips,cf8gdgd,2,t5_2s5oq

Vacuum every corner every seam and every other nook and cranny.  Flip everything over several times and suck up every live bug you can find.  Vacuum the bedframe the floor etc.Then coat the mattress corners box spring corners and where the box spring sits in the frame with a good dusting of diatomaceous earth.  Coat the areas where the brown poopeggs are especially well.The diatomaceous earth dries everything out...any adult bedbugs nymphs or eggs left over from the vacuuming will dessicate and die in short order.  The food grade version is non toxic to humans and pets is long acting and inexpensive.Repeat the process after about two weeks and your problem is solved.  Minor infestations might only require one treatment.  Severe ones might take more.,LifeProTips,cfsy5vc,10,t5_2s5oq

489566,0,t1_cfvur2b,Kids are told starting in grade school that the only way to really be successful is to go to college. Its instilled in them that going to college is the normal thing to do the good thing to do and the thing that only losers dont do. Up until the recession they were also told that as long as they worked hard and got good grades theyd get a good job and so the loans were a good investment. Taking out loans is just presented as part of the process.The big disconnect that occurred is when the millenials who had absolutely no reason to doubt their teachersparentsloan officers got out into the job market during the recession and realized that entrylevel clerk jobs suddenly required their college degrees and anything better than that required multiple years of experience. They had been told getting good grades would make them succeed had worked hard to make those good grades and then found out theyd been lied to  partly unintentionally as many could not have predicted the economic downturn weve seen and many older people were still used to the system of the eighties and nineties where a college degree really did mean more than an entrylevel job. And so those loans that everyone agreed were reasonable  years ago were suddenly unbearable and thats where many people are at now.,LifeProTips,cfvx0zj,6,t5_2s5oq

570536,0,t1_cg53h7p,gtTheres absolutely zero reason to think its anything but an emergent property of the increase in the number of neurons.I think you might be right on this point. However this is actually what Im wondering. Is it really just an emergent property of increased number of neurons? Is it as simple as more neurons? Where is the limit and what defines it?gtIts disingenuous to assume there is any other ingrained goal for humans other than to exist. Unless you want to get into religion thats a whole other discussion.There is no ingrained goal youre right. The question is can the goal or purpose we created be considered the same as an ants? A dog lives to be happy which is by making his master happy Im assuming. A human lives to be happy whether it is true self sacrifice or through greed varies. An ant though it only lives to live. No emotion in terms of love exists. Fear doesnt either. The reaction exists but there is a noticeable difference in the way they feel fear and we do. I am trying to pinpoint the difference and Im not sure whether it exists or not. Im leaning towards anything less advanced than a mammal dogs dolphins cats and humans come to mind is simply not alive the same way we are when you look at it purely based on reason. That cutting trees killing ants destroying whole colonies of bees doesnt matter as long as it doesnt come back to hurt us in the long run. However this is a very egotistical way of thinking... albeit rational it seems.gtNo OED sentient Able to perceive or feel thingsI agree that looking at dictionaries to understand words used before continuing to use them is a great way to keep the language clear. I usually do that before using a word important to my discussion if I dont have a full grasp on it. However it being sentience that were discussing the meaning of the word is also open to discussion.gtGiven the above definition its a very different discussion. Whether an ant senses its environment and responds in the way a rock cannot for example is a very different discussion about whether it feels bad about accidentally tripping Ant  last Friday.I am sorry but I dont think I understand what you mean S. Yes an ant is living because it has genes which produce more advanced chemical reactions than abiotic material does. However does an ant feel sad for doing that? Well it doesnt. We know that. We know that an ant doesnt possess the capability to actually feel sad for tripping another ant... at least the way we feel sad. However does their version of sad also count. Is it purely chemical like acid rain melting certain types of rocks or is it advanced enough to be counted as sentient thought... like some of our own chemical reactions are.gtYou have no intent for your actions only instruction. This is becoming a free will argument and while youre free to do research on your own Ill cut this part of it short by saying there is the illusion of free will but you are not the author of your actions any more than the ant is though you may be more consciously aware of them.I think you are wrong about this. Although I cant say for certain as this is the main point of this discussion but from what Ive seen I have an intent behind everything I do and there is one main difference between my intent and their intent which is purely genetical. It is that mine comes from experience. My genome sets the template of happy sad and afraid through hormones. Anything else though I try to understand by processing my memories. My memories my experience actually defines what I think about something. I dont eat veggies because theyre healthy. I either eat them because I have a friend who died from some random disease caused by lack of veggies in diet or I flat out dont eat any because I like other things better things Ive seen advertised on tv therefore theyre cool.

636074,0,t3_21ewed,No no no no no!  This is stupid advice and people who follow it will regret it years later.  The purpose of brushing your teeth is to brush them well not brush them for a long time.  Being distracted and taking too long significantly increases the likelihood that youre going to wear down your gums which later in life can be as bad or worse than cavities.  Brushing too hard not concentrating on what youre doing and brushing too long all lead to wear on your gums.Once theyve receded you become more likely to have problems with tooth decay in your roots way worse than a cavity on the crown of your tooth sensitivity to hot and cold and possibly even recession bad enough to require painful and expensive surgery.Do not follow this advice.

Salmonella . Escherichia coli OH . and all others less than ..Importantly refrigerated poultry will likely develop more bacteria faster than unrefrigerated beef.  So it is essential to either keep it cold or hot as much as possible.  Often when you prepare it you add growth mediums like mayonnaise.What you should also consider is that meat will often get bacteria from you specifically your hands which generally have a dense layer of coliform fecal bacteria on them.If you check the cooking directions for meats often they suggest medium welldone internal temperatures that while they kill the bacteria make the meat taste nasty.,LifeProTips,cgcxlzf,7,t5_2s5oq

A good boss spends months trying to improve someone. A bad boss creates a work environment where they fire employees giving impossible expectations setting them up to fail etc. A good boss creates a work environment where employees fire themselves setting reasonable and appropriate expectations that when missed result in further discipline. Both bosses can use write ups and demerits but both to very different ends depending on how good they are at what they do. Recognize those differences and you will recognize whether a boss is worth your continued employment. But this LPT has NOTHING to do with the USE of a discipline system but HOW that system is used.

664775,0,t3_21r1fc,Many great suggestions in this thread.  One change in perception you might try is this when you do make a mess by letting things get a bit out of hand when you clean it up notice how little time it actual takes.  Compare the lets say  minutes it took to clean up your room with the feeling of looking around at a neat tidy room.  Think about dividing those  minutes into a week and it becomes nothing at all.  Keeping things neat isnt hard work its just a regular thing you attend to.Another change in perception is to think about the powerful impact that a neat tidy apartment or house has on friends family and most importantly the people youd really like to have sex with.  Nothing says life out of control or crazy like obvious hoarding or visible trash lying around.So you clean your messes up people conclude you have your shit together.  Its not actually true but its a very common conclusion that youd like people to make about you.,LifeProTips,cgfu1jo,3,t5_2s5oq

818519,0,t1_cgx078b,I wont even bother down voting your comment as someone else already did. I will just point out that the term commercial mower refers to a mower that is used by a landscaping business for use in mowing residential lawns. Typically what we refer to as a zero turn mower which has individual hydraulic controls for each wheel as opposed to say a steering wheel like a ride on tractor you see grandpa mowing the lawn with. Commercial mower does not refer to a mower used to mow commercial properties.  I use the same style of mowers as any landscaping business. There are several brands  Scag Exmark Bobcat Wright are some of the brands. I personally use Scags with either a  inch or  inch width such as this one which is my  stander. Secondly you would not sue me out of business. Your window would be replaced through the liability insurance that I carry which insures me in the event of property damage.  Which in several years of being in business for myself I have never had to actually use because I am extremely careful and safety conscious of people in the area and items that may be buried in the lawn and potentially become a projectile.  Ill just be sitting here waiting for an apology.  Cheers. ,LifeProTips,cgxbgtc,3,t5_2s5oq

922558,0,t1_ch92uxs,Absolutely! The ASPCA and Jackson Galaxy both make huge points of not letting your cats play with your hands and feet.Heres how it goes for most people. You let your kitten play by chasing your hands and feet batting at them and grabbing them because its adorable!. You giggle and smile and let them play unintentionally rewarding them for this behavior. Cats are hunters. When they are playing they are actually hunting. You are teaching them its okay to hunt your hands and feet.. Your kitten never grows out of this behavior because you taught them it was okay and that is how they should be playing. As an adult cat they now have play aggression and will run around the house attacking your legs feet hands head etc when they are trying to play with you. Many people accept cats attacking scratching and biting as a normal part of having a cat. This simply isnt true. If you never encourage them to play with your body parts they will never try to play with them. And then you will never get scratched unless something else is wrong. It really is that easy.Proper play time  minutes a day interactive toys like dangly feather rods ideally not laser pointers guide the toy away from your body and let them hunt. At the end of the play session your cat should be laying down and acting like they need a minute to rest. ,LifeProTips,ch95faj,1,t5_2s5oq

S. aureus definitely secretes exotoxins that would lead to the symptoms youre describing. But in this case its remove the bacteria remove the threat. For bacteria to produce enough exotoxin to harm you think about the chain of events that would have to happen. Moist environment on a sponge ok thats fair. Maybe theres enough food particles for the bacteria to even survive on the sponge. But someone would have to wipe a disgustingly large amount of well growing bacteria on their plate dip their food in it and eat it to get exposure. Boiling the bacteria removes the threat on a practical daytoday level. On a practical level no one is going to use a moldy sponge anyways. Itd be thrown out. But smaller unseen fungus would definitely be killed by boiling water  microwave. And as for prions I dont even know why you mentioned them. Prioninduced diseases result from intracellular problems.

1090652,1,t3_26l4bb,Gasoline. Theres no point in paying extra for the higher octane grades. With only a few small exceptions our modern day cars are designed to operate on the lower grades and receive no benefit in performance or fuel efficiency from using the higher grades. Edit Apparently my suggestion about saving money with your fuel costs is getting missed about how to quantify a few small exceptions which does nothing to benefit the OPs original request. Since I apparently dont know what Im talking about Ill leave you the following from the FTCgtUnless your engine is knocking buying higher octane gasoline is a waste of money. Premium gas costs  to  cents per gallon more than regular. That can add up to  or more a year in extra costs. Studies indicate that altogether drivers may be spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year for higher octane gas than they need.gtIt may seem like buying higher octane premium gas is like giving your car a treat or boosting its performance. But take note the recommended gasoline for most cars is regular octane. In fact in most cases using a higher octane gasoline than your owners manual recommends offers absolutely no benefit. It wont make your car perform better go faster get better mileage or run cleaner. Your best bet listen to your owners manual.I added the emphasis to for most cars. ,LifeProTips,chs9dlu,1,t5_2s5oq

If there is a time constraint like say before  Id state that in the subject as well.Its all about good communication with your coworkers. Send only things that either they need to know have requested to be kept in the loop on or are needing to act upon. Label appropriately to minimize their clutter.I really dislike situations where you are  responsible for everything thats in your inbox. Sometimes doing actual work means that you are not sitting there reading everything as it come in. As such if I am sending something that needs to be seen soon I will contact the person to let them know Ive sent such a thing. If not I dont expect them to find it until some time later. And even then I expect them to not have time to read everything fully.On the other end of proper communication is the organization that has evolved CC to mean Cover Can.

Youll be surprised at how much more you drink since it is easily available.If possible try to fill from a water cooler or other filtered source.  While some people my self included dont mind the taste of the chemically flavored tap water others cant stand it my wife falls in that category.  Using fresh filtered water does have a much better taste well lack of taste? and I find I drink more filtered than tap even when the flavor is near unnoticeable to me.Also if you dislike the taste of plain water get a thing of lemon or lime juice like  at most supermarkets the ones that are shaped like a lemon and bright yellow and add a small squeeze of that in there.

If the title The Greatest Scam in Medical History and the compasion with Galileos plight dont sound any alarms for you or if you feel the need to link to a site promoting the Keto diet you might need to frequent more credible sources. The cholesterol scam is nothing of the sort. There has always been debate about the finer aspects of it and lately a study brought into question the ratios that are healthy or unhealthy and the numbers in a calculator used to determine if people needed a specific drug. There is nothing in serious literature that says that saturated fats are not related to heart disease. In fact it very much still is the controversy is about the levels not the concept. Here is the NYT saying that the problem is that risk is overestimated not that there is no risk The scientists would be very silly indeed if they based all their assumptions in a single experiment made decades ago. Thats not how science works though. The scam is nothing more than another conspiracy theory. Extraordinary claims requiere extraordinary evidence indeed and ketodietapp.coms blog seems not to be on par with the task.EDIT AuthorityNutrition.com is made by a medical student.

1297193,0,t3_28xi95,I feel a little bit bad for sharing because I am in direct contradiction to the most upvoted post. But maybe OP or others will benefit from my a different point of view. I dont really like the idea of setting a ticking clock on meditation it seems to be opposite of what one wants to achieve. To me it makes meditation into this task that you do for x minutes...like a  minute workout sham thing. I meditated for as long as I do and accept it. This has taught me that I dont need a  minute session to achieve benefits from meditation. I also choose no focal aids other than my breath. Your breath is with you everywhere you go no one needs to ring your breath you dont need to hear it as it is a physically erupting process and you dont need to remind yourself to breathit is an excellent focal point. Speaking of breath I dont do any deep or special breathing I just breath normally and focus on my breath at the tip of my nose. But one can feel their breathing throughout the entire body so where one chooses to focus doesnt really matter. Body position. This one is quite frustrating for me. We are always told sit up straight spine erect blah blah blah. What if you cant sit up straight? What if you cant sit up at all? One shouldnt meditate? Ridiculous. You can meditate sitting standing or lying in a hospital bed. Now i dont want to throw environment and body position out the window entirely as there are side benefits to good practicing good posture but dont come to a point where you NEED to be in a specific position or environment. Dealing with thoughts as labeled thingspuppies traffic strangers etc. I hear a lot of people talk about this. For me personally it causes recursive thought surrounding the label. Maybe that doesnt happen for others but it happens with me and can be intrusive. I simple notice my thoughts giving none of them any special attention attention is for the breath. Thoughts will come and go naturally much like breath.  So my advice in sorta tldr formdont worry about how long you meditate but DO meditate until you are refreshed. This CAN happen quickly. audible aids are ok but might build dependency on something outside of your body. Try meditation focusing on breath alone. let your thoughts just be in the same way you let your breath just be. Take care not to cause a recursive thought loop that might hinder youmediate when you want to and where you want to even inside a moment where you dont have the opportunity to sit up straight or obey this or that ritual. ,LifeProTips,cifjuk5,113,t5_2s5oq

1307379,0,t1_cigop1h,no Im not at all confused. There are two types of fruits. Some ripen well off the tree some do not.  Uihatesarrahpalin is talking about the fact that apples ripen fully off the tree as well as they do on the tree. Im aware of that so is forlarren. If you go and read back through the whole conversation Forlarrens whole point is that there is a big difference in taste between a pineapple picked early and a pineapple allowed to ripen on the tree. He is contrasting this to an apple which he says barely tastes any different picked early or when ripe. He is not disagreeing with uihatesarahpalin. He is also emphasizing that apples fall in the class of fruit that ripen just fine off of the tree. He is stating that the taste is only slightly better when picked off the tree simply because its fresh. All uihatesasarahpalin is talking about is the underlying chemical reactions. An apple will ripen just fine off a tree a pineapple will not. Forlarren was making the same point in a different way an apple that is ripened of the tree will still taste pretty good a  pineapple ripened off the tree will not taste very good.  You and uihatesarahpalin both took him saying that an apple is only slightly better on a tree than off it to mean that he is saying an apple doesnt ripen well off the tree. He was making the exact opposite point. An apple ripened on and off the tree is close the same while I pineapple is not.  Slightly better ! same like you said but despite the fact that the chemical process of ripening remains the same off and on a tree its not surprising a freshly picked fruit would at least taste marginally better than one that had been sitting around for a while ripening off the tree. That isnt saying that the ripening process is different.Farlarren is saying that apples can ripen off the tree while pineapples cannot.  Uihatesarahpalin then says FALSE apples can ripen off the tree just fine.  Its becuase he misinterpreted the point of farlerrens message which is basically that an apple allowed to ripen off the tree tastes about the same as one allowed to ripen on the tree as opposed to other fruits which dont ripen well off the tree.,LifeProTips,cigp39y,1,t5_2s5oq

1329218,0,t3_29axbf,Ive gone to only one all inclusive and Im planning on going to another next summer. They truly are amazing. The first was in Mexico cant remember the name at all but it was a disaster. My stepmother planned it and relied solely on the website pictures and some reviews on the website itself. I being the researcher that I am looked up this place and found hundreds of terrible reviews of this place. Needless to say I was worried. We got there and left the very next morning. Sounds a little over the top but they were incredibly disappointed. We got our money back and did some quick research to relocate to a much nicer place that had solid review up and down the internets. My advice after this long winded story is to check reviews from every damn place possible. Travleocity Kayak any place like that. I feel like its important to read even the bad reviews. Some will be crazy bullshit from very unhappy people but if you start to notice one problem appear over and over its probably a real thing. Once you find a good one try Googling it to look at other possible reviews on random forums or blogs. I always try to be as thorough as possible.I hope this helped!Oh and if youre thinking about going to Mexico we stayed in the Gran Caribe Real. Not too shabby.

This phone did the same thing so I kept a log of every lockup battery pull and reboot.  weeks later I emailed VM back attaching the log. A CS agent called me  minutes later and offered to upgrade me to the Motorola Triumph the best phone they had at the time and give me two free months of service for all the trouble Id been having. And as I mentioned elsewhere in this thread I had a problem activating an airtime card with Tracfone and they have me some free minutes for my trouble.

1365522,0,t3_29o8yx,Well I dont know what kind of position of authority youre dealing with but I work with  talkers all slightly different.Talker  is an older guy who always has a relevant story about a place he worked a friend he has a vacation he was on etc etc. No matter what the topic he can weigh in with personal experience at length.Talker  is the manager of the location. Nice enough but everything relates back to her kids and every story requires a prestory so I can understand the significance of the story itself.Talker  is the assistant manager and actually a close personal friend and he talks about things I really enjoy talking about but he does it at inopportune moments. IE a customer will come in and he wont stop talking until the last moment or Im trying to go to lunch or the bathroom and he calls for my attention at the doorway.Anyway my main method is to start doing work an actual job of that needs doing around the store. Restocking this checking for orders that may have come in basically something that subconsciously signals to them that Im busy. People like interaction in their conversations and when you stop giving them as much their talking can dwindle. And if its a boss or a higher up at work they cant get mad at you for working. Even preface it with you can keep going but I have to finish this.But sometimes there isnt anything to do and no customers coming in and they launch into a big huge talking point and you feel really trapped. Two things that Ive used successfullyInterrupt apologize for it and announce you have to use the bathroom be clear that its urgent. If you can cut their narrative a lot of the time when you come back out theyll ask you where they were. Sorry I cant remember gets you out of it. If they do remember their momentum may be gone and you can capitalize and turn the conversation your way.And then theres my trump card. I use it sparingly because itd be obvious if I did it every time I think you may have told me this one a while ago but I might be thinking of another story what were key points again? Or even better if they have told you the story you can recount it in point form. If you have actually heard it problem solved. If you havent heard it getting them to cover the big salient points by themselves takes their joy. Now theyve given away the story in a short time and repeating it in long form seems pointless.Sidebar If you get stuck in these convos because you start a conversation and then they start dominating it interrupt at every possible second and say we can get back to what youre talking about in a sec but I was trying to sayasktelll you blank.,LifeProTips,cinghce,3,t5_2s5oq

1379445,0,t1_cip6j2t,So for France Id say yes and no. Frequently a region will be famous for a particular type of wine they produce sometimes the only type and so that will get a little inflated. Ive found you pay about double for the the name.Take Champagne for instance. Ive never found a bottle for under . However Cremant is the name for sparkling white wines from other regions of France besides Champagne and can be just as good for half the price. I particularly like Cremant dJura or Cremant dAlsace.Chablis is famous for minerally stony unoaked chardonnays. These likewise run about  but my current favorite white is from a mile outside the Chablis AOC on the same limestone beds. Since its not from Chablis it cant be called Chablis. Its called Chitry and I usually find it for between .Plus there are other regions and styles that arent as famous but frequently a fabulous bargain depending on your taste. Provence Roses and Bandols arent well known but some of my favorites. Rhone blends are fabulous table wines and usually retail between the upper tens and teens. Not to mention there are plenty of places outside of France that are quite inflated as well. Napa and Sonoma come to mind as places inside the US where you pay at least a little for the name. Washington State Columbia Valley or Horse Heaven Hills might be a better bargain in those cases.,LifeProTips,cip75h4,0,t5_2s5oq

Worn teeth need restorations.  Restorations need to be serviced on occasion for the life of the tooth.  Just brush with a soft bristle brush and a plain old toothpaste.  Floss often.  Mouthwash is great.  If you have items in your diet that stain your teeth you will get stained teeth.  If you want brighter more naturallyappearing teeth remove staining items from your diet.  Dont use peroxide.  Dont brush with baking soda.  Dont do oil pulling.  Dont use a hard or medium bristle brush.  I could go on.  But for now Im just adding activated charcoal to my list of donts.

1533321,0,t3_2brys4,Ok  Female driver here. So Ill share some girly tips for longdriving. Once you start getting out west restrooms are a tricky subject.  Some remote locations dont take kindly to people using their rooms without being a customer and if you have a microbladder that can be frustrating. Consider the GoGirl.  Ive always had one in the car and Ive only ever had to use it once. But I was SO glad I did have it.  Wear pantyliner. Easiest way to freshen up after sitting in the car for  hours.  Toss the bra.  Keep it simple sports bra or something equivalent. Or nothing.  Very soft shoes  nearly ballet slipper soft. Or shoes that breath. I dont like driving with thick soled sandals. They tend to be problematic with food pedals that are close together Suntan lotion for your soontobedrivers tan left arm! Leave early stop often.  Get up at  have your free breakfast and be on the road by . Avoid rush hours in densely populated regions. If you must get up at  hit the road stop around a and have a relaxing breakfast get back on the road by a.  Do the same for early dinner. As others have mentioned catch catnaps and restroom breaks by major shopping centersmallsWalmarts. As for listening to books  music  comedy  TEST THIS.  For my personal tastes listening to upbeat music and singing along is by far better than listening to books. Listening to someone talk will absolutely put me to sleep. Its nearly hypnotic. So you need to find out. You dont want to discover that the audiobook makes you sleepy while youre on a dark narrow street.  Even if you stop and just jog around the car  schedule it regularly. You want to keep your heart rate up especially after dusk.  MOVING your body is the best wakeup ever.   Unless you are on a serious deadline there are thousands of little things you can do see and explore on the road.  I remember the first time I saw the Corn Palace in SD.  Never knew it existed.  It was the wildest most surreal pit stop we had on our trek to Yellowstone.  Dont be afraid to get off the highway! Lastly you are going to be on East Coast time while you are traveling out west.  Youll find yourself waking up at am naturally... so dont play to enjoy the free breakfast.  Grab a coffee and a togo muffin if they allow you to do early hit the road and sit down for a relaxing breakfast later.  Youll also crash earlier so plan accordingly.Other thoughts Keep a journal.  A brief note of where you are what you are seeing odd things you are finding. Buy a magnet from every tourist trap you visit and every state you pass through.   If you can map your trip on something like Google Maps and search for hotels outside of major cities. Also try to look for interesting pit stops along the way.   Do you have time to schedule a day where you arent driving? Id suggest you find a place you two would enjoy and have a fun day!Enjoy the drive!,LifeProTips,cj8h7z0,18,t5_2s5oq

1602770,0,t1_cjgxsor,Always keep the electric toothbrush charged to full as the rotation speed decreases as the battery charges down.With an electric toothbrush just move extremely slowly through all the teeth.Many years back I made the mistake of treating it like a normal toothbrush and I went back and forth and I used way more force than necessary.As a result the gums receded a bit.As a result I started noticing some pain even though I never get cavities and I found out that the gums receded a bit.When I told my hygienist that the precision head was fraying after one month she started laughing.She said that she has had her head for five months.My dentist said his toothbrush head never frays and only changes it for the bacteria.After going back to keeping the toothbrush on full power Ive been able to use the same head for  months.When the bristles rotate at full speed they repel off your teeth more.I think this keeps the bristles from bending and fraying more.The fast fraying was obviously connected to the gums.When I first used an electric toothbrush I used the precision head.I remember it lasting a little over a month.I then switched to the floss action head which seemed harder.It would last three months until it was badly frayed.Im pretty sure the reason for fraying had to do with how I would never put the toothbrush back on the charger which isnt in the bathroom.I would charge it when it dies out.I guess that as it slowed down I was pressing down harder and doing a normaltoothbrush motion to compensate.However if its fraying even when you always use it at full power then you must be pressing down pretty hard.My dentist said that if you hear a sound change when the toothbrush presses against the teeth youre pressing too hard.But as I mentioned at full power and rotation speed it bounces off your teeth and its hard to press down on the teeth.Im actually about to change my precision head and Ive had it for five months.When I compare it to a newer head the spread looks almost identical.The one I have now only lost some of its blue coloring at the tip but thats it.I used to brush for  to  seconds and use the stiffer floss action head and it would fray after a few months.Now I use the electric toothbrush for the full two minutes until the vibrate notification and use a softer precision head and theres no fraying at all.,LifeProTips,cjh7541,10,t5_2s5oq

I run the CM nightlies on my DNA and TFT and the only issues Ive ever had were when the devices were newly supported. Not saying you wont have issues but you shouldnt.Sorry I like rambling. TLDR Harder than it should be thanks to Verizon but not impossible if the exploits still work. Read through the guides thoroughly. After the deed is done experiment with different roms and enjoy!,LifeProTips,cjxz724,1,t5_2s5oq

1752514,0,t1_cjzvk81,I highly recommend the book Getting Things DoneThe author talks a lot about efficiently using whatever system of organization you use. Some things from the book off the top of my head Your system should be easy to use so that it doesnt interfere with you actually getting things done. A lot of people will have overly complex systems that require a lot of time to manage and organize. You shouldnt be spending  minutes just organizing your todolist or checking it every  minutes.Another pitfall is just making a giant list of projects you need to do which is what most people do. You need to actually decide what is the next bitesized chunk that can be completed for a project  task and write it down. For example putting Learn to Code Websites sounds like and is a monumental task. It will sit on your list forever since your brain doesnt want to figure out what Learn to Code means and you will never feel like you are making progress on that task. Instead you should recognize that as one of your more long term goals and the next task to further that goal might be find a resource online to start learning code from. Maybe you take  minutes doing research and find a site you like bam you check that shit off of your list and youve actually made a step toward your goal. Then later on or the next day when you are organizing your list for the day you might make the next task for that goal as read  instructional article.Another tip is to write down literally everything you want to accomplish whether it be long term or that you need to take out the trash on a huge list this is not a daily todolist like above. You arent going to use this list to keep organized and help you accomplish things but to just get all that shit out of your head. The more things you have floating in your head that you feel you need to remember the more stressed out and overwhelmed you feel. Writing your goals and ideas on a everything I ever want to do type of list that you can easily access from time to time will free up a lot of mental energy.One of my favorite things about the book is that one of its main tenants is spending time with friends and family Always always always make time to spend with loved ones even if you are busy because what is the point of getting anything done if you arent living life?,LifeProTips,ck029bq,3,t5_2s5oq

On what basis are these tests formed beyond the authors feeling of what he thinks is right and wrong? A belief can be logical even if no one believes it because logic and truth are not the same thing. Secondly the outsider test is verifiably shown to be false every time a nonbelieving adult comes to faith. All it would take is once but its a fairly regular occurrence.As for the insider test someone can stop believing for any reason. That they stop believing in itself says nothing about the validity of the belief itself. In a word neither test actually does anything like give a critical explanation of the logical inconsistencies it claims exist.Im not interested in debating the truth of religion and I dont care if you think Christianity is wrong.

Then you have to explain you dont have one and the internet or the girl behind the counter at the grocery store where you bought the previous pair cant help you.CL fitting in the Netherlands requires no certification or education. Anybody is free to fit lenses regardless of training or skill. To get certification is a minimum of  years or  if you do optometry but in NL you wont spend much time fitting lenses as an optometrist and all this work is ruined by the internet and big chain optical stores.Now to be clear im not some anticapitalist or jealous hater. If folks can save money on what is essentially a overthecounter product i can appreciate that. But a lot of the money earned in the CL business by third parties is over the back of CL fitters. Internet sells the product half price so CL fitters are selling less and less lenses while big chain optical stores are giving away prescriptions for free. So certified CL fitters have a hard time charging for their time and work.Its a proffession that has lost its shine a long time ago here and even though the national CL fitters organization tries to get certification mandatory the grocery store lens is just too ubiqitous now for things to turn around.,LifeProTips,ck6fm6y,1,t5_2s5oq

1819307,0,t1_ck7twjf,Just to clarify the bean itself does lose a little bit of caffeine during roasting but it is in such a small amount compared to all the other factors listed that it effectively is meaningless.To expand a little on just the roast roasting will also lose water and sugar content and expand the bean.  So you get a larger lighter weight bean with slightly less lt caffeine.  But you dont eat the bean so when you brew a dark roast you may use more beans than when you brew a light roast brew by weight and ultimately this will leave you with more caffeine per cup in the dark roast than the light roast.,LifeProTips,ck8etri,1,t5_2s5oq

But the CATE might be just in the sweet spot as to be quite efficient and cheap so if you dont have a gigabit ethernet network now but plans to upgrade it may be a good choice.Both CAT and CATE run at Mhz and CATE allows you to use gigabit ethernet. They basically uses only two pairs of wire even though they have four so theres not much need for insulation agains interferences and stuff.CAT is da bomb. It allows you to run it at MHz and uses all the four pairs of wires but they are a bit bulky because of the insulation.

Mate no matter what you day I guarantee you I can come up with a way a pick pocket would do it.Keep your wallet in your pocket attached to a string connected to your beltrings alerting the PP that you have valuables in that pocket making you a target!End of the day you can say anything but its about being as careful as you possibly can fact is no matter what you do theres a chance of being beaten unless you just dont bring anything with you and even then you run the risk of your house being broken into and hey all your valuables are there! ,LifeProTips,ckjhvtv,28,t5_2s5oq

The only exception to his is my Instrumental station which is so big it might suggest something new that I like and Ill never hear it again until  weeks later because it has s of songs in its rotation being my first one I created and constantly adding to.So I might agree that Pandora may not extremely deep depth within each genre in distributes though its been deep enough for me for now it does have pretty incredible breadth in the different kinds of sounds the site can offer. You might notice I didnt list any metal stations because I didnt make any yet and theres a whole world of comedians that I havent explored yet either.All of this from  site and for  bucks a year I get no ads and highquality audio.

In computer science an example would be an attacker that sets up a rogue access point for a corporate network. A user logs in by proving that they know the password. The attacker actually wants to access a file share on the internal network using the same authentication method. If theres no channel binding information the attacker can act as a man in the middle and relay the users WiFi authentication to the fileserver and successfully log in.With channel binding the fileserver will reject the authentication data since it is marked for use on WiFi only.,LifeProTips,cl15vhr,3,t5_2s5oq

Holy shit have you ever seen that before? Look at their clothing and pick something that I can relate to. So you like watches. Did you ever go to x? That bracelet looks like something from there. Ask about hobbies but not like what are your hobbies? More like when youre not busting ass at work what do you do to relax? Ask where theyre from. Pretty standard question but it goes a long way and can be an instant rapport builder. Where are you from? Shit youre from x? Me too! What blockstreetetc...

2198002,0,t3_2k6w5o,I hear a lot of my fellow coworkers say stuff like first shift doesnt do it so why should we? yet everything Ive heard about what they say is that the other shifts dont work as hard as they do. It seems like every shift acts like this and it starts to become this festering ball of laziness.A lot of the time if you were to try to point out an issue that they had done then theyll resent you for that and then go out of their way to be big crybabies about every little thing that you do.Theres only one right way to address this so I make a point to do my work as best I can so that I can try to break this cycle. ,LifeProTips,clj7y23,1,t5_2s5oq

2217453,0,t1_cll81a7,Thats why I put in that part about if you left on good terms.  If you leave on good terms there is no reason to lie.  The old employer will have your back you just didnt fit in that work environment.You dont want to just straight out say I was fired because of... but you should never try to lie your way through life.  People get caught in a web of lies and stories that dont quite add up all the time.If you and the old boss got along and you know you were a good employee there is no harm listing an old employer.  Contacting them and asking permission to add them to the job application is done to be polite more than anything.  This polite nod will work in your favor in the future as well.  There is a reason the application uses May we contact... not How can we contact... Not all previous supervisors want to be bothered even if the past employee was their best friend.Obviously if it was a bad parting you probably dont want to add them.  However lying cheating and stealing your way through an application is a huge way to ruin a potential carrier.  If you were fired for a medical reason dont try and hide it.  You will get caught very quickly. ,LifeProTips,cllowhy,1,t5_2s5oq

A lot of people who graduated and moved away have moved back to be closer to family. We are a tourist town with somewhat low wages and not a lot of decent childcare options so many of us are somewhat forced home. This is my hypothesis for why almost everyone here is selling something through MLM. It is annoying. I have some friends who do it and who will talk to me about other things. But there are people who never previously talked to me who will try to cozy up to me to get me to buy in.  A former classmate tried to pitch to me at my sons birthday party. The part I hate most is how people throw it into normal conversation as if they are just truly bringing up a helpful tip. This girl took the cake so to speak. I definitely looked tired as Id been up all night preparing and well I have two toddlers.

2312480,0,t1_clxhgzi,gt The best gun safety tip with children is dont own guns period.So are you saying that the best course of action when you learn you will become a parent is to sell gift or donate any firearms that you own?  Give up any hobbies regarding said firearms?  That seems a little extreme.I believe that it is possible to sufficiently secure firearms in the home.  Also telling your children exactly where said firearms are will significantly reduce their change of stumbling upon them.  And being willing to teach them and make activities involving firearms available to them will mitigate the need to satisfy curiosity outside of adult supervision.As for children being less mature than adults regarding gun safety Ive since met several adults some are friends that I wouldnt leave alone with a gun. Some people just dont think before they act.  Or are incapable of internalizing a lesson until theyve experienced the consequences themselves.  All you can do is identify those traits early. And avoid exposing them to the opportunity to do something stupid.,LifeProTips,clxjdh5,1,t5_2s5oq

And like you said perhaps the mechanism was relaxation which would likely be caused  at least in my case  by thinking hard about doing the last thing youd want to do if you had a case of the hiccups i.e. asking for more hiccups.Its just like trying hard to fall asleep but failing or trying to stay awake but failing.  Biologically I dont know how to explain the mechanisms of those phenomena but certainly the mind has a role to play in the physiological effects.Id say that in the same way that many people who try to stay awake find it even easier to fall asleep trying to force yourself to hiccup may actually stop you from hiccuping.  You can call me dumb either way but I just know  albeit anecdotally through myself and and about  dozen other people throughout the last neartwo decades  that it has worked.Its a tip.  It costs nothing and you lose nothing by trying it.  The next time you have the hiccups do me a favor and try it.,LifeProTips,cmbjivb,0,t5_2s5oq

And where roughly are you in which town?Oooooh thats a symptom of multiple possibilities.  Right off the bat I could say your phone is most likely the issue and not the provider but thats just playing odds.Assuming your phone is up to date with the latest firmwareoperating system and its not a phone model with a known cell mode issue you might be on the edge of two competing towers or your g signal strength is too low but not quite slow enough to fully change lets say if you cant pull over  of what G is capable of in your area your phone might want to drop G and go to G but then you spike in signal strength for a millisecond and the timeouts reset... etc etcSo from knowing nothing about your specsservice try forcing g only for a while and see if you even need g.

Do these two things to take good pictures every time. Push your chin and jawline away from your neck toward the camera. This will emphasize and define your jawline getting rid of any double chin. See Peter Hurleys Its all about the jaw! . Squinch your eyes just slightly. This is a technique where you BARELY tighten the muscles under your eyes same muscles you use to squint. This will give you a really good looking gaze in the photo and help whatever smile you give to look more genuine. See Peter Hurleys Its all about the Squinch! ,LifeProTips,cmntsh1,1,t5_2s5oq

2541113,0,t3_2orvi9,I think better advice would be. Identify what you are passionate about. Everyone has passions but not everyone knows that they are yet. Discovering your passions in life is the greatest service you could do for your own sense of happiness and success.. Do some research into the careers related to your passions. What do people with the same passions as you do for a living?. See what qualifications are needed for the careers you identified. Chances are that college is probably part of the qualifications but not always. Not everyone needs to go to college to have a successful career!. Always have a backup plan. Always. Things dont always work out and you should be prepared for it. So that passion in playing football didnt translate into a career with the NFL?

The only time it didnt work is when my comp professor caught on being that he was such a damn Orwell fan. But anyways I found that simplistic words are a lot more powerful as Orwell suggests. The problem though is that the strategy to use those simplistic words more powerfully require lots of energy and work to develop just because you have to be able to develop an abstract navigation of your subject through your words alone.

This is true ANY type of project including freelance work for friends ooooh can you make me one of those? and nontraditional forms of payment like how much gas you will buy when carpooling.For you specifically you can certainly ask and try to build an argument around the fact that youre currently working on stuff above and beyond what was specified by your original contract. But for a onemonth internship I dont see that gamble working well  you will probably get told no and your boss will probably think youre a bit dumb for not understanding your contract in the first place.

Anything smaller and youre just being a dick unless youre in some asian metropolis with extremely narrow roads that have like pillars on either side of the lanes that go through intersections. Because seriously Ive lived in several cities in CA Vegas been to New York and several states underneath it... Nowhere in America does any vehicle besides an  wheeler need to do a button hook turn.Except maybe limos. Ok limos and  wheelers. But your god damn uhauls trucks and suvs arent more than like a few feet longer than an Asian sedan so all the rest of these cars need to get into the damn bike lane where there is basically a whole other lane to get the fuck out of my way and then slow down to make the turn.For the noobidiotic drivers that dont deserve their licensesGet into the bike lanebus lane when your turn is coming up THEN slow down THEN make only a right turn. No swerving to the left. If youre making a left turn do the same fucking thing get into the farthest left part of the lane til youre kissing the curb then just make that left.Its not rocket science people. Do that first before deciding you need to make a button hook turn.

2692571,0,t1_cna0bbu,The difference is just in the term of the investment. The same reason a year mortgage currently has a lower rate than a year is that the market expectation is that in the future rates will rise.If you are paying less than  on a year mortgage you have literally gotten the deal of the last halfcentury.The same extra mortgage payment left in a savings account brokerage or retirement account is entirely liquid and you can invest it in whatever you want  could be fixedlength securities like a CD or TBill or a savings account or mutual fund that changes daily.If we ever go back to  inflation will be at  but overnight interest rates will be at . So even every average Joes savings account will be earning more than .At the end of the day these investment decisions become personal. Are you planning to live in your house for  years or ? If its  then that  implicit return from paying mortgage debt early looks pretty good. But if its  then you might sock it away someplace else.

2715541,0,t3_2r0ep9,I struggle with this exact same issue. My problem is a collection of noise generalized anxiety disorder GERD and iron deficiency. I was recently diagnosed for generalized anxiety disorder which effects the way I sleep I have vivid hyperrealistic dreams and my mind thinking its in danger wake up just a tiny bit during dreams thus causing me to get less restful sleep. The only way to fix this would be to undergo the process of finding the correct drug combination as I already exercise regularly eat well have a healthy sex life and have an establish bedtime routine. I also live in NYC and since I am a light sleeper see above noises intrude on my sleep. Earplugs are a wonderful tool.Things my doctor and I talked about when we were trying to solve this issue snoring sleep apnea lights in the bedroom vitamin deficiencies indigestion I have GERD which can effect how I sleep if I eat too soon before bed chemical misfirings like anxiety disorders... I found that taking an iron tablet right before bed helps but I am slightly anemic I had a blood test and the iron was prescribed for a doctor.My recommendation. Make sure you eat no less than  hours before bed. Keep well hydrated during the day and get at least  min of intense exercise or . hours of relaxed exercise a day. Drink a glass of water right as you wake up I keep a water bottle by my bed with ice I put in it the night before which helps a lot.. If that isnt helping get a comprehensive blood panel done by your doctor. Just to make sure there isnt anything going on medically.. Earplugs and a white noise machine might help. Make sure your bedroom is pitch black and has nothing that flashes or moves in the middle of the night in it.. A sleep study. Theyre expensive see if your health insurance will help with some of the costs.Good luck!!,LifeProTips,cncqvje,1,t5_2s5oq

Its great for really cutting through all of the myths and fads out there. Plus its more about lifestyle than dieting. Losing weight in theory is easy the calories you burn metabolism activity must be less than what you put in your body. They say that most everyones metabolism is about the same and food calories are generally the same but nutrition levels are not. They really recommend lifting weights because your metabolism only really increases through exercise when your body repairs muscles. The most effective way to do that is through lifting weights.

Processed through the last  years of history Newark is a special kind of bad that way. So lots of concrete and really bad design choices were made. The design could be easily reworked to make things pretty cool  all the main architecture is there. But its Newark  one of the amazing spots of naked capitalism where everyone is supposed to either float  inches above the ground on the merits of their own genius or die trying.Ive been stuck in Newark a few times so there are no real facilities beyond the bare necessities. Electrical plugs are scarce creature comforts that do exist save the rare bathroom are only in the locked terminals food accommodations are intentionally nonexistent after certain times and security when its present at all is that brofascist weve become accustomed to after  all again mostly because they wouldnt want the local community to take advantage of any unnecessary services or walk off with the amenities.My recommendation is try to get to the very close Marriott at least this week it is which is actually in the Airport complex but which youd have to go outside and walk to it would be actually not at all bad if there was a walkway to the hotel concierge area or they built a purposebuilt rest area away from the airport.,LifeProTips,co2hmpq,2,t5_2s5oq

Lately on her tumblr  I occasionally stalk it from time to time she will post things that would be very difficult to not interpret other than her still having feelings for me. Unfortunately weve been broken up for a year feb th. So it seems pretty delusional to think anything would change.She ended it over text and just blocked my number out of rage. At some point she said what you dont think this is real?! Referring to the breakup to which I responded no! I feel as though I dared her into continuing this while never really attempting to win her back something  she said I would have to do. I admittedly was not showing much affection appreciation towards her at the end meanwhile she was picking up all of the slack.She had just gotten a tattoo of a tree on her ring finger a few months before my name is forest it was to represent me and I feel like she was not feeling loved enough and made herself very vulnerable with the tattoo.Well this wasnt short I suppose but there is still a lot more to be said.Hey thanks for giving me a place to even type this out at sorry if its terribly formatted or just plain doesnt make sense.

Do.I was a junior in EE back in . I have massive procrastination issues but I was happy. I started doing badly in my classes which led me to start skipping classes. I ended up failing all my classes two semesters in a row. Then I dropped out of college. I then spent five fucking years five years working shitty retail jobs unemployed then back to shitty retail jobs. Barely had a working car. Some days I wouldnt even be able to afford food. Some months I wouldnt be able to afford rent and had to ask my family for help then disappear on them for another year because I was too depressed and ashamed to talk to anyone. Lost most of my friends. My family doesnt trust me anymore I dont blame them they tried to help me over and over and over and over and over again.I started taking classes to complete my major last year. Starting out slow and even still Im having some procrastination issues not as bad as before but I am having a difficult time getting out of my bad habits.I am constantly anxious depressed scared frustrated.

Depending on how professional the email is supposed to be Chz is often fine too. But if you call me Mrs. Plz Im not gonna be happy about it.,LifeProTips,copak4z,2,t5_2s5oq

Set goals the night before for the next day and get yourself excited about them. If you have something to look forward too and youre seriously motivated to make some changes in your life nothing will stop you. The most important thing Ive learned that pairs with all of the above is make sure youre disciplined about going to sleep at the right time. You NEED at least  hours of sleep. Shoot for  if you can. And go to sleep at the time you need too to allow for this. Hold yourself too it and youll find it easier and easier to get up and be disciplined. Also dont set more than one alarm. Thats like having a safety net. Set your alarm for one time and commit to getting up as soon as it goes off.

It seems that part of the problem with earworm songs is that you get a fragment of it stuck in your head and your mind has some sort of need to complete which it cant do because it really isnt a song you are fond of  and thus you dont know all of it  Once its completed and you perform the song your mind will let go of it,LifeProTips,cozysa8,3,t5_2s5oq

Too much powder or trap blocked and it doesnt empty of water between rinses until the last stronger spin.As somebody else said cotton should get softer.The other problem is if your dryer is too hot it partly burns the cotton. That will make it crispy. If so check your lint trap. Always clean lint off every time you use the dryer. The efficiency is so much higher and its quicker to dry and it doesnt get over hot.,LifeProTips,cp042f3,143,t5_2s5oq

Although some people in this thread are asserting otherwise the FDA the USDA say it is safe to put hot food directly into the refrigerator and this government food safety site says that letting food cool before putting it in the refrigerator is a big food safety Mistake.   However the best practice is to put food into small shallow containers rather than one big one and separate them in the refrigerator in order to cool it quickly IN the refrigerator. ,LifeProTips,cp05xd8,7,t5_2s5oq

Though I didnt appreciate the person before me doubting that I dont put my money with my mouth is preaching a healthy breakfast but not actually doing it and that if someone did want a healthy breakfast theyd need a servant in order to do so. So I rebutted with what I eat every morning and mentioned it takes minutes and you can make it while doing other morning tasks. It was a pretty straight forward response I thought. If anything that was more of a LPT than the OPs post.  And no if all I ate all day was what I ate for breakfast than of course its not enough. But that wasnt the point. Its was merely saying that is a nutritious option in the morning. And really its up for debate if you should even eat a combination of proteins with fruits OR vegetables with grains because your body has a more difficult time digesting all those variables. Its better to eat fats with fats and fruits with fruits grains with grains proteins with proteins. But I digress. Again this post isnt about healthy breakfasts its about a LPT on how to wake up easier in the AM.And despite whatever was was mentioned this is really all anyone should take from my commentsgtWaking up and immediately giving your body a pill to digest is not good advice from where Im coming from. And many people feel nauseous taking pills on an empty stomach.gtHaving a banana or an apple on your nightstand not only slowly wakes you up in the sense of physically doing something peeling a banana or chewing on an apple it rewards your body with a nutritious snack thats easy to digest. And thats important because while in restmode your digestive system slows down. Eating something soft and healthy is better than a calcified rock sitting in your gut for a half hour.Sidenote Egg yolks help produce HDL not LDL And HDL is naturally created my the liver so if you eat egg yolks everyday then your liver doesnt have to work as hard.

3426626,0,t3_2zgql5,In terms of preventing sweat from occurring try dressing in layers.  Once you warm up maybe you can shed one to help regulate temperature.  Depending on what kind of bag you use you can find a cyclingspecific bag which doesnt sit flat on the back like many backpacks which can cause you to sweat by reducing air flow and thus raising temperature and not allowing sweat to evaporate.I would also suggest looking into wool clothing or something else that wicks sweat and dries quickly.  I prefer wool as it doesnt smell and is good in both cold and warm weather.  You can also pack a bottle of cold water and drink it when you get in to work which will help cool you down.  ,LifeProTips,cpiuzx0,0,t5_2s5oq

Youre just really not doing yourself any favors by applying for jobs outside of your current experience level its just going to be another application you file and never heard anything back from its frustrating Ive been there.  Im also not saying you shouldnt apply for jobs that are a bit of a stretch for your current skill set by all means if its something you think you can do without a huge learning curve go for it.  Your time is just better spent working towards the positions you are a good fit for.  So if you apply to a local company online send your resume and a nice cover letter in the mail to HR as well letting them know you applied and look forward to an opportunity to discuss how you can be an asset to the company.  Also keep in mind in some companies your resume has to get past HR first so if you dont have  relateable experience you may get tossed in the reject pile as the HR generalist may not know how exactly your skills and experience can directly correspond to the job posting the IT hiring manager made.  Focus on job offers that will be relevant to your skills now but in a company that offers some growth and development they do exist as unlikely as that may seem sometimes.

As far as I know you can only find your AGI on your tax return unless you have an accountant or something. Or your payroll puts in on your checks but mine doesnt.Edit  what I described here was the economic hardship deferment which brings the loan current and suspends the payment obligation and interest for one year from the date you went delinquent.

3520837,0,t3_30kkuq,I am  as well. I am not necessarily happy with my height but I have accepted it since there really isnt much we can do about it short of surgery which just isnt worth it. People who are   ...shut up you arent short I would kill to be that tall Being short has its benefits as a person who takes weight lifting pretty seriously have short stature allows me to be stronger than most  I also am somewhat of a gymnast and being short somewhat helps with that as well. However there are obviously cons...since I am so into weight lifting people can see this as sort of a napoleon complex...being able to do flips to my hearts content leaves room for people to refer to me as a little monkey. Nothing really bad but annoying for sure.Anyways its really easy to say If a girl judges you for your height than she obviously isnt a good person well yeah of course she isnt  a good or nice person. However what people dont understand is that there arent that many Good or nice women out there. Are they out there? Of course but being short definitely destroys your odds for women. I have been turned down countless times on my online dating profile most likely due to being short. I personally am not a bad looking guy and I guarantee if I removed my height on my profile or added  I could get way more potential dates. All of the dates that I have been on were with girls shorter than me and to be honest I dont think I could date a taller girl and I dont even bother messaging women who are taller than  unless their profile is really attractive. Obviously height isnt everything there are plenty of short guys with enough game to pickup taller women but all I am trying to say is that being short cuts out potential dates big time. Most girls are short and prefer to date taller guys but being ...most girls who are willing to go on dates with me are under  tall. Sorry if this doesnt help but I really just want to throw that out there for everyone who thinks height doesnt matter...we live in a world where unfortunately it does. Obviously there are women out there but its definitely not going to be an easy search. ,LifeProTips,cptlnkb,3,t5_2s5oq

3536793,0,t1_cpupp3d,Thanks for the wall of text it was an amusing read. Theres only one part that is worth responding too thoughgt Its possible to get away from a tornado via a vehicle Ive done itGood for you. Other people have tried and died horrible gruesome deaths. Its also possible to stand outside and yell at the tornado to turn away from you. But we dont advise people to do that because we advise people to make decisions that minimize their risk of injury or death. The problem with your attitude is summed up in your last sentence in that paragraph If you cant run dont try to but its not a smart thing at all to say its never possible. It definitely is. How do you draw the line when fleeing is safer than staying? How can a typical citizen assimilate all the information necessary to make this decision in the few minutes they have before a tornado hits? The answer is they cant. Which is why the advice we give is very simple Dont flee from a tornado in your car. The only exception is when youre already on the roads and no shelter is immediately available. And that much is so obvious that it doesnt even need to be said. But this is an amusing segue to your final paragraphgt PS I dont think anyone with a brain in their head down south actually listens to any meteorologist. Honestly this throws into doubt every comment youve made claiming expertise and firsthand experience with respect to tornadoes in my mind. People like Gary England and James Span command huge amounts of respect in their respective communities. Sure everyone thinks he or she is an armchair meteorologist as evidenced by this thread. That doesnt actually make them a meteorologist. And the coup de grace is thisgt If theyre gonna try to run theyll try to run but I dont know many idiots that would let a traffic jam really stop them from getting the fuck out of there... Rules are off when theres a tornado.This is EXACTLY the problem. Youre describing a human catastrophe of staggering proportions. Scene A trafficridden highway clogged with motorists fleeing a tornado because they ignored the advice of emergency managers and meteorologists. Thunder and lightning rumble in the distance lumbering forward. As the ominous maelstrom comes into full view tornado sirens begin to wail in the background. Still the traffic doesnt move. Hundreds of motorists watch in terror as the silhouette of halfmile wide tornado peeks through the curtain of a squall just two miles to their west. As the seconds pass the tendril of dark cloud connecting sky to ground becomes wider and wider never veering to the right or left. Motorists begin to panic. They know theyre caught in the path of the beast. Some are able to wiggle their way out and veer off the highway. But a soaking just  minutes prior from another squall makes the field next to the highway impassable for all but a handful of vehicles. As the impending tornado inches closer the panic in the motorists intensifies. Drivers in cars that have been blocked make a final decision they ditch their cars and run into the field looking for a ditch or any other cover. But in this case there isnt any. And their panicked decision has thrown hundreds of other motorists into the same dangerous position as the highway is snared with offangle abandoned vehicles after all rules are off when theres a tornado and its every man for himself. Less than a mile away now the tornado lumbers forward incessantly. Scene.The point of severe weather education is to prevent this situation from happening in the first place. At which point this story comes to life its too late. There isnt anything that can be done to minimize risk of injury or death. Which is why we tell people not to flee from tornadoes in their cars. Or not to jump into water with great white sharks. Or not to run up to a black bear cub. You can successfully deal with these situations with the right amount of knowledge and luck. But theyre far more riskier than if you had just avoided them in the first place.So throw your cynicism and jadedness away and stop giving people advice that could lead to the deaths of hundreds of innocent families. Im sure theyll appreciate your soothing remarks about Darwinism when a family member is vivisected by the hood of hisher car when caught fleeing from a tornado.,LifeProTips,cpvf0u8,1,t5_2s5oq

I am simply stating that instead of doing some near useless crunches and pushups between loading screens get an actual workout routine and stick to it. Not only will you actually gain some muscle but you will also feel more physically and mentally satisfied compared to an hour spent playing video games.

3585084,0,t3_31e399,This LPT is mostly that being nice to people will get them to be nice to you in return.  Im a doctor and while nobody bribes me with candy in the hospital when patients actually try to show their appreciation even with just a thank you it really brightens your day compared to someone who decides to start off by yelling about how their water isnt cold enough and how they cant believe you dont already know their entire medical history and no it wasnt already in their records theyre just completely nuts before youre even able to introduce yourself.Dont get me wrong though Ill provide the same needed care to everyone even if theyre a toolbag but its just human nature that your doctors and nurses and aides are going to check in on you more often and remember about stuff you need more easily if they actually enjoy taking care of you because youre not an asshole and theyll be charmed by the fact that youre maintaining grace despite being sick.  For example if youre not screaming at me Im much more likely to ask if I can bring you anything else to make you more comfortable like an extra blanket or pillow or food from the fridge late at night etc.  If youre really nice I might even buy you something from downstairs to give you a break from the crappy hospital food.  I know a doctor thatll actually bring nonahole patients their preferred beer lol sadly I dont think my position is quite secure enough to pull that off they run their own department so itd be kinda tough to fire them lolI dont even think this LPT is really just for the hospital though if you bring snacks for everyone at work everyday chances are that your coworkers will mysteriously like you better etc.,LifeProTips,cq0xetr,2,t5_2s5oq

3598341,0,t1_cq2ee7a,Amazing story. It seems that you had good memories with her but your absence to study made things go down. Im not blaming you focusing on your future is really good but maybe you can make things better.Hey have you tried to see things from her point of view ? It may help.I bet that she would say that youre distant or even that she doesnt know you anymore from all that time youve been away. The way I see it in a relationship most women want comfort while men want speed or results. By that I mean that the woman wants to be sure that this is what she wants and that shes not going out with a psycho and that the man wants to feel things going forward and seeing results. We can show this in a Venn Diagram I tried to make one but I just realized Im really bad at photoshop Anyway without getting too much technical she seemed to be really comfortable when you were around. You got distant so she began to feel weird. She then isolated herself simply to feel comfortable. Now I know that it may sound hard to say that shes not comfortable when around you but I just mean that shes not used anymore to stick around with someone. So all you have to do is make her comfortable again.If I were to do something I would probably give it sometime then try to call her go out to have a dinner or to talk. Do that often. Show that youre present and there for her. She will notice it. Also if you ever feel down because of how things are going with her dont complain instead smile and show her that even so youre enjoying and try to be happy. That will make both of you better.Eventually she can feel comfortable again and then I bet she would go back to you.Note that this is how I see it and I may be wrong! Go with your feelings and act as you feel you should. Even not doing anything will have a consequence on your relationship with her.Oh! Almost forgot Dont forget to live your life whilst giving some time to her.Again best wishes to you two! Feel free to say something if you want to talk. D,LifeProTips,cq2fqy2,2,t5_2s5oq

Then you change your mindset from complaining to just mildly happy. It also helps if you dont verbally complain like Its too hot! just say instead its very warm out today so you avoid the negativity.I can tell you where I got this from if anyone wants to know.Im also very fairskinned with red hair.

Use the Other Option and simply type in Poor post Quality or something of the sort.  if you give no reason we are inclined to ignore your report. We will weigh this against comments and the upvotes to see how valuable the tip really is. Otherwise if you feel the tip isnt terribly useful but isnt of poor quality simply downvote it. This may include things like Use a cup of ice flipped upsidedown in a freezer to determine if your meat is spoiled. Its a nifty trick that can be used by many to accomplish the goal. But does that mean its the best solution? Do I agree with its methods? If the answers are no downvote and consider posting your own tip or talking kindly with the OP on how to improve the tip.Thank you for your kind words. It means a lot.

European Contact of article  Native American disease and epidemics sfw gtgtThe arrival of Europeans ushered in what is termed the Columbian Exchange During this period European settlers brought many different technologies and lifestyles with them arguably the most harmful effect of this exchange was the arrival and spread of disease. gtNative Americans due to the lack of prior contact with Europeans had not previously been exposed to the diseases that were prevalent on the distant continent. Therefore they had not built up internal immunities to the diseases or formed any medicines to combat them. Europeans came into the New World bearing various diseases. Those infected with diseases either possessed them in a dormant state or were not quarantined in such a way that distanced them enough from Native Americans not to spread the diseases allowing them to spread into epidemics. gtThe diseases brought by Europeans are not easily tracked since there were numerous outbreaks and all were not equally recorded. The most notable disease brought by Europeans was smallpox The Lakota Indians called the disease the running face sickness.  Smallpox was lethal to many Native Americans bringing sweeping epidemics and affecting the same tribes repeatedly. In the summer of  a small pox epidemic struck the Huron natives in the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes regions. The disease had reached the Huron tribes through traders returning from Qubec and remained in the region throughout the winter. When the epidemic was over the Huron population had been reduced to roughly  people about half of what it had been before .  Between  and  at least four different epidemics struck the Plains tribes.  When the plains Indians began to learn of the white mans diseases they intentionally avoided contact with them and their trade goods. But many tribes were enamored with things like metal pots skillets and knives and they traded with the white newcomer anyway inadvertently spreading diseases to their villages. gtInteresting List of epidemics | Modern social statistics of Native Americans | Disease in colonial America | Impact of Native American gaming Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqmzonf oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqmzonf.

Yes I do cook fish in tinfoil capsules on the grill or open tinfoil pans and its in butter and llemon juice and still tastes grilley and its outside instead of in my sink.When I have a grill I preferentially cook on that outside if I can at all get away with it.  The grill is not an escape for me its the main way I cook food and only about  of my grilling is actual grilling techniques.  Beans in an open can corn on the cob direct even eggs on the side burner.  Huge advantages to doing this especially in summer.  As a bachelor being able to cook with zero cooking dishes is another advantage plus speed and convenience where I just cook everything at once.I will have an outside cooking center of which the grillsmoker will only be an accessory.  It will feature a full stoveoven under cover accessible by deck so I can run in an out.  ,LifeProTips,cqooz95,5,t5_2s5oq

When you automatically shower again for example right after waking up then you have a habit and you dont have to willpower yourself into basic hygiene. Whatever you can add to that automated behavior routine is just one more thing you dont have to use up your willpower on.

I want to be out and obvious because the more of us that are out the less other it seems. Were just people like everyone else.    I also think its especially important for bisexuals. Not just because of bierasure which is a post all by itself but because its so much easier for bisexuals to stay in the closet. We can just date the opposite sex and no one knows. Because Im in a relationship with a woman whos also bi if I dont show my pride then Im not being out and helping the cause!    Theres evidence that bisexuals make up the largest majority of LGBT people. But many of us arent out.

4043875,0,t1_crh71iv,Indeed such a system is not encryption. Its just a form of access control. There is nothing you can really do to prevent people from being able to modify files they control to get rid of stuff like that or extract data that is present. If the data is on the users computer then you can retrieve it. Its as simple as going into a disassembler tool like IDA Pro and disabling the part of the program that checks for the password or alternatively modifying the file or writing your own program to read the file format.When you take an encryption class the first thing they usually go over is classical ciphers which deal with letters instead of bits. The most basic encryption algorithm is shift ciphers specifically the Caesar Cipher. This is simply shift the letters down by n letters in the alphabet. So HELLO would become IFMMP if the key was . Obviously IFMMP isnt readable to me as a human and makes no sense at all. However just like I could move  letter down to encrypt I can reverse it by moving  letter up. You can pick any key you want so you could choose to shift by  or shift by say  in which case the ciphertext would be ROVVY. What keeps the message secure is not the structure of the algorithm but the secrecy of the key. Obviously the problem with this cipher is there are only  possible keys meaning you can brute force it try all the possible key combinations easily with even a spreadsheet. The most commonly used modern cipher AES has a keyspace of  which is so large that it is functionally impossible to brute force in any reasonable amount of time even with supercomputers.,LifeProTips,crh8dv2,3,t5_2s5oq

There are a few not a lot of cases where wheels have fractured due to insane overtorquing  causing metal fatigue.  Usually the biggest problem is not being able to get the wheel off or the wheel falling off. I have my own torque wrench and as instructed by the manufacturers and tire shops etc I recheck torque after driving about  km and out of about  complete car rechecks Ive found four or five nuts that were about a halfturn or one full turn loose meaning they couldve backed off and even completely fallen off the car.,LifeProTips,crtjfy5,1,t5_2s5oq

Uninstall any programs you dont use.. Run a registry cleaner like CCleaner..  Use autoruns  stop useless shit from getting started at bootup like javaflashetc. updaters google bloatware and so on  practically everything that is not part of the operating system. If you dont know whats what Autoruns builtin search or a quick google search will help.. It might sound a bit unorthodox but you can uninstall any antivirus programs if you dont put foreign USB keys or CDsDVDs in your PC. You need a firewall an okay one is included in Windows since  and thats it. I install various topnotch antivirus programs  times a year have them scan my computer to find nothing and promptly uninstall them. I havent had a PC virus infection in at least  years despite using the internet daily without antivirus software.Sometimes your windows is just too old and bloated then you need to reinstall it from scratch preferably letting it format the drive while doing so but you should know what to back up first passwords bookmarks documents saved games etc. so ask a pro if you are not confident.Very rarely the slowness is caused by missing or bad drivers for your hardware. Use windows Device Manager to see if your hardware has proper drivers installed. You dont need the latest drivers for everything but you certainly need working ones. If you see problems in the device manager like this ask someone to help you out installing proper drivers or use a program like the Auslogics Driver Updater.,LifeProTips,crtzp1b,-1,t5_2s5oq

4214589,0,t3_3944f9,Theres no way to do it but to do it. You probably need a strategic plan though. Figure out your goals then think through ALL the steps youll need to take to make them happen. Having it written down or typed into your computer or smartphone is KEY. Have a mature someone you would use as a role model friend help you work through your plan to make sure youre not leaving things out and also give you some ideas. Remember  plans have benchmarks and deadlines!For example a goal might be to move into your own apartment. Your plan might go something like thisGOAL Move into my own apartment within six months.Step  Figure out ALL my apartment needs with regard to budget roommates location furnitureapplicances. Make a list of important needs own bedroom and things that may be negotiable has swimming pool and gym. Deadline st month.Step  Research available apartment situations considering budget and preferences. Develop list of top  prospects. To be completed in nd month.Step  Visit and tour top  apartments. Get copies of leases and conditions. Make sure I understand deposits and utilities not included in rent. Pick top  apartments. To be completed in rd month.Step  Discuss apartment situation with parents or my mature friendrole model. Have them review leases and conditions of  top apartments. Have them visit  top apartments and offer any suggestions. To be completed in next  weeks.Step  Make decision and sign lease paying deposit. Get movein date. To be completed in next  weeks.Step  For any utilities not included in rent  sign up for those utilities. Your landlord should have a list with addresses of where to go. Some utilities may need deposits. If you have a roommate you may need to figure out who will be responsible for which utility. To be completed in th month.Step  Get your keys from your landlord. Get friends and family to help you move in! Pizza and beverages are usually required as a thankyou.  To be completed in th month.Hooray! You did it! Youre in your own apartment in six months!Sometimes there will be challenges and stumbling blocks like theres a deposit you didnt anticipate or your initial list of apartments doesnt yield a good selection. That happens but having a strategic plan is good because it allows you to focus only on the challenge  youve already worked out everything else. If you need to alter your plan a bit thats fine too.,LifeProTips,cs0nbq6,1,t5_2s5oq

If your accident occurred in a parking lot theres nothing we can do private property.Furthermore even if it is on the road we mainly only help exchange info. We dont actually write a report unless theres injuries and such involved. Literally we write the info to each party on a sheet of paper and just hand each party a copy. Depending on where it happened and how busy we are with higher priority calls Ive seen auto accident calls hold for  minutes. Not because we are lazy. but because someone got shot or theres a robbery that occurred nearby so that obviously takes precedence. In summary if no one is hurt or if youre able to move your vehicles out of the road and such its easier just to exchange your info and take it up with the insurance company. ,LifeProTips,cs3j49g,1,t5_2s5oq

4335309,0,t3_3anr9k,Three suggestions.   Wait for or make up some event that is early that you just cant miss.   For instance an early flight fishing at the crack of dawn making breakfast in bed for your SO... basically anything that will force you out of bed.  That night go to bed slightly earlier than normal and wake up at the same early time the next morning.  It will take many days nights but eventually your body will be used to it.   Dont set early alarms and snooze.  Your sleep quality will suffer and you will be groggy.  Set one alarm at the time you need to be up then follow it.   Go to bed and fall asleep a multiple of  minutes before you need to get up.  Normal sleep cycles last   min. and waking up is easier at the start of a cycle instead of  in the middle.  See this link for the science behind it.TLDR  Wake up early one day and stick to it.  Only set  alarm.

You cant just go around telling people that you dont lose weight by exercising. Its a huge load of shit and I explained why in my original comment. Exercise and diet are EQUALLY IMPORTANT in living a healthy lifestyle. If you ask ANY doctor ANY physician ANYONE that has an expertise in healthy living they will tell you exactly what I just told you. Just because you lost weight by not eating doesnt mean there isnt a healthier way to lose it. Yea it helped you get where you wanted but what you wanted was to be not fat. You didnt consider exercise at all and because you didnt have to exercise to be not fat you think nobody else should exercise. And somehow you made it up in your head that you dont lose weight by exercising. Seriously good on you for losing lbs thats incredible. But there is a healthier way to do it.

The worst that happens is shell turn away and you can try again later assuming shes still otherwise attracted to you and not just a little uncomfortable with you still. Shell consider it a compliment that you tried and youll get points for having balls.In contrast asking is neutral at best and makes you look like an unconfident doofus at worst. Women as a rule prefer their men to act like men.Note that this is not an endorsement to pester some woman you met at a bar until she calls the police because you keep stalking her and trying to kiss her.

4529324,0,t1_ct1jfwe,gt I believe this is your opinion. You would be incorrect.For example Verbal I.Q on the WAIS carries the most significant correlation with academic success more than double the predictive power of the performative I.Q section.In fact literally speaking tasks which focus on verbal abilities are considered to be the most gloaded in psychometrics. Which means they correlate the strongest with general cognitive ability.The single most predictive items on any given intelligence tests are usually questions relating to manipulating analogies for example.Here is a quick chart demonstrating how variance on different subjects within multiple iterations of two I.Q tests across multiple decades correlates to the to the final metric of general cognitive ability.Essentially this chart shows how much your relative position in each subject predicts your overall ability. In every single iteration a high variance in vocabulary information and comprehension ended up being the greatest determining factors in having high general cognitive ability. Having a higher than average score in vocabulary ends up being far more predictive of success than say a higher than average score in arithmetic or coding.This was discovered even in  when research discovered that excelling in studies of classical literature was the greatest predictor of success. More so than mathematics music or a language class.TLDR Research has shown that scoring above average on a measure of the ability to manipulate and recall vocabulary has more predictive power of success and general ability than scoring above average on any other metric including arithmetic.The problem with these tests is while they are fantastic for testing people within a culture they must be carefully targeted. You are literally testing the ability of a person to meet the demands of a specific society which does not generalize well outside that society.More information can be acquired by googling g and verbal I.Q. I would cite more but I dont have my text books anymore and its been a long time since I studied cognitive psychology.,LifeProTips,ct1k29c,0,t5_2s5oq

4540343,0,t1_ct2uxfe,Well...its not so much about the water content as it is the fiber. Fruit has a lot of sugar carbs in it but most fruits also have fiber which slows the absorption of that sugar leaving you sated for a longer. This is why juice isnt all that good for you even if it is fresh squeezed. It is just sugar water with a high calorie content and zero fiber.  If that sugar isnt burned off it is essentially stored as fat. Also the insulin spike resulting from the blood sugar spike shuts down the mechanism for the body to consume body fat. The insulin spike is then followed by a blood sugar crash which leaves you hungry and wanting to eat again soon after.,LifeProTips,ct2xtgy,5,t5_2s5oq

However if the hosts serve dessert and then open up a new bottle of wine or offer up a new activity your good to continue to party. I posted this because I was reminded last night of a party I had been to where my cousin had to invite the family of her step mother over for her fathers retirement party. Nobody really felt comfortable with them there because it had been a bad divorce between her mother and father so she couldnt wait to get the dessert out. When she did it was like a cue light went off they grabbed something quick thanked her for the party and they were out. ,LifeProTips,ct6omp5,-2,t5_2s5oq

4666031,0,t1_ctip1oa,Where abouts do you live? Im in Nor Cal so I have some connections here. I worked at a Grad school that had a therapy program so wed would get calls for referrals occasionally. You might try to call any therapy programs in youre area and see what referrals they can give you. Asking friends for their therapy experiences is usually a good way to find a good therapist. Also I would recommend a book called Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend. It has lots of good info. If therapy is expensive look for churches with trained therapists or at least a counseling program run by a trained therapist. If what a church offers its not someone trained in psychology they can do more harm than good in a situation like this. Some graduate level therapy programs also have students who will provide therapy cheaply. Everyone should be supervised by an experienced therapist so even if your therapist is inexperienced there is someone backing them up who has lots more time in the field. Hope this helps!

Theyd leave a message not just immediately move on to the next person they were considering. Now if were talking an interview or a minimum wage job maybe. This is similar to people who think telling the hiring manager you need  hours to consider a job offer will make you lose it. That shit doesnt happen. If Im wrong and it sometimes does then those hiring managersHRreps are bad at their jobs or have huge superiority complexes.

Generally this would be after the final punchlist is created and initial QC is done but before site restoration and cleanup.Liquidated damages are a perday amount specified in the contract in which the contractor will be penalized for not completing the job by the deadline. My contracts are usually day beyond the date of substantial completion. Residential contracts can be less. Theres an EJCDC formula its based on the total contract price and scope of work. If liquidated damages are assessed on a contractor it can have a detrimental effect their insurance and bonding costs and possibly prequalification requirements for certain contracts.Performance bonding is a bond from a surety company that guarantees performance of the contracted work. Performance Bonds usually also include a Payment Bond which does the same thing but ensures that subcontractors and suppliers are paid by the prime contractor. Payment bonds prevent a subcontractor or supplier from placing a lien on the owners property because the prime contractor didnt pay them. If the contractor defaults on the contract or doesnt pay their subcontractors you can pull the bond and the surety will pay a new contractor to come in and finish the job or pay the subcontractors in full. Ive never had to do this before because Im pretty sure having a bond pulled ensures that a contractor will never get another bond and can effectively put them out of business. Usually a letter threatening to pull a bond is enough to get the job done.This is why you see a lot of construction companies advertise that they are bonded. It means that they finish the job on time every time.,LifeProTips,ctq3yx8,35,t5_2s5oq

It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter. If you cant do the little things right you will never do the big things right. And if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is madethat you madeand a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

A lot of older shittier phones support this feature but it usually only requires a kernel recompile to get it to work on a phone that doesnt support the feature. Root is required for control not adding in a feature that wasnt already there. Most people arent expected to need to connect to a wifi network and rebroadcast the signal its just illogical. Its only logical for repeating a signal something that most people wont need to do as it would only be logical in certain rare situations my phones hotspot range is decent but put a good stone wall in between and the speed drops dramatically. Wait I just realized I skipped your nd paragraph lol you said the same thing I did. Youre kind of right anyway but its hit or miss which phone FQrouter I personally pronounce it fuckyou router cuz its more fun and when it doesnt work its like the author sayin fuck you sidenote will run on.But in principle it can be done. Most people wont need to use it especially US users where most homes dont have concrete walls. My home has  nice thick concrete walls between me and the router. My speeds drop from the already shitty Mbits we sometimes receive if the weather conditions are correct paying for ...wimax coverage sucks here to .Mbits usually. I only found out about fqrouter since I didnt feel like lugging my desktop to the other room just so i can get my downloads finished faster laptop charger has a blown fuse fml So yeah very very rare circumstances lol.

4870322,0,t1_ctwa9ct,Releasing anger vocally encourages more anger and resentment not only at the person youre yelling at but also often towards yourself.Lets just make clear what a dad voice is. As far as I understand a dad voice is a tone that remains calm clear genuine logical rational and reasonable mature. This is what I think of when I hear dad voice.As far as this example goes Im discussing two mature physiologicallyover the age of  adults conversing.If someone isnt using a dad voice and is belligerently angry to the point that they respond even more aggressively to a dad voice then the best thing you can do is walk away. Responding aggressively isnt appropriate and will likely result in you becoming angry. Being submissive isnt appropriate and will likely result in you becoming angry and resentful later besides forging bad relationship precedent that may turn abusive. Tell them that the conversation will continue when everyone can speak calmly. Later after they have obviously calmed down return to the conversation and try to clear things up.If they refuse to speak about it later then theyre likely bottling it up and holding it against you internally intentionally albeit irrationally blaming you for making them angry. They dont want peace. They dont really want a good communicable relationship. They want to feel powerful likely to satisfy some feeling of insecurity. They want to see you lose your cognitive status and drop to your baser carnal self less capable of forming valid clear thoughts more reactive instead of proactive.There is NEVER a good reason to yell except of course if someone is far away and couldnt hear you otherwise or in times of danger to alert someone. If someone refuses to act like an adult then treat them like a child.,LifeProTips,cu8fwbt,1,t5_2s5oq

In fact it can be rude not to talk to others! other people are not above you and you dont require their permission to engage in conversation.Now with that said not everyone will want to continue talking to you and that is that is okay! Once you start read their body language. If theyre not inteested politely leave. They dont care about you dont care about them. Serisouly dont spend another moment thinking about it. Move on. This is what some people mistake as confidence. Keep at it. At first youll be awkward there will be silences and people will quickly become disinterested. But like any skill with practise youll get good at it. With some time youll find that instead of just making conversation youll be networking... making friends even.

I dont have to be nicotine free forever but I do want to try for at least one more day.This has been one of my more successful tries to get free of that shit and with this helpful monster thinking Ill probably do better still. Im finding it easier this time than when I put up goals for myself of when Ive been smoke free for a month Ill get to buy myself something nice and such.I like the image of the addiction being a road and getting off is to choose the little used and almost overgrown path beside the road. Its hard and not very enjoyable at first but the longer you keep off the big and well kept road the more itll deteriorate and the easier and more level the little path will become. But if you fall for the addiction you go onto the big road again and its like a crew of repairmen go over it and makes it nice again. So the struggle starts anew.

Do something unique to you but dont be a weirdo. Be human. I have learned that the higher you go up the food chain with a company the more sterile and robotic everyone seems to become. Talk to your everyone you work with like an actual person. Interpersonal skills will open more doors then most everything else.  Be transparent. If you screw up be the first to acknowledge it.

The location of the Men in Black ride used to be the location of the set from the Swamp Thing TV show and the back of the park had a replica of the Psycho house and Bates motel near the old exit and original Hard Rock on property. They filmed Psycho  there.  In the past few years it has hosted a few productions here and there. It is still very much a functioning movie studio. Thats why the areas are themed as New York London Hollywood San Francisco World Expo Springfield and so on. The facades in the park give the appearance of being in another location without the weather monetary or other constraints of those locations. The productions I remember are a Beethoven movie A Bring it on Sequel Ace Ventura  The tooth fairy with Larry the Cable Guy Family Feud with Steve Harvey over  episodes filmed Final destination the US version of the Inbetweeners and recently Sharknado . I know Nsync filmed a music video there as did Creed who I think shot  in the park since they are both from Orlando.

I do have a big picture answer.  I have spent a lot time working out what is important to me in life.  How I want to live my day to day life.  And I have taken the time to identify in what way my todo list supports those values.  So I really want to do everything on the list.  If I want to do everything I want to do in a day it takes about  hours usually.  So I better get up and get going. My biggest temptation is tv and internet.  When I am over tired and stressed out I want to stare at a screen. So I might wallow in a season of House of Card and stay up until am.  Then the next day I can either feel like shit and be grumpy and snappy to my husband and son take a long morning nap and have a messy house and skip my workout or take the nap get everything done but spend no quality time with my son and husband.

I also recommend that you not be a pussy who thinks just because something can be used as a weapon automatically means that is all it ever will be used for.

5304782,0,t3_3nkseo,Can confirm for fellow syrup lovers.Brothers an RCMP officer and I asked him about carrying a knife. If a peace officer ever asks why you have a knife simply reply I use it strictly for huntingvehicle safetybasic utilities like cutting open boxes. IF you carry a knife for the purposes of self defense it is considered a weapon and if its in your pocket youre looking at concealed weapon charges. Personally I carry a knife for two reasons opening boxes and bags at work and in case of an emergency... My father and brother have told me horrific stories of people trapped in their vehicles after an accident. The seat belt did its job but is prone to jamming after significant strain. The knife I carry has a glass smasher and seat belt cutter built in so it would be easy to explain to a peace officer why I have it. The reason why I bought one in the first place is because the Canadian Armed Forces only issue knives to pilots and loadmasters in case of a crash landing. Being a technician on board were not allowed to be issued one due to the fact were not considered crew. Which is weird because were listed as crew members on the manifest. ,LifeProTips,cvpqx9v,1,t5_2s5oq

As much as it hurt when she started dating someone else it helped me lose some hope and accept that it was real.  Theres still a laundry list of things that remind me of her that I have to avoid like the plague but it doesnt crush me like it used to.  The dreams are the worst though.  I cant shove them deep down like I can do with most of it during the day. To be perfectly honest the science behind it is what saved me and allowed me to detach.  As I was experiencing panic attacks and sadness and all the other bullshit Im sure youve experienced I latched on to finding out what was chemically happening to me.  Somehow knowing what was hurting me so badly helped me deal with it.  Its not magic its chemical dependency and if someone else can shake heroin I can shake this.Coincidentally my first girlfriend just reconnected with me.  She was the only other person I felt this way about and I hadnt talked to her in probably  years.  To my surprise it was just like talking to an old friend.  No pain no awkwardness.  I guess it always gets better it just takes a fuck load of time.,LifeProTips,cvxr2uk,5,t5_2s5oq

5379745,0,t1_cvyrvx1,Nope your always always always is wrong!I was responding to someone who said that you hooked up two nonrunning cars and then start one then the other.  Thats wrong.  Youre dividing one good battery over  circuits when you do that.  Sorry for not explaining the real way that a car should be jumped. Dead car dead.. Live car running.. Connect dead car positive. Connect live car positive.. Connect dead car ground metal on the chassis NOT the black terminal on the battery.. Connect live car ground metal on the chassis NOT the black terminal on the battery.. Let sit  minutes then start dead car.To say that dead batteries give off flammable gas is not particularly nuanced car batteries generate hydrogen when used in highcurrent applications as in starting a car and trying to start a car on a dead battery means you were repeatedly tasking the battery to provide current that it was unable to fulfill.Thus the critical safety point is that the circuit you are creating must be completed at the LIVE CAR as a last step because you WILL jump a spark when the circuit completes and it is exceedingly dangerous to generate that spark under the hood of a car that has been turned over many times.  You also do not hook up the dead car first because that will create live wires that can touch and arc on the ground.  One step at a time back and forth in sequence.,LifeProTips,cvzbmwc,1,t5_2s5oq

They dont have the ability to just magically feel great about themselves. By faking confidence in small ways which can even just be looking people in the eye when you shake their hands or speaking up in a meeting you break down that fear that people will react negatively to you. In fact people react positively to confidence which in turn helps you feel good about yourself and can lead to real confidence.

5567793,0,t3_3rd67i,i added my old router to the new one via wire. Set my old one up so its modem function was disabled and only functioned as an extension of the new modemrouter. Simultaneously it works as a second wifi spot in the other part of the house. Gave both routers the same name and password and voila... instantaneous switching between closest wifi spots. only work on desktop pc so i always work with wires. Only thing i had to do was disable something in the DNS configuration and set the ip adress so router  was in the ip range of router  and it did the rest itself. Also set both up to occupy a certain channel. in a crowded neighbourhood dynamic channel lookup works shitty and gives a lot of disconnects. Now i rarely have trouble.,LifeProTips,cwn8hsu,1,t5_2s5oq

Unless you already have access to a good deal of money this is pretty much your only option.With that out of the way there are a good number of options for you that dont involve punching the clock as an employee at a brick and mortar workplace.    get paid to write promotional and technical material Learn HTML and CSS basics taught free at  and start taking some entrylevel freelance web design jobs. I have friends making k who still do this one or two evenings a month for play money.  Beer bottles and scrap metal and junk removal. If youre saving for a education program you could even do a bottle drive to raise funds. Hand out flyers in person works best promoting it and when youll be in that area doing pick ups.  Repair things. YouTube and sites like  have a wealth of knowledge on how things work and more importantly how they should work and how to  fix them. In many cases you only need simple tools. You can charge money doing repairs for clients and you can buy broken goods fix them and sell them for profit.

5714820,0,t1_cx4tg2j,That just sounds like normal distraction problems I think everyone has a level of self distraction but you never know. I was diagnosed with ADD at a young age and it feels like a constant cloud in my mind that is difficult to see through. My mind is always searching for more information thats the issue with ADD I think. When we arent stimulated our brains will immediately seek out any other source of information intake or sensory stimulation. We get bored and switch to new tasks so often we dont notice it happening and its hard to get things done. But on the flip side if we find a steady stream of mental food like start writing a song and its going well or start cleaning the house with just the right music on you can get sucked in to one task for hours or obsess for days. When I get really engaged in my work I find myself totally forgetting to eat a single meal in the day and neglecting every other responsibility I had even though I had time. Weed helps a ton. Using it with just a little of my meds gives me a really strong balance of focus and calm. If anyone is interested Ive tried most of the meds that are out there and hated most Focalin has been my favorite by far.

It doesnt The only thing that will make your water taste smell and look clear and crisp is Activated Carbon AKA a Britta filer or something along those lines that have active carbon in it. Beyond that its doing nothing. Not to mention there are much better ways to remove TDS then an R.O. unit if you are REALLY that bothered by calcium and  other minerals in your water. You need to get a whole water filtration system with a water softener manage the salt brine  Deal with back wash etc etc. So really you need to ask yourself.

5831520,0,t3_3v0cze,This will get buried but whatever... A lot of you are forgetting a very important role of the externalagency recruiter. If the recruiter is reaching out to you about a job that you didnt know exist and youre interested  then theyve done you a great service. It would be a super skeeze ball move to go on and apply directly. Recruiters are match makers plain and simple. Recruiters push you through to the front of the line and are in contact with the people in a position to hire you. Dont get me wrong theres definitely shitbag recruiters out there. But most people here are pretending like agency recruiters arent providing a good or service. Theyre a great resource to use for job hunting for candidates and for companies to fill open positions especially in a high growth phase. Theyre not the end all be all but a supplementary tool that can come in very handy. Do they care about you as a person? Maybe maybe not. Its a business. Will they be at your daughters graduation this May? What the fuck do you think? The answer is of course not theyre doing a job. Its business and theyre doing a job that you can benefit from. Theyre not there to sing you sing nighttime lullabies and give you massages. Once again they are a tool not the answer to your prayers.External recruiting is a sales job. Plain and simple. They sell candidates to companies and companies to candidates. The candidate is a product. The company is a product. Dont take it personally. NewsFlash Most people you interact with in a business environment dont care about you. They care about what you can offer them in terms of business  especially in sales and recruiting. This might be a tough pill to swallow for some of you sensitive folk.EndRant,LifeProTips,cxk1eoo,1,t5_2s5oq

Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend a chance encounter with a book or from a personal faith. For Janet help came from her faith but it also from a squirrel. Shortly after her divorce Janet lost her father then she lost her job. She had mounting money problems. But Janet not only survived she worked her way out of despondency and now she says life is good again. How could this happen? She told me that late one Autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter one at a time he would take them to the nest. And she thought if that squirrel can take care of himself with the harsh winter coming along then so can I. Once I broke my problems into small pieces I was able to carry them just like those acorns one at a time. The White Stripes,LifeProTips,cxkus6i,1,t5_2s5oq

5939124,0,t3_3wofj6,I learned this one recently. Bought a friend of the family the best quality gin  based on online research for martini lovers. And I bought gin because I learned through said research as I am obviously not a martini drinker myself that authentic martinis are made with gin not vodka. Thus if someone refers to just martinis they are drinking it with gin. Its only if they specify a vodka martini that they want it with vodka.With this new found knowledge I spent more than I would have liked on this person tbh trying to get them something they would actually use. I knew they liked martinis because they always talk about martinis.  And like many people can be theyre otherwise hard to shop for and could just buy anything they want. But they meant something to someone I care about so...I tried.When they opened it up they said Oh. This will be nice to have around the house if anyone comes to visit us that drinks gin martinis. |I offered to exchange it for vodka that they would actually drink themselves but they wouldnt budge. So I gave up. But it is the last time I will try to do something like that. At least unless I know for a fact exactly what they would like and use.

5952867,0,t1_cxzwmy3,Yes indeed. I tell my wife about all the feelings I have including feelings towards other women. It doesnt make her jealous. That makes no sense.

If I wanted to be intimate with another woman I wouldnt tell her about it. And then the problems would start. I dont know what crush even means. Sometimes I meet women who if I werent happily married I would have sex with. Is that a crush? I dont think so. I have no desire to be emotionally intimate with anyone besides my wife. Its a LOT of work and it takes a LONG time to develop the kind of relationship that we have. Our culture also puts too much of an emphasis on sex and sexuality. I dont mean that in a prudish Puritanical kind of way. I mean that the most intimate relationship I have ever had with a woman my wife is probably less than  about sex. Sure we have plenty for both of us but its not that big a deal. Its yet another biological imperative and we need it to function properly psychologically and emotionally.

5954176,0,t1_cxzyyr9,I think its the way you talk to the person and how the two of your are individually.  Going So this girl at work is totally hot and we have a lot in common. Definitely crushing is not the right way to do it. But my fiancee and I discuss my crushes all the time and theres nothing awkward about it.From what you described you have reservations from previous relationships that have nothing to do with your husband. And thats ok! Most people do. Your husband telling you he has a crush or viceversa would probably cause more harm than good.I was the same way until my fiancee and I had a very long conversation after I very briefly broke up with him because I was having strong feelings for someone else early in our relationship. I had to literally throw up on the side of a busy highway from missing him so much to figure this out.That very long conversation which spanned days for us resulted in being  secure in our relationship. What I mean by  secure is completely and totally trusting the other person with the ability to shatter you and wholeheartedly believing they wont. We can tell each other absolutely everything past and present with no fear because we know that were not trying to hurt each other.  Its the scariest most freeing feeling in the world that most people dont get back to once theyve been hurt once before.Now I can tell my fiancee I have a crush on soandso and hell say I can see how hes your type but XY and Z habits would drive you nuts!. We both know that Im not leaving my fiancee for this other person so we can say things like this.TLDR Telling your SO about crushes is ok if you first make sure that you and your SO can handle those types of conversations.,LifeProTips,cy04fks,24,t5_2s5oq

I understandWhat is hard and where I hear these stories... is when we go to the same house three times a week for the same  year old gentleman off his meds who is terrorizing his elderly parents and has the strength of five officers... and for some reason has a bat in his room.   We cant take a guy to jail for not being on his meds.   We have nowhere to bring him.   And he doesnt want to go to the hospital... and his parents are crying in the driveway and of no help.Now a cop has to go in there while a guy has a bat again and try not to form another horror story.I dont know or think there are any good answers in any of this.  I am basically typing out of desperation at this point.I spent years of my life volunteering and working with amazing people that were different.

6354914,0,t3_42lhgc,There are a few ways salesmen can rebuttal this such as we have great financing... Or changing the price like my friends above said. I have found a better way is to say Im good. There is no counter argument because good doesnt imply that you are not interested or unsure. It simply means you wont buy and refuse to listen to why you should. The best part is it can be used repeatedly. If some one says have you tried...? And you say Im good. Youre communicating that you are going to be very difficult to sell to because you are refusing to listen to them. Anything they say after can be interrupted with another Im good. And if you really want to drive it home wait until they have said all they have to say then wait a couple more seconds and say Im good. I used to be a canvasserdoordoor guy and I would hate it when people did this to me. It takes way more time and energy to convince someone they are wrong than it does to say Im good.

6360328,0,t1_czc0v1u,I visited my girlfriends cousins house. She has an untrained demon of a pitbull. As soon as I came in the door the dog ran towards me lowered its tail and barked incessantly. Growling showing its teeth. The only thing the owner said is oh he absolutely hates any male that comes into the house! like it was something funny. I told my girlfriend we were leaving. Didnt even make it  feet into the house. Every time I stepped forward the dog freaked out. I had my gun with me. If that dog would have bit me good and latched on I would have killed it. Its not cute that your pit bull which has a lot of negative stigma already is untrained and tries to attack any male that enters your house. Be a good owner and stop giving your dog breed a bad name. ,LifeProTips,czcljw7,2,t5_2s5oq

6361987,0,t1_czcm4vp,Why would it be silly to ask if you can pat someones dog? Its like picking up a turtle on the roadside you should check to make sure its a painted turtle and not a snapper before you pick it up. The dog owners not going to know your intentions until you communicate with them and let them know. Its about saying hey your dogs cute but I need to know if itll tear my pinkie off before I touch it.As for the thing about kids you forget that children are generally capable of clearly communicating with us. Typically a kid wont bite your hand off because you shook hands with them. Theyll introduce themselves because theyre developing social skills and learning how to connect contexts with appropriate behaviour. If there are human beings batshit crazy enough that they wouldbite you for shaking hands you generally get the feeling that something isnt right with them due to a change in social behaviours.A dog is not going to understand all of our social cues and communications because they arent human and conversely were not always the best at understanding them.

6379472,0,t3_430dm4,I used to have the same issue and I know the frustration. It took me a LONG time to realize this but the causes of my stuttering were always very much in my subconscious mind. My stuttering usually came from a conflicting thought process that had nothing to do with my ability to speak but caused mental hesitation which resulted in a momentary or sometimes a prolonged stutter or speech block.For me the solution was to give myself permission to be myself and speak at my own pace which I found is easier said than done. It boiled down to more of a confidence issue than anything  I needed to concentrate less on sounding perfect and simply allow my thoughts to flow out verbally in the same way that I can breathe without overthinking it my speech should work the same way.Smooth speech happens when were relaxed and most people are relaxed when theyre confident in who they are and what were saying.

Social interaction skills are something that you develop by interacting socially with other people. They are just that skills that you develop through practice. It is not facts and formulas that you can learn theoretically and have them be useful. Nobody ever developed social skills by reading a Reddit post.You cant learn about it in a book. At least not effectively. And Id say that reading too much about it causes you to overthink everything and that in turn makes it worse. So too much research might actually be detrimental.Stop spending so much time on social media. Go talk to people. Make mistakes. Realize that nobody cares. Learn to read body language and tone. That is how you develop social skills. Also dude... Youre not going to get fired for being socially awkward. Not unless youre also failing at your job in other ways. ,LifeProTips,czl0ano,14,t5_2s5oq

6477965,0,t1_czpbyx9,I agree with you. It really depends on the athlete and imo hs sports dont really mean shit and the goal should be to get talented and hardworking kids to the next level. Of course being part of a team is an important part of character development. But I do not believe that the long term goals of certain athletes should be stymied in favor of winning some tiny conference game or whatever in hs. For what its worth I skipped practices in hs to do additional work related to my sport track and field. I was kicked off the team for it. I also was the only member of that team to continue the sport at the collegiate level. The coach wanted me doing things that I did not believe in doing. I was way ahead of where my teammates were and nearly all of that was due to having the drive to workout and do the little things on my own. My coach hated me but my peers did not. I think that is a huge tell the team will know who is a shit bag and who isnt. So many hs coaches are about authority and control and nothing else. It is sad. ,LifeProTips,czpdabl,7,t5_2s5oq

You can either walk away just stop posting you dont owe him any explanations ... or beat them at their own game which they are usually not prepared for  but know that to the outside it will just look like  idiots fighting  they wont care who threw the first punch. A big part of what theyre doing is getting you to consider and respond to their BS turn that around and focus on them and their argument ask them for clarification on what they mean and laugh at it pull it out of context and make them look bad in short use their own tricks ...

Manager note on the survey was thank you for capturing his info.On the other hand I bent over backwards for this old couple who utterly borked their computer and wanted us to fix their fuckup for free. Spent an hour with them while my line backed up an hour on their stuff after they left was nice as fuck and really went to bat for them. They didnt just get their free labor they got goodies on the side. Their survey likewise said I was a huge piece of shit but if I had done things the way they wanted I would not only have been  fired but likely also charged with theft of service  which depending on how they rang the service bill could have been a felony.,LifeProTips,d05mcgr,23,t5_2s5oq

Instead I would recommend having a response ready when that thought arrives a kind of antidote thought. Then it becomes a kind of mindful game.  When you notice you are worrying about what other people are thinking about you stop and name it I am worrying about what they think.  This can frequently be enough to just dissolve the worryjudgment thought train.  However you can also follow with an antidote like Im proud to be me. or intentionally notice something good about the other person this  can be tough but it totally changes the focus and energy.  ,LifeProTips,d083aaq,1,t5_2s5oq

6712386,0,t3_47ird2,Ive been in activity director roles at senior living communities for over  years  PLEASE do NOT bring old games to donate. Ive thrown away so many and there are places that could actually use them like womens shelters or boysgirls clubs. Same goes for your old VHS tapes or DVDs! Seniors especially those living with dementia cannot maintain the focus required to play a board game or watch a movie. Its just a natural part of aging. Card games maybe  but definitely not board games. You might think that games designed for children would work because theyre quicker games but those are not age appropriate and therefore inappropriate to use in activity programming not to mention that seniors did not grow up playing Candy Land making it even more inappropriate because its not even a game that could be used to encourage reminiscing. And that bit about somebody could carry it around. No they wont. They might want to carry around a baby doll many individuals with dementia selfsoothe by mothering baby dolls or something soft as a sensory soother but I have never witnessed anyone carrying around a board game. Carrying items usually indicates an item is being used to selfsoothe or that the individual is rummaging or shopping but that type of behavior does not mean they are attached to those items just that they are moving items from one location to another usually in an effort to selfsoothe feelings of anxiety like most all behaviors.Please make an effort to better understand what is actually needed by your local senior living communitys activity department before unloading the items youve cleared from the back of your closet or garage shelves that you no longer want. Activity departments need things like simple craft supplies CDs with era appropriate music healthy house plants decks of playing cards photo frames birdseed magazines NOT celebrity trash types coffee table books with large photographs costume jewelry disposable cupsplatesnapkins for events and so much more. Best yet  volunteer your time! Even if you just come in to help pass out cupcakes at a birthday party youll be surprised at how easy it is to get wrapped up in having fun and meeting new people with the most amazing life stories or by being told over and over again how beautifulhandsome or nicesweetkindlovely you are seriously if you need an ego boost hang out at a nursing home. Senior living communities shouldnt be regarded as scary places or as onestopshops that will take in all kinds of discarded items. Theyre vibrant communities full of individuals trying to navigate this life just like the rest of us! TLDR Be mindful of what you donate to senior living communities! CallEmail and ask ahead of time! Volunteering is a great idea! ,LifeProTips,d0dm9pq,1253,t5_2s5oq

6719471,0,t3_47mq2w,I would absolutely agree with this in most situations although I personally found myself in a spot where playing hardball during the ... separation  and then resigning  worked out for the better. For almost a year before I quit I had sent many many emails and had many meetings with supervisors and directors bringing up concerns with the direction of the company and my responsibilities in addition to raising frequent issues and warnings about company best practices PampP and safety. These were ignored repeatedly and I became public enemy  for a companywide shakeup. I wrote a damning letter of resignation explaining how it was impossible to stay with the company and perform because of all these issues and how unless problems a b and c were fixed  and soon  the company was racing off a cliff and if the business continued as it was the only question would be how severe the final incident that ended things entirely would be. Less than one year later that company shut down because of a major safety incidentviolation and the town that it operated out of held a community meeting and unanimously voted to force the company out of the area. On my resume now  rather on job applications I did after that  I had to indicate that no it is not OK to contact my previous employer although they can try ... its just not possible as they no longer exist and all the previous directors have all either lost their licenses and not a recommendation I would value although I dont say that or have completely separated themselves from associating with that fiasco. I tell them that they can feel free to google the company several local newspapers wrote articles about it  it was one of the biggest employers in the area although disliked and it going out of business in the way it did was pretty big news for a small town and make sure I politely make everything I just mentioned clear to whoever Im speaking with.Had I done things nicely I still wouldnt have been able to contact anyone for a recommendation and there is zero chance I would find myself working for any of those people again I doubt they would be hired by any company in a position of authority or where they would have any say in my hiring and even if they were it would be a major red flag to not take that job. As it is I dont regret doing anything the way I did and I can easily frame the whole thing as a strength  that I was willing to provide uncomfortable but necessary feedback and spoke up repeatedly to my own detriment with the intention of protecting and helping the company and clients when I noticed the safety issues that eventually put it under.No its not great in situations where managersHRwhatever want someone who keeps their heads down and shuts the fuck up but for the most part the way everything went down opened up a lot of opportunity for me with different companies who value my contributions and that I have been very happy to work with.I know that this is not a common example but sometimes speaking up is a good thing... so long as its planned out and not done in a flurry of emotion and drama.,LifeProTips,d0eco2z,1,t5_2s5oq

They have already gone through the self blame game far too many times in their own head you dont need to add to that.You just need to be there be the safe haven they already think you are. Show them what a good person is. And how a good person should treat another human being. Dont be too pushy about professional help unless it was a recent rape or molestation then time is of the essence. This is a problem that will take years to deal with and will shape who they are for the rest of their lives. Let them go at their pace. But what you can do is do the leg work for them look into good psychiatrists find helpful information for them and present it to them. Let them decide what to do with that information. And save all the info you come across they may not want to use it right then but may come back to you later to get it again.

6864676,0,t3_49q4nt,Unfortunately pizza is so good whatever you do to it that a lot of people commenting here are demonstrating theyre perfectly happy with their inferior method.  Do not underrate the pan method until youve tried it!  Its so good that even when I get pizza delivered I pan fry it for a bit to get improve on the taste.  Go slow enough that it heats the whole thing and not just the crust or use a lid or foil to speed up the process.NOTE This method depends on the oils in the crust to make the magic happen.  If you have a really dry crust it may not be nearly as effective but fortunately most pizza crusts are pretty oily.,LifeProTips,d0uf6l0,1,t5_2s5oq

6909778,0,t1_d0ze9uo,gt Saying things along these lines can come off as arrogantIt all really boils down to know your audience. Sometimes you can have a talk in front of  people of people of varying skills including those without any skill at all. Or those same  people may be in the field learning a specific thing.If youre in the former group you have to go much slower or risk losing their interest entirely very early on. If youre in the latter group you risk being condescending if you dumb it down too much.At some point there has to be an understanding of minimum expectation of education on whatever youre talking about. If you dont know the minimum education start dumb and ask along the way. Ok raise your hand if you know about blah blah  Ok Ill skip over that great! Now on to....Ive had to train people on migrating from Wordperfect to Word on as trivial thing as fucking BOLDING text. These people were terrified of this change and demanded training on this brand new application that was nothing like Wordperfect. Except.. it was a lot like Wordperfect. This group of people were skittish and constantly needed to be reaffirmed that things start hard and get easier or else they would get angry and SUPER insecure. Heaven forbid they think their boss think any less of them because they dont grasp that a bolded B underlined U and italicized I meant the same across pretty much every application out there. These people technologically and intellectually were stuck in the s when it was hip to brag about knowing fuck all about computers.gt If a confidence boost is what they need reinforce their abilities. I think youre assuming a standard working professional environment. Not everyone is like that. Some people you have to dance very carefully around because they are insecure. Its not that they need a confidence boost as much as you cant damage their fragile ego.Sadly this comes at the expense of the rest of the group. You can either slow the group down.. or skip over those slow pokes. Either way youre going to have  of your group complain if your target is a wide audience and you dont have control over splitting people up.And yes  some things are not that complicated and are easy. For instance copying and pasting text as its a pretty fundamental thing. Out of  people you have  who lack fundamental information. Do you slow down the other ? Because those  are going to feel like youre being condescending to them because they already know this stuff.In these cases there is no win scenario for all people.gt If not keep breaking it down for them.While everyone else in the room waits impatiently. Instead considering if its just a small subset of people say youll come back to it at the end and talk to them personally.

Then you think maybe theyre letting me go or on their phone etc. So you inch oh. But they inch at the exact same time. So you stop immediately. Then they stop. Then you wave them on but they stay there. Then you inch forward again and lo and behold they inch with you almost fucking deliberately. So you floor it. Goddamned fucking polite assholes. The other day though I was driving home from a gas station there was a huge dump truck absolutely filled to the brim and it was behind me a good bit I come up to my turn which is riiiight over a little hill. Big enough to obstruct vision for both sides of the road. Apparently at that exact point in time one of my neighbors was pulling up to turn onto our road. I felt my stomach do a flip. The truck was far enough that I was going to let her go but guess what she wanted to be polite. So my mind is racing car isnt good enough to speed up out of the way of this truck thats probably going  mph I cant turn off the road because there is a very deep ditch so I just wave erratically beeping my horn and she gets it just as its almost too late right as Im turning into my road the truck flys by and I swear I can feel it shake my car from just the force of the wind. Please do not be polite while driving. Just do you get where youre going the way youre supposed to. I dont mind waiting  seconds while you do whatever so long as I know youre actually going to fucking do it because thats what Im counting on. ,LifeProTips,d13695q,7,t5_2s5oq

I learned about the symptoms in Psych  back in college and I recognized I was a textbook case it explained a lot of my issues I had in school growing up. So I sought out a therapist brought my transcripts from preschool yes through high school and I was diagnosed then and there.Now my pointPeople can be aware of any of their own limitations and do nothing to overcome them with or without ADHD. Its a difference between ignorance and stupidity.Some people are aware of their limitations and try to overcome them but find that they cantor rather that its very very hard to do. Perhaps it feels hopeless. If you couple that with nobody in your life being able to truly understand your difficulties then it just exacerbates the issue and fosters a defeatist attitude. Its rough to have a problem and feel utterly alone in trying to overcome it. Now its a strange line between a reason for behavior and an excuse for behavior. My point is theres a lot of nuance to consider here and I think its generally best to reserve judgement until youve been in their shoes. Or something. Im getting distracted so Ill stop here. ,LifeProTips,d1641hi,1,t5_2s5oq

I mean I completely understand how easy it can be to have that defeatist attitude but I just think the world is tough there are people who have it much harder than everyone any of us maybe that perspective doesnt help everyone but it does help me in understanding that however tough it is we can overcome it because thousands of people around the world who dont have the luxury of being defeated overcome these kinds of problems every single day. Overcome might be a strong word  what i really mean here is be functional Ive found helped me get up in the morning so eh. I guess I just think it is possible for better or for worse and if you dont try anymore if you just give up I might feel sorry for you for what youve been through that made you give up but I probably wont feel like hearing your excuses anymore. ,LifeProTips,d165652,1,t5_2s5oq

Wire cutters have many household uses beyond cutting zip ties including kitchen cutting wire wraps from some produce meats and opening some kitchen gadget packages gardening chicken wire electric wire to protect against pests auto maintenance and a wide range of hobbies and crafts.gt Makes more sense to use something you already have. Like clippers or a knife.If youre deadset on never buying another useful tool and never perform any of the aforementioned tasks perhaps.  As Ive already mentioned wire cutters are much safer for anyone in the household to use.  Maybe mom and dad dont want their year old kid who is still establishing manual dexterity to be messing around with nail clippers but something with an obvious grippy rubberized handle is much easier to handle.I dont know anyone who doesnt have a pair of cheap wire cutters in their home toolbox or hobby kit but to each their own.,LifeProTips,d16lk7z,11,t5_2s5oq

7015148,0,t3_4bqinz,Realize there are two very specific reasons you feel that way. Your voice typically you hear it by resonance through your own skull and tissues. When you talk to other people your voice sounds different to you than when you listen to it on audio. This is because on audio you dont get the added depth of sound reverberating through your body. Its not how youre used to hearing it. You can balance this out with conditioning.  Record yourself talking and listen to it over and over until it no longer sounds strange.. Your image again its not how youre used to seeing it. Even though elementary school math and science told you that your body is symmetrical it isnt. Not perfectly at least. Youre used to making yourself look good in a mirror and thats not the exact same image you see on video and in pictures. If this bothers you enough you can buy a true image type of mirror which is really just  mirrors at a fixed angle I think  degrees to each other placed at  degrees in relation to your face that reflect your image as others see it. Getting ready using this type of mirror will let you see how others see you and youll get used to that image of yourself.,LifeProTips,d1bik3x,1,t5_2s5oq

7066217,0,t3_4cdqds,If you havent read it already I highly recommend Keith Ferrazzis book Never Eat Alone and in particular Chapter  Be A Conference Commando which includes numerous tips for how to connect with people yes even introverts! at a conference. If I had to boil down the advice it would be  lots of people are under the incorrect impression that success at a conference means being Mr. Popular glad handed guy who is everybodys pal. And if you feel you are not that guy then you are some kind of failure not saying YOU feel this way just saying lots of people do. In fact you are far better off having a few deep AUTHENTIC interactions with people. Great quote from Keiths book the best way to have people think you are special is to make THEM feel special. The best way to do THAT is to really LISTEN to people. Also everybody at conferences tends to focus on trying to meet the bigwigs at the conference but you are almost always better off trying to meet the people who are GOING to be bigwigs in  to  years. Meet them NOW. Have deep authentic conversations about where your field is going and where you want YOUR career to go. Get interested in how you can help THEM. We tend to think well how can I help this other person when Im just getting started myself. But its amazing how much you can do to help other people when you focus your mind on it. Turns out their favorite paper in your field was written by someone at your program. And you can introduce them  hey Bob my friend Stan here is a HUGE fan of your paper about X and I figured you two would hit it off. Or turns out they really want to move to the East Coast where you live but theyve never been there and are kind of intimidated. So you can give them some pointers... You get the idea.

7137977,0,t3_4dat5e,This is also a strategy for higher dollar service rebate claims that can be worth quite a bit deep into the hundreds of dollars where the companies have a strong incentive to do everything they can to deny your claim For those who have never engaged something like a CableInternet contract rebate the process is absolutely as vexatious as possible to either  dissuade you from pursuing the rebate or  tripping you up on a technicality so they dont have to process your rebate claim because you failed to meet any one of the nine different elaborate paperwork steps buried in the ultra fine print. This is very much by design... then in a last gasp to chisel you out of your rebate the checks they send are disguised to look as much like junk mail as possible with the hopes youll throw them out. These companies have huge incentive to cheat you out of your rebate since a single claim can be worth   etc.Having been warned that a particular company that processed rebates for a certain cable company was notorious for this I filmed myself completing the rebate claim involving literally  different photocopies of different things putting it in an envelope and sending it away certified mail closing off the we never got it avenue of denial A couple months later when I got no response I uploaded the Youtube video of me assembling all the paperwork and putting it into envelopes sent them a link to it and told them Id take it down if my rebate arrived.

I know its weird   Happened to me and someone else I know.   If gyming is so bad you hate it its either because youre trying too hard or are already weak from not enough sleepfoodwrong food.There are a lot of foods I found that if I eat only them I feel weak as hell as if I hadnt ate anything all day. I realized not everything that stifles hunger is actually food theyre more of a filling.  Eggs meat potatoes are my staple foods seemingly salads and milk are also good just not only by themselves I think. I dont necessarily have all of those in a day but its like I need to have some of them every day.Something weird happened some days ago where I just ate jam on bread and I almost immediately felt tired as hell. I dont know why but I can only speculate the amount of sugar must be off the charts when I can eat candy bars and not get that reaction.  Diet and sleep has a big role in how much you can really exercise its not really necessary to exercise more than you do already to stay fit and its not worth changing your life just to appeal to some random girl I just thought Id mention because it might make you feel less tired generally.  This site could make it funner to exercise ,LifeProTips,d1ryssk,2,t5_2s5oq

My grandmother had a stroke a few weeks ago and I went to visit her. I bought a voice recorder while I was there and recorded some of my grandfather and fathers stories and musings. I intended on recording some of my grandmothers as well as soon as she recovered. Her chances were looking pretty good and then she had a second stroke and just like that she was gone forever. I am glad I got to record some things from my grandfather and my dad but I wish I had been able to get something from my grandmother. Now all I have left is a voicemail from her.,LifeProTips,d1wrwrg,1,t5_2s5oq

I would end up being late every day just from trying to find anywhere to park. I noticed in the parking garage right up front there were reserved parking spaces that were never occupied. I mean never.

7224636,0,t3_4eda3o,This happened to me once heres the story.Well I ride into work fairly often into San Francisco and park on the street in the motorcycle metered areas. And every once in a while Ill brainfart and just walk away wo paying for the meters and end up with a nice  ticket for being a dumbass.One night after finishing work I get back and find a ticket on my bike and Im especially pissed because I thought Id been fair conscientious about paying for the meter when I look closer at the ticket and notice its not my license plate .Mother Fcker. Some other rider got a ticket and decided to lay it on my bike hoping that Id pay for it without looking at it. This is jacked not only because its wrong but as a motorcycle rider there is a special brotherhood I feel for other riders as we have to survive in an automobile world. From the wave to helping each other out motorcycle riders typically have a sense of community with other riders.This could not stand. So I place the ticket in my wallet for safe keeping and stop by a Walgreens and pick up two bottles of super glue and every night I check the other motorcycle plates around me. Sure enough about  weeks later I have a match. Its a cruiser type bike with a fat leather seat.Now the moment of truth do I or dont I mess with another mans motorcycle? If I see someone messing with someone elses bike where Ive parked I would say something and if its my bike forgot about it! Kick some ass first and ask questions later! Would this guy be able to come back at me on my bike? How would I explain this to the cops if one drove by?And it came down to this for me would I regret not doing this more than doing it?So fck it! I double and triple check the license plate number check around me and dont see anyone close by take out the super glue and the ticket liberally apply the glue all over the ticket and slap it right on that nice leather seat.So I stop parking my bike on that particular street just in case but seriously Im sure he wouldnt have remembered what kind of bike he attached his ticket to and rode by that parking area every day after work until about a week later there his bike was again only this time I could see ticket partially torn off the seat but mostly embedded in the seat. Oh man there was such a feeling of elation I had!And there are several things I still relish about thisHis immediate reaction to seeing a ticket on his bike. Oh Ill just slap it on some schmucks bike.His reaction when the ticket tears and remains embedded on his leather seat and the fact he had to sit on it every time he rode until he spent good money replacing his seat.Karma can be a bitch!,LifeProTips,d1zdy6z,62,t5_2s5oq

7226924,0,t3_4ecney,I see a lot a of people talking about energy drinks or even drugs but Ive done over  hours without them. Heres a few tips  Stay hydrated  Make sure you have water available at all times and remember to drink even more so if you are on energy drinks.  Eat less more often  Big meals will make you sleepy but so will not eating enough. Have snacks regularly between small meals every  hours.  Stay active  You need to be moving or youll crash. Stand up if possible. If not or if you start feeling tired consider doing a couple exercises to get your blood flowing. Pushups or situps are a good option.  Avoid energy drinks  At least as long as possible. They come with a huge crash after a couple hours and youll be needing more and more which can be dangerous. Same goes for anything containing caffeine.  Beware of the morning  For some reason when morning comes your brain will try to make you sleep.

7239513,0,t3_4ejgqk,Some days its really difficult for me to wake up and get out of bed when this happens Ill play a few rounds of Mahjong or Spider Solitaire included with Windows  Sudoku is also good. I also do this when I have trouble focusing on things  thankfully the random nature of Mahjong means that its frequently unwinnable which frustrates me and allows me to get fired up and stop playing.Meditation is good and it doesnt have to be middle of a white living room while humming to yourself to be effective  I found that much of the time riding a chairlift while snowboarding was spent gazing out over the slope without thinking about anything which is very similar to some types of proper meditation.Ill go through a roller coaster effect of getting emails where I start to receive hundreds a day from various places because of me signing up etc. going through and unsubscribing from many helps clear my head.Skipping things like reddit and imgur and focusing on longform fiction or fiction youre familiar with I love Asimovs short stories helps give a respite from the overwhelming amount of information being hurled at us constantly.Going for walks is good even if youre very familiar with the area. Just being outside is generally helpful for most people even in the winter or extreme heat.  For the winter wear a hat and bring gloves long socks are nice too.  For the summer wear a hat and cover your arms if its very hot itll help cool you cool.I also want to say thank you for this post Ive been in a funk for the last year or so and am starting to become myself again and the ideas presented in this post have reminded me of things I used to do and will start doing again as well as given me new ideas.

My optometrist at WalMart no less was patient and gave me a two week pack to try it out and practice after she showed me how to use them  that way if I didnt like it I could later just get new glasses rather than buy a years worth of contacts. Im still fickle as fuck about things getting near my eye but Im fine with contacts. Contacts when put in properly feel like nothing. Its not a big deal at all. What I do is I always put contacts in while looking at a mirror and focus on the reflection to make sure I put the contact in right. Super easy like this. When I was first starting it was a bit difficult but you get over it quickly once you realize soft contacts feel like nothing! I thought I dropped it the first time.

We can easily find reasons why were not and tell ourselves that. Its OK to not know what you are doing. Youve only just started adulthood but stop seeing life as somewhere you have to get to and start seeing yourself as already arrived and if there is THING you want to achieve then go after it. Like this instead of going after an idea of being more selfpositive have a more concrete goal you can achieve like for example  Im going to say to myself each morning when Im in front of a mirror a reason Im successfulBut on the other side ride the waves of self doubt dont fight them let them pass like clouds look at them detach and analyse.

7363547,0,t1_d2exygw,Yes but its very easy to make the mistake where youre spending  hours a week in someones company and you get on well and so you think you have a decent friendship. I have plenty of former colleagues I got on great with and Im delighted any time I happen to cross paths with them. But theyve never been my friends. Ive never gone out my way to spend time with them outside of work or a work party. It can be hard when you first start working and start getting to know new people. You think youre all getting on great and then you leave or someone you like leaves and thats it whatever you thought you had is gone because in reality your only shared connection was work. And you might see that person once or twice more in your lifetime. The LPT in the OP is basically telling you not to make this mistake.

This has always worked for me I live in a suburb thats probably ish miles from the main drag of bars in my college town. Ive always read you should never tell the driver where youre going until you get in the cab. I always make sure to tip them extra as a  cab fee tip included is WAY cheaper than a DUI.

You ancestor argument is ridiculous. The argument relies on human interpretation of evolution and that there is an underlying purpose and reasoning to the system.Are you really suggesting that the inability to have kids means they are less of a human being? Some of the finest minds have contributed to society and allowed our species to flourish to ridiculous degrees while never propogating their genetic signature. Many people have lived happy successful fulfilling lives without the need for children.Having children is no more a right than any other man made preconception. No such thing as a right when it comes to nature. We have merely come to a point where a large proportion of our species has become complacent at basic survival necessities to categorise them as rights. In nature there is no right to food or water or shelter... or have children. They are all privileges that many take for granted day to day. Your friend probably has had to rethink many things they took for granted and may become a better person because of it. And perhaps if people like you stopped spreading this societal mollycoddling nonsense we wouldnt have so many oversensitive ignorant selfish people in the world. Same goes for spreading your own ideals as social expectation such as rearing children being something we should all aspire to do or somehow fail fundamentally as a human being many more people wouldnt feel trapped by their peers.,LifeProTips,d34kt0q,1,t5_2s5oq

Luckily we were in a school and had string and a coat hanger available to us.Basic idea is to tie a small slipknot in the string and feed it down the crack between the door gap and car body. We then used the coat hanger uncoiled to guide the knot around the physical door lock that pops up near the window. Once we had it in our little lasso we pulled it tight and lifted up to unlock it.Heres the video we watched to refresh ourselves how to do this,LifeProTips,d356wew,1,t5_2s5oq

Ask if they would like the managerownerchef to call to discuss the situation and if so when is a good time for that probably not right away since theyre about to be involved with an event.If you know youre going to be more than a couple of minutes late notify the person in charge and have them contact the customer immediately to let them know.  Not your fault is not a good excuse. If the delivery is out the door late then the customer needs to be notified before youve even left.It legitimate for a customer to speak to you about being late. You are the company representative at that moment. If nobody back at the home office will inform them that you will be tardy and even if they apologize on your behalf its appropriate for you to reiterate that apology then you get to take the complaint and relay it to your superiors.If youre late a lot then thats a problem that needs to be resolved. You should bring that to the attention of the person in charge along with a suggestion for a solution Chef in the last six deliveries Ive done I was late five times most often due to a late start when the food wasnt ready for loading into the van on time. Not only would I like to have the push time moved up at least five minutes Id like to have one other person designated to help load larger orders so it goes faster. Is this something we can discuss? I think we could appear a lot more professional on the delivery end if we did.While it may not be your fault that youre late or the food has a problem the complaints arent about you as a person theyre about your employer and you should listen apologize pass on the complaint and offer to have the person in charge get back to them to discuss a resolution.,LifeProTips,d3bwzsy,2,t5_2s5oq

7702719,0,t3_4ktii1,Throwaway accountSo my  year girlfriend cheated on me a lot during the course of the relationship and in the end I found out a couple months before we got married. I found the videos she had made with her lover. Hardcore stuff.So yeah. I wanted to explode. I went to a roller coaster of emotions that today still is hard to describe. I wanted to yell at her so many thing. I wanted to make her cry. I wanted her to feel like garbage but in the heat of the moment I just left the apartment we had so I could actually think instead of just feeling disgusted by everything I touched there.When I started thinking a random thought crossed my mind. I remember my dad told me when I was younger I was mid s when this happened about a friend of his that wanted to work in a suicide hotline to help other. That friend thought it was a sign here and start answering calls there but actually he had to go to a long training and in the training all he had to do was to say Ok alright and I understand. That is it. He had to be trained to fight any other instinct to say anything else. Months after the training and many calls answered that friend came to my dad and said how he was mesmerized by the fact that people would call back saying you saved my life. You told me exactly what to do and I did it and I turned my life around  when actually all they always say is ok alright and I understand.Back to the main story  so after leaving the place I had to come back a few times to sort out finances pick my things etc and the only thing I did was exactly that.I just sit there with a sad face with a very low and calm voice kept repeating those three words.Every time I went there she talked for HOURS explaining why she did why she wouldnt do it again how hard her life is everything from AtoZ she said and tried  and all I said was those three things and We wont get back.Fast forward to today. Everyone in her life and family knows she is worthless mutual friends cut relation with her she avoids all the places I frequent and every time the story comes up they just say the nicest things about me  how I could have destroyed her  even release the videos on the internet or have told everyone about it  but that I just did the right thing. I remember in the last day we talked she cried a lot and said because of what happened and what you did now I know how good you are and how I just tossed it away and that makes me feel even worse.Last month or so my dad had to go to her work place to talk to another person there and they sat together in the waiting room. He told me that she was completely out of place couldnt look him in the eye or say anything the whole time.Bonus fact a few weeks ago someone told me she was dating a married guy that now he left his wife and theyre leaving together.So yeah. Be  nice. Be thats impossible nice. Dont destroy your inner peace because of others.EDIT I just wanted to thank everyone for their comments. Im very thankful to Reddit in general. I follow many subs and they have helped me change my life around beyond this story. This community is full of great people and great histories and I just felt it was my turn to contribute. Thank you.

You cant change until you know what you want to change. Understand your underlying beliefs that support who you are and challenge them. Where did you get those beliefs from? Are they accurate? Or even real? Why do you still believe them? Create a plan to get what you want. List everything down even the seemingly impossible and TRY. The smallest change will snowball and give you more confidence to make progress.Remember that there are days when you fall but as long as you pick yourself up and try again you are consciously trying to make a change in your life.Each day is another gift to make things better than yesterday.

Looking inward and being honest with yourself facing what it is that has given outside forces undue access to your inner sanctity its an adversity that if overcome removes the need for superficial stopgap measures like dont listen to them or convince yourself of x. I would do this with a trained professional psychiatrist or psychologist or counselor of some sort. Face the demon find the cause understanding provides the complete solution in my experience. You came here looking for tips and tricks but what you really want with or without realizing it is to truly fix it and understanding is the only path to that.

Put all your money into the center stone and have it mount into a solitaire. After you give it to her explain that you would like her to pick out a mounting for it. And three months salary is not absurd. She wears this ring everyday and is the one that has to look at it. Price should fit in your budget. Whatever price range you pick compare that amount to other things you would buy. If a  is way too much why would you would spend over  per year on cable or your cell phone plan.

7796435,0,t3_4m2hfv,It is not smart to constantly use anything that relies on being balanced while it is in an unbalanced state like a fan or washing machine.  With that said I have fixed fans from making noise by applying a light oil to the part of the fan that bolts to the ceiling.  Most fans swivel in case your ceiling is on a slant it looks like a ball that sits in a hole in the mount.  The fans may be off balance a little and that ball moving in the mount starts to make a sound like knocking which is just dry plastic moving on dry plastic.  I squirt a little oil on a paper towel then wipe the area while moving the fan a little so that oil gets on the inside as well.  It doesnt really matter what oil though I thought nothing of using motorcycle chain lube which the old lady didnt like the smell.

7895930,0,t1_d43916w,It took me a long time to recognize some of the negative things I carried over from my childhood but being overly emotional is definitely one of them. I said this in a comment to someone else but I really do think that its likely a mix of nature versus nurture. It seems to me like there is a good chance that there is some genetic predisposition to extreme emotional responses in the women in my family. I also know though that the way my parents raised me any disagreement with their strict rules and restrictions was considered disrespect and I was punished for speaking my mind absolutely contributed to this issue for me. Im trying to unlearn all of these patterns that have been with me for almost all of my life. So yeah I think theres a lot of truth to wait you say. And understanding the root cause is one of the first steps to fixing it. ,LifeProTips,d43kqnc,1,t5_2s5oq

He was disconnected from the Borg Collective so he began to regain his sense of self.  He was later given the name Hugh by Geordi.  The great dilemma is whether to implant a virus in Hugh that would bring down the entire Borg Race or allow Hugh to return the to Borg as an individual and hope that it would awaken the other Borg and they would start to be more individual.    So there was a virus that could have destroyed the Borg but Capt Picard felt the moral thing to do was to simply return Hugh to the Borg without implanting the virus as he likened it to Genocide of an entire race. ,LifeProTips,d453ecu,57,t5_2s5oq

Or in my favourite case if the topic of their conversation was something I happen to know about I begin by humbly stating I know a little about the topic and i enjoy it this guides the topic and is what to me triggers the long deep conversations such as philosophy and politics or music and art I used to be very shy and never speak to people that much.Now I see parties as such great opportunities to apply these few rules and I have lots of fun engaging others.

Knocking someone unconscious while youre in deep water trying to save them and keep them from killing you is no easy feat. Its also hard to swim with someone who is unconscious while trying to not drown yourself. Most people who are panicking in water will relax rather quickly once they realize help has arrived. I work for a river rescue unit and have taken part in several rescues and recoveries. I cannot stress enough the importance of calling professional help for a water rescue situation. Many well intentioned untrained people find themselves in need of professional help because they got themselves into a situation that they were untrained and unprepared to be involved in. People overestimate their swimming ability underestimate the power of moving water underestimate how exhausting it is to rescue someone. I have seen would be rescuers die trying to do something they had no training to do. Bottom line please do not attempt a water rescue unless there is absolutely no other option and if you choose to do so only do so if you have a floatation device that you can strap to yourself like a PFD. ,LifeProTips,d4aw2aa,1,t5_2s5oq

Commercial ovena especially wood fired dont have this problem at all. The goal generally especially here is to have a crust that is cooked just rightcrispy on the outside but not dry on the inside with the cheese having just melted.This is why Chicago pies are backwards. The sauce is on top because the cheese would burn to a crisp by the time the crust finished cooking.Its really the thickness of the crust not the diameter that matters.

I too think it would be in their best interest for them to research where they go but for them to hear horror stories about how awful other donors were treated and this thread is FULL of horror stories seriously its just the cherry on top for them to avoid donating altogether.     I too am VERY thankful and amazed by medical technology. I feel very blessed every month that thanks to  people giving blood I get to continue to live. As recent as  years ago I would have caught pneumonia and died or at least had a very painful elongated daily process of trying to live. Had this treatment existed back in the early s either of the boys in the bubble David Vetter and Ted DeVita likely would have lived into adulthood amp had full lives. The blood product medication I take is related to the treatment both of these boys would have used to be able to live. It makes me look at my mortality in the face each month I have to do my infusions. Im not trying to guilt anyone into giving blood but what I have learned from having this defect and being exposed to others that also have it has been very disheartening.     Ive run on long enough here but want to thank you again for your donations. I also REALLY appreciate you NOT donating when you have a coldflu.

8003883,0,t1_d4ffuwa,Guess you missed the thread about this about a week ago but it was essentially asking Australians about how they felt about the gun ban in their country and how it compares to America. Most said the same thing I did its just not feasible here. We have way more crime in general in Australia there was little gun crime to begin with the number of deaths with firearms didnt go down much at all with the ban either and people were ACTUALLY willing to give up their guns in America that wont be the case.

Our brains have adapted to look for changes its why our eyes are attracted to movement. When your eyes are not focused on the thing you want to see in the dark your brain is actually working harder to interpret the information surrounding what you are looking at and its trying to find subtle changes. Its similar to the reason that when playing a FPS and you are hiding in a room with two doors waiting for that  son of a bitch to come in you put your sight in the middle between the two doors and dont focus on either door you let your peripheral do that work your reflexes will take over and you will be Much quicker on the draw whenever campyMcDoucheface comes in.,LifeProTips,d4m92km,1,t5_2s5oq

Id get right up under the nest enclose the nest in the bags pinch it off where it attached to the branch and use the pruners to cut the branch. Then Id bring the bag of pissed off wasps back to the shop throw it in a big garbage can fill it with water poke a hole in the bag and jam the lid on to drown the bastards. ,LifeProTips,d4p0vec,36,t5_2s5oq

Text them seldomly dont reply to their texts right away but eventually reply. This shows them you have a life which you may or may not have but youre still interested enough to text them just not right away. If they call miss the call every once in a while then text them and say youre a bit busy at the moment. Be energetic but not overly indulgent. The key is to slowly let them know you like them then eventually youll start to open up once you know that they really like you too.

8118880,0,t1_d4se3pc,I am in a decently new relationship  months and we adore each other and we have had a couple minor arguments about this. I was a hardcore gamer forced by my job other responsibilitieshobbies and this new relationship that I consider myself more of a casual gamer now but I still play every chance I get. I play RPGs so to make any dent in the game I need considerable time to sit and play. explaining this to her was hard and still is sometimes. but I have explained to her that I being accustomed to being alone need my me time and want to be alone to do whatever I want usually gaming or catching up on my shows on Netflix. this works as long as you make an effort to make time for her. we got into a pretty bad argument about me time and she told me that she understands me wanting alone time and playing my games as a source of relaxation but she likes being with me as her source of relaxation and comfort. I realized I needed to compromise to fit both of our needs because that is what she is doing for me when I am having me time and she wants to hangout. We are still working it out to get a comfortable balance but I can say its really about communication and planning. tell her you have a play date i like to make it sound adorable or cute online with some friends or for RPGs before I start to play it I tell her about my excitement and some details that goes over her head but she knows Im genuinely excited to play and wont give me a lot grief when I want to spend the night playing my game. she generally doesnt care for my games but I still invite her to hang at my place while I play games to try and blend the two i would love if she would ask about different aspects of the game as I play but for the most part theyre still  seperate aspects of my life girlfriend and games but she still likes being around me even when I do play my games. my advise is to be patient if she doesnt play more likely than not she thinks playing video games means your not doing anything and you have time to hangout. Be truthful and communicate not going to lie I was self conscious about explaining my desire to play video games a lot. I knew she didnt understand that its like a good book you cant put down or a show you cant help but binge watch. once I was able to convey that it was way more understandable to her.

So its not like I was unfamiliar with them.  And Ive heard that they are supposedly do work as a deterrent that criminals are less likely to escalate violence past what they originally planned.  But I just know of too many stories of robberies or breakins gone wrong.  A couple of guys broke into a drug house near where I lived not expecting anyone home.  Guy was home and armed shoot out resulted one of their neighbors got caught by a stray bullet.  The two guys that tried to come in got away but the dealer was arrested.A delivery driver I used to be aquainted with started carrying a gun with him for personal protection.

Dogs cool off by panting and using that to circulate cool air through their body. Shaving the hair can cause the skin to get infected irritated cause sunburns and can affect the hair growing back to its previous length and texture. A dogs hair offers them protection from the elements. If you want to cool off your dog leave out a block of ice in their water bowl so the water stays cold all day make sure to leave them in a room with either air conditioning or well circulated air leave out frozen treats and brush them. Brushing will help with overheating. Ive had several huskies over the years and they have done just fine with the summer heat.

I think the idea is that men see it as a dominance play when you face them headon and that forces them to either respond in kind or back down. So to avoid the power play altogether they simply stand side by side. However this swaps when its something like a boss yelling at a subordinate or people going into a tough business negotiation  The dominance play is intentional and is used to remind the subordinate where their place is.However those same men will have no issues talking with a woman facetoface because it isnt as threatening.,LifeProTips,d54se5y,1,t5_2s5oq

8231942,0,t3_4s26fz,The way I did it was to think about the future  In the short term immediate I dont give a damn what random strangers think of me because there is a  chance I will never see them again. In the moderate term I dont give a damn about what acquaintancescoworkersschool mates think of me because I will only know them for at most a couple of years. Then I will never see them again. In the long term the only person whose opinion matters are my friends and my loved ones. Everyone else is insignificant. They will come and go throughout my life and I do my best to get along but if they dont like me they can get bent.I suffered from depression for all of high school so I know how it feels to feel isolated alone. Scared to go after what I wanted because I was afraid of rejection. Eventually I just quit giving a damn. I started living my life for me not for others. The people who enjoyed my company after that became my new friends and everyone else just became obstacles in the way of my happiness. Do not let peoples judgments affect how you feel about yourself. People who judge you are not your friends so their opinions dont matter. Here is the biggest piece of advice I can give you  every time you feel compelled to think or say a negative thought try your damndest to turn it around to find something positive in it... This sucks BUT at least theres THAT Selfpity will just make you pitiful  I know this firsthand. And stop hanging around negative people  cut everyone who is negative out of your life. I know that is easier said than done but as someone suffering from depression it is far too easy for you to fall into a trap of feeding off others negativity which inevitably leads to pityparties.  Also I am guessing you are still in high school? Remember this shit is TEMPORARY. There is a very very good chance that once you graduate you will not see ANY of these people ever again. Everyone goes their separate ways spreading out across the country to find jobs or go to college. Everyones fortunes change after high school. Popular kids are suddenly nobodies and nobodies can become popular and respected.

Unless its something I bought that Im planning to cook up or eat the same day I got groceries.     For fruitveggies unless Im buying it for a specific recipe Ill often get it washedcut upready to eat right when I get home.    Obviously this doesnt apply to every piece of produce. But something like watermelon can be cut up and kept in a bowl in the fridge so its ready to eat whenever I want a piece.

It makes the nondrinker extremely uncomfortable and puts them on the defensive which in turn puts the asker on the defensive.  Say you dont like the smelltaste you will get told about alcoholic drinks that taste good.  If you are medically unable but otherwise want to it will make the person feel guilty that they are drinking when you cant.

8371662,0,t3_4u95km,in normal conversation it definitely wants to be under  minutes. also if he conversation starts going in a different direction you dont really want to keep dragging it back to the same thing. Still it could kind of meander off but as long as youre aware of the point you were trying to make then its probably still relevant enough where you could still be like but anyway yadda yadda yadda conclusion hahaha or whatever.so be mindful of the pointpunchlines or the facts of the story that are relevant. if I think of a really relevant story in conversation I start it off with sort of a so the other day this was happening... and then in a few sentences I build the scene and then get to the point. my main gist here is that it can be a performance of sorts it can be a joke it can be serious BUT it has to be authentic and If its a conversational context were talking about then theres that give and take. sometimes I even bore myself and at that point why am I even talking? really paying attention to other people in conversation listening more than talking most of the time and waiting for the right moments is super important. if its a long story you have to keep everyone engaged with twists and jokes.in the context of a Storycorp or This American Life or something its totally different. They have the story planned out fleshed out and right in front of them. And these stories are like  minutes. If you want people to listen to you recount your life then maybe you want to get in on Storycorps or something. really its not that hard if you have a story and send it in. but my best advice for this style of storytelling is write and get it out that way. In conversation I usually just want to keep the girls laughing you know? anyway I know writing helps me a lot sometimes so thats probably my best tip to offer.,LifeProTips,d5o0ah4,1,t5_2s5oq

I get a lot of I feel like I was just starting to come down with something so I thought I should see the doctor so we can get a zpack before it gets worse. Thats not a good reason to waste money or health care resources. Maybe you need marriage counseling. Reasonable use for UC. Fairly low percentage of visits are for this complaint though. Most people are very unhappy with you just need fluids and rest. After all they paid  and the doctor didnt even write me a prescription for totally unnecessary antibiotics for my clearly very minor problem! Maybe youve had some issues in your life and maybe youre totally reasonable. Maybe all of your friends are totally reasonable and are good health care stewards. But You also have to understand that Ive seen thousands of UC patients and I know that they didnt need to come to urgent care or see any doc for that matter and it makes me sad that they could have spent that money on their kids or bills or any number of other things.

If they are comfortable with using an older edition than I couldnt care less if they bought the new textbook. In my class lectures cover the relevant book material which I also explain in the first class so if you pay attention you can get by without a book but I HIGHLY recommend at least getting the previous edition to have a resource to reference when necessary.Again this is something I cover day one. I cant imagine other professors not doing this if they didnt I would say its safe to assume you should get the textbook.,LifeProTips,d5vm88l,1,t5_2s5oq

You can use a service like NoMoRobo or on my cell phone I have Mr. Number that tries to keep a list of unacceptable numbers to block them ahead of time and lets you whitelist numbers that are okay or in your contact list. Mostly its your first world problem and you can do what you want  waste some time talking with them hang up right away use caller ID to not answer etc. Just remember the people at the other end of the phone know theyre doing a scam know its illegal may hate what theyre doing but cant find another job and theyre not going to put you on a do not call list because as soon as you ask theyre just going to hang up and move along and may even flag you to get more calls out of spite.

I played shitty punk power chords for years as a kid and then worked my ass off  hours of guitar practice a day during a recording degree to become a pretty good fingerstyle acoustic guitarist with a solid understanding of theory.

Im not saying youre straight up wrong but i can guarantee that there would be some portion of people that get in way over their heads before they realize it. Nobody plans on becoming am addict til that first week they use too much and it either becomes drugs or basically the flu.

What does this do maybe crack the shell. but actually what will happen is that the hard boiled egg inside will shrink. let it sit in the ice water for a few minutes to have it set.Then you can peel it... how? With Science. Simply add a tiny bit of water to a round Tupperware container. put the egg and then shake the container in a rotating manner. so that the egg is swirling around inside the containing. Due to the shell being brittle and the egg inside has been set. they will separate completely and cleanly. And now you know how to do this...

C because sometimes it snows on grass or a certain virus can turn grass white.See I over think things and I find it very difficult in reading to move onto a new question.

8594702,0,t3_4xbvwd,I got a  on the English section of the ACT and what really helped me was categorizing questions in my head. There are categories that they test everytime commas colloquial usage idioms verbose language parallel structure etc. I suggest studying those categories and doing  former ACT tests on crackact.com and then going back and recording what types of questions you miss. Create a record of wrongs and the next time around only do the questions you miss.This works well with the math section of the ACT. If you know what youre struggling with its much easier to fix that than just blindly doing practice questions. On the science sections do the comparing scientists aka the long ass passages last. Finish all the graph type questions first. Reading complete the passages  as in complete the last passage first then the first passage third second. Reasoning behind it is the last requires no skill just searching for the direct quoteinfo from passage. The nd passage requires the most interpretation. TLDR Create a record of wrongs and when you practice practice in one sitting to simulate a testing environment. For science especially if you really dont know it take a guess and move on but circle the number if you can go back because youre already on a time crunch.PM me if you have any other questions  best wishes ,LifeProTips,d6fxg1f,1,t5_2s5oq

8622590,0,t1_d6jdgc7,Well one big tip is that you should ALWAYS travel in the off season for the country youre going to. Its always cheaper and there will be much fewer tourists. Plus you may see things that you wouldnt if you went when all the other tourists go. Like certain events or holidaysAlso seek out the lesser known areas of tourism. For example in france Paris is neat and iconic but its smoggy and loud compared to a place like Dijon. There are many hidden jewels in the countryside that few tourists know of.For places to travel Europe is a pretty standard location. But Western Europe Germany France etc has become swarmed by tourists and migrants. Making travel and enjoyment harder and lines longer for everything.Eastern Europe Croatia Serbia Georgia are starting to become much more developed and have just as much history as other European countries and have much fewer tourists that would choke up and crowd everything.The Baltic States in northern Europe Lithuania Latvia Estonia are cheap and are nice places overall.

And obviously the writers of these articles are not making the case for chewing gum during an interview.However using this evidence we might be able to conclude that chewing gum immediately PRIOR to an interview may have some benefit to relax the applicant improve their ability to respond to questions and quite possibly freshen up their breath. The data may suggest us to believe this but we certainly cant prove it given the data at hand. So we make some deductions and apply to real life.You have pointed out what I believe to be one of the biggest flaws of science in the general population today. Science is a process of thought not a content of material. And someone might think these articles would suggest chew gum all the time and youll be the next Elon Musk. And places like CNN love to take articles like this and post a clickbait article that says just that where the researchers dont mean that at all.Those are just a couple of brief sidepoints.

8674319,0,t1_d6pqnu4,Thanks a lot this explanation helped me understand a couple of details I had not yet grasped about things I have been doing which werent completely spoton yet.Previously based on this video I had understood that if you wanted a nice resonant voice you had to talk the same way as when you hum and that you had to project your voice toward your mask masque? but until now my humming had been concentrated on the back of my mouth near my throat not all the way forward mainly because it hadnt clicked for me how to make the connection to focus the sound there and with this exercise I got it.Another thing I had learned before from The Voice Lady was to figuratively send your words downwards toward the floor of your mouth when you speak instead of upwards to avoid nasality. This had the secondary effect of what I now understand as raising the soft palate. I hadnt quite identified just what happened inside my mouth when I did that but now I get it it raises the soft palate. I just felt like it created more space for the voice to resonate lika a cave. This is more accurate.So now this is what I think you need if you want a nice resonant deep voice Make lots of space for the voice to resonate in by breathing with your diaphragm and raising your soft palate. Use your voice the way you would hum focusing it forwards. Avoid nasality by sending the voice downwards toward the floor of your mouth not upwards.Is there anything else you can think of that I might be missing? I know my voice doesnt sound as great as I would like yet. Id appreciate any more tips.,LifeProTips,d6pwupg,8,t5_2s5oq

8717524,0,t3_4zdm6o,For me negativity has always been a symptom not a core issue. If you are sick caughing is only a result of being sick you dont caugh for no reason. By that logic you need to handle the main issue. So what is the main issue?Now this is hard for me to put in words. Its so easy to tell that this is all about confidence but Ive been where you are and I know that this means nothing to you. Even worse I used to get upset when I heard the word confidence. What you really need is a set of things to do that will when you actually do these things give you a different perspective in life. Lets talk about being yourself. Here is an experiment I want you to do. Sit alone in a room and imagine you have nothing and no one to rely on. No one to be dependent on. You have no google to find answers. You have no comfort food or comfort video games or whatever you like. You have no one to make you lunch. You have no one to wash your clothes. No one to do everything youre responsible about. Try your best not to avoid this moment. At this point its just you. This is the feeling of being yourself. Because all you have at this point is  yourself. This feeling might be scary if its the first time youre feeling it. But trust me this is the place from where you build confidence.You are responsible for a lot of things in your life and that includes your hapiness. You are responsible for it and blaming it on someone else is not being yourself. It will not get you confidence to pursue hapiness. Get back to being just you. You need to take control.Think about why you are being negative. Are you feeling unhappy with your life? But are other people to blame for it? Do they need to take care about you or is it your job? Be yourself.Now think about why you are unhappy? What is it that you so want and need to do that will make you happy? You see you are an individual that needs to take care of every aspect of your life. No one is gonna do it for you.Again strip away any dependencies and be yourself. Now take a pen and a piece of paper and write down whats on your mind. What needs to be done? Write it down and then simply start doing it. Things you wrote down on that piece of paper will come from your authenticity and doing this stuff will give you a sense of control in your life. It will give you a feeling of confidence. A feeling of control and acomplishment. After doing things you write down on paper for a while things become easy and theres a general sense of abundance. And in the place of control its easy to just decide to think positively. To share that happiness too. Put yourself first. However you may try you will never be as close to anyone else as you will be to yourself. Its a sad but relieving thought. Take time to appreciate yourself. Like I showed you in the experiment  without any dependencies addictions and aviodances. You see I found that negativity is a result of general passiveness in life. To get your life on track you need to start doing stuff that come from your self. Hope this makes sense and helps you.,LifeProTips,d6vbvpw,3,t5_2s5oq

8752071,0,t1_d6zl7vn,Please dont confuse me with the toxins crowd. Dont get me started on that.The problem is that factors can throw your thirst mechanism out. It is way too simplistic to assume that your thirst feeling is perfectly attuned to the needs of your body. It is also too simplistic to assume that you are acting correctly on the impulses that your body is telling you. Thyroid problems and medication can throw your thirst mechanism out of whack for example so its definitely possible. Most people eat a lot more salt than our savannah ancestors did. Most people have fuckedup sleep patterns sleep is crucial to a number of metabolic processes do you claim to fully understand the effect of toolittle sleep on kidney function for example? Then theres the simple question of personal response. Do you drink when you feel mild thirst or not until you feel severe thirst? Thats likely to be affected by social conditions.I drink  litres of water a day in the office plus coffee plus a beer at home. I used to not drink the water. Thirst simply didnt tell me to. When I started consistently drinking water I noticed huge improvements in my energy and in the quality and length of sleep. Yes thats anecdotal but its empirical.

8756185,1,t1_d704p4c,Dont do this. As someone with PTSD Ive looked up using weed as a sleep aid and it does not mix well with many mental illnesses. It can work in the short term and have some nasty effects in the long term. Preventing you from potentially getting better and the second you stop things could be worse than they were before.Nevermind the potential for addiction.There was this one medication my therapist recommended to me a few years ago I think it had something to do with blood pressure but as a side effect it removed nightmares? Side effects seemed nasty though so I didnt go that route. I think one of them was induced schizophrenia or schizophrenic hallucinations.Id investigate adrenal suppressants. The problem is getting your hands on them as I dont think you can just get them for anything. Youd need to consult a doctor on this one and do your own research on potential side effects risks etc. Keeping in mind this is not a standard method as of yet Ive heard that theyre researching adrenal suppressants in PTSD patients and how it affects dreaming and reprocessing trauma in a controlled setting with a psychiatrist. Perhaps theyve come a ways since I last looked it up so maybe the research is more solid now  something you should again discuss with your doctor.,LifeProTips,d706jk1,-2,t5_2s5oq

8761566,0,t1_d70u05b,The way I rationalized it was similar to dieting. Most people who commit to hardcore diets with no cheat days inevitably fail and I feel that teaching yourself to fear alcohol is a pretty asinine approach because then youre stuck spending the rest of your life never drinking ever again because if you so much as sip a drink youve broken your sobriety which can lead to that thought process where you rationalize well Ive broken my sobriety I may as well drink. Maybe I am hard headed but its that hard headedness that gave me the ability to demonstrate the self control I needed to pull myself out of a spiral. I acknowledge that I have no one but myself to blame for my previous drinking issues and dont like it when people play the victim when it comes to substance problems. In the case of this post when people drink and become intoxicated they are naturally inquisitive when someone in the group isnt drinking. Its foolish to expect drunk people to not behave like drunk people just so the person that isnt drinking can feel more comfortable.

8784920,0,t3_50cjbo,Scientific writing like all kinds of writing has some basic objective structure aims methodology etc and a lot of subjective rules about how the detail should be done sentence structure language choices etc. The best place to start is to look for a guide on scientific writing for your specific area of study. The goal is different for biology vs astrophysics and you need to understand the intricacies of your area.Once you have a sense of the requirements in your area speak with your mentors and coauthors and ask them to explain to you how they apply each of those guidelines or if they dont and how they make that choice.The reality is that most scientific writers are not following a detailed set of rules they learned from someone else they have just developed their own internal rules based on their own experience. Often they will give conflicting feedback often there is no clear right or wrong way to do things. If you are working with the same people consistently then the goal should be to understand what their expectations are and how they would know you had met them. Once you have got clarity on that you should need fewer and fewer iterations to get it to their standard. If they are still asking you to make significant changes keep asking questions until you understand what it is they are trying to get you to do at a structural level rather than a situational level i.e. how could this principle be applied generally rather than just this once.Heres the thing about scientific writing if your methodology is clear well thought out and valid and your results and statistical analysis are the same there is not a great deal more to it. The goal is to make sure that another person in your field your peer reviewers is able to understand clearly how you went about your science and why your results should be trusted. You need to lay out any potential issues with your study proactively e.g. the sample size was limited by geographical factors and the results may not be valid for other populations etc. If you can do these things then a peer reviewer is likely to let it through into the journal. That is essentially the goal of scientific writing  to get published so that other scientists can become aware of your research. If your mentors and co authors are asking you to make numerous changes other than more clearly expressing these things it is likely more to do with their personal style than the actual requirements of the paper. Get them to explain it  they probably havent given it much thought so you will either get less feedback because they will realise it is superfluous to the goal or you will get greater clarity and be able to anticipate the feedback better next time.Best of luck!,LifeProTips,d73sd4s,2,t5_2s5oq

Or where I disagreed that black people commit a disproportionate amount of violent crimes. I just said that police are subject to unconscious bias which they are because theyre human beings who deal with the worst of our society every day. I didnt generalize...generalizing is suggesting that I deserve to be pulled over or detained more often because black people kill each other. Your argument is  correct...there are a lot of problems in the black community that have to do with crime violence drugs economics and education. However its  invalid as justification for disparate policing. When were talking about fairness and you thunder in with well...what about crime! you sound like that guy who cant wait to point out that black people deserve what they get. Which is charming...

9016228,0,t3_53o1kh,So...standard spam mail ok.Step one is recognizing what actual job offers look like and what job spam looks like.The email you got has nothing to do with you.  Its just junk spam sent to a hundred thousand people with some hope of response for some crap job waiting which probably has some up front buy in.Also as you apply for real jobs upload your resume and start letting these automated systems and recruiter firms work for you you start getting a sea of new job postings and piles of recruiters point you to new job opportunities half way across the country.  The job postings are automated.  The recruiters are only using your body to fill a hole and dont particularly care about you.  Your resume was a reasonable keyword match so you got an email yay.  Meanwhile the job is in bumfuck nowhere for some terrible company that cant hold onto staff because they suck so much.There are three good ways to get a job.One go to a desirable companys website and look in their careers section for job openings.  Apply to anything you are capable of doing.Two go onto job boards like Indeed CareerBuilder or Monster and upload your resume these are big resume banks employers and staffingrecruiting firms use search for and apply for jobs and upload your resume to the sub resume banks that are used in many of these job applications.Three find staffingrecruiter firms that specialize in your career field and work with a recruiter to find job opportunities.Understand that blind emails are spam.  Job boards can automatically generate useful emails for job opportunities via keyword and keep you abreast of new listings.  Staffingrecruiting agencies are a good option for getting others to do the busy work for you.  Its their job.  However they are filling employment holes for commision so...tread cautiously.  However they can sometimes get your foot in the door easier than you can yourself.  Some companies strictly go through staffing firms only so in some cases this is the only way in.,LifeProTips,d7vlzf4,1,t5_2s5oq

Wouldnt wanna get shot because you didnt narrate your every fucking slothspeed movement!I mean Jesus if I a citizen were as jumpy as cops are allowed to get away with being Id have shot so many people by now! Your honor I was in the elevator with him when he reached quickly into his pocket! I had to defend myself! How was I supposed to know it was his cell phone that he was reaching for and not a loaded Glock that he was going to kill me with??? I had to err on the side of caution because its my life before his you know??Whether or not I give attitude raise my voice etc. should not affect whether or not I get a ticket. Let alone giving me more problems. Youre pretty much saying Its illegal to have certain emotions in certain contexts. Oh I feel uncomfortable about that unmarked car? Let me exercise my rights...oh but if I do theyll throw the book at me instead of giving me a warning? Bullshit!God its like were talking about how to act around wild animals.

9025705,0,t3_53ts1u,These threads seem to come around every couple months now and each one is more tone deaf than the previous.  This list of steps only shines a huge spotlight on the problem with the officer mentality that they should be treated as anything other than a public servant simply because they have the authority that is derived from carrying a loaded weapon.  I sum my policy up thusly If Im walking across the street in a crosswalk with a walk sign I legally have the right of way.  If a semi comes barreling through a red light at the intersection going  mph Im dead.  Sure I had right of way but in that moment it would have made more sense for me to yield my rights to save my own life.Same thing goes with cops.  I have tons of rights I can try to exercise with them but I never know when one of them is going to pop off a few rounds in my chest just because it suits them in that moment.  So I tend to yield any right I have to whatever they are saying at the moment. Cops are or used to be shown as heroic individuals who always do the right thing.  Some are. The reality is a good portion of cops are your dipshit high school buddy who failed out of every other venture and landed with a badge. ,LifeProTips,d7wqxy9,2,t5_2s5oq

If the country has private ownership of the means of production it is not socialist. Period.Now do socialists acknowledge capitalist development as part of the longterm progression of a society toward socialism? Yea. A lot of them would say that it is necessary to go through a capitalist economic phase before socialism can be achieved but that doesnt mean that capitalism and socialism can realistically exist together. Can socialism have a market exchange of goods? I say yes but its debatable. There are ideas about market socialism but theyre often derided within socialist circles.

Fast forward  years to my student teaching. Im placed in a public school exactly like the one I grew up in. I came home bawling every day. I hated it and was scared to the point of puking every day that I had chosen this as my lifes profession. After graduation I decided I would never teach and took a retail job instead. My fiancee was so sweet and supportive through all of this that when he saw an ad for a history teacher at a private school and suggested I try it out I did even though I swore Id never teach again. Well thank God he did because teaching at that school is everything I ever dreamed. Still love history still love telling crazy stories to my students still love everything about my job  years on. I never plan on leaving my school. No standardized tests. AP classes out the wazoo. Ability to be picky about the kids we accept and keep at the school. I adore my job. TLDR Public school teaching made me toss aside the degree I loved private school teaching let me do what I love. Lesson Choose something you love but make sure that something has variations.

9050862,0,t3_5456jy,Part the One I graduated high school with OK grades. Nothing fantastic but above average. One thing I could do easily was write. So off to college and I majored in Communications with a focus on journalism. College was a fun time but my grades werent too hot. After five years I made it out with a degree in Communications Journalism and I moved out to the West Coast and landed a bottomoftherung job at a small financial publication. It gave me a peek into the publishing world and I got to see a handful of great journalists and a lot of mediocre journalists. I also got to see the power of advertising which essentially allowed the paper to exist. Right about that time the dotcom boom was in full force and I got a job at a nowdefunct search engine. That experience was a blast. Thanks to that job I learned that I liked the idea of writing code. I started teaching myself HTML and CSS. Shortly after that I was exposed to PHP and MySQL and loved that. Right before the bubble burst I decided I wanted to strike out on my own  do my own thing so I left the company. About two weeks later my friends at the company were laid off with  months severance as the downsizing hit. I liked to think that at least I left with my dignity. After that I tried drumming up business for solo web development. This was back in  so it was a different time. I had one prospect I cleary remember who completely uncovered that I didnt really know jack shit. I knew it in theory Id read the books but when he asked me to map out a simple code structure I stood there at a white board drawing a blank. It revealed I didnt actually have even the most basic knowledge. After that nightmare scenario I decided Id never let that happen again. I dove back into the books and started actually building things to show off. I built a custom CMS in PHPMySQL for a nonprofit that was barebones but worked. This was around  or . Anyone looking at that code now would laugh. Theres libraries that can put that type of thing together in a matter of minutes as compared to the weeks I spent putting it all together. Its still one of my favorite accomplishments though. After that I started making a meager living. I joined forces with some friends and we had a few successful clients. And that is what consisted of a lot of my midtolate twenties. I was doing some work mostly what I was interested in and learning some valuable lessons like be careful starting companies with friends. Most of all though I felt like I was just floating. I was trying things to see what would stick. Some stuff I really liked  like writing code and building sites and other stuff I was OK at freelance writing which paid a small sum for not a lot of work. After several years of what felt like bumming around I decided to move to the East Coast with my girlfriend at the time who had been accepted into a medical school residency program. After moving and settling in I was able to secure a few small web projects that paid the bills. I started bartending and waiting tables on weekends for extra money. At this time that I came across a graduate program that piqued my interests. It encompassed a lot of curriculum around technology its impact on society and was asking some of the pressing questions of the time like those around data aggregation privacy digital language impact of technology on children. I thought This is the place for me! Unfortunately the school responded back to my application saying We may be the place for you but youre not the student for us! I was crushed. My undergrad grades had come back to haunt me. So I made a plan I could take classes at the school as a type of dropin student. I spoke to the director of the program and told her how much I wanted to be there. She sat down and essentially said Lets make a deal which was if I took classes over the next semester including a required one with her and got all As she would consider my application towards the end of the school year. There were no guarantees but shed give me a second chance. It was one of the best opportunities I ever had. I busted my ass and had a great time doing it. There was a huge difference between undergrad where I was just struggling to get through while partying as much as possible and graduate school where I was truly interested in the materials and sought to get as much as possible out of the experience. I applied during the  lateadmissions period and was accepted into the program. I started the program fulltime and was putting everything into it. I took out student loans to cover the costs stopped doing the web development work but picked up more bartending shifts. And that was my life for about a year. During this time I had an incredible class that focused on the intersection of code and the legal system. So this was at the time after Napster had fallen Kazaa had spun up and then dispersed and the music and movie industry execs were freaking out You wouldnt download a car would you!?!?  hell yes  if I had the means I would download a car!. Anyway this class delved into how the legal system was forever trying to catch up with the code developers wrote and the implications that occurred as a result. Being the genius that I am I thought  what better way to be able to properly address the discussion around technology and policy than to go to law school? After finishing grad school I found a steady job as a web developer for a nonprofit and set my eyes on law school. I studied my ass off and took the LSAT but my first time applying I didnt get in anywhere. So I licked my wounds signed up for a prep course and studied my ass even offier. My scores improved and I got into my top choice. Keep in mind my expectations changed drastically after being rejected. What was my fifth or sixth choice first time around became my top choice the second time applying. After you spend  per application and you get rejection letter after rejection letter you realize youre not the special snowflake that ivyleague schools are gunning for. At that point you make piece with the fact that midtier schools can be just as rewarding. What do you call the guy who finished at the bottom of his class from the lowest tier medical school?... DoctorDue to the fact that I was working full time as a web dev I started eveningparttime law school. This was a completely different experience than those who go fulltime but can be just as rewarding. When I started law school I was about  years old. I was trying to advance in my career through my work as well as through my studies and I had put in place enough good habits that I knew how to make the most of my time. Looking back at some of the kids who had jumped into law school right after college there were those who knew how to manage their time and those who didnt. This was probably the most valuable realization I had... I was so happy to be going through law school at  instead of . At  I had no idea what I liked what I wanted to do or what really revved my engine. But after bumming around for about seven years I knew what it meant to be inspired by something. So my days were structured. I worked during the days and went to class in the evenings. I was fortunate to have a work environment that wasnt too stressful and allowed me to study so long as all of my pertinent work was completed. The first year was as grueling as they say it is but then after that it was just a lot of work but not so much fear. Towards the end I was taking class that fit my interests and focused my mind.

9051126,0,t3_5456jy,i dont know about anybody else but i mucked around until i found a class that i didnt totally hate. i was a writing major first then an art major and though i loved writing and drawing in my free time i despised doing assignments in those classes. it was like pulling teeth for some reason. then i switched to a visual effects major which i did really enjoy but during this i worked minimum wage and very rarely had money for things i needed so i also realized that i would prefer going into a field with more job security higher pay. last switch was to computer science and im almost done with my degree now. computer science is the BEST. i cant say theres been a class in CS ive not enjoyed  well maybe networking because fuck protocols  but tbh its a lot easier to learn and work when you enjoy what youre in. this entire process has taken me  years and ill only just have my associates degree soon lol. dont fret. you got time and youre allowed to take it at your own pace.,LifeProTips,d7zsuve,1,t5_2s5oq

Spent the last few years severly depressed and recluse but have built myself back up this year. Despite being muuuch happier I felt like i had lost a lot of friends due to what I was going through and didnt have people with which to go do stuff that happy me wants to do. People who wished me a happy birthday didnt have to but they did and that was enough of an ice breaker for me to roll the dice. Im sure i wont be bestest buds with everyone who posted to my wall but if I get to add  or  new names to my outside of the internet  friends roster then that will be a positive thing. Ill see in a few months who has staying power and who was just being receptive to convo because it was my birthday. ,LifeProTips,d7ztw24,1,t5_2s5oq

So when it comes time to edit its way easier with audio since you can drop the music track so you dont get a copystrike and adjust the volumes of the others so you can actually hear whats going on. Friends being loud when something important happens in game? Mute the fuckers. You sneeze while playing? Cut it out. Gunfire in game so loud you cant hear a funny banter between you and your friends? Make it quieter.Shadowplay is nice for spurofthemoment stuff but it sucks ass that it has no microphone options. Even with my microphone gain turned all the way up in the Windows mixer it sounds like a whisper and is also jammed on the same audio track as the game so you cant easily tweak it.If you want to get into better videoaudio editing Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum  goes on sale for  during a Steam sale and is a featurerestricted version of Vegas Pro.,LifeProTips,d8ru9za,44,t5_2s5oq

9313530,0,t3_57zii9,Just to throw something out that you may not have considered but if the professor ends up giving them a lesser grade than yours or if he outright tells them that you brought it to his attention that they didnt do all the work they will definitely tell this story to other people.Someone I know is still suffering from the effects of doing something similar. The other people told their story first and made themselves look as victims and he got a reputation as a snitch. Now whenever his name is mentioned someone will usually bring this incident up.Now there are important projects and conferences so if this is something where you know for a fact that your career hinges on it then do as you see fit.But if youre doing this more on principle and rest assured Ive been here and I feel your frustration consider what benefits you will get other than satisfaction and what you stand to lose. I just got out of a graduate school environment this stuff still happens but usually these are much smaller communities than people realize people tell stories and its usually the frustrating assholes that have others do all the work that also are really good at this sort of verbal manipulation. Whether you ignore this on act on it is up to you but just think about what I wrote because Ive seen stuff like this really blow up in peoples faces.

9364939,0,t1_d8xt7t2,Presentation is a very different beast than cooking.  And for me different things will work for different foods.  In your example the sauteed cabbage will look bland just spread out on a plate but put it in a small bowl and sprinkle a few green leaves on top or a thin slice of tomato and you have made the pop of color the focus without affecting the taste.  In addition to color try using symmetry or a repeating pattern like a piece of cheese cut into  cubes cut diagonally to get  triangles and then just use them to frame or separate some vegetables.  Try what works for you and you will be surprised what you can do with simple colors patterns and a little bit of flair.  Best of luck!,LifeProTips,d932n5b,1,t5_2s5oq

The pizza tastes almost identical to the night it was delivered except a little crispier and it never dries out completely in the freezer like it does in the refrigerator. ,LifeProTips,d95jhcf,1,t5_2s5oq

9416063,0,t3_59lqby,I was an avid backpacker cyclist and runner.  I slowed down when we had our kids in my mid s it was just hard to find the time to work out.  At  while trying to get back into shape and loose the dad bod I discovered it was almost too late.  I started running again and my hands would go numb after about  minutes.  I tried to push through it for weeks thinking I was just out of shape.  I was not I had a  blockage of my LAD artery also referred to as the widow maker.  I should have been dead.  I had not led an unhealthy lifestyle but my mother smoked a carton a week around me until I left for college I had forgotten about our family history of heart disease and I ate a typical midwestern american diet i.e. meat and cheese.  Lying in a hospital bed waiting for my stent to be installed I realized I was almost that guy that we all know someone who knows the guy who has a sudden unexpected heart attack leaving his partner and kids alone and in tears. I realized how my life was going to have to change if I wanted to live all my favorite foods were gone. No more excuses not to exersize. I pitied myself so much thought I could never live with the change.  Do you know how fucking hard it is to eat at an average american restaurant when you have to avoid both meat and cheese?   months later Ive lost  pounds my blood pressure is normal my cholesterol levels are tiny I run miles every week and am in the best shape of my life.  My depression has largely faded and other than the fear that I now know how I will likely die life has improved.  The specifics of what I did was likely highly personal to me but if I have one pro tip it would be...Focus on what you can control my diet and my exercise and not on what you cant how my body reacted to either.  It may still not be enough but youll be happier being active than passive.  And if I can sneak in a second one...Focus on the people around you the people who need you.  I could die tomorrow and it wont change who I am or what I have accomplished.  We are all needed by someone or something and you living for as long as possible will make their lives better even if its just another week.I stumbled upon this thread Im sorry if this is not specific enough or deep enough. It spoke to me and I wanted to help someone else if possible. ,LifeProTips,d99jv48,4,t5_2s5oq

They are less attached to the things and can help be your voice of reason.Make three piles keep trash sell.Dont keep stuff you havent seen or used in the past x months ? ? and get rid of duplicate stuff.It might help you for certain items if you give them to someone you know to keep them in the family. Stuffed animals other stuff like that that you just keep around might make someone you care about happy! Pass along that emotional attachment!Some furniture items that take up space like extra drawers might not be necessary once you sift through your stuff. Make room for other cooler stuff or just keep the place less cluttered. That frying pan which is all scratched up? Throw it away! Keep only nice stuff! I did this once with my sisters closet why do you need  pairs of black slacks which look almost identically alike?! She got rid of most them.Papers I have  huge boxes of papers Ive been moving around with me for the past  years. I could probably throw it away since I dont even miss or remember whats in them.

9480148,0,t3_5amkqv,Agree with this for the most part.  And theres actually quite a bit of evidence to back up the perspective.  The idea is to try to habitualize certain processes that you know are the best way to go if you can.Then as they say you rely on the discipline of following your regimen of whatever it might be.  ...In other words willpower is limited and motivation is fleeting but discipline amp preparation will be there when times get tough.Id only say that we might want to recognize some limits on the effectiveness of going too far on this concept.  ...For instance we always hearreadsee stories of these CEOs or executives or highachieving whomevers who become so slavishlydevoted to pure execution that they then lack perspective for big picture vision or for creative adjustment or for selfawareness etc.For example think of Mark Zuckerberg who goes so far as to have his uniform for working at Facebook of just jeans and grey Tshirts.  ...He says it spares him the extra time to pick out an outfit in the morning and so on.Or think of any number of a range of socalled high performance military types that have been writtenup in the past few years.  You can cite Generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal whom we were told all get up at  a.m. and go for  mile runs on  hrs. of sleep and in McChrstals case only eats once per day.  ...Well did any of those things actually get them to think outside the box? or to question authority etc.?  ...Its worth considering.So just saying that discipline and routine are good but there are probably a range of good points to look for balance too.,LifeProTips,d9hms5l,3,t5_2s5oq

Similarly as im bad at having photographs taken of me I said no when she asked if I wanted to have a photograph with her at her birthday night out a few months before the festival. As a result I have no photographs with her.The only good thing to have come out of that is that now I take a photo with a friend even if I think Im ugly in the photograph. I say yes when they invite me to an event like a wedding or a gig or a night out. I make the most of my friends and enjoy their existence.

You feel sometimes when you hear analysts and knowledgeable people talking about Iran that they the group fear so much about the survival of the regime because deep down its not a legitimate regime it doesnt represent the will of the people its kind of morphed into kind of a military theocracy. And therefore an argument is made constantly on the hardline side of the Iranian Government that were not going to give anything up and in fact were going to provoke an attack because then we will be in power for as long as anyone can imagine.If anything she wants to avoid war so as not to legitimize the regime.ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTLearn to vet your damn sources. Since your first source is utter shit I dont feel compelled to watch any of your other videos.Also I hate to break it to you but Trump loves the idea of using the nuclear he loves the idea of torture he loves the idea of killing women and children Vote Trump War Criminal.gtgt Meanwhile god forbid women be equal to men. gtThats not the point Im making. I know what your point was however your source did not back up your conjecture.gtMy personal opinion is no one should be drafted at all. But regardless the point is suddenly Obama and Hillary are pushing for drafting women.Oh you mean that bill that has been talked about for over a decade and that now passed with the support of both parties in the Senate and that more Americans are in favor of than against?I mean this for the sake of your mental health do not get your news from YouTube it is ridiculously  cancerous.,LifeProTips,d9rofvm,1,t5_2s5oq

It doesnt matter what the cost of the pasta is thats not whats determining whats wrong or right here. I already explained and asked you to stop reacting off kneejerk instincts and instead think logically. And you just refuse to. This is about the fact that because you have left the restaurant you can no longer get any more pasta. You only have this one irreplaceable serving. Case  you wake up the next day and eat it. Case  you give it to a homeless person.Tell me why case  caused a loss of business or revenue for The Olive Garden when there was absolutely no difference for them in the outcomes of either case?Meanwhile INSIDE the restaurant giving a portion to a nonpaying customer means that you have another extra servings worth of space in your own stomach which is then wrongly cheating the system.All this time you still cant even address what Ive been saying.

Yeah that type of behavior really pissed me off.Im such a jaded smart ass when it comes to the homeless population in my city because there are TONS of them and nearly all choose to be there and act like they are owed something for willingly contributing nothing to any part of society.I once walked past a guy holding a sign saying he was hungry. I was going to the grocery store to buy some fruit and sandwiches so I bought an extra apple orange and sandwich to give to him. When I handed them to him he said I dont want your food got any money? which shocked me because his sign said he was hungry.I had previously seen him trying to buy weed off some teenagers and prior to that trying to intimidate old women into giving him money to the point that someone from the bar I was drinking at roughed him up a little so I said I wasnt gonna give him money so he could try to score more weed. He started swearing at me and threw the sandwich on the ground and tried to throw the fruit at me so I took an apple out of my own grocery bag threw it at him and hit him square between the eyes.

We actively create most of our emotions by the way we use our faces breathing movement position and what we think about but theyre such habits we dont often realize that.

I felt so alone in the world in those first few months.  My friends didnt know how to talk to me so I avoided them huge mistake.  Allow yourself to talk to those closest about whats happening.  Try to find a therapist who you can see regularly during this.  There are so many emotions that wont have any rhyme or reason that make you feel like youre losing your mind.  Talking to a therapist is the only way I got through. I remember leaving my house I grew up in too.  I thought it would be the hardest but I was so sick of sadness I was ready to move on and leave it behind.  Time goes on and you find a new normal and you will make happy memories again as time heals.   years on I see my parents happy and I dont miss the old times anymore.It will be okay so many hugs.  ,LifeProTips,dalqorl,2,t5_2s5oq

9827709,0,t3_5fxmbr,Iv been using Pinterest for picking recipes it works quite niceI use three boards . Foods to Try . Weekly Menu .  Tried It Loved It!Recipes I want to try go on Board .  Foods that need to be shopped for this week go on board . Foods Ive made and liked go on Board .  Each week  I clear off last weeks meals from Weekly menu deleted or move to Tried It Loved It.  And by now my Tried It Loved It board has a whole bunch of recipes Im familiar with on it so thats usually my next place to look for stuff I want to cook the next week. If I want something new Ill browse the food section.  So now Im writing dont judge on a blank Google Calendar I printed writing out the meals for each night and moving the recipes into the Weekly Menu Board.  Once the week is planned out Im done with picking recipes and I go through the weekly menu board and grab the ingredients I need from each recipe and checking the sides veggies garlic bread etc  Ive written down to make my shopping list.  This lets me do one shopping trip a week and I go all the way across town to the cheap employeeowned place and nail it out there.  The next week  I go back thru the Weekly menu board to clear it out and start all over again.Just thought Id throw in my two cents.  Not plugging Pinterest at all I use it only for this but its nice because its a visual tool for selecting the food you eat.,LifeProTips,daoklpn,1,t5_2s5oq
9828945,0,t1_dajbzrs,Im not against an oil Pipeline being built at all. The oil is going to be pumped out of the ground and moved to wherever they want it regardless if a pipeline gets built. Pipelines are actually a lot safer than moving the oil by train and would reduce the possibility of a environmental disaster significantly.  All these oilhating hippies that are at the protest who probably used a car that uses gas to get there are using the Standing Rock Sioux tribe as way to push their own agenda. The real problem here is the pipeline was originally going through the Missouri rive above the city of Bismark The people in the city of Bismark then complained that their water source was at risk and had the company move it down further south. Now that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is having the same concerns as the city of Bismark the Dakota Access company is refusing to negotiate and has continued to drill. Its this treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe what is most concerning for me while the city of Bismark is allowed to move the pipeline when they fear for their water the Sioux Nation is being treated as second class citizens and are being given the burden of a possible disaster. ,LifeProTips,daoqemz,3,t5_2s5oq

9902579,0,t1_day942r,A lot of CSRs begin experiencing frustration not with the customers but with the policies of the company they work for which render them unable to help customers.Ive worked and managed good projects and bad projects and am currently lucky to be managing one of the better ones. The worst projects for the reps are always without a doubt the ones where they cant go offscript or the ones were they basically just pick up the phone to tell the customer they cant do whatevers being asked of them and then take abuse for a few minutes before the call ends. You have to remember youre not just being paid to sit in a chair and get yelled at by customers. Youre also going to have to worry about meeting metrics getting yelled at by your supervisor when not meeting those metrics and ensuring that quality guidelines are followed on every call and then getting yelled at by QA when that doesnt happen. In shitty projects everyone from supervisors to QA to trainers are frustrated and that frustration rolls all the way down to you. Shit when I think about it there are times when I would have preferred to stay on a call with an abusive customer than have to get off to meet with QA or get coached. Youre sitting in a cubicle for  hours or more making shit for cash and enforcing internal anticonsumer policies that you dont agree with all the while struggling to keep up with everincreasing performance requirements and generating experience that will only ever help you get a job in a different building where youll do it all over again. Although hopefully next time youll get to climb a little higher up the corporate ladder.Its for sure not the most stressful job but you have to remember that unlike being a lawyer or a brain surgeon most people in call centers are high school educated and just trying to make a living theyre often not made entirely aware of the kind of pressure theyll be underor its sugarcoated significantly. A lot of them are good people with families they are trying to support and they work in an environment where theyre easily replaceable and often have to live with not only the pressure that they may be fired for underperforming but also that their entire project may be shut down because its being moved to the Philippines or the Dominican Republic. Its not like that everywhere though. Like I said there are good projects where reps are treated like actual human beings and receive good bonuses time off and a lot of benefits. Those are rare however.

9928378,0,t3_5hmuwj,This post means a lot to me. I use to be really overweight and self conscious about it. I lost lbs and now I do a lot of powerlifting and absolutely love the gym. That being said I have a soft heart for people pushing themselves when theyre overweight. I have seen this kid coming the gym I use recently whose pretty overweight glasses neckbeard and just  on a warpath to better himself. Let me tell you something Reddit anyone..... anyone can do curls in a gym and be confident about it but doing agility drills outside the gyms window while youre overweight and uncoordinated takes heart! I would occasionally watch this kid in awe to see his desire that we all have to be in better shape and as I glanced back once I could see two guys obviously laughing at him as if he was some sort of sideshow. Im  and lbs now and I could have easily went up to these bros and called them out but thats not me. Now Im mad I felt like they were laughing at me laughing at my past and I wanted to beat them to death with a ballpeen hammer but I calmed down. Eventually the big kid came in and was doing cable flies and I saw my opportunity. I walked up to him and said Hey man I just wanted to tell you that I see you in here a lot killing it you really motivate me and if you ever need a spot you feel free to come get me. He just smiled like a goofball and said thanks man. I see him ever so often and hes still killing. But now I wave and he always lights up a big smile.

9986040,0,t1_db96795,But I grow my beard because I cant shave the . times per day on average required to keep it comfortable brushing my teeth is a habit I constantly fall in and out of doing regularly and showering is only done daily for sure because even if Im home all day my hair ends up causing me in a state of discomfort that showering is required to relieve I get the same sense of discomfort that stops issues with brushing teeth and trimming beard from going on too long after about three days and a month respectively but showering is the only one I do frequently enough to never lead to issues.These things lead to an active sense of relief when they are done like going to bed at a reasonable hour. Exercise has never provided that sense of relief if done in any quantity that could lead to change.

I think it is not only what we think our life should be it can also be due to low expectations. If you do not ask what do I want? and instead ask what is it reasonable to expect? and your expectations are lower than your needs then youre going to be miserable and youre also going to let bad things happen to you  because you expect bad things to happen and you believe youre just supposed to deal with it because you believe thats what everybody else is doing  its just that theyre doing it better than you. Some people are unhappy because their expectations are too high some people are unhappy because their expectations are too low.My argument was that not everybody is wanting something they dont have some unhappy people believe they should be happy with what they have and then berate themselves for not being. Those people fail to recognise that life has more to offer them than they think is reasonable or realistic and that they dont need to try to adapt to bad situations because thats just life and itll be the same anywhere I go.

As an example Californias  GS law covered only emergency care which did not include rescue. I can think of at least two cases in which care crash victims successfully sued those who pulled them from the wreckage but injured them in the process in California. Its not a matter of victim lived therefore no damages. The argument can be made that the bystanders intervention caused harm despite the outcome  ie the victim lived after CPR but the number of broken ribs was higher than what would have occurred had the bystander been properly trained.

But I could be wrong on the exact distance. If these conditions arent met and there is fire the fire crews will go right past your house and work towards preventing a house whos following the rules. With stacks of firewood and other assorted shit all around your house it takes too many resources to try and fight those. Edit I should clarify this is for houses where wild fire is a risk.

I also am going through a change in my life where i need to decide what i am doing either going to uni or just sticking it out and just finding better jobs than the one i have now. I feel like i have a huge weight on my chest and shoulders all the time of everyday and its effecting my life in so many negative ways. My main hobby was video games but i dont even want to play them anymore i feel like i need to just sit staring and thinking of what could have been. This is also impacting my social life as i just decline most invitations to go outside or to parties. Couple that with my lingering social anxiety and the fact that im probably to scared to make the jump to uni i just dont know what to do. It might sound petty and like i am exaggerating and i understand that because there are so many people who have it a lot worse than me. But that still doesnt change how i personally feel about myself.However with all this in mind i have never once consider suicide. The way i see it is at least something however small is better than absolutely nothing. The best analogy i can think of would be If you had the choice between no cake for the rest of your life or eat some horrible cake now with the possibility of having lots of nice cake later in life what would you choose?substitute cake with something you like it was an example. That might sound corny but its the best way i can describe my thought processAnyway i never really post anything on Reddit but given my state of mind recently i just find this cathartic to finally get something however small off my chest as i never really open up to anyone.,LifeProTips,dbtx0et,2,t5_2s5oq

10148424,0,t1_dbubest,Some people just cant understand that if theyre useless to society  its not the societys fault but theirs. The way things usually are if you feel your existence is unimportant then it probably is. Nobody is going to value your life more than yourself.I had  friends who at different points in lives both commit suicide. One of them was also a really popular figure in school and had a lot of friends. Three years after their deaths after all facebook posts quiet down nobody even remembers their names anymore let alone who they were.IMO suicide is such a pathetic thought to entertain yourself with anyone who really finds sense in it should just go ahead with it and kill themselves.,LifeProTips,dbucbvd,-1,t5_2s5oq

If I learn from my mistakes the sting of the embarrassment kind of weakens over time. Eventually I still have those memories but whenever it bubbles up I just think gosh I wont be doing that again anytime soon.If I didnt learn anything from it and theres no correcting it then...

I guess if people can afford it go for it but to someone like me I was just like why are you wasting this much money? I think its a status or convenience thing.

You should sleep at least a little bit so that you can actually retain what you studied and have some energy and brain power for the test. Three hours of sleep is the bare minimum Id settle for while at least six hours is solid. I would make an outline of the most important stuff to study then add stuff that would be good study if you have time then Id slog away at it until whenever it is that I know I need to crash to get my  hours and Id wake up early enough to have at least  minutes to review what I studied the night before. ,LifeProTips,dc062tr,1,t5_2s5oq

You cant tell me its rude to ask you guys ever plan on having kids? Or you planning on getting married Im TERRIBLY sorry I tried to ask you a question to get to know you better as a personcouple. Again if they dont want to talk about it theyll probably say so if not theyll just say yes or no or even not right now.

10230873,0,t1_dc3m876,If you dont have a dog bred for snow anything below freezing can be too cold depending on the dog.  Bigger dogs can handle cold better than little dogs. A thicker coat or just a stockier build helps conserve heat. A Chihuahuas cold tolerance is a lot different than a Labradors. If you take your dog out and they are hunched over shivering lifting their paws up and down or trying to get back inside it is too cold. Start off with short walks and determine what your dogs tolerance is and take them back inside ASAP once they show signs of being too cold. Never take your dog walking below  degrees especially on concrete or asphalt. This can actually tear up a dogs paws pretty good. Winter booties can be useful in the city as certain ice melts can irritate dogs paws. However petroleum jelly works too. Just make sure to clean their pads super well when you get home so the dont lick up all that junk that has collected on their feet. Jackets also help if your dog doesnt handle the cold well.

Unless your friends carry some serious weight in a company just their recommendation wont be enough to land you any other job.Thats not to say that networking isnt important it is. But calling in favors isnt networking. Networking is getting yourself in front of the right people and showing them your relevant interests and skills. By making that impression even if they dont land you a job immediately you make yourself a possiblity in their mind when the times comes that they actually need someone.Dont like your job?

When I was in my teen years I was frequently calling the police on my verbally and somewhat physically abusive brother who just loved waving his gun around saying hes good and threatening to use it. Whilst my parents were enabling him and letting him go on these rampages endangering myself and his  year old son at the timw.Because a  year old was always the one calling they rightfully had their suspicions. But they would make me repeat the story over and over again. Meanwhile hes over here spouting off just being dangerous in general. And they would even claim that I was lying about the guns when my mother said otherwise they said they could file a false police report because my mother lied to keep her precious violent son from jailtime.I was eventually calling every month and they knew the adress and stopped doubting my claims because they witnessed it a lot.

10323255,0,t1_dcduf30,No. Its the parents fault for not teaching them selfcontrol if they are playing for that long. If theyre not doing homework its because they either dont understand it they cant find suitable conditions to do it in or they just dont want to.If its the latter yes punish them. BUT if you take away all of their motivation for actually wanting to do anything... they will just not care. Take take take. Then you cant take anything more and the problem isnt fixed.Lets use me as an example. On my rd grade I used to play the shit out of The Sims the original one. Pretty much played it for the whole year. I never did any homework at home I would do it during recess or heck even in class. I wouldnt even study because I would learn my shit in class.  Id only slightly study after lunch on sundays and even then it was because I wasnt forced to and it became kind of a ritual.Ended up having teachers request my tests back after grading to use them as the test used when doing a correctin in class.Animals are animals whether humans cats or dogs. And childrens behaviour is extremely close to unintelligent animals exactly because what makes us responsible adults isnt yet established for them.If you just kick a dog after he messes up one day hell bite you or hell just want to avoid you. Keep punishing children without actually helping them understand why and HOW they should do things and youre just creating mindless idiots who are uncapable of thinking for themselves,LifeProTips,dce74qi,1,t5_2s5oq

DO keep your head back normally but look to the right and maybe let the driver know if she doesnt mind the help the outlook of traffic coming from that side especially if she is making a left across multiple lanes of traffic from a T intersection.

10357755,0,t3_5obxnn,One thing that helps a bit is stopping myself and just asking myself whether the thoughts Im having are rational. I found myself this morning thinking something so ridiculous that a schizophrenic would be impressed something that depended upon five assumptions that I had zero evidence to support That person A told person B something that person B talked to the SO that the SO believed person B that the SO didnt ask for my side of the story but took person Bs account at face value and that the SO is now blowing me off as a result of this.I found myself thinking all of these paranoid thoughts simply because I havent received a response to a text message after several hours. Its insane and I hate that my mind will work this way if I dont stop myself and snap myself out of it. My default position is to assume the worst.Stopping myself going through each and every assumption that Im making and reminding myself that this is just paranoid insecure conjecture seems to help. Reminding myself that Ive thought exactly this way many times in the past and I turned out to be completely full of shit and everything turned out fine helps.Any other tips?,LifeProTips,dci41mz,3,t5_2s5oq

Ideally you only contribute to what your employer is willing to match beyond the match you should contribute to a Roth IRA. Reason being a k to the match is the best vehicle bc your employer is GIVING you money. A k is pretax grows tax free but is taxed upon distribution after age   earliest you can withdraw without penalty and you HAVE to start taking money at   called required minimum distributions. A Roth IRA on the other hand is post tax just regular income taxes grows tax free and is entirely tax free upon distribution after age   with no RMD. So youre getting taxed on the acorn instead of the oak tree with a Roth. A k youre being taxed on the oak tree. Summed up contribute to a k to the employers match beyond that you should invest in a Roth.,LifeProTips,dcnei9p,24,t5_2s5oq

10440875,0,t1_dcrih6t,Thanks for a followup! Im not vehemently opposed to Windows  and it doesnt seem like you lumped me in with that group but it just didnt seem like an upgrade that I would want.One of the main reasons I would want Windows  would be for its exclusive compatibility with Windows Apps but it seemed like it was a bit more locked down than previous Windows Operating Systems. It apparently has for the most part and unsurprisingly more compatibility with drivers and a lions share of programs but I kept on hearing of issues with some mostly older and no longer supported programs that I like to use so I decided against it.Ill admit that I also took issue with the fact that there were many early reports of spywaretype information sharing in early builds but I guess that has become much less of an issue. It was a factor in my decision but I guess it shouldnt have been one.As for SSD support its too bad that things are more hidden but Im sure thats because there are plenty of users out there who would accidentally delete system files without knowing what theyre doing and then complain that it was Microsofts fault. However being able to have a clear set of easily accessible options within the Device Manager to optimize for SSDs seems like it would be ideal.,LifeProTips,dcrjul1,1,t5_2s5oq

10449195,0,t3_5plhet,Im just gonna write this here to get it off my chest. This girl I met at the seaside when I was a kid  years ago. We werent super close back then but we had some cool moments and I guess we could say we were friends. Then last year she randomly pms me on fb and honestly we have quite a weird conversation. I had before checked her profile now and then and I knew see she was having some problems in life she looked quite awful drugs definitely I did chat with her and we had this weird but cool conversation. Hard to explain but when she pmed me It felt as tho she was pming just random people not really expecting a conversation but I did my best to engage and we just talked about random stuff shared some music ... But then she got a bit weird and wanted to meet up with me like reaaaaly wanted to see me ... thing is shes from a diff city like h drive and I couldnt really get my moms car that late ... and honestly I didnt really want to meet up ... she was just acting weird in my eyes back then and I didnt want to get involved.She pmed me like once or twice after that but not much happened.A few weeks later I see a post from her sister or someone on her fb and honestly this shit just hit me hard. I was absolutely clueless back then fuckwjfnvsncbshe had blue hair now every time I see a person with blue hair it reminds me of her and I dont see it going away anytime soon.I know its not my fault and that there were probably people in her life that could have done more. But still what if I went to see her? She seemed lonely maybe thats all that she needed maybe she just needed someone to listen to be there for her.Bottom line I had a chance to save a life. As small as it may have been and as much as it wasnt my fault and I couldnt have known ... there was still a chance and I failed. These could very well be the only time I had a chance like this. I thought Id feel better but I dont. Should probably not think about this.,LifeProTips,dcsiegb,1,t5_2s5oq

I didnt even thing about it until we moved and my spouse had to start doing more of the cooking.  I had to start leaving times with the instructions on when to start cooking items.  I noticed that things just werent getting done at the same time.One thing that you may want to try is to read over instructions thoroughly before starting pulling out all of the ingredients you need and have everything prepped before you start.

10552035,0,t1_dd3y3je,It depends on the culture of your company which you kind of addressed without authority but didnt fully. Hopefully you run your company correctly where your employees feel that they have the right to decide whats right to take care of a customer. Give them the right to give a little extra when they deem it necessary. Messed up an order? Free dessert on the house. Sorry! Celebration dinner? Here let me get you guys started with an appetizer on us. Those little things can go a long way in building loyal customers and ultimately make the company more money. But if you dont run your business like that and your employee is going on their own accord well theyre wrong and should be disciplined accordingly. Thats just my two cents . ,LifeProTips,dd46wxl,17,t5_2s5oq

As a server and bartender I can honestly say leaving a nice tip is insurmountably better than a verbal praise either directly to the management or to myself. Although its nice to receive it directly its usually people who use the verbal tip as a justification not to tip well.Whereas verbally praising me to my manager will in turn get me almost nothing. Youre just telling my boss that Im doing my job which is to give great service and my boss sees it as a reflection on hisher great managerial skills.All that aside I take care of you IF you take care of me.

10555160,0,t3_5r2r7r,So I used to work at a local mini golf golf range and go kart place.Toward the end of summer the manager that was a total bitch wed be dead. Like  hours in between customers and wouldnt let us listen to music read be on our phones nothing. Total stickler for the rules while she herself would sit in her office  feet away and do whatever the hell she wanted and leave for  hour lunches my coworkers and I loved it.The owner actually didnt care if we were doing anything nonwork related. Hes an older gentleman of at least  and he smokes expensive cigars in his office down the hall for  hours goes for lunch comes back at like pm. Hes awesome.Well days I worked without Bitchy McSaggyTits I would give away free buckets for the range free games of mini golf and would bump up the time on the carts from  minutes to like  for people that were nice.Well this group or family of like  comes in. We get through about  or so and the next person steps up and says they forgot their wallet or whatever and would run out to their car fairly packed at the arcade next door were talking a  minute round trip minimum and I told him I didnt mind and he could just play with his family. Next thing I know he raises his voice probably really hyped and just blurts out DUDE YOURE LETTING ME PLAY FOR FREE?! YOU ARE AMAZING I turn white.I expect SaggyTits to walk out but she doesnt. Not until all of them leave. That  dollar game of golf of which they return the stick and the ball is in a compartment at the end of the course cost me my job.I was fucking livid.  dollars shouldnt cost someone a job. So I guess what im trying to say is SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN SOMEONE GIVES YOU SOMETHING FOR FREE AT A BUSINESS. THEY CAN GET IN TROUBLE.,LifeProTips,dd4joez,1,t5_2s5oq

10562792,0,t3_5r855i,gt Photoshop finds what is different in the photos and simply removes itActually thats not quite what happens which sounds a bit too much like magic. It merely selects the median pixel out of the  in the stack. So for this to work as intended you have to assume that for each area where there are some people some of the time theres more frequently than not nobody at each point otherwise the mean pixels are going to be for somebody. So this trick wont work in exceedingly densewithpeople areas or areas where people stay there for quite a while without moving out of the way. Taking more frames can help here though in changing light challenges start to compound.If the median approach doesnt work and leaves artefacts you can also manually paint in with masks empty i.e. no people parts of each frame as long as each area is empty in at least one framethis will generally give a better result overall avoiding other possible artefacts with other potentially moving things in the frame trees leaves reflections etc. but is a bit more work.You can do a safer job of capturing the scene by manually triggering shots instead of just using a timer observing each area of the scene and taking shots for each area as they become empty. This will ensure that you have empty information for the whole scene instead of relying on probabilitiescrossing your fingers that you got it.You can do nothing for areas where theres always somebody in the wayshort of trying to patch it up as convincingly as you can with clonestamping to recreate parts of the frame you never get to actually see in any one frame.,LifeProTips,dd5eu5w,31,t5_2s5oq

10571899,0,t1_dd5gmip,I read this somewhere on reddit so dont credit me but the analogy goes like thisImagine a brand new roll of paper towel. Now imagine each sheet represents a given amount of fat or weightlets say  pound. As you workout and diet diet even more important for weight loss you start shedding fatonly  sheet at a time. Imagine tearing a sheet from that brand new roll that is thick. That one sheet only covers a surface area of around  circumference of the roll in other words you wont notice any difference. Now imagine you stay consistent in your routine and youve lost  poundssheets. The roll you have now has a smaller circumference than when you first started. Now each sheet that is shed makes up  of the circumference do you see where this is going? Fast forward to having lost  pounds and each sheet actually wraps around nearly twice the roll. Even every  pound you lose at that point is a significant difference in your appearance. That little  pound you lost may not have made a visual difference in the beginning because it was being shed from a core mass that had a large surface area but once you reach a lower core mass each pound shed will be a lot more noticeable. To sum it up success can be visually seen exponentially. You will start slow but keep at it and I promise you that you and everyone else will see results.,LifeProTips,dd6epwh,1,t5_2s5oq
10572818,0,t1_dd6by4z,Basically you have to find other peoples playlists that fit your tastes. There are also featured playlists like released this week. You can use them to find music you like and then build your own playlists as well. I cant remember but I also thought they had radio station type things but they never played my kind of music. I didnt like Spotify because I can never build my own playlists.. its just hard for me to find music I like when I sit in front of a computer for some reason which is why I liked pandora. Also people listen to some weird things and sifting through playlists isnt what I enjoy doing.Then I found google play... its like the best of  both worlds. The stations dont suck and I can frequently find one that I can play through for hours without pressing skip. The price is fair and the family price shared with family can be even cheaper if split! The apps for Google play are built well and the selection is good as well. Not to mention with a Google play subscription you get youtube RED included which means no more advertisements on youtube videos ever. Their youtube red stuff for music is also great.Ill stop now. ,LifeProTips,dd6i4we,1,t5_2s5oq

10612471,0,t1_ddakeqo,Thanks for contributing to the topic at hand. s Unless this is an experiment to see how many people disagree with you while still listening to what you have to say? But if that is the case you might want to remove the first sentence. Starting out with a sweeping generalization isnt usually a good way to get people to open their hearts and minds to differing opinions. And maybe tone back on all the isms and buzzwords. It just makes whatever you are about to say less impactful because I automatically assume it is going to be a regurgitation of something Ive already read  times. This is all just my opinion. Everyone feel free to disagree.  Disclaimer I didnt vote Trump. I do browse and comment on TD. I generally dont think it is as bad as the rest of reddit makes it out to be.

10614277,0,t3_5rqrhy,Im not sure if this will get read since Im a little late to the party but I was completely housebound for about  years due to very crippling anxiety and agoraphobia with a bit of OCD. Now as I am typing this Im on break on my college campus studying something that I love. It was hard for a long time to get help and try to not beat myself up over being anxious. I used to be outgoing I had many many friends and acquaintances I played in a band we did live shows all that cool stuff. And then one day out of nowhere I just couldnt handle life anymore maybe life is not the right word and I was SCARED of everything. Being at the house alone i was  ish when it started eating food that MIGHT cause an allergic reaction that was completely blown out of proportion later on and i had never had any sort of reaction to anything food or otherwise. i ended up seeing a really good therapist that I think probably saved my life because I couldnt look forward in life I was just breathing not living. We did therapy for about  years maybe a little less. I got medicated I pushed myself harder every week to go out more even if it was just to drive to the supermarket. And eventually when I felt comfortable to drive to the college I am now I applied. Now Im here all is well some days Im just a tad anxious but it isnt full blown panic attacks anymore just mild discomfort. When those hit I just sit down on a bench and do breathing exercises. I guess I just wanted to share my experience with anyone who feels or has felt this way. Just relax and breathe. Anxiety wont be the end of you. You got this shit. ,LifeProTips,ddas604,1,t5_2s5oq

10725507,0,t3_5tciym,As someone who has drawn nearly my entire life I also advise to not be afraid to copy for practice and study purposes. This isnt a new learning technique  a lot of the old masters had apprentices who did the same. Some art techniques cannot just be outlined or shown even by a charming man with a soothing voice. You have to actually do them and its easiest to understand why youre doing it if youre not having to invent the context. I did this a lot to learn and try out different character line and coloring styles.A math example would be learning a new equation by going through some already written out and solved than trying to input your own numbers the first time. Interesting tidbit There is a theory that the Mona Lisa was actually a painting created specifically to teach an apprentice different coloring and shading techniques which the apprentice would attempt to copy exactly and thats the reason there were so many variations. The apprentice copy of the Mona Lisa still exists.      Edit Another tip is to try drawing upside down. This will be challenging of course and you will look quite silly. But by putting the object in a different perspective certain brain connections pertaining to object recognition will break and this will improve drawing technique. With enough practice your ability to break those connections without drawing upside down will happen naturally. The reason why its important to break the connections is that even as you attempt to copy from life and life only your preconceived idea of what an object is or looks like will alter the shape color and shading of the drawing. Breaking the object recognition will block these preconceptions. Thats the ELI version anyway someone with a brain science background could probably explain it better.   ,LifeProTips,ddm98fb,2,t5_2s5oq

10761224,0,t3_5tv8sb,oh my god fucking this.  Back in my freshman year of college I got into a pretty serious accident that landed me in alot of pain and sitting down for about  and a half months.  During that time I couldnt work out and was in such constant pain when I moved that eating became a chore had to walk to the dining hall.  As a result I started to lose alot of weight it also didnt help that I was already tall.  Going home was absolutely awful so many relatives told me I looked like skin and bones and that I needed to eat some cookies.  I didnt even know how to respond to these comments due to the fact that not many people knew about the injuries I sustained.  It was completely humiliating and one of the worst times ive felt about my body despite it being my lowest weight.  ,LifeProTips,ddpxvn1,1,t5_2s5oq

Lost eight pounds in under a month my gains  . This week I have  assignments  midterms  meetings Undergraduate project demo and presentation and have to deal with my ex girlfriends mother whom we had to evict last month for not paying  months in tent  in utilities. To top it all off she left the house in a mess garbage everywhere left dog shit and dried up dog urine all over the house stole my bike broke into our on property storage locker threw out our government letters that she claimed she didnt get and broke into our realtor lock to retrieve the new keys we made. We recently had to change the locks again  days ago. Then I have an important rewrite exam next Tuesday in a subject I absolutely suck in if I dont pass this exam I cant graduate. I literally am feeling so burned out and Im so stressed that Im on a  week script of Ritalin and resorted to calm my nerves with weed at night. My sleep pattern is am to am. All while practicing interview problems and applying for jobs I have to get a job by May because my parents just moved to Europe and Im the only on in North America. Im financing my tuition of yr from government student loans and misc jobs like freelance media editing and creation. I want to find a girl thats special but its hard when you have no girls in the program. I have tons of friends that a girls but its harder to find new girls that you would date. I constantly feel like I could fail out at any point Ive never thought I could pull off double all nighters this grind is fucking terrible. I wake up most days realizing there is hardly anything I look forward to that day its hard soldiering on its hard having to leave your bed to start your day  or not wanting to sleep so that tomorrow doesnt start. I remember when I was younger experiencing interests and hobbies with such a blissfully naive admiration. All I experience now is anhedonia everyone around me is suffering too  were all getting panic attacks together. We have to learn everything ourselves because the profs cant teach for shit. I got to .  of my lectures so does the majority. Were it not for my large network of really really great friends and most importantly if I didnt have such a loving mother I think I would have killed myself or dropped out a long time ago.

Theyve dealt with the aunt that wants to steal the show the cousins that wont stand still for pictures and so on. It wont fluster them like it would an amateur.

Im not a photographer myself but I have some friends who are. They are constantly going to conferences and shows taking classes and so on to improve their skills and nail down photo ideas that work.

Water tends to superheat when you boil it meaning its more prone to suddenly form large volatile bubbles instead of smaller controlled ones has to do with smaller bubbles losing to surface tension. This is why when you microwave water it comes out looking flat but may boil over at the slightest touch. Chemists typically place a couple small rocks called boiling chips to disturb the water allowing smaller bubbles to rise to the surface. A spoon may achieve the same thing and will have the illusion of boiling at a lower temperature but shouldnt change the boiling point at all. ,LifeProTips,dds3uip,9,t5_2s5oq

My rear flashers are amber so its nowhere near as aggressive as flashing brake lights but it gets the job done every time so far. This is a common occurrence on the two lane rural roads I use. In many states its illegal to drive with them on however theres an exception to their use if warning a trailing driver of an obstacle ahead.

Youre really not supposed to be hitting the brakes hard enough for it to slow you down anyway the whole point of flashing them is to give the implication that you are slowing down so they brake as well.

10850082,0,t1_ddylog8,As a person who is an emotional dumpster and like to vent myself. Say something into the air like today its a shit day and this dude at work made me feel bad when he said he had diarrhea and then proceeded to make me smell his asshole. Dont say things like oh my god i wish i was you today i had such a bad time and its so nice crying on your shoulder because i had to smell a asshole at work and please pity me because i am so sad angry and frustrated.Try to say it in a way that doesnt necessarily involve getting them involved in the problem or have to use energy and feelings to comfort you. Venting is getting rid of frustration and anger to feel better. It does not mean talk to person and expect them to feel for you. It sometimes helps adding sorry just had to vent. Or Im feeling better now that Im around you. And let it be when you are finished venting dont bring it back up unless its something that needs emotional support. IE Harassment or other abuse that you actually need help with. Venting is when you just need to get it out of your system but you dont really need help with the issue. Dumping your feelings is when it makes you sad and in turn makes them feel bad. Sadness is contageous and should be talked about but dont confuse it with venting. Because you will get used to venting and in turn not realize when you are dumping. Hope it makes sense my SO is bipolar so that is my source I have learned to cope but i need to be careful when im venting making sure i dont put pressure on her.

But I was so scared to pop it because I didnt want it to get infected. Now being a skincare specialist I can recognize what something is and I KNEW it wasnt herpes or anything I shouldnt touch. I dont have herpes or shouldnt be worried. But its safe to be sure I called my mom to ask her opinion on if I should pop it or go to a doctor. She laughed and told me that Im the specialist and should know the answer but she voted popping it. Lol. Long story short I popped it and it didnt get infected. And Im now scarless and okay! Haha.

10877936,0,t3_5va3mv,Im a  year old girl. I used to be fairly chubby   and  pounds around a size . I was only on the low end of overweight and I knew this but figured I just hated my body because Im insecure so no need to do anything about it.That is until  people in one week asked me if I was pregnant.  The first was a well off but very polite middle aged lady I was ringing up at the register. She asked me when Im due. Im like Im not. She just apologized and got really flustered she was blushing and immediately changed the subject. I was  never had kids and was on my period so I get a little extra stomach bloat that Im very self conscious about. I shrugged it off as the shirt I was wearing or my bad posture. She didnt seem like she was purposely trying to offend me so I got over it. Late s mom I was helping at work asked me the same thing later and I told her Im not pregnant she apologized and started awkwardly rambling about how some of us just carry it in the middle! and how her  year old daughter is just soooo skinny and always makes fun of her belly but its okay. I didnt eat for the rest of the day. The last one was my Uber driver. He asked me how far along I am and I said Im not pregnant. He laughed to himself and audibly muttered Oh my god I really thought you were pregnant! Genuine shock. Only driver Ive ever not given five stars to. Even after I TOLD him I was in fact not pregnant he didnt believe me and kept insisting I was that was the last straw. I went on a diet cut out alcohol entirely no fast food  net calories a day max. Gym  days a week and  crunches a day. After I dropped  pounds I stopped getting the pregnant comments and started getting compliments instead. Now Im  pounds and a size .And guess what? I still hate my body. I still wont wear a shirt I was wearing when someone asked that question to me long ago even though theyre all big on me now. I buy shirts in a M instead of a S because even though the S fits me better Im terrified for some reason people will notice my belly. My waist is  inches. I want it to be . I never cared before. Im not sure if I should thank the people who asked me those questions or resent them.They pushed me over the line and made me improve myself for which I am grateful. But I still hate my body because of it. I think I always will even if I ever do make it to my goal weight  lbs.  just picked an arbitrarily low number and went with it I hate my stomach that is always hungry and never quite flat. Im obsessed with it months and months later even though Im a healthy weight now. When I never cared before. All because a couple of people decided to be rude to me that one week. tldr Think before you speak.,LifeProTips,de1zcts,2,t5_2s5oq

10896318,0,t1_de3u2fa,You only need a small amount of water A lot less than it takes to grow the new lettuce that replaces it and the fridge is a step which does yield better results but is unnecessary. I also argue that there is so much lettuce waste in the world because most people do not make the effort to refresh them or do not know they can and instead throw them out and replace them. Farmers grow massive quantities knowing that most of the lettuce they sell will end up in landfill. markets keep buying them because people keep buying them. Simple supply and demand dictates that if you buy less the producer will produce less. The lowered production equals less water consumption less machinery running which utilises fossil fuels and less wastage at all levels from farm to table. Less wastage means less greenhouse gases released ,LifeProTips,de3vm87,2,t5_2s5oq

10980539,0,t1_decif89,The thing is when I hear Ive got other offers it automatically tells me whatever Im buying it for is more than your willing to settle for. I cant tell you how many times I give an offer and when its not accepted I get a call back within a week. I usually say something like add my phone number to your list in case the others are no longer interested. Then when they call I ask for a couple hundred less again. I havent actually done this with a car but other high priced used goods. Ive only owned seven cars in my life and adding them all together still falls under my annual salary. There is a point where kbb is essentially the price minus deductible value of a car. Im sceptical of someone willing to sell a car for less than that. Last car I sold the guy asked me why so cheap?

You dont have to go with the first one you find. For a landlord tenant issue every state I know of has a statute that provides for double or triple your deposit plus attorneys fees. Now it can vary by issue and state whether or not the provisions allowing that would apply but worth asking about. And its not likely theyd charge a consultation fee for an issue like that.

11024827,0,t1_degyith,Thats not really what OP is talking about though. Youre talking about a doctor taking on a very specific and complex surgery. This LPT is aimed at the common stuff. As a PT you get to know all the people that do a partial knee or a rotator cuff and you know who does the best work. Those doctors can crank out a thousand partial knees a day PTs see them all the time and absolutely know whose patients recover the fastest and whose are more prone to infection.     Also PTs arent that out of the loop. Doctors dont just send patients their way and say You gotta guess what happened to this person in not telling! Theyre fully aware if a surgery is normal or not as that will affect their schedule and treatment provided. In your wifes case they didnt send her to a PT and tell the PT it was a normal knee surgery and then the PT get confused on why it took so long to recover. Theyre fully in the know about the complexities and know its going to take a longer than average time to rehab.     Source GF is a PT and both her parents work in different hospitals.

11028136,0,t3_5xg28w,I used to tell myself that I was stupid and a failure and that Id never amount to anything. Every single time I made a non trivial fuck up. It kept me back from what I wanted and now Im  and in school because I stopped scolding myself for being a fuck up and started praising myself whenever I do something well.,LifeProTips,dei0isb,1,t5_2s5oq
11028310,0,t3_5xg28w,I find that scolding myself is a form of holding myself to a higher standard. For my daily faults it helps me to not get complacent thinking nobody else saw me so nothing actually happened I saw what happened and I should aspire to something better. For my big fuckups it keeps me from letting myself off the hook. Ive worked hard to make myself better than I was when I did something really bad. Its not something I will ever forget or should forget lest it happens again. That being said you should treat yourself how you would want others to treat you. Ive met many people who have treated me kindly encouraged me and fought for positive change in me. I try to scold myself in ways that will help make me a better person using what others have done to me that lift me up instead of putting me down. Be hard on yourself when you screw up but be proud when you accomplish something good. And dont allow yourself to get a big head after a long string of successes find ways to stay humble. Take on bigger challenges and dont be afraid of failing. Learning from failure is often more effective than learning from success.,LifeProTips,dei18be,1,t5_2s5oq

11037242,0,t3_5xk23p,I have epilepsy and only am conscious for about  seconds at the beginning then I pass out. Not sure how long it is until I wake up. A few times Ive had one in the shower and have no idea how long I was out just a busted eye or lip to remember the occasion. Anyway I was a teenager when I first started having seizures and those  seconds do make a difference. I can hear the panic in someones voice or the calm and it effects my level of fear. I obviously hate having seizures and used to be terrified of having one. Ill never forget once I started to have one and heard my dad say my name in a voice I never heard from him sheer panic. Another time he found me passed out in the closet and I heard him waking me up with a really depressing voice I hadnt had one in a while and we had just celebrated that having another meant I relapsed and it would be a tough week of seizures. Its not his fault he doesnt know this but I really just needed to hear more of a youre safe and everything is okay. Just knowing someone is there calm and isnt making a big deal of it makes a huge difference. The person that dealt with it the best was a guy I sat next to in english class once. I realized I was starting to have one while I couldnt turn to him or say anything I could see out of the corner of my eye he saw something was happening and tried to get my attention. Before I passed out I heard him say everything was okay. When I came to he had gotten the teacher and tried to make everyone leave the room. As teenagers they were assholes and curious so they didnt and I woke up with a  circle of about  kids around me. But that guy made me feel better about it because eI knew someone had my back. He was the son of a doctor and had dealt with some shit in his life so Im guessing he recognized what was happening and then just dealt with stressful situations well. So if youre out there thanks Kevin. You made one of the typically worst days of my life not so terrible.,LifeProTips,dej1vsl,7,t5_2s5oq

Or say that it was gonna be  special. Then they would look at their statement and they charged . Then a salon. Then something else. Then they sold it to someone but they scammed him in that process.

A lot of reptile owners will weigh their animals weekly to make sure theyre not losong weight.  grams this week.  the next. Its logged and stored away in a notebook. And multiply this by the number of snakes or lizards. Not to mention the feeding schedules. Every Tuesday this needs to be done. Every Wednesday this does. And so on.

11108484,0,t1_der4map,I never claimed to have never had a PMS related fight what I said is that Ive never seen the kind of totally bonkers irrationality guys talk about.Cutting and pasting my own comment Theres a specific fight that I think of as my personal worst period related fight. The guy was very stressed out about stuff that had nothing to do with me and he kept snapping at me. To the point that other people were noticing. It had been going on all day but I waited until we were alone at his house before saying Look I know that youre really stressed out right now but I am tired of being snapped at. It isnt fair for you to take you stress out on me. Rather than acknowledging what was going on he rolled his eyes and walked away. And I should have let him walk away. But because hormones had made my fuse short I followed him and we got in a massive exhausting fight. My hormones  made that fight worse but I wasnt creating a problem out of thin air. And it  would not have happened if he was capable of saying Youre right Ive been a jerk today and Im sorry about that. Neither of us were at our best. But making it about my hormones negates what he did to create the situation and it puts all the responsibility on me to manage everyones emotions.That isnt a story about an awful fight happening because of PMS.

11118176,0,t3_5yn47p,ubflaminio pointed out that youre paying more for the year but I have another comment.If you want to reduce your overall interest for loans like mortgages then  using OPs k    you have two options and you should do both if you can afford it. The general rule is to pay extra and you get more bang for your buck when the loan is new especially when the extra payment is large.For instance you will pay . in interest if you pay regularly. However if you add mo youll pay k less in interest. But I said that its better to pay more early on and pay larger amount.For instance if you pay just  extra in the first month of the loan your total paymentinterest will be reduced by .. What about if you do this for ONLY the th payment of ? .. st payment  years? ..As you can see the MORE you can pay extra in the beginning of the loan the more bang for your buck youll get.Now heres something. Lets say you get a k mortgage  . Your total interest is . but you put k in the first month. Your total interest now is .  youll save  and youll cut  months from your mortgage. Downside? Your monthly payment will go from . to . which is . higher.If you can swing it the ideal is to pay a large sum right away if you can and then add additional monthly payments.HOWEVER you need to do the math because if you have other highinterest payments ex credit cards theres a good chance that youll pay less money overall by paying down the credit cards. For instance if you have a k balance with a  interest rate thats more important to pay down than your mortgage so always look at the overall picture when paying down debt.,LifeProTips,des8id0,2,t5_2s5oq

Heres the secret they dont tell you in vape stores premium juice uses a ton of sweetener. It might be ethyl maltol might be sucralose. Once you start DIYing youll notice that recipes just dont need to be that sweet most flavorings are sweet enough on their own. But if you think you need them then you can add them yourself.so for about  the price of three to sixish bottles of premium juice you can make ml of your favorite flavors. ml roughly costs me  cents to produce.But thats just if you want to be set for a few months. You could always follow this guide and spend as little as  including shipping and get started.Theres so much information out there to help you succeed too. Theres subreddits dedicated to it like rdiyejuice Read the sidebar and use the search. Seriously. all the flavors for recipes and sharing your own creations eliquidrecipes if youre not interested in a subscription model.DIY is like painting or sculpting. your tongue is the canvas. Getting that perfect mixture that you just cant wait to share with the community and get feedback is the best.Side note There had been some fearmongering a while ago about Diacetyl and Acetoin in flavorings and yes they do exist but the point of vaping has always been harm reduction. A smoking cessation method. In a cigarette you can find both diacetyl and acetoin in much much higher concentrations than you could ever hope to achieve with a vaporizer. Its up to you to make a decision one way or another some companies make a V or DX version which does not contain diacetyl but its not going to hurt you... and youll have a hell of a time finding a better buttery flavor.,LifeProTips,dev1jw5,17,t5_2s5oq

11186967,0,t3_5zmehk,Never tought a LPT could hit me this hard. Im gonna have a little story time here. When I was a kid I used to go my house near the sea to spent the holidays there.   There was no internet there there was a TV when you could only get  channels if you were in a lucky day no other kids my age to play with and my cousins used to go out at night because age speaking my closest cousin is  years older than me.  With time they started to not come anymore because well it was really boring.   We used played Briscola or Scopa Italian card games and he always bragged that he won the Italian Championship when he was younger I knew it was a lie since he went to war and was a war prison for  years after which he came back and immediately got married and started working as a fisherman for some years before moving to another country for work and come back after  years living there and whenever I won I felt like I was the best player in the world even though I knew he let me win on purpose.  He also spoke Dutch Italian Arab and some french and always said that he knew all the languages in the world which was not true but he said it as a joke and he really liked learning languages and other cultures.    I still remember when I was a kid he used to make fishing rods and incouraged me to fish.  I liked it for a while but dropped because I could not get any fish but I still loved that he went to all the trouble to find some sticks and buy rope to make me one. It might not seem like mutch but my Granddad could not walk without crutches so he could not move much.  I started to do Karate and he always told my mom that would pay for everything because he liked Karate even though he never did it but said that I should be able to fight for myself.  After  years I got injured to my right knee and had abandon it and he was sadder than I was.  We also used to dress him up as a pirate rockstar and many other things. He always played along no matter what we did and played that role making us laugh.  Without him my holidays in that place would have been empty and a waste of time. He was not Christian and did not believe or care about God because of his life probably.  He was the third brother of  his mother died when he was  and his father did not give a shit about it instead he decided to marry another girl which was not sane and had a son with her which was the th brother. So my Granddads sister had to take of his whole family her stepmother included. He had to abandon school when he was  and go to work to bring money home because his dad did not work much and did not care what happened to his son and daughters as long as his dick and belly were satisfied.  His stepbrother was an asshole to him his whole life but my Granddad still loved him and tried to make peace with him.  Did not succeed though.  I asked him why he did that and he said that he bore no grudge and that I should do the same and always try to make peace with others but stand up for my ideals.  Fastforward to  years ago. Last summer Ive ever seen him.   days before coming home I dressed him as a girl by puttin a bra on him and some lipstick.  I made a video called sexy grandpa where I told him to act sexy and make us laugh.  He delivered.  We came back home and I startd High school and exactly one monht after that day he had an ictus. We rushed back every trip was  km to go and another  km to come back and we stayed there for a while because he was in a coma. He woke up after some time but he had lost depth perception and timespace perception. Doctors told us about a possible memory loss so my mother asked me if he remembered me and he saidOf course I do how could I forget insert name.  I was really happy and tought everything was going to go alright. We came back home and I started back Highschool. I tought he was going to make it somehow. Boy was I wrong.  After a week he died and I was not there to see him.  We rushed back  km again and he was there in the casket white as a sheet. I did not cry to be honest I did not know how to react. I tried to touch him but no reaction I did not care at the moment for some reason.  I asked my mother to let me keep his crutches but she refused and buried them with him.  I come back and go on with my life but I feel like something is lacking. I change my cellphone and somehow I lost the video I shot but its ok my mom has it on her cellphone. Now my role model was him since he was thge one who gave me my morality because my father was an asshole who for my teen years always tried to hit on girls online closing himself in the computer room while yelling at me and my mother to stop getting in his way and get the fuck out of the room.  One day when I was not home he took her cellphone and broke it in half. My Grandpa was no more. I only found out about it after I came home I do not remember where I was and I was not angry I cried.  I still miss him and I wish he could see me now. I am studying Japanese because as I said before he loved other cultures and languages I liked as a child and he encouraged me to start it. Now I am going to Japan for  years to study the language and even though I do not believe in heaven or hell I still dream about him and he is still my guide in my dream. I still cry sometimes because I miss him I cried after reading this LPT. I dont care if no one reads this I just wanted to share this story which I never told anyone.

Either in clearing up the issue or in counseling for dealing with it.  It can really change your life and increase you happiness.  And I apologize if you find this out of line.

11195563,0,t3_5ztq35,Here are some things you can try There are a lot of Meetup events where it is an open event and anyone can show up and attend.   Try some of those.   If you wait around for someone to serenade you nothing will happen. Go volunteer somewhere there are tons of girls volunteering at animal shelters political rallies walkathons etc.   If you are in the United States try adult kickball or adult dodgeball leagues.   They arent really interested in the sport they are mostly just a reason to drink and hook up afterward.   There is also HHH Hashing clubs which are basically the same thing. Since it sounds like you are a nerdy introverted gamer nothing to be embarrassed about so am I then just find a venue and have your own lan party.  Tell everyone it cost money for a guy or a guy and a girl but if a guy brings two girls then everyone gets in free. Go get a job delivering pizzas you never know who you will meet. Spin classes.  They are  women.And remember no matter how introverted you think you are somewhere out there is a girl who will think its sweet but youll never meet her sitting at home.

11205303,0,t3_5zxzyu,I know that this will get buried in the comments but heres my two cents anyway.  When I had to have my dog euthanized I hired a mobile vet to come do it at my house.  My dog hated going to the vet so I didnt want her to be stressed.  She died on her own bed surrounded by her people.  That was the best choice for us.That being said I can see where if youre totally overwrought staying with your dog could be hard on it.  Theyre so tuned into our emotions that they will certainly pick up on how youre feeling.  I think it really has to be up to the individual and no one should feel guilty if they think it is best for themselves and for their friend. ,LifeProTips,df23uy4,1,t5_2s5oq

11205571,0,t3_5zxzyu,My vet who made house calls was out of town when my furry child of almost twenty years needed to be euthanized. The clinics I called were prohibitively expensive for me at the time. In desperation I called Pets Pets Pets. They said come on in. I walked in with my cat in my arms and broke down while speaking to someone who turned out to be amazing. She brought me into a patient room hooked up a catheter with what was probably some kind of sedative. My cat was undoubtedly not feeling good but the sedative relaxed him. She offered time alone with him and I took it gratefully. I snuggled him and kissed his head and he did the nose rub he was famous for and started purring. In a few minutes she came back. I looked away when she pushed a second syringe in. I never looked at him again because I didnt want to see his possibly open eyes with no life in them. When I went out of the room the staff had all signed a card for me which was very touching. All in all I was extremely impressed with their sensitivity. I walked back to my apartment and out of instinct thought to look for him as was my habit. That was . Circumstances and pain avoidance have prevented me from getting another pet. Maybe someday. Fuck I miss him.,LifeProTips,df24ybz,1,t5_2s5oq
11205580,0,t1_df1ym8q,I feel you brother. It literally destroyed me in the sense that I developed Brief Psychotic Disorder.Its a temporary condition that lasted till exactly  month after his death during which I heard someone run through the house I lived alone back then I heard my deceased dog bark he had a very specific bark he died of tracheal collapse and he could never bark all the way through making his bark quite unique so it wasnt the neighbours in the middle of the night when using the bathroom I felt my deceased dogs tail sweep my leg when I was having dinner I heard little children playing on the street at  AM and I looked out the window and saw nothing trains driving by the railroad I live near there are no trains at night here so again it was all in my mind. I was literally temporarily crazy.I probably got it because I wanted to be Mr. Toughguy and never showed a single tear even though the sorrow was tremendous. I just bottled up all my sadness and I effectively made myself go crazy because of it.Cry if you need to and as much as you need to. ,LifeProTips,df24zni,5,t5_2s5oq

The Resident Assistant is a great resource if you live in the dorms. I was and I loved when people came to me for help.Youre paying the university to be there make them work for you. Ask questions inout of class. Visiting the teacher in their office will give you  on  learning that you can never get in a lecture. Some will critique your essay and make suggestionscorrections that will boost your grade from a B to an A.

Youre also wasting your time and energy. Think of it as a D is for dumb ass.If youre stuck in a group project with dead weight  or youre doing all the work ask the professor to remove them or you from the group. Or when you are working with them  on  comment about it. They make an exception for you especially in the later classes.Your freshman classes are the worst.

11206100,0,t1_df23rlc,It is going to be slightly depressing but here is my story with my cat.Oliver is the best cat I have ever fucking seen period.  He is super friendly and loves coming in to check up on me even when he is well fed!  Now you might think that this is pretty typical of a sweet cat but it gets better.  He sleeps next to me every night even when it is hot as hell.  Moreover since he is a cat after all he will always lie next to me until I fall asleep and then he gets up and does his thing.You might be wondering how do I know this if I am asleep?  Well I have seen him up and about when I get up in the middle of the night and we always say hi to each other. In the morning he is always back in bed with me.  I know there are studies that show that sleeping in the same bed isnt good for your health but fuck it as a guy with pretty heavy depression having him here is quite nice.His sweetness goes further.  He not only greets me every day but also lies on top of me while I rest after work.  He even drools when we bond after work.  We eat together at the table... well eat isnt the right word for it since Oliver does not like any human food!  But he keeps me company while I eat and I let him roam around on the table because even though he refuses to eat human food he loves smelling it.This isnt even the tip of the iceberg.  I am convinced that Oliver knows when I am feeling especially poor or in pain because on many occasions that I have accidentally hurt myself and he always comes over to check up on me.  No this isnt your average wtf is going on check that animals do he comes up to my face and meows at me and for example the time when I stubbed my toe so badly that I thought I had broken a bone he lied down with me on the ground as I writhed in pain.I could go on and on about this but suffice it to say I consider him my best friend.  He is a  indoor cat mostly as a recommendation from my vet because of his personality and his heart condition.  This is where it starts getting sad so stop here if you dont want to read.I know that he doesnt have much time left so instead of being the usual pissydepressed person that I am I took it upon myself to make the most of it.  I try to make his environment as stress free as possible so as to not agitate his condition but I know he yearns to be outside.  I always keep windows open even in the winter we will sit next to a cracked open window and I let him use my legs as a ledge so he can watch through the screen.  He tries to hide his coughing from me by going downstairs but I can still hear him sometimes.  It is just soul crushing to know that there isnt anything more we can do.  The vets said there is an experimental surgery but it is not tested and they need more funding.  Fuck.It gets a little worse.  There was a person who handled him roughly in front of me.  This person accidentally flung him against my entertainment center.  I punched this person without thinking about it quite hard at that.  Not going to go into the details here but I was arrested and charged with common assault and the police said they would take my statement but they were not going to charge the other person.  Fuck that too.We moved into a fairly large house for just him just two years ago and while I was worried about the stress of the move on him he absolutely loves it.  He has a favorite tree just outside my living room which he can see it through bay windows.  He just sits there on the ledge for hours... that makes me happy.Whatever happens I know that the end will come and I know I will be there when it does.  Then he can stay with me and be at peace.TLDR I have an awesome cat he is sick but we still party hard and when it is all over he will still be here with me.Edit I posted another story with my older cat who is also named Oliver.  They are incredibly similar. I do not believe in the supernatural but it is uncanny how sweet both my cats have been.,LifeProTips,df274cl,1,t5_2s5oq

What kills me is that he somehow knew why we were taking him in. When he was at home his tail was between his legs and he was crying he didnt want to go for a walk because it was too painful to move sit and lay down for him.We get to the vet and he acted like nothing was wrong.He was more my moms lap dog but she couldnt be in there for it. I had taken him home from the humane society so I stayed with him.,LifeProTips,df27vy8,2,t5_2s5oq
11206297,0,t3_5zxzyu,Well. First of all people that stay with the pet usually do it to gain closure. Same as people who choose to look away. Deciding to euthanize pets in itself is a selfless painful decision that owners make have to make. I dont thinking its appropriate to sit so high in judgement of something so tragic. People deal with unfortunate events differently. Is it necessary to make them feel like they dont care just cause they cant bear watching life leave something they loved and cherished? Love and pain dont need to only be shown in a particular way to be genuine. Trying to restrict emotions into a narrow path of acceptable behavior would cheapen both the emotion as well as the behavior... IMO.,LifeProTips,df27xkp,1,t5_2s5oq
11206471,0,t3_5zxzyu,My fiance is a vet. I agree a million percent with this LPT. I have seen families come in and even though they know the inevitable the pet is a family member.

11221808,0,t1_df3yp1p,...and it will continue to climb until people stop enrolling and opt for more affordable educational opportunities. The reason why school charge so much is because they can. Yet community college is a fraction of the price. Also it is easier to go from electrical engineering to an electrician than the other way around. Almost anyone can get into a trade school just pay up. No SATs transcripts etc. However universities do have such requirements. Trade school comes with debts becoming a machinist can cost tens of thousands in tools. Same for a mechanic etc etc. Just a diagnostic test book can be thousands in a yearly subscription fee on top of the K it is to buy in. Going into a trade isnt free like many seem to think. It comes with its own share of debits and liabilities. You cant go into one trade change your mind mid stream then apply what youve learned towards another as you would college credits. Instead you start again at the bottom. chances are you change schools and tool sets. ,LifeProTips,df3z7tv,0,t5_2s5oq

11230687,0,t1_df4xvp8, Im  years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy Ill put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do  now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser then a honey almond body scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herbmint facial mask which I leave on for  minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer then an antiaging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.,LifeProTips,df4zevh,2,t5_2s5oq

Due to the size of the loveseat and the hallway configuration leading to that bedroom there is no way to get the loveseat out of the room without taking it apart which not being an Ikea type model would not be easy or possibly taking it out the window...which would first half to be removed as just opening it and taking out the screen would not provide an opening large enough.

Consenting to searches that would otherwise require a warrant or probable cause is the most common unnecessary mistake I see. Unless you know that they saw you stashing something chances are theyre just fishing and not willing to detain you longer than reasonable suspicion permits.

11294356,0,t3_614eew,The flip side of this which is very important to remember is that not reciprocating someones feelings is not the same thing as taking advantage of them. Feelings can arise in people without you doing anything to trigger them and you should never feel like you owe someone anything based on how they feel about you or things they have independently chosen to do. The only thing you are responsible for is being honest.I have had experiences where people pick me as  friend and begin trying to manipulate me into friendships with them through guilt over feelings they have or favors or similar caring behavior I never asked for being held over my head.Whatever someones feelings manipulation is never ever okay.

11333834,0,t1_dfgnxg9,Yes in theory I think someone could deliberately disable your use of the phone that way. I remember it happening accidentally as a kid my aunt or someone didnt put the phone down and we couldnt then use our phone. We could just hear her doing the dishes in the distance. I dont know if there is some kind of timeout or not. And it has been used as part of a scam. The fake bank caller gets you to call them back on your banks number they actually play a fake dial tone down the line then a fake ringing tone and then answer all the time the call never disconnected.However its handy for changing between multiple handsets in a home. You just put down the one you answer on walk to a different room and pick it up.Its always been just one of those weird things in life.Edit found this informative info And this quotegt Note this technique is not only much loved by fraudsters but when the delay was longer was often used by journalists who having contacted someone for a scoop would leave the phone off the hook to prevent their competitors phoning the same person whilst they raced around to do an interview.Looks like there is a timeout it used to be  minutes now it is  seconds.,LifeProTips,dfgo59g,6,t5_2s5oq

A degree from the University of Georgia and the University of Washington might look about the same in US News and World Report but the Georgia grad is much more likely to get the job both because the hiring manager is more likely to have gone to UGA and because their professional network is going to be significantly larger. There are plenty of gradations I make between schools outside of the Ivy League. If I had identical resumes in front of me from Harvard UVA Kentucky and West Texas AampM Id schedule interviews in that order every time. Employers have a general idea of what schools are more selective than others and all things being equal will use that as a screening criterion.But generally yes you shouldnt pay significantly more for a marginally better school.,LifeProTips,dfhtx4f,13,t5_2s5oq

11354174,0,t3_61yf3z,Agreed but I told my coworker anyways. Told him  months ago and he hasnt said anything yet. Putting my two weeks in tomorrow and fully expect to be fired on the spot. Louisiana is a state that requires employers to pay out PTO but my work does have a rule I have to put in a two weeks which they can do. But its because he is equally pissed and wants to live through me.Work in an office with about  people. Was hired last year with one other guy and we have been through the shit together. Our work took away all the perks of the job which was their selling point for low salary. The biggest perk was wed work  hour weeks for  months but then  for a couple of months and then  at most for  more. Well now we work those  and now  hours all the rest of the time so they can fire people in other departments and we do that work. And to top it off the moves us from salary to hourly because of the overtime law Obama was trying to pass and bounced around the idea of cutting our hourly rate during our busy season so overtime comes out to being the same as what we were for salary. Best part is that they told me this hours before I left for my flight to take my honey moon we delayed it a year because they had a no PTO rule the first  months. They find out were pissed leave me VMs telling me how much I mean to them and want to talk to me then yell and degrade me for my opinion. CFO tells me I need to swear my allegiance to him and the company the next day.So were now almost two weeks away from our busy season. Going to put my two weeks in tomorrow for a job that makes  more and my coworker couldnt be happier. It also helps that now this puts a lot of power in his court because they are making changes that put more work on us that no way they can implement now. So Im sure a lot of coworkers will tell. Im just lucky my brother in arms never did. ,LifeProTips,dfiz3gf,2,t5_2s5oq

They were kind enough to let me know that I get paid for PTO but not for sick leave so I should probably get headaches or go to the doctor on occasion. Needless to say I was sick at least one day a week for six months. I was even able to donate  hours of my remaining sick leave to a coworker who had lost her husband.

I absolutely DETEST recruiters that add stuff on that is bullshit or lie on a CV  it just gives the rest of us a bad name!!We have so many legal restrictions in the area I work in that if I say a candidate has qualified in this but they cant prove it it doesnt go on their CV  I dont care if you have a degree unless I can see the proof of that.Formatting is brilliant if you are applying directly but if you are going through a recruiter or an agency send a formatted one and a plain text one And please dont use boxes on your CV they are an absolute pain lol Congrats on getting the job x,LifeProTips,dg0251y,1,t5_2s5oq

Most of my experience is with Robo dwarfs which seem to be universally equipped with an extra shot of piss and vinegar. Syrian hamsters are probably more likely to have been bred to a better temperament plus handled properly due to their size but Ive still seen em slaughter each other and wouldnt trust one for a second.I will admit Im probably biased due to my experiences overseeing the rodent department at a pet store. The vast bulk of our casualties were hamsteronhamster violence thus I learned to associate them with death and bloodshed. Plus the fuckers always bit me for no reason. And also I always felt deep bitterness watching jerkass hamsters get sold as pets just because they were cute while my poor sweet feeder rats who Id raised from pinkies were deemed worthless for anything but snake food. ,LifeProTips,dg0jzrx,0,t5_2s5oq

The letter stated every detail of our meeting from the date the time that we boarded what I was wearing train number etc. probably everything except what I smelled like.

Funny story once I had surgery and was asked to stay in my grandmothers room.  She woke me up that night and asked me who the little boy in the room was.  I was confused and asked her who he was she looked me straight in the eyes and in the most serious tone said hes the little boy that cleans your moms ears. I bursted out laughing and she too understood what she said and begin to laugh.  She went back to bed not to long after.  Its one of my favorite memories of her.  I couldnt agree more with this top.

11697937,0,t1_dglygg3,It isnt the differential causing the traffic though. Its the speed of the traffic.  Your making an argument that is always true because youre basing it on a falsehood thats a tautology. If you could accept the physical fact that speed caused traffic your opinion would change. It is this reason youre wrong.  If your predicate were true  your argument would be also but its not.If there were two lanes ... One driving at  mph and the other driving at  mph and no deviation in speed the traffic flow would be good but the differential in speed would be mph.  In this example the differential is causing traffic because to move over the mph drivers need to slow to  mph to merge this is an example of when youre argument works.However when the speed limit whatever that is is enacted and drivers continue to speed.  The same thing happens proving that speeding causes the differential youre talking about ... People WILL ALWAYS SPEED thus its the enforcement that matters most to stop traffic.  Lowering the speed limit would also reduce traffic because lower speed roads are less likely to have traffic ,LifeProTips,dglz9zu,1,t5_2s5oq

The readers of this post might want to go to theringfinders.com  click on find a ringfinder click on the US flag then zoom in to NY State and then the Syracuse NY area and read my account of this search.  Also there they can find a ring finder in their area to find anything that is metal that has been lost.  Cell phone keys coins etc. along with rings. Although sometimes we fail we all try hard to reunite the ring with the owner so that the memorys can continue. Again Kevin thank you and wear you ring lovingly proudly and continue accruing memorys with it.  Connell ,LifeProTips,dgx1n8y,23,t5_2s5oq
