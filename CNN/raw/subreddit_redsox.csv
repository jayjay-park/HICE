336691,0,t1_cffnxw3,it is certainly interesting.

386110,0,t1_cfkokvx,Since coming back from all of the injuries hes fluctuated between being a bad pitcher and an average pitcher by ERA which I dont think has anything to do with the teams he was on. Hes going to be  in August which doesnt bode well for having a fluke year where hes amazing. I just dont see him putting up anything better than a . ERA in  innings as the best case scenario. Currently the Sox have a rotation consisting of Buchholz Lester Lackey Doubront and Peavy. Roster locks for the bullpen are Uehara Tazawa Muijica Breslow Miller Badenhop which leaves one spot that could go to Workman  De La Rosa Webster  Drake Britton Alex Wilson Steven Wright or now Capuano. Additionally they have Hinojosa Rich Hill who is a few injury plagued years removed from being pretty damn good Jose Mijares and Brayan Villareal who has great stuff if he could ever stop walking people as nonroster invites. I think almost everyone will agree that Workman is better than Capuano right now. De La Rosa a year removed from Tommy John is another candidate to be a lot better than Capuano and has had major league success before getting hurt. I dont mind Capuano I just wish he was on a minor league deal where we could send him to the minors if someone beats him for a job and have him around for when someone inevitably gets hurt Buchholz Doubront and Peavy dont have a great history. Also in the case of Pierzynski the only catcher we have in the minors who has played in the majors is Lavarnway who cant handle it defensively which is probably the primary reason Farrell declined to play him when Ross was out and has some questions about whether he can handle major league pitching. We saw last year that as good as Jackie Bradley Jr. is its almost impossible to make the jump from Double A to the Majors which is what Vasquez would have to do this year. Butler probably needs another year anyways to refine his hitting some more so he isnt a good candidate. The Sox have already had Workman De La Rosa Webster Wilson and Wright in the majors and they would be asked to pitch garbage relief innings as theyre eased in. I dont particularly trust any of them to start a game right now well learn more about their progress as the spring progresses other than Workman but I think that theyd be at least ok in relief. ,redsox,cfksb2o,0,t5_2qh95

We can find an exact time that the ball enters the glove well with the right camera angle.

1714005,0,t1_cjv3ri8,I really think that the lack of a leadoff is a pretty huge problem that everybody is overlooking and I would really be happy to see Betts in that position. Almost everything about him screams leadoff. He should be able to hit for average but my favorite part is that he can also fly. Betts has the potential to steal a shit ton of bases which is something that nobody else on the current team seems to be able to do. I would scream if we traded Betts for Stanton because we dont need Stanton. Our only  hr guy might just be Ortiz but well also have Craig Cespedes and Napoli to pad the middle of the order. What we really need to think about if we want to build a good team is having a complete lineup not one that just hits a bunch of solo HRs.  On the subject of Betts vs. Bradley in CF I would definitely want to see JBJs sexy defense out there every day provided he figures out which end of the bat to hold but I would be very very averse to trading Betts away. Although it doesnt look like its gonna happen I would definitely want to put Betts in the infield at SS over Xander. Failing that would it be possible for Mook to play B? Im getting very tired of WMB and Kelly Johnson very quickly and if we want to be a winning team next year were gonna have to do something about B.,redsox,cjv7nuq,4,t5_2qh95

2220003,0,t1_clm092j,Reason Id look to sign another cuban is because we wont be able to spend more than K on international players for the next two years. So anyone that is worth it you sign them before June th. But we still have to wait for people to get residency in other countrys and get set up which could take a long time. I just like that Moncado has high high high upside highest yet and hes a switch hitter like Sandoval and allegedly  years younger. Tomas could be someone to look at if they think about trading Cespedes and if we trade Cespedes we need to start thinking of who we are gonna get in return. I dont want to go after Hamels Ive said it before and Cespedes amp company could land us things we arent even thinking of. David Wright and Niese? Adrian Beltre? We need to add some lefties to our lineup so maybe we will go after Connor Gillaspie for a B?Also I think of what we have and what teams could benefit. Cecchini has a good bat and is a lefty. But his fielding has lacked. We could go after a guy like Beltre and give Cecchini another year or two to develop in fielding. Cespedes could excel in Rangers Park and they got guys there for the IF. They have Andrus Odor and Profar will be back. Then Fielder is their B. They could use help in OF and I think an OF of Cespedes Choo and Rios would be great for Rangers. Theyd have power galore in a very hittable ballpark. If they need more why not give em a ground ball pitcher in Webster. That gets you a top B who has one year and one team option left and can be locked up till . Then maybe go elsewhere to find a lefty bat for this season. Mike Napoli is on a one year deal? Hmm maybe there is a lefty B on the market? Maybe trade for Votto?

2301348,0,t1_clw5lju,Yah there really arent many options at third for a lefty bat.  Headley definitely wouldnt be the answer and I agree than Sandovals contract is not going to be worth it.  I definitely dont see Cespedes coming back with everything thats come out and he probably is going to ask for a lot more than hes worth after next year so they might as well try and get something for him.  Im not relying on Victorino to be healthy and be an everyday guy in the lineup next year so I dont think hes the answer.  Melky is an interesting one but he worries me a bit.  He did have a good year coming back from the suspension but Id be worried about committing to him for awhile.  He does hit well at Fenway so he could be a good fit.  The others guys that come to mind for me are Markakis and Heyward but I think those are a bit of a long shot.

Also I believe it would go against the whole philosophy Cherington is doing. He has a rotation of ground ball pitchers so why would he change that to having  ground ball pitchers and  that is not a ground ball pitcher? Then Id go on and say that our rotation could consist of Owens Rodriguez and Miley at some point in a year or two and if you add Hamels why would we want  lefties in our rotation?

2577761,0,t3_2padfa,It is the same exact type thing that was going on last year when they were going around saying that their philosophy won them the World Series. You saw John Henry at MIT saying that the way to build a team was through your own farm system and then supplement the big league squad with veterans on short contracts to expand the teams flexibility. Hell Lucchino even laughed and made fun of the spending mentality of the Yankees. Flash forward to this year and the Sox spending big money signing old veterans to long term deals directly in contrast to what they were spewing to us throughout .   I believe that Ben John and Larry know that this team needs a front end pitcher. Not necessarily an ace but a front end guy to rely on in the post season. The problem is though that they do not like the guys on the FA market and the trade options cost too much in terms of prospects especially when half of the potential targets are going to be FAs next year. So until they can hop in on the bidding for Fister Zimmerman Cueto Iwakuma Grienke Kennedy Luebke Price Sarmadzija at this time next year we will hear about How the team doesnt need an ace and that Aces are overrated to win in baseball now just look at the Orioles! But just know that they recognize they can get that front end guy next year in a cheaper market and give Owens another year to develop into a front end stud. ,redsox,cmv1v5g,1,t5_2qh95

3411942,0,t1_cph3qd3,Giants fans are sad to see him go but his words about the team are insult to injury.  The general public had no idea he didnt feel at home with the team and are sad to hear this.  Aubrey Huff stuck his nose in where he shouldnt have but he knows that current players cant say what he said without some sort of backlash.  More sour grapes from fans come from the fact that he left for less money than SF offered has a lessthanreputable agent who treats negotiation tactics as a personal affront and the fact we lost one of our playermascots.  Hes a great player that we were sad to see go but sadder to see that hes burning his bridges.  He doesnt quite have his head on straight and Boston will need to keep an eye on him.  Hes very immature and this is a big move for him.  Personally I hope he crushes every pitch he sees and shows what hes capable of unless its the WS against SF or course.,redsox,cph6pz1,3,t5_2qh95

3449020,0,t1_cplefxe,gtWe traded Lackey who had a year on his contract at minimum salary thanks to an injury clause for Craig.And Kelly who I think was the main target. Craig was part of the price as St. Louis needed to get out from under his contract given that theyd committed to Matt Adams at B.gtIf he never gets to play to rebuild trade value or we never use him then that was a massive fucking waste to trade Lackey in the first place.Eh. They traded Lackey because  was a lost cause and they didnt think hed play for the minimum in . It was just an exercise in proper asset management. You could argue they should have targeted prospects rather than MLB players but dont forget just how bad the  OF was and that this trade preceded the Castillo signing. gtwe wont even know if Craig is better than resigning Nap unless we can play Craig.I think this will all work itself out as logjams are wont to do but even if Craigs actual game time is limited the coaches and FO should get a good enough look at him to know whether theyre comfortable penciling him in as the B in .,redsox,cplexsi,4,t5_2qh95

One game there was a walk off HR by the home team not the White Sox and he did not say ANYTHING until the batter crossed the plate and then he said well thats it.  You can shade toward the home team no problem.  Especially if you are paid by a regional network NESN YES etc..  However I have a line.  You are STILL broadcasting for both teams fans.

Hanley is still on an incredible pace offensively and Pablo has been subpar but better than the B trash weve had the past few seasons.Have some patience.  We all thought the Lackey deal was terrible and he ended up playing a huge role in the  WS run.  These players are proven veterans with a history of success you cant write them off so soon.  Theres also the oftrepeated example of Pedeys half a season of shit production before winning ROY MVP and becoming who we all know and love today.  People just need to relax and understand that in the bigger picture of things our organization is deep talented and primed for many years of success.Sure the pitching has been garbage.  But to call Hanley and Pablo albatrosses is simply wrong.

4666510,0,t3_3ev12c,So the Blue Jays traded a good injury prone SS for a way better injury prone SS. Blue Jays also got the everyoung LaTroy Hawkins who I think will be the real steal here for the Blue Jays!Rockies get Miguel Castro and Jeff Hoffman plus another minor leaguer yet to be named. I would be extremely interested in who that other minorleaguer is going to be.Umm.Rockies have to flip Jose Reyes right? He is making almost the same amount of money per yer while less years than Tulo. Rockies dont save any money right here and now which I feel you would want to do if you are having a fire sale. Id blow it up and take on a terrible contract or two from a team and take prospects in return so they can start building up.Both teams need pitching. Toronto isnt somehow much better by adding another bat even if it is Tulo. Id be concerned about the fact they lost good speed in Reyes. I like speed and think its underrated. Tulo will have to get used to playing on the Turf.Blue Jays still dont have pitching.The Blue Jays got rid of their leadoff hitter. Who leads off now?WHY DO THEY NEED ALL THESE BATS?!I honestly dont think this makes the Blue Jays better for this year at the moment but they have to flip some bats for pitching.. right? What bats will they flip? E? Im just so confused at the moment as to why. I understand the rational Why not and I understand the great value for Tulo but I think this is a case of too much. I think this wont help them... and if anything maybe make them worse while he has to learn the new playing field adapt to new pitchers and he will get injured.Maybe we are looking at this the wrong way. Maybe they really wanted LaTroy Hawkins and then the Rockies said Want Tulo too? because LaTroy Hawkins is the best to help the team currently.. ,redsox,ctirnpx,7,t5_2qh95

5068031,0,t1_cuw8xsa,gt Mets need players ready now because of winnow mode.. why would they take anyone other than Betts?It is possible though highly unlikely that you could pair some younger prospects with a Hanley Ramirez or Pablo Sandoval to the Mets to get the job done. An Owens  Ramirez  Devers package would likely not be enough but it is the type of package that MIGHT start the ball rolling. Mets get a serviceable young pitcher to fill the gap in their rotation. They get young potential in Devers. And they get Ramirez who  when healthy  is an elite bat for the win now mentality. If the Mets are intent on trading Harvey  then I cant imagine many teams could top that type of package. ,redsox,cuww0oq,1,t5_2qh95

So if youre new to baseball you are going to struggle for a while in the beginning because baseball intricacies will be new to you. I understand you could play basically one button mode...but I dont see any fun in that personally.What will be hard? Youll have to learn baseball strategy and terms and philosophies. Example youll have to learn that the proper way to handle a curveball thrown by a right handed pitcher to a right handed batter is to sit back wait on the pitch and then go with the location of the ball and drive it to the opposite field in the air on a line or on the ground being dependent on the pitch location. And thats just one pitch in one scenario. Youll have to learn the differences between seam seam and cut fastballs. This is only the beginning. That being said once you learn these things or for those of us that learned these things growing up and through continued fan hood The Show is amazingly realistic and therefore fun. My buddy watched me play it thought it looked amazing bought it for himself and returned it after playing batting practice for mins. His reason for returning it it looked so much easier when you were playing it. As soon as I started batting practice I realized how little I knew about baseball.TLDR The Show is really awesome because its so realistic.

6209110,0,t3_40mbnd,Its ok not great. Went last year. This may be my last. Im sure some went last year got lucky and met some good players. But if you dont like lines its not the place for you. Keep in mind your  ticket gets you ONE auto and ONE pic. You could get anyone for autos  the pics are usually better stars. So who you get is an extreme crapshoot. We were in line for a pic with Napoli and he ended up leaving and I think Bogaerts came in. Good if you like Bogey. Awful if you like Nap. Not trying to sound bitter. But the White Sox did the same thing on the same weekend last year with much better transparency as to who would be where and when. I know its hard to manage all the people  but the problem lies in they dont cap the tickets to a manageable capacity. Its a giant money grab. As far as kids oriented. Yes and no. There is the Grand Pequot ballroom where you only get in with a wrist band. Thats where all the players and the WS trophies were.The other ballroom you can go into all day. Really where the WS trophies should be. All the other hardware MVP GG SS are in here as well as a lot of the kids stuff you see. I also think they should pull the minor leaguers and assistant coaches out of the main room and put them throughout the event mainly in this room. There was space and itd make it more likely you get a star pic or auto instead of Allen Craig or Anthony Ranaudo. So yes beyond the limited random auto and pic  its pretty kid oriented. You can wait in the many lines for the Tweet or Instagram machines. They gave out some decent prizes last year. Bobble heads game and some season tixAll in all I enjoyed it but had I not gotten some good pics and had some extra tickets since people couldnt go affording me extra autospics  I would probably not be going this year. Mainly going to see if theyve improved anything and to see if I can get a Clemens or Varitek pic. Would love Tek to sign a pic of him hitting ARod. ,redsox,cyveq91,5,t5_2qh95

6367183,0,t1_czdc19m,We have  years of service time on a player a year is  days they earn a day by being on the active  man roster or major league Disabled List. So they wouldnt bring him up unless he was very close because if he comes up at  years old in September and cant hit or field theyve wasted a month of time that they could have had when hes  and possibly one of the best players in the game. Sometimes that month or two doesnt matter since if they have . years.days so  days away from the th year of service time at the end of the season they will not be a free agent till the following year. But if they go wasting some of that time when hes not close to ready and then when hes borderline ready then when someone goes down the next year and hes called up to fill their position earlier in the season that month of garbage may be enough to give him a full year of service time. Unless absolutely necessary teams want to make sure they get as close to . out of the  year rookie deal since the older they are they will most likely be far more valuable. ,redsox,czddnbl,2,t5_2qh95

6432439,0,t1_czkjd93,Ortiz was on better Red Sox teams in an era where its easier to make the playoffs. Sure his  ALCS was huge and his  WS was incredible. Still so small compared to Yaz.Yaz was on some awful teams and yet he consistently played like a top  position player year in and out. His accomplishments over his  years in Boston are almost storybook.  Impossible Dream Triple Crown MVP  x All Star x Gold Glove x Batting ChampHe also played the wall better than anyone ever has. His career embodies a majority of Red Sox history of coming so close to a championship only to have it slip away in the final seconds. The idea of heartbreak toil and looking towards next year was the Red Sox mantra for  years. The man literally gave the best years of his life to this team and never left to find success or a ring elsewhere. I understand how big Papi has been for this team as of late and we are spoiled with success. His chapter in Red Sox lore is huge but no matter what Yaz has him beat. Also in the postseason  series Yaz slashed ... which although a smaller sample size  games fewer is better than Ortizs. I know ridiculous to bring upbut my point is this. Most great players post great numbers in the post seasons. We remember Ortiz specifically for  series. If Yaz had as many opportunities he likely would have put up some great memories. As it is in  postseason games he has  HR  RBI  H and  BB. Just cause Papi was there doesnt take away from Yaz and it certainly makes Papi look great. ,redsox,czknhw9,1,t5_2qh95

Ive encountered plenty of ignorant Boston fans but I wouldnt go as far as saying the whole city is filled with them..My take on the situation? Personally if I was at the stadium I wouldnt give him a standing ovation. I respect his career and would probably clap his first time up partly due to elation of his time killing us being over and partly out of respect for his career. But to me I would only give a standing ovation to a guy who I completely respect their personality and what they did for the game no matter what team they played for. Its not a matter of brushing off Papis career like it was nothing. Any fan that says that or tosses PED arguments around is just ignorant. But I dont have to stand and clap for the man just because he did well against my team.

The Red Sox are not a solid team and have more questions about realizing potential at many positions than most teams. Benching Tubby was good that will help. But the starting rotation is fraught with potentially devastating results. Every single year from the mids on the Sox fans consider themselves contenders until late May with only about  perhaps  notable exceptions. Please keep in mind that the Red Sox finished pitifully for  of the past  years. Always fun to watch nearly always disappointing.

Theres just too long a list of cant miss guys that never make the big leagues and it dwarfs the list of proven talent that couldnt play in Boston.  Again I do see your side and its a valid way to build Houston and Tampa for example but its not the way I prefer.With regard to this team I think they need two things a late inning reliever and a top end starter.  This is thinking big picture.  They could get a fifth starter and win the division but in the playoffs they need another starter to slot behind Price.  Maybe Wright or Porcello is that guy but who knows.  Personally I dont want to be forced to take that gamble because some  year old might be pretty good someday.

7899754,0,t1_d42t9kx,A lot of people feel a lot of things but according the box score Noe has pitched twice in June was in Pawtucket the entire month of May in backtoback losses. He pitched the final outs in both games. He gave up two home runs in a third of an inning against Toronto after Ross and Tazawa had already effectively lost the game for the Sox in what ended up a  defeat. Ross was brought in to maintain the tie and gave up a hit and walk. Tazawa sucked and gave up three runs including two HRs. Noe was basically brought on to spare tazawa and get to the end of the game.Then he pitched . scoreless against Toronto but the sox couldnt rally against Osuna and lost .  Koji had relieved Price and gave up a run HR that more or less sealed the game.Hardly highleverage usage and in the only game that both appeared Ross was the one called upon when it mattered.I think everyone is frusterated because weve had a really shitty two weeks losing  of our last . The bullpen has repeatedly shit the bed during that stretch giving up too many home runs.

The one thing that made me ok with them trading him was that he hadnt been a real offensive force at his level since  and still never really was at the offensive levels Bradley Betts or Boegarts were at in the minors.Guerra is a great defensive shortstop who suddenly started hitting for a lot of power out of nowhere. This year the HR are still there but the strikeouts are way up and his average is very low. Still very young but he was traded on one years hype. ,redsox,d603qc4,2,t5_2qh95

Hard to believe theres a specific combination of those two relievers that will close down games every single night or that Tazawa and Abad would be effective pitchers if used in different situations.

The bullpens thin regardless of whos managing the team theres no real explanation that anyone knows of for the troubles with the bases loaded a young lineup is usually going to mean a streaky lineup at no point during this season did I think Farrell would be fired nor am I sure what kind of an upgrade if any is represented by Torey Lovullo.  So basically Ive been under the impression that while this team has flaws theyre not flaws that can be fixed during the course of a season.  Well either have to win despite them or hope they dont rear their ugly head until were at least somewhat satisfied.Because of that all Ive even been able to do as a fan this year is sit back and enjoy the roller coaster.

He is so talented that at the age of just  he shined a very public light on a multibilliondollar businesss flaccid and discriminatory system designed specifically to suppress the wages of teenage Latin American ball players by singlehandedly pushing it to its limit. He forced Major League executives to confront a onceinhistory scenario a stoned sports fans hypothetical question about loopholes and generational talents How much money is the best teenager on the planet worth up front?As a longtime follower of the business of baseball and smart teambuilding I think this is a great point. Moncadas availability was a test case for how much young talent is worth on the open market. And it highlights the wage suppression that the MLB draft imposes on players  Jason Groome probably wasnt the same caliber of prospect as Moncada but he slid reportedly due to the expectation of an overslot bonus of .

There is also a story about a Red Sox employee who sexually assaulted young black bat boys repeatedly and how the team know about it and covered it up for years akin to the Penn State scandal but farther back in the past and an added racism angle.Hopefully those events are in the past.Boston is a city that has come to love guys like Bill Russell Pedro David Ortiz and the like.

11802800,0,t1_dgxdlu5,I hate the logos but having had a job interview with New Era a few years ago I can tell you why theyve done it. People were thinking the MLB logo was the manufacturer logo and they didnt know who was making the hats. It drove them crazy. Now I dont see that being MLBs problem but New Era obviously threw them a few extra bucks to get the logo on the hats and MLB are whores for money. ,redsox,dgxvzqc,2,t5_2qh95
