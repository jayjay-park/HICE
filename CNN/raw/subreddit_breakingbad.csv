So many Oh thats why they did that moments in this show where not only were you being pulled along by what was happening with the narrative but you would start to anticipate what was going to happen by guessing at the visual and verbal clues.

192415,0,t1_cf0amuw,. Jesse left the drug business because his partner didnt mind child casualties.. Jane got herself back into drugs. Jesse didnt force her to do anything. . You cant patent illegal Meth formulas. Dont eat oreos if you have a problem with people stealing ideas.. Hank being brought to the junkyard is Walts fault just as much as it is Jesses. Walt knew that Hank was on Jesses tale and consciously withheld that information from Jesse. Walt didnt realize that Badger would find out and really the nature of how Badger found out is best seen as a terrible coincidence. . Regarding the whole dime on Walt in season  thing you conviently leave out the part where Jesse gets beaten nearly to death as a result of Hank reacting to Walts plan. Jesse was pissed off because he took all of the punishment for something that the two of them both did. Judging from the fact that Walt was able to talk him out of it I am sure that Jesses determination to bring down Hank was a short term reaction to nearly being killed. . Walt chose to save Jesse and ruin their relationship with Gus.,breakingbad,cf0ctz5,7,t5_2rlw4

He goes to Alaska buys a store with living space above it and continues making money by building nice boxes and selling them through the store. He eventually gets married to a woman who really appreciated the work and craftsmanship he put into his boxes and they eventually have a few kids.Walt Jr.  Changes his legal first name to Flynn buys a challenger with his trust fund money goes to college for English and Creative Writing and eventually becomes a bestselling author after writing a book about his dad. After giving his mom a chunk of the money with the stipulation that she put some away for Holly he donates the rest of his money to Cerebal Palsy research and builds another donation website for cancer patients around the world.Skylar  Buys another carwash and a new home with the money that Walt Jr. gave her and puts the rest away for Holly. She eventually remarries and has one more child.Holly  Eventually goes to college and becomes a very successful lawyer. She works at a successful firm gets paid very generously and invests in a few more carwashes for Skylar.

948627,0,t1_chc2i6p,I dislike this sort of analysis which treats the Heisenberg persona as a sort of Mr. Hyde to Walts Dr. Jekyll. I think it detracts from the point and reduces the show to a far more simplistic and dull vision of evil. Breaking Bad is about change but specifically the process of change. Its like Macbeth insofar as its about the slippery slope into evil. Its not about moral polarities. Its not about being good one minute and bad the next. Heisenberg is not Walts alterego its Walt with a hat and a pseudonymous name. He doesnt behave fundamentally any different as Heisenberg than as Walt his behaviour simply varies according to the environment he is in. Long story short Breaking Bad is about the slow decay of goodness in a person and the shows cleverness lies in just how hard it is to pin down at what point Walt actually becomes evil. If you say that Walt just becomes this other part of himself at certain points it completely removes this element of moral slippage because it tries to say that there is no moral ambiguity in Walt  hes either being good or hes being evil. This is simply not the case. Walt is a moral grey area for most of the show  hes slowly descending the moral ladder hes not a LuciferturnedSatan nor is he a morally flipflopping JekyllHyde. He has a double life certainly but I reject the idea that he has a double personality.,breakingbad,chc479w,21,t5_2rlw4

As OP stated being found in the lab Walt is able to take all the blame and get Jesse off the hook.Everything youve pointed out are valid questions but its the end of the series.  Im going to assume Vince Gilligan is going with the happy ending it was and not worry too much about the potential holes left from the crime scene.DEA finally took down the blue methgot Walt.

1240476,0,t3_28aveq,Maybe they needed more money after Walt JR was born with Cerebral Palsey  so that was why Walt sold his shares in Grey Matter?     Maybe Walt  had planned to chance it with Grey Matter for longer and see how it went but Skyler couldnt return to work sooner because JR  needed more care than originally expected. See the scene where they walk around the home for the first time  describing it as just a starter home. They had bigger plans! So what changed? I think Walt JR being born changed it.

It couldnt be less ambiguous.Oh for sure that wasnt lost on me. Its certainly obvious that neither of them wants to kill Krazy  neither of them are killers at that point well Walter did just off Emilio but whatever. But the thing is they always seem to discuss the situation as if its dissolve Emilio OR murder Krazy  when its really dissolve Emilio OR murder amp dissolve Krazy  Wasnt their whole schtick supposed to be a  division of labor?Not only that but they haze the details even more by not showing Walter disposing of him or buying a proper barrel more hydrofluoric acid or flushing him down the drain or any of that AND they dont even mention it again except in one passing line of dialogue by Jesse two men going down the drain or whatever it was.I guess it does make for a cool scene though when Jesse comes back to his house halfexpecting to find that Walt still hasnt taken care of it only to find his place totally spotless almost as if nothing ever happened.Okay maybe its not really a flaw since it all technically makes sense but its still a story quirk that bugs me a tiny bit.

1795554,0,t1_ck5gwu9,gt Remember Jesse was the one who actually killed Gale and Gus eventually got over that.Because he saw Walt as the real problem. Theres no guarantee he wouldnt have invented a need for a real chemist after Walt was gone and then once the new chemist was up to snuff just killing off Jesse at that point. I wouldnt say he ever got over it since that was the main reason for Gus wanting to replace Walt in the first place.I hear what youre saying on showing up to Guss house with a gun which probably escalated the situation to where Gus felt like he couldnt wait until after he was done with the Cartel. But the thing to remember is that as badass as he seems at times Gus is still a crime lord. If he cant control his people he has to get rid of them especially if they seem ambitious or proud. I seriously doubt he would have let Jesse continue in his current position. He may have reassigned him rather than killing him maybe but I dont think he really felt like Jesse was a real replacement when he didnt even think Gale was an acceptable replacement.Its also worth noting that Tyrus was probably watching Guss house for a reason that night.,breakingbad,ck5h8o7,1,t5_2rlw4

2230245,0,t3_2kn0xr,SPOILERS Lots of things in BB are about mirror images as Walt mentions in the first episode during his class lecture and how two seemingly entirely different things are the same but reversed.Externally Hank is bold brash strong competent insensitive and his own unique version of badass. Internally he is frightened scarred as in PTSD  horrified and vulnerable. His outward persona is the opposite of his inner reality.On the outside Walt seems to be weak meek frightened and easily overwhelmed but we discover that internally he is brutal bold insensitive and in control. Walt seems to be pleased with keeping little trophies both literal and behavioral of his past conquests i.e. his cutting the crusts from his sandwiches as he picked up from Crazy  or the Walt Whitman book from Gale. Perhaps the tokens remind Walt of his newfound power and determination.Hank on the other hand cant bear to be reminded of his brush with death. He was terrified and possibly believes that a true badass couldnt be as frightened as he was. He feels like a poser and he kind of is because he wont let anyone in on his suffering. Its sad though because as they say the definition of courage is to feel the fear and do it anyway. He is also horrified by violence death and the gore of this battle between good and evil. Walt has no problem dissolving people in acid to suit his needs.The difference between the two men too is that Hank kills because he must defensive whereas Walt kills because he wants to offensive.,breakingbad,clnbffl,6,t5_2rlw4

For the entire rest of the show whenever anyone needs a lawyer its always Saul Saul Saul Saul Saul Saul Saul  and then all of a sudden they introduce this second lawyer out of absolutely nowhere just so he can fuck up get caught and advance the plot without actually costing us Saul. Dans transparently a plot device in that regard.Still it does make sense that there would be a different lawyer working for Gus. It had already been well well well well well established that Saul knows nothing about Gus operation and never had any direct or personal dealings with him.

I enjoyed the show and in my opinion the ending was great! Especially when Walt is talking. To Skylar for the last time and finally admits to her why he did it and how it made him feel worth something. At the very end he finally saw what he had become and how selfish he was. Hanks death also caught me by surprise but it made the show even more interesting! I feel like I could go on about this series! One of my top shows. ,breakingbad,crhc8g7,1,t5_2rlw4

But theres that flashback where Tio holds one of the Cousins heads under water when theyre children and the conversation Tio is having on the phone is some thing about chicken brothers big General...south Americans are dirty people. and then when they kill Max they say some thing to Gus about knowing his past in Chile...So my favorite theory? Gus used to be a real badass in the Chilean army a General but then moved north to try and become a legitimate businessman. The Cartel knew his past put him in his place. But Gus became successful anyway and the Cartel wanted a piece of that still.Damn I gotta rewatch such a vast universe they made.,breakingbad,ct4gorc,1,t5_2rlw4

Instead they pictured Walt as the Evil Juice Box Man going into Brocks school and giving him a juice box that had juice from the poison berries. And if youll look closely at episode  Face Off thanks to Greg below for pointing this out when Walt busts into Sauls office Francesca is shredding school schedules. Its a big spreadsheet of classes and times but there are notes on the side that seem to be one students personal schedule most likely Brocks. So kudos to the writers on including that little detail and again to Greg for noticing that whats was being shredded.Source ,breakingbad,cupjdgd,21,t5_2rlw4

Andrea....that sucked. Jesse told Todd ANYBODY who was a witness. ...seriously it sucked about Drew Todd did what he understood Jesse to mean. Gomey was dumb straight up!  Hank was always right and he never listened but didnt deserve to die because Hank wouldnt involve the DEA. I also wish Mike could have ridden off into the sunset and seen Kaylee one day hit man or no. This is all fantasy so I feel its okay to care about the deadeyed cretin I liked Mike. Victor was a witness to Gales murder and people saw him obviously thats why he had to go but Walt so smart says its to send a message really? Gus knew what was up!

He was basically a run of the mill burnout who was just a pawn among Crazys slice of the methland. Enter Walter White and Jesse becomes a much bigger criminal largely through Walters pushing.

And you also know the main character is going to become bad by the end of the show as that was the entire premise turning a character from Mr Chips to Scarface. The thrill of the show is watching what triggers the changes in character. I saw the final episode first and had Hanks bit spoiled for me. I still enjoyed the show and was surprised and shocked and what happened. The show is a  and you definitely will enjoy it. The moral dilemmas appear right in the second and third episodes and the show just moves very fast. The second season is when I realised I was watching a truly great show.,breakingbad,cxi8s7t,5,t5_2rlw4

6338301,0,t1_cza2jbe,Your plan also relies on assumptions. Simply changing the edit and moving the scenes around doesnt explain everything you type out. Not everything has to be stated directly but everything you type out is not the way the episode feels when youre watching which is an important part of how the script and the edit are supposed to cooperate. Thats why the episode does what it does the way it does it. So you can see them prep for a train heist get a general idea of what theyre thinking of doing and it feels natural in the way it seems like theyre prepping piece by piece to get ready. Minus the plot hole the scenes are nicely paced and easy to follow the narrative.Changing the edit to erase the plot hole your way now makes it so the audience has to assume that Walter had sat and thought of multiple plans that the guys all rushed in one day to make the plan they went with viable that Walter and Mike are willingly attempting a plan that they werent completely ready to perform with under  hours until the real thing. The plan to erase the laptop wasnt perfect but they didnt just throw it together in  minutes. They went and they tested the magnets made sure to get a good amount of batteries and then the rest was typical trespassing bullshit that weve seen Mike do a million times. Its not necessarily the same level of risk as robbing  gallons of pure chemicals from a train.Its not that it doesnt make logical sense to do it the way you suggest. Its just that it changes so much about the episode which is not good. It changes the tone it suggests a lot of plot details that the show doesnt give any indication are going on it doesnt show them going over possible plans or discussing how perfect the heist has to be little narrative clues to whats going on behind the scenes etcChanging the edit means not adding anything just rearranging whats already there. Imagine it goes from Lydia telling them about the train then telling them shell tell them what number train car it is the night before then her telling them the number then them showing up the next day to find a spot and activate a plan. TECHNICALLY with that yes the audience can assume that maybe they had thought up plans and were waiting for the location to pick the best plan. But its gonna look like they were told about the score Lydia called to confirm the score now theyre setting up.  Its not gonna look as obvious as you think and in retrospect the episode is gonna feel oddly pieced together and relying on too much assumption going forward.However changing the script so that Lydia gets the information sooner means they can keep the cut of the episode they went with and the content of the episode remains what was intended by the writers.Your way is plausible just overly complicated when all youre doing is fixing this plot hole thats not really a big deal.,breakingbad,cza3ets,1,t5_2rlw4

Case in point Season  Episode  HermanosAfter being questioned by Merkert Roberts Hank and Gomie about his fingerprints at Gales apartment his connection with Gale and his whereabouts on the night of his murder Gus deflects everything masterfully. Then Hank at this point in the show hes the only DEA agent on Frings trail the other agents were only humoring him asks him why theres no record of him in Chile to which Fring claims Pinochet and his government are guilty of being terrible filekeepers amongst other things. The agents respectfully say their goodbyes to Gus as he coolly and calmly walks out of the meeting.In the very next shot we see Gus in the elevator anchoring himself by tapping his middle finger and thumbs lightly against each other as he contemplates the events that just transpired. Surely theres very little he can do to express himself enclosed by himself in an elevator in the DEA building no less but its clear that the man was a fucking rock.The only time he let his emotions get the better of him was in relishing his victory over the cartel to Hector which would eventually be his demise.Everyones an expert until they fuck up.,breakingbad,czvengc,8,t5_2rlw4

6830459,0,t1_d0px71i,OK I have a theory which will resolve all these issues its called the broken toilet theory. Basically the second toilet is unreliable. Walter keeps fixing it and it keeps breaking badly . So its operational in some episodes and not in others. Come to think of it if this is the reason that Hank uses the ensuite bathroom in Gliding Over All the broken toilet is responsible for Walts whole downfall. So the real story is about Walts arrogance in thinking he can fix the toilet on his own instead of calling a plumber. Just call a plumber Walter. ,breakingbad,d0qj76u,9,t5_2rlw4

7000118,0,t3_4batv5,Hey guys Im late to the party! Ive been rewatching the show again as I havent done a full rewatch since probably . I think you bring up some interesting points OP  though I do have to disagree. I think your main issue stems from what you thought Vince Gilligans pointmessagetheme etc. was going to be and what he wanted the show to be about at its core. Walter White by all accounts and purposes was a broken man at the beginning of this show. He lacked confidence ambition and a sort of masculine bravado if you will. I dont think the point of his character was to constantly question his morality as Vince Gilligan explained he wanted to take Mr. Chips to Scarface. Breaking Bad isnt the story of a man making extreme sacrifices for family or turning to illegal activity to sustain them. This is about a man who goes down a path of repairing what he probably felt deep down to be an irreparably broken ego and sense of self. He definitely goes down this path for the sake of his family but even as early as season  we begin to see just how much Walter begins to enjoy breaking bad. I know some of other people have touched on this already but keep in mind that Walter absolutely did not have to break bad to pay for his treatment. While it would have shattered his ego even further to accept Elliot and Gretchens money he could have avoided going down this dark path. In fact his major driving force to break bad again is when he views the offer from those two as sympathy money so again... we find his ego playing a significant role in his desire to walk the outlaw path. We can see more of his ego playing roles in his decision making as time goes on but again we can even find it in season one. He tells Jesse something along the lines of Were going to make a high quality product that works as advertises suggesting that he will care a little about what he is making. Walter even goes on to answer Skylars question of Why was this so good? in reference to them getting it on in the car outsideafter the parent teacher conference with Because its illegal. We can definitely see his desire to a more powerful man and have respect in how he told Skyler that he took down Gus. It wasnt Were safe now our family is fine. he said I won. and this again proves to me by this point he definitely wasnt it in for his family alone anymore. He was in it because he enjoyed this. He loved the power he commanded the respect he was earning the fear he was instilling in those going against him. Back to season one in the first episode even  Walter is explaining to his class what the study of chemistry is. Change. is what he says explaining Growth Decay and then Transformation. He grew old into Walter White developed cancer which decayed that man and he transformed into Heisenberg. Even more support of the decay is when he literally kills himself in that first episode. There is no bullet that goes in his head but Walter White pulls the trigger on that gun and Walter White dies whether he was aware of it or not. ,breakingbad,d19t2nq,1,t5_2rlw4

7190617,0,t3_4dw8t0,I mean I felt for Hank but I also disagreed that he kept his integrity intact. He didnt do the exact same things that Walt did but he was on the right path. Using Jessie like a disposable tool is still manipulation.It was weird when I watched it a few years ago I quite disliked Jessies outburst but this rerun I found myself understanding him more. The number one rule of thumb is no rats. But I guess his number one rule was no children. I dont think Jessie wouldve intentionally gone to rat them out but Hank caught him at an extremely emotional and unfortunate moment fortunate for Hank though.,breakingbad,d1vig8s,3,t5_2rlw4

I think I still give the nod to BCS.But BB didnt really start getting crazy good until season .  BBs mid and endpoints were amazing thats what makes the show not the first couple of seasons.

7404226,0,t3_4gn38a,Even though obviously this scene on the surface is a talk about Walts cancer I think also its very much about the futility Walt feels in what he feels to be his mediocre life. In many ways Walts midlife crisis is a stronger and more terrible force in his view than his cancer though it takes his cancer to come for him to realise just how dissatisfied and restless he feels. He is just marking time  he is frustrated at not doing anything meaningful with his life. This is the crux of his character and the reason he continues to stay in the meth business after his cancer recedes.,breakingbad,d2jt8kv,4,t5_2rlw4

7576572,0,t1_d32tfg0,Glad to prove your assumptions false now suicidedelete your post like the last guy.The new agreement will bring a episode final season to the series...Vince Gilligan doesnt have a contract beyond this season.Then after the contract was signed Vince Gilligan I think an argument could be made that the end of episode  of season  is in essence everything  but one thing perhaps  that we promised the viewer or implied to the viewer from day one which is the idea of taking Mr. Chips and turning him into Scarface. Walt is pretty much as bad as one could imagine at the end of episode . There are two big questions left wanting for answers one is what is the state of Walts cancer and the other is what about Hank? Will Hank ever figure out who Walter White truly is? Those would be the only really for my money big questions left outstanding. If for some reason a meteor hit the earth or something and then episode  was the last episode we were ever gonna do  I would feel pretty good except for those two being the only outstanding questionsAndI have to say that this season finale almost felt like a series finale with all of the story lines that it appears to wrap up. Was that by design?Vince Gilligan That is on purpose. We werent sure that we would have a fifth season when we were plotting out the end of Season . So we wanted to make the end of Season  as satisfying and as complete as possible not knowing what the future would hold. Having said that there are a couple of big outstanding questions still in play. But I agree with you if the show had not gone on past the end of Season   although Im very happy to say that it indeed will  but if it werent to go forward I think I could be satisfied on some level by that episode.And The shows future at AMC if Im remembering the timeline right was still in open question during the production of this season. So were you working towards something that could have worked as a series finale in a worst case scenario and did you also have to work with the idea in mind that there could have been multiple seasons after this one?Vince Gilligan Yes exactly. Right on all accounts. I tend to  Im pretty neurotic and somewhat negative as a personality type and I  while most of the time I dont think it helps me in my daytoday life I think thats one area where I benefit from being that is when I think in terms of how much longer will the television show go on and to that end should I give just in case season four is the last season we ever do should I give the audience as much of a proper ending as possible. And the answer is always yes.Also always mentioned is once there was a new contract they had no clue where to go with S beyond answering about Hank and Walts cancer. Have you started to think about how youre going to end this whole series?Vince Gilligan I am not thinking about it as hard as I should be perhaps right now. And later on in the season when were fighting for time and trying to meet our deadlines Im probably going to look back at this time here in early October and wish I had worked harder. Right now Im kinda taking it easy. But the writers room will open up in midNovember and at that point my six writers and myself will sit down together and get to work and figure out where were going from here.Like I said nowhere to go but down they were backed into a corner by the success of S and the backlash of glorifying a meth cook. ,breakingbad,d33f4ab,0,t5_2rlw4
7581032,0,t3_4j5ou5,None of these are ever answered but if I had to guess I would assume they were a kind of easteuropean mob that didnt fuck around considering how much Lydia was worried about them not getting what she promised them after Walt leaves the business.As far as what they did after Walter died and  Jesse was free and the production of blue meth stopped is anyones guess. I suppose its possible they may have tried to replicate the blue meth in some way but I think Vince really tries to imply that only Walter and Jesse are capable of cooking meth with that high of purity. So if I had to guess I would say that they just accepted the loss and went back to their previous ways of making money.They could have possibly wanted to find Jesse afterall the money they could potentially make off of Blue Sky would certainly be worth the time and resources granted they could afford to send people into the U.S. and track him down. I think its unlikely though and personally I doubt they knew who actually made the blue meth. Itd be too risky for too many people to know just incase someone got arrested and spilled the beans.Like I said before none of these questions are ever answered in BrBa and this is all speculation from my end. While its possible that these questions could be explored in Better Call Saul I wouldnt hold my breath. ,breakingbad,d33xcxs,1,t5_2rlw4

Its just very unlikely that there will be an issue because most working devices dont have problems that the ground would prevent.As to the scene Walt was using the hot and neutral so the arcing is fairly realistic its just that if the circuit was properly protected the arc would have caused the protecting device to kill the circuit meaning it would have lasted a fraction of a second.

8713771,0,t1_d6tukkd,gtJanes embarrassment over letting Jesse meet her dad and then her reaction towards Jesse over it showed me a lot.  Her dad really didnt seem bad at all and he seemed disappointed as well that his daughter didnt introduce him to Jesse whenever they were talking about it at lunch after the AA meeting.  She didnt introduce them because her father is generally very concerned with allowing her to hang out with those types of people who for instance go to the tattoo shop she works at. And for good reason hes worrying about her falling back into old habits which of course is exactly what happens.  Jesse is very obviously one of those people he does not clean up well or have a good poker face or make a good first impression. As soon as her father started poking around hed probably also find out that Jane is renting him an apartment despite the lack of any legitimate source of income which is incredibly shady.  In general her fathers rather controlling and its not surprising that this would lead to friction between the two of them or that shed hide her sketchy drug dealer boyfriend from him. Of course he has good reasons for being that way and we see from Jesses parents that the handsoff tough love approach doesnt necessarily work out any better. So I dont really blame him there are no easy answers and sometimes no good answers to dealing with a loved one suffering from addiction.,breakingbad,d6uuxbi,1,t5_2rlw4

8818895,0,t1_d77mv5h,Man there are some F fans out there who can answer this question much better than I can but here goes...Okay lets start with my favorite Doom story ever which ironically is a parody comic made by uHartbrakonusA huge fan favorite is Doom  but I always liked my Doom much better as a straight up bad guy rather than an antihero. I even wrote a post about it way back when.For the best Doom as bad guy material I think you can look no further than Jon Hickmans stuff. Now Hickman has been known to imbue Doom with a sympathetic side but s Secret Wars casts ol Victor in the role he was born to play a psychotic God King with absolute dominion over the Marvel Universe. He revels in his megalomania he enslaves heros and villains alike he kicks a fuck ton of ass and he spouts some unforgettable oneliners along the way. SW was listed on dorkly.coms Doom favorites at  though I think its relative recency is a part of this and history will bear it out as one of Dooms all time best roles in the MU.Dr Doom is the quintessential idea of the brilliant misanthrope who believes in is sure of the fact that the universe would be a better place with him running things absolutely. And the coolest thing about Marvel is that we actually get to see that happen from time to time.Also Doom FUCKING HATES Reed Richards. Its his undoing over and over and over again. His obsession with F is as disturbing as it is entertaining and hes constantly devising increasingly creative ways to stick it to them. This hatred has taken him all over the universe but the craziest one has to be when he went through Hell and fashioned armor from his former lovers flesh and yeah its as awesome as it soundsSo to address your specific question Doom is an amazing character... that has incredibly never been properly adapted from the page. I think this is because he demands a shit ton of context and examination. Hes BIG character with a BIG personality who does BIG shit. Squeezing him into a supporting role in a  minute popcorn flick is a grave injustice.There have been a couple of cartoons that have been a bit more on the mark but nothing that captures the gravity of his role in the MU.Admittedly though Im not as up on Doom and F as I probably should be. So I think Ill let this ELI post from a while back take it from here,breakingbad,d77wsuu,5,t5_2rlw4

Hank probably wouldnt have lost his job especially since he was not ASAC at that time. It wouldnt have looked good for him but the shit wouldnt be very deep. gtWell no. At no point did he decide to sell meth to provide for his family.True but the family wouldnt necessarily know that. gtand no things would not just be okay if Walt headed off to jail for meth manufacturing and multiple murders. At that point if I am remembering correctly the body count by Walt was C Emilio and the two street dealers that killed Combo. Unless Walt confessed no reason he would be charged with those murders and he might not have even been questioned about them. C and Emilo were simply MIA as far as the cops knew and not sure there would have been a connection made to the two street dealers. gtYou could arrest Walt in the season  finale and the kids would still be fucked up for life.Because daddy manufactured meth they would be fucked up for life? Doubtful. Holly would be too young to remember much and Walt Jr was with his dad until Hank got killed. Lots of kids have dads that went to prison and still grew up just fine.The real problem of Skyler turning Walt in would be most likely Gus would off him to make sure he doesnt talk. ,breakingbad,d8bntuu,1,t5_2rlw4

10385911,0,t3_5opbzh,The only action Walt made that indisputably made things worse for himself besides saving Jesse from the dealers was drunkenly prompting Hank to consider that Gale was a protege not the master.  If he hadnt done that Hank would not have become a threat to Gus and Walt and his family might have been able to live out their days peacefully once Jesse replaced him as long as Jesse refused to abide by Walt being killed.Beyond that Im not sure Walt needlessly escalated the situation at any point during Season .  I think Gus recognized partially how volatile and dangerous he was after he killed Gale and would always have moved to replace him with the more easilycontrolled Jesse.  I dont know that his efforts to goad Mike into helping him off Gus or showing up at Guss house with lethal intent influenced Guss actions any because I think Gus would have assumed Walt would try to kill him at some point regardless.,breakingbad,dclb2ww,1,t5_2rlw4

Though that particular situation also speaks volumes about how careless Walt and Jesse were     Wouldnt say Marie is an airhead though  shes a Radiologic Technician and dual big household earner though we rarely hear about her job. She does often display an erratic immature personality though and during S I really think her only insightful moment was agreeing with Walt when he wanted to refuse cancer treatment which showed her character had hidden depth,breakingbad,dcwq0pr,3,t5_2rlw4

Omg another thing   When Jesse is on top of the ladder and Walt is about to spill the truth about Jane he literally just about to say that he watched her die Jesse says Just hold on to it! Will you just hold on to it? And then Walt is silenced    There is a double meaning Jesse tells Walt to keep a tight hold on the ladder it could kill him if he fell.  It can more abstractly be interpreted as Jesse telling Walt to keep hold of the truth it could kill him to find out,breakingbad,dejg3wl,2,t5_2rlw4

11729501,0,t1_dgp9gjv,So here we are. I just got finished talking to someone who adamantly defends skyler The only thing she ever did wrong was smoking while pregnant. That conversation strangely feels just like this one. Over generalizations and bias instead of obvious nuance.Youve been posting on this subreddit for years and thats great. You obviously care about the show but its pretty clear that your years of arguing with skyler apologists has jaded you from conceding anything other than skyler literally hitler.I went to SE and watched. As I suspected watching the episode gives more context that strengthens the point I was making. First and Ill repeat it since you didnt acknowledge it last time Walt is a human adult. Walter has had the freedom to ignore skylers requests since the very beginning and has on many occasions. Why isnt skyler responsible for all the things she wanted Walt to do but he didnt do? It is disingenuous to cherry pick a situation where walt AGREES with skyler and then blame skyler for suggesting the idea. Again Walter is responsible for his actions... skyler is NOT responsible for walters actions.Second Walter was in the wrong here. He wanted to turn himself in and for what? By this point isnt it safe to assume that if walter turned himself in and hid the money that skyler would never be able to use it? How would she be able to spend almost any money with the feds surveying her? Walter had literally just collapsed from exhaustion the scene prior and he was still completely out of it in the scene you screencapped. Walters suggestions was idiotic and a desperate attempt to end the situation with hank and to my surprise Skyler was the one who brought him to his senses. I didnt think that I would view Skyler in a better light after this but here we are.,breakingbad,dgpkigg,2,t5_2rlw4
11763959,1,t1_dgtg5ce,Breaking Bad is full of slow episodes and often they come in a row and then an awesome action packed episode will suck you right back in.  To me I remember the Fly episode came right at the end of a run of slow episodes and was particularly slow itself.
