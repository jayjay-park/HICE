814981,0,t1_cgoi8f8,Maybe  Ill check it out. Thats surprising to me. Cant someone just burn the CD and get the whole thing for free?Because of Typhoon Haiyan Pimsleur released the first unit of Tagalog i.e.  lessons for free and someone linked it in a post a while back so I have that. But thats cool to know that a library would have all the lessons amp units.,Tagalog,cgwx0ma,1,t5_2t8bg

5414067,0,t1_cw3fl54,I second Pimsleur. Ive completed the first  lessons or so and nothing helps proper pronunciation than the forced repetition and recall that this program provides.Way better than Rosetta.,Tagalog,cw3pfcy,2,t5_2t8bg

6509241,0,t3_44sm6w,Nope there isnt. Not for nouns at least. For adjectives reduplication does it as in maliitliit means somewhat small. But you cant really do that with nouns in the same way.,Tagalog,czslsv1,2,t5_2t8bg
6991699,0,t1_d16uf2h,Glad I could help. Another great resource that I forgot to mention is SBS Radio  Its an Australian based podcast for Filipinos. Unfortunately most of the content is targeted at Filipinos living in Australia and some of the podcasts will be in English only. But its a great source of quality Tagalog podcasts and new podcasts are uploaded daily.,Tagalog,d18uo47,1,t5_2t8bg

11454661,0,t3_63h278,As the other people pointed out lots of people understand basic English here in the Philippines.  But to answer your question it will be VERY difficult to learn Tagalog in  hours. Stick to the basics and what would be useful when asking questions.  On that note here are a few key phrases you will probably have use for along with their Tagalog counterpart.  Where is place?  Saan ang place?  Left  Kaliwa  Right  Kanan  Is that rightcorrect?  Tama ba?  Wrong  Mali  No  Hindi  Yes  Oo  Please verb  Pakiany verb can be used on English words as well example Pakiexplain  please explain  How much?  Magkano?  Thanks  Salamat,Tagalog,dfudll8,7,t5_2t8bg
11720522,0,t1_dgo915t,Oh I get it. The stop after kami made me thing they were two different sentences.  And the last two parts is it Oh Philippines. Why are you like that?? I dont understand this though. Is it a reference to the fact that Japanese people repaired it quickly while Filipinos take lots of time?,Tagalog,dgojsnv,1,t5_2t8bg
