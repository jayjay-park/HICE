2068728,0,t3_2d6z82,IMO the best Stones albums are Aftermath Between The Buttons Beggars Banquet Let It Bleed Sticky Fingers Exile On Main St. and Goats Head Soup.  I also own Some Girls but I find it sounds a little bland compared to the others Ive listed. My personal favorite is still Let It Bleed.I would recommend going on YouTube and listening to some of their music before deciding to buy full albums.  If you do decide to go on and get full albums and you decide you want it on CD then I highly recommend the newest remasters for the pre albums and the Virgin CDs for the post albums they are mastered a LOT better than the currently available Universal discs.  My opinion is that The Rolling Stones really shine on vinyl too.But great music.  I considered buying Satanic Majestys Request but not sure if I want to pay  for the CD or pay  for the . version.  I think after I pay SampH I might as well just save a few bucks and get the . one.,rollingstones,cl2s4a8,1,t5_2sbbq
