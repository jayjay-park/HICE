66636,0,t1_cem08mg,Well as for data limitsThis clearly states GB GB and GB data limits for their various plans. It also mentions that if your service is suspended for going over these limits you can have you service reinstated after six months if you ask. How nice of them. I was also mistaken. Its  times in  months not  times in  year before suspension and they will contact you the first time you go over no mention about contacting you subsequent times during the th month period nor of contact beforeafter suspension nor if the  months is a block of time or a rolling period of time starting from your first infraction. Ill amend my original comment. As for downtime I lived on Moana and Lakeside sorta south end out in east Sparks and up just north of UNR my current residence. So three widely different areas at least one of which is more or less in the middle of Reno. And at all three locations I had massive downtime all the time. It was crazy. So I guess I got unlucky? But honestly it was  years of constant downtime over multiple locations with over  dozen different modems used. So I dont really think it was unlucky.EDIT I too know people whove never had a problem with them. But I also know tons of people sitting in the same boat as me. Yeah my new speeds with ATT suck and I am not saving much money though I am saving a little. But its worth it to have internet that never ever goes down. I think Ive had less than  hours of total downtime in the  years Ive been with ATT. The sucker just NEVER dies.,Reno,cem0llf,2,t5_2qsfi

Was supposed to be there between  pm got here at . Certainly better than charter. The install went smoothly minus one hiccup caused by charter. He has to drill a hole in my wall through cement to run the cord because charter decided to take the cord that direct tv had originally run and put their crap on it when they set up my internet and phone.

1151678,0,t1_chz1mox,From the article cited in the petition.gt Its design would blend preservation with new construction. For example from the south the facility would maintain the historic look of campus by carrying forward exterior architectural characteristics of Lincoln Hall such as the entrance porch dormers andor cupola. However the interior of the entire building is proposed to be new construction.  To make way for the project White Pine Hall would be removed completely and Lincoln Hall would be removed other than architectural characteristics as described above.I really dont think they are going to completely destroy it. Looks more like they wanted to seismically retrofit it but it would have been cheaper to gut it and redo the interior with an extension on the north side of the building.,Reno,chz6f7q,6,t5_2qsfi

However if a mental health professional has determined that you are not safe to own a gun I do believe they should be allowed to put a temporary hold on your ability to own a gun.As far as online buyers guns cant be shipped to anyone that is not an licensed dealer or manufacturer. If they buy it online and it gets shipped to a local dealer the dealer will do a background check. If he buys it online and meets the seller in person then thats a private party sale and no background check has to be done.Like it or not the right to own a gun is an amendment just like freedom of speech.

2750835,0,t3_2rkni4,Which one at Atlantis? I would personally suggests the Steak House at Harrahs. It can get real pricey real quick so if youre not trying to go too big it may not be the best option. Its my favorite true straightshooter SH though. They also do a early bird thing for like  from  IIRC.You cant really go wrong with Sterling. Its pretty awesome good steaks as well if you want surf and turf its awesome. As for a few other options and some outside of casinos if you dont want to deal with them sorry if my links are mobile Im on my phone! SeafoodRapscallionswebsite A personal favorite. Very reminiscent of old school Upscale SF seafood places Think Scomas. Dark atmosphere but not necessarily super quiet due to very friendly staff and usually a lovely bar. Great bar in fact great drinks. Seafood specials are kinda the way to go but they also have good pastas and classic dishes. Ichiban Tepanyaki restaurant so not a traditional steakhouse but very good for both land and sea. Can definitely be a fun experience but if youre looking for something a little more private this wont be for you. If you guys want to have a more upbeat dinner try some new stuff and meet some people this would. Be a fine option. More hereSteakTraditionalBricks website here Ive always looked at bricks as the Landbased counterpart to rapscallions. Smaller more intimate atmosphere with a somewhat lively bar Amazing wine list. Menu is a tad small but everything on it is amazing like  amazing. If its in season maybe too early? the Abalone appetizer is super recommended. It can be super pricey and it can also be super reasonable. Definitely has a few fish items but mostly land great steaks and sometimes things like Buffalo and Elk. th St Bistro This place is awesome and tucked away in a remote part of town. If you dont want to deal with loud casinos or traffic this is probably your best spot. French food but has great filet if you really want that steak. Also recommend the Duck.
