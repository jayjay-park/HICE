9179682,0,t3_55ylfo,We all know that chassis setup is a bit of a black art because its hard to tell whether youre at the top or bottom of the bell curve for the part youre adjusting.  Is there something really subtle Im missing that would help make that determination?It came up in rforza the other day when talking tire pressures...which on the extremes if the telemetry is available virtual racers dont always get all the good stuff could be sussed out with an accurate enough pyrometer or by checking wear but with less information available is there a better way about it than I went up that made it worse so go down instead?,theartofracing,d8flb8n,2,t5_3dcdj
9329281,0,t3_589byi,Rollover from last week    gtIgnore my flair this is about circuit racing.Im looking for advice formulas excel sheets anything that I can use to learn more about improving my skills at developing a practice program to then determine the best tire strategy for a race. Ive found this from McLaren and Im working on using that but Im interested in the entire process how real teams get those fuel numbers etc.  by usplendidtree,theartofracing,d8yjyxk,2,t5_3dcdj
10588347,0,t1_dd6wpld,Amen to that...having FFB or a Gforce meter on screen helps a little but Id much rather be able to feel with my guts and my feet and my hands what the cars trying to tell me.Though to be honest I prefer a little tight...like Button its all about that stable predictable rear end that can be planted with authority when its time to get back on it.  I can drive around a misbehavingdamaged nose all day but a badly behaved badonkadonk is my kryptonite.  It reduces the cars potential a little but brings my total race pace up and keeps me nice and consistent.  ,theartofracing,dd83ush,1,t5_3dcdj
