2550852,0,t1_cmp25ik,THIS.  Student loan repayment up to k was touted as a benefit at my job.  I get onsite start asking around to the younger people and the response was dont even bother.  I dig deeper and yeah...its a crock. You have to have a very specific major and even then they have to be at risk of losing you to a civilian agency.  If youre looking to jump to another fed they wont pay it to keep you since they are not allowed to compete with other agencies.  It was pretty misleading.,fednews,cmrj81n,2,t5_2xy8z

6757577,0,t3_47wqr3,I would do some research into High Deductible Health Plans with Health Savings Accounts. HSAs are a significant tax benefit. Unlike the TSP or an IRA HSAs are taxfree at both ends  you fund them with pretax dollars avoiding even payroll taxes if you fund them with a payroll deduction dont pay any taxes when you withdraw them if theyre used for healthrelated expenses which we all have plenty of eventually and investments in an HSA grow taxfree. Anything you dont use for health expenses becomes a regular IRA after  although even then Id suggest saving it for health expenses. The current limit is  for an individual  for a family pretax dollars. I think an HDHP wHSA is a generally a good deal for anyone who has very low or very high health expenses. Its probably a bad deal if your spending is around what the deductible is. I used Aetna previously but there are other options.,fednews,d0iag9t,2,t5_2xy8z
10457370,0,t1_dctfsc9,Thank you for sharing this.Key pointsgt The head of any executive department or agency may exempt from the hiring freeze any positions that it deems necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities.Didnt see anything about public health. Maybe thats covered under a clause near the end.gt Within  days of the date of this memorandum the Director of the Office of Management and Budget OMB in consultation with the Director of OPM shall recommend a longterm plan to reduce the size of the Federal Governments workforce through attrition. This order shall expire upon implementation of the OMB plan.... so a minimum of  days which is to come up with the plan. It only expires once that plan has been implemented!gt Contracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted.That is unexpected.,fednews,dctg4kg,6,t5_2xy8z

10460293,0,t1_dcpqst0,Youre a jackass. Pension?! Are you kidding me? I do a k just like everyone else and the contributions are way less than my nongovernment friends...Do you want to talk about benefits? I had better benefits as a  per hour construction worker then I do in the federal government.  Like that other guy I too am highly educated but make tens of thousands less the my civilian counterparts.,fednews,dcts3gc,1,t5_2xy8z

I have a list of things that he has done to humiliate me in front of others. Also can depressionanxiety be considered a reasonable accommodation?,fednews,ddd2du7,2,t5_2xy8z
11078484,0,t3_5y58zk,As for the freeze impacting me. I had  offers on the table all were cancelled. For my Org. a few exemptions have been sumbitted all of which were related to positions with delayed EODs. Pathways wasnt impacted so we have been trying to fill the gap with students.As for what to expect..the general expectation in my org is that the OPM guidance will be the typical  hire for every  vacancies which allows for a lot of play especially if it is on a FTE basis. However the looming potential  reduction along with the rumors of a plan to reorganize portions of the govt is creating a lot of worry..If the vacancies are filled there will be a lot less wiggle room to meet the mark. I can say for a fact that at least where I am due to the fact that any major staffing reductions will really hurt... there will be signifcant cuts to travel. Training and performance bonuses are currently being discussed.There is also a concern over a the potential sudden forced shift to shared service providers. ,fednews,denqi97,2,t5_2xy8z
