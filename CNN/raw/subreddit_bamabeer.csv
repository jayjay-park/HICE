1976118,0,t1_ckr0fly,I feel you I spent a recent weekend working on my American made vehicle with Craftsman tools.Source of manufacture is a big point of decision for me when making purchases. It adds another point of satisfaction to the already pleasant experience of drinking a Bama brew.I should take this opportunity to say that I posted this title intact from the source with no alteration. It doesnt reflect my personal viewpoint.,bamabeer,ckrblub,2,t5_32b9r

5177791,0,t1_cv9s5m0,I went there a bunch when I lived in Calera in Hoover now. I agree it is small but the selection is rather excellent and the owner loves talking beer! Where I am now downtown is closer than where Country Grocery is.I can still make it downtown relatively easy just think a devoted HooverVestavia based store would work in the right location.,bamabeer,cva43n0,2,t5_32b9r

5973965,0,t3_3x5gtl,Maybe they should focus on quality control before they start canning.  Just a thought.,bamabeer,cy2puyt,3,t5_32b9r

6367675,0,t1_czddnk8,It was good and different from the regular Olde Ale. Im not sure what I expected but it wasnt mind blowing. Id definitely drink it again. ,bamabeer,czdfnuh,1,t5_32b9r

8109438,0,t1_d4renua,I think its a bit less crisp than the StA heffe but that might have been due to many factors past the canning point. I doubt that I could pick them out of a blind taste test. If you like one youd probably like the other in my opinion. ,bamabeer,d4rknwb,2,t5_32b9r
