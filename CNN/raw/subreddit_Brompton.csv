428542,0,t1_cfp6ic6,Well shoot now I just feel like a fool. Thanks for catching that and pointing it out.,Brompton,cfp6mam,1,t5_2tmfb
1612194,0,t1_cjictms,I purchased the bike from a retailer so it was brand spanking new when I got it! I always feel a bit bad when it gets dirty after a ride and try to take care of it as much as I can. Im hoping itll bring me many years if not decades of cycling. I havent got any pictures on me right now but I can snap a few when I leave work tonight!,Brompton,cjidtx9,1,t5_2tmfb
2017771,0,t3_2ht90y,I have a  Brompton and done around  miles on it  never had a problem with my pedals apart from striking the ground during high speed cornering  scary and I cycle it flat out. How old is your Brompton?,Brompton,ckwc6eo,1,t5_2tmfb
3340484,0,t3_2yewf7,Not from SF. But I travel there a bunch. Try asking this shop. They carry bromptons you can buy out the door. Sure they would know if something existed. ,Brompton,cp91ft7,2,t5_2tmfb
6229265,0,t1_cyxp33d,In my country it is actually quite normal to leave all bikes on the street if you dont have space seeing as most household members have at least  bike each. The space you need in a normal sized family can be quite large and not everyone has access to a shed or hallway.ampnbspNow with all the bad weather we have I really dont have the time to dry of the brompton everyday. If I get a new one I might think about this some more.,Brompton,cyxp7ak,2,t5_2tmfb
8935303,0,t1_d7lppzh,Thanks. I have a M which I feel is a bit on the heavy side to carry which was why I was interested in the titanium buts but I guess its not worth it.In hindsight I kind of wish I had gotten a speed for the reduced weight since I feel that even the speed struggles on anything but the most mild hills so I tend to avoid them as much as possible.Although when I was test carrying the speed bike at the store it felt light enough heh.,Brompton,d7lw3jm,1,t5_2tmfb

10221101,0,t3_5m99x7,Im not sure if its possible to build an electric bike that is compact lightweight and reasonably priced I feel thats on of those pick  out of  situations and I guess the electric Brompton will not be cheap. This might not be that bad because the electric bikes people ride are already quite expensive.,Brompton,dc2mam2,2,t5_2tmfb
10954173,0,t3_5vxf35,Unless you are building a massively modified one then almost certainly not. And even then its a lot easier to build a custom if you start from a complete bike plus brand new Brompton bits fetch decent prices.... especially in view of all the recent upgrades theyve had.,Brompton,de9ufkn,1,t5_2tmfb
