5219543,0,t1_cvehv9u,Yep unfortunately open toratopes dont have as direct of a conversion method as the closed. But they still follow a simple pattern. They use the cartesian product which multiplies whole solid objects together rather than the nD surfaces. These solid shapes are prisms with curved sides and a sharp edges. For an nD object the sides are nD  and the edge is nD. The spherate operator is when you empty out the nD surface cells which will leave behind just the skeletal nD edge. Then expand the skelet with a smaller shape in every point usually a circle which inflates the frame into a toroidal ring of some kind.  Take two objects such as two solid disks diskxy and diskzw. In toratope notation this is IIII as xyzw . The terms for each diskdiskxy  xy diskzw  zw If we want to multiply them together M x N  we can use the format|M  N|  |M  N|  awhere M  xy and N  zw  which makes|xy  zw|  |xy  zw|  aa D prism called the duocylinder. If we wanted to spherate the duocylinder add an additional pair of parentheses around the two circles  IIII. This means to empty out the D cells and expand the clifford torus with a smaller circle in every point denoted by the new outer brackets. Mathematically we take the  solid disk terms and use the formatM a  N b  cThis will define a product of the two solid circles by just their hollowed out surface by setting M gt M a  and N gt N b  where agtb  altb  and ab. xy gt xy a  zw gt zw byieldingxy a  zw b  cIf we wanted to define just the nD edge wed set the minor diameter c    leaving the product of two orthogonal disk edgesxy a  zw b  So in general for a two parameter toratope consisting of MN or MNClosed Toratope   M a  N b  cOpen Toratope  |M  N|  |M  N|  aThis method even works when you multiply a solid ring torus with a solid disk IIIII . The resulting D shape can also be constructed two other waysnonbisecting sweeping of a duocylinder into D  IIII gt IIIIIbisecting spin of a torus prism around the plane of the torus into D  IIII gt IIIII,mathpics,cvf5awo,1,t5_2sf1t
