4975701,0,t3_39v1gk,First thing if your sister is  end of discussion! Dont go there dont fuck that dont even accidentally brush against her tits in a narrow hallway. Incest is complicated enough and people who are  can barely handle simple socially acceptable sex.But for the sake of argument lets say youre both something.In that case Id say it depends on how you your sister and your girlfriend feel. In our society no incest relationship can ever be a real romance youll never take her on dates or get married and if you get into a sexual relationship with a sister thinking you can be IN love with her rather than just love and fuck her then youre an idiot headed for heartbreak and disaster. If you guys can be family and have a friend type relationship and somehow work fucking into that great. If you think your sister can be your girlfriend I pity you.So if you accept that a sister that you fuck can only ever be a sister and friend... and youve got a girlfriend who knows about that and is OK with that knowing your sister can never replace her then no problem.If your girlfriend knows about it but considers it cheating then yeah youre cheating. If youre fucking your girlfriend and your sister on the side and they both dont know about each other then youre also cheating.,incest_relationships,culq2w2,1,t5_2xfpv

I had to leave my thoughts on stuff like this out because the post was already super long but yes I can see us in a serious relationship despite the complications. A few years back I thought it was just a sexual attraction which is why I left it alone to blow over and didnt flirt with her at all. As we got to know each other better I realized how much we had in common  at times it felt like I was talking to a female version of myself. Even though weve spent most of our lives apart we were very well synced.I realize that I may have accidentally portrayed her as a ditzy immature girl after seeing MrsPervyPants reply but focusing on her flirtingpossible rejections left out the warm thoughtful intelligent person behind those actions. If anything the silly sense of humor we share is funny because were normally serious people. We both agreed that ditzy girls are really annoying actually.

I do bet you cannot find a person born from family incest who says they wish they were dead even if their lives are very painful. This makes me think that incest is especially awful when it ends this way. Human beings would rationalize anything...hence the need for pre commitment.Also no one complains about the millions of deformed and dead babies born without any incest that were preventable. Its weird how this works.,incest_relationships,cwff8dr,1,t5_2xfpv
5700363,0,t3_3swkm8,Others have suggested talking to your brother.  I disagree.  Just approach your mom like any woman you would like to romance.  Ask her out for lunch or dinner bring her presents do things for her and tell her how nice she looks etc.  Slowly but surely try to seduce her.  If she responds then fine if not then let it go.  But respect her and her privacy.  Who she has slept with is none of your business including your brother.   whether she is interested in you is all you want to know and the only way to do that properly is to respectfully and honestly try to find out.  If you are nice and respectful even if she ultimately tells you no she will probably do it nicely and without injuring your family relationship. ,incest_relationships,cx3oojx,1,t5_2xfpv

I am her safe harbour the one she goes to and I think itd be horrible if shed lose this. She has already been through a whole lot and there arent many people to help her through this.  I can live with whatever consequences this might have for me although there is nothing I want less than to lose what we two have.  I love being that close to her but the only thing important to me right now is how she feels about this what she wants and to make sure she feels safe and knows everything is okay between us at least from my side no matter what actually happened and what her feelings might be.I havent thought much about my side of things. I dont think my side is too important on this issue either. To me its just all about her and how she feels.  There is some guilt about having enjoyed it but then again its kind of natural to enjoy such a situation even if she is my sister. I mean she is really really cute we get along insanely well and there is still a lot more I could list. If Id start to talk about what I like about her and how great she is Id just end up rambling on and on about it.  So there is really not a lot of guilt I guess and its second to my other worries in this situation anyway.,incest_relationships,cye5y6x,3,t5_2xfpv

6758812,0,t3_487tpy,A lot depends on your exact situation your AGES your family situation your parents your background and so on.  You mention a sister in uni.  Thats an  odd way to put it for an American.  Most Americans would say once my sister gets out of college.  But at least it means that all of you are adults.  That helps.There is a thread up the stack in which I asked people the best way to do exactly what you are saying you wish to do.  The best answer was from a brother and sister who had been living together for fifteen years.  They severed all ties with family moved as far away as possible with no forwarding address and USED A LAWYER to change their names get new identification new credit cards new bank accounts etc.  The lawyer does not need to know that the three of you are together.  Id say do it separately and use different attorneys.  The girls can tell their lawyers that they are trying to hide from an abusive father or something.  The one thing you cannot change is your Social Security Number.  You can legally change your name on the card but the number remains the same which means of course that anybody who really wanted to track you could do so.In my opinion the best situation would be to hide in plain sight.  Have the oldest or most independent sibling go to the target city as far away from Mom and Dad as possiblehow about France?  Or Spain?  and obtain a place to live big enough for everyone in a city with a university.  Get a job settle in.  Then the next two siblings move there because of the great job opportunities or to get an advanced degree.  Were just living together to save money and for convenience sake.  The problem with this is that Mom and Dad may want to come visit.If you all disappear without a trace your family is almost certain to start searching for you.  Thats why I recommend moving to a country where incestuous relationships are not illegal.  If you are in France or Spain even if they find you figure it out and pitch a fit they cannot have you arrested.  Of course you probably would never be able to return to the U.S. while they are alive.  Alternatively if you really want to just disappear go to Mexico on vacation then depart for Spain or Argentina or Paraguay or somewhere from there leaving no forwarding address.  The idea is to leave no paper trail.Most people just dont care that much about other peoples living arrangements.  As long as the three of you dont go around telling everybody you are in a triad and an incestuous one at that they probably would never figure it out unless you are tripletstwinsetc. that look alike or something.All of this international travel requires a lot of money.  If you chose to go off the radar in the U.S. there are plenty of ways to do it.  Research The Slabs in the desert outside of Niland CA.  Its pretty much No Mans Land.  Keep your private business to yourself and nobody is going to ask you much of anything.  There is an entire subculture of people in the U.S. who have no I.D. and are untraceable but they live on a rather low economic level.,incest_relationships,d0if1pm,3,t5_2xfpv

7257236,0,t1_d20ewb0,In other words all of those relationships have fallen short of this ideal you have carved in your mind.It doesnt happen overnight. Among the people you know there might already be someone with whom you could have all that youve dreamed of and you dont have much of a shared history with them now but you could create one. You cant turn the clock back but you still have this future that you can make something of if you dont squander your present on regrets about the past. The price is colossal investments of hard work creativity and worst of all time with no guarantee of success. Of course this is not as convenient as the perfect love story of having always had a builtin best friend and realizing that your soulmate had always been just a room away but unfortunately the tough reality is that life doesnt always hand us everything out on a silver platter.,incest_relationships,d233gyc,2,t5_2xfpv

Its almost as if she expected this type of relationship with you on the basis that she loves you. What is confusing is how old she is. Usually girls rule out their father as crushes around .  My advice is that she definitely needs her mother to explain that this is inappropriate both how and why. At this point you trying to explain this to your her will incite more embarrassment and a defense mechanism i.e distance.

I do have sexual videos of myself on my computer and my daughter did find them recently.What you are going through is understandable. I recognize my daughter as an attractive human female but I get flashes of her childhood and taking care of her which become an instant turn off for me. Ill be the first to admit if someone blurred my daughters face in a sex video I would probably be masturbating without thinking about it. If I realized it was her Id probably suddenly feel sick about it. It is the connection and relationship I have with her that causes that reaction. You are just responding to a male body you find attractive because of instinct and hormones it isnt anything to be ashamed of. It takes a while to come to terms with but I guarantee it never stops being awkward as fuck.Just do things with your dad that reinforce your nonsexual relationship with him and dont let yourself snoop on him again that is if you want to get rid of these thoughts about him.,incest_relationships,d4gbhqk,14,t5_2xfpv

Maybe she does want the affection of a man and she looked for it with you. But you also said that it was awkward when you both came to senses mumbled something and walked out. So neither one of you knows what the other one wants or thinks. I really think she wants affection and also the benefits from it but it is up to you to make her convinced that you can handle this. At that point it would have been really awkward if instead of saying she wanted affection she would say that she was horny and wanted to give someone a bj and picked her son.,incest_relationships,d4v58yc,1,t5_2xfpv

Dont try to seduce him and dont try to coerce him. Make sure that isnt your intention but tell him that you need to explain what has been going through your head. If you cant get some time with him one on one I would suggest not trying to push it since he probably wants to keep it all in the past. I really recommend a therapist. If you are worried about legal ramifications you can lie and your brother was a close friend of the family around your age or even a cousin if cousin marriage is legal in your state. It is really good that you are getting this off your chest. A lot of us here are willing to help but we arent trained and licensed professionals.I am sure your brother hasnt intended to hurt you. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt my sister when I broke things off with her. It was disrupting my life and interfering with my growth from a teenager into a man and I needed to move on from her. We are better as a siblings but it took years to get there. It took a very good guy a man much better than myself becoming her boyfriend to help her get to that point with me she confided her past to him and he pushed us to reconcile because he had lost a sister to cystic fibrosis and didnt want my sister to lose me in her life.

9507135,0,t3_5azt96,I think you were getting some good advice over there the best thing to do is probably to confront him over it and ask him pointblank what it is he thinks hes doing.if nothing else hes invading your privacy and acting like a creep so its worth putting a stop to that.,incest_relationships,d9kygra,2,t5_2xfpv
9539825,0,t3_5azt96,I think the main thing for you to consider is what you want out of this. While it sounds pretty obvious what he wants anything you decide to do has to be careful so you arent doing anything you dont want in case your relationship with him as a mother suffers all because of a single mistake. If youre unsure as to whether you want anything with him Id recommend just talking with him. A lot of people shy away from that because its so overt but its honestly the best way to find out what he wants and if youre still unsure you could base what you want off his response. Ask things like if hes attracted to the idea of incest or specifically you whether this is just the result of not having a girlfriend or a longlasting attraction like you suspect. The thing is to not make him feel uncomfortable. Youre his mother and he should feel at ease around you so if you do talk make sure you come across as understanding and loving. Coming across angry when he will feel most vulnerable may really damage the relationship between the two of you. On the other hand if you know what you want to get out of this sexually Id recommend dropping similar hints to him. The situation with the porn video was admittedly pretty smart on his part but you could do something similar. Maybe ask him to search something on you phone while youre busy and have the internet open to a similar porn video. Since youre pretty sure hes going through your toys and panties maybe leave something special out for him. Perhaps you could buy a new toy and leave it specially for him to find. If you wanted to be really obvious you could even leave a note with them asking for him to clean them up after he does whatever he does. But like I said before the most important thing is to figure out what you want and what will be best for the two of you. As much as I and some other people might being saying just fuck him these kind of situations are much more delicate than that. First and foremost you are his mother. I hope whatever you do wont harm things between the two of you. Good luck. ,incest_relationships,d9ozcvf,3,t5_2xfpv
9636789,0,t3_5cw385,Maybe ask her why she told your parents about the messages rather than just talking to you? Be sure she understands you arent cross with her for making the decision she did but that you felt a bit hurt..Work you way up to that point maybe ,incest_relationships,da0xltn,1,t5_2xfpv

9743173,0,t1_dacpv5a,I can only suggest that you work diligently to keep your relationship from prying eyes.  Depending on where you live there may be legal issues to your relationship as well as having your mother catch on.The worst of all possible scenarios is getting exposed causing family problems only to have the relationship end leaving you pretty much totally screwed and not in a good way.Im not trying to be a negative Nancy.  Just be careful.,incest_relationships,dae23yg,1,t5_2xfpv
9789124,0,t3_5ent9m,I agree with a poster you should most definitely have said this in person and after you had built up your relationship with her.This could come off as very creepy and unnerving.How she reacts to this is all on her as a person.Give it some time and see if she replies. If she doesnt do NOT send her another message. GO and see her face to face when you know shell be at home and talk it out then.,incest_relationships,dajq0jb,3,t5_2xfpv

10461206,0,t3_5poabb,I dont think you would be able to be FWB just because you say it is only lust. Lets face it after you did it then you would feel great. But then you would get butterflies in your stomach when you realize that he is related to you and the family bond means you can trust him to be there for you. Your mind will be racing you will get confused and you will continue having sex and fall for him but you will be angry that you fell for him. The song I hate that I love you will apply here.,incest_relationships,dctvu2q,1,t5_2xfpv
10520503,0,t3_5ncmt1,Id say if this is all happening in front of you youre probably being paranoid dude. Sounds normal to me  Id be more concerned if she dressed conservatively around him or there was any sneaky behaviour sounds like its all going on in front of you. Maybe you have a few issues you need to look into if you havent really had a positive father figure in your life. ,incest_relationships,dd0m2eq,1,t5_2xfpv

10771186,0,t1_ddqiehf,However if his porn history indicated that it was all gay sex only for the last month or so you might be on to something. But even then since he is still young it could just be his frusration with female relationships.That happened to me when I was younger.,incest_relationships,ddqyvbs,2,t5_2xfpv
11186084,0,t3_5znt67,I honestly had this happen with my aunt too... I confessed to her that I would fantasize about her at night and I having hardcore sex and she replied hours later with shock.. She did admit I looked handsome but things grew worser a few days when again I admitted to her that I wanted to send her a pic of my dick. I didnt say dick but she immediately knew what I meant and now were just not talking at all... Sometimes I wish I just had one night with her man.. ,incest_relationships,dezxh3x,1,t5_2xfpv
