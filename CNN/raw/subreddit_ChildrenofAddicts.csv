7799803,0,t3_4jvbvv,First off I am so sorry about everything with your mom. Secondly dealing with a loved one and trips to hospitals is annoying. Sometimes the person cannot control their body due to health problems like accidents and we have to be there to help. It makes sense that you are emotionally run dry and want something in return. Only had one parent as an addict and it was bad I cannot imagine having both you are quite strong. Never have met your mother but I think you are right she does love you. Love is something people give for free and nothing in return. Maybe she isnt very good at showing you that you are loved but I do believe people can truly mean it. Sucks about your moms husband being distant but alcoholism is a beast affecting everyone different. Try to be patient with your parents while trying to focus on your life and your happiness. Stuff like this gets better with time and the more you deal with it I think. Wish I could tell you more to help you but I wish you many hugs and fountains of luck.,ChildrenofAddicts,d3srbq8,2,t5_3431z
