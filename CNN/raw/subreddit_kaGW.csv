3064392,0,t1_cocza7i,Shamelessly plugging my story as it fits into these themes! Here Its more on teasing and denial so far but well get some restraining in time. Would love CampC and to talk over plot and scenes and also since Im commissioning multiple pieces of art for each chapter suggestions on that side are welcome. ,kaGW,cofmdnc,1,t5_32hiz
3082154,0,t1_cohehjv,Thanks so much for your thoughtful response!I understand what youre saying about chapter  and its the second comment I got about the decided change of tone.  It was a difficult stretch for me to get through because I wanted to accomplish several things.  For my target audience theyve probably watched the last  minutes of the finale dozens of times so environmental descriptions didnt feel important in the first two chapters.  But this was a transition to the spirit world and I wanted to try and sink the reader into the new setting as much as possible give them the lushness its synergy with Korra.  I also wanted to use it to make allusions to the moon as it relates to Korras birth element waterbending rebirth that sort of thing.  I also had some endgame about where I wanted them to end up so I tried to work them through the first half of that chapter as quickly as I could.  I thought of adding dialog but nothing fit or contributed.  So I had to paint the picture and get them to destination as quickly as possible.  And yeah then I needed to go through Korras thoughts before I got to character interactions.  So I can appreciate the critique surrounding that it might have seemed a bit long getting to the goods.I get the observation about Korras introspections how they might seem a bit long or might not be for everybody.  But introspection is one of my major focuses overall in this story.  These characters mean a great deal to me and I really wanted to get into their heads extract their thoughts their inner demons their excitement and concerns over this blossoming new aspect of their relationship and make others feel the hurt the love frustration and everything in between with them.  I actually wasnt  sure about whether I should explicitly write about their first time making love or not when I set out on writing this even though the setting of the story was leading directly to total consummation of their romantic love.  I didnt want to cheapen the psychological exploration I was trying to get at.  But as I got to the end of chapter  it was obvious that it was right to take the final steps with them that it would  be a beautiful culmination to their ruminations if I could execute it properly.  And so I set to it trying to render it as artfully tastefully yet as lustfully as I could make it.Anyway again thank you so much for your critiques and compliments!  These are the sorts of things that make aspiring writers really improve their game!,kaGW,cohgow4,2,t5_32hiz
