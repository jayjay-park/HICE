The motorsport scene is pretty hypermasculine at the best of times  percent dudes in all areas grid girls a general fondness for using the phrases good old days and political correctness gone mad so its really encouraging to see a proactive move like this. Sports and LGBTQI havent mixed well in the past. People refuse to believe the reality that there are gay drivers out there who feel like they have to hide who they are in order to be accepted. I cannot imagine how horrible it would be to feel like you might potentially lose your job over who you are as a person.
