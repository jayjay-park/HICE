1601952,0,t3_2cmgsg,Ive never even heard of this guy. Probably for good reason. He is seems to be saying just what others are complaining about not to say that he is wrong.I do agree that SE has lost sight of some of the simplicity that made its games beautiful. I was turned off by his approach on the matter but he isnt wrong. I think the batman was cool looking but then again thats it. Sure FF looked cool as well as the other FF games but were they good? Yeah I liked   and  well enough but I couldnt play . I wanted to. I really did. I wanted to finish the trilogy but the time limit combined with the confusing story I couldnt figure out what to do. I couldnt take my time to take it all in to enjoy the city to learn what it had to offer. I was being rushed by this doom. Like hell I was going to be rushed through an entire RPG. So I put it down.IDK maybe you guys loved FF great. Im jealous you could enjoy it. I wish I could.,SquareEnix,cjh3fmw,2,t5_2sj5h
3055415,0,t3_2v5sns,FF was a classic in its day...Im just waiting to see what XV will bring!  XIII was a smite repetitive and XIII was a bit short.  XIV is the best of the moderns so far.,SquareEnix,coeowwm,1,t5_2sj5h

9943479,0,t1_db0udcx,I already have a copy of the game which is why I wanted to return mine. I decided to also preorder from Amazon for their DLC and was just going to cancel the SE copy but it was too late. I figured Id just return it. sighI was going to try to return it to Amazon so I could possibly get some money back but the swap might work out too as I could still do a return to Amazon for damaged merch. Since I was trying to get rid of this SE copy its still sealed. I havent checked for scratches or anything and the plastic sleeve seems to fit fine judging from how it is sealed anyway. Im willing to do this as long as this can happen relatively quickly. ,SquareEnix,db3nr3f,1,t5_2sj5h
