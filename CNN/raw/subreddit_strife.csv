The objectives of StrifeLife are as follows   Create an environment where players can discuss various aspects of the game including but not limited to heroes pets items competitions patches etc.  Help players find teamsgroups to play with. We really enjoy the competitive side of Strife and we feel that even though it is only CBT it is never too early to start meeting likeminded players to build a team for competitions.  It is only early in our development process but we wanted to open our doors to help build the competitive scene by allowing players to meet and interact outside of the game. We encourage anyone interested to signup today!   If you are not in CBT yet we still encourage you to signup. We believe our community will help ease the transition into Strife and we are open to any questions.,strife,cf9u3c0,1,t5_2ttrn

418765,0,t1_cfo5vya,A game shouldnt require you to type in chat and wait for an answer in order to perform a successful gank. Some opportunities dont last long enough for people to stop moving just to type an answer.As for your other point. Watch a pro Dota  player stream they dont spend the entire game asking questions to their allies. They look at allies status by themselves saving time and being more efficient. They also have enough map awareness to see when someone is ganking to see when an ally has ultimate. It all means that they can do things quicker themselves than stopping everything theyre doing to ask a teammate a question in the heat of battle. You lose efficiency by requiring to ask teammates more questions which makes it easier to miss opportunities. You guys probably all like it here because most people who dont like Strife just leave and dont participate to the community. Putting the game aside for better ones.,strife,cfo65lf,1,t5_2ttrn

429825,0,t1_cfpb720,I would still highly suggest that you have Ultimate indicators on when it on cooldown ready or out of mana.The other three skills I dont care about it because while a good skill can be a impact of the fight most fight engagements are about the proper ultimates.  Removing that information creates this weird disjoint to the player especially a new one.  Not to mention premades will have a HUGE advantage over lone wolves because they will communicate when their ultimates are ready while the lone wolf cannot communicate excluding chat which should be the last source of communication tbh ,strife,cfpbeh5,0,t5_2ttrn

535766,0,t1_cg0v4iu,I totally agree with you when you say Mobas are more than any other game about adapting to a situation and making the best out of it. Theres no need to reduce that as much as possible. so yeah you can play with normal items that fit the situation that works currently for me. But then why is my ennemy who has made a mistake in itemizing as he went for his usual build rewarded with additional stats while it is obvious he just went for the items he crafted without thinking completely ignoring the fact thatMobas are more than any other game about adapting to a situation and making the best out of it? why did he get rewarded for not playing as a good moba player while i didnt?about the cap where you can progress with skill and not the item you need.. well winning a game is about a lot of factor. skillstimingpositionning is one. Choosing good items is another. there are ppls good at reacting quickly some other know the perfect item for the situation. and there are some that are good at both and these are the good players. you cant say that a moba is just about being good in the thick of the action. So if you dont encourage players to pick their items accordingly because of a system that compensate them with additional stats for not thinking well that becomes less and less a moba. And you completely lose a depth in skills in the pro scene which i think is big part of a moba. moreover if you have the best itemization possible but you are shitty in positioning you will lose no matter what. you need the appropriate skill and positionnong that suits the items you picked of course. so yeah servers may have trouble with the  crafted items in a game but simply put a limit of like  to prevent ppl from trolling and thats all. If a player is able to have so many items and still choose the good one even while hes paying attention to his laning etc.. then theres no problem with that. if other people are having trouble with their crafted items because they are numerous allow them to bring smaller pools of items if they want but dont just stop good players from having creativity just because others cant.,strife,cg168zs,1,t5_2ttrn

If I had four slots I wont put it in because its a situational item therefore I am  efficient instead of  with my item slots.By having unlimited slots at least I can pull it out if the situation arises therefore creating value for situational items.

898525,0,t1_ch6e501,I think another part of the problem was the fact that all other Tier  items were pretty underwhelming. They are basically a component with little bit more stats. You couldnt really mix them either if you wanted to have a more balanced approach you either have to go ALL mana regen or ALL power or ALL health regen etc. Healing Rod was so good because it gave you some sustain and some effective health and mana regen.When I play games now I like that I dont have an automatic pick up in healing rod but I dont really like my other choices. I always feel like I want to find a more balanced approach but none such option exists. If I go Fel Blade I feel really vulnerable if I go Enduring Helm I feel like Im always out of Mana if I go Glacial Gem I feel like I get harassed out of the lane too easily.

Dont run across map to take it.its very push heavy. applying pressure on towers at pretty much all times keeps the enemy team on edge and opens up opportunities for the bosses and forces the enemy to forfit a lot of gold if you keep the lanes shoved if they are team fighting frequently as a groupstarter heroes are probably going to be the most forgiving heroes. Ray is pretty easy so long as you can land his stuns. You can go springboots if you want that extra survivability if not cooldown boots are quite strong on him as well as power for extra burst. Rook is a pretty strong solo and fairly forgiving with his invul and hook recommended items is def viable just dont blindly follow it. It serves as a general build path that you should in time know how to move out of while keeping some of the suggestions. The only troll bait recommended items is vamp dagger with vermillion.   lane set up for baldir and because mid is easy to gank from its often advised you send your ganker middle to roam after you shove into tower.  see . dont really rotate to baldir its just a nice alternative early game when tower pushes are sort of difficult given the low sustain you have and fast timers for respawn. as late game approaches it loses its importancefocus as a important objective. ,strife,chmdx1v,1,t5_2ttrn

Max Dragon Claw next usually but it depends.Pet Topps for power and slow Tortus for extra tankiness or Pincer for extra tankiness and an extra CC purgeCore items . Elder Stone of Heritage with two Clarity Shards because she is constantly starving for mana. Inertia Boots. Dampening Cloak either enchantment is good here OR Golden Protector of Adaptation depending on enemy team. Everwinter Charm no enchantment. Giants Visage of RestorationOptional items. Iceforged Plate either enchantment is good. Guardian Helm either enchantment is good. Hexbane of Restraint. Seers Eye of Diligence. Windrush of Diligence. Inferno Brand  I dont tend to pick this up since her ult does the same thing basically but a lot of people get it anywayYou should focus on helping your teammates secure kills. Use Dragons Reach to catch escaping enemies pull them out of their towers range split them up in a team fight or pull them away from a teammate the possibilities are endless. Use Scale Shield on allies who are fleeing from a chasing enemy or before they dive into tower range. You should have enough health to not have to use Scale Shield on yourself.

1376189,0,t3_29v59m,Im sure I wont be the only person to say this but I dont agree with your emphasis on building attack speed especially to the degree you do. I see how with Demon Fang that can stack up to be a lot of damage but you are sacrificing survivability on a hero that is supposed to be a tank. Obviously you know this but thats why you have to go with all of the extra move speed since you probably have trouble with sustain with your build and you need to get out quickly.Dont get me wrong I think that if youre going to build attack speed Shank thats the right way to go except Im surprised you didnt get an Everwinter Charm!!

Simply click the components tab which is right by the consumables tab at the top of the shop.From there you can tick off which components you have bought or might want to buy and it will tell you what items those can build into.This method though isnt ideal. The shop tabs are arranged into categories of items magic damage attack damage etc. and from those tabs they are arranged by price of recipe builds. Components are utterly worthless if you arent building up to an item you have in mind which is why it helps a lot to just plan your build by dragging your build onto the load bar or loading a saved build at the start of the match.,strife,ck4grdu,1,t5_2ttrn

1794206,0,t3_2f2k3e,Let me help you out to the best of my ability. Adc is typically sent top with a supporttank Tanky Fetter is an option but usually the only hard defense I recommend building on him would be stoneskin. Fervor Boots gt Demon Fang gt Zealots blade power aspd Stoneskin gt Crushing Macecan be built earlier if needed late game you can build woundsplitter but Giants Visage is not bad if you need the extra tankyness.   Rook is usually best build with raw powerdamage with an exception to  item. Power boots gt Demon Fang gt Woundsplitter gt either crushing macepoweraspd zealots bladepoweraspd or void keyof power Verm is the master of positioning. With a long attack range and a disengage as a stun he can escape sticky situations. With that being said its very important to stay in the back behind your team most of the time. You will get owned by casters typically. Fervor boots gt Demon Fang gt Zealots blade gt Crushing mace gt  Harrower can be build as an adc and ran in the top lane. He also can work mid potentially and bot. Stoneskin is a very good item on him as well as demon fang. Some also like mystic dagger a lot. Im not a harrower expert so I cant give you an exact build. Caprice is not really an adc. She is much better at being an assassincaster Jumping in killing getting out. Some good items on Caprice are Power BootsMystic DaggerCrystalline Shiv Grimoire Power conduit even zealots with power potentially. Bounder is the most used pet for ADC especially if ran top. If you throw the adc bot I would recommend pincer.Add me in game if you have any more questions ever want to play.SG Lakota,strife,ck5b50h,3,t5_2ttrn

1853404,0,t3_2fsnc3,Cool suggestions. I was surprised by the one about observatories but I think I agree. Since its so simple to take them you can run in snatch one and since you see that the enemy had control over it immediately get back out. The jungle is small enough and everyone has enough movement options that even if the enemy were in the area theres no way theyll be able to pay you back before you are gone especially since you know they know you were there.This is just a thought but what if you didnt actually steal the observatory but instead always keep it for the full duration and dont see whether the other team also has vision. Therefore both sides can have vision over the same area and neither knows whether the other does. This could make it easier to punish someone grabbing the observatory and make grabbing the observatory or even just moving through the jungle more risky since you dont know whether the other team has vision. Alternatively you know they have vision over the area but they can see which way you go to get back out so they can plan an ambush. It could make observatories too powerful or less interesting just a thought.,strife,ckcj41b,2,t5_2ttrn

2011900,0,t1_ckvjj9x,gt  armor items shouldnt go on lowhealth heroesI  disagree. Armor items are extremely good on low health heroes when built with hp as they give much needed survivability on an otherwise instantly killed hero. Theres no reason to have power if you dont have the HP to use it. I oftentimes get IceforgedGuardianImmortal Gaze on heroes that are power based because of the hp. The one hero I wouldnt get any of those on are Carter because his skills make it so that you try and stay as far away as possible.That being said I agree with every other point. Elder Stone is wonderful for the low price and high amount of hpmana it gives Pyrostaffs scaling makes it basically a fifth skill on any high powered hero Vamp is a midlate game item. Tangent aside people dont like builds that go against their given notion of a hero. Most Rays just build flat power and use OOC for regen. Im not saying thats a good idea but thats what usually happens.However if you got Pyrostaff as your secondthird item including boots then its not very good as your currently low power would mean you used an item slot on something that could be increasing your overall damage by  as opposed to . Also Mystic Dagger is a very hero specific item. Few people can make good use of it Fetter Minerva as stopping to auto attack between skills is usually something you dont want to do unless you do it anyways. ,strife,ckvmq3k,-1,t5_2ttrn

He had no reason to call us noobs or type profanities about peoples mothers etc because he intentionally ruined the game and didnt have MVP for most of the match. He was calling people noobs well before we started losing anyway.It is really pointless to insult your teammates. I can understand frustration it happens to me too but losing your temper and insulting your team achieves nothing. Its not like anyone is even going to care what you said when the match ends so its a complete waste of time for you and for your team.,strife,cmntad4,1,t5_2ttrn
2536928,0,t1_cmpncis,The video isnt a good play. I kinda think you didnt predict anything mostly because you walked away from where your q would hit before realizing that he was gonna rocket into it but even if it was a prediction its a fairly standard one and you still didnt chase it immediately.Anytime you claud hook anyone who has any escape even if youre just using q for damage which I still think you were you aim it in the direction they would use their escape to get as far from you and as close to safety on the offchance they continue to rundashjump in that direction. Making it a highlight and adding music is pretty uncalled for imho.Still you do you this is just my opinion on things I dont mean to discourage you from making strife content.,strife,cmppnuj,1,t5_2ttrn
2540762,0,t1_cmp6j90,Youre right panda. I left that line in until now because its true that we did get our start  months ago by stream sniping every now and then to spread our name a bit and it is indeed true that we were very excited at the time by those victories because a few of us were very new to the game at that time! I had only played a few weeks at that point so to win against pro players felt really good! Which is why I left that in to be faithful to our beginnings. But I have now removed that line from our About page because it is no longer relevant and hasnt been relevant for a long time. Cant even remember the last time weve stream sniped and Ive never thought myself to be better than any of the people weve sniped and beat. because Im not!

3662345,0,t3_32bffo,I wouldnt say strife has less depth and complexity than LOL. id agree that dota  with its ability to steal cs from the opponent through hitting your own guys and some other mechanics make it more complex.But a lot of the things strife changes dont make it more complex they do make it less punishing of mistakes to a degree like the amount of out of combat healing. But this to me is like the couriers which dota has lol doesnt Its just about taking away from forcing you to pointlessly go back just for the sake of going back basically.You can still bully a lane opponent into backing or he doesnt and last hits but stays super low health and isnt a threat and could at any time risk being killed in a dive or healing under tower but taking so long he might as well have gone to back and walked back.I would argue being able to customize items makes items more complex and the lack of recipes building into recipes items makes it less linear. In LOL for example champions can rise and fall with items. If Infinity Edge rises over bloodthrister if the new cindara jungle item is better than the others it makes those champs that can best utilize it op and sometimes its the passive or active but often its just the raw stats. Crit chance  AD etc that really matter the passive or active is just a perk. In strife recipes focus on the active or passive and the stats are pretty much whatever you want for any item and through that you can also counter the meta.If in strife all in ads rise to the top other ads and supports can build the counter into every item they build to a degree something you cant do in League I can counter some new damge over time mage or attack speed AD Flavor of the month champ in strife by getting midigation in every single item but still have the same passives and actives I enjoy just trading out some power for midigation.,strife,cq9qdj1,1,t5_2ttrn

Since the Baldir changes a good team should be able to quickly finish a game. In solo queue the trouble I find is getting team mates to get to baldir any time before midgame. IMHO by  minutes  baldirs should be a given. Sadly usually the first baldir is at about that time.

3978622,0,t3_360p5g,I agree with some of your points about balance and eventually would like to see S be in a position to support their own competitive scene but I also disagree that everyone wants to play a moba to be competitive on a league or championship match level. I just want to play a game that I enjoy and get better at it and take it for what it is. The ladder system provides something to ultimately work for at the moment but I dont even get how it works. What satisfies me is a fun game and having more fun games winning a match and getting recognized for playing a good game by my friends or just my own satisfaction in improving. I dont think all games need to be ultimately motivated by organised play. At the end of the day its just an online game. I sometimes just want to play a fun challenging online game against human opponents  and thats that. Thats just me. edit Seems like WolfJoe also said what im feeling. also i dont agree a good game makes people want to play the game  create tournaments  attract outside sponsors I sometimes feel like a neglected demographic. I dont just play games because theyre popular or backed by a giant brand. I play games that are good  and I hope enough people agree with me that theyll play those games too. Unfortunately we seem to be living in a world where quality often goes unappreciated  games that I dont respect half as much as Strife have a lot of commercial success. Thats not to say they dont deserve it just that I dont want my games made to follow a popular model for popularitys sake which is whats happening with companies like Konami. Im a chef and we face this dilemma in our business  do we want to put burgers on the menu so well immediately become more popular within a certain demographic but could prevent upselling and turn off some customers? Or do we keep on serving more sophisticated dishes in hopes of securing a reputation that leads to future well paying customers and the retention of those that appreciate them? ,strife,cr9sobj,1,t5_2ttrn

4151264,0,t1_crt7sx7,I came back for a weekend when it was on steam. Got shit talked in  games for breaking meta. Decided I was done for good. Strife had a window of opportunity for me it passed. The game I played  years ago was sold to me as play heroes a variety of ways and builds in a friendly non toxic environment with varied and unique progression of pets and other features. They watered shit down so much since then its just a generic game now. Honestly the closest thing to what I looking for is now Vainglory.  ,strife,crtghww,3,t5_2ttrn

4272222,0,t1_cs75v0n,Wow you must sure have a lot of friends. Why are you even arguing this? What do you stand to gain except for some sort of bragging rights? Who honestly cares? You may continue to think what you want and I will continue to do the same.Classifying the majority of humans as stupid sure does seem a little excessive dont you think? Just because you hold a very strong opinion on something does not make it right.In any case Ive wasted enough time on this discussion. Have fun!,strife,cs773ae,3,t5_2ttrn

4381046,0,t1_csjethh,gt Theyre busy working on the game.Thats no excuse.gt This game was really well designed but poorly advertised and managed.Thats not the developers fault but it is the publishers fault. Since they are one and the same it is S Games fault.gtS going ghost mode just really makes it so hard to believe that this game will survive.Once again thats no excuse. If they have more than one game they should at least have a few people dedicated to maintaining each of their active games. One of those positions is a community manager which engages the community and gathers feedback from the player base. Other positions might include developers that continue to improve the game technical aspects and designersartists that continue to create heroes polish the UI etc. gt Theyre probably too busy working on the game which is why the subreddit is looking for a new mod whos able to communicate with the developers.From what I can tell the moderation this subreddits moderation team has nothing to do with S Games. Maybe they listen to them more than any individual user that posts here but they are NOT S Games employees.,strife,csjh9rz,6,t5_2ttrn

4549833,0,t1_ct448qo,Oh ok. Like I said we have different opinions on what a strategy moba is.gtIn all honesty there is also no point in comparing different games.Maybe you shouldnt have jumped on board a comment that was directly going into that then?gtThere are many people here who have played this game much longer than you. There is no point trying to lecture them on their skill cap when you probably couldnt beat them anyway.The my dad can beat up your dad you so Im right aspect. I hope to god that those players could beat if not that would just be pathetic lol,strife,ct44oyw,1,t5_2ttrn
4550019,0,t1_ct44ywe,The only thing that makes this game casual is the average skill level.That may sound retarded but the game would be much more competitive if more than  of the playerbase had decent decision making regarding objectives and a better understanding of concepts such as riskreward.The game itself is fine enough imo minus the fact tempra is uncleansable with second cd lolololol.,strife,ct45j9v,2,t5_2ttrn

4707783,0,t1_ctmjqtc,Also the people who made Savage known are now working for FBnot working for S Games anymore.This statement is incorrect.  The very small team that was involved in Savage still has  of its members at S Jesse Jason Bruce Adam and myself.  A majority of our staff has near or over  years of tenure with the company.FB is made up of mostly the talented amp passionate developers that maintained HoN while at S.  A majority of the core developers that created HoN from the beginning are still with S.We love Strife as much or more than many of you here.  However if it is not economically viable to continue to put significant development resources into the game we have to make difficult decisions.  We put a lot of sweat and dollars into both making and marketing Strife.  We made a bad guess on what the mass market wanted.  Lessons learned...Thank you for playing and enjoying our creation ,strife,ctnycqv,8,t5_2ttrn

5129541,0,t1_cv3f538,Many so far has failed to address the question...but at least you had the courtesy and intelligence to recognize it. The community response to this thread as well as the moderators decision has been disappointing to say the least. Its done nothing but perpetuate the fact that enough of these problems are real and of sufficient significance.  Report egregious toxicity? Good. But to who? How do we make it do something of value to fix the problem behaviour? Reporting to S has been a waste of time in the past. Should we report it elsewhere? How do we make a difference?
