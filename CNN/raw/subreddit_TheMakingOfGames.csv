HM is the exception not the rule. Successful people will always say in interviews follow your dreams and you will win at life but they leave out the part where you also have to be in the best . at what you do or have precisely the right connections.,TheMakingOfGames,crsrr0w,0,t5_2zlr1

5720432,0,t3_3tgzwu,Hiya herosjourneymythologThis is an interesting patent.  But as a raw page wall of text its not really appropriate for rTheMakingOfGames  If there was a more friendly overview article with a bit more context like this one  then I think it would be of interest to a lot of people.But as it is Im going to remove this post just in the interest of keeping the subreddits content consistent.  Sorry if this seems overly strict.  This subs charter is a bit fuzzy.  So I try pretty hard to keep it from wandering away from its focus.,TheMakingOfGames,cx66cev,1,t5_2zlr1
6626981,0,t3_46g3i4,For anyone new to Crowfall heres Crowfall IGN Wiki IMO best quick intro. Even shorter way to describe the game would be Game of thrones meets Eve Online or SWG crafting in Shadowbane both Todd Coleman and Raph Koster are in team.That video was taken from todays Massively OP interview and speaking of building  another interesting piece of info was revealed couple days ago  this controversial graph seems to suggest but only on first glance IMO that Crowfall players prefer building to fighting.Unrelated to building and already more than a month old anyway here are some January prealpha test videos Confessor ranged fire DPS and Knight warrior  tank PoW.,TheMakingOfGames,d04scc5,3,t5_2zlr1
