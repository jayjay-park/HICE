I agree that the destruction of humanity would have a good impact on the rest of the world we do a great deal of harm to it. I just dont think the world would be affected in any meaningful way if the panda ceased to exist. And thats why I asked Id love to be proved wrong. That is my point. There may not be a real existential truth or point to anything but I think there is certainly purpose. Unless you want to argue for futility and thats fine  cosmically everything is pointless  but here now on earth they dont serve much of a purpose. Pandas eat bamboo plenty of other animals eat bamboo too so it wont get over grown by their demise. They dont procreate very often so there are limited numbers of the dwindling more and more each year. They arent prey that I can think of and so serve no greater good in that respect. They have no utility. Thats my point. Now whether or not that gives them a point or makes their lives worth living etc... Im not really asking. I dont have an opinion one way or the other. I just dont see what all the fuss is about. ,Wildlife,cfupdff,1,t5_2r0qd
