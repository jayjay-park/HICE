920087,0,t1_ch8nqio,The answer to number  doesnt actually answer my question Im still unsure if I should be doing two sets per workout or one.,startbodyweight,ch8vbl3,1,t5_3154k
3631329,0,t1_cq5outx,Thanks for the tips and especially for clarifying all the correct terms for each grip and exercise. ,startbodyweight,cq6773x,1,t5_3154k
3996910,0,t1_crbs2kx,Thanks.  I could have used this info about  weeks ago but I noticed when I switched from eccentric pullups to top half pullups I couldnt really do them at all with the grip I was using.  Ive since put my workouts on hiatus while I refocus on cycling and weight loss.  When I start up this routine again Ill definitely be more focused on proper full range of motion and grip placement.,startbodyweight,crbvpa4,1,t5_3154k
4031125,0,t1_cre405j,More is not always better. The startbodyweight progression is designed to build strength whereas your running core routine appears more designed to build or maintain endurance.  I would advise against doing both since they work pretty much the identical muscle groups. I suggest that you give the startbodyweight progression a shot. Even if you eventually decide that you like the old plank routine better the strength training may give you a better base for endurance training. For example you may be be able to return your old rep scheme using harder plank variants resulting in a betterdeveloped core for endurance work. One thing you probably dont want to do if you would like to advance is to keep your old routine asis. One final note since this is something I was confused about when I started following this plank progression in case youre not already aware you only do one plank set per workout under the startbodyweight plan. ,startbodyweight,crfs26n,1,t5_3154k
5803782,0,t3_3um64m,Why do you need an alternative? A pull up bar is extremely useful and they are quite cheap when you consider the value of them. You could do rows or lat pulldowns but they generally require a gym. There are many progressive steps to the pull up exercise if you cant do a full one yet.

8772454,0,t3_5059z7,I think Nick said it bestgtIt is important to realize that the basic routine presented on this site consists of generic protocols and exercises designed to work for a majority of people. However it can be easily adapted to fit specific goals such as weight loss hypertrophy muscle gains maximizing strength gains or developing strengthendurance. It can be used in a circuit or as a form of High Intensity Interval Training HIIT it can also be adapted to be more sport specific with certain goals in mind.gtWhat is more there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to fitness just general parameters such as the ones presented here from which as individuals we are free to stray. Some people do not need rest days others will need more than one. Some people will see better hypertrophy results from doing sets of  than sets of ...,startbodyweight,d7281ev,2,t5_3154k
