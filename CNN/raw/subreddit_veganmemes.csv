684345,0,t3_208c6q,I agree. Do you have any idea how many poor defenseless moles golphers field micerabbits and birds are destroyed every harvest by giant harvesting machines? If youve ever eaten any produce you havent grown yourself then you share in the slaughter and maiming of millions of our tiny wildlife friends.  I recommend you stop eating anything ever again,veganmemes,cgi27m6,1,t5_30wk6
