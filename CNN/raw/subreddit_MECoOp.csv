252199,1,t3_1wzom6,A big HARD nerf to tactical cloak. For two main reasons Firstly having a power whose cooldown doesnt depend on weapon weight which can provides a damage bonus for ths of the time which allows other powers to be used on the same tiny cooldown which lets you drop aggro assuming you know how to use it and which provides the biggest damage boost in the game to both weapons and powers and a multiplicative damage boost in its sixth rank is frankly absurd. It also makes for very boring gameplay. With rare exception theres no reason to use a cooldown for any other power. By nerfing it we get to enjoy the hot salty tears of the filthy casuals in the first week of release.I favour removing entirely the multiplicative damage bonus requiring bonus power to use a power from cloak making you choose whether the bonus applies to powers or melee or weapons making the cooldown dependent on weapon weight again.After that the power can be buffed in various sensible ways.,MECoOp,cf6w83u,2,t5_2tkk1

1066833,0,t1_chphapc,The things that really annoy me when playing on Platinum tho... Expert players trying to use low level classes They have been playing the game forever have ridiculously high N ratings from all the times they reset their characters have all the rare guns on level  etc.  Then they wanna try to play Platinum with a level  Drell Adept or something.  Okay they probably have the skill to play on Platinum and they might not even die often becuase they know how to avoid damage.  But theyre such a low level character they cant really be an effective member of the team.  We will probably still win this match but at the cost of me having to use all of my consumables like ammo medigel and missiles when I normally dont need to use a lot of them.  If you wanna level up your characters play the appropriate difficulty.  The lone wolf  This might also be an expert player fully capable of handling themselves on Platinum and they may even be the one to carry the team to victory being the last one alive most of the time... except that the mere fact that they are on the team is the sole reason that they have to carry the team to begin with.  They play as an infiltrator usually so they can go invisible and not get shot then use that as an excuse to go roaming around the whole map leaving the team behind.  Except now that he is on the other side of the map the enemies are now spawning in all the wrong places such as right behind the rest of the team.  And of course someone will die then someone else will die trying to save the first person then after  medigels and  missiles we run away only to run into another mob of them that wouldnt normally exist and so we all die again.  So then I gotta sit there and watch for  min while this guy slowly takes out all the enemies  at time by himself.  Why didnt they just play a solo match?  The obvious noob They may come in with a fully level  character but they havent unlocked a single banner yet from challenges and their N rating is less than .  They use really common blue weapons like the Avenger and Predator which can sometimes work but not on Platinum and not when the gun is only level  and not with the current class they are using.  Automatic kick here they need to go pay their dues in bronze and silver first.  Starting public matches with only  or  players  I know they do this because I click on Quick Game and I get thrown right into the battle on wave .  Did someone quit already?  Not very likely since its  seconds into wave .  And if someone did quit then this is for them too...  Because now I am stuck in a Platinum match but I probably have all the wrong guns and gear if I have any gear at all because its much easier to equip all that stuff in the game lobby.  So now I gotta play my N engineer or Talon Merc without his  grenade bonus or my slowass Geth Jug without an Adrenaline Module or his shield amplifier or my soldier without any kind of ammo power or rail amp.  That or I may not even have a class that is viable in Platinum because I was just playing on a lower difficulty and again its just easier to change that stuff in the game lobby rather than the multiplayer menu. Then if you have some chatty players they will be all on your case about how much you suck because your score is so low and you keep dying constantly.  In these kinds of matches I refuse to use my consumables like Medigel and such so if I go down Im down.  That way it doesnt cost me anything but time.  They started a  man match well thats what theyre gonna get and Ill just go do something else and ride along for the credits however far they get.,MECoOp,chpjxoo,-3,t5_2tkk1

1649669,0,t3_2d8ib3,gt While viewing a weapon through the weapon selection menu does the damage bar indicate the damage a weapon does on a simple trigger pull or the damage it does on a full charge.I honestly dont know and I dont care. Dont bother using the bars in the ingame UI. Theyre horrendous no scale at all really? and theres much better sources of information out there.Use this instead or even just character builders like Kalence or Narida Ive linked the one uChypsylon hosted since the normal pytalhost one seems to go down often.For specifically comparing the Paladin and the Arc Pistol I would go with the Arc Pistol.The Arc Pistol can be charged up to deal more damage and fire additional shots. Basically if you charge it for any amount at all each round it fires deals x normal damage. When charged up to  second it fires three shots at once. Essentially the gun ends up doing x its normal damage for a total of  damage at I and  damage at X. The Paladin by comparison hits for  damage at I and  at X. Plus its UR so its a lot harder to get to X.I dont remember exactly what the clip size for the Arc Pistol is but I think you can squeeze out  charged shots  rounds before reloading the Paladin only has  rounds per clip.A further bonus in the Arc Pistols favor is that dealing damage with three rounds helps mitigate shield gate only one round will be affected whereas the Paladins one round can be stopped by shield gate.People really tend to underestimateundervalue the Arc Pistol.,MECoOp,cjn3rjg,11,t5_2tkk1

4386739,0,t1_csk3deh,Thats a straw man. There are very obviously other roles to be played than pure damage output. The novaguard obviously isnt good as a weapons platform.It isnt good at biotic explosions as it cannot set up its own and it can only set them off it theyre kissing the enemies ass and making themselves vulnerable. Not to mention that Charge and Nova have no BE bonuses and there are far better characters to spam Shockwave like basically all of them and better powers to spam than Shockwave biotic slash and smash. It isnt good at straight weapons damage. Charge Nova and Shockwave are all meh at doing straight damage especially to bosses where it is needed on gold and plat. Not to mention that the Slayer Drell and Asari all have better AoEs in nearly every regard when compared to Nova with Phase Disruptor and grenades respectively. They all have better range better radius better effective damage and they hurt shields less. The only cons are that PD doesnt set off biotic explosions and grenades are a resource. Its not very durable especially in situations where it needs to be durable like hacks because the durability is tied into iframes when charging and using nova which often requires them to leave the hack. It literally only functions well on gold and plat when paired with someone purposefully assisting with biotic setups and even then its shaky and not really any better than any class with aoe biotics or in the hands of someone very talented. Being good in one realistic situation is not the hallmark of a good class. ,MECoOp,csk4ekd,3,t5_2tkk1

Id be curious how youre avoiding the Prime stagger though is it through rolls andor Nova canceling?It sounds like youre pretty well equipped though so I really should just shut up and stop telling you more things that you already know.

5779251,0,t1_cxdg8qk,I should probably just wait for uEllairaJayd to chime in but assuming youre talking about the Human Vanguard or Novaguard in common parlance its a class that can easily do a ton of damage to large groups of enemies with protection  regardless of whether youre setting off combo explosions or not.You dont need particularly good equipment at all but the critical thing is taking the a evolution the top one for the th point on Nova.  This gives it a massive boost to damage against armor barriers and shields.Ive completed a Gold solo with the Novaguard and seen others do quite well with a variety of builds but my personal preference is this oneAny light weapon will work  you may not even shoot all that often depending on how power spammy youre comfortable with.  I prefer to take Half Blast on Nova  others may disagree but it despite its name it sacrifices very little damage just  of the base damage i.e. prior to bonuses allows you to use it twice for extra protectionbusting and gives you a lot more margin for error.Lastly you can shorten the Nova animation by executing a combat roll side dodge at the end of it  this also helps keep you alive.Speccing into Shockwave is completely optional and you cant really go wrong sticking those  points into more weapon damage I just like having it for situations where youre in a hack circle or dont want to approach a Banshee that hasnt gotten to a ramp yet for her to not be able to sync kill you.Id say just about every Vanguard is effective on Gold when played well.  The Krogan Vanguard and N Slayer in particular Id call out for being less gear dependent and capable in any situation.  I do find the Drell and Asari to be a bit more gear dependent though some may disagree  and for good reason as its really up to your playstyle and preferences.,MECoOp,cxdgy8c,2,t5_2tkk1

6369255,0,t3_42wafe,I learned a few things developing this that I think I should clarify In the past I have adamantly stated that you only have a . ultra rare drop chance if you have your rares maxed. This is false. It does not choose another pool if the one it chooses is empty it uses the backup pool. So maxing anything makes no difference to your chances of getting a different rarity. The ultra rare cards for Volus  and Collector Adept have a ! drop rate even less than the . for standard ultra rare weapons. I feel this used to be different at launch time as I got all  upgrades in about a day back then. One pool the silvergearmp is referenced as a  drop in some of the packs. This pool is empty. This effectively means you will use the backup pool for that card slots guaranteed if that pool is chosen. BioWare named a lot of weapon mods things like SniperRifleReloadSpeed and stuff which are actually things like thermal clip upgrades. They also have some constraint damage items which are things like ultralight materials. It seems they got changed late in the game and didnt get renamed. It made for a very confusing experience coding this. NHQ still show BF Soldier with his in game text. It threw me for a loop when it showed up on mine! But I fixed it they didnt  Your in pool chance for a card increases as you max out other cards in the same pool as it has less other cards to choose from.,MECoOp,czdm513,9,t5_2tkk1

6446361,0,t1_czlo50o,Hmm... So the Weight Glitch thing will stop extra weight being added on from certain mods but doesnt actually contribute to lowering the existing weight...  unfortunate. And also it may suddenly fix itself for reasons?Yknow... this reminds me of something else from the Single Player stuff. Ive done some messing around with the Gibbed editor and I noticed a few things.  Firstly that raising the level of weapons beyond the normal limit besides giving increasingly obscene amounts of clip capacity and damage will also push the weight into negative figures. It doesnt reduce the weight penalties of other weapons... but it DOES inverse the weight effect of mods. Putting Ultralight Materials on a super highlevel weapon actually makes it heavier while the  weight mods actually make it lighter at that level. Not really relevant to multiplayer I imagine but it effectively informed me of something interesting The higher the level of a weapon the less of an effect you get from using Ultralight Materials on it and conversely the less of a penalty the  weight mods presumably impose.,MECoOp,czm3e2g,1,t5_2tkk1

7091051,0,t1_d1k2cxf,Selfdetonation for Tech Bursts is generally underwhelming excluding Snap Freeze on Paladin.  With VH against lowertier enemies youre usually better off firing one power and firing your weapon to finish off an enemy rather than trying to create combos.    I think this is true even with really poor weapons.  Against heavy enemies Tech Bursts are far less helpful than Fire or Biotic Explosions.Energy Drain is so much better than Submission Net so Id take SE anyday over the VH.  VH just brings so little to the table.  Its not good for weapons DPS and while Incinerate is a great power its underwhelming without team synergy or a better paired power for Fire Explosions e.g. Overload on HE.

7146474,0,t3_4der8l,Part of MECoOps success is its single player background. The games have build up a massive fanbase and when those people where finally given an opportunity to play together to interact with each other and explore the variety of races and powers that Mass Effect always had but never gave us a chance to play around with those people went allin and never looked back. Sure there are many others who got this game just for the multiplayer or simply out of curiosity since EA marketed the hell out of ME. Theyre part of it too and Im glad they are.From what I understand the Division is an RPG shooter set in a more realistic environment. IMHO that doesnt work as well as a scifi setting or any other fantastic game reality. Theres also the fact that MECoOp has no PVP and thus has a much more friendly player base. Everyone gets the same experience the same amount of credits. Were all equal here. I dont think you get that in the Division. Also I have not played the Division but have watched reviews and know some things about the game and from what Ive heard...well its just seems to be mediocre generic. As much as I dislike ME compared to its predecessors it seems to be a far superior game at least thats what Im getting. Its unique.But Id buy the ps.

7152714,0,t1_d1r4c3b,Powers Keep Tech Armor and Annihilation Field on at all times of course. Annihilation Field I reset turn off and back on between every round so Im not caught out as often without it during the middle of a round. Warp is good for detonating enemies primed with Annihilation Field or your Incendiary Ammo or priming big bullet sponges so that they can be incendiary cheesed with the CSMG or Hurricane if you want to go that route.Guns Acolyte is the primary. Keep it charged all the time fire it whenever you see an enemy usually while youre running at said enemy. CSMGHurricane is for bosses and bullet sponges.Gameplay Early waves charge into spawns firing the Acolyte get in close and detonate Tech Armor. You can follow up with a heavy melee if you want it can help finish off survivors while staggering them giving you some damage reduction and giving you something to do during Tech Armors cooldown. As soon as its off cooldown turn it back on and cancel the animation with a light melee or dodge. Its not too hard to chain that kind of thing to keep a single captain or elite stagged  Tech Armor them light melee a couple times turn Tech Armor back on cancel with a light melee or two detonate Tech Armor again. You can also detonate Tech Armor gt Heavy Melee gt detonate Annihilation Field for triple area effect damage as long as there are no bosses or sync killers around.Pretty much most of the early waves youre going to be running at enemies and spawns detonating Tech Armor light meleeing and dodging and running around. Youre going to spend a lot of time exposed but youre not super tanky with this particular setup so youre going to spend a lot of time on shieldgate and healthgate. Spatial awareness and map knowledge are critical youll almost always want to have a corner handy you can duck around. Later waves andor when there are huge bosses around youll be spending more time in right hand advantage positions using Acolyte or CSMGHurricane with Warp for fire explosions or incendiary cheese. Still dont be afraid to run up to tougher units when they get low and finish them off with Tech Armor  its not very prudent but its fun and looks badass. The Geth Scanner is great because Tech Armors detonation goes through walls and cover just like Arc Grenades.Thats it basically! I was inspired by this video    It got me thinking about other kits with Tech Armor and I realized that the Valkyrie can get some of the highest Tech Armor detonation numbers as well as having amazing mobility and two other area of effect attacks. After that it was just a matter of throwing it together and playing it and I havent used any other spec on her since.

8979509,0,t3_5398k8,Wow thats a broad question. Im not sure whether your looking for helpful objective information or just personal opinions.Objective informationSome guns are just lousy. The shuriken for example has pathetic damage output and little redeeming value.Some guns arent terrible but are outclassed by similar weapons unlocked later. Why use the carnifex when you have a paladin? Why use a collector assault rifle when you have a harrier or lancer? Other guns like the mantis can hold their own even in the late game.Some guns are underappreciated by the community theres no consensus on which ones of course.  Some guns clearly stand out. The community generally agrees that the reegar hurricane and harrier are incredibly strong weapons.If you think the hornet is trash and dont find the saber worthwhile your understanding of the games weapons and their uses is lacking. You should read up on that. The college here is a good place to start.Personal opinionMy favorite form of discovering hidden gems is the weapon spreadsheet I scan the sheet for details that surprise me. For example I recently noticed that the incisor has excellent sustained damage output for its weight. The only drawback is recoil which makes it perfect for a turian. The turian sentinel has overload for stagger stability for burst headshots and tech armor for knocking back enemies that get to close. IMO most of the projectile weapons are underused. The kishock in particular. The damage to weight ratio is amazing. And its devastating with reload cancelling. It causes huge staggers. And its unaffected by shields armor and even a guardians shields. Its crippled by lag when offhost but onhost its a seriously underrated gun.Lastly the tempest. Yes its outclassed by the hurricane collector smg and punisher. But until you start unlocking rares and ultrarares its the highest damage fully automatic weapon and nearly the lightest. Its solid for any powerbased build and its decent for weapon platform builds with accuracystability improvements. Not many uncommons hold up at higher difficulties. We all love the mattock for that. The tempest deserves that love too.,MECoOp,d7r77op,5,t5_2tkk1

Also skiping Damage amp Capacity passive dosent seem like a good idea your trading  cooldown and  power damage that helps  both Ballistic Blades and Inferno Grenades deal more damage for . weapon damage.My build is pretty much what uBlackwoodJohnson described no Blade Armor points full fitness Piranha X.,MECoOp,d887559,3,t5_2tkk1

Even if you were trying to be the post was not so I asked for clarification and expansion. Because I already knew that the Destroyer makes any weapon better and I already knew that the Geth SMG is good on a Geth built for weapon damage.I also find the shoulder launcher on the Destroyer isnt worth the shield reduction it simply doesnt have the DPS for it. And putting the Viper or Incisor on the Destroyer also seems like a waste of time if nothing else then because he is one of the few classes to whom weapon weight doesnt really matter so light weapons that do low damage really dont fit him.As Ive said to some of the others I want all the builds to be moderately effective and I want to find at least one character for every weapon so giving the Destroyer all light weapons means less space for the really heavy ones among the other characters.As for the last part of your post I would appreciate it if you all would share some of your more unusual builds and weapon combinations because its the unusual ones that Im trying to find a good place for.

9913809,0,t1_dazqu63,No problem.Shockwave also has a target limit of  IIRC so after the first three targets it hits it will pass harmlessly through any further targets. I cant remember precisely whether Swarmers count as distinct targets but I think they do which is sometimes why Shockwave wont seem to hit anything behind if you have it pass over a damageddead Ravager with piles of Swarmers first.There are similar target limits on other wavelike powers such as ElectricBiotic Slash and Poison Strike as well as the asari heavy melee.I personally run my Shaman with a Wraith to have a punchier but still relatively lightweight weapon. I think its important to keep your loadout fairly light on the Shaman since for some reason he doesnt get the higherthannormal encumbrance the other krogans tend to get and he also has Barrier slowing down his powers. The power cooldown curve isnt linear so I try to stay at least above  or  or so. An Eviscerator is a good lowtier replacement if you dont have a Wraith or its low rank and thus heavier. Talon is good too.Acolyte  CSMG is also a great loadout that really emphasizes the caster role of the Shaman. While Acolyte may be more optimal on some krogans Soldier especially comes to mind they just look a little goofy IMO running around with such a small weapon tucked in on such a large frame.You may want to give Incendiary Ammo a try too. Shooting with Incendiary gt Warp gt Shockwave will result in a Fire Explosion followed by a Biotic Explosion. Very satisfying and great at putting down the midtier armored units quickly Brutes Scions etc.I guess this depends on your tolerance for Warp  Incendiary cheese though as the two have a glitched interaction which greatly increases the DoT of Incendiary Ammo. Some people frown upon it as taking advantage of a known exploit but as long as its not the primary focus of the build e.g. Incendiary Reegar on Shaman or Asari Valkyrie I personally dont mind it much.Just my couple of cents.Theres a lot of weird esoteric mechanics in this game that arent documented well or made available to the casual player.

10457256,0,t1_dcsp1dd,Dont rush in alone. Melee GI is actually more a support class who Cloaks into a dying cluster of enemies to seizureflashgethshieldenergize them to melting goo. Have a helpful Geth Engineer on the team heh. I swear half of the stupid Geronimo stuff I did in that match only worked because this guy was a fucking masterful teammate spamming the shield bot on top of me and zapping Overloads everywhere. Dont try to melee armor. Just dont. I melted a Dragoon successfully but then I tried to take on a Brute... I had to use medigel. And most of all dont try to melee Ravagers. Im of the firm opinion that Ravagers are the most terrifying enemy for a melee GI. If youre good with timing the melees into a chain you can take down Phantoms though itll be nerve wracking every time. Provided you stack every melee bonus you have available all melee fitness  gear  consummables mooks will melt relatively easily though I cant say anything about Collectors because I refuse to approach Collectors unless Im packing something like the Piranha or the missile or Im about to assplode their asses with a combo. Melee GI is incredibly destructive. The melee DPS has got to be one of the highest in the game if not the highest I honestly never saw Juggs Krolords or anything dispense melee death so fast but this build is the ultimate glass canon. You need to have a fallback plan before each assault because if a surprise CerbTrooper sticks you while youre retreating after melting his brethren you will go down. You have practically no health and if youre doing your job right you shouldnt have shields for most of the time youre engaging the enemy. Youre a One Hit Point Wonder but with nuke power. But I have to say there are few things more satisfying than rushing into a spawn of mooks and a Phantom mixed in and unloading until they evaporate and retreating and be like I dont give a fuck.

11253591,0,t3_60m7i4,I enjoy the moment to moment gameplay a good bit more.If you lived and breathed melee builds its probably a bit worse. If you lived and breathed gun heavy builds Id say its a bit better. If you like high mobility its certainly a LOT better. The maps are also a strong point IMO as they are a good bit bigger especially when you factor in the verticality. There is a stronger focus on powers being mostly about debuffs and combos rather than straight damage or buffs. There is a stronger focus on making sure everyone is using their guns often. There is a stronger focus on forcing mobility and making it hard to turtle. There is a MUCH stronger focus on weak points some enemies being almost unkillable without proper weak point targeting. Overall there are a lot of  and   but Id say its improved more fun and will only get even more funbetter with time. I wont be going back.That being said there are obviously DRASTICALLY less options atm. This will improve over time as they release more characters enemies weapons maps etc. But right now there are  unique kits  maps  enemy types and  weapons I think?.

11342006,0,t1_dfgu4ed,The problem is there are people who will go and buy premium boxes until their ultrarare class of choice hits X.  They make a ton of money from these people.  People are also buying heavily into the boxes.  In a way this is fine.  What is more problematic imo is that the rotating shop is a joke or that we cant buy class levels with credits for example leveling up a kineticist could cost k or even k and then it would be more reasonable because you could choose and focus on what you want rather than being COMPLETELY subjective to RNG.  This wouldnt discourage the people spamming crates either because they dont want to farm the credits in the first place.  Or you know things could show up in the rotating shop Im sure most people woulud be fine dumping  mission funds to  their ultrarare of choice etc except that the rotating shop is a sham that just gives out free gear every  weeks instead of giving us a tool to combat RNG.,MECoOp,dfhlhn7,3,t5_2tkk1

11344469,0,t3_61w438,Ive been using it as a shotgun on my Krogan Engineer at short range and occasionally using it scoped at long range as a secondary weapon to my Charger since it keeps me at  recharge and I dont have anything better to use at the moment. Edit So I decided to gamble on a k pack to break from the monotony of k packs in the hope of scoring a better weapon... and it paid off I pulled a Vanquisher. Having tried both guns I see what the big deal is about now and they really need to tune up the Viper somehow. Im able to compare the Viper IV with my Vanquisher I now and the most shocking difference is damage my Vanquisher I does  damage per shot compared to Viper IVs  so you have to land  shots on the Viper to do what one shot from Vanquisher does... however with one less round in the magazine on Viper despite doing half the damage and having identical fire rates means a full clip from the Viper isnt capable of doing half the damage of a full clip from the Vanquisher because of having to reload the Viper before you can get enough bullets out. So Id guess that a Vanquisher  beats even a Viper X by an outlandish margin.But until you get it  might as well use Viper on BronzeSilver and get practice with how it handles in this game because then when you get Vanquisher youll be getting kills like never before. It moved me up the scoreboard at the end of the match. ,MECoOp,dfhvj6t,4,t5_2tkk1

11349937,0,t3_61vlav,Great post.  The two biggest threats to the games longevity is the low difficulty and the uselessness of  of the weapons.  Honestly if you use anything other than a sniper or maybe a hurricanecharger you are already handicapped during the run.  Unless youre a melee of course. But making the rifles shotguns and pistols practically useless because they have no damage output effectively makes the snipes overpowered.  In a game where you are essentially running the same content over and over and over again not having weapon variety is crippling.  Also in all honesty my group can run any map with any enemy type on gold all day and have absolutly zero issues.  Zero.  Gold at this state isnt even a challenge.If these two changes were made the game would be a lot more balanced and fun.  Balance changes to melee builds and cloak builds should also be implemented but the more glaring issues lie in the two aspects mentioned above,MECoOp,dfihta2,1,t5_2tkk1

11353052,0,t1_dfiu0q2,gt If you werent playing a solo style class NShadow for example you should have been holding the line with your group. That was the most successful way to play and you were hurting your teams chances by running around.Ive played a lot of ME too. I dont have all URs at level X but I have all the guns. I dont have any platinum solos in fact because I only played the game with friends.The best games we ever played as a group where when we played complimentary classes. Like the biotic death squad. Or when a friend was the Paladin and I was the iceslinger human soldier. Those kinds of combos made platinum easy. But the number one rule of platinum which you should certainly know as a solo player is that you judge when you are being overwhelmed. When that is the case you retreat in a cycle around the map. That way enemies usually behind your movement and you can take advantage of the RH rule.Now I agree that the game could be too easy as it is with better biotics. But the problem is right now its unsatisfying because combos are relatively worthless. Like you can melee about as much damage as combos. The real issue is that they seem to have gimped everything or increased enemy health because the game was too easy during testing. This has made some abilities completely worthless. They need to find ways to make the game more difficult but still have biotic explosions and assault riflesshotguns be more effective. This would be the ideal solution because players would feel satisfied with combos and certain weapons but still have a challenge.,MECoOp,dfiuinc,24,t5_2tkk1

11383878,0,t1_dfmbprv,I have almost all nonURs around rank . They do get better but I could see ME vets still being underwhelmed and feeling upset. Tailoring certain builds certain ways can make up for that and allow you to destroy gold on basically every class although I have felt using a very optimized build to be valuable maybe a bit of a letdown. Maybe. At guns X I really can see the game being what people expected the release to be like and followed up with tweaks. The issue is when the game is released no one has rank X guns and everyone has to go through the grind entirely upset with the current state. It does get better though maybe not to the extent players are hoping. I dont think much balance needs are in order except on specific guns. Many would disagree but many who have high level guns also probably agree with me. Our nostalgia is attached to level  characters and guns ranked X from ME. Not Rank I guns on level  characters. It does get better.,MECoOp,dfmcd9b,2,t5_2tkk1

11387365,0,t1_dfm64uy,Agreed the insurgent is a god might low key be the best class in the game in my opinon. I usually score k points with him on gold. With bio ward and the right upgrades for shield boost you are incredibly hard to kill. Take the rank  duration on shield boost  the power duration on rank  fitness and you get something like  seconds uptime on shield boost and then it only has a  second recharge with recharge perks. So youll have like  uptime on shield boost.Tripmines are super strong and you can wipe spawns of enemies with them the stun also allows you to line up free headshots on enemies like berserkers.And I dont think most people know how good bioelectri ward is. I have the operator as well but he is really squishy compared to the insurgent since the insurgent basically gets  damage reduction for  seconds every  seconds while the salarian doesnt. The operator is ok but why would I bother infecting enemies when I can just delete them with tripmines?Hes so good on objectives too since he can just prevent enemies from swarming in by staggering tripmines.Tldr I love the insurgent PI personally dont spec into turret though allthough I like the concept of debuffing armor with cryo ammo. I usually max out the passives and do  point in turret. But I imagine maxing turret and going for lower cooldowns and stuff could be pretty good for maximum shield boost spam.,MECoOp,dfmqlp1,1,t5_2tkk1
11387610,0,t3_62fcln,I understand that things can get a little stale with Mass Effect MP sometimes because mostly in PUG youd want to minimise the risk of failure and therefore usually run whatever is safest   currently  GoldOutlawSandstorm not too different to what happened with Firebase WhiteGeth or towards the end of the Meta with GlacierReapers. Im glad theyre taking their time for the Meta to find its stable point before making any changes as thats the smarter option. The Casual player base will likely not have advanced far into developing a variety of characters and weapons. Giving a broader player base will help with the devs understand what are the key areas to tweak maybe combo strength power strength etc. Better to let it settle first then change it up as needed. There were a lot of nerfs and then hasty rebuffs that happened in the previous Gen. I think they want to avoid that kind of disruption. Right now its not too bad. Theyre likely also still getting a lot of new players who are just buying the game or finishing the campaign. Biweekly updates sounds like a happy frequency to run with. I sympathise that it might be annoying that they originally said Weekly I wish they would have told us earlier.

But I dont think we should take for granted the  armor debuff it provides for the whole team. Although the cooldown on the turret is a bitch youll get more used to it knowing when to self destroy and replace it. Id argue its less situational to use than the trip mines because Im building him like a team player less on solo Ramboing killing stuff on my own. Though I did take the  weight capacity on him because the other one is Imo more situational again with future patches we might be able to deal some damage with detonations? Hopeful me?

That challenge is kind of hilarious. I wonder how they came up with the requirements for it.How about we create a list of challenges for the players to complete you know with stuff like Complete the tutorial Earn some medals Finish a strike team mission Reach level  Own a rank  gun and Extract on Gold difficulty?Brilliant just add Get the experience equivalent of like  levels but only by playing a very limited amount of characters to the list!That sounds extremely reasonable and equivalent to the other requirements! Brilliant!OT Unfortunately I dont have a bonus stat higher than level  at the moment but still believe I can add to the conversation.In my opinion the best case scenario we can hope for as I doubt subsequent levels would ever require less experience is the scaling of        x gt x gt x gt x gt x gt x     gt Bonus stat  is the equivalent of getting  characters to level While the worst case scenario scaling as you pointed out is    x gt x gt x gt x gt x gt x    gt Bonus stat  is the equivalent of getting  characters to level ,MECoOp,dfrpyam,5,t5_2tkk1

11483932,0,t1_dfxniz6,Its unpopular because its wrong.  The silver assault rifles in ME were Mattock Vindicator and Phaeston.  Mattock was marginally better than the other two but that was just because its strengths accuracy range damage per shot were more appealing to a larger number of classes under a wider range of circumstances.Neither of the other two assault rifles were so weak that the Mattock was an obvious choice for all classes under all circumstances...the Phaeston was great for soldier classes was much better at providing suppressing fire than the Mattock and was better at shortmedium ranges when it was more important that you put a lot of ammo downrange rather than a few accurate highly damaging shots.  And if you had a class with any kind of stability buffs or recoil mitigation the Vindicator was a goddamn instant death headshot laser.I loved the mattock but only because it was more satisfying than its contemporaries...I liked its range and the sharp crack it made when it was fired and the fact that it paired well with hybrid combatpowers classes to soften an enemy before a combo or finish an enemy off.  But to say it was too good is some highly revisionist history.  It was better than the Locust the Tempest and the Incisor.  It was just as good as the Phalanx the Eviscerator the Raptor and the Viper.  It was conditionally slightly better or worse than the Scimitar Vindicator and Phaeston depending on which class you were playing.,MECoOp,dfxp9yl,5,t5_2tkk1

11487864,0,t1_dfy2ca2,In ME you could easily one shot even shielded mooks on gold yet the game wasnt really easy. The kill time in ME on any difficulty even on platinum was much lower for the cannon fodder. Only the boss units had alot more health than in Andromeda. The difficulty in ME came from the fact that enemies could actually pressure you because you couldnt jetpack away from any situation and you could die in seconds if not properly positioned.Now in andromeda you have the ability to escape everything and enemies cant really pressure you if you are mobile. Getting stuck in a room is pretty much impossible. So what did they do? They increased the time to kill on the low tier enemies to make them more of an obstacle. They did that by severely nerfing all powers weapons and classes. Thats obviously making the game very boring. Its better to make everything OP and then balance the way enemies interact with the player  new enemy types more enemies per wave giving the enemies more damage or new tools to pressure the player and so on. But bullet sponges and shitty weapons ie shotguns that cant even headshot with all the pellets at point blank range is not making the game fun.But yeah its def not as easy as reducing enemy health and  giving them more numbers.,MECoOp,dfy5cbd,8,t5_2tkk1

11576765,0,t3_657qs1,Melee can work but its no vanGOD. The thing to remember is with CQC is you get ramping melee damage so jumping into a group with a ground slam gets it going much quicker. Plus she gets a greater AOE range with her ground slam to greater facilitate this action. If you have your heart set on melee with her skip the Turbocharge so you have two crowd control skills. While not being able to do fire detonations incinerate and flak cannon are great for crowd control. They each give you a good two free swings on most people. On gold this will kill mooks and will only need a few more for captains. The Havocs main weakness is not having a reliable way to get shieldshealth back like a vanguard but your healthshield pool is much higher so you can rumble for a bit then will have to play it safe while your shields recover. With melee synergy in the munitions training tree you get a  melee increase after firing and with debuff from sustained fire when using a shotgun each pellet should be a separate  debuff so the  cap is hit quick you hit very hard. An engagement should be to float over a group a first ground slam into them this is buggy off host but better after last patch b flak cannon the ground at your feet to stun c fire a shotgun blast at nearest mook d melee a few times then shotgun blast then melee etc. until e there is an armored unit or you start getting shot. Then send out an incinerate to stun them while you meleeshotgun them or need to get away. Dont underestimate the slow burn approach for bigger things. Incinerate then go melee someone else then hit them again with incinerate. Max out the passives and incinerate first then you will start feeling Havocesque. Also situational awareness is needed more so because she doesnt have saving barrier or charge or shield drain or cloak or any of the other get out of jail free cards that crutch for some squishier classes.

11582410,1,t1_dg8uekm,I just got done commenting about the devs being vague actually lol. Basically everyone wants big huge buffs to everything right now so more guns feel viable and powers and comboes feel stronger and more impactful. But like you said simply amping everything up is like taking a wrecking ball to every other element that went into how the matches were designed. Bronze and silver would become a pointless joke so everything that went into balancing those difficulty levels also become irrelevant. The specific immediate changes being clamored for just arent feasible without creating more issues and more work and more backlash for shit constantly jumping all over the place and being a jumbled mess.  Whats the point of being transparent when you know the vast majority of feedback is just gonna be getting shit flung at you for taking small steps and getting called retards because you cant prevent unforseen bugs or unintended results as a consequence of changing one single thing. Ive also seen people saying they should come out and say they screwed up various things for various reasons but in this enviroment thats just another reason to get berated. Instead of theories you now have to place blame on an entire company or single out individuals at fault to the public.

Heres what I have to addYes finishing matches and speedrunning times are much lower because matches are now  waves  waves shorter so thats not really fair to compare. If your point is that getting credits is faster than sure BUT to compensate they have heavily diluted the drop table by giving both characters and weapon mods  ranks instead of  increasing the amount of avaiable boosters and lowering the drop rate per card ME  uncommon drops per advanced pack MEA  uncommon drop per advanced pack very rarely As for your final argument I agree. Too low TTK make the game too easy and no fun. Boring. But too high TTK do the opposite make you feel like youre shooting rubber bullets and I think thats the major problem This is a shooter and you want to feel like youre shooting actual bullets. I think the purpose of basic mooks in ME WAS to feel powerful. When throwing them around extinguishing a whole group with a powerful tech combo that sort of thing. Thats why they stopped showing up on later waves.

11615718,0,t3_65rgy7,By rarityCommon Engineer  has good CC and debuffs.  Human Soldier  really good weapon platform can also be a good combo class since Concussive Shot can be made to have  CD. Infiltrator  AntiArmor Sticky Bombs can take out bosses quick. Sniper or ShottyPistol are both solid options. Cloak lets you get out of tight situations and solo objectives.Uncommon I honestly like every uncommon class including Krogan  Engineer. Asari Adept  by far favorite class. Can go melee or power build and be equally effective. Also has some good team support with damage taken debuff and shield restores. Kroguard  I like it but it is to much like VanGOD to really suggest it.  Turian Soldier  the best Weapon Platform in the game. Turbocharge  his passives let him make almost any gun viable. Can get a little dull as you dont do much beyond shootturboshoot.Rare  Angara Insurgent  I second this one Krogan Merc  Again I second this one. UltraRare Pretty much every single one is fun to play.

11664597,0,t1_dghng0p,Nope Asari Duelist and Asari Adept are correct in their respective spots if change would be made which will be when the next patch drops would be  bump up for Adept. The havoc trooper is a good class but to fully utilize it you need a higher skill set then any of the engineers because engineers point spray ice walk away leaving the armored victim with no  armor debuff while havoc trooper you have to float around which can be inconvenient at times and really put you out of position. Salarian Operator tier  with current feedback I can see a lower tier A for him but I still feel hes much better with a coordinated team. This tier list is meant for what character can I use with the least amount of effort to win. p.s. Asari Duelist having a  at max melee buff and the fact of invincibility frames puts her there which is the second highest melee buff ingame currently only offset by Krogan Gladiator with if I understand properly how the pull  melee works .,MECoOp,dgi73s2,1,t5_2tkk1

11671308,0,t1_dgix93o,Keep in mind they probably have to allocate resources to both single players and multiplayer updates at the same time Im sure theyve not dedicated their entire team to fixing multiplayer.Lets be real they released the game before it was ready on both SP and MP and are now scrambling to apply the most effective updates possible to address both. SP has a lot more exposure MP is the minority. Both need work.Id personally rather they focused on a bigger multiplayer update that makes notable improvements rather than rushing out something that is just going to further piss people off because it a doesnt do everything they want it to or b actually makes things work.Personally I see the balance issues I realize how such a small minority of things are viable at the top end and how much potential is currently lost due to simply number changes but... Im not so impatient that I cant take it easy for another month or two while they sort things out.

11673538,0,t3_66jczc,Honestly Im still concerned about how much weight they give to internal testing when it comes to balance numbers. Clearly their internal processes did not produce acceptable balance the first time around. But if the changes they plan to make are not strictly numerical such as adding the concept of leveled combo damage then a delay may be justifiable as code changes inherently require more testing.Either way releasing one large monolithic patch isnt going to be very scientific. Smaller weekly balance passes would give a clearer indication of real world effects of individual changes.

11679726,0,t1_dgjwhdk,Thats the catch really. The worse your team is the higher your own personal score. And then there are moments that prove that score isnt everything. Like the mission earlier where my Punch Adept beat out two Vanguards for score. And its not like they were bad either. We tore that gold mission a new one. Theyd Charge to things and punch the shit out of them Id Pull things and punch the shit out of them. It was a hell of a fun time but I came out ahead because of double dipping. Pull gives you assist points even if nobody else touches the enemy. Combine assist medals with melee kill medals and regular kill medals... Not to mention the biotic kill medals when Id fling a Singularity and Shockwave on something shielded or armored while punching it...The poor infiltrator got fucked though. I know he had to be getting pissed off to watch his targets get punched to death while trying to line up his shots. At least we had someone to deal with the Destroyers.,MECoOp,dgjwweq,3,t5_2tkk1
11679811,0,t3_66j6id,Combat fitness is the best part of the Human Infiltrator. He becomes a real tank  tankier than sentinels while still keeping tac cloak and higher damage passives than many other characters. I just dont put anything in stickies. Incinerate is nice damage combo primer and detonator  great CC for those targets that just refuse to sit still. Combat fitness makes you very tanky specced for DR regen delay in cover and DR when under  health. And I spec cloak for cooldown duration and  sec damage. I go cooldown instead of the  damage because it drops the cd to  sec which helps with overall dps and also lets me use cloak to save my ass or revive teammates more often.,MECoOp,dgjx8wo,1,t5_2tkk1
11680570,0,t1_dgj0x8c,For me the Krogan Vanguard is always  with weapon focus because of the reasons outlined in my original post that started this thread but you can build him two ways damage resistance  weapon damage  power damage  melee damage . Nova is poor unless you spec for power damage and force in the Apex Training tree  so if you want to use it then replace Fortify with it take power damage boost and shock trooper instead of radius weapon boost and bastion and go for Melee damage in the rage tree but Human Vanguard can do Nova and melee so well already that theres nothing particularly unique to the Krogan about this playstyle for me.For the weapon build I propose take A A A in Rage to give him maximum health and shields and minimum health regeneration delay  youre going to be exposing yourself to a lot of enemy fire in this build. When speccing Fortify you can pretty much take any combination but I would say there are two main variants mobility B A B or tanking weapons platform A B A. With so much damage resistance I personally just charge in stand still to gain  damage resistance per second for up to  seconds which perfectly matches Bastions  seconds of  damage resistance for  secs  which is not a coincidence! and unload a full magazine of shotgun ammo into their face. Use Ruzad for the stun effect so you dont get stun locked yourself by enemy melee attacks.,MECoOp,dgk0cdr,1,t5_2tkk1

11751053,0,t1_dgqpful,Honestly the answer to this should have been plain and obvious from the situation The state the Milkyway expedition is in should have been dire like almost Battlestar Gallactica levels of bleak. No reinforcements no support and an extremely finite number of each individual species around. Krogan Females should be fighting because they simply dont have the supplies or the numbers to keep them out of the action.Unfortunately the games actual story doesnt really bare this out. Everyone is far far to cheerful and while the situation is presented as dire  you never really get that feeling. Doesnt help that the game play fails to reinforce the idea of strained resources with few Milkyway species around given you shoot endless numbers of nameless outlaws from all the races.,MECoOp,dgs0f3h,2,t5_2tkk1

But I think what you meant and the answer youre not getting is which kits are generally accepted as being better than the others or in the upper tier of usefulness.Heres my opinionHuman Vanguard Human Sentinel Human Kineticist Asari Adept Asari Duelist Krogan Vanguard Krogan Gladiator Salarian Operator Angaran Insurgent Angaran Avenger Turian Soldier and any infiltrator are the upper half of the kits.  All of them are awesome in their own way.The others are definitely usable but feel less effective to me.  Also I really dislike playing any of the engineers.,MECoOp,dgs7r2o,2,t5_2tkk1

11756977,0,t1_dgsmejy,If the next patch doesnt address stability power combos and weapon accuracy in a serious way Im through with Andromeda for a while.  Mass Effect has one thing going for it and thats the power fantasy the absolute crushing intensity of decimating enemies with powers and weapons.

11763918,0,t3_67uufa,Play bronze for few hours learn mechanics enemies maps.Stay in cover for the most part unless you know exactly how to fight outofthecover its classbased thing not every class is suitable.First off get some consumables and get used to them. Unlike SP cobraFrevive packFammo packFshieldhealth packF are always equipped. When you are low on hp you can use health pack when you are dead you can revive youself. Each consumable has its count of uses per round and should be bought from store for gold no need to waste andromeda points to enjoy the game and even if you want to spend some dont waste it to supplies. Most effective at start is supply crate k gold each buy them after first bronze game.Number of consumable usages increases with unlock cards you can find in basic crates k each. Dont hesitate to buy them until you get unlocks of X rank.One of most annoying things at least on PC is voice chat  activated but not properly set up. When this happens your machine sends game sound echo to everyone. Make sure you set up voice chat in Origin  either disable it or set pushtotalk button select appropriate microphone etc.The other side of voice chat  what you hear from others. You can always disable hearing of individual player in lobbygame. In lobby select player by left click and press X.

11768489,0,t1_dgtuooa,I could see it mattering a bit for the Indra Incisor Raptor Shadow sort.  Their damage per shot isnt so high so armor damage reduction matters on them and they need multiple shots to kill things.Its not immediately obvious that something like the Isharay or Widow will actually benefit significantly damage far exceeding the flat reduction from armor may not affect shots to kill one would need data on enemy health plus the modifiers from the kit in use plus headshot multipliers to know whether it would actually save any shots in common situations.,MECoOp,dgtzm4o,1,t5_2tkk1

11783081,0,t1_dgvn6qp,gt Lots of games come out needing day one patches.With respect I dont understand how this justifies the practice of releasing a broken game. If I delivered a project to one of my clients in the state that many AAA games come out these days I would be out of business. gtBreath of the Wild got one as did Horizon Zero dawn and ME got a couple as well.The issue absolutely not about day  patches... that makes complete sense given the supply chain and wanting to make final tweaks while the game is physically being created. The issue is the state of the game before the patch... Horizon was absolutely playable the minute it came out but the patch made it better. I didnt play BOTW so I cant comment there but MEA had many many game breaking bugs in SP and many balance issues in MP. The patch . made many of these existing issues worse. ,MECoOp,dgvnfc4,1,t5_2tkk1
