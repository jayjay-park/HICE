4622031,0,t1_ctd6f3e,I honestly picked her cause the tele looked interesting. Ive been using her for mixups like you would see in mvc or street fighter with my longest combos going no more than  or so. Its probably not how you would use her but I at least have blocking down for the characters Ive played against since blocking in mvc was much faster I can at least fend off a bit although is there a pushblock? Also Im still not sure when I can capitalize. Bullet for instance seems to go on and on and shes gets into beast mode speed similar to dark Phoenix mvc with her down spike looking thing to continue comboing grabs. Furthermore I may be doing it wrong but I cant seem to grab off startup coming off the ground and its a habit I have. ahard time breaking and I end up getting punished for it.,Blazblue,ctd6kc6,1,t5_2s6iq

4717489,0,t3_3fja4o,I use Japanese audio but you already knew that. I have too many complaints about the English audio for me to use it myself. But some of it I like. Ragnas English voice Patrick Seitz does really good work. Noel Cristina Vee is good too I just hate her characters because theyre all so strong and oppressive when ahead. Tager is also done well you can count on his voice actor to do solid work.But some of the girls voices I cant stand to me they sound like YouTube fandubs by amateurs like they could probably do better with time but right now theyre kind of meh. Also for some reason Terumi is British which doesnt make any sense at all because in the original Japanese Terumi is supposed to sound more vulgar and unrefined.Another thing is that Ive been following the Japanese voice actors seiyuu for years and I really enjoy their work. Seiyuu are generally of a much higher caliber than their English counterparts because so much more is required of them. Their voices are usually better trained because they often sing since many of them do the openings or endings for the anime theyre in or they also have careers as Jpop artists.Dont get me wrong though some English voice acting I really enjoy and respect. Its pretty much all dudes though. Patrick Seitz Travis Willingham Crispin Freeman Liam OBrien havent heard him recently but who could forget Vic Mig... Migno... Minnesotas Edward Elric?.

Learn how to teleport.Learn your jump cancelable moves.Learn how to properly use your nails.And most importantly learn how to fight with out the nails.D is your biggest asset in this. Since its guard point starts at frame  you can use it as a reaction teleport. Its especially useful when you realize that Bang doesnt have a DP. This and his daifunka running super are the ones you really want to use a reversal.The problem with using his super as a reversal is that if they know about it and block it youre going to eat it.. hard. Unless you rapid cancel.  God I miss the old umbrella super...Also learn your jump cancelable moves on block. It will help your mix up game and becomes INVALUABLE when working with bumpers.As for movement and getting that first hit.. I would say play Bang as a bird of prey. Since he has the nd most air options aside from Tao he naturally covers a lot of ground with his air dashes.

9744963,0,t1_dae73ht,Show me one other character in the history of Blazblue that has hitboxes as large as hers that comes out as fast as hers and deal as much damage as hers. Show me another character with those attributes that has a projectile that hits twice and can break guards when charged that doesnt require heat. Show me another character that can rack up .k just by getting a lucky C mash in. Her massive hitboxes shit all over Valks wolf. If Izanami wants to get in close enough for her mixup to actually matter she needs to do that crazy full screen sweep the input of which I cant recall right now and that gets called out by a variety of Mais tools. Other high tiers I can see having the utility to open her up more reliably but does any close range character have even the slightest chance of getting in on a Mai who uses her options appropriately? As far as her mixup is goes that just requires a little bit of creativity as far as Im concerned. I mean ffs they figured out an instant overhead with Terumi in CP that never failed to catch my opponents off guard. The only thing I can say that isnt good or at least decent with Mai is that she has no meterless reversal. I might just be hating but it just seems to me like every other character you listed at the very least requires far more effort than Mai. Shes so brain dead its mindnumbing. Even Jin and Tsubaki generally easy characters still require a modicum of time and effort to get good with. Mai is just high tier because she exists. ,Blazblue,daea1tg,-1,t5_2s6iq
