1447157,0,t3_2apvq1,gtA theological hypothetical for all those armchair ecclesiologists in the audience what if literally every Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox bishop suddenly died before they were able to ordain any new bishops? How would apostolic succession be preserved or retconned? Would Anglican orders suddenly turn out to be good enough? Would priests be upgraded to bishops? Is there already a contingency plan hidden in the depths of the Vatican?Christianity would look like rabbinic Judaism in that Sacrifice wouldnt be offered until the Messiah comes and gets things restarted. In the meantime wed have the Liturgy of the Hours to bring heaven and earth together. Also see the Pope Michael documentary. ,christianwhatif,cixoe5d,2,t5_328f5
