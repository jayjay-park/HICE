4720,0,t1_ceexiuq,If the post hadnt specifically said cheap and was just a rave about a face mask this wouldnt be an issue. Whether you consider  dollars a little or a lot to spend on something is subjective but in the context of skincare where there is a wide range of effective products under the  dollar mark a  dollar product is pretty objectively out of the cheap range even if you can easily afford it. A lot of people would click this link with the expectation of finding a product in the lowend price range and would end up finding this unhelpful.,SkincareAddiction,ceez3f8,3,t5_2tbbg

7550,0,t3_1u79mt,I used ProActiv when I was  or  and... well it made everything go from bad to worse. I used the kit till it was gone because it was so expensive. I developed giant cystic type zits around my lips chin nose and on my forehead that I havent had to that extent before or since. It was especially bad on my chin. I normally get acne around my chin but the acne I got while using ProActiv was insane. It also made my skin so flakey that I couldnt use make up to cover up the break outs!I had hyperpigmentation from the acne it gave me that stayed on my face for a good  months before finally fading away. I thought the spots were going to be permanent and that freaked me out pretty bad.I think the kit I had came with a bonus sulphur maskspot treatment and that was about the only thing that seemed to make my acne better not worse.Ive used other systems from Neutrogena and CleanampClear and those seemed to help more than harm.

133664,0,t3_1vly7y,I had extremely oily and sensitive skin as well and had the same results with the Cerave in the tub. It was making my skin more oily and was clogging my pores. I have tried so many different products for oily skin and everything I tried was making my skin tight and even more oily. I finally found something that has completely changed my skin! I was reading a lot about how oily skin can actually be caused by dehydrated skin. I decided to try using oils for my moisturizers and I will never go back. I tried jojoba but it clogged my pores and broke me out as I have really sensitive skin. But my skin has been loving Argan oil. My morning moisturizer is just  organic  cold pressed argan oil and at night I use Keihls midnight recovery concentrate which is absolutely amazing and super gentle light and smells incredible. I noticed a difference after just one day. I have been using them both for over  months and to my surprise I am acne free as well....which is crazy because I had given up on trying to fix my cystic acne. The recovery concentrate has also been really helping with fading my hyperpigmentation. My skin isnt oily at all anymore just dewy. And so so so soft! I cannot recommend these products enough. Also I always had an issue with sunscreen making me oily. I found the Devita solar protective moisturizer SPF  and I will use this for as long as they make it! It soaks in right away not oily at all and it is the only one that doesnt leave my skin red and broken out. I hope some of this helped. I would really recommend trying oils. Your skin may be dehydrated like mine was. Not every oil is for everyone but I would at least try Argan. It isnt too rich and is really gentle. I also tried the OCM method but my skin is just too sensitive and it seems to clog my pores no matter what oil I use. But as a moisturizer it is absolutely amazing. All you need is  drops and just press it into your skin. TLDR  I had the same problem. Try oils. You may have dehydrated skin. I reccomend Argan for in the morning and Keihls Midnight recovery concentrate for night time. ,SkincareAddiction,cetnjxp,2,t5_2tbbg

Youve got refined or unrefined organic vs not organic you have wild crafted sustainable and rare oils. You have expeller pressed and cold pressed. You have companies who say one thing and do another such as claiming to be a particular oil while adulterating them to go further in their stock. So keep in mind when you are leaning about carrier oils the variables are staggering. Happy shopping to everyone! Markey  garden of wisdom  Oh and Hi!! Also beechain with the lb vs gallon do you feel that selling a gallon of oil should be done by weight so the customer receives  oz which is one gallon?

178022,0,t3_1w410x,I was on accutane twice and both times made me lose hair. I had to stop my first treatment about a month early BC of it...I had really thick hair and it got super thin. Gobs of hair fell out. I tried another time on a smaller dose with the same result and ended it early again. My hair took a while to grow back and it was never the same. I had fine hair but a lot of it before. After it was still fine but a normal amount of it. My brother also lost his hair on accutane. Would I do it again? Yes. Not at my age now but if I had to do it all over I would. My skin wasnt cured from it but idk how much more of a pain it would be if I was never on it. It vastly improved my skin otherwise. I was  when I was on it and Im  now. Im still on minocycline birth control and I use differin regarding Rx I use for my skin. What sucks is that if you do lose hair it takes a while for it to happen and about a month to get out of your system. Unfortunately you cant easily try it then stop!

186455,0,t1_cezn9jw,I havent tried looking for a clinic but I will! Ok this is how this all started. One summer day I was helping my fiancs mom move. I started sweating a lot and suddenly my jawneck got incredibly itchy. When I got home I saw that I had all these tiny little bumps all over my jaw and neck. They looked like white heads and when you popped them they were full of puss. It itched SO bad. After about a week it all went away and my skin was fine for a couple months. Then the same thing happened again only I had no idea why! Possibly I sweat a lot again not sure couldnt pin point it. Again it cleared up and for a month my skin was fine. I attributed it to some face wipes I was using because when I used them it felt really tingly and itchy. Like maybe using it and then sweating caused a bad reaction. So I stopped using them. Then I started having these issues. And they just never went away. I tried switching foundation powder moisturizer cleanser soap shampoo... Change pillow cases frequently wear my hair up mostly... Dry my hair before I put makeup on so it doesnt melt into my skin. I bought a clarisonic I bought some Aztec clay mask that had face reviews... Stopped using a wash cloth on my face... Nothing has helped. Really the only thing that feels like it has helped is the anti bacterial soap. But I will stop using it and Im going to try the OCM method Cerave cleanser and Cerave moisturizer and see what happens. Maybe there is a common ingredient somewhere that I am allergic to I cant figure it out though  ,SkincareAddiction,cezoc2g,1,t5_2tbbg

They dont cause me any irritation and theyre great for when Im feeling too lazy to go through my whole regimen but dont want to sleep with makeup! That said Ive recently started using a different line of products that actually sounds like it would accomplish what youre looking for the Alpha Hydrox glycolic acid line  I started using this line for my acne after a friend recommended itits convenient as I move toward my midtwenties to find treatments for both wrinkles and acneand that plus my Herculean efforts not to pick at my face have given me skin that Im not embarrassed of which is a huge deal. They have creams and cleansers that you can buy with  glycolic acid content  for their foot cream which is high enough that it stings on open skin but low enough not to irritate anything else and it DEFINITELY makes your skin smoother. Im using the AHA enhanced cream rather than the lotion because their website says its better for acneprone skin but what I really want to try is their highestrated product the souffl. I may also try their toner because the Bliss one I have a Sephora product I also got at Marshalls makes my skin sticky and shiny. Anyway Im really excited about the benefits of this stuff and I hope you find something that works for you. p.s. their products are available on Amazon but theyre cheaper on the site I linked and you get free shipping with orders of not an Alpha Hydrox sales rep,SkincareAddiction,cf5su8g,1,t5_2tbbg
241687,0,t3_1wvjn7,Is it itchy or uncomfortable? I get irritation and rashes that look similar. The bumps werent pimples. So I would not use BP cream or exfoliate too often. Im not familiar with the Neostrata AHA is it a cream? I dont know if its effective exfoliation but I would use it a couple times a week at most. I would also get a heavier moisturizer like this Eucerin Skin Calming one or try Nivea Cream in the small blue tin if youre not sensitive to fragrance. The Neutrogena moisturizer appears to be oilfree which isnt really a plus. Oil particularly mineral oil is necessary for your skin especially asian skin IMO. Cortisone will help with any itching. Sweat and hot showers may irritate it so try to rinse immediately after sweating and use lukewarm water. Also dont scrub with a loofah or rubscratch at it. Wash your shirts frequently. Hopefully it will disappear soon. I would not see a doctor unless it was seriously impacting your life negatively.

Then I started looking at Asian skincare routines which use anywhere from  products and it really helped with my skin. Their toner is not astringent but is designed to add moisture back into the skin which has been stripped in the cleansing process. The routine also includes an emulsifying lotion step and serum step before the moisturizer. Also stay away from foaming cleanser. It dehydrates you like crazy stick to cleansing milk or balm. Lastly try putting something like Aquafor all over your face after moisturizer at night before you go to bed. This helps seal in all the moisture while you sleep. Some of my favorite Asian skincare lines are Benton and Mizon. Also a really cool cheap trick is to mix Glycerol can buy at any pharmacy with water and spritz that on the face. I buy water bottles with a spray top fill it with water add a teaspoon of glycerol and spritz my face with this after cleansing before toner when my skin is really really dry.

They found that the patients with AV exhibited markedly higher sebum secretion and greater TEWL and markedly decreased SC conductance corneometry testing. The combined findings of higher TEWL and lower SC hydration decreased conductance noted in the patients with AV compared to controls supports SC permeability barrier impairment associated with AV.Woo lot of specialized lingo there. What do they mean by decreased conductance? The SC stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis which is the outer layer of the skin what does it mean exactly for the SC to have decreased conductance?

For example oils break down latex gloves and cause them to break.  There could be a similar reaction happening between the chemicals in your lotion and the chemicals in your gloves.

Some of the reason for the major difference in comedogenicity is that the industry standard for comedogenicity testing has been the inside of rabbit ears  however this is an imperfect model because rabbits do not exhibit an inflammatory acne response like humans do only inflammatory and their pore sizes are different. Weve actually known this for a long time This is exactly why mineral oil was thought for the longest time to be comedogenic when in reality it isnt mineral oil causes comedones in rabbit ears but not on people.BTW the reason why rabbit ears are used is because its way more reproducible and less expensive to do testingclinical trials than with people.Some of the numbers may be derived from the rabbit ear model others from human clinical trials...and theres even variability within those two models for actual experimental design the standardized  scale may actually be adapted from a myriad number of scales from individual experiments and even then the ratings are somewhat subjective.

616805,0,t3_215ts2,When using a retinol and doing peels you really need to be off it for  days prior to performing your peel. This is especially important if you have just introduced the retinol within the past month or so. Retinol is speeding up your cell turnover rate much like your peel making you more sensitive to any type of chemical exfoliation.As far as frosting goes it is very normal to see brown spots where you frosted. This isnt always as common with salicylic peels depending on the   as say a jessners or tca but it can happen if your skin is a bit more compromised. These will most likely be the areas where you flake. For the next few weeks be extra gentle with your skin. No peels and dont use any ahas or bhas until the skin has completely stopped flakingroughly a week. Be sure to really moisturize and top with vaselineaquaphor at night.  In regards to your beach vacation lots and lots of spf! And a hat! You are going to be at a higher risk for permanent sun damage because your skin will still be healing. If you have a retinol free antioxidant serum that is gentle be sure to use that as well for added protection. As far as ingredients go to help prevent damage I love to use vitamin c bearberry hyaluronic acid shea butter chamomile or any blend of lightening protecting and hydrating ingredients these are just some fairly common and mild ones but if you introduce any new product please test patch so you dont cause further irritation. I use a serum with most of these ingredients on myself and clients after peels when frosting occurs and get great results.Dont worry though I highly doubt you caused and permanent or lasting damage. It may just take some time to heal. ,SkincareAddiction,cgadrbg,2,t5_2tbbg

631042,0,t3_21d4wf,You should really go to a dermatologist. Do NOT pop ever! Your chance of creating a permanent scar is very high and the very tip of your nose would not be a fun place to have an awful scar.  If it keeps flaring up in exactly the same spot its possible that its an actual cyst not just cystic acne which require surgical excision to ensure that they dont return.Be sure to check out the beginners routine in the sidebar and start using a cleanser moisturizer and spot treatment patch test and introduce new products slowly and one at a time. You are doing nothing to actually treat your acne. Using only water on your face is not the same thing as actually washing it and is almost certainly contributing to your skin issues. ,SkincareAddiction,cgc00k0,1,t5_2tbbg

640385,0,t1_cgd1vyh,I would guess its because their bodies simply dont have as much hormonal fluctuation as womens bodies do once puberty stops.  This site notes that hair follicles contain large amounts of androgen receptors. When circulating androgens attach to these receptors they can overstimulate your sebaceous glands causing abnormal levels of oil on your skin. The result is more oil for your Pbacteria to digest and create pimples.  Mens bodies have higher levels of androgens so they have oilier skin.  However they have these higher levels consistently so the bacterial activity is also consistent.  Maybe the bacteria in womens bodies dont get fed as consistently and thus tend to gorge when they do.  That might explain why.Im thinking about my experience with yeast bacteria and sourdough bread starter.  Sourdough starter is always the most active after it hasnt had fresh flour added to it in a while.  Add some new flour and in a couple of hours boom it doubles.  Then when the bacteria are full it settles down again.  You could add more flour at this point but it wouldnt do anything because there arent really any hungry bacteria to eat it.  This is probably a terrible and inaccurate analogy but its my best guess.,SkincareAddiction,cgd299n,10,t5_2tbbg

661235,0,t1_cgfbv27,   If your foundation or tinted moisturizer contains sunscreen and is rated SPF  or greater then theres no need to wait unless you personally prefer to wait. From what Ive read chemical ones need to have a reaction with the skin and physical ones need to soak in.   For example mix your serum and moisturizer in the palm of your hand and apply them both to your entire face depends on the ingredients of the serum certain things need a certain pH and cannot be mixed or when they are they are not as effective.  This can speed your routine but keep in mind it is not advisable to do this with sunscreen because sun protection isnt something you want to dilute with another product well unless its another sunscreen. Do not mix sunscreens. They are very expertly formulated for stability and messing with it can make it not work very well.

I think if you use a BHA or AHA regularly it should help speed things along.  Waiting for everything to clear up is the worst though isnt it?Ive never used the cleanser you linked to but I did use his glycolic foaming cleanser for a while and besides some stinging and burning before I washed it off and extreme dryness afterwards I didnt see much of any kind of effect so I stopped using it.

705791,0,t1_cgkhfgl,Nope I dont think I would change my recommendations based on that  The products I recommended are very unlikely to cause breakouts. I might recommend the EltaMD UV Clear instead of UV Shield its really great for acne prones.The bare minerals and really any powder foundation is however unfortunately not moisturizing. As a former makeup artist myself I am guessing the moisturizing minerals is part of their marketing spiel. It is less drying than other powdered foundations but it still contains ingredients that are drying and can wick moisture from your skin. It doesnt have any ingredients that are emollient or contain any moisture at all so Im not sure how it could be adding moisture to your skin  I would recommend something more like a BB cream  its got enough moisture even if your skin is dry that it shouldnt get absorbed into your skin leaving you with a cakey look.,SkincareAddiction,cgki2mx,1,t5_2tbbg
707738,0,t1_cgkpkey,I dunno to me it looks like op already tried picking at it which is how it ended up looking like that sorry if thats not the case.

708046,0,t1_cgkn7hn,So...I have super pale very yellow skin. I know this isnt rmakeupaddicts but I gotta give some advice because I FEEL YOUR PAIN. It is so hard to find foundation matches with our skin tones!!Here are some swatches of what I have around that have worked for me. This is about  mins after application so they have dried and fully oxidized. I hate seeing swatches of things that havent settled into their final color because that isnt how it looks dammit! Also I didnt really blend them so hopefully you can kind of infer the coverage based on this from bottom to top goes light to heavy coverage. Holika Holika Aqua Petit Jelly in  Light Beige Light to medium coveage. Interesting wateryjelly texture. VERY blendable but not very buildable. Almost like a tinted moisturizer. Does NOT ever get cakey or settle into pores lt lt lt I got mine from RoseRose Shop. Oh and they also make a matching primer but dont bother  its garbage.  MUFE HD Foundation in  Marble Medium to heavy coverage buildable. Lovely powdery finish but can get cakey if applied too heavily. Try it out at a Sephora. Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer in SX My makeup swiss army knife and HG  as you can see perfect shade match for me. This as interesting bird...it is almost like a concealer in texture very thick but it is extremely blendable so you can actually use it as a foundation as well. Use a sponge I use beautyblender for best results. Very buildable. Stays put. Also unlike the other two  and basically every other foundation  does NOT contain dimethicone or pentasiloxane which both break my skin out. You can get samples here very inexpensively or just go to a Nordstrom to get shadematched.,SkincareAddiction,cgkrayk,9,t5_2tbbg

For the past year I have been using La RochePosays Anthelios  Matte Extreme Fluid for oilyacne prone skin but now I cant find it anywhere. I will probably switch to Avne SPF. Its also really easy to get RetinA from a dermatologist and it will cost you pennies or nothing with social security. Without social security I think a tube is like  euros... compared to  in the US. I have considered buying La RochePosays Serozinc but I probably wont. Im not a big fan of spray waters... Ive been using Avnes water spray and it doesnt do much for me.

723376,0,t3_22g0fb,Agree with previous poster. Sounds like PIH and the most effective way to treat hyper pigmentation is with hydroquinone. Its available over the counter in the States and Canada under different brand names but Im not sure about whether its available where you are. If not your best bet is to go see a doctor and have himher prescribe you a topical to treat PIH on an ongoing basis ie tretinoin and hydroquinone. Unfortunately if youre prone to PIH after a break out you will likely get these wherever you have a big inflammation. Sunscreen alone wont cut it because the melanin is triggered by acne not the sun. You need to stop them before they come. All other less aggressive approaches probably wont be as effective,SkincareAddiction,cgmi1zp,1,t5_2tbbg

744978,0,t3_22o4f2,Last year I borrowed my sisters aveeno face wash and broke out into horrible hives. I clearly had an allergic reaction but the hives turned into raw patches of flaky red skin once the initial reaction died down. I tried cetaphil too because I had heard it was extremely gentle but Even that was too much. I think my skin was just so bad that any type of cleansing agent irritated it. I dont know if youre familiar with the oil cleansing method. I tried it in the past and decided it wasnt for me. But until my skin healed up from the allergic reaction I washed my face with straight olive oil get coldpressed extra virgin. I would literally apply the olive oil to my face as soon as I hopped in the shower let it sit while I was washed up and gently wiperinse it off at the end of the shower. That way the oil had time to moisturize and pull the gunk out if my skin.Hope this helps! Best if luck!,SkincareAddiction,cgoykyj,1,t5_2tbbg

749578,0,t1_cgpaobo,Okay this might be a long response. First Im going to break these down into different types of productsCleansers Paulas Choice CLEAR acne cleanserExfoliants BHAStridex in the red box Paulas Choice CLEAR reg strength acne exfoliantExfoliants AHASt. Ives Exfoliating PadsAlpha Hydrox  Glycolic Enhanced LotionMoisturizers Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream Nivea CremeSunscreenShisedio Ultimate sun protection CreamSpot treatments amp Masks amp SerumsAtec Secret Clay Mask Kate Somerville EradikateSpectro Deep Pore Vanishing Lotion Vitamin E serumMad Hippie Vitamin C serumOkay so now that we have that established. A basic routine likely involves a cleanser an exfoliante a moisturizer and a sunscreen. Cleanse once or twice a day once is better for your skin generally at night. If you use only one exfoliator use it at night. A BHA is generally better at treating acne. An AHA can help with acne and also with those red spots left over after acne. You can use both in which case AHA at night BHA in the morning.After you exfoliate its time for a moisturizer make sure you wait at least  minutes after using an exfolator before you apply moisturizer. After the moisturizer in the morning you use sunscreen.To take makeup and sunscreen off at night you can use the mineral oil and then use the cleanser to remove the mineral oil.Vitamine C serums can be added in they help with left over red spots and with overall skin health. Add in the morning or at night after your AHA or BHA but before the moisturizer.Spot treatments can be applied morning andor night they can go before or after the moisturizer its up to you I prefer after. Apply them to active white heads black heads red spots or any other blemish stay clear of broken skin though it needs to be treated gently to heal.Aztec clay can be used as either a spot treatment or an all over treatment. As an all over treatment it should not be used more than once a week as it can dry out the skin.The witch hazel can be added into your routine either in the morning at night or both. It should go after your cleanser and before your AHA or BHA. However if you are already using an AHA and BHA you may find this product to be too drying in combination. Just because you could use all these products doesnt mean you need too. I would recommend starting with simply a cleanser and moisturizer. You know the mineral oil doesnt break you out so use it to remove makeup and use the cleanser than a moisturizer. Use the sunscreen in the morning as well. You can introduce the other products as need be.Make sure you patch test everything for several days before adding it into your routine. Use a product for at least  weeks before adding in a new product. This will help you figure out if any of these products make your skin worse.An additional word of warning about AHAs and BHAs. Whenif you add them into your routine start with every third day work up to every other day before using them daily or never use them daily thats fine too in order to prevent over irritation of the skin. The  Glycolic lotion is never okay to use daily. It is a once a week type of treatment only!,SkincareAddiction,cgphf0p,2,t5_2tbbg
752539,0,t1_cgptda0,. Yes you should definitely wear sunscreen with tights even if they are opaque I doubt they would provide more than the equivalent of SPF or so. If you are going to be indoors most of the day chemical sunscreens should be fine and you shouldnt need to reapply.

But yeah I realized that I can still kind of see through the tights even if theyre opaque so I guess that means that light can still go through so Ill at least use a chemical sunscreen for sure.

821316,0,t1_cgwc746,Let me try and be as detailed as possible. Please note! If youre very sensitive it might be a little too detailed and may make you squeamish. This is the advice my derm gave me plus my own experience with it. I know people will say to leave it alone and I do agree that it is best not to poke at it but sometimes it can dramatically reduce healing time and you can avoid scarring if done properly. And if youre going to pick at it you might as well do it the right way.Make sure that your skin and fingers are clean. You can even put disposable gloves on if you want to be super sanitary. Or wrap your fingers with new tissue paper. With whiteheads acne that is not painful and just a small white bump I poke it somewhat from the side with a diabetes lancet. These are sold in drugstores in boxes of like  for about . These are individually sealed and sanitized for one time use. With whiteheads it should not hurt at all. You should not be poking it very deep because most of it is already at the surface.With cystic acne the deep painful ones I use the warm compress and wait till I can see a white head form. Sometimes I use the warm compress for an extended period of time and multiple times throughout the day. When you do clearly see the white come to the surface I poke the lancet straight into the white part because the infection tends to be deeper. This may sting just a little bit. Afterwards you place your index finger from one hand on one side of the pimple and your index finger from your other hand on the other side of the pimple and you pull your skin with your fingers away from one another. If nothing comes out you popped it prematurely. If it was ready to be popped you should see white liquidy pus and possibly some sebumkeratin build up come out. When you get cystic acne you will notice that there tends to be whiteish stuff that is more dense that comes out along with the pus and sometimes a bit of blood. This is the sebumkeratin and generally what was infected and caused the blemish in the first place. If you dont see this stuff coming out your cystic acne may not start to heal because this stuff will continue to trigger bacteria infection. However I would advise against using the lancet repeatedly.Afterwards clean gently with a new tissue and use little to no pressure. Your skin should continue to produce a clear fluid. This is lymph fluid that you should NOT try and remove. Lymph fluid is what helps bring platelets to the skin that begin the healing process. You want to try and not accidentally touch this area or cover it with any bandage. You will notice that if you dealt with the pimple properly this lymph fluid will sort of harden into a kind of crystal and then fall off by itself. DO NOT pick at it. Once the crystal has fallen off you want to try and keep the area moisturized. Moist skin heals faster. The problem with squeezing inwards is that you can push more bacteria inwards and cause bruising. My derm said that with this method it is less intrusive and a lot less likely for you to injure your skin. Hope this is helpful. I very rarely scar when I do this. ,SkincareAddiction,cgxmw7b,3,t5_2tbbg

Make a paste of noxema cream lots of menthol can also use less with generic muscle run water based hand cream and laundary starch or you can pick up queen Helenes mint mud pack in your local beauty supply store.Either mixture with a bit of water to start slathering goes on your nose and the rest of the T zone once a month . Leave on until you look like a dry lake bed in August until the layer is dried cracked and literally flakes away when you move. Then vigorously scrub with a crocheted fishing line pot scrubber... Older ladies will live to make these for you... Synthetic non abrasive ones can be bought in the store if you dont have your own hidden supply of little old knotting ladies lacking a project....Once all the visible mudstuff is off your face use a nice simple triple milled bar of vegetable soap in lavendar or rosemary to gently finish cleansing the rest of your upper anatomy and finish with tepid to cool water and then a splash of Cold water to make the ores as small as possibleE. on the mon mud weeks use Parkinsons witch hazel before bedtime and after lathering face to take off any toxins from the day. Witch hazel with its amount of alcohol is ph balanced for your face and will help dissolve any come domes and leave the pores nice and small. Follow up with a water based cream such as a generic cetaphyl r or use the age old beauty secret of Olive oil massaged gently into the skin.If Witch Hazel and alcohol are too harsh for you then a solution of oz Apple Cider vinegar to oz of distilled water in a spray bottle will work just as well. spray it into your skin or onto a cotton pad to get it onto your skin and repeat with either the cream or the olive oil from above.Taken from ancient and time tested beauty routinesThe Herbalistwww.theherbalcupboard.com,SkincareAddiction,cgy0jpv,0,t5_2tbbg
833785,0,t1_cgz1bje,You dont have to talk to a makeup artist if you are confident you can match shades! There are even good concealers at drugstores which doesnt let you swatch but does lower the people aspect. Going to rmakeupaddiction and searching drugstore concealer or just concealer will give you some brand ideas which I suggest you take with you to wherever you go to lookthere are a lot of brands and it helps to have things prenarrowed. The concealer shouldnt look too dark or too light too pink or too beige for your skin tone. You tell that by swatching. You can swatch your wrist lightly or your cheek or your jawline to be super unobtrusive. Ask for a sample of primer if you get it from a makeup counter thats like a clear or whitethatrubsin liquidgel that makes the concealer look more like skin. You can apply with your finger and usually dont drag your finger to spread rather blot your finger sort of on and around the problem area and itll spread out without marks. Most concealers tend to look yellow on me so really make sure you test well. Specifically go outside and look at yourself in a mirror in natural light! Often those matches made inside dont hold up. Thats all my scattered thoughts.,SkincareAddiction,cgz1xwt,9,t5_2tbbg

883369,0,t1_ch4ol4u,With physical exfoliation youre removing dead skin cells right then and there. With chemical exfoliation youre just making those cells a little easier to shed when theyre ready to. It basically loosens the glue that holds dead skin together. Itll fall off in the same manner that it naturally would just a little sooner. Most of dust is actually dead skin. Stridex is a chemical exfoliant while a scrub is a physical exfoliant. Both of these take place on the outermost layer of dead skin.  Tret works a bit differently. It works on deeper layers of the skin and is sort of a mega exfoliant. Heres a ton of technical jargon  gtAlthough the exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown current evidence suggests that the effectiveness of tretinoin in acne is due primarily to its ability to modify abnormal follicular keratinization. Comedones form in follicles with an excess of keratinized epithelial cells.  Tretinoin promotes detachment of cornified cells and the enhanced shedding of corneocytes from the follicle. By increasing the mitotic activity of follicular epithelia tretinoin also increases the turnover rate of thin looselyadherent corneocytes. Through these actions the comedo contents are extruded and the formation of the microcomedo the precursor lesion of acne vulgaris is reduced.  Basically tret encourages your skin to turn over much quicker and causes the new skin to form in a more organized fashion.  While your skin adjusts to this it is at an increased risk for irritation which can be caused by using the Stridex. Adding another exfoliant could very well make your skin even worse. You should drop the Stridex for at least  months and dont use any exfoliants besides tret.,SkincareAddiction,ch4oxll,2,t5_2tbbg

It also might have a touch of extra fragrance in it its very light and Im not sure if Im imagining it or not it doesnt say that it is fragrance free on the back like the Skin Recovery Moisturiser so it could have some. The cream itself is not very thick so it spreads well. I used about a pea on each hand just now just did the tops and they are very soft  Interestingly I read the back and it looks like it contains physical and chemical sunscreen.

IDK if Im feeling scabs dryness or just a texture change but when I started using RetinA I stopped using masks and physical exfoliating cleanser and my skin feels different in a bad way.

Any way I could work something similar into my routine or should I just ride it out with RetinA? After my PIH and acne go away do I keep using RetinA? Could I switch to a drugstore retinol?

1070234,0,t3_26d6vb,If you started with the  you may have kind of jumped in the deep end and freaked your skin out. OR theres side ingredients in the exfoliant that is making your skin freak out. The other option is that the AHA itself is not a good type for your skin. Theres a bunch of different AHAs like glycolic acid lactic acid etc. and some people react badly to specific ones. Theres more info on AHAs in the sidebar.This website has several different exfoliants at varying strengths But I suggest you start with a lower percentage one like this so your skin can get used to it. Then if you use it up and decide you wanna reorder you can move up to a higher percentage one like this On the product pages I linked you to you can read product reviews the ingredients list and product info what the product does. This brand is all about not using fragrances or additives that many people are sensitive to so theyre generally suitable for a range of people and skin types and not too expensive.Check the back of the AHA toner you used and see what acid it uses. Glycolic acid the one in the products I linked you to is one thats fine for most people.

Unfortunately throughout the years I picked on my acne and developed some scars. I also suffer from large pores more prominent on my forehead. My question is  how can I get the texture of my forehead more even? It seems really bumpy even though there are no pimples etc.My current routine is wash face in shower with Grandpas sulfur soap I think this is why really helps me keep the acne controlled every other day. When I dont use the sulfur soap I wash with a Neutrogena face wash. I follow up with Burts bees toner really reduces appearance of pores more than anything  Ive  used. Then I moisturizer with Trader Joes all natural organic coconut oil. I dont use that much makeup only conceal areas and use a light powder or tinted moisturizer and I never sleep with makeup on.

A gentle cleanser combined with a BHA and a good moisturizer whether it be the moisturizer in the beginners guide or something else can usually diminish the overproduction of oil and give you back your skin.As an aside You need some way to reduce the stress in your life.

The antioxidants or minerals not sure which are super calming and redness tends to be minimized when I remove it. Its a pain to remove so I use OCM with hemp oil. And the zinc is I believe slightly beneficial for acne. It tends to be a little drying but I am OK with that since Im on the oily side anyway. That the difficulty of removal and the cost are my only complaints but I love it in any case. ,SkincareAddiction,chx8284,1,t5_2tbbg

HUGE difference. Livestrong is not a source BTW. Ill have someone look into the sources on the first link to see if those sources actually say that ascorbic acid is an AHA. If I am wrong Id like to find out. But so far I havent been able to find solid evidence for LAA or vitamin c being an AHA.  There is misinformation running rampant here as well for example physical sunscreens work by reflecting rays not true.

BHAs are better at getting rid of plugs and sebacious filaments this is why they are better for those with oily skin they are more prone to plugs and oiliness  BHAs can penetrate this like AHAs cant.

1213561,0,t3_27ytaj,Im assuming youre talking about the Clear acne line  week trial since I didnt see any others on the website. The best way to introduce new products is one at a time so if your skin starts getting worse you know whats causing it. I would replace your cleanser with the PC one for a couple days and if it doesnt irritate add the exfoliant once or twice a day after you cleanse. Now Im kind of confused because the exfoliant in the kit is  BHA so did you buy another  BHA product? If so I would use the one in the Clear kit it has a lighter texture. Finally after a couple of days of that add the . benzoyl peroxide cream. I find it a bit drying so I only use it to spot treat but you can apply it over large areas of your face if youre comfortable with that. Good luck!,SkincareAddiction,ci656z3,1,t5_2tbbg

1322992,0,t3_298dtv,I am  years old and I have only started giving a shit about my skin within the past few weeks.  It was always bad for various reasons but meh looks arent exactly my strong suit.  I did wear sunscreen and see a dermatologist for cancer checks because I am pale and had some bad sunburns as a kid with visible damage on my shoulders now.  That was the extent of my skincare routine.  Splash of water gob of sunscreen done.  Then I took a trip to the king of prussia mall where the nearest Lush store is.  Im a perfume junkie and even now after their products hurt my face I love their perfumes.  While I was there I figured Id get some skin products most of which were scrubby scrubs and one of which was a bar of charcoal soap with bits of exfoliating stuff in it so sharp that I looked like I got attacked by a kitten after washing my face  and I continued using it.  If I have one nice thing to say about the experience its that it forced the skincare issue I had been ignoring.  I had to go back to the dermatologist with an angry stinging flaking face that got so bad Id occasionally wake up with blood on the pillow  where I received advice that pretty much mirrors what everyone says on this sub.

1379008,0,t3_29webl,If it is hormonal acne theres not much you can do topically to stop it especially if its cystic. Im on mobile and dont currently have a working laptop so this wont be as in depth as it could be.  Basically there is no miracle product. The only way its going to be a miracle to you is if you do spot tests and only add in a product one at a time to decide if your skin likes it. If youre throwing all these fancy products at it at once or randomly it might just be freaking confused. Also do the research yourself  do a Cosdna rating on all the products to see which might be the best and be very mindful of the ingredients. Look for typically bad ingredients and also look to see after youve done spot tests and introduced one at a time if you may have an allergy to an ingredient. First off stop pickingpopping. For realz. Now youre going to have to treat PIH and scarring instead of just treating the acne. Start slowly. Start by only using one cleanser right now and nothing else to see if its causing a reaction. I dont know much about yours that you have listed if I was in a drugstore aisle Id probably choose the aveno by impulse. Read the ingredients on the back and do a quick search for things like fragrance alcohols menthol or sulphates. These are bad things that you want to try and avoid. You want a cleanser that will remove your makeup and not make your skin feel tight or squeaky after you rinse.Try using the Jojoba oil you have listed in the moisturizer section at your cleanser and your moisturizer as instructed in the OCM sidebar link!! Thats the best thing I think. Definitely keep up on your moisture too. After youve used only the cleanser for at least a week and you do not get any negative side effects then start adding a chemical exfoliant in. Id say the BHA but at ? I dont know how effective that is. I use the  SA stridex pads. The AHA will be a little more harsh but also supposed to be more hydrating and TBH to me it looks like your skin is a bit thirsty. I hear great things about the buffering lotion but once again spot test. If you have Epiduo then it mustve been prescribed by a doctor? What made you stop using that? How old is it? Is it expired? ,SkincareAddiction,cip56ry,3,t5_2tbbg

1481373,0,t3_2b5fdu,Hi! First Ill just say this might be a better post for rmakeupaddicts because Im sure a lot of people there have played around with the different bare minerals foundations. Im currently using BareSkin though and can tell you my personal experience I kind of like it but its not my HG. BareSkin has decent build able coverage which is a good thing. It promises a dewy finish which I love in theory but sometimes if my skin is dry it will accentuate the flakes. However it does blend well and hide my PIH. Its also very light so I forget I have it on. The company promises that it is good for your skin I cant comment on that in particular because Im using actual skin care products to improve my skin texture etc.I actually was really nervous about getting a new foundation since my pervious one broke me out horribly so I went in to Sephora and asked them for a sample of this one. The sales lady was super nice and understanding and gave me a weeks worth in a tiny tube! I would highly recommend you do the same so you can test it out beforehand! Good luck!,SkincareAddiction,cj1yrwb,2,t5_2tbbg

When I started using Alpha Hydrox  glycolic acid there was definitely an improvement in hyperpigmentation.One last tip  MAKE SURE you are using a sunscreen.

1530427,0,t1_cj7ny1o,gtExcept that pores dont open or close they lack any form of muscles that would contract to do that.Im still not sure I buy this entirely. I understand pores dont have muscles but it makes sense that they would open with the application of heat because everything expands with the application of heat its a basic principle of physics. In addition applying heat to the skin increases bloodflow and causes it to swell slightly increasing the skins surface area  which one could reasonably assume would have an effect on pore size and thus the ease with which things enter and exit the pores.I use warm not hot water to open my pores while Im washingOCMing which seems to make it easier to get grits out and then cold not freezing water to close my pores when I rinse before applying my topicals. Applying cold water has a visible impact on the size of my pores reduces bloodflow and visibly diminishes my redness it has a better effect than any product Ive used actually. Yes this runs the slight risk of drying out my natural skin barrier but so does every other product I use to combat my acne and I have to moisturize really well after my routine anyways.Please downvote this comment as per sub rules since I dont have sources for any of this just my own scientificallybased speculation.,SkincareAddiction,cj846q9,15,t5_2tbbg

You should really get in the habit of sunscreen every morning and to reapply a good compromise is a moisturizer with spf that doesnt break you out. Even driving in the car or sitting in a room with windows will expose you to UV rays.  SPF  is usually recommended here.Absolutely double that advice if you use an exfoliator AHA BHA retinol etc. The exfoliator takes off a dead layer of skin which would usually disperse the rays a little. If youre using an exfoliator a higher SPF is so important just so you dont have any time that youre exposed between reapplying.,SkincareAddiction,cje9h4g,1,t5_2tbbg

Sodium Laureth Sulfate  its fine for a lot of peoples skin but can still be irritating if its mixed with other potentially irritating ingredients used in high concentration or used on sensitive skin like mine.. Fragrance  the fragrance is really strong in this one and its the th ingredient. Fragrance can be irritating for a lot of people. It definitely irritates my skin.Plus there are random herbal extracts in this that can possibly be irritating.

It can also in theory loosen things like plugs while doing so this is what Ive been told but I havent seen any science on that if anyone has any.  Thats basically it.  There are lots of clay masks some as inexpensive as the Queen Helenes and the Mint makes your face feel cool and tingly but it doesnt really have any purpose other than that it can also be irritating.So just dissolving excess oilpossibly loosening plugs and blockages in pores making them easier to clear up.,SkincareAddiction,cjiibyx,5,t5_2tbbg

You should replace it with a gentle cleanserCeraVe foaming facial cleanser is often recommended here. BP and Tretinoin are both very drying you really need to be including a moisturizer. My guess is you have dried you skin out and that is why the sunscreen is burning you so much. CeraVe in the tub is one that a lot of people in this sub use. It is on the thicker side but it isnt greasy and dries matte. You might want to start only washing your face once a dayat night only. ,SkincareAddiction,cjl1qcl,1,t5_2tbbg

So when I got back from traveling about a month ago I started Skinceuticals  retinol every other day then added in Alpha Hydrox gel which has lactic acid in it about a week ago. Ever since I added the retinol Ive been breaking out. Its minor and in places I usually break out so Im praying its a purge. I am also hoping that the lactic helps get rid of the closed comodones.

When that happens I turn to this bad boy. It helps calm my skin down like woah. I recently flew directly from India to Newark while suffering from the worst allergen reaction on my skin thanks to the monsoon rain that had finally arrived that morning. I couldnt bring my tub of the repair cream because its too big so I had to make do with cocoa butter which only helped for short periods of time. By the time I finally got home the skin on my chest and arms was super red and bumpy and itchy. I took a cold shower and used this wash and I instantly felt a million times better. The weird thing is that its not listed on their website but their website says theyre selling it?  Ultra Repair Lip Therapy Really thick lip balm. I use this along with ELFs lip exfoliator to help keep my lips smooth.Ultra Repair Cream What I really love about this moisturizer is that it has colloidal oatmeal as the first ingredient which is great for soothing skin.

1678149,0,t1_cjql7tg,Doubleedged razors are also called safety razors. They look like thisTheyre also hella cheap in the long run because the blades last longer and you can buy them in huge quantities.

There is a bit of a learning curve in using them but once you get used to them theyre just as quick to use and substantially safer. I used to slice my legs all the time with cartridge razors. Ive had a total of one shaving cut in  years from my DE and that was because the cat startled me. The main thing with them is to use a proper shaving soap or cream  not the canned ones either. You need a brush to build up a lather properly rwickededge has more advice on the brush types and brands but theyre completely worth it no matter where youre shaving.

Sometimes I wear sunscreen I know shame on me for not using it everyday but Im thinking its breaking me out or maybe Im not removing it properly at night?In the evenings I always cleanse with the Babor cleanser only one cleanse. Do I need another? And then Im confused with what to put on next. Sometimes I use the acid on my whole face and sleep with this. Sometimes the cerave pm lotion.I tried to use the acid every night but it seems to be too harsch and drying. So I tried using it every other night but it seems like its really good for evening out the skintone but not for exfoliating if that make sense? So I then tried to use the daily microfoliant one night and then the acid the next night but this was too much for my skin. ,SkincareAddiction,cjuhr22,1,t5_2tbbg

1722048,0,t1_cjw7mqj,Yes quite sure. Its actually a newish routine that Ive adopted over about the last year or so. Before that I was just using my clarisonic with neutrogena soap and finishing with moisturizer twice a day.By midday I could go through  blotting sheets. And another  before I went home.Since Ive started being... um... a little extreme with my skin my acne has almost disappeared my scars are starting to fade and I dont get oily until the end of the day. On the rare occasions usually over the summer that I get oily in the afternoon  or  blotting sheets takes care of it until I get home.Im very oily. For instance I only use all natural vegetable soaps on my body and moisturize once a day after my shower and my chest back and upper arms are actually greasy. Literally my body gets greasier than most peoples faces.And I didnt start using all of these products at once either. I would add one and if it still didnt produce the desired effect I would add another.Its been a process and I know its probably not one that this sub would necessarily approve of but it really has made me much happier with my face!,SkincareAddiction,cjw885p,2,t5_2tbbg

It could also be an ingredient in the exfoliation products but not the BHA or AHA themselves. Did you start using them both at the same time? Introduce things more slowly. If the stridex did nothing for you but didnt slow you down the AHA sounds like the offender more likely. Id stop using both exfoliators to see if they go away.

Or could it be a combination of some of the products?Sidenote A couple weeks ago I started using Stridex in the red box again also used in the past with no issues alternating days with the St. Ives pads but that caused closed comedones as well.HELP!,SkincareAddiction,ck5ky22,1,t5_2tbbg

1799460,0,t1_ck5tssg,Hey there!  Just want to quickly point out that Mirena is actually still a form of hormonal birth control. It contails levonorgestrel a synthetic form of progestogen.  It does have a lot less of it than the pill thoughgtMirena releases the hormone at an initial rate of  micrograms per day ... In comparison oral contraceptives can contain  micrograms of levonorgestrel. The hormonal IUD releases the levonorgestrel directly into the uterus as such its effects are mostly paracrine rather than systemic. Most of the hormone stays inside the uterus and only a small amount is absorbed into the rest of the body.From wikipedia warning graphic animated image of a cervix on that page!,SkincareAddiction,ck5z5dy,1,t5_2tbbg

I believe that it acts on your skins melanin to achieve this but Im not sure. Correct me if Im wrong I dont mind learning more details either way!

Basically I only recommend them for people who have an event to go to and will be wearing a backless dress or people who have some very clogged poresacne. What a typical back facial entails will be a thorough cleanse exfoliation treatment  I use a bhaaha treatment because I dont like scrubs but some places just do a scrub scalp massage while the bha sits extractions with light steam sometimes this goes before your bha depending on the type of product they use treatment mask massaged in and sunscreen or moisturizer to finish.Your back skin is more forgiving than your facial skin so light extractions and light steam are usually tolerable by most people. But I really do not suggest getting one unless you have one of the two reasons I mentioned above. So many people go into this expecting it to be a massage that also involves cleansing the skin but its not.

Mainly bc I enjoy it I use this as my relaxing time it gives me a hint of color and I actually found that it helped a lot with my back acne probably bc it will dry your skin. For myself I use the lay down kind turn off the face bronze and never stay more than  minutes. To answer your questions.The stand up kind will give you less tan lines around your butt and armpits. I also dont know if you have an option to turn off a face section in the stand up kind. This kind also tends to have stronger bulbs so if you are really pale you dont want to start with that. . As far as results it really depends on your skin type. I am really pale and started at  minutes in a standard bed and built my way up to  over about  months. This way I never burned but still saw small changes with each season. . Lotion is important to not dry out your skin. I use babymineral oil AFTER my season using it before will damage the acrylic in the bed. I also still use sunscreen on my face and on my tattoos but I have never gotten much out of using the lotions specific for tanning. . I havent noticed my hair change at all.For my last few words of advise. Always wear your goggles even if you think you look funny and always clean your bed BEFORE and after you use it. tldr I tan bc it makes me happy.

Then my doc upped my dose for spiro because my acne was at a stall not worse but just the same and I have had no issues.

But it sounds like the combination of products you use is drying.  BHA   BHA  allover tea tree oil  a lot of drying. You replaced a cleanser Ivory soap with an exfoliant Neutrogena  BHA. My suggestion is to replace the Neutrogena wash with an actual cleanser which is my next step too once I finish my Cerave Tub trial period. Sidebar Link!

I use CeraVe Foaming Cleanser in both mornings and nights to wash my face I dont use a BHA anymore I do use AHA Alpha Hydrox  Glycolic in both morning and night I use a Salicylic Acid Peel  once a week so far it has helped Ive only used it for two weeks After the peel I use a MBD Black Pearl mask mainly because its soothing and very moisturizing which is perfect after a peel. I moisturize with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream People here vastly recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Cream because it has ceramides and its pretty good.  For sunscreen I tried Cetaphil Dermacontrol its too oily and I didnt like it because it stung my eyes. I tried LOreal Ideal Moisture with SPF didnt like it because it was heavy. I tried both Biore Aqua Rich and Biore Perfect Face Milk I loved both thoroughly they are light milky smooth they feel great on the skin and stay matte like its nobodies business.  I use the Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel toner. No reason in special for the cucumber aside from me loving how it smells. It has helped me some with redness and inflammation. My routine is as it followsAM Cleanse with CeraVe Apply Witch Hazel toner After it dries apply AHA wait for it to absorb  min Apply Cetaphil Moisturizer Apply sunscreen Makeup if anyPM Remove makeup and sunscreen with Ponds Cold Cream cleanser Wash with CeraVe Apply witch hazel Apply AHA Moisturize Every Friday night each week Wash with CeraVe Clean face with rubbing alcohol my face is super oily Apply Salicylic acid peel for  min Rinse acid Apply my beauty diary sheet mask for  min Moisturize with Cetaphil Apply thin layer of Aquaphor And thats it my skin has gotten way better and something that has also helped millions is that I went on the pill since my acne is hormonal.Remember to patch test and to not abuse your skin the gentler the better!!!!

My roommate has terrible skin and only recently stopped using some awful walnut scrub that made her skin look worse.Theres good recs in the FAQ and I think the key is to keep your routine simple and not overdo product usage. Unfortunately youre only going to know if something works by trying the product and being patient. I know people myself included had some luck with BHA to keep pimples at bay. Just remember that just because a little is good that doesnt mean that a lot is better!!! I used it twice a week and it still was a little irritating. Just monitor how your skin reacts. I had straight up boils on my cheeks jawline and between my brows. I basically followed the beginners routine with a few tweaks  AM splash waterlight  moisturizer good sunscreenPM eye makeup remover coconut oil cleanse mild foam cleanser twice weekly a BHA then finish with light moisturizer or argan oil in winterLast thing I always thought I had really oily skin but I recently washed my face then didnt put anything or touch my face for an hour. Ive read a few places that this a good way of determining your skin type and it turns out my skin is closer to normalslightly dry. So its possible that your skin type has changed a bit and youre using products not formulated for your skin type.  Really last thing horseshoe crabby makes a really good point thats worth remembering. Dont switch everything out all at once. I would probably start with the cleanser not bar soap! something gentle like CereVe or Cetaphil. Then maybe try some AHA or BHA products. Again just keep track of how your skin reacts. Ok I think thats it! Phew!Good luck!!!,SkincareAddiction,cl3ft9t,3,t5_2tbbg

2117069,0,t3_2j1pp2,You need to buy this. I was skeptical and it totally helped me shed a billion gross layers of skin. Callous removers and scrapers almost seem to irritate the skin more and make it tougher. This soaks into the dead skin and makes it come off in sheets. All you do is put the little bag on your feet pour the liquid in tie it closed and go watch a movie for a couple hours. My fiances feed are s and the bags fit but we put a second plastic bag over to make sure it didnt leak. We scotch taped the top of the bags shut watched a two hour movie rinsed it off and went to bed. Nothing happened for about a week but then I noticed my feet getting super scratchy like velcro. The next day my skin started peeling. The next week I was shedding skin all over. Hot showers helped but still took a while. A week after both our feet were baby smooth. I cannot recommend this product enough. The next thing you need to do is take a hard look at your shoes. Your feet are growing calluses to protect themselves from whatever youre doing to them so that needs to change. Good luck! ,SkincareAddiction,cl8xbu2,1,t5_2tbbg

2117732,0,t1_cl9097m,I tried looking for it too but couldnt tell. It does have alcohol in it so maybe that is drying your skin a little. But it also has LHA which makes me a little envious because LHA is one of the newer chemical exfoliants. Not many products are utilizing it yet at a cost affordable rate. Maybe try using it every other night and see if the irritation lessens? Since Im not sure how strong LHA is compared to AHA or BHA. Found this as far as side effects of the alcohol Alcohol causes freeradical damage dryness and irritation.So it makes sense that when you increased your usage to daily that your skin maybe wasnt ready for it or is over exfoliated.

Im not sure if it was the ingredients in the alcohol though I definitely noticed more breakouts when I drank beer as opposed to hard liquor but getting drunk also made me too lazy to wash my makeup off which surely contributed to my horrible skin.

2208346,0,t3_2kebza,Oh yes many have.Healthy skin can functionally protect itself from the elements and from the naturally present bacterial flora that acne gets its name from p. acnesIt sounds like your skins naturally protective barrier is damaged. When this happens it can lead to overproduction of sebum this is often your skin freaking out and overcompensating trying to repair itself and having confusingly dry skin other times but also breakouts! As many SCAers will tell you oily skin can actually be caused by dehydrated or damaged skin. It sounds like this may be the case with you. In the summer when its humid your skin pumps out oil to compensate for its damaged barrier enough that its fine but in the winter when they drier climate sucks away more moisture from your face breakouts happen because bacteria is getting through. BP is highly drying and irritating so the fact that BP made it worse is particularly telling  it suggests that your breakouts are linked to the health of your skins naturally protective barrier.First start with the seemingly counterintuive. Even when your face is oily  stop stripping it with all that harsh stuff!!! Your skins churning out oil because its attempting to create a moisture barrier! Over on the sidebar are a whole ton of resources but I suggest you check out the product reccs within the routines. First find a nice gentle cleanser. Acne cleansers are usually a waste of money because any acnefighting compounds take time to work and are best left on the skin. In your facewash... most of that goodness goes down the drain. The best acnefighting products are left on your face so they have time to do their work.Now get out that toner flip it over and read the ingredients. Im gonna bet it has some form of alcohol in it. Thats bad! People like alcohol because it dries really fast and dries out their face and because they mistakenly think that stinging means its working. But alcohol is really not good for your skin especially in high amounts like in most western toners. Scientific research shows that it damages your skin and contributes to aging! So dont use it! Its making your face worse not better.And of course find a good moisturizer. Counterintuitive again I know but lots of SCAers have been through this same spiel and theyve found that moisturizing their skin has led to it being less oily. Helping your skin repair itself and function as it should means helping it keep that acnecausingbacteria at bay too. So find something with good humectant properties and lots of occlusives and skinidentical ingredients. If youre acneprone and afraid of breaking out you can even use straight up vaseline at night. So recap step one  stop using harsh drying stuff on your skin trying to fight the oil. Its just a shortterm solution and its hurting your skin! Treat the underlying cause for your skins oil production and it should receed. Step  use gentle highlymoisturizing products to help your skin rebuild its barrier and regain its healthy functioning. It will take time. Most of all help your skin heal. ,SkincareAddiction,clkj9fp,7,t5_2tbbg

2216362,0,t3_2ki4ww,If you didnt have problems until recently the Yes to Grapefruit moisturizer is a more likely culprit than the Alba Botanica cleanser since you added it more recently it sounds like you were using Alba Botanica for aver a month with no issues so its probably not a problem product for you.  Stop using the Yes to Grapefruit and see if the irritation improves and dont add a new product in the meantime since the new product could cause you issues as well if you were using a different moisturizer before go back to that otherwise go back to not using a moisturizer.AHAs make you photosensitive so dont add any until youve begun using a sunscreen of at least spf  sunscreen is also the best way of preventing dark spots age spots etc.  Also it looks like those brown spots are just freckles?  Freckles can be a sign of sun damage in which case sunscreen will be the biggest help but sometimes theyre just there and theres not much you can do about them.

I know it smells nice but it is phototoxic and potentially irritating.The rest depends on your skin type.  Castor oil can be quite drying but I find when I use it in limited quantities it makes my skin soft.  Jojoba is my favorite!  It is compositionally quite similar to your skins sebum so theres less of a chance itll break you out.  I cant speak to any of the other oils because Ive never used them but one of the mods is it uInYourLibrary ? uses sunflower oil with an emollient so it rinses off and she says good things about it.So definitely PATCH TEST any of the oils you decide to go with.

2264071,0,t3_2l4lmd,Heres where I would start having dealt with acne in a similar form as yours albeit not as pronounced. I would ditch the extreme temperatures while you wash your face as echoed on this subreddit its better to wash with warm water. . Id also ditch the Clearasil cleanser and just pick up a really basic gentle cleanser CeraVe and Neutrogena make some good ones IMO. This could help reduce irritationredness as a lot of acne cleansers contain irritating ingredients menthol fragrances etc and the acne fighting ingredients they do include dont stay on your face long enough to actually do anything. Thus just getting washed down the drain. . Review the order you apply your products and once you sort that out add sunscreen! This will also help with scarring and redness.. Consider adding a topical retinol product to also help with fading scars and redness. These usually come in the form of antiwrinkle at the drugstore or you could also see a dermatologist and get a prescription.. Lastly patience is key skin can take awhile to respond and adjust to products and routines. But at the same time it only can with consistency. Getting frustrated?

You want to already have been chemically exfoliating the less irritating everyday way before you go for a peel and part of that is prepping your skin and building its tolerance up for the peel!  And once your skin can handle the peel some people do have to really build their tolerance for peels more than others while you dont have to continue with the daily exfoliation doing so really does offer the best results.

2344924,0,t3_2m72dp,When you say a version of tretinoin what do you mean? If theyre on an oral retinoid were talking a somewhat different kettle of fish.Anyhoo dryness is absolutely something you can expect from a retinoid or tretinoin if you arent moisturising adequately. The effect of the drug is basically to increase skin turnover so old and hence dry skin accumulates on top. While mine isnt visible some days when I moisturize the outer layer will just roll away while Im smoothing in my moisturiser almost like the last bits of a face mask. Kinda gross now that I type that out but good god does my skin look glowy and lovely for it.Re sunscreen and sun avoidance its absolutely critical. While sunscreen is critical for anyone concerned with the health of their skin whilst treated with tretinoin you are far more susceptible to sun damage. I hereby reassure you that if you apply a high SPF sunscreen adequately and avoid sun you will avoid any such ill effects. ,SkincareAddiction,cm1jlp5,6,t5_2tbbg

2498478,0,t1_cmjsmqz,So this is going to be controversial advice.I think the single greatest thing I did for my picking habit was learning how to pop pimples the correct way. Like wash hands sterilize needle lance gently through the side squeeze GENTLY care for resulting wound. At some point I realized that I had been trying to break the habit for more than half my life and it wasnt working so I needed to find a way to minimize the damage. The correct way is time consuming and eventually I found the ritual of doing it correctly as calming as actually picking which means that I spent less time clawing at my skin. Doing it the correct way means that picking one pimple isnt as likely to cause a whole bunch of new pimples which was always a BIG problem for me so over time I had fewer and fewer pimples and therefore fewer opportunities to pick. Now that my skin is about  clear I have a whole new source of motivation to try to overcome the compulsion to pick.So again super controversial advice. Everyone elses mileage may totally vary.

She would have been right except I was doing so many things wrong and I kinda had all these bad habits and conditions that I did not tend to because I was hoping that itd all just pass.Then my condition sank to what you see in the first two images.I was pestering my mother to take me to a dermatologist but she never got around to it due to sheer laziness. When we did book a derm we cancelled because we did not have the money to give upwards of  aussie dollars. So we then just saw our GP.The GP was very nice he gave me some antibiotics of which I cannot recall the name brand or active ingredient Doxycycline and some Epiduo active ingredient Benzoyl Peroxide which I applied nightly for a month after washing my face with Cetaphil and cold water.This went on for a while then I read the wiki here and it gave me loads of advice. I learnt to Put on sunscreen always every day all the time to dampen the visual distinction of acne scars the suns bad mmkay? Changewash my pillowcases bedsheet and blanket so all that shit that I come across doesnt smear and fester all over my body for several hours Avoid using hot water when showering for prolonged periods of time it will fuck with the oils on your skin and remove protective barriers this also helped with my back acne it removed quite a fair bit Avoid facewashes that make your skin super tight and remove all oils thats part of what fucked up my skin in the first place DONT FUCKING TOUCH YOUR FACE EVER AT ALL FOR WHATEVER REASON NO MATTER WHAT UNLESS YOU ARE WASHING IT YOU WILL MAKE IT WORSE!!

Secondly I use my serum then thirdly I use my lotion which I have recently switched to simply brand because my cerave started to aggravate my eczema for some reason.. Then apply my makeup as normal. And yes I wait at least  mins between steps just to make sure it all soaks in and works its magic.. Then at night I started using the balm makeup break up eye makeup remover  I have found vasalene is almost identical to this product but a tad thicker i hop in the shower and wash my face AFTER I wash my hair  the oils from your hair washing out will wash down on to your face  and I dont like the idea of being in steam with my foundationpowder on i think it seeps into your pours that way. So I wash my face second after my hair and do the rest of my showering. After my shower I pat my face dry dont rub because it will irritate I then apply my serum wait  then apply my lotion wait  then use my soot treatment yes to tomatoes then change my pillow case and go to sleep. Every Wednesday I exfoliate my face by using a sponge like one you could buy at ulta for face cleansing I cant afford a battery operated brush but that might work awesomely I use my regular cleanser for this step. Sometimes on weekends I use a hydrating mask like the ones also from ulta in a little pouch that are like a dollar. I usually dont use the whole pouch so I tape it closed compleatly sealed up for another use. Also try and replace your sponge monthly if you decide to get some for hygienic purposes.

2560249,0,t1_cmsp05r,Definitely not. Trust me on this.....There are basically  approaches. If you happen to catch a cyst during its incipient stage of formation. Use ice on itgently  times a day  benzoyl peroxide. once a day  aspirin for inflammation and pain. Its very exhausting sadly.. You are sure the bugger is beyond the stage for ice its time to use warm compresses to bring it to a head. DO NOT touch or squeeze trust me.....its bad. Do it  times a day should come to a head. When it pops apply a hydrocolloidal bandage for it to heal and pray it doesnt scar. IMO dont try to lance or prick needles into it its almost never worth it.... Cysts almost always heal the best when they pop themselves and then its like there was nothing there in a day or so except the pih ofc.. Too bigpainfulpersisting for weeks? Rush to doctor might need surgical intervention cus it really can be fatal if infection reaches blood stream.  ,SkincareAddiction,cmsrfb0,2,t5_2tbbg

2675993,0,t3_2qnmiq,I highly doubt sunscreens having any negative effect on the beard. That said I have never seen any empirical evidence showing contemporary sunscreens having realistic negative effects on skinhair.I use SPF  every day and it hasnt effected my facial growth or the stubble beard I like to sport from time to time or even a clean shaven face.Just one thing to be conscious of when having a beard is keeping the skin underneath well maintained ie cleansed and moisturized. So maybe just use a basic cleanser whatever other skin products you like and finish it off with an SPF in the morning every day. Important to note here is to get an SPF that doesnt have too thick or sticky of a texture that it might get gummed up or be difficult to massage around the beard area. At night you can cleanse again and Ive heard a lot of guys having great success with Jojoba oil as a beard conditioner just rubbed in at night time. The oil should keep the hair soft and the skin underneath well moisturized. A lot of companies will try to sell special beard shampoos and oils and what not but they arent necessary and usually contain a bunch of fragrance and junk.,SkincareAddiction,cn7vgwe,1,t5_2tbbg

Like use these in the morning and these before you go to bed.Thanks anyone who helps.,SkincareAddiction,cn8gjao,1,t5_2tbbg
2680598,0,t1_cn8gjao,It really depends on your skin. You can use a cleanser both AM and PM or you can it in the PM and splash with water in the AM. Moisturizer twice a day is generally a good idea unless you are very oily. Daily exfoliants are tricky. Some people use them twice a day but thats usually something you have to work up to. I rec starting with them every other day at night and working up to once every day. If you feel you need more exfoliation after that then you can work up to twice a day.,SkincareAddiction,cn8h3r4,1,t5_2tbbg

2850115,0,t1_cns1vpv,There are some pills that are prescribed specifically to treat acne. Dianette CilestOrthocyclen and Yasmin are some examples. Remember that BC has different names depending what country youre in so do some googling. Spironolactone is another drug that treats hormonal acne through antiandrogens although it is not a form of BC. Unfortunately with BC although we can carefully choose a pill it is impossible to say that this or that pill will cure your acne you just have to try them and see. BC pills work to reduce excess sebum so they work best paired with other acne treatments like topical or oral antibiotics or things like BP azelaic acid etc. Avoid pills containing norethisterone as this has a high androgenic effect.

In my experience extractions are almost always part of facial as is steam.  They can cause problems but people leave relaxed with glowy skin and no pesky blackheads  so theyre happy.  Its similar with cuticles.  I asked my podiatrist about doing something about my cuticles and her reaction was Leave  them alone.  Theyre there for a reason. But if I get a manicure or pedicure its taken for granted they I want pushed back trimmed etc.So to some extent to be successful ie stay employed and retain clients estheticians have to go along with certain things because if they try to educate clients on why extractions arent a good idea then the client probably going to go to another esthetician who does.

Then finally i apply a light later of a humectant gel type product to moisturise currently hyaluronic acid. Humectants absorb moisture from the surrounding environment instead of laying down a blanket of moisture on alreadyoily skin like emollients so are more suitable for oily skin.

3020166,0,t3_2uqx2l,I think I asked this yesterday but I posted too late and Im a little bit desperate because my skins condition is terrible and I truly need a moisturizer recommendation. I have dehydrated combo skin weather and stripping products are the cause and I recently bought CeraVe cream in the tub and the foaming cleanser. The cream in the tub broke me out immediately after using it my face felt itchy and little whiteheads started appearing. My face is back to normal but I still desperately need a moisturizer. Im still testing the CeraVe foaming cleanser but I think its a little stripping for me because yesterday I used it and my face felt oily as always. So what moisturizer would you recommend me? Would CeraVe PM or AM be a good option? And is there some cleanser you could recommend me too?

3035579,0,t3_2uxe5o,Often times oily skin is a result of skin dehydration. I know it seems counterintuitive. Do not use a scrub with exfoliating beads  those are only going to aggravate your redness. Opt for a gentler face wash many people recommend CetaphilCerraVe for oily skin I personally use Murad AntiAging Acne face wash and then use a chemical exfoliant like Stridex or similar. Over time this will help to fade your scars and manage your acne. A vitamin c serum may help with your flakiness by drawing extra moisture to your skin. Try something with hyaluronic acid. If you like your current moisturizer then stick with it. When applying makeup to flaky skin try spritzing the dry flaking areas with MAC Fix or a moisturizing toner. Either directly onto the skin before applying foundation or you can spot apply with a little synthetic brush. However and this is  honesty I would give yourself a break  from what I can see in these photos there is barely any scarring or redness showing through your makeup. Oftentimes and Im guilty of this as well we tend to focus on our hyperpigmentation because were so used to looking at it and obsessing over it.

I was wondering if this community thinks that applying it every day or for two days and then having one day break would be okay for my skin. So far I have not noticed any rashes or breakouts on my skin from using this product. Also Ive heard of people buying niacinamide tablets and dissolving then in water and then adding then to a cream to produce a cream with a concentration of about  niacinamide.

3112284,0,t3_2vsiis,They look like PIE which is post inflammatory erythema which are red spots caused by things like acne and picking at acne too.  Its different from PIH post inflammatory hyperpigmentation which is more purple.  One of the main issues with PIE is that things like AHAs and other chemical exfoliation methods sadly wont get rid of them.  The only methods for getting rid of them would be to have a pulsed dye laser treatment done at a dermatologist or to wait for them to fade over time.  However in the mean time starting a good routine will help prevent acne that can cause more PIE.

When it first started they thought anything acidic would trigger it. I have recently learned that I am allergic to lemon  eliminating it from diet has helped me enormously. It amuses me that perioral dermatitis simply means around the mouth rash. Its a rash with a location. edit to be clear eliminating lemon helped mostly with digestion.

3129109,0,t3_2t2cpu,A  post about curing skin boils with Triple Antibiotic Ointment into the nose and ears.gt YEA   My family became plagued with boils for many years while working in Romanian Hospitals. I really believe I have come up with a viable cure for boils. The concept of iodine or any other topical treatment is it kills the infection to some degree. If you place triple antibiotic ointment in your nose where staph grows and in your ears you will cut the spreading of it. Scrub you skin with an rough washcloth and antibiotic body wash. Bleach your tub every time you use it so others and yourself will not be reinfected. Staph grows in your nose ears and other warm wet places but mostly on your skin. It appears to be external and that is where you have to fight it. It is highly contagious.Triple anti biotic like Neosporin seems to be the cure when placed in the nose in pea sized amounts. We beat it after a long battle very quickly after starting this treatment and this method has kept us free and helped others. It is proven to really be a answer to the boil problem.,SkincareAddiction,combw4d,1,t5_2tbbg

Make sure you patch test both oils separately before adding them into your routine.

3149013,0,t1_coodmi5,The pillowcase thing is definitely a thing along with comforters sheets stuffed animals. Basically anything that could touch your face for the large amount of time you spend sleeping needs to be clean. Lots of folks have multiple pillows and flip the pillow for two nights out of one case. Others use a towel or tshirt over the pillow and change it every night. It can make a really big difference!I know the volume of info here is like a tidal wave but carry on! It boils down to this you need a cleanser moisturizer and sunscreen to start. The sidebar has great links on choosing each of those. MAKE SURE YOU PATCH TEST FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE USING ANYTHING FULL FACE. Also only introduce one new product each month. That way if a product causes you problems you know exactly which one it is and can jettison it. Otherwise you have to stop everything and start over. Give the sidebar a read with the goals of identifying a single product you want to try in each of the above three categories. Take before pictures for comparison and start patch testing one product at a time. Read the section on the oil cleansing method as well as see if it interests you. Many people have great results with it.  Once you have those three you can get into AHAs and BHAs which can really help out with acne. Then there is Vitamin C retinoids hyaluronic acid etc. All these help. None of them alone is a magic bullet usually. If all of this is still just driving you bonkers there is a service called Pocketderm also on the sideboard that you may be interested in. A visit with a dermatologist who knows their stuff can also be a huge help. Sometimes topicals just arent sufficient to knock out problems. ,SkincareAddiction,cooe4cj,4,t5_2tbbg

3163508,0,t1_copqink,I have to say this is a LOT of active ingredients. There is a risk of irritation so be careful.  I would cut out the BP unless you really feel like it is helping.  You are applying clindamyic and taking doxycycline which both work against bacteria so BP feels unnecessary?  Ask your doctor though.I wouldnt worry about CoQ or stem cell stuff. I havent seen many people talk about it in this sub and the rest of your active ingredients should be enough.  I personally feel it is beneficial to take a multivitamin but there isnt proven benefits to the skin.  So take a multivitamin if youd like.Zinc oxide can be calming for the skin. No benefit of titanium dioxide other than it is a physical sunscreen.  It leaves a heavy white cast.Let your skin adapt to your routine for a few weeksmonths before thinking about a peel.Here are some ideas of products which contain multiple activebeneficial ingredients Elta MD Clear SPF  niacinamide  hyaluronic acid. Other Elta MD sunscreens are also good because they have zinc calming ingredient and hyaluronic acid.  Only the Clear version has niacinamide. CeraVe PM niacinamide  hyaluronic acid OR CeraVe SA lotion hyaluronic acid  saliyclic acid OR CeraVe SA cream hyaluronic acid  niacinamide  salicylic acid Paulas Choice Skin Recovery Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum with Retinol vitamin C  other antioxidants  retinol Paulas Choice Skin Recovery Enriched Calming Toner vitamin C  niacinamide  hyaluronic acid Hada Labo UV Whitening Emulsion SPF  SPF  hyaluronic acid  vitamin C Silk Naturals Super Serum Vitamin C  niacinamide  other antioxidantsYou can mix and match some of these products to build a routine you like.

The only way to do this is with a soldering iron which is not something I readily have access to. Within the first five days or so of using it I noticed immense improvement but after a month of everyday use my skin is definitely not where I would optimally like it to be. Some people have said that it does take more than a month for it to really make a difference. Personally I think this is bullshit.

Treatment with BHA can reduce the appearance of pore size by keeping them clean.BHA is very drying and it sounds like its drying your skin out terribly. Most people find it best to introduce a  BHA by using it only a couple of days a week and working up maybe never even using it every day. You definitely need a moisturizer with it.Even oily skin needs a moisturizer doubly so if its oily and dehydrated.

3516756,0,t1_cpsvfgr,Ive never been to this sub before but wanted to come to share my experience with Accutane.First of all I really sympathize with how you feel.  For YEARS I couldnt stand to look at my back in the mirror.  My acne would hurt itch bleed on my shirts.  It would reach my upper arms chest neck... It was extremely uncomfortable and painful and humiliating.  I had longterm girlfriends who literally never saw my completely naked.  I went to countless dermatologists who had me try everything.  But the one thing I was afraid of was Accutane because of fear discomfort maintenance etc.  It was a horrible way to live and I completely understand how you feel. Accutane works.  It really does.  It works within days weeks at most.  You need to get regular blood tests to make sure youre levels are ok.  And if theyre not you stop.  You need to stay out of the sun for like  months.  You need to apply a little chap stick and lotion to keep from drying out.  But thats it.  And what makes it a lot easier is that you start to see progress almost immediately.  And then time flies.  Of course I would try all of the least invasive treatments first and foremost.  But if all else fails which it did for me go with Accutane.  The side effects for me FAR outweighed the pain and discomfort that plagued me for years.   Sorry for the rant.  But I just wanted to share my experience.  ,SkincareAddiction,cpt4wyy,2,t5_2tbbg

Is contest mode your solution? Im not sure I understand how it would work but there needs to be something else than a huge list.   And yes include more than PC and Poketderm Im not sure who else does it because Ive never used it before but this sub needs to be more than just PC and PD.

Itll moisture the area and is only slightly thicker than water. If it really is dryness and not a compulsion you may want to get a second spray bottle and fill it with water. Tell him to spritz the blue bottle water  then the green bottle hyaluronic acid. An added bonus is that it wouldnt be awful if he liked him hands after having this. Another idea is a hand mask. Put a moist on his hand and then some gloves. Set a timer. Make it a part of the routine. Some would have an issue with this so it depends on him.  ,SkincareAddiction,cq0kk4k,29,t5_2tbbg

You should really wait at least  minutes if not an hour afterwards before applying anything. And even then I would stick with things that are soothing NOT actives like BHAAHARetinoids.

3680026,0,t1_cqbqsmi,Itching being everywhere really does make me think its an allergic reaction. Itching in response to allergies is due to histamines which are carried in the blood so it makes sense they would be everywhere. Take an antihistamine such as Benadryl and DONT SCRATCH IT! Seriously scratching it makes it a million times worse. It spreads the allergen around and it also causes a positivefeedback loop where your body produces more histamines in response to the scratching and then you scratch more and then your body produces more histamines. I learned that the hard way when I had a reaction to an allergy shot. I broke out in hives which made me start scratching and panicking and everything got so much worse. Luckily my fiance was driving me home from my allergist when this happened and we happened to be going right by the hospital. They admitted me immediately because my face was swelling up. The doctor told me that scratching my hives was aggravating the reaction. They gave me some benadryl and kept me there for a couple of hours for observation and then sent me on my way with a steroid prescription and an  bill.

And if its strong enough to pull out live hairs it sounds too harsh for the skin. And I think that it made your face soft and it cleared your dry spots because it was ripping off your top layer of skin.

Total nonos seem to be shaving waxing depilatory cream laser. From reading around the internet and the responses I got here I decided to get threading. The salon owner didnt feel comfortable letting me have threading done without having a patch test first. My upper lip area skin wasnt flaking the day I went in to enquire nor the day I had the patch test but the next day it started peeling again. So I waited a couple more days for it to stop and threaded the rest myself.  NB one of the concerns the salon owner had was that even though the threading wouldnt come into contact with my skin the tech showed me how she doesnt press into the skin its still pulling out hairs which might cause issues with a retinoid. NB Ive not been using the adapalene for about a week as Im going to Thailand soon and wanted to mitigate the photosensitivity pharmacist suggested  weeks but I found out on short notice.Even if youre not using the retinoid on that specific area I would be careful as you might be wiping it there without noticing the inner top are of my lids by my brows got very flakey and I realised it was because of this.I would advise you to ask your derm if you have one or go to a salon and ask about threading letting them know about the retinoid. ,SkincareAddiction,cqo56th,3,t5_2tbbg

You can keep it simple with Nivea in the blue tin like uBathm said or buy something from Avene or La RochePosay in a pharmacy. Both brands are quite affordable and filled with good stuff. Id stay clear of skincare from brands as Loreal or Garnier since they mostly fail to practice what they preach.I only used three european sunscreens Nivea leaves an oily residue Biotherm unnecessary expensive Lavozon a Muller product very cheap and my go to when I run out my asian sunscreens.

I suffered from cystic acne throughout high school and college and now I have scars. My left cheek is okay and most of the scars occur on my right cheek see picture. I want to be scarfree so that I can be more confident. Most of the time I tell myself that Im not suffering from acne in order to go through with my life but in reality its a problem.Possible solutions I dont have much money right now but Im not rushing to get rid of the scars. I can come up with some cash k within a year and itd be a good time to get a laser surgery next summer since Ill prolly be taking a vacation during grad school summer break. Ive recently heard about Derma Roller but Im afraid that it might do more damages than good. I want anonymous opinion first before I seek professional help because I was given wrong professional opinions before not regarding acne.A bit about myself My only weakness is acneacne scars. I work very hard in school and always try new activities such as sports and dancing in order to feel valuable. I dont want this to prevent me from pursuing my personal and professional goals. Theres an analogy that goes something like this If you put a notch into a young tree the notch will stay the same size but the tree will outgrow it and becomes a bigger and stronger tree. Then the notch will be insignificant. Thats why I work very hard to accumulate many skillsets in order to make my notches insignificant.Sorry I want to rant in addition to asking question regarding my particular condition.

3879615,0,t1_cqyhx31,Replying here so both you and OP hopefully see it!I have really sensitive skin. I always got these bumps. I fixed it by switching to a safety razor  the single blade puts a lot less pressure on the skin and doesnt ever tug the hair. Its sharper since you replace them every few shaves. Its just generally awesome. I usually also use some aloe on my legs after I shave though its not really necessary for me in most cases. Shoutout to rwickededge and rladyshavers Also a good technique to use even if youre using disposable razors do a first pass thats with the grain of your hair before you do another pass against the grain. Going against the grain initially increases the likelihood of hairs being tugged and creating irritation. ,SkincareAddiction,cqyidas,113,t5_2tbbg

Mixing it with water doesnt make sense to me as oil and water separate and as a result youre still putting undiluted TTO on your delicate facial skin.

3977230,0,t1_cr9lihw,Strong is a relative word. The St. Ives pads are on the sensitive skin end. Theyre  lactic acid and lactic is the gentlest one out of them all. The molecules are larger so you dont get as much irritation dryness etc.. But there are  lactic acid peels that people can use fairly often. Its a better option for people who have very sensitive skin. Most people can handle glycolic acids though!I dont believe it would cause permanent damage unless you tried to start off using it twice a day or something like that. Then its over exfoliation and chemical burns which can leave damage. BUT! You know to take it slow!  You should expect to see redness some dryness and possibly a needlingtingling feeling when you first use it. Thats normal. If your skin burns or anything that you would call very uncomfortable wash your face with your cleanser immediately. Itll help bring your skin pH back up. After the first couple of times you use it you learn whats normal and whats not.

3990585,0,t1_crb0iwr,Definitely. The countries where most skin cancer sunscreen studies come from are the sunniest US and Australia. That sort of sun just doesnt exist in the UK. I got severe vit D deficiency after living in the UK for just a few years. It was affecting my ability to think foggy brain is a side effect and there was speculation it was affecting my fertility as well. When you look up how important vit D is and how many functions it has it seems irresponsible to make a blanket statement that everyone on every part of the planet should wear sunscreen at all times. There are also new studies showing that the recommended levels of vit D have been dangerously low and its been underestimated how important it is to our bodies Google it easy to find. I think there would be incredibly low levels of skin cancer here if Brits understood how to use sunscreen on holiday in hot sunny countries and understood that yes you can damage your skin on those FEW super sunny weeks during the summer in the UK.

4052356,0,t3_36yc6w,. Sunscreen can inhibit vitamin d production yes however its important to consider the fact that many people who dont regularly wear sunscreen also have a vitamin d deficiency. . Ive heard it said that the risk of skin cancer is based more on how many severe sunburns someone got as a child rather than the regularity of sunscreen use as an adult so if youre worried about skin cancer then you could weigh the risks and benefits of going out for  minutes a day and decide if you want to do that. . Theres not much evidence on any particular sunscreen additives being harmful or toxic as far as I know avobenzone can be a skin irritant so you may want to watch out for that. . Lots of people on here like the neutrogena dry touch sunscreens. I personally dont because I have very oily skin but YMMV.  ,SkincareAddiction,cri77oo,1,t5_2tbbg

4067953,0,t1_crjw1at,With everything you need to patch test. I tried jojoba and almond seed oil and LOVED BOTH but it gave me more of what you havetiny little flesh colored bumps that never turn into whitehead zits. These are called closed comedones and I fight the good fight with them nearly daily. The  BHA has gotten rid of mine almost completely but it took about  weeks of daily use to see any results and now I use it about x a week for maintenance with the occasional stubborn bastard popping up though my sign of a product not working for me is these closed comedones after I use it almost always on my forehead and chinthe Great CeraVe Crisis of  comes to mind.Probably the most recommended oil on this sub is plain mineral oil with no additives. Very few people are allergic to it so you should still patch test but I bet itll work just fine for you! I use my oil to remove makeup and use it again to actually cleanse my face of dirt sweat and residue. You can get plain mineral oil from your local Bed Bath and Beyond in the wooden cutting board section. Before I discovered the joy of hemp seed I used the Snow River brand. Really helped with my sebaceous filaments on my nose too!As for makeup Im a bit all over the place. I usually use an indie powder foundation from a brand called Dreamworld Hermetica and that helps cover redness and uneven skin tone a lot without looking unnatural. I also love my NARS Sheer Glow though it tends to make my chin look patchy and flaky because my chin is a pain in the ass and likes to be contradicting. On days where Im just running errands and not doing anything important I use the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circles Concealer  Treatment on top of sunscreen and moisturizer no foundation at all. I even prefer this over my pricy NARS concealer because it covers up red so nicely! NARS still has a place for under eye circles since it has more of a yellow tone in it but the slightly pinktoned Maybelline is phenomenal. I used to use a green tinted primer but saw zero change in the redness. For reference I have a very yellow undertone despite being paleIm in the NC ballpark in MAC and Sheer Glows Gobi is a  perfect match for my jawneck and most of my face. Ive stopped using blush pretty much entirely and just let the redness in the apples of my cheeks peek through. It helps me look rosy and vibrant with less work. If you dont like the feeling of foundation try spot concealing with concealer even if it means spot concealing is half a face then follow up with your translucent powder to set. You could also try a Korean BB creamI have several that I like for nice coverage without feeling heavy but am still on the quest for the perfect match with my undertone. ,SkincareAddiction,crjz430,1,t5_2tbbg

If mineral oil is noncomedogenic because it sits on top of skin and the molecules are too big to absorb into skin does that mean its not a good oil for OCM under the idea of the dissolution theory? If we use OCM in the dissolution sense the oil is supposed to bond with the oil on our skin and in our pores and bring it up and out but I mineral oil is too big to absorb how can it work as an OCM oil?

I have a lot of surgical scars and I wouldnt go outside in my bathing suit for at least six months after I got them and only then I would go but still apply SPF  to them every  minutes and they have faded so nicely into my skin.

Its a quality sunscreen and it has an amazing finish but I personally wouldnt recommend it for skin that gets dry.  I dont even have dry skin but I found it quite drying I am rather prone to dehydration though.  There are other cosmetically elegant Asian sunscreens out there that are appropriate for dry skin though luckily.  Asian sunscreens are amazing so if you can afford them use them.  And a physical or chemphys sunscreen wont affect your makeup any more than a purely chemical one will if youre worried about that.I also second the recommendation to use an SPF  product.  If you cant afford an Asian sunscreen Cetaphil Dermacontrol SPF  is well reviewed as are many Neutrogena facial sunscreens Neutrogena Dry Touch is quite popular and the Pure amp Free Liquid is less well known but looks very promising imo.

Many of the same sites claim jojoba oil or emu oil are very similar to sebum which is also rubbish jojoba is similar to a minor component of sebum the wax esters. People just blindly copy and paste they dont check their facts.Yes a cold pressed unrefined oil will have more antioxidants but it will also have more potentially allergenic proteins. Oils are not created equal with antioxidant content anyway  for example coconut oil is massively lower than extra virgin olive oil. Plus a good antioxidant serum will have way more antioxidants than a plant oil.My skin is classed as hypersensitive with a defective barrier rosacea history of atopic eczema contact dermatitis so I pick my plant oils carefully.

I went to the dermatologist and she gave me like ELI version that the acne was literally spreading under my skin especially because I was picking... The bacteria build up under the blockage of sebum would spread. So first if you are picking stop what comes out of the pimple is nothing compared to the inner implosion under the skin that spreads bacteria to surrounding pores. My derm just told me I had to get the flare under control and prescribed me differin and clindomycin to alternate each night and dalacin for the morning. Now Im completely clear aside from some healing PIH !

4302330,0,t1_csajr8u,The point of the second cleanser isnt to clean more but to simply make sure youre removing all of the oil when you clean it off. Oil is really good at cleaning off dirt and bacteria but it can sometimes still cling to your face when to try to wash it off with water. Then if you accidentally leave a bit of oil on your face that can consequentially be really bad because youre leaving oil  all the dirt it dredged up just sitting around on your skin.Personally I cleanse my face with oil then use a tiny bit of foaming cleanser to smoosh around my face afterwards I can feel really clearly after that that all the oil has been washed off.Oh and as a little extra note I dont know if cleansing then BP is your whole routine but if so I would really recommend adding a moisturiser at the end of your routine because some acne treatments can be really drying for your skin and without using moisturiser the BP could make your skin quite dry and irritated.

You use that all over your face start every other day then move to daily once your skin gets used to it. It breaks up dead skin fades scarring and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and makes your skin tone more even.The Alpha Hydrox spot treatment has an AHA in it but its primary ingredient is hydroquinone which is a skin bleaching agent. You only apply it directly to dark spots not to your whole face. Be careful with that stuff this product only uses  hydroquinone so its probably safe but monitor your skin closely while youre using it.Neither will help much with sebaceous filaments to tackle those you want to use a BHA or salicylic acid.

I really didnt take care of my skin as a teenager which led to mild acne so now I have a big red mark across my cheek that Ive always assumed was an acne scar. So my priorities in skin care are keeping my pores clearmaking them smaller finding a way to soothe and eventually get rid of the giant red mark. My routine up until now was to apply Olay Soak up the sun  SPF moisturizer in the AM and Garnier Moisture Rescue at night. I used a Neutrogena Pore Refining mask once a week. Last night I was bad.

4402570,0,t3_3bfvpa,How does SCA feel about oatmeal for the face?Good! Ive seen a lot of people say it softens their skin up nicely. I think the oats hold in a lot of water so it lets your skin soak up a lot too. I keep powdered green tea and occasionally mix it with Cetaphil as well. Is this okay or a big no?Green tea is a good source of antiaging antioxidants. I dont..know this for a fact but part of me wants to say it should be dissolved in water first. Does it dissolve in the lotion? The only reason I say that is because Ive made a few DIY lotions and the instructions for powdered ingredients usually say to dissolve them in water before adding to a finished lotion. I understand massaging and patting the skin is good for circulation and whatnot. Would vibrating the skin have similar or better results? For example if I bought a mini back massager and ran it across my face in the AMPM. Not sure about the vibrator never read any reviews for one on here but you could do a subreddit search. I can see how an increase in circulation might be beneficial for spreading around nutrients but havent read any science behind it myself. I have been advised to make my own with Vitamin C crystals. I also have a container of vitamin C tablets and would like to know if I crushed them and made a mask would this be beneficial or not.I make my own Vit C when I run out of money for a premade. The last concoction I made was on...June th. It noticed it turning yellow the day before yesterday. Lasts pretty good I think. Im not sure whether or not the pills would work simply because Lascorbic acid is kind of hard to dissolve in water even when I buy the finest grains of it I can find online. You could always try though! Heating the water is a good idea. It still may need to sit for a few hours before it dissolves fully  mine always does. Microneedling...ugh. Ive seen the keloids people get from those. So that and the fact that there are other ways of building collagen vit cretinoids makes me think why do it at all. For anti aging the holy trinity is a retinoid vitamin c niacinamide  a high PPD sunscreeeen. I dont know if its too early. I wish I had started earlier so Id say go for it. They will all improve your complexion and help to fade scarring. Hmmm I dont know of anything that would help with the eyebrow scar ,SkincareAddiction,cslwkk1,2,t5_2tbbg

4463636,0,t3_3c7419,I have dyshydrotic eczema those hands spots you have and my husband has a milder form but the same. I have had severe break outs of this on hands from contact with chlorine and gotten some terrible medical advice over the years  but finally some good advice.Bottom line dry skin and heat make it worse. Any drying chemicals also make it worse. It is an allergic response. What does that mean for youme?Rx steroid cream or ointment will fix it right up faster than anything else. It will stop the allergic response and inflammation. You should not use it long term as it will thin your skin. Yours is bad enough I would recommend seeing a drdermatologist and telling them this info. Dyshydrotic eczema is frequently misdiagnosed. Dry skin makes it worse. That means every time you wash use a mild unscented lotion. Heavy creams help the most. Neutrogena norweigan hand cream eucerin intensive repair hand cream. Anything that leaves a barrier on skin is more helpful. Do not over wash your hands. Heat makes it worse  dont wear latex gloves etc for long periods. Keep hands cool with good air flow. Dont cover the sores. Latex gloves CAN help you wash your hands less when worn for short periods only. Dont pick. Opens you up to infection and more irritation. cotton gloves help keep moisturizer and steroid cream on. I cut the finger tips off of my gloves so I can do more things with them on. ,SkincareAddiction,cstbilh,1,t5_2tbbg

Its much much better than it was before when I was not treating my acne right or at all but I still want to get as close to  clear of course. My routine  AM  Cerave Hydrating Cleanser  Acne.org .

Retinol A is also something Ive heard of. Surely there are other more powerful or potent OTC and Prescription meds and products that are popular and beneficial for acne. One thing I refuse to even consider is Accutane though. Any help or feedback? What should I look into or change with my routine? I still get a few new incidents of active acne a week and it seems like it will not reduce thats about as far as Ive gotten for months since Ive started this all a couple years ago and fell off the track about half a year ago. And also FWIW it seems to come in a cycle or suddenly Ill get a horrible breakout and it can be as sudden as overnight.

Your skin should feel clean but not dry or tight after cleansing. After cleansing use a moisturizer. If your skin is on the oily side on its own not because of your workplace use a cleanser in the am as well. If its on the dry side you can just wash with water in the morning. After that use a moisturizer again. Its highly recommended to follow that up with sunscreen or use an SPF moisturizer.

4540948,0,t1_ct2sinl,It looks like a lot of the bars are poured into clamshells and then popped out which means theres really no artisan value to the soap. Each bar looked exactly the same which screams production to me. I watched a video on their channel on how they make the stuff and its pretty much them adding their own colorfruit to an already existing soap base. To me thats not handmade soap. Thats highefficiency production which isnt necessarily ethically wrong but its a whole lot different than making soap from scratch. If the factory workers at Dove or Irish Spring measured out their own ingredients by hand would you consider it handmade?Think of it like this Lets say someone is selling you handmadehomemade pies and they sell it for a PREMIUM price because of the handmadeness. You finally watch them make it and basically it turns out theyre scooping fruit and sugar into a preexisting crust and heating it. It takes no artisan skill to do that.Im a soapmaker. I buy my ingredients in their pure forms. I have a lye supplier oil supplier fragrance supplier and color supplier. What I dont have is a soap flake supplier. I mix lye with a liquid to create a caustic solution and mix it into a batch of raw oils. I cut the bars by hand and package them myself. Thats handmade to me.

4642224,0,t3_3eird0,I choose products based on ingredients and how that matches with my skin type not simply on recommendations. Despite having hypersensitive skin rosacea history of eczema dermatitis most products  have been fine and my skin improved a lot last year and early this year.Currently struggling with sunscreen but that is more my medical issues than the product. I sweat way too much and cant keep the stuff on my face so much of the hyperpigmentation sun damage is back. If done right OCM should work for most people since there are many possible oils and variations on technique. Many who have problems have selected comedogenic oils or ones with fragrance dont seem to adequately be removing the oil or irritating their skin whilst removing it. I often recommend adding an emulsifier to their oil so it rinses clean with water polysorbate cromollient.Paulas Choice offer samples so you dont have a lot to lose trying their products.

4657001,0,t3_3eqxij,I think the reason why people prefer natural products is because they dont understand the chemistry behind synthetic ones. That being said the latter undergo more testing and are often designed to work in very specific ways which is really cool. The problem with most natural brands imo is that their products are much more likely from what Ive seen to include irritating fragrant plant oils like lavender and citrus oils. Other than that there is no thing wrong with a wellformulated natural product. There are many excellent natrual ingredients to look out for like green tea extract and licorice root extract. As for your skin adjusting to your routine it is certainly possible. For me I used to use . benzol peroxide because  was too much. Now believe I built a tolerance because I can use  without any issues. I would assume retinol and vitamin c work the same way where you can build up to higher strengths. However this doesnt mean the lower strength is no longer effective. It will still continue to work as intended but you can up your dosage if you want because your skin is prepped. I think it is important to adjust your skincare to your skins needs. My routine is very dynamic and changes throughout the year. For example in the summer I dont use a nighttime moisturizer because I am oily and done really need one so I use a serum instead. ,SkincareAddiction,cthknaa,6,t5_2tbbg

4687925,0,t1_ctlfdyn,Be careful with AB products tend to be loaded with fragrance drying alcohol and or glycols propylene butylene. At least some of the glycols are penetration enhancers and skin barrier disruptors generally fine for healthy skin but caution needed where the skin barrier is not functioning well. Potentially useful fragrance free brands include Benton Mizon Tosowoongsome Innisfree products.Propolis is a known allergen and one study  suggests rosaceans are at increased risk. Also remember that snail mucin and fermented extracts are not one compound but numerous ones. Patch test carefully with all these ingredients.IDK what the point of a miniscule amount of honey in a cosmetic product is. For reference  raw honey  can be used in SD presumably for the peroxide it releases. Honey in a product will have the enzymes denatured so it is no longer able to release peroxide and becomes nothing more than a humectant AFAIK.Not sure what you mean by actives in this context AB have a strange way of using the term. Many anti inflammatory non irritating active ingredients are fine for rosaceans for example niacinamide licorice extract green tea.Acid exfoliation is not recommended by the experts and I have reservations about AHAs anyway being photosensitising type  is linked to sun damage all subtypes can have a flare triggered by UV light sun protection is central to self care.Depends which form percentage pH formulation of vitamin C you mean. OST is badly formulated loaded with drying alcohol high percentage low pH so irritating unstable so can become more acidic over time. There was one small study on  Lascorbic acid at pH  see links. Other non acid forms of vitamin C may also be useful due to the antioxidant and UV protection repairing properties.Topical vitamin C preparation reduces erythema of rosacea   Press Release CellexC Skin Firming Cream helps reduce rosacea symptoms Personally I am playing with enzyme exfoliation Skin Actives Pumpkin Peel and a  Lascorbic acid CE ferulic so photoprotective serum at pH . which is only just low enough for penetration. Have slightly overexfoliated with this combo a couple of times and had visible irritation stinging severe blotchiness from subsequent products so am still trying to find the right balance.

4729063,0,t3_3fp3m4,The first image is November  ish. The after was this morning before work.     ampnbspMy skincare journey took place over a long year although if you suffer with acne you know that feels much longer. I grew up very rarely getting blemishes. Basically just splashed some water on my face rinsed it off in the shower etc. No products whatsoever and it was clear as could be. Then a little after I turned  in May  my skin flipped the fuck out. I graduated college moved to a new city started my first real job and had a death in the family all within two months. Im thinking between that and my change in environment from moving to NYC my skin didnt know what to do so it totally rebelled and turned into a scary mess. I had no idea how to handle it. I didnt want to make eye contact with strangers I didnt wear my hair up in a ponytail in fears of people being disgusted at my skin and I basically lost a lot of confidence. It was hard because I had just moved to a new city and I was meeting tons of people for the first time in a state I wasnt comfortable in. I would visit rskincareaddiction and see peoples transformations but it started to feel hopeless that I would ever get clear skin back when nothing was working for me.  I tried many MANY different products trying to figure out how to fix my skin myself. Im super stubborn and figured I could do it alone through trial and error. That only made it worse. I finally was prescribed Aczone in December . That cleared up a lot of the angry cystic spots but didnt do anything to all the little bumps on my cheeks which I would later find out were closed comedones. In June  I finally had enough of trying to get rid of the little bumps myself and went to a dermatologist who told me to get a retinol cream. I used that for about a month and here we are today! No more bumps and no more cystic acne! I have some redness leftover that Im working to fade but my skin is WORLDS different than it was a year ago. My confidence is back Im wearing my hair up and my boyfriend has finally seen my real skin we met near the height of my acne Im thankful he stuck through it with me!. Heres my current routine although Ive found the moisturizers and cleansers never really made a huge difference it was alllll about the Aczone and retinolAM Splash water Algenist Complete Eye Renewal Balm Aczone on cheeks Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion Ive tried a bunch of Clinique moisturizers day and night creams and Ive had good results with them allPM Water Cleanse with First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Deep Cleanser with Red Clay Algenist Complete Eye Renewal Balm Moisturize currently using Algenist Overnight Restorative Cream SkinCeuticals Retinol .

4754050,0,t1_cttri47,Ah sorry! This isnt my field of expertise the initiation of acne is still really unclear. P. acnes can attract neutrophils and other components of the immune system which increase inflammation however some lesions are found to be sterile. This means that for some reason inflammation does occur without invasion of bacteria but I dont think we know why yet. I think theres also some evidence that androgens binding to receptors on the sebaceous gland can all cause cytokine release.Im actually taking some immunology courses in the fall so I can better understand this  I find it really interesting but its not super applicable to my work as I dont work in pharmaceutical development. ,SkincareAddiction,cttskke,5,t5_2tbbg

4766978,0,t3_3fuons,My situation is very similar  history of depression on my mothers side and I was very concerned as well. Additionally I went through an episode of severe depression as diagnosed by therapist about a year before my accutane treatment and some less severe episodes in the past. I expressed my concerns to my dermatologist when he recommended it Ive refused it before and his response was that none of his patients has reported a worsening of depressive symptoms to him and he referred to the same story of the son that someone has already mentioned in the comments. I decided to take it and I was absolutely fine also in regards of other known side effects. My dosage was mg for kg body weight and a diagnosis of acne conglobata. It took about  months for me to see any improvements though. It seems as mg is a relatively small dose? I see people on much more around here.But thats my experience and I was glad I took time to become comfortable with the idea of taking it. To be honest the potential for depression the possibility of liver damage and the monthly pregnancy tests did scare my quite a bit. Eventually I was so fed up with my skin I wanted to risk accutene and luckily was rewarded. Id say definitely express your concerns and take all the time you need to think about it. You can still get a prescription in a few weeksmonths when youre sure you want to give it a try. It took me over  years to make up my mind  You might want to look up nocebo effect if you arent familiar with it already.,SkincareAddiction,ctvf6eu,1,t5_2tbbg

Now cosDNA is not the endall in what clogs pores. Like I said there is no official scale for pore clogging. But if you are acne prone if something registers over a  on cosDNA you might as well avoid it just in case. A facefull of that lotion will probably break you out.If you compare it to Jergens Ultra Long Name it has nothing over a . It might still break you out. No way of knowing but its a safer bet. I can tell you that since its a body lotion and it has petrolatum in it its probably not going to feel nice on your face and it might not sink in like youre used to with a lotion mean for face application.

4912681,0,t1_cudoou2,I am sorry but I cannot let Cliniques Acne Solutions be recommended here without saying something in good conscious. The face wash and toner mentions that it has salicylic acid in its formulas but fails to help acne at all. Salicylic acid in a cleanser wont do anything since it will just be washed off. There are a couple of irritating ingredients in the cleanser that may even worsen any skin conditions. Their products are also not properly pH balanced. Which disallows the salycilic acid in their toner to be an effective exfoliant. The toner is also a strong astrigent containing a lot of alcohol in it. This stuff will irritate the hell out of your skin and will likely make it worse.This is my opinion of Cliniques acne line. I have personally used it as my first skincare regimen and I would never recommend it.I DO recommend using gentle and pH balanced products. OP you havent mentioned your routine or skintype. But I would recommend washing your face with CeraVe or Cetaphil cleansers. Theyre gentle and wont dry out your skin. I would allow your skin to repair its natural moisture barrier before adding any exfoliants. And please start using sunscreen soon! Once you can start regularly using sunscreen you can jump into exfoliants and you will likely see improvements from there. I also highly recommend visiting a dermatologist. You have so many options ahead of you! Good luck.,SkincareAddiction,cuds35o,30,t5_2tbbg

4950342,0,t1_cuiioih,I am trying to give you suggestions hence requesting additional information so we can hopefully suggest suitable cosmetic products. Plenty of the regulars do have a lot of knowledge on ingredients lists of products.Many products marketed as oilfree contain occlusives such as depositing silicones eg. dimethicone dimethiconol cyclomethicone or caprylic capric triglycerides fractionated coconut oil. Can you tolerate any of those? How is your skin with waxes such as refined beeswax candellila jojoba oil cetyl esters medical grade lanolin?AFAIK for folliculitis prescription products are usually necessary also we dont want to suggest actives that duplicate or fight with your current medication nor go against your doctors advice. Hence asking about the diagnosis and prescription.Do bear in mind different active substances have different availability in different countries benzoyl peroxide is virtually prescription only in the UK and hydroquinone has been banned in the EU for example. So what is medical advice to me may not seem to be medical advice to you.,SkincareAddiction,cuij3bk,3,t5_2tbbg

I just scooped up all the powder and put it back into it container. Still use it to this day. If the box was dirty I probably wouldnt have used it considering the stuff is for fish tanks.Also a single can of Wellness cat food was damaged in a pack of . Smelled like dead mice.

Or something.Anyway youll want to stop using your aha for a few months and let your skin adjust to the tretinoin.  Its also vital that you use sunscreen while using a retinoid!  Tretinoin makes your skin more photosensitive so its quite counterproductive to use it for anti aging without using spf.More helpful advice on retinoid use here,SkincareAddiction,cuta4x0,3,t5_2tbbg

5208219,0,t3_3mcb5w,Hi there! It seems like you may be looking for some information on DermarollingDermastamping. Dermarolling can improve the appearance of atrophic scarring when done correctly. However there are several risks and Id like to warn you about them  You should not be doing this every day. When done inoffice treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart. Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color It hurts. You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best. The needles can become bent over time or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.Because of these risks ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home.

5219687,0,t1_cveyjev,You can most definitely put on two layers of acids but most people find that too irritating for their skin. Also its a waste of expensive product.  Toners are much cheaper. Some people use pH toners to bring down their skins pH in order for their exfoliants to be effective even longer.  These toners usually have some sort of bha or aha in them but at concentrations that are too low to be effective.  Then there are toners like Witch hazel which can bring your pH down but may be irritating to some people because of trace amounts of alcohol in them. ,SkincareAddiction,cvf5xd2,2,t5_2tbbg

Having Oil of Olay shortened to Olay was a decent idea but the word olay is still weird to me. It sounds like the Spanish expression or an idiots pronunciation of oil. I still occasionally hear Master Charge instead of Mastercard which sounds very old school to me.

5264270,0,t1_cvk936g,The routine they suggested seems a little complicated imo. Im not convinced the toner is necessary.I know you really want to incorporate all the things at once but I would strongly advise against it. Since dryness is a huge concern start with the nighttime moisturizer. I would add the Clearing Treatment last since BP can cause dryness. If the BHA hasnt given you any problems switching to the lotion might help with the dryness as well.Personally I try a new product for at least a week but it really depends on how well you know your skin.,SkincareAddiction,cvkkhs5,1,t5_2tbbg

5284675,0,t3_3ndqqa, yes sunscreen is necessary.  Trentoin makes your skin more susceptible to sun damage.  It doesnt matter when you apply it because absorption is not the issue here.  It is usually suggested to use at night only because it trentoin can break down with UV exposure.  Not using sunscreen probably wont make it less effective for acne but PIH treatment wont work without sunscreen use.  In addition the antibiotics may make you sensitive to the sun.  I am not  sure about the saltwater.  Unless it has crystals of salt it wont exfoliate.  I think it would be better to use this after trentoin then before.  Regular trentoin is only active for about a short time on skin.  Skin is supposed to be dry to minimize too much absorption.  You are probably better off asking your derm.  Also in general physical exfoliation is not suggested to use daily on SCA see sidebar.  ,SkincareAddiction,cvn6g3e,2,t5_2tbbg

I enjoy debate and I dont mind when people tell me I am wrong because I see it as an chance for me to learn or correct some misinformation I may be spreading unknowingly.  I do get exasperated as a scientist when pseudoscience is proclaimed as fact so I may have come across more opinionated than usual.  We all have opinions but I learned from this sub that things like mineral oil alcohol or parabens are not evil or bad ingredients and I wanted to state the alternative opinionshypothesis with a definitive tone.,SkincareAddiction,cvqcv3d,1,t5_2tbbg

5321283,0,t1_cvrugjv,Thanks.I dont have a disorder but I read on here that parabens are not dangerous but then i see a bunch of stuff on google about parabens and bht being harmful.Before going off of chemicals my full routine wasMorning Clean amp Clear Advantage Daily Soothing Acne Scrub Oil Free Aloe amp AvocadoCerave MoisturizerPMClean amp Clear Advantage Daily Soothing Acne Scrub Oil Free Aloe amp AvocadoClean amp Clear Continuous Control Benzoyl Peroxide My face was  clear but my skin was very oily and my sister started making fun of me for having oily skin and I had a lot of dark PIH on my face. I then started reading about how chemicals are bad for your face on acne.org and eventually started reading about the caveman regimen. So I tried that for a week and my skin got worse. Then i started putting ACV on my face for about a week but did not help.Then I started using hemp oil only in the morning and thats it. A couple weeks ago I tried to use cerave moisturizer again and it gave me whiteheads the same day and Sca members said moisturizers cant make you purge. So I continued using hemp oil but my forehead continues to break out and my skin is very bumpy. I switched to safflower oil breakouts diminished a little but still very visible. I also have to take swimming in school so after that I use sebamed clear face gel which seems to be working fine. However I am still frustrated with my skin because in the morning after OCM my skin is whitehead free but when I come back from school there are so many whiteheads and it looks embarrassing. I just dont know what works and what doesnt anymore.,SkincareAddiction,cvrutzc,-2,t5_2tbbg

5356009,1,t3_3och3j,Imo we should also ban the users giving out just piss poor tips as if theyre golden. Maybe not permaban but Id say at least a  month ban so they have more time reflecting on what they did wrong and do some actual research  browsing before spewing shit from their mouths.Exaggerated mb example You wont believe this because of the circlejerk in this sub but just put tons of lemon juice all over ur face. rub salt into it wait a few minutes the burning sensation is good. It means your pores are OPENING. and then finish it off with some nice and healthy NATURAL rubbing alcohol. Then just pick your pits away and youll have no blackheads within the week. Works for me.

5367169,0,t3_3oj3ti,Spirolacone is very cheap.  You may need a higher dose.  I just say this because my GP started me at  mg but my more experienced endocrinologist raised me to  mg because  mg is not usually enough.  I already knew  mg was below the recommended starting dose.  My GP is less experienced and was being cautious.  Target and other stores have an RX club for  generics.  Some stores charge a minimum cost of . for all meds filled that are cash.  Spirolactone is on the list of disounted generics.  Just get your doctor to give you as many refills or a  day supply with refills.  Often one fill is less expensive then getting refills and the pharmacy can break up the refills if needed.  Spiro may cause birth defects also so be cautious.  Hopefully you can reinstate your insurance coverage soon.  ,SkincareAddiction,cvxpsxo,3,t5_2tbbg

5372015,0,t3_3okoli,So if you were prone to breaking out from products the Palmers that you mentioned probably would have done it. Definitely switch to a different moisturizer than your current one which is meant for very oily skin.CeraVe is mentioned a lot around here for the Ceramides. It works for some people but leaves my skin uncomfortable dry and rough. You can get sample sizes from the travel section of the drugstore. Gold Bond Ultimate Healing with Aloe and Aveeno Daily lotion also come in sample sizes Gold Bond Ultimate Healing is my current goto although I think theyve got others that might be better. But they dont come in sample sizes. They have enough for maybe a month on your face and are definitely all worth trying to see what works for you. Another thing to try is ordering samples from Paulas Choice theyve got a lot of well formulated moisturizers. You should also switch to a gentle cleanser a nice nonfoaming one would be good. Theres CeraVe hydrating Yes To Cucumbers milk cleanser and Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser. You could also try a micellar water Simple has one. I use the Nuance Salma Hayek Chamomile Cream cleanser which is very gentle but rather strongly frangranced it smells amazing thoughI actually am prone to product related breakouts and what I do is introduce a new product use it for a week without introducing any other new products and then see if it works for me. Many stores such as CVS allow returns of products that didnt work out for you. ,SkincareAddiction,cvyc33b,1,t5_2tbbg
5375474,0,t1_cvxv26d,For the sebaceous filaments maybe try oil massage.  So apply oil to your dry face massage for about a minute then use a washcloth or cotton round and water to wash it off this step might be optional? then use your cleanser as usual.  You could experiment with doing it morning andor evening.  I personally believe that BHA  oil massage is the key to keeping SFs under control.Salicylic acid did nothing to control my acne either.  There are many causes of acne which is why there are so many different treatments. I also tried tretinoin for many months and kept breaking out.  Eventually I switched to pocketderm tretinoin clindamycin azelaic acid and spironolactone.  I think the spiro has done more for me than any other skincare product.  It totally keeps my skin under control.  So if you find that its not doing anything for you after a few weeks try something else.,SkincareAddiction,cvys099,1,t5_2tbbg

My only complaints are that if I take it every day I get my period twice as often I have had a very slight decrease in libido and I get pretty intense vaginal dryness and overall dryness... All skin armpits especially. Kinda weird but makes sense if youre systemically decreasing a production in oil! so I just take it starting the middle of my cycle until the last day of my period which is the most major pimple time for me. Im not pimplefree maybe  very small pimples during my PMS but Im damn near close and Im so happy I was able to find a solution that ensured birth control and control of my horrible acne.

5399928,0,t1_cw1l61n,Check out some of the posts in this sub about other peoples routines by just searching the word routine. Some people have flawless or at least very good skin without really having a routine or doing stuff inconsistently with a few products here and there. Thats probably a very small minority though and your perception as a guy might be offset by the fact that so many women and now men especially celebrities in Asia as well as the west use make up to cover up uneven or blemished skin. If youre not seeing any improvement its because youre not actually doing anything to improve your skin. Not to be mean but youre really halfassing your skincare by being lazy or being afraid of cold water. For the cold water thing youre in Malaysia. I dont know how similar the weather is to Thailand Ive stayed a few times there in the rainy season but the water was never that cold like it is in America in the winter. And if its your familyfriends that are giving you that kind of advice really take it with a grain of salt until you can find some sort of well documented tests and confirmations from other people like on the internet or unless you can do some controlled testing to determine if yourself. That goes for any sort of health advice that you get from a friend or family member really.As for coming up with a routine youre probably better off asking rAsianBeauty because most of us here are based in the US or Europe and have access to different products at different prices than folks in Asia. You want to be clear about what products youre currently using brand name and product name so that you can find out if what youre using is worth keeping. At the very least you want a gentle cleanser acne treatment and moisturizer. Its kind of a waste of money to be adding in other things to fade redness if your acne isnt under control and it can be kind of risky if you dont have a good idea of whats good or bad for your face anyway because something might cause your skin to get worse.If youre feeling demotivated well you havent really tried enough to be giving up now. Theres still a lot for you to try and a lot for you to learn before you should even begin trying things out. Seriously read the sidebar here and maybe even in rAsianBeauty. The articles on acne.org are also pretty informative and a bit more organized than Reddit. Either way education is the first and unavoidable step in finally getting clear skin and Im definitely sure that you can have clear skin too if you take it seriously.,SkincareAddiction,cw1wfdf,1,t5_2tbbg

5605316,0,t3_3rv0ed,Comedogenic ratings are mostly rubbish based on really old experiments in rabbit ear massively more sensitive than human skin or just guesswork. Many of the studies have since been debunked including by one of the authors themselves the late great dermatologist Albert KligmanI use and recommend medical grade lanolin for various skin complaints since it supplies lipids that the skin barrier can actually use cholesterol cholesterol esters. Other useful non plant lipid sources are beeswax very long chain saturated fatty acids and egg lecithin precursors to ceramides. All three are best as ingredients rather than straight up.I wouldnt use any old animal fat or plant oil without researching the composition some are loaded with oleic acid which is detrimental to the skin barrier for example. Much of what is claimed about emu oil can be tracked back to the American Emu Association ie. it is biased.You might cross post to rAsianbeauty since donkey oil and horse oil are a thing.True blackheads and closed comedones are acne you dont have to have inflamed pimples.

The are more of a milky formula so no white case or greasy residue and often have ingredients that actively help brighten skin. Sunscreens constantly break me out but korean ones have been my holy grail and have helped dramatically with my acne scars. I highly recommened coming to talk over at rAsianBeauty . My favourite sunscreen is Mentholatum Sunplay Skin Aqua Sunscreen SPF  PA UV Moisture Milk . The bottles are quiet small for the cost however I have found using it specifically on my face has lasted me near  months.

5690339,0,t3_3t0fx9,Hey ueood im can relate to your struggle.  Here are a few pieces of advice while you wait to see the GP. Ice for  minutes in the morning and ice again for  minutes in the evening.  If your skin can handle the cold you can go longer but dont go over an hour  you dont want to damage the skin.   Anything with salicylic acid will work great  its basically an antiinflammatory.  And your cyst is inflamed.  If you cannot find salicylic acid you can crush a pill of ibuprofen or Aspirin add some water to make it a thick paste and put it on the cyst.  Wash off after an hour or so. Lastly dont use products that will dry out the skin eg. benzoyl peroxide.  A pore was clogged and is causing the cyst.  You need to get that pore to open up.  The best ways are to keep your skin moist and try to get the cyst to come to a head.  So when not icing use a warm damp cloth and let it sit on your face.  Sometimes I put Jojoba oil on top of the cyst as a moisturizer.  Jojoba oil is the closest oil similar to human sebum.  And that might help to dissolve the clogged pore causing the cyst.I really hope these help.  Its not going to make it better by tomorrow.  But over the next few days youll see a decrease.,SkincareAddiction,cx2fx3t,3,t5_2tbbg

Just tell me the risks and let me make my own damned decisions. Requiring two forms of birth control? Sure. Monthly pregnancy tests? If my doctor thinks that it a appropriate just to be sure alright. But to have the federal government step in with a whole institution that steps between me and my doctor and my pharmacist and prevents me from getting my prescription filled at all because I was on vacation and couldnt meet the exact deadline they gave me? Or if its Christmas and my doctors office is closed the entire week of my window?Its fucking ridiculous. Not to mention womens reproductive cycles vary wildly.  days with no budging for every single woman doesnt even serve any real purpose.Their intent is bullshit let me do what I want.

5806932,0,t1_cxgi4hh,Always follow their instructions on a peel. That said the reason you dont want to normally use BS on your skin is because it is so basic. This is also what makes it perfect for neutralizing something like a peel which is an unusually strong acid you wouldnt normally use. Anecdotally I do this after my peels and have had no problems but note that it might fee warm when you neutralize it and it might bubble a little. You know the science experiment with a volcano of baking soda and vinegar? I also tend to put on my witch hazel toner afterward to soothe my skin and make sure it goes back to normal. ,SkincareAddiction,cxgwl65,1,t5_2tbbg

5821805,0,t3_3uy80k,Well acne around the chinjawline area is usually hormonal so theres a chance that they keep coming back because you stopped using birth control. Do they usually come to a whitehead? If they do I would suggest putting on a hydrocolloid bandage on them to completely drain out the pus. Even if it doesnt come to a head you can still put it on just to reduce the size. Other than that you can also try placing ice on them everyday. If need be perhaps you can go to a dermatologist and get a cortisone shot.,SkincareAddiction,cxiri61,1,t5_2tbbg
5822246,0,t3_3uwbtz,Yeah youre gonna lose that nail. Sorry. The good news is that  it will heal and youll grow a new one! Be glad its on your toe I did this to my pointer finger and had to paint my nails black and navy blue for  months! LOL. It probably doesnt hurt anymore because its stopped actively bleeding. Its probably just dried blood under there. Burning a hole in the nail only helps when its pretty quick after the injury you could try it but unless the pressure is really bothering you Id skip it. If youre not careful you could end up damaging the nail bed itself.The nail actually forms from the bottom up not horizontally from the cuticle like some might think. The nail will probably start lifting around the edges and as it grows out it will lift more until it eventually falls off. Mine eventually lifted JUST enough for me to insert a clean flat toothpick under the nail and I was able to scrape some of the dried blood out so it didnt appear so dark. It finally fell off and the new nail was already mostly formed underneath looked just like a shiny hard piece of skin. I was bad and helped it fall off completely it was hanging on my just a tiny piece so I used manicure scissors to cut it off. Bad bad. The new nail is mostly normal I have a small white streak that runs through it and the free edge is like x as thick in just this teeny middle third of the nail. Bizarre.

5849507,0,t3_3uwhmd,I need routine troubleshooting. I have combination acneprone skin with seborrheic dermatitis mainly on the sides of my nose around mouth and eyebrows. Moderate acne on face neck chest and back. Started Pocketderm in August with the standard  azelaic clindamycin niacinamide formula and then switched to  azelaic clindamycin. tretinoin in mid September. Original formula helped clear up face and neck acne fairly well with occasional breakouts but blackheads texture and PIH were still issues so I asked for tretinoin. I have been using this routine for nearly two months or soAM Noble Zinc Soap on body and face for a couple minutes. Shave with electric razor. Apply alum block. Rinse and dry off. Apply a few drops of Nufountain Cferulic and wait  minutes. Apply Dr Lins Hydrating Gel. Apply  Miconazole cream to mouth and eyebrow area. Apply Elta MD Clear sunscreen.PM MWF Wash body and face with Topix  BP Cleanser for a minute or so. Dry off. Apply a few drops of Nufountain Celsignal MAP Hydrating Serum. Apply Dr Lins Gel. Apply a few pumps of Pocketderm to face and neck. Apply vaseline sparingly to face and neck.PM TThSat same as above except wash with Hibiclens for a minute or so. I intend to ratchet this down to once a week as I know it shouldnt be used too often and just replace it with the BP wash or Cerave Foaming based on irritationdryness. Once a week I wash body and face with Nizoral shampoo to help the pyrithione zinc with the body acne folliculitus and Seborrheic dermatitis and to reduce androgen activity. I use a body bufpuf on chest and back as well.My chest and back are much better with some breakouts but not as severe as before. Also drynessirritation on body is not really much of an issue.Face and neck though still havent improved much. Still am getting some large breakouts on cheeks neck and jaw line. I have clogged pores and blackheads on nose and next to nose and occasional whiteheads around mouth area. Tretinoin irritation and flaking were an issue early on but not so much now. The flaking and dryness from the SD is not much of an issue anymore but I am still have redness of mouth chin and sides of nose. Redness is the worst at nasal labial folds. I also get these white plugs of skinoil from the pores at nasal labial folds. Are these sebaceous filaments or something else like irritated skin? They essentially look like white spikes poking out from the blackheadspores. And they will either eventually grow long enough and fall out or I use tweezers to extract them. Are there any red flags in my routine that are setting back my improvement? I know it is still relatively early in my tretinoin progress. Would a konjac sponge be a good addition to the AM routine to remove the PM vaseline and flakes from tretinoin and SD? Would  zinc oxide vaseline ointment help with the mouth area redness? I usually am dry in that area but daily shaving removes flakes. Am I not recognizing irritation because of that? ,SkincareAddiction,cxmedcj,1,t5_2tbbg

I will note that the discoloration only occurs for a few days each month always during the week prior to my period. Edit finally found one source here that mentions anemia and goldrelated dyschromia.

Are you applying and reapplying the full recommended amount at least half a teaspoon for face and neck more for decollete of a broad spectrum sunscreen? How long have you been using the retinol and vitamin C? Have you considered niacinamide?Water alone does not hydrate the skin the body needs a raft of minerals and essential fatty acids to hold onto the water. Alcohol depletes certain micronutrients so you may need more than the minimum  ditto if you are physically active the recommended  steps every day.Consider the size of glass alcohol percentage and therefore the number of units one small wine glass ml is very different than two large glasses ml each. Recommended units of alcohol  are based on small glasses but I only ever stick to that size with sparkling wine on Christmas morning or at weddings!You might research microneedling with the free and comprehensive on the Owndoc website.  That would need a good collagen building routine which you are obviously already working on plus a properly balanced and varied nutrient dense diet for best results.I hated my th having found my first white hairs a few days before. ,SkincareAddiction,cy2jmj4,1,t5_2tbbg

5980635,0,t3_3xcxp5,I just want to add my voice to those saying this isnt nearly as bad as you feel it is. If you are finding you have self esteem issues because of this those are at least as important to treat as KP. Speaking from experience as having had pretty bad suicidal ideation things others might see as small or unimportant can trigger those horrible thoughts. If you find it can be set off by this you would probably benefit from talking about it with a friend or maybe counselling. Trust me from most  peoples perspectives this is practically nothing a small blemish. Many people have plenty of those and dont jump to extreme conclusions of youll pardon the phrasing. Please for your own sake work on improving your selfimage as the image we can all see is perfectly fine.,SkincareAddiction,cy3lck2,6,t5_2tbbg

5983859,0,t3_3wsr17,Hi! I have been lurking for a couple of years but Ive hit a skincare issue that I cant seem to figure out on my own.Issue I get small closedcomedone breakouts along my chin and just under my cheeksabove my jawline. I will also get painful whiteheads under my nose. These both tend to appear simultaneously usually once every  weeks.Skin type I have rosacea on my cheeks. Im not prone to and have never had cystic acne or serious breakouts. My skin is hypersensitive even CeraVe broke me out!. My skin is moderately dry except for my nose which is extremely oily.Current Routine I wash my face in the evenings with Clinique Oil Cleanser and use a baby washcloth to gently exfoliaterinse it off. I use Sweet Almond Oil to moisturize. I will occasionally once every  days rinse my face with warm water in the mornings and I use a small amount of sweet almond oil then too. I wear Clinique BB cream with SPF daily. Ive been using this routine for at least two years.Other info Ive been on the Depo birth control shot for like seven years so I dont have periods. I do notice that my skin flareups are slightly worse just beforejust after my shot but they also happen when Im not due for a shot. They may be hormonal or exacerbated by hormones. Ive been struggling with this for at least a year and Im ready to explore options that may help calm these flareups down a little even if they dont go away completely because of hormones.Location USA.Im considering a heavier moisturizer  probably Clinique since Ive had success with them  and either a spot treatment or a slightly heavier cleanser maybe one of the BHA ones to use just on my trouble areas. Im open to anything but since my skin is so reactive it would have to be something I can test.Thanks! I really appreciate you taking the time to read this and give me suggestions. It means a lot and you all are super helpful and amazing.,SkincareAddiction,cy40k9j,1,t5_2tbbg

5995684,0,t3_3xhjeu,so.. my two cents about birth control. there have really been no substantial studies about any form other than the shot causing weight gain. I know this because Ive heavily researched it before I just asked my doctor to put me on the brand I wanted for xyz reasons that she agreed with.that being said when I first started birth control forever ago I used yasmin and I liked it. it did help with clearing up my skin at least I think it did I also took a  job at a camp so I was eating better protecting my skin with sunscreen more showering and cleaning my body a lot more because I would get dirty more and exercising more. so it could have been a combination of things for sure. ,SkincareAddiction,cy5kck7,1,t5_2tbbg

6010479,0,t3_3xsbki,Hm you could give it a shot if you want but just be extra vigilant about possible side effects. I had terrible cystic acne for months I still have one single fcking cyst that refuses to go away!!!! and my dr put me on minocycline. I think it might be a bit stronger than doxy it has more side effects. I had a terrible reaction to it but had no idea what was going on. I got blood tests an ekg a stress test all because I suddenly became dead tired always on the verge of fainting. It was because of the mino but it took months three doctors and me getting mild serum sickness hives  fever to figure it out. I cant take any tetracycline antibiotics now.  ampnbsp  My derm put me on a topical sulfa antibiotic called Aczone  dapsone gel and it worked quite well. If youre really worried about the side effects Id ask about dapsone it was only like  too because my derm gave me this card that makes the first one  the second  and the third free.,SkincareAddiction,cy7i5w2,1,t5_2tbbg

6022389,0,t3_3xxk8g,What are you hoping to get out of the consultation? I would only go to a derm if I needed something that wasnt available OTC  theyre doctors they have limited time to meet with you and are looking to prescribe medication. Every derm Ive visited has taken one look at my face tossed  prescriptions at me with minimal instruction and kicked me out all within the time span of  minutes. For just a consultation it would be better to see an esthetician imo  since they dont have prescriptions at hand they often have to take a more holistic approach and the good ones will tell you if it is indeed time to see a derm. ,SkincareAddiction,cy923w5,2,t5_2tbbg

6037768,0,t3_3y6sq9,I have similar skin as far as oil production goes. Like someone else suggested wash less. One of the reasons skin produces oil is to keep it moisturized. My suggestion would be to wash once a day. Use a good moisturizer after washing. My personal favorite is the CeraVe tub for normal skin. Drink lots of water. Do this for  weeks and see if theres an improvement. Also buy those oil blotting blue sheets and use as needed throughout the day. Theyre life savers!,SkincareAddiction,cyb2bi7,4,t5_2tbbg

Its a huge pain in the ass but trust me you need to go through the awful stage to see really amazing results at the end I say this as someone who went on several different treatment plans pussied out at the purging stage and finally manned up using Tretinoin and had amazing results after the purge. Horrible scarring from the failed attempts though.I mean if youre truly unhappy with it of course call your doctor! Theres so many treatment plans available that theres truly no shame in wanting to explore your options. They could also recommend supplemental products to help with drynesspimples. I really love Cerave lotion for dry skin it is really moisturising and doesnt react badly with most acne treatments! The SPF  one should also help with sun sensitivity Mind sharing the products youre planning to use? I only ask because a lot of products should not be used together or can reduce the effectiveness of your medication. It could possible do more harm than good.

Much like Crohns disease I would imagine PCOS is one of those things where doctors arent always the source of the best most recent or most helpful information.

6152763,0,t3_3zswgc,Yes stop using them. Cleansers and moisturizers dont have active ingredients that will treat acne therefore dont cause purging. Any increase in acne after adding one of these is a sign of a breakout and it wont get better with use.You need to introduce just ONE product at a time preferably with patchtesting beforehand and at least two weeks in between adding another new product. Just because a product is decent or recommended... doesnt mean itll work for you unfortunately. Skincare is tricky and frustrating that way!  ,SkincareAddiction,cyp075o,2,t5_2tbbg
6154762,0,t3_3zulfr,I used that before! Im not sure about the pH cause I was super young it was the first thing I ever found back in middle school that made any kind of difference in my KP. I didnt like it though because in the shower the lotion washes off my skin turns slimy under the water and when I dry off my skin is back to being bumpy. I always questioned whether it just made a film over my skin.

6190740,0,t3_40cz1z,It looks fine although Im really not fond of CeraVe AM. You wont be getting proper sun protection with it. Its better to use a dedicated moisturizer like CeraVe PM with a dedicated sunscreen.Dont use the Clean amp Clear after the CeraVe Skin Renewing Cream Serum. The serum contains retinol and using the Clean amp Clear Spot Treatment which contains salicylic acid can decrease the efficacy. Clean amp Clear is also pretty harsh.Youre fine using a retinol product as your exfoliation step just keep in mind that they can take several months before you start seeing results.,SkincareAddiction,cytblnh,1,t5_2tbbg
6196961,0,t3_40fe09,OK so first  well go over what is going on then what can be done.     What is going on? Your skin is getting thinner and less elastic. The thickness is caused by loss of collagens and elastins and by decreased moisturizing carbohydrates hyalurons. These are caused in small part by aging and in large part by UV light.    The first most obvious thing is to avoid UV light. Get a good sunscreen  with good UVA coverage. If you buy in the USA you will not be getting a good sunscreen. The foreign sunscreens contain new classes of UVA blocker that are awesome and not supplied in the USA. EBay has sellers. Research that in this forum. So the number one most important thing is no UV light or always use sunscreen.    Number two. Restore collagen. Vitamin C and Retinoids do this. Retinoids will sensitive your skin to sun exposure as well  whereas Vitamin C does not. Lots of info on this forum about both of these.    Number Three Moisturize WELL. Use a moisturizer with niacinamide. Your skin does not retain moisture as well when you age  and this moisture loss makes it thinner. Topical Vitamin E also works well.    Number four. Microinjections of hyaluronic acid. These are done at the doctor. The injections temporarily put the hyaluronic acid back in your skin. They plump up the skin and make it look younger. Over time the hyalurons will be removed and you will need to repeat.     If all you do is use sunscreen and moisturize well you will nearly halt aging progression of your skin. Reversing the clock is insanely difficult but retinoids and microinjections are the most efficient paths but stopping the clock is comparably easy. Stop the clock. ,SkincareAddiction,cyu114e,1,t5_2tbbg

I read a comment on ScA from one redditor saying that it gave them acne when they applied too much so maybe using less would cut down on the oiliness. Alternatively there are always oil blotting sheets that you can use to soak up excess oil once the cream has absorbedsunk in.

6221226,0,t1_cywn81b,I used to use a BHA with tretinoin without issue and I have extremely dry skin. You have to let your skin adjust to the Taz before incorporating the BHA. Use it every other day instead of everyday and see if the irritation subsides if not step down to every rd day. Once you are using the Taz regularly without irritation incorporate the BHA on alternating days. Also make sure that you are waiting enough time after cleansing before applying the Taz! When applied to damp skin it can penetrate too deeply and cause flakiness and irritation. You may also want to apply it after your moisturizer which buffers it and cuts down in irritation.,SkincareAddiction,cywsb7f,1,t5_2tbbg

Ive only tried a handful of  ingredients cetyl alcohol coconut oil algae extract since discovering SCA and got horrible cystic breakouts every time. Now I wont use any produce with an ingredient higher than a  and Im reasonably sure that some of those s caused issues too youve broken my heart olive oil. Basically every bad ingredient turned out to be and some of the less risky ingredients too so Im more likely to trust a claim that something will cause acne than the opposite. Better safe than sorry.I like cosdna because it usually lists what an ingredient died in a formula along with comedogenicity and irritation rankings.

It can be pretty tricky to find the cause of rashes in general though.  We dont always know what potential irritants we are exposed to.  Viruses and bacteria can also cause rashes.  The rule of thumb is that if it is severe or causes any other symptoms like dizziness fever or difficulty breathing or if it gets worse or persists see a doctor. ,SkincareAddiction,cz1ebw6,1,t5_2tbbg

6367839,0,t3_42ui2s,. I notice your routine is quite heavy on occlusives and light on humectants. Humectants draw water into the skin occlusives prevent the water already in your skin from escaping. Without drawing moisture in theres not too much point in preventing moisture escape right? I recommend finding a lighter moisturizer with glycerine glycol hyaluronic acid etc. before your CeraVe.. Are you using steam hot water etc during your OCM? If so stop. Your pores dont open or close depending on temperature and excess heat will just dry you out. OCM without that or if you feel you need it just lay a warm not hot! wet washcloth over your face.. If you rarely get blemishes I would suggest against the Stridex. BHAs are generally used to combat acne. If you want even hydrated skin Id suggest going after an exfoliant of the AHA variety as they are hydrating.. Any redness? Sensitivity? Swelling? As a whole your routine seems quite moisturizing so this could be a mild allergic reaction and the dryness could just be the first symptom.,SkincareAddiction,czdgc3y,7,t5_2tbbg

Right after I recommend trying micellar water I also recommend doing doing a full face wash after the workout. Additionally micellar doesnt stay on your skin the way a normal makeup remover does though some people will need to rinse with water to remove it depending on skin type and products. There is a good scientific explanation here I am offering my personal experience and my gym routine which works for me. One micellar gave me blackheads another works beautifully on my skin. I know some people dont like micellar water some do. Just a few days ago there was a thread of people talking about how great it is for their skin especially in winter and in places with hard water.

I guess you could look into maybe an AHA exfoliant to help with skin texture and tone however if you believe your skin is dehydrated i.e. flaky and feels tight though looks oily easily irritated acneclog prone you way want to avoid exfoliants and up you hydrationmoisturizer game you didnt post your skin care routine so Im not sure as to what you are currently doing.

Redken does a dandruff shampoo which I highly recommend.  Nioxin is another brand that could be beneficial also. Also when using medicated shampoos it is important to rotate their use with a regular gentle shampoo.  Its a good idea to give your loved onesworkmatespeople you spend a lot of time with permission to tell you to stop scratching if they notice you doing it.

6550787,0,t3_44twaq,Thanks Hippo for the suggestions. Yes I use CeraveAM with SPF during the warm months or if I am going to be outside in the sun. Is the Dr.Lins something I can use in the morning? I do really like the CeraVe PM but it seems to make my face very shiny during the day and I have read it has some things that could be acne causing per COSDNA. It is odd though I notice my skin feeling very dry many days but at the same time when I use an oilblotter sheet half way through the day it almost always gets fully used with oil from my face.

Yes some of the contents of the infection may be absorbed but a pimple that comes to can be lanced and drained with a bandage.  Usually a cream isnt doing too much.

6605956,0,t3_464fsm,I am not crazy about oil cleansing without an emulsifier although some normaldry skin types especially do have some success.   Have you oil cleansed before?  Make sure to patch test.  Oil cleansing can breakout some skin types especially pure oil cleansing without an emulsifier or a double cleanser.  If you oil cleanse definitely dont change anything on your routine for a few weeks so if you do break out you know the cause.  I dont like jojoba oil for oil cleansing alone because it tends to absorb too well although some jojoba oils are covertly diluted with cheaper oils like olive or even mineral oil.   I tried oil cleansing with mineral and it was very bad for my skin.  Now I love oil cleansing and I use some Korean oil cleansers or sherbets followed by micellular water andor a low ph cleanser.  I oil cleanse on dry skin then follow by rubbing with water to emulsify.,SkincareAddiction,d02m08k,3,t5_2tbbg

6607666,0,t1_d02rygh,Youre welcome. It sucks the Alba one doesnt work for your face  I would recommend the Shiseido sunscreen I use on my neck but its definitely too shiny for my face it blends in better on my neck for whatever reason so luckily I can at least use up what I bought and not waste it. So yeah... You could also try a select few La Roche Posay sunscreens. They have some that is  oz for  on Amazon and while that price seems scary if you do the math its only about  more expensive per oz than the Biore one I mentioned. I heard those were supposed to be really good. But yeah. I dont use the American ones because they dont rate their UVA protection like the UK and Asian sunscreens do and therefore its probably low. And the shipping costs make the UK ones too expensive for me  But if that isnt a huge concern to you you could try it. I did use this sunscreen for a while and I liked it a lot but it does have barely too much of a sheen. Less than the Shiseido one I was talking about though. The UVA protection is also pretty abysmal too so thats why I switched. But yeah. Just throwing it out there.,SkincareAddiction,d02se6x,1,t5_2tbbg

6650497,0,t3_46qw6l,Im ultra sensitive to fatty alcohols as well and found that damn near every single hair conditioner includes them in their ingredients so that might be whats causing your scalp issues. It definitely bothered mine and also caused deep angry pimples wherever it touched while rinsing it hairline back neck chest etc. A good rule of thumb when buying any kind of beauty product is that if its opaque and creamy it probably has fatty alcohols as a thickening agent so I always double check labels. I just discovered that SheaMoistures African Black Soap conditioner and Yucca amp Plantain conditioner dont contain fatty alcohols so Im super pumped to give those a try after not being able to use conditioners for so long.Also look out for emulsifying wax in products as cetearyl alcohol is a primary ingredient. Ive bought seemingly fatty alcoholfree products in the past only to still break out from them and emulsifying wax was the culprit.As for facial care I only really rinse my face with cold water and a washcloth apply Stridex in the morning then Dr. Lins Daily Hydrating Gel  minutes later usually two applications of the gel moisturizer because I live in the desert and one layer doesnt cut it here. At night I do the exact same routine only I swap Stridex for Makeup Artists Choice Mandelic Acid Toner. If Ive worn makeup that day I remove it with Garniers Skin Cleansing Micellar Cleansing Wipes before rinsing with water. Ive found that with my sensitive skin less is more and the fewer products with actives I have in my routine the better. Ive also been procrastinating using Nivea Creme as a moisturizer. Ive heard amazing things about it and it lacks the fatty alcohols but Im a bit wary about the lanolin oil. Gonna have to stop being a chicken and do a test patch on it.Hope this helps!,SkincareAddiction,d077w1p,4,t5_2tbbg

If youre allergic to benzoyl youll want to steer away from the kit.I hear using an AHA will help your skin a lot. I find that my skin is both oily and dry so I get patchy makeup at times.

A comedogenic oil applied to the face is very different from ingesting an oil.  The components of the ingested oil may or may not end up in the skin or sebum in a significant quantity.  Mineral oil is not even absorbed by the intestines but other oils may be.  If you have a true allergy ingestion or topical application may trigger an immune response systemically all though the body or locally at the site of application.  Eating too much sugar may spike blood glucose levels and insulin and that may change inflammatory pathways and make acne worse but putting table sugar on the skin is not going to change your blood sugar.  These are just examples but to sum up it is very hard to say what is the issue in your situation. ,SkincareAddiction,d0io98g,5,t5_2tbbg

6813829,0,t3_492ha5,In my personal experience I think you probably can especially if you have acne. It is important to remember that everyone is different and some people can probably handle the sluglife with no problems but some people cant. I had been hanging out in this sub for a long time when I went to my doctor about my acne. I had patch tested everything read up on everything and had a routine that seemed to work. But I was still suffering from acne. So when my doctor told me I should stop using moisturiser altogether while trying to get rid of my acne I literally went home and cried. I was convinced that my doctor just didnt know as much as I did about acne yeah I know heh. When I eventually was done feeling sorry for myself I decided to give it a chance. My skin was fucking horrible anyway so it couldnt get much worse. I took the antibiotics used the azelaic cream and stopped using moisturiser. I only used sunscreen azelaic cream mineral oil to remove make up and a foam cleanser. Three months later I have no more acne no more painful cysts no dry skin and no oily skin either. Two days ago I went out in daylight without wearing any make up at all for the first time in years and I felt great about myself.,SkincareAddiction,d0on84c,42,t5_2tbbg

6821713,0,t3_494iyv,I think others here have given you some great advice on possible routines already. However I wanted to chip in with my experience of seeing the GP about acne. They dont always prescribe tablets they can give you topical treatments instead. The best Ive tried personally is Adapalene cream which is a retinoid. I found it to be extremely gentle and non irritating. You can use it long term unlike other prescriptions such as topical antibiotics. Its easy to book a GP appointment and it doesnt cost you anything. They can give you something that has been proven to help and youll only have to pay the prescription charge. This is so much better than trying product after product if you ask me! Let me know if you have any questions or anything about seeing the GP. Ps the skin around your acne is looking really plump and healthy! ,SkincareAddiction,d0pjg3d,2,t5_2tbbg

6827153,0,t3_497ojn,In my experience I would say that yes my skin does get used to moisturizers over time. In some cases it will actually develop a negative reaction. I tried a really intense creamlike moisturizer from Clinique that worked like a charm for nearly two years. Once I ran out of it I went to Sephora to buy more but the company had changed the formula to make it more effective. In my opinion the new formula was weaker than the old one since my skin didnt absorb it as easily and would dry up ten minutes after application.Shortly after I tried using coconut oil and while it did a great job of moisturizing my skin it made me break out so I stopped using it. Then I moved on to aloe vera which has worked really well...until recently. Now not only does my skin dry up shortly after application but it will also turn red and start burning or get itchy in areas where the aloe vera was applied.,SkincareAddiction,d0q5ogn,1,t5_2tbbg

6876503,0,t3_49wxzx,No that wouldnt be an issue. If the moisturizer was applied properly it would already be absorbed into the skin. The purpose of having the oil applied on top is to occlude the skin and improve the function of the moisturizer below the oil. If the oil is applied to the skin before the moisturizer has been fully absorbed it would slow down the absorption but I dont think it would totally impede it and it would still have an occlusive effect on the ingredients that had already been absorbed.

Do you mean you recently switched cleansers to the biocura one?Cleansers are interesting because even if a specific cleanser isnt causing this problem for you the cleansers youre using might all be too harsh. Id recommend trying a lowpH cleanser to try and preserve the acid mantle of your skin so that you dont overproduce oil. Otherwise if you find that doesnt help you may just have oily skin or you may dislike the appearance of normal nonmatte skin. In that case theres nothing actually wrong with your skin its just an aesthetic you dislike. Blotting papers or mattifying powders would be your options then unless you wanted to pursue some sort of medication that could reduce sebum production. ,SkincareAddiction,d113710,1,t5_2tbbg

The manager at the salon was a laser technician with over a decade of experience and he claimed the machine he used works well for sun damage uneven skin tone and general maintenance of skin. He said I was a great candidate because of my skintone but I do need multiple sessions to completely remove my freckles. He also promised that Ill see significant improvement after my first session. During the sessionIt wasnt painful. It was just like the description feels like rubber band snapping against you. Not the most comfortable feeling but it wasnt too bad. The laser was done all over my face. ResultA few days after the treatment I did see some freckles surfacing and some were scabbing. However even after the scabs came off there were still some color. A few weeks later I did notice my pores looked a little smaller but my freckles were the same some were slightly lighter but not enough of a  difference. Conclusion For the price of what I paid for IPL I think I would rather spend a little more and go to a qualified dermatologist. My guess is that salons cant use machines with high power so thats why results take multiple sessions. BampAI found a before and after shot ,SkincareAddiction,d19nxc5,2,t5_2tbbg

7038065,0,t1_d1dxj2j,So it was oily before you started using topicals? And at that point you were only using cleanser and moisturizer? If so I also tend to doubt it was dehydrated gt oily. Has your skin always tended to be normal or oily rather than dry? Some people just have an oily skin type due to genetics. Hormones play a role as well some women with excessive amounts of androgens in their system will have oily skin. So the options for it . Genetic not much you can do except manage it . Hormonal birth control spironolactone Accutane isotretinoin works by reducing sebaceous glands which produce the oil. Though its considered a last resort type of medication people will oily skin tend to see their skin type normalize. You might want to get some blotting sheets as well as a mattifying powder or even a mattifying sunscreen maybe. And depending on which moisturizer you use a gel can feel lighter and less heavy on oily skin. And youll think Im crazy but the Oil Cleansing Method has really helped a lot of people with oily skin. Search the sub to read about OCM and oily skin.For now though Id wait to make any changes until you next see your dermatologist and talk it out with her. ,SkincareAddiction,d1e4d5q,2,t5_2tbbg

7062184,0,t3_4cc16w,Hairs also full of dirt and oil. Thats why its best to keep you hair away from your face to prevent breakouts. And try to wash hair at night rather than in the morning. Your hairs most dirty when you come home from outside from all kinds of activities and environment that you were exposed to. When you wash your hair though make sure you do it before washing your face. Washing face should be the last.And its very important to wash and moisturise your face BEFORE amp after exercising. Exercising promotes blood circulation and your pores are open as you are sweating and heating up. That means  all kinds of dirt can get into the pores and clog them. Also during the process you loose lots of moisture from your body. So drink some water bit by bit while exercising and also beforeafter. Dehydration and the increase in body temperature can also break out your skin. So make sure you keep an eye on those. So how do you wash your face? Wash your hands first. You should always start with warm water with lots of splashing on your skin to open up your pores then use cleanser. I dont know what kind of cleanser you use but if you use foaming cleanser then make good amount of foam in between your palms first then put on your face in rolling motions with your finger tips. When you do this make sure you focus on foreheadnosechin. And dont forget your ear areas too. When finishing off always use cool water not icy cold water to close the pores.Do you apply sunblock often? If so then I also recommend you to double cleanse your skin when washing on the days you put lots of sunblock. Washing thoroughly is very important as anything left onto skin can cause future breakouts. As always balancing PH level is very important. Make sure you use PH balanced skin care products for your skins optimum health. If your skins well balanced theres no way bacteria will grow on your skin .,SkincareAddiction,d1guy97,4,t5_2tbbg

7096141,0,t3_4cqoyx,I thought it was  off not anymore? I still will get stuff though lol The new Foreo facial thing I have the first one and I absolutely love it! But this new one has new settings that I really want to try out. Origins Nightamins cream thing i got it as  point perk and I havent used it on my face but Ive been using it on my neck for about  weeks and its amazing! My neck wrinkles have slowly been ...not disappearing but almost like theyre loosening up and my neck looks more healthy and supple.  Tarte has a lip thing that mixes with your PH level and changes the tone of your lips beautifully. I originally got it as a sample gift but I fell in love with it so I will definitely be getting the full size. The Foreo eye massager is so intriguing to me as well so that may be thrown onto my list too haha. I have tried many spot treatments and the only one that has actually worked for me is a combination between polysporin and clean and clears acne spot treatment. Together the polysporin helps to keep bacteria out helps to heal and keeps the skin on and around the zit moisturized so that the skin doesnt start flaking off and getting all gross looking. The clean and clear does its job by reducing the inflammation toning down the redness and drying out the zit.My friend has spoken wonders about the Mario Badescu I spelt that wrong didnt I?

7105025,0,t1_d1lpndr,This was something that worried me too. After reading a Swedish research review about there not being sufficient evidence for isotretinoin causing IBS or similar I decided to try it. It also discussed that there can actually be a link with bowel problems and acne in itself the acne being one of the symptoms of an inflammatory disease and not just a skin disease. There are several topicals than can be beneficial for acne azelaic acid tretinoin adapalene among others some can also be combined. You can discuss different options with your dermatologist.

7108364,0,t3_4cvb2s,I F took accutane more than once and it was by far the worst decision I have ever made and there isnt a single day that goes by that I dont wish I could go back in time and not take it. While I was on it the only side effects I noticed were dry skin dry lips a little bit of fatigue but it wasnt that bad. I ignored everyone that told me the really bad side effects dont usually happen until years later and boy were they right. I have severe IBS issues and chronic daily migraines which means that I have a migraine  and basically live my life on painkillers. I had to quit dancing quit playing music and I lost a ton of friends because I was in too much pain to go out and do things. Ive learned how to manage the pain relatively well over the years but Id be lying if I said my life wasnt extremely hard because of it. I read your comment where you talked about already having some IBS like symptoms and I promise you that they will become worse if you take accutane again. My brothers both took Accutane as well and they both also have severe IBS. And the worst part? We all still have mild acne. Accutane helps a lot while youre on it but once you stop your acne comes back for different reasons. PLEASE message me if you have any questions about my experience with accutane. I advocate against it as much as I possibly can so that other people dont have to live life like I do. Ive also researched it and joined multiple forums on different websites where people who have taken accutane are trying to figure out what it actually did to our bodies and how to reverse it.,SkincareAddiction,d1m3z3r,2,t5_2tbbg

7146241,0,t3_4dfcub,I live in Australia too and have actually looked into this brand before. I assume youre talking about this night cream. The website doesnt list the entire ingredient list but the reason I dismissed this brand initially was the fact that they use many irritating plant oils that are actually harmful to skin such as lavender orange lemon grapefruit etc.. These oils can damage and irritate the skin and citrus oils are even phototoxic meaning when exposed to daylight they can increase sun damage and hyperpigmentation.Other than that they seem to be a fan of jar packaging. Jar packaging is problematic especially when one uses many active ingredients. They rapidly become unstable when exposed to oxygen plus youre also dipping your fingers into the jar over an over again. Even when you wash your hands before doing so skin cells and other bacteria will get in.Its not a waste to invest in good quality skincare and the cheapest moisturiser at a pharmacy is unlikely to be the best option out there but there is a middle ground. The olay sunscreen you use is good for starters. Olay has many good quality serums and moisturisers. Always make sure you look for skincare without fragrance and denatured alcohol and fragrant plant oils. This may not be easy initially since you have to memorise to some extent which ones are harmful and which ones are not. Pomegranate extract and cucumber extract are fine for example.Priceline stocks a moisturiser for sensitive skin from people for plants that is great. Other than that I really like Paulas Choice and Drunk Elephant products. The key ingredients I always look for are niacinamide vitamin C vitamin E and Hyaluronic acid.

7151573,0,t3_4dhtcn,Why are you washing your face midday? Is this due to gym or a sports practice? How long have you been on the clindamycin and tretinoin? My dermatologist and pharmacist both stated that when used together at night clindamycin first let dry then use tretinoin they can be more effective. You can still use the clindamycin again in the morning. Maybe ask your derm about doing the clindamycin twice a day. Also both those prescriptions cause UV sensitivity. You must use sunscreen every day unless you are  certain you will be indoors away from windows from dawn to dusk. Tretinoin especially can do more harm then good when used improperly wout sunscreen. If you dont have time before catching a bus or driving to school then keep sunscreen in your backpack or locker. The foaming cleanser may be too harsh for your sensitive skin. What cream cleansers have you tried? Have you tried the oil cleansing method?Also vitamin C serums do chemically exfoliate the skin. When the skin is already damaged and sensitive this can sometimes be too much. How long have you been using the C? It may be best to use it in the mornings since it does have some UVprotective effects. I would suggest gentle cleansing pat dry C  wait for it to soakdry clindamycin then moisturizer and sunscreen.Depending on how long youve been using your current routine you may want to revisit your dermatologist.,SkincareAddiction,d1r28yy,3,t5_2tbbg

7273013,0,t3_4eye0c,I have normalcombination but somewhat dehydrated sensitive acne prone skin and I am obsessed with just about every Sunday Riley product Ive used. I first started using Good Genes over  years ago and it really cleared up my skin in terms of tone and breakouts. I use it every morning on top of Skinceuticals CE Ferulic treatment and follow it up with a small pump of the Drunk Elephant B Hydra Intensive Hydration Gel a hydrating face mist and one of my various moisturizers and eye creams depending on the weather and if Im planning to wear makeup I live in Florida. I bought a bottle of Luna right after it launched in Sephora and I have been obsessed with it ever since. I can say that hands down its my favorite skincare product Ive ever used. I have a lot of redness in my skin that has gone away since using Luna and my skin is so radiant that Ive had to drop a shade in my foundation. The only qualm I had with it initially is that it didnt seem to absorb fully at first but I use it nightly and follow up with May Lindstroms Blue Cocoon as my face and eye cream and it absorbs completely and my skin feels heavenly when I wake up every morning. I use Ceramic Slip twice a day and when I run out of my Eve Lom cleansing balm I plan on switching over to Blue Moon for double cleansing at night. I love Ceramic Slip and use it with my Clarisonic every morning. I have it set up on autodelivery on Amazon to save some money on it. I live in the middle of nowhere so I have a lot of stuff on autodelivery so I save  on each shipment which is a big help. I bought Tidal when it came out on presale for VIB Rouge on Sephora and its a perfect day cream for me but I need more at night. Its very light and its so hydrating that I almost feel as if its cooling upon application. I like it a lot and plan on repurchasing it when I run out. I also bought the Effortless Breathable Primer and I like the feel and look of that a lot but its definitely more makeup and not skincare so I wont go more in depth on it unless someone has miraculously read this far and wants to hear more about it. The one thing Ive tried from SR that I didnt love is the Artemis oil. I cant handle the smell and I usually am very tolerant of smells in products. I also felt like the oil was very thick and didnt absorb into my skin very well. I may have gotten a badold batch from Sephora. I bought it back in January but the packaging was older blackyellowwhite instead of blackbluewhite but I cant find an exp date on the product. TLDR Im obsessed with SR and I use a hefty majority of her line. ,SkincareAddiction,d24w5ie,1,t5_2tbbg

7299213,0,t3_4fcvma, Which moisturizer are you using? A lot of moisturizers contain fatty alcohols which are a nono for a lot of acne prone folks so I would check my ingredients list for them. Im not familiar with the calendula soap but if thats a bar soap those have a high pH which can exacerbate acne prone skin. Low pH cleansers are generally advised here on the sub. Also I would mention that I previously used the Cosrx  Whitehead liquid and found it very irritating to my skin which isnt sensitive at all gave me a fine red facial rash. I switched to Mizon  AHA and the irritation disappeared right away. You may not experience the same but thought I would throw that out there since Ive seen this complaint about the Cosrx  from a few other people over on the Asian Beauty sub as well.  Edited to add if youre using an AHA you should start using sunscreen as AHAs make skin more photosensitive and will increase wrinkling and sunspots with sun exposure.,SkincareAddiction,d27vd15,2,t5_2tbbg

7339671,0,t1_d2bx9j0,I wouldnt say better they just have different qualities. Avobenzone is better at the higher end of the UVA spectrum but is less broad and less stable than Tinosorb S.The reason American sunscreens are said to be worse is because there is only one chemical UVAprotecting option to use whereas EuropeanAsianetc. sunscreens have multiple choices that are quite often used together in one product.So nonAmerican sunscreens are not all better than American sunscreens. They just have the ability to be much better by using more than one ingredient in an effort to cover the various sections of the UVA spectrum. If a sunscreen is using only Tinosorb S I would not say its better than your average American sunscreen with  stabilized avobenzone.In my opinion its more important that you found a sunscreen you are willing to use every day in Biore and Tinosorb S will last longer than Avobenzone if youre not a fan of reapplying your daily sunscreen.,SkincareAddiction,d2cgy5n,1,t5_2tbbg

7578254,0,t3_4j4ddv,Sorry to hear about your mom. I dont know that I can help you with all of your concerns but I think the most important thing is you always take the time to research items and patch test. I know reading information can be overwhelming but its important to not just always assume everything you read as gospel. You see a lot of bad advice given in magazines and online etc so be sure to research things. Also keep in mind everyone is different so what works for others may not work for you. If you havent already find a good obgyn and get an exam. You can ask them questions related to any part of your health not just womans health. If you have insurance you may be able to get a physical for a low amount of money. If money is too tight consider saving up so you can visit a doctor one day. You can ask them about your thinning hair that is falling out or why your nails are so brittle it could be you are deficient in a certain vitamin. I dont use shaving cream but I have in the past. Hopefully someone more well informed can respond but honestly Im lazy and if I use anything I just use conditioner. I do tend to have dry skin but I have found actually using lotion will help. I just bought a bottle of lotion from a drugstore and I keep it on the bathroom sink so after I shower I make sure to moisturize head to toe. This helps lock in moisture and Ive noticed my skin softening especially on my legs. If you have stray hairs when it comes to shaving your armpits it helps to go in all directions to get all the hairs. Face and eye creams can be started at any age but given that you have a budget Id focus on finding a good sunscreen. You can research more items as you budget grows but if your skin is overall great on its own Id be careful introducing a bunch of new products. I wish I could help more with thinning hair but I look like cousin it. Wish I could give you some of mine! I will note that you said you are losing weight. I noticed when I was not eating a well balanced diet and eating way too low calorie count my hair began to fall out. Make sure with weight loss that you are doing it in a healthy way. Otherwise it might help to visit a good hair salon and talk to a stylist about your concerns. Aside from adding in products to help sometimes a good haircut can make a big difference. Your nails sound concerning Id research that but it could be you just have brittle nailsthin hair. A nail hardening nail polish may help but it sounds like you could be deficient in a certain vitamin. I know someone who had brittle nails from their thyroid after vitamin b shots she noticed an improvement. It may or may not be the case for you just something to look into when speaking to a doctor. I wish I knew what would tighten skin! From what I read in regard to weight loss and loose skin is to drink plenty of water and lose weight at a healthy pace. Keep the skin moisturized and look into strength training so as you lose fat you also build muscle. I am researching dry brushing right now and Im not sure if it really does help. Some people claim it does and some people claim it doesnt but I bought a brush and I use it in the shower. I have no idea if it really helps with cellulite etc but I like the exfoliation.  Not really beauty routine advice but if you do want to look more put together consider your wardrobe. If you have no problem in that area I get it but sometimes people dont realize they wear clothes that are ill fitted to their body or just styles that do not flatter them. Some people look amazing in orange.. some people just dont. etc You get the point. I find even if I cant control my acne to the point that I have skin like snow white feeling good in my clothes helps a lot. Plus having accessories that really pulls together an outfit. Not related to a beauty ritual but I think sometimes as women we are afraid a lot. Afraid to try new things afraid to speak up etc. Hopefully this is not the case for you but if it is Id encourage you to live the life you want not the life that society deems you should be living. If you want to take a job across the country  take the job. If you want to break up because things just arent working out break up that doesnt mean you will be alone forever.

Its helpful to list it out. Did you use antibacterial creams or something which increases cell turnover like tretinoin? One cause not listed in that link is fungal acne and for that you want zinc pyrithione. If youre a woman it could be hormonal acne. Taking spironolactone helps immensely with that.If you want to switch derms I highly recommend Curology. Theyre pretty good at determining whether its acne cause by hormones bacteria or fungus and they prescribed the correct treatment for it.

7600371,0,t3_4jf2jo,Unfortunately Water isnt the answer to all your skin problems. Everyone is different. The amount of water you should be drinking depends on your height and weight I think. Water will help with the hydration of your skin but perhaps you are lacking in vitamins or skincare. I have started taking evening primrose oil capsules and applying rosehip oil which has been helping improve my skin. I always moisturize and exfoliateregularly and  use face masks for when I think my skin is feeling flat. Diet is important too. What you put in is what you get out.

7660936,0,t1_d3czsjo,Usually the max dose is mg per kilogram that you weigh so I think you might have misunderstood.  The length of the treatment definitely varies per person depending on how much you can handle.  If you did a low dose for  months you might not experience as many side effects but you would be on the drug for  months and maybe not see progress as quickly.  I ended up completing my course in  months actually.  Its the total dose that you take that matters.,SkincareAddiction,d3d06ul,1,t5_2tbbg

For me I was confusing my face with different products inconsistent routine and my work schedule. I had no idea what my underlying skin problems are... acne prone sensitive oily combination dry.... I feel like I have it all. So I decided to start from scratch. I am only double cleansing oil cleanser followed by foam then moisturizing then sunscreen. It is hard to resist using the other products I have. I am throwing in sheet masks two nights a week for fun. Theyre simple aloemoisturizing ones.

7731357,0,t3_4l5k7z,Is it still red or is that just the lighting? Like I get that there is a noticeable skin change but did it ever fade to brown or is it still redpink? Is there heat coming off it? Obviously the skin looks damage but Id be shock if the burn is still there instead of just damaged skin.I damaged my skin severely a few year ago. I had to wear an all black dress on a lawn at high noon in what was at least  degree weather four hours. I was even wearing heavy duty sunscreen something like  SPF but the parts by my shoulders the only part that got burnt got whipped off by the sleeves of my dress somehow. It was the worst burn of my life. It was peeling for weeks. It took about  years for the damange to repair itself and the color to fade back normal. That was when I was  or . Im  now and I only have a slight darkening on my shoulder and forearms which I believe is just from current daily sun contact. No noticeable tan line anymore either. So while it sucks and it will take some more time this probably still will heal. Give it another year or two. And stay out of the sun and use sunscreen in the meantime. ,SkincareAddiction,d3l00vp,4,t5_2tbbg

I went in for a bleeding and nonhealing mole within a couple days from my call when it would have been weeks to get in with my PA or much worse to get in with the dermatologist.

7884617,1,t3_4na3qa,omg  keep an eye on those. If you notice or even think you notice signs of infection get in to see your Doctor immediately or even consider going to the ER.That could get nasty very quickly and being as close to your brain as that is  infection could really set you up for a terrible time.Frankly  I would consult with a vet about the cat. Get himher checked out to make sure there is nothing untoward going on there. We found out our stray cat that we had only allowed into the house a few days earlier had infected nail beds. When my husband picked him up he inadvertently touched or lightly squeezed a foot and the cat immediately scratched his face as he was in terrible pain. If your cat checks out as physically okay you might want to warn others  especially children  to limit their interactions with himher and to certainly never attempt picking himher up. Once you have been attacked and another also gets attacked that leaves you open for being sued because the court will say that you had knowledge of the cat being dangerous.Theres a lot to think about here besides skin issues but those are important too. You take care. Keep a close eye on the injury and act immediately if you suspect infection. Get your cat into the vet ASAP to be checked out also.You take care  I wish you well.Nana internet hug,SkincareAddiction,d42ay3o,2,t5_2tbbg

I cant think of any properties to it off the top of my head that would reduce dark circles. In fact it might make it worse since its a bit drying. Moisture can help but not a lot is going to reduce the color.Tea bags always helped mine temporarily. Might work better if I did them regularly. Green tea in particular I think. The caffeine in them helped a bit.Not sure on your second question Ive been wondering about that myself. If oils on your face mess with the effectiveness of sunscreen and other products.,SkincareAddiction,d42ldxc,5,t5_2tbbg
7887783,0,t1_d42euau,It could be one of you makeup products... Also do you use any sort of spot treatment sulfur benzoyl peroxide etc because that could help you target individual pimples. Maybe try switching up your foundationsbb creams to see if it goes away? Oh here wait are you removing your sunscreen and makeup before you wash your face? Cetaphil wont be able to clean your pores if you still have stuff on.Edit typo,SkincareAddiction,d42nrhs,1,t5_2tbbg

7888325,0,t3_4na3qa,This exact thing happened to me but my face instead of my neck. I had to get stitches on my upper lip well liquid stitches because the scratch there was wider than your worst one and was gaping. I had less severe scratches on my cheeks and then all the way down my neckstomach to my hip bones. The only scratch that left a scar was the one that needed stitches and even it is very light. Most people are surprised when I mention it because they didnt notice it on their own. I dont know that I could even get a picture of it to show you. If I wear makeup its not visible at all. I kept mine constantly moist with Aquaphor and as still as possible since it was on my lip talking pulled on it. I cleaned them daily but as gently as possible. As soon as they closed I started religiously applying ScarGuard and gently massaging with jojoba oil. I avoided the sun entirely until I felt the skin could handle sunscreen then I made sure it was always protected when I went outside. It took about  months for it to heal and look normal again. It healed much sooner than that but the scar was red instead of whitepale pink like it is now. Im quite fair so the scar blends in better with my skin tone more than it might with someone with darker skin.My cat has seizures so now we keep plastic claw caps on him to prevent him from hurting me or himself.,SkincareAddiction,d42pyei,1,t5_2tbbg

7904832,0,t1_d44gs8e,No. Its entirely dependent on which types of oils you are using and how well you cleanse afterward. Some oils have amazing cosmetic benefits and others like OP stated are better left as foodstuff. I have been using oils not olive or coconut though to moisturize my skin my entire lifeno exaggerationand have done so without issue. I recommend you try albolene as your makeup remover if youre worried about the safety of the oils youre usingits mainly mineral oil its cheap and it has been popular for generations.

7908293,0,t1_d44yghe,It all depends on you skin type but I like to start with an absolute fresh face in the morning. A toner is the runny liquid that is typically applied with a cotton ball to balance the skins PH after cleansing and also get any last bits of dirt or grime that was missed by your cleanser. A sign of a good cleanser is when the cotton ball comes away clean while toning. Some people dont use it I find it an absolutely necessary step for my skin especially in these hot upcoming months. ,SkincareAddiction,d44yts5,1,t5_2tbbg

7918078,0,t1_d45tdqh,I use the mask once a week. I sometimes like to throw a hydrating mask on after that just to replace any moisture that was lost in the masking process. but as far as reducing pores thats literally all Ive done. After using it for  weeks my pores on my nose were almost invisible! No SF in sight! The best part about this mask IMO is that you can get a pound of it at Whole Foods for like  and apple cider vinegar is pretty cheap too again I got a giant thing at whole foods for like . The package says its good for  masks but honestly I feel like its closer to  depending on how much you use. Super affordable and super effective. Edit This stuff is an intense detoxifier so if you have a few pimples pop up afterwards dont worry. The mask is pulling all the gross stuff in your pores up to the surface which sometimes means pimples after the first use.

There are noncomedogenic nongreasy sunscreens. There are links in the sidebar to find some recommendations. I personally use a clear zinc sunscreen and find that it goes on super matte and zinc can actually help heal acne and other skin problems so that might be a good option for you. Sun exposure worsens hyperpigmentation period. The first step to reducing hyperpigmentation is to find a good sunblock so you arent making the problem worse and then add active ingredients. Plus antibiotics like doxycycline increase photosensitivity.,SkincareAddiction,d48x3az,1,t5_2tbbg

I know dealing with this is already stressful. Once I was off Doxy and my skin worsened I immediately went on LabDoor to see which probiotic supplements were best and after a couple weeks of taking them x daily I saw it start to calm down. It takes time though to replenish the good gut bacteria so you have to stick with it. After that my Curology derm took the Clindamycin out of my formula and bumped the Tretinoin up to . My skin purged quite a bit but now its cleared up and has helped resurface my skin. Its mostly just a lot of PIE to deal with now.

Any advice on the TonyMoly wash would be greatly appreciated!,SkincareAddiction,d4n5frt,1,t5_2tbbg
8071239,0,t3_4pqk2b,the only thing that got rid of my deep pimples was changing my diet nothing topical ever helped  so i dont really have any product recommendations for those  in regards to to evening out skin tone  maybe an AHA or vitamin c would help? i found vitamin C evened out a lot of the redness around my nose and cheeks. I use derma e overnight peel as my AHA and my face looks a lot more refreshed and and even in the morning when i go to wash  ,SkincareAddiction,d4na881,1,t5_2tbbg

8136123,0,t3_4qn6tz,You probably dont apply it enough but either way I suggest using BOTH chemical and physical sunscreens to someone who is very sensitive to sun. First put on chemical sunscreen make sure you apply evenly everywhere wait for  minutes. Then apply physical sunscreen preferably zinc oxide based as its a little better than titanium dioxide at sun protection.If you have oily skin or if two sunscreens might be heavyoily for you choose one of them oilfree. Derma E has a zinc oxide based SPF  sunscreen.It sounds like you are very sensitive to sun so I would not recommend using only physical sunscreen. They basically work like a mask thats why they are called physical sunscreens. But in summer when you sweat they might run down a little. Chemical  physical would be safer at least for the days you will spend a lot of time outside.,SkincareAddiction,d4ukois,3,t5_2tbbg

Just apply one I recommend the vitamin C first wait a few minutes or so for it to dry down then apply the next and repeat.  However I would not suggest using the BHA and AHA twice in one day. Use them either morning or night but not both. Vitamin C you can use both AM amp PM.For the niacinamide serum I suggest using this last and waiting at least  minutes after your last low pH serum.

8258938,0,t3_4siiyg,If youre looking for a routine I would recomend a gentle cleanser an AHA or BHA for exfoliation and a good moisturizer.A lot of people have recommended BHAAHA but not really explained them so heres a quick bit of info on them...I would recommend using a salicylic acid treatment to chemically exfoliate the skin and get rid of the trapped dead skin cells which can cause acne. It sort of dissolves the glue that holds skin cells together allowing them to exfoliate from your face instead of getting trapped or stuck on. A lot of users recommend stridex in the red box! because its easy to buy inexpensive and works well. I have sensitive skin and am irritated by stridex so other users have recommended Paulas Choice products. Both of these products are at the correct pH and formula to be effective. Some other products like face cleansers Neutrogena St. Ives etc. to name a few are cleansers that have SA in them but they are not at the right pHformulation to be very effective and also may contain harsh physical abrasives to exfoliate. They also contain physical exfoliates that can be abrasive on the skin and do more harm than good. SA can be very drying so start slow once or twice a week and slowly work your way up slowly. I would highly recommend using a moisturizer after applying the SA  minutes after is ideal but  minutes is fine to help alleviate the dryness. Hope this helps a little bit! let me know if you have any questions.,SkincareAddiction,d59xaj8,1,t5_2tbbg

The needle they use to do the fill also helps break down the scar tissue causing the depression so you may never need to have it redone.

8493107,0,t3_4w00pj,Hey there! Tretinoin retina etc. can be pretty beneficial for skin. Sometimes used as an acne treatment but it also has awesome effects such as evening skin tone and texture and reducing fine lines and wrinkles and reducing scars! Kind of a holy grail product if you ask me.  It works by communicating at a cellular level causing your skin cells to go through their life cycle quicker. Salicylic acid works differently by breaking down the glue that holds skin cells together and letting them exfoliate from your face. Usually its best to start with . and then you slowly work your way up. When using retina products heres some good guidelines to follow . In the evening use a gentle cleanser to wash your face.. Pat dry.. Wait at least  minutes before applying a pearl sized amount of retina to your face and neck. Otherwise it will absorb too quickly and cause a lot of irritation.You should do this only  times a week only at night and then gradually increase in frequency as your skin adjusts. The major side effects tend to be dry peeling skin. If this happens decrease the frequency of your applications and remember to apply moisturizers day and night to help give some moisture back to your skin. I tend to have very oily skin so Im usually okay with just applying a light moisturizer in the evening after the tretinoin and a bit early in the morning. But if you have dry skin or combination skin you will need a pretty heavy duty moisturizer. It can be a couple months before you see results and have improved skin but it helps with fine lineswrinkles acne skin texture and scars as I mentioned before. On days that I dont apply the tretinoin I do a  SA topical solution to help exfoliate skin. If you dont want to use the SA and tret at the same time I would use the SA in the morning because tret needs to be applied at night. If you want to use both at night then first you would cleanse use the SA and then the retinol try to wait at least  minutes between product applications. Let me know if you have any questions or if something doesnt make sense.,SkincareAddiction,d636rik,1,t5_2tbbg

8494541,0,t3_4vqfd2,The best thing for them if you can treat immediately at the time of the breakout starting is a prescription Valtrex or creams. Abbreva is your next bet. Ive had luck with high doses of lysine to minimize the length of the breakout. Another thing Ive had luck with after its broken out into a scab is to try to soak in peroxide probably not recommended to close to the mouth but it dries out the scab quickly. Are you sure its a cold sore and not just cracked lips? Often people will have dry lips which will crack and become painful. Cold sores usually start with small bumps on the skin. Another home remedy btw is holding an ice cube on it to reduce inflammation. Ive also had good experiences wth that although it doesnt dry it up and allow it to heal faster.

8515745,0,t3_4wd1py,I had a VERY similar experience. Its a result of an impaired skin barrier function. The products you are using ARE NOT compatible with your skin. The best way to go forward and what I did is completely eliminate everything except a cleanser for nightly use. This gave my skin time to heal and allowed me to see what it did on its own.

8560822,0,t3_4x0xni,Your skin should not be dry or be dried out without sufficient moisturizer. The reason behind this this is that when you dry your skin sebaceous glands starts to produce sebum at an increased rate to remoisturize your skin. This can in turn make you break out. I do not know what reacts with your skin but I have to use an oilfree moisturizer and maybe that can help with you. Other than that try a BHA or AHA for your forehead as this chemically removes dead skin cells and keeps your skin fresh use an AHA or BHA let it dry for around  mins and apply a moisturizer. Forehead acne is really hard to deal with at least it takes time for me so just follow my advice and give it extra time. Also do NOT pop the pimples and try not to touch your forehead.Good luck ,SkincareAddiction,d6bohfg,1,t5_2tbbg

8598593,0,t3_4xlfpr,The best way is to properly patch test see sidebar for how to patch test. After patch testing a product introduce one skincare product at a time all over your face. How long to wait before you introduce a new product kind of depends on your skin skin history and type of product you are using. Some people do a week. Some two weeks. Some do a whole month your skin renews itself every  days. Some even only do a few days. It is a slow process but it really is the only way to gauge the effect a product has on your skin. When I started a whole new routine I started testing out using only my new cleanser at first since you need a good cleanser to remove buildup from other skincare products. Your skin shouldnt be left feeling tight and dry from a cleanser. If you are female and break out more during that time of the month try introducing a new product at a different time so you dont mix up the reason you are breaking out. ,SkincareAddiction,d6gf07a,4,t5_2tbbg

8627299,0,t1_d6j1zum,If you feel like it helps you can use your BP and BHAs too. So if its necessary for your skin go for it. It is recommended to apply BP at a different time of day at least  hours apart than prescription tretinoin. BP oxidizes tretinoin deactivating the tretinoin. DifferinAdapalene is an exception and can be applied at the same time as BP if you dont get extra irritation.BHA meant for daily use not talking about professional level peels can be applied at the same time of day as prescription tretinoin. There is mixed opinions about apply BHA and AHA at the same time as an OTC retinol and I honestly dont though much about that. Regardless tretinoin is already in retinoic acid form so you dont have to worry about the pH level of a BHA potentially interacting with a conversion from retinol to retinoic acid. Some people dont recommend applying a BHA at the same time because of irritation but if you dont get irritation you can apply it at the same time of day. If you get irritation obviously apply at a different time of day.I  like to apply my daily liquid  BHA after cleansing wait at least  minutes to let skin dry then apply my tretinoin. In general I like to put my safe for allover low pHdependent products on first.If you are using a very strong BHA concentration like  that is only meant for spot treatment you can apply it as your last step over moisturizer. Or you can technically apply it anywhere in your routine as long as your wait for your skin to fully absorb it. You dont want another product to pick up a very high dose of BHA that is not meant for all over and move it to areas of the face where it can irritate your skin. I  like to apply my very powerful spot treatments for those stubborn spots as my last step over my moisturizer in both the AM and PM.,SkincareAddiction,d6k0l9m,1,t5_2tbbg

It is good enough in a pinch like better than nothing after a long night if there is no way youre washing your face before you fall asleep but otherwise I always use micellar water just as a first step to remove makeup and then follow by actually washing my face and applying my skincare products. Might be OK in the morning if you dont use much on your face at night but Id still at least rinse afterward since it will inevitably leave a light residue on the skin. ,SkincareAddiction,d6mco0t,2,t5_2tbbg

Downside of this one is that its really messy and rather time consuming.. Veet wax strips. Available on amazon or drug stores. Very easy to use and cleaner than sugaring though sugaring does seem to get the hair out better.For aftercare I quickly cool the skin in cold water apply aloe literally cut from a plant I have at home dry then pat on some Nivea creme.,SkincareAddiction,d6xjk81,2,t5_2tbbg

8772917,0,t1_d71t1ga,So I agree that the FDA has been dragging its feet for far too long in approving newer third generation filters like Tinosorb MS Uvinal A Plus etc. Certainly the US is still using second generation filters. However on your comment about proportionate protection because critical wavelength is not an absolute measurement it will always be proportional to a products SPF. So the higher the advertised SPF the more UVA protection the product must provide assuming the product carries the broad spectrum labelling. The critique that many throw at this is that while critical wavelength measures the breadth of protection measured in nm it doesnt account for the height or amplitude of protection. Thats where the EUs  PFA requirement comes in. ,SkincareAddiction,d72a4mb,1,t5_2tbbg
8773281,0,t3_509nnb,That looks awful I am so sorry. I have eczema only on the outside of my hands and wrists.Try using Infadolan on your eczema  its cheap at around  a tube from the Own Doc web shop. Its lanolin based and designed to help skin recover from laser and to help wounds heal after surgery. Its a very thick ointment so you only need to use a small amount. It could replace the white petroleum jelly that you use. Im not sure how much of a difference it may make for you but its not expensive and worth a try.You might also consider an oral antihistamine like Allersoothe  mg generic or Phenergen mg branded which makes you drowsy will relieve itching and help you sleep. The active ingredient is promethazine.You might want to try CeraVe hydrating cleanser for your hands at work and their eczema products they have an eczema soothing body wash a healing ointment and an itch ointment  hydrocortisone. Again none of these are expensive    each.Eczema mainly reoccurs due to stress and exposure to an irritant. I would strongly advise you to stop using the ACV and sea salt treatment I have never heard of this as a recommendation for treatment. Lavender is also a known skin irritant. With eczema the plainer and more boring the cream the better.  What might help is a bleach bath or wet wraps. Obviously bleach baths are dangerous unless you know what you are doing. I have never needed one but please do your research before attempting one or you could do more damage if the bleach isnt sufficiently diluted.For wet wraps the idea is to wrap wet bandages over your hands preferably at night after cleansing and applying a moisturising cream prescription cream like CeraVe and an ointment like Infadolan. Again it is easy to find information on how to perform wet wraps online. They are probably the safer option compared to a bleach bath.The rest is lifestyle  make sure you use unscented laundry liquid to wash your clothes towels and sheets. Wash your towels and sheets at a high temperature over  degrees celsius to kill bacteria and change your towels especially twice a week. Try to shower in warm water only  hot water can irritate your skin and make the eczema worse.,SkincareAddiction,d72brom,1,t5_2tbbg

I was using two to three pumps before I asked someone at Sephora how many I should use they said I should be able to get by with only one and thats been working out fine I just wasnt sure how much to use before. From my research reading a lot of reviews all over the bottle should last  months. It feels very light. I use it after cleansing and toning in the morning and even with sunscreen concealer and foundation on top of it it feels like theres nothing on my face I dont use a ton of foundation and of course YMMV depending on what you use. I love the packaging because its opaque and airtight so airlight isnt going to ruin the product. Due to the packaging it supposedly has a shelf life of  months. The only downside to the packaging is that I dont know how much is left. Overall I love it ,SkincareAddiction,d7nozbv,3,t5_2tbbg

8968754,0,t3_534hag,This exact same reaction happened to me when I tried clindamycin .  benzoyl peroxide .. My skin became immediately hot when applied but I figured Id power through it anyway no pain no gain right? I woke up with severe rednessirritation severe itching and severe swelling around my eyes one was almost swollen shut. I didnt apply it on my eyelids but the cream migrated and I have supremely sensitive skin.It was so bad for me that I went to an urgent care facility and they categorized it as an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients and to discontinue use immediately. Went to my primary doctor who prescribed it and again was told it was likely an allergic reaction and to not use it again. Neither could confirm which was the offender without testing and I wasam still unwilling to try it. I always had a feeling it was the benzoyl peroxide though and seeing this just confirms it in my mind.If I were you I would contact my doctor and restate my previous reaction while addressing the current one and try to schedule an earlier appointment. If you were fine on adapalene alone before I believe theres an increased dose of . that you could look into trying.

9041015,0,t3_542khe,You dont have to eliminate them completely. What worked for me was taking  capsules of apple cider vinegar after one of my meal which helps your digestive system to break down fat. I am very serious about working out so my diet always include meat therefore fat as well. But i eat clean meaning i cook chicken with dry spice instead of sauces i bake over fry. Avoid fast food as much as possible.  Try to reduce the amount of unhealthy fat intake. Add spinach and broccoli to your diet it helps to reach your daily vitamin need. Lots of water lots of veggies. And for your carbs try to eat drier stuff like rice sweet potato and oats instead of bread cereal and fries. I spend  bucks on groceries every month so it defintely cost less than eating fast food. Plus i can eat very healthy. For flavoring i replace salt with a sweet roast garlic seasoning and i basically try to not eat sugar. I make my food in a bulk and store it in a container for enough food to last me at least  to  days worth of meals. That saves me time over the week where i can use to study or do other things.,SkincareAddiction,d7yl3sb,1,t5_2tbbg

9066064,0,t3_54fnfa,I agree with all of the other commenters. One other thing that may help is to really try your best to only go over the area once when shaving. Work in small patches and make sure your razor has no hair before working on the next patch making sure to not go over the same area. Your skin may be really sensitive to the razor in that area so going over it less is better. I also find that when shaving anywhere my skin prefers my razor blade to be cold so I use cold water to rinse it between removing the hair. As an added tip make sure the skin is nice and taught so the razor glides across the skin easier.

If you dont use too much eye cream since a little typically goes a long way then patting doesnt take long. I also apply eye cream after toning and before treatments to help protect the area in case any actives creep up there.

You can also add a low percentage AHA for fine lines around the mouth. Are your dark under eyes genetic?? Otherwise it could be a sign of dehydration. Make sure your lotion contains hyaluronic acid which will help plump out fine lines. ,SkincareAddiction,d8fuvb0,1,t5_2tbbg
9183824,0,t1_d8fupcg,See My skin is very photosensitive so I have no choice and have to do this with chemical sunscreens especially. I basically just wipe my face a bit reapply some ss almost never the required amount but its better than nothing and Ive personally found reapplying throughout the day instead of applying the required amount ONCE is more effective in the long run wait a few minutes then apply some powder and Im done. It doesnt have to be complicated and it doesnt really turn my makeup but I mostly just wear powder foundation and eyeliner.If I dont reapply for hours and then I go outside and get full exposure I can feel my skin burning so I know its not just a recommendation. I know for physical sunscreens its more of an issue with the ss being rubbed or sweated off as opposed to being used up by the sun like chemical sunscreens. I would stick with physical ss if it werent for the white cast and in some cases not providing strong enough uv protection for me personally. ,SkincareAddiction,d8g48a3,5,t5_2tbbg

9393998,0,t3_5992jd,Just wanted to comment and let you know that you are definitely not alone! Having acne is exhausting. I remember times where I would cry because of my frustrations. Even today I get selfconscious about how people see me withwithout makeup on. Some questions to considerWhat is your current routine including product name?Have you visited a dermatologist?Some tips Ive learnedCollege for me was great. I met classmates who cared about academics and did not care about how I looked on the outside. That didnt mean that I wasnt selfconscious but the moment I started showing my bare face was when I realized that many people didnt even notice. There was a moment where I thought makeup was the acne culprit. I spent many hours researching which products to buy. I went to Sephora and would ask for samples instead of purchasing the items. If there was any doubt that a product was irritating my skin itchiness etc then I would return it. So while you continue wearing makeup why not continue wearing it but at least have products that are suited for your skin. For example I love matte foundations for oil control. I really like oil cleansers followed by a gentle cleanser because theyve proven to remove the most makeup for me. Then Ill follow up with micellar water. It sounds like a lot of products but its really gentle on my skin. Once I figured out that makeup wasnt it I started noting down the dates of my breakouts. I also noted where on my face I was breaking out. Thanks to this sub I was able to do some research and found out that my breakouts came around the time of my period.

9421803,0,t3_592neb,How much time should you give your skin to get used to one product before starting another? Context Started a basic routine just over  weeks ago only a cleanser and moisturizer. No reactions so far! I want to add a BHA stridex if I can get it off Canadian Amazon or the neutrogena rapid clear pads to help with SF but Im not sure if I should give my skin longer to adjust.

9424207,0,t1_d9akhgx,yeah sorry im not familiar with US products im from EU. But i do know that there is  different creams for people that really tried ANYTHING. Elidel and Protopic. Dont know about the US but in EU doctors only prescribe them as a last resort because they are relatively new products and there are no long lasting studies on the side effects. So maybe bring that up to your derm? Or if your derm sucks then switch to a better one.

Definitely check out the sidebar but I would also suggest you use a sunscreen going forward I recommend the Laroche Posay fluid as it will help out with fading whatever scars you have. I would also suggest cleansing with a Cerave cleanser and following with a Cerave lotion.

9459922,0,t3_5a6uzm,Dermstore is legit. The only issue youll ever encounter is a looming product expiration date since so much of their catalog is overstock and stuff that was shifted to other retailers after packaging updates.Amazon is trickier since pretty much everyone can sign up as a merchant to sell whatever they want. I go by my knowledge of the brand Im buying. If Im ordering from Amazon its because Im looking for free shipping otherwise Id just order from the brand site. There are certain types of products that dont lend themselves to counterfeiting. Id say anything that has a reasonably high shipping weight while having a low official price Like a large tube of cream or sunscreen that the brand sells for  isnt going to be fake. Counterfeiters cant replicate those while still making a profit.,SkincareAddiction,d9f41z8,1,t5_2tbbg

9488662,0,t3_5alsuv,I think you just need to deal with the tight feeling until the medication course is done. When I finished Accutane my oils came back even though the acne didnt. I think you need to keep using the foaming cleanser if youre going to keep using vaseline though tbh I dont think you should be using vaseline while youre on a medication thats sloughing your skin off. Your bumps might be from the vaseline not allowing your skin to exfoliate itself.,SkincareAddiction,d9ioig1,1,t5_2tbbg
9490817,0,t3_5aqnk6,Theyll all work in pretty much the same way. Look for something with hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate in the top of the ingredient list. Make sure you are using an occlusive over top of it since it is a humectant.

I had just started taking niacinamide supplements as I read that they could also be a cure for depression I wanted to phase out my SSRIs. I started the veganish diet about the same time I took the before picture  I realized I needed to take action to feel better. I still eat meat but way less than before and no processed foods.Apparently there is an oral acne drug in the US that contains  mg Niacin so I just slowly increased my OTC supplements until I reached  mg. No adverse effects  no flushing! I saw definite improvement on my CCs after a week of BHA and the remaining went away with the increased dose of Niacin  snail cream I think.

So if youre still using moisturizer afterward it may be too much since argan oil is already so moisturizing.Edit Also it could be helpful to use it once a day instead of twice. I just use it at night since it takes longer to soak into the skin.,SkincareAddiction,da21o88,1,t5_2tbbg
9647064,0,t3_5d4nuy,Youre on track for thinking that vitamin C would be good and for something thats going to be going close to around your eye make sure that its an under eye product. Otherwise the formula could be very irritating for your eyeball if it gets in. Vit C aside a lot of people will argue that you dont need an eye cream specifically and that you can use just about any face product as some eye creams are repackaged face products. I personally use the Aquaphor Healing Ointment under my eye as its very gentle but also super hydrating.,SkincareAddiction,da278em,2,t5_2tbbg

9660583,0,t3_5dd1yt,AHAs are water soluble and BHAs are oil soluble. Why not consider using both acids instead because I dont think theres currently any other type of exfoliant. I only know two other exfoliants. Theres not a lot of studies on their efficacy although Ive tried them both and I think the PHA helped a bit and neither one fits your criterion as well. PHAs including lactobionic acid are water soluble and since theyre sugar acids their molecular size is fairly large as well.  LHAs are another type but its sort of similar to salicylic acid so it is also quite large. But I dont think the molecular size has to do anything with how it fits into pores really. The fact that something like BHA is oilsoluble allows it be able to penetrate pores. Hopefully that helps!,SkincareAddiction,da3vasz,1,t5_2tbbg

9696569,0,t3_5dyuxq,I never had bad acne growing up or in high school but around my sophomore year of college my face seemed to explode with acne. About a year ago I asked my GP some questions about my acne expressing my concerns and she basically wrote me off by telling me its because I dont wash my makeup off at night and that all I need is to change my routine to make it go away. So I sort of let that fester for a year before seeing a dermatologist two months ago. Seeing a dermatologist who validated my concerns and told me that my acne is not my fault nearly had me in tears and he made me feel really excited to get my skin cleared up. The first three selfies are the night before I saw the dermatologist and the last three are pictures I took this morning. Ive had three chemical peels in the last two months so there are a few pictures detailing my chemical peel experience PProducts Ive been using recommended by my derm and how Ive been using themSpironolactone mg dailyAMLira Sal Ice Cleanser  salicylic acid daily with a Clarisonic x a week clindamycin topical solutionSkinMedica AHABHA creamPMLira Sal Ice CleanserSkinMedica Retinol Complex started at . but Ive recently been bumped up to .SkinMedica AHABHA cream,SkincareAddiction,da8b3ny,69,t5_2tbbg

I also want to recommend a product to you. Its called Noxzema. I felt like everything over stripped my skin until I found this product. It cleans REALLY WELL without over stripping. Of course you will need to follow up with a moisturizer though. Maybe you can try vaseline? After you moisturize your skin you could apply a THIN layer of the stuff to whatever your driest area is. Just use a cotton swab to apply the vaseline because using your fingers will contaminate the Vaseline. Best wishes! ,SkincareAddiction,dahoiad,3,t5_2tbbg

You need to go to a dermatologist if you want this fixed because only prescriptions can stop this now. As stated by someone else curology is also available in the US. I agree with all of this.

9898939,0,t3_5h5w5h,The hydrating serum is massively overpriced and you can generally find something that does effectively the same thing for much less money i used to use it but now I use products from Deciems The Ordinary line. Plus yes you would still need a creamocclusive on top of that unless you live in a very humid climate because otherwise the humectants can draw moisture out of your skin. Ive heard good things about the Ultra Repair Moisturizer but I cant use it because I react poorly to shea butter which is in a lot of their stuff.Hard water is usually highpH so you might be showing signs of a damaged moisture barrier. You might want to try using a pHbalancing toner after you oil cleanse rather than using micellar water which often should be rinsed after anyway. The FAB Radiance Pads are a very mild chemical exfoliant that could probably be used to adjust the pH of your skin though there are probably less expensive options. And you might want to consider using a moisturizer with ceramides in it the FAB moisturizer you asked about has ceramide.,SkincareAddiction,daxusai,2,t5_2tbbg

9917243,0,t1_dazyi09,Id drop all sunscreen entirely for about two weeks to see if things improve  meaning just bare minimum routine  cleanser and moisturizer. Sunscreen is super important but youll never get to the bottom of exactly what product is breaking you out if your acne is product related until you do process of elimination  I mean realistically if youre inside the majority of the day anyway  though yes ideally youd have sunscreen your face wont catch on fire and melt offexplode from only two weeks without it lt Think about it  I know you said you had some new breakouts and PIH and dont want them to get worse but what if the sunscreen is causing the breakouts in the first place!?

9941886,0,t3_5hrsch,My skin responds really well to a diy face mist made up of about   glycerine you can get this at any drug store and  water. Glycerine is one of the most common ingredients in moisturisers. I dont use any preservatives in this so I only make a really small amount at a time to avoid bacteria growing. I would definitely recommend trying this and then topping it off with a few drops of a facial oil such as rosehip oil. And add night maybe top this off with some Vaseline.

10067734,0,t3_5jxwxd,What works for me is putting lip balm I really like burts bees pomegranate one but it is tinted so if youre a boy maybe not that one on then I use Lushs sugar scrub GENTLY scrub off as much yucky skin as I can then wipe off. If they still feel chapped Ill do another scrub then put a TON of balm on like way too much and let it soak in for a bit. And I keep chapstick or something around as much as possible and reapply very often. The scrub gets the skin off without picking and the balm should help restore them. You can also use a medium soft tooth brush and wet it and very very gently brush your lips to help get some dead skin off. But basically just exfoliate and keep them moisturized.I dont personally like vasoline its just a texture thing for me but the other posters are right that would help.

All in all  it has to feel good for you. Now  I am just a self taught stranger from the internet so I could always be wrong.

We tend to overlook just how big an impact stress and anxiety can have on our quality of life but really stress management is one of the best things you can do for yourself.Every person approaches it differently but I would recommend checking out rmeditation. Ive been actively trying to be more mindful and meditating a little bit each day  sometimes just a minute or two!  and Ive really noticed a difference in not only my skin quality but my overall health and mental wellbeing. I can handle big events like finals last semester and I took  credit hours! life changes big breakup and reconciliation and general anxiety in a much greater capacity than before I started meditating. And let me tell you it gets easier the longer you do it.I know it can be discouraging when your body image isnt how you want it to be but youre beautiful inside and out give this a shot and theres a chance your acne will not only start to clear up but also become less of a priority to you.

10421466,0,t3_5p83hf,Fellow rosacean  I second the Paulas Choice and Cosrx recs! The redness relief serum from PC is holy grail for me for sure and the Cosrx BHA helped me a ton with acne I had similar issues with Curology and it just decimated my skin but the Cosrx BHA feels moisturizing doesnt exacerbate my dry patches and has helped immensely with acne. ,SkincareAddiction,dcpcbyf,3,t5_2tbbg
10421773,0,t3_5p5r0q,Coconut oil. If your scalp is dry it will moisturize it and if its a result of a fungalbacterial infection the antimicrobial properties will help get rid of it. You can use it like a mask before you wash your hair. Get about  cup and melt in the microwave for a few seconds and put it all over your hair focusing on your scalp. Put your hair up in a shower cap and leave it on for at least a half hour but it wont hurt if you keep it on for longer. When youre ready to shower rinse your hair with  cup of unfiltered apple cider vinegar and   cups of water and wash and condition your hair normally. I do this for my hair every few weeks just to moisturize and clarify my hair and its amazing. I definitely think this routine would help if you did it a few days in a row to get rid of the dermatitis or infection. Just be warned you may have to wash your hair twice or do an extra rinse of the apple cider vinegarwater to get all of the coconut oil residue out of your hair so it doesnt look greasy. I also recommend washing your bedding at least every week and if you can change your pillow case every  days. Make sure you either get new hair brushescombs or sanitize them and any other hair tools you use. ,SkincareAddiction,dcpdl5a,2,t5_2tbbg

10429981,0,t1_dcptmk7,AHAs can cause a purge when you first start using them actives are the only ingredients that can cause purging AHAsBHAsRetinoidsRetinols  the best thing to ever do when introducing something is to patch test and introduce them one at a time! when i first apply products i only do so on one side of my face on one cheek for a few days to see if therell be any reaction. its easier to deal with breakouts in a smaller area than all over your face. the DE serum isnt just AHA its BHA as well it has salicylic acid!  if you want both of those ingredients in one serum peter thomas roth has a BHAAHA acne gel. biore is super popular! the only reason i gave it a go is because everyone in this sub and in rasianbeauty kept mentioning it! speaking of asian beauty cosrx also have BHA and AHA gels which are some of the more gentle formulations out there its  glycolic acid. also pretty cheap if you buy through jolse! free shipping tooyou can definitely switch out your toner for the pixi water its  so people do see a difference with scars and texture. its gentle enough to use daily. the thing with AHAs is you sorta do wanna wear a sunscreen no matter what  it is because the sun can darken your scarring so its going to reverse what the AHA is doing. sorry this is so long haha,SkincareAddiction,dcqb2rk,1,t5_2tbbg

10459207,0,t3_5pm5sd,Hi! Looking for a foaming cleanser to replace CeraVe Hydrating. Posted on rAsianBeauty here please take a look if youd like.Basically my skin has gone from totally dehydrated to my midtwenties combo since I started doing a double cleanse and following AB practices more or less. While CeraVe Hydrating was great before Id like to find something that cleanses more thoroughly nowpreferably foaming especially heading into summer. BUT my skin does still react to SD alcohol SLS etc. read turn tomato red. It isnt terribly bad with acids though at least long term.Given my success with CeraVe overall I was thinking about the Foaming cleanser but offput by its SLS the SA which sounds great but appears to have ppl with sensitive skin totally split on whether it helps or hurts or maybe the Baby Wash which has been said to be in some places something of a mix between the foaming and the hydrating. Thought Id post here because Im broke and personally feel that cleansers should be a cheap item in your beauty bagCeraVerange price is perfect and Im in the US probably better suggestions here for an alternative.Heres my basic criteriaFoaminggel or otherwise wellcleansing to follow up on an oil cleanserNonirritating oily t normal everywhere else but sensitivepH of . or lowerCheap endlike drugstore range.  or less for something big  oz. or so.  or less on sale like CeraVe online would be ideal.I did go through the wiki and saw the Simple product listed for the UK however I googled Simple Foaming Cleanser and they do have one that is reformulated and looks great ingredientswise on COSDna and pretty good in terms of user reviews other than some crappy ones on MUA but sometimes those are hit or miss in terms of skincare IMO. BUT it is infuriating that a line that claims to be simple wouldnt give you an exact pHthe site just says all of our products are pHbalanced. I emailed them but well see what comes of it since I havent found anything anywhere with a post of the exact pH Im assuming that others havent gotten a satisfactory response.So does anyone have any opinionstry the CeraVe SA the Baby Wash is it foaming? or does it cleanse better than the Hydrating or other recs for good products?Thank you very much!,SkincareAddiction,dctnngl,1,t5_2tbbg

After a shower andor stridex Ill use a sterile lance like the finger prickers in the diabetic care section then squeeze or pull the area gently with clean tissues on my fingers then clean it up and put a hydrocolloid bandage on it.

Yes I said open wound thats what that is. The yellow crust is basically... puss. Regardless if you take meds use some antibacterial ointment like polysporin or any with  active products in it and keep it moist apply as often as needed. It will prevent the dead bacterias from forming a crust of puss. and it will heal faster.The virus will not go away just go in dormant state and might bloom again later when your immune system is down for some reason sun seasont change flu etc,SkincareAddiction,dd20vzx,1,t5_2tbbg

10645891,0,t3_5sc1r1,I find that my face is burning when I moisturize after I exfoliate. I only exfoliate at night after cleansing with Neutrogena Cleansing Oil. I am using Yes to Tomatoes acne wipes which arent branded as an exfoliant but I thought they were one because they have . saylicyclic acid and thats the BPA exfoliant right? I follow with neutrogena oilfree moisturizer with SPF  I know I need spf  for daytime but it was  dollars more and I was on a tight budget. Its on the list and CeraVe in the Tub underaround my eye area for extra moisture. I have oily but not overly acneprone skin and I found that the CeraVe made my skin super oily if I put it all over my face even if I only used it at night.Ive only been using this routine for about a week and I added the wipes about  days ago. This is the newest product Ive introduced. At first it wasnt that bad  mostly spots around my eyes which I attributed to dryness from rubbing them allergies. Ugh. Now its practically my whole face. Again I only exfoliate at night but I cleanse and moisturize every morning. Maybe exfoliating every other day would do the trick? It didnt burn like this until tonight. Have I been over exfoliating?Or is my face burning because of a high saylicyclic acid content? The suggested Stridex pads are  and these are only . Should I try something less strong like .? Or could it be another ingredient in the wipes I use? Are they even exfoliating at all? Are there more acnefighting ingredients in them that could cause the burning?I know that when my hands were dry and cracked it burned to put any moisturizer on them besides Aquaphor and of course that wont work on my face. Im guessing that the wipes are making my skin too dry. Should I wait a little bit before I moisturize? I usually let the wetness from the wipes dry a minute before I move on to moisturizer. I am in the US and have access to Walmart Target and an Ulta with a pretty piddly skincare selection. However I will be home in a few weeks with access to an Ulta with a larger selection as well as a JCPenney Sephora but I would prefer to keep any product suggestions around  dollars maximum please!,SkincareAddiction,dde1iqg,2,t5_2tbbg

10791457,0,t1_ddt1awa,No it should clear with antibiotic ointment  try bacitracin specifically. But if you shave again with a razor too soon it can reoccur. They suggest not shaving infected areas for three months. Women get it on their legs all the time from hair removal and men in their beards. Its just the recommended treatment. If it doesnt respond to not shaving and the bacitracin then hit the doctor. It should start responding in  days with three applications of the ointment a day. ,SkincareAddiction,ddt29gz,1,t5_2tbbg

10801011,0,t3_5uh8cv,I have the same problem Im F. Ive also cleared up my cystic acne but still have large pores and oily skin. This has been going on since puberty. I believe that hormones play a role such as too much DHT. If you have fine or thinning hair or facial hair it could be too much DHT which is a cause of oily skin. In my case having a mirena IUD doesnt help either but Id rather have oily skin than an unplanned pregnancy.At this point in my life Ive tried a lot of different methods oil cleansing dietary changes moisturizing more etc and I think its just something I have to live with. Oily skin ages better anyway. I use oil free spf and Rimmel stay matte powder and of course frequent use of blotting papers. It does not eliminate the oil like you I blot throughout the day. You can use a primer to fill in large pores but I dont care that my pores are visible. Check out this website for some more info on oily skin. Im sure youll get a lot of responses about try moisturizing more your skin is dehydrated and producing more oil to compensate but that has been very untrue for me. I drink a lot of water and feel my skin is not dehydrated.,SkincareAddiction,ddu1q8e,1,t5_2tbbg

10812748,0,t1_dduhuiz,It depends on how persistent your marks or scars are.  There are all sorts of natural acids Mandelic Kojic etc.  that will accelerate the fading of acne marks.   For more persistent marks or actual scarring though the best solution is to include a product that contains both nicacinamide and gluosamine in your evening routine.   That can be a moisturizer like Olays Luminous Tone Perfecting Moisturizer or a serum like Shark Sauce or Paulas Choice Niacinamide Booster These products all reflect the most up to date research which has shown that the combination of the two ingredients is the most effective way to fade dark spots.  ,SkincareAddiction,ddv9bpe,1,t5_2tbbg

10852012,0,t1_ddzapau,Just as a heads up the Paulas Choice Resist SPF one is tinted but the Calm SPF is untinted so pick what you prefer  I use tretinoin at night and find the SPF to be perfectly adequate protection in the UK  our UV index rarely even goes above  most of the year so the WHO would say we dont even need to be wearing sunscreen most of the time. If Im out all day in the sun in the summer I will be using a totally different sunscreen anyway with a crazy white cast but for everyday wear I think the SPF is perfect.

Be aware when looking for stuff like this because a lot of brands market themselves as being organic or natural but have a ton of alcohols and drying ingredients in them. Also if you are concerned about the animal rights side of things check to make sure companies are really cruelty free. Many brands market things as vegan and then turn around and do animal testing.

11074214,0,t3_5y4pna,If hyperpigmentation is your problem Vitamin C is not really the solution to begin with.   Its true that Vitamin C is a mild tyronaise inhibitor but fading is really just a side benefit of its role in protecting against sun damage and no one should be using it primarily for fading.  Also LAscorbic Acid is not necessarily the best formulation.  As you have discovered it can be very irritating for some people and besides other formulations have been found to be more effective with certain skin concerns such as acne and mild marks.In any case you should focus on products that are actually targeted at fading.   You could start with some of the acids such as kojac or azelaic mentioned in the sidebar.   For persistent marks though you probably want try something with stronger tyrosinase inhibition ... ie. you want to decrease the production of melanin and fade what is there.   There has been a fair amount of recent research about what really helps in doing that.  Most of the results show that a combinations of known inhibitors work much better.  One good solution is to include a product that combines niacinamide and gluosamine in your evening routine.   That can be a moisturizer like Olays Luminous Tone Perfecting Moisturizer or a serum like Shark Sauce or Paulas Choice Niacinamide Booster These products all reflect the most up to date research which has shown a that niacinamide can be as effective as hydroquinone in fading scars without the negative effects and b that combining niacinamide and glucosamine both of which are more effective than acids commonly referenced packs an extra punch for fading dark spots.,SkincareAddiction,den936r,4,t5_2tbbg

11082244,0,t3_5xr748,Hello all! I have been trying to amp up my skincare game a ton within the past year however I have some issues that are not changing so I think I might be missing something or not using the right products for my skin type. Im  and have had dry skin my whole life. I get hormonal breakouts on my chin and every once in a while the occasional small blemish elsewhere and have acne scars on my chin from old blemishes which are just not going away. My dry skin isnt getting better and I dont know what else to do  its particularly bad on my nose and sometimes on my chin. My nose is always flaky no matter how often I exfoliate I cant wear any makeup on it at all it just accentuates the flakes and Ive even started carrying moisturizer with me so that I can reapply throughout the day just to my nose. My AMPM routine is as followsAM Rinse Face with water every other day cleanse with Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser.Spray with Glossier Rose Water Face Mist.Moisturize first with Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil.Layer Dr. Jart Ceramidine Cream on top of oil.PMRemove Makeup with Garnier Micellar Water.Wash face with Glossier Milky Jelly OR Pacifica Glow Baby Youthful Face Scrub alternate days or every  days.Apply Mizon Hyaluronic Acid this is a new step added within the past  months.Sunday Rileys Juno Face Oil.Mix Fresh Seaberry Face Oil in with belif The True Cream Moisture Bomb.I purchased a duo kit of Sunday Rileys Good Genes Lactic Acid and Luna Retinol ester I believe? but I wasnt totally sure how to incorporate them into my routine and if thats even what I was needing. Id love some input and other suggestions if Im doing everything completely wrong. I want to tackle the flaky skin issue first but would eventually like to start figuring out how to get rid of the hyperpigmentation on my chin from acne scars as well. Also  I live in Minnesota which definitely doesnt help with having dry skin. Skin is extra bad in the winter but I have issues all year round even during humid summers.

11098225,0,t3_5xr748,Something in my routine is making makeup not look right on my skin. I think its the sunscreen but Im not sure. In the morning I use Neutrogena ultra gentle cleanser followed by  drops of argan oil as a moisturiser then La Roche Posay Anthelios xlSPF  ultralight. I wear make up mostly every day and Ive been noticing since I started using the sunscreen religiously that my foundation and concealer just does not look right. It looks like I have flaky dry patches on my cheekbones and chin in particular and it pills really badly. I cant get it to look properly blended no matter what.Ive been using Smashbox photo finish pore minimizing primer under Kat von D lockit foundation thats mixed with lightening drops from the Body Shop. The primer made the pilling and flakiness super bad so I switched to a cheap Rimmel primer that has actually performed better. I thought it might have been a case of not waiting until each layer was dry before applying but I did the routine and applied make up on a day when I had a lot of time to let each layer soak in and it didnt seem to really do anything. Is it a case of layering the silicone primer over the sunscreen? Is there a better alternative SPF? Im really frustrated here because no amount of frantic blending with a damp beauty blender seems to be helping. ,SkincareAddiction,depz2wx,3,t5_2tbbg

11115006,0,t3_5yowp5,I have combination skin so I can relate!I would suggest getting a simple skin care routine example . Gently cleanse . Tone . Moisturizerspfacne treatments.Some cleansers that are good are cetaphil Ive tried this and hated it it made my face so oily and the one I like a lot and use personally is Cerave Hydrating cleanser it has ceramides and hyaluronic acid to help repair skins natural barrier. A toner Id recommend would be Thayers Witch Hazel its alcohol free. A toner is a topical astringent that helps cleanse moisturize and restore skins ph balance. Now I would recommend you try a gel moisturizer for the day or try and find a light weight spf you like. I use to use Clean and Clear Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer it does have fragrance which can be irritating to skin. A spf you could try would be the Olay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer spf  sensitive skin its light weight and doesnt make my face super greasy. Spf is essential for preventing any acne scars from getting worse and obviously help prevent sun damage. At night you may need a better moisturizer I use some things from Andalou naturals and like them a lot but theyre about  dollars from Amazon so that may be out of your budget. You can try the gel at first for night time use and if you dont like it you can try and find something else. For acne treatments I recommend you try salicylic acid daily. So I recommend you try  daily at night and before you apply your moisturizer. If thats not strong enough you can try . Yes to tomatoes has a good skin repair treatment I use to use a lot. Salicylic acid will help with blackheads and redness. For cystic acne you can try adding a Benzoyl peroxide cream  and use that all over the face once or twice a week if that doesnt work you can try a sulfur mask. That helped with my cystic acne. Acne free has one. I would only use the sulfur masks once or twice a week.I dont really use this anymore Ive started using differin gel for my only acne treatment. Differin gel is the only thing thats worked for my cystic acne. Ive tried OCM salicylic acid BP antibiotics nothing worked. Remember to treat skin gently and dont overkill it with various strengths of acne medication. You may have purging when you start a new routine this is normal and can last a few weeks. Everyones skin is different so these may or may not work for you. Some links to the products. Good luck!,SkincareAddiction,dervkjy,1,t5_2tbbg

11194878,0,t3_5zqgh8,Hi! So this may be an odd suggestion but maybe try the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence sunscreen. Its an Asian Beauty product but it is seriously fantastic. The reason I think it can help here is that its got quite a high alcohol content giving it a great mattifying effect. If you know alcohol is not an irritant for you maybe try it out! Heres a review. I bought a two pack off eBay the other day and it came in less than a week.Also not sure if your doctorderm went over this with you but its very very important to be using sunscreen with Differin! Its a retinoid and while they are wonderfully effective for treating acne they are also photosensitizing. This means youre more susceptible to sunburn and photoaging. I used Differin when I was younger and ignored the sunscreen advice and have also used other photosensitizing ingredients over the years without sun protection. I dont think Im significantly photoaged so no need to worry about it until you find a sunscreen you likejust something very important to be aware of. So the Biore may tick both boxes for you  If you decide to try it out as always make sure you patch test first.Hope this helps!,SkincareAddiction,df0xci7,1,t5_2tbbg

11211230,0,t3_5z313g,Hi! Thank you for your guys time! I have really struggled with my skin so this thread is super helpful for me.The issue I need help with  Acne. I have a lot of bumps which Im guessing are blackheads on my chin especially. And scattered pimples here or there usually on my forehead my cheeks. My goal would to be have clearer smoother skin. PSA I also wear a lot of face makeup to deal with my acne and cover it and I know this is a vicious cycle but wearing makeup for me is pretty non negotiable so I want to find a routine that works well for someone who wears a lot of makeup  Skin type Oily acne prone.Current RoutineAM I use CeraVe SA Cleanser Formula .. Toner PM CeraVe SA Cleanser Formula .. Toner Coconut Oil for my eye makeup. I also usually put on a mask at night like almost every night. Various masks but usually use that super popular Pure Body Naturals Dead Sea Mud Mask on Amazon and similar masks. Nothing too harsh though. At least not to my knowledge!Occasionally use Exfoliator  the new St Ives Oil Exfoliator which I use  times a week.

Because after it oxidizes isnt it then a prooxidant...which would negate the use of VitC for its antioxidant function  amp accelerate what youre trying to prevent?

I avoid fragrance synthetic dyes and menthol or other cooling ingredients.Other bells and whistles  niacinamide antioxidants etc. are great but the most important things a moisturizer does is draw water in humectants and help reinforce your skins lipid barrier emollients.People have had luck using Ceraves facial lotion PM it has glycerin hyaluronic acid cholesterol ceramides and niacinamide. I use the AM SPF  and its been great for my skin. Best part is you can find Cerave at most drugstores and its very affordable. You might have a different experience because heaven knows what ingredient might piss off your skin but Ceraves is a good starting point. Keep your receipt and patch test a small swipe on one of your cheeks each night for a couple weeks. No reaction? Yay! Youve found a great product that works for you. Bad reaction? Boo! But at least you can return it for full refund at most stores if not contact the maker and the damage is limited. I hope this helps!,SkincareAddiction,dfd9pnh,1,t5_2tbbg

11312551,0,t1_dfdk2je,I do a similar thing! I mist my face with a toner prior to applying the Vit C and it definitely helps. The vit c is essentially in undissolved crystals in the serum since its waterless with the point being that the moisture on your skin will eventually dissolve them itself  I find misting before and a bit after application to be really effective which I judge by the fact that my skin gets the tingles a second time around when I mist on top of the serum. ,SkincareAddiction,dfe9dax,2,t5_2tbbg

11316110,0,t3_61hncn,Your cleanser and the exfoliate might be too irritating for your skin and alcohol is very drying which is probably why its creating extra blemishes. I have really similar skin woes as you and I find that using a gentle cleanser and exfoliator like a silicone brush or a konjac sponge does the job just fine in the cleansing department.

11332650,0,t3_61qiyj,Extra InformationOnce my skin was getting dry from the acne topical treatment Acnefree  BP was using it too much because I got impatient about x a week but dropped it back down to x x if acne is super stubborn. Been using it for over a year though and it never made my skin this dry. Plus that was months ago when I was over using it. I only used it twice in the past month now My skincare routine PanOxyl Daily Control  x a dayDerma E Scar Gel x a day No Youthful Eye Serum x a daySoap amp Glory in Day Lotion SampG Beauty Sleep Accelerator at Night Been switching between Burts Bees Intense Hydration Eye Lotion amp SampGs Puffy Eye Attack within the last  weeks for extra moisturization for my eyes when they have started to get dry but they havent worked. I have used the Burts Bees in the past and it fixed my eye dryness. SampGs Puffy Eye Attack is semi new but I use it on multiple parts of my face and the leftover on my hands and they arent dry like my eyes. It works well on my hands but not my face. I stopped using the eye serum once my eyes started to get flakey as it made them burn. I have been using it for almost two years so it is not the culprit. I used to use Witch Hazel but dropped it as soon as my skin got drier as I know it can be drying havent used it in anytime recently though.  ,SkincareAddiction,dfgjbnj,2,t5_2tbbg

11368259,0,t3_6210fl,. No Clean and Clear or St. Ives. Exfoliate maximum  times a week. ALWAYS WEAR SPF. Never have a cleanser with sulfates or soap bases like sodium tallowate or sodium palm kernalate. Double cleanse my child even if you dont wear makeup. Even if you stick to a brand like SKII for over    years dont expect to have plastic surgery like result and dont expect to be young forever the most magical of products can only slow down time not stop it. And there is no such thing as turning back the clock people are mistaking that for dewy skin and confidence.. Try some novelty products maybe theyll end up in your routine.. DIY your stuff. Its not that hard to DIY things so you wont have to buy from the drugstore all the time. ik some diys are hard but like how hard is it to mix sugar with your cleanser to make a scrub how hard is it to mix Aveeno lotion and yogurt to make a moisturizer?l. Research before you splurge. Watch reviews on YouTube if you watch enougb you know which person is sponsored and avoid those. Dont stress over it. Ye you could do a  or even  step routine idc but dont do this to look better for anyone and dont pick at every single flaw in the mirror because some people dont got teeth and you better feel blessed for having tiny dark spots nobody will see.,SkincareAddiction,dfkkjbx,1,t5_2tbbg

Research has proved that witch hazel is a skin irritant. Irritants cause damage to the skin both initially and over time. Astringents in general are not recommended due to stripping skin too severely. If you are concerned about oily skin its best to use mild products. Astringents and harsh cleansers due to removing too much sebum causes the skin to overproduce oil to compensate for what is lost. Please learn from my mistake and use mild products. Excess oil should regulate after that.     ,SkincareAddiction,dfscvp5,1,t5_2tbbg

11502397,0,t3_634hma,Ive posted before but new day new questions!The issue I have very bad PIH and acne scars Im currently on a retinoid and would like to implement an exfoliant but am not sure which one to get. Skin type Oily prone to break outs.Current routineMorningHenriette Faroche Cleansing FoamBenzon Snail and Bee essenceHenriette Faroche matte moisturizerEveningHenriette Faroche Cleansing FoamHenriette Faroche matte moisturizerEvery two days I put on a . Vit A retinoid in the evening.Ive been using the VitA for almost  weeks now and so far Im happy with it I also have the dryness under controle and everything is going fine.Im quite happy with my skin lately because Ive had way less pimples than normal so my acne is very nicely under control. However I have a lot of PIH and scarring left from older pimples. I would like to speed up this healing process by implementing an exfoliant into my routine. Ive used PCs Clear Extra Strength  BHA for two weeks and was quite happy with the product but since its fairly expensive I was wondering if there might be a better choice. I read that an AHA is maybe even better for my problems. But since I have oily skin this might not be my best choice. I was also considering Corsx BHA Blackhead Powerliquid. Anybody experience with these andor has the same problem? ,SkincareAddiction,dfzsoz8,1,t5_2tbbg

11505284,0,t3_5w4o0g,Regarding the Coola Matte Im reluctant to use it because rosehip seed oil makes my skin more sun sensitive in my experience and research  Ive done on it supports my suspicions. I dont get why skincare companies add ingredients that might even possibly heighten sun sensitivity to sunscreen! Ive bad the same issue with PCs Resist and I suspect its the willow bark. I had the same problem with another sunscreen with willow bark and another that had citrus extracts and oils. Its truly flabbergasting and extremely frustrating because otherwise these would be HG products for me and its been extremely hard finding a ss I like enough for daily use.

11523563,0,t1_dg0otyj,So it worked out pretty well I still use them!I should mention that I did end up going on low dose Accutane Epuris. The main reason for this was that the acne started to spread down my shoulders and my back. Topical treatments were a bit difficult. However I was able to manage the acne on my face pretty well with a combination of RetinA and Epiduo. I actually still use both occasionally on my face even though I am still on accutane. Theyve been helping with the scars. I had a lot of close comedones as well as large painful pimples.A few tips that helped me. Wait AT LEAST  minutes after washing your face and applying your lotion before you put the EpiduoRetin A on. . AVOID your mouth area. Seriously...avoid it. Or else you will have a flaking disgusting mess. Take it slow. These creams may not seem like that are doing much or irritating your skin the first night you apply them. But three days later when your face is red burning and flaking off you will greatly regret loading your face with them.. With RetinA I put a pea size drop on the back of my hand. Then I spread all over my face. The reason why I put it on the back of my hand is that it helps me maintain the amount that I am putting on my face. You never want to be putting more than a pea drop of cream on. It will not speed up the process it will just irritate your skin more.. With Epiduo I only put it on my active spots. So I will use a qtip to put it on my big active spots. I do not spread it around my entire face. It is far too irritating and doesnt benefit you in anyway. . Lets say one night you go to put your lotion on and you feel a burning feeling. Just skip the EpiduoRetina that night. Everyones skin reacts different. Make sure you pay attention to how the Epiduo is working out because sometimes people can be allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide. It will take at least  weeks for you to see results. You may see results with the Epiduo faster. But the RetinA will take some time. Dont give up hope!. Epiduo can bleach clothes bed sheets towels etc. I didnt have any sort of issue with it. But I know the derm and the pharmacist will warn you about this.. SUNSCREEN...SUNSCREEN....SUNSCREEN!Let me know if you need anymore help!,SkincareAddiction,dg274py,1,t5_2tbbg

11598139,0,t3_65inpj,Two step only is a really tall order and although Im not that far away from you in air miles Im unaware of what might be available at a Shoppers in New Brunswick.  If she can get La Roche Posay I think their sunscreen formulations are better than average and I know they make some moisturizers that are SPF  e.g. Hydraphase UV and maybe one in their Toleriane line.  Simple has good cleansers including micellar water but I dont think they have a moisturizer above SPF . I think that is also true of Garnier. Bioderma also makes some good products again micellar water but to the best of my knowledge no moisturizer with SPF.  Neutrogena might be an option I know they have moisturizers rated SPF  and above but they dont use newer more stable sunscreen ingredients like the Mexoryl in the LRP products.Good luck she is just going to have to try a few things to see what works for her.

11623532,0,t1_dgdh4td,I am currently on the hunt for a decent cleanser as well. Ive heard good things about camellia oil. Im going to pick up a bottle of  cold pressed soon and see where that takes me. My current cleanser is Skyn Icelands Glacial Face Wash but a lot of the ingredients are red flags for me. That being said for some reason it really works with my acne. Ive dropped down to using it every other day or as needed and using grapeseed oil in between.My favorite toner is Diors Gentle Toning Lotion. Its incredibly moisturizing and alcohol free. However it does contain fragrance so if youre trying to be as kind to your skin as possible I cannot in good conscious recommend it. You could always try a bottle of organic rose water as a dupe for it. Rosewaters gentle hydrating effects on the skin are well documented and should mimic the peony water formula of Diors product.Instead of moisturizer I use Lululuns Balance Moisture sheet mask again every other day or as needed. These masks are loaded up with hyaluronic acid and very plumping for my skin. And then I finish off with a light layer of  cold pressed apricot seed oil. I like a dewy glowy look so this has worked very well for me.As you can see I tend to lean more towards the natural skincare side of things. Most of my acne was caused by dryness and sensitivity to preservatives additives etc. in skin care products. Ive really pared it down and simplified what goes on my face by taking an ingredient driven approach and that has really worked for me. However to each his own. A good resource for product recommendations is Gothamista on youtube. I dont agree with a lot of her recommendations due to some of their additives but for someone less obsessive than me they could work. She is also a good beginners resource to delving deeper into the why stuff works aspect of skin care. I also love TophCam though his recommendations tend to be more high end and many contain essential oils and fragrance that again could be concerning if youre trying to eliminate any possible irritants.,SkincareAddiction,dgdjelt,2,t5_2tbbg

And you cant stay on them forever...so they always felt like a loselose situation for me. Im on spirinolactone now which balances your hormones. He also gave me a RX for Tazorac cream to use every other night and Aczone gel in the mornings. The Biore watery essence sunscreen is the most highly recommended one amongst acne sufferers I ordered one for myself as well but it hasnt come through the mail yet. Im currently shopping around for sunscreens so I dont have a good recommendation and just found my way into the Asian sunscreen market. The downside is the shipping can take forever depending on the seller and I happened to choose one from Japan. I got mine off of amazon. If you go to rAsianBeauty and search around they have a ton of threads about sunscreen and different recommendations. Im no dermatologist or esthetician but your skin also looks dehydrated which was why I asked about the water.  I suffered from oily skin my entire life so I was misled into thinking I needed to stay away from moisturizing lol and any hydrating products when in reality my skin was dehydrated and over producing sebum because of that...which in turn kept clogging my pores. I also drank a lot of water and still do but I guess my stubborn skin still wasnt pleased. After incorporating more moisture and hydration my skin looked so much better. I actually cant find a good cleanser to replace my tried and true Cetaphil daily cleanser. There is so much online about how apparently awful the ingredients are but out of every cleanser Ive tried it has worked the best for me. The PH on it is too high so I use a PH balancing toner afterwards to prepare my skin for actives. Asian toners are different than American ones because they balance your PH and prepare your skin for the rest of your routine instead of acting like a tough astringent. The one Im using currently is Klairs Hydrating Preparation Toner. I love it so far. Ive noticed for me personally using a basic cleanser without any fancy ingredients works best so I can incorporate those ingredients later in my routine when I need them. I look at my skin care products like a wardrobe you dont have to wear everything in your wardrobe everyday but its nice to have an umbrella and rain boots lying around your closet in case it storms. I use two different kinds of moisturizers. My daily morning and night one is the Clinique dramatically different gel. Its not that thick of a moisturizer my sister has acne prone skin that is drycombo and she loves the lotion version of that same moisturizer. The days that I use my RX retinol product I put on a sleeping mask as my last step to seal everything in and also help with the dreaded tret face. So far its working great for me for that purpose. Its the CosRx honey ultimate overnight mask. If your skin likes honey I love the Scinic Honey Ampoule. It has anti inflammatory properties makes my skin very soft and helps with the dry patches the acne medications can cause and it has niamicide which helps with discoloration. ,SkincareAddiction,dgenedw,5,t5_2tbbg

11636077,0,t3_65z0f7,Hey! I dont know this subreddit does it but every time I have a problem someone is coming up with very similar questions. Have you ever tried heat compresses on these spots? Im currently experimenting with hot compress vs cold compress. Ive always personally had more success in cold compress as it numbs the area stopping it from irritating me and ultimately popping and reduces swelling. However Hot compress has the increased blood flow healing factor.,SkincareAddiction,dgeync5,3,t5_2tbbg
11638357,0,t1_dgeit1i,Samesies. I tried Cerave and suddenly started breaking out in cystic acne on my cheeks. Never had horrible skin acne like that before. It took me a couple months to realize duh that it was the cerave. Its been six months since I stopped went back to my old face washing routine toner and moisturizer plus added jojoba oil. I still have slight pigmentation issues from where the cysts formed but one side is fully healed. So theres hope. A friend recently told me she stopped using all products and started using only a Norwex makeup cleaning cloth.

11648425,0,t1_dgfekeg,It depends for me... sometimes the pimplesit will go away obediently if I leave it alone and dont touch it. Other times it just keeps getting worse and builds up more pressure. At a certain point those kind of pimples wont go away unless I clean it out. I have to cleanse the surface of my face first and wash my hands thoroughly. I practically enable surgery protocols  Ill use a sterilized needle  to create a tiny and easily healed incision and apply light pressure with qtips dipped in hydrogen peroxide. Those pimples usually end up with a lot of pus coming out and deflating the pressure so it no longer hurts. I make sure to sanitize and never push beyond first sight of blood. Best if you can stop before blood. I sanitize the wound and apply a liquid bandage. Ive really tried just leaving those types alone but they just get worse and last way too long. Following the above procedure the pimple is no longer inflamed and just a redmark the next day and then the day after its already fading. This is probably not what youre supposed to do but honestly it works really well for me and only for very specific kinds of pimples. For all other circumstances I try not to aggravate spot treat leave them alone and maybe Ill put a liquid bandage over them at night to prevent dirt saliva etc from touching it overnight. ,SkincareAddiction,dggd2w4,9,t5_2tbbg

I know its hormonal and Ive been working with a gyno who assures me I need to give it more time. I respect that but I also dont feel comfortable doing nothing right now and I really want to at least do something to try and improve what Ive got going on for the time being.My skin was normal for the  years I was on the pill. Now it is SUPER oily and acneprone and I have no experience with how to handle that. Ive experimented a lot with the info on this sub but this week I stripped my routine back down to CeraVe foaming cleanser and CeraVe PM moisturizing lotion. I use that morning and night and I shower every morning if that helps. Id say by mid day my face is so oily that it takes  blotting sheets make me feel clean however Im trying to stop using them because somehow it feels like Im just making things worse. And I always have at least  active whiteheads on my cheekschin.I have stopped wearing makeup altogether and I wear my hair off of my face to try and help as well. I have already purchased a lot of products including Stridex vitamin C serum an AHA serum various moisturizers a BP gel masks... I know I incorporated all of them way too fast in a desperate attempt to help and it backfired.

A moisturiser is definitely recommended though but it may be a bit of a challenge to find the right one hypoallergenic doesnt mean it wont cause a reaction.Sunscreen is definitely important but I would say try to go for sun protection like wearing hats sunglasses UV protective clothing and the like.

If its one of the others you should be good and the exfoliant.  You also will probably want to get used to one again if its the Lascorbic acid should be ok if its one of the others before you start the other.  As for the VasAqu you can use it in place of a sleeping mask or over it.

11802600,0,t3_68eo5g,Hi there! It seems like you may be looking for some information on DermarollingDermastamping. Dermarolling can improve the appearance of atrophic scarring when done correctly. However there are several risks and Id like to warn you about them  You should not be doing this every day. When done inoffice treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart. Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color It hurts. You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best. The needles can become bent over time or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.Because of these risks ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home.
