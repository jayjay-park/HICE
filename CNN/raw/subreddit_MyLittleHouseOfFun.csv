2809777,0,t1_cnmrdkx,Originally Minna was planned to be a ticking time bomb. That means if she undeniably had been betrayed by someone she thought was her friend she would have snapped innerly and tried to unconsciously eliminate this threat. Paired with her good faith in others and that shes a bit slowwitted I thought that something really interesting would happen.Im still not sure I would have liked it if that had happened Im happy with this outcome. But it was sometimes a bit tedious roleplaying Minna she came off as a bit too weepy should have been little hysteric fits but that would have been even more annoying. Im amazed how Checklad did this in the former game... Whatever apart from Frederick and K. not so much happened from her perspective and she wasnt the character to bond with others so my information about the game were often limited to what I was told by Isa Avelyn and Frederick.Um Im complaining too much. Overall it was fun roleplaying Minna even though I got less from the actual game and its plotting and more from personal interactions with the few players Minna conversed.

6212408,0,t1_cyvfc1t,Emilia was first but Ive been toying with it for a long time hipster Anonymous players. Noone can immediately recognise the other player immediately unless they pay attention to their writing and even then if someones really good they can even fake that. Im not sure about others but I think people will always have a certain bias positive or negative against certain people.For me I always dread Ctoms characters even had they not been the technical opposite in some way like NedCheck and JasonDhahabu. His writing style and analytical skill is phenominal in my opinion and makes me really want to avoid PMing him as much as possible even if I know itll be great just because I know hell eat me alive.The second thing Ive been thinking about is Computers amp Codes everyone starts with a computer and needs to use those to gather information and communicate with other players. The common room is just a chatroom whilst the players themselves are basically trapped in their own seperate rooms. The nights are still free roaming not sure with a few rooms or just one big one but due to noone being able to recognise them attackingallyingactions become harder to plan for. Everything done on the computers however besides some basic functions require codes some which specify what they do others not so much. Along with that people can see which codes have been used but not their effect. Should I host one especially one that is divided over the weeks I think this mechanic will definitely make it in.Id still want to bring up banishment but since its not a new mechanic I suppose Ill save that one for a mechanicfocused thread for all games thus far.The third thing wouldve been Cards but they function the same as codes with computers as mentioned above. Everyone would be told when they were used but its effect wouldnt be known unless it affected the common room.
