79553,0,t3_1uz9cb,So many SkyRe builds. And surprisingly most of them have been lengthy playthroughs all to at least lvl  a few into the s Khajiit thief unarmed and bows long and short for ranged combat. Sneakarchery is basically what I naturally lean towards so this was my first build and my favorite but also overpowered once I perked out Sneak. Redguard pyromancershaman. Use fire destruction spellsillusionalteration and bound swords for close combat.  Breton vampire. Used Better Vampires mod and mostly relied on the spellsabilities it addshanded longsword duelist type. I actually really really ended up loving handed without a shield but its really only viable after reaching  in light weaponry and you can get the first rank in longswords. Nord stormcloakwerewolf. I never really liked the civil war quest line or companions but figured roleplaying my way through them would make it interesting. Character used handers preferably a Battle Axe heavy armor and a Broadswordheavy shield when blocking was a necessity. And of course werewolf form in case of emergencies. Current character RangerPaladinWitcher. Mostly a ranger type in the early game relying almost solely on short bows and light armor female character so for roleplaying purposes it didnt make sense to me that shed be strong enough to strut around in heavy armor brandishing shields or stringing a longbow. Restoration is the only school of magic she can use and is quite adept at using healing spells for herself and companions as well as throwing up offensive and defensive auras depending on the situation. Has sort of evolved into an antiundeadnecromancersmages with the acquisition of Dawnbreaker and skills in Enchanting that have capped out her elemental and magical resistances along with spell absorption from the Atronach stone which also saves me from needing to put points into Magicka instead of HealthStamina. Getting to be a jack of many trades at this point because of her levelset the uncapper to give too many perkslevel for a while but quite a fun build. Archery is a lot more fun when youre running around to avoid being hit and firing every time you get breathing room instead of shotting everything from half a mile away without them even noticing.Next character Im planning will be a Necromancer Dark Elf since I havent really dabbled much in SkyRe conjuration which looks very interesting. Not sure what other skills hell possess probably Illusion and Alteration since they were pretty fun and some kind of back up offense probably daggers. An assassinnecromancer hybrid actually makes surprising sense and promotes good synergy. But I need to finish my own mod for the roleplaybackstory first so itll probably be a while.,SkyRe,cenhhy7,3,t5_2zqb4
161355,0,t1_cewfxad,Why is that a problem? Dual Wield Parrying lets you block when using a spell.,SkyRe,cewt7u3,3,t5_2zqb4
