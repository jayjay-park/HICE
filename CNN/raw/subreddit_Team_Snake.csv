10308983,0,t1_dcc6e79,Thats great. I dont order pizza myself but if my boyfriend wants it I usually have some. Just a slice or  carefully looking at calories and its been fine. No need to give up on all the good stuff. Its good practise for eating a sensible amount ,Team_Snake,dcckurc,2,t5_3i6yk

10323862,0,t3_5nqjrq,This week has been pretty successful for me. Going to the gym regularly helps me so much to stay on track with my diet because I do not want all my hard work to be undone. Having accountability in the form of teammates is also very helpful. It has been brutally cold here as low as F wind chills so my steps have been very low. It is supposed to warm up next week so hopefully I will be able to be more active. ,Team_Snake,dce9m0n,2,t5_3i6yk

10326198,0,t3_5nq1fm,Not a recipe exactly but Im a meat eater and found that substituting ground turkey for ground beef is an easy way to make a change. Turkey is actually cheaper at least where I live and its better for you. Yet it tastes pretty much the same. ,Team_Snake,dcej5ry,1,t5_3i6yk

10391551,0,t3_5ot3rx,I admire your positivity! Its a really great trait to have. I really struggle with that tbh. Today I ate well but am tired and dont feel like exercising and Im beating myself up over it. I struggle with forcing myself to do stuff and with being okay with how things are. Kudos to you!,Team_Snake,dcly52e,2,t5_3i6yk
10392542,0,t1_dclqtnq,Is... cow squishing a large hazard for that job? I mean I imagine its much more of a hazard for that job than any other jobsave perhaps a farmer? cattle herder? but just... you got literally squished by a cow!,Team_Snake,dcm26y4,1,t5_3i6yk

10493559,0,t3_5q9gtq,NSV all of my current pants are looser on me. Im back to the point that I can feel my legs moving around inside my pants instead of my pants being stuck to my legs if that makes sense. After the  holiday season I had to start wearing these pants again after gaining back about  of the  lbs I had lost. Then I struggled all of  with trying to get back on track only to maintain never lose what I had regained. Then near the end of  I got into work challenges and rloseit challenges and my flip was switched back on. So Im back to losing and Im super excited about it. So I guess the realbonus NSV is Im in it to win it. This is happening. ,Team_Snake,dcxjznw,8,t5_3i6yk
