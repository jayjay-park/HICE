513620,0,t3_1zy7na,the only milk chocolate ive had that doesnt taste too oily or too sweet but is just creamy enough to melt in your mouth is Frey chocolate that my sisters godparents brought her from Switzerland. Frey doesnt export to the U.S. as far as ive been able to find. really annoys me because it was by far the best ive had ever. ,chocolate,cfynh0c,1,t5_2qhvm
