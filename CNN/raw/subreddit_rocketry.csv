171957,0,t3_1w24fo,You can look at how the development of large liquid rocket engines LREs has progressed over the last  years. One thing to look at would be LRE cycles. Look at how we started with gas generator cycles then fuelrich preburners rusisan oxrich preburners and full flow staged combustion cycles. As hobbified mentions the goal is to burn the propellants in a gaseous form for mixing purposes. Theres a large pressure dependence on thrust but all in all its not so much about generating more thrust its about producing thrust more efficiently. Youre asking a very fundamental question. You should start with some fundamental physics and figure out what is thrust. Start with Newtons second law. ,rocketry,cey0oc7,0,t5_2qhgi

There are lots of different electric based propulsion options from electric driven pumps for chemical rockets to resistojets arcjets ionplasma propulsion VASMIR...The limit for all electric propulsion is power generation mass vs thrust which limits them to low acceleration missions.  If power generation system mass were reduced by  orders of magnitude with your super batteries acceleration would increase exponentially.  At this point it becomes a matter of miniaturization.  Some things dont scale linearly but in general you can probably expect the size of the system to roughly follow battery mass.If you want me to do the work  provide links and hard numbers you might consider upvotes.,rocketry,cldrzwo,1,t5_2qhgi

Sizing the servos is a bit trickier. Once you have figured out your maximum speed and altitude I would suggest you see the applied force and torque to your fins given an max angle of X. Dynamic pressure is   density  velocity . You can look up lift and drag tables for a flat plate or calculate it yourself. That will ensure you can move your fin back into being straight or hold position at high angles of attack.I then suggest you put a high safety factor of the actuator torque xx more than you need.The maximum load on the fins will probably come when it lands under parachute and gets thumped by the ground.

8097836,0,t3_4q59aq,This is a PSA as discussed on this thread on TRF some of CTIs mm motors have been experiencing failures of the forward closure. The problem has been determined to be a bad batch of resin used to injection mold the forward closures leading to a bad bond between the closure assembly and the epoxy used to hold the delay grain in. This results in the forward closure failing almost instantly and exhaust escaping from both ends of the motor usually killing the rocket in the process.Theres a list in the PDF of dealers orders that were potentially affected by the bad resin. If you bought a mm CTI reload from one of those dealers you can get a replacement forward closure from one of the dealers.
