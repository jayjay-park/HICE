7887237,0,t1_d42jx8d,Its only in dreams that we find reality.Its only with fear that dreams are taken. Im lost in a dream. I cant grasp reality. Im split between two worlds. Dreams and reality. Ever battling each other over ownership of my brain. I am not lazy my mind is forever racing at a million miles an hour. I feel sleep grabbing hold and consuming me. Hope when I awake from my dream that I will be united with reality. Before the endless battle rages on. My brain wont stop working.This is what Ive written when in that state. I see similarities in what was said. I liked your story with illustrations its possible to tell the story. But as is it is it doesnt have much flow to it. Try to link the sections a bit better and descriptions help when talking about psychedelic experiences. ,writingfeedback,d42ljw3,1,t5_2w5w2
