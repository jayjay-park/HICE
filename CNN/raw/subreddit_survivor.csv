18442,0,t3_1u23jv,BvW actually and Ive seen every season. I think every season told a good story though. Vytass redemption and rivalry with his golden boy brother. Ultimately he forms an even stronger bond with his brother on the adventure. Cieras internal conflict regarding whether to stick with her mother or to vote her out in order to further her own game. They eventually talk it out and come to some sort of agreement. Still an emotional moment at tribalThe TysonMonicaGervase alliance seeking revenge for their loved ones whom were voted out early...and succeeding.The revolution against King Aras setting up the dominance of Tyson and crew,survivor,cegj6vx,1,t5_2qhu3

208477,0,t3_1wh28c,. Classic Survivor  Big emphasis on character survival and challenges although you can definitely draw a dividing line between Africa and Marquesas as the strategy of the show begins to develop an become more prevalent. AllStars which would mark the final season for most of these characters for many years is definitely the period on this era.. First transition  While the show still retains many of the hallmarks of the classic seasons balanced editing of strong characters Final  etc we also see crucial changes like the expansion of tribes the creation of the hidden immunity idol and the first instance of returning players in a non AllStars season. Guatemala which is both characterheavy and twistheavy stands right on this cusp.. Survivor Middle Ages  The tribe exile island season marked the truth birth of a new era of Survivor which included lots of players receiving less airtime more emphasis on HII and strategy and individual season twists like EI Race Wars Haves vs HaveNots etc. This era is less consistent and is marked by its highs China Micronesia Tocaantins and its lows Fiji plus midtier seasons like CI and Gabon sorry Gabon fans just my opinion. China and Tocantins are ostensible backtobasics seasons but they still date themselves to this era with the inclusion of HIIs EI and major twists. . Second Transition  Love him or hate him you cannot deny the impact that Russell Hantz had on Survivor essentially creating Modern Survivor. With his aggressively strategic gameplay as well as a production shift away from balanced character editing and toward lots of strategy we see a much different show emerge from for the next decade. This also marks the beginning of the shows practice of filming multiple seasons in the same location backtoback essentially the deathknell of the survival aspect of the show.. Modern Survivor Dark Age  Post HvV the show is marked by poor casting bad twists over reliance on returning players and lots of boringpredictable Final s. Not much more to say about this period that hasnt been said already.. Survivor Renaissance ? This appears to be the current era we are in as Philippines Caramoan postBrandon and BvW all proved to be aboveaverage to great seasons and demonstrated a great melding of the strategyheavy returneedominant hallmarks of Modern Survivor with much better character development casting and gameplay. The early promise of the Cagayan cast gives me hope that the show is continuing to move in the right direction. ,survivor,cf26t6i,5,t5_2qhu3
208714,0,t3_1wh28c, Golden Age . Survivor at its most pure and basic form. It was fresh it was popular and it was fun. Great seasons that may not have the same level of strategy that we know of today but it laid the groundwork for what the show is now. All fans at least appreciate this era. Experimental Age . Survivor feels different. They try new gimmicks and ideas such as returning players final threes and idols. You can see the show evolving...a few good seasons and a few awkward seasons. Not the shows worst era but far from its peak. The Renaissance . Survivor feels fun and relevant again. We have a string of great seasons minus Samoa and strategy is seen like it never has been before. Things are working and the show feels like real Survivor again...just like it was in the Golden Ages. The Dark Ages . A streak of average to poor seasons. Survivor at its absolute worst. Strategy and casting is boring and we get the exact opposite of what we want. Some new twists are played with but none of them work well. Definitely a sad time for Survivor fans. The Reconstruction Present. Survivor keeps trying new ideas but theyre actually starting to work. Some solid seasons that make us feel like its a second Renaissance but were still reminded that some of the problems of the Dark Ages are still carried over Uneven editing some poor casting choices etc.. Survivor isnt at its prime yet but its  starting to get there again. ,survivor,cf27sb2,15,t5_2qhu3

388816,0,t1_cfl1qtx,I would respectfully diasgree very strongly that insight into human nature cant be tought. Insight is learned from experience and sharpened as you meet different kinds of people and go through different things that expands your original schemas. Some people are at a natural advantage for reading and understanding people but I think its absolutely ludicrous to assume that someone who has  years of evaluating someone psychologically knows as much about personality and reading people as someone who takes  courses in college. Psychologist is a job and like all jobs you get better at it with time. A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing and its pretty easy to abuse it a psychology student is especially likely to do so.I guess the psych majors you know are very different than the ones I knew. The ones I knew were drawn to psychology because THEY BELIEVED they had an innate ability to read people which is a distinct difference.

She was a compelling character but she was really against the idea of the alliance and thats how Survivor evolved so she wouldnt have been a great fit for a returnee. The first returnee season AllStars already had  of the  people in the Tagi alliance anyway and so they went with a Pagong member Jenna L as the other Borneo rep. After that Kelly just became less and less relevant and as the show evolved into a more strategic show than survival show... It pretty much explains why she was never brought back.,survivor,cg9nba8,8,t5_2qhu3

And she especially wasnt going to win if they fuck everything up by following Sarahs lead which they almost did. Her flipping was probably a bad move overall. But at least she did something as oppose to just sitting by and guaranteeing yourself a third place finish.At least now she has some semblance of hope if she ends up in the final  with JefraTrish.

Erik got betrayed by his own tribe and Kelly went home just from selfdefence. Laura was mostly taken out by Shambos hatred of her. Taking personality out of the equation its hard to hold any of that against Russell. Hes just trying to stay in it like any underdog.After he got the numbers it becomes a little more complicated.

What if George Lucas said Vader is Lukes father btw before Empire Strikes Back came out would that not be one even if its from the official source?So a NSFW tag with a title like Number of Finalists Confirmed would have been a gracious gesture though not to only blame OP since others are posting it.

I disagree with many of them and I think shes been an extremely unpleasant person on the show but shes gotten this far because of what shes done. Shes played a strategic game to get her this far. This last vote she might have possibly avoided going home because people want to sit next to her but the vote was also as much about Trishs power.

1121613,0,t3_26yx3s,My advice off the bat would be to do  tribes of  instead. If you have  meetings a week thats like  meetings. For the first  meetings do tribal challenges with one winner followed by  TCs. That leaves you with  players after  weeks. Then Id swap to  tribes of  do  days of  challenges each  with  winner and  with . That gets you down to  going into meeting  where Id merge and from there you could probably do  challenges and TCs until the final meeting where youd go from final  to  and have the jurors vote for a winner. That seems the only way to me to make this schedule work unless these meetings are going to be super long because Im just thinking you need  minutes to explain each challenge  for them to strategize  for them to play it a solid  minutes for them to campaign after the challenge and then  minutes per TC. With  tribes of  youd need to do significantly more of these cycles each day to get numbers down quickly. With regard to challenges Id say you should include as wide a variety as you can. I guess it sort of depends on what you have for space but if you can include longer athletic challenges that just require a ball and some baskets or hoops etc. thatd be inexpensive. For challenge ideas you should check out this homemade series Paul Asleson made. He has some solid inexpensive ones. One in particular he uses is an endurancebalance challenge of standing with a marble on a ping pong paddle with one hand. Not too different from one they use on the real show. He has a really cool tribal challenge where the tribes have  fairly wide wooden poles and  of their members have to hang onto them while the rest of the tribe carries the poles in a race. I would definitely implore you to do a gross food challenge or  tribal and individual with like sardines pickled onions hot peppers etc. Tribal Councilwise Id have a set of generic questions ready that you can ask every tribe and then if you think of more specific questions during the challenges or TC you could throw those in. ,survivor,chvsdhk,3,t5_2qhu3

Furthermore the Brains had lost all challenges with Garrett. Its acceptable that theyd lose another one if not  spoiler they did end up losing and I dont think Garrett would have done anything to make Spencer beat a basketball player in basketball. Given this information it would be rockdumb for Tasha and Kass to vote Jtia off because when they lose again and they have to expect theyre losing again its one of them next. When youre already losing repeatedly and on the bottom of the tribe challenges become as irrelevant as anything especially with  tribes where being the weakest tribe is a huge advantage in merge. So they flipped the script booted the guy running the show to ensure theyd make the swap or merge and in the long run both of them made final  with Spencer.

After the game I had talks with producers and psychologists alike and while a lot of people tried to pump me up and tell me I played a great game I truly didnt feel that way. I felt that because my game was so radically different than my pregame expectations of how Id play and what Id accomplish that Id failed.Ive come to take a bit more pride in my game and say that there were definitely things I did well but I still try to stay humble with respect to my capacity for strategic acumen I do think I lack some of the life experience and interpersonal skills necessary to take the strategic ideas in my head and make them a reality.,survivor,civtvzh,22,t5_2qhu3

1451133,0,t1_cixxusa, Believe it or not Im actually pretty charming in real life so I like to think anyway.  Everyone who makes it onto Survivor is very charming to some degree.  But people who make it far and especially people who win Survivor are next level charismatic.  Probably the type who go into politics and lead church revivals.  They make you want to drink the Koolaid.  The difference between them and me is this... I have no filter.  If you piss me off I will tell you right away and probably at a loud volume. Better players are able to hold in their anger and just vent about it when its confessional time.  Im probably a little too opinionated and bossy and Im not sure this is something I can change.  And its very hard to fake it .  At least it is for me.  I think Ive learned quite a few things from all the amazing charming people Ive met that have done very well on Survivor.   Be genuine and enthusiastic. Take time to talk to everyone not just the ones you like.  Emphasize how much you want everyone to work together as a team offer to help others a lot.  Share information and listen more.  Smile a lot.  This might sound dumb or obvious but as someone with resting bitch face I have to constantly remind myself to smile more!Anyway these are just the things that dont necessarily come naturally to me so they are the things that I needed to work on personally.

I dont have the exact same opinion as everyone who I feel watches the show as fanatically as I do. You will see I used the term superfan in quotation marks numerous times due to rsurvivor throwing that term around for that very reason you just said but of course there is certainly a difference a casual observer of the show compared to people who do watch more religiously. I do believe rsurvivor is a lot closer to being a casual audience compared to the likes of Sucks. Virtually everything is like this though not just Survivor. Reddit is a platform for casual audiences. Again nothing wrong with that but it is the case. As such there are notable differences between a casual perspective and people who do watch more devotedly.,survivor,ckjjoc9,0,t5_2qhu3

You have worked hard to get where youre at and you started working way before you come to the island. So with my work ethic background I give credit that to you. But on the other hand your inability to admit your failures without going into a whining speech makes you a loser in life.Kelly the raft persona queen. You did get stomped on on national TV by a city boy that never swam let alone been in a woods or jungle or rowed a boat in his life. You sucked on that game.I was your friend at the beginning of this really thinking that you were a true friend. I was willing to be sitting there and put you next to me. At that time you were sweeter than me. Im not a very openly nice person. Im just frank forward and tell you the way it is. To have you sit next to me and me lose  just to stomp on somebody like this.As the game wore on and the two tribes merged you lied to me which showed me the true person you are. Youre two faced and manipulative to get anywhere you are at in life. Thats why you fail all the time. So at that point in the game I decided to go out to my alliance with my family and just hold my dignity and values in check and hoping that I hadnt lost too many of them and play the game as long as possible and hang in there as long as possible.But Kelly. Go back a couple of times when Jeff said to you What goes around comes around. Its here. You will not get my vote. My vote will go to Richard. And I hope that is the one vote that makes you lose the money. If its not so be it. Ill shake your hand and go on from here.But if I would ever pass you along in life and you are laying there dying of thirst I would not give you a drink of water. I would let the vultures take you and do whatever they want with you with no ill regrets.I plead to the jury tonight to think a little bit of the island we have been on . This island is full of pretty much only two things  snakes and rats. And in the end of Mother Nature we have Richard The Snake who knowingly went after prey and Kelly who turned into the rat that ran around like rats do on this island trying to run from the snake. I believe we owe it to the island spirits we have come to know to let it end in the way that Mother Nature intended For the snake to eat the rat.,survivor,cl02g7y,28,t5_2qhu3

I ended up going downstairs and telling my dad very hesitantly that there were thousands of burgers upstairs. lmao. I guess after that I went upstairs and went back to sleep.I thought at first that the weird dreamhallucination was just something random but time has made me realize it could have been the food deprivation I was unknowingly inflicting or maybe a reaction to taking Robitussin on an empty stomach. shrug Anyhow I think it was trying to give me a hint eat some damn food!

2151630,0,t1_cldad7b,they had no idea James had an idol so it really shouldnt have played into their planning process. I think it would have been smarter for them just not to do this plan at all and actually try to develop a connection with James and Aaron. basically they knew the plan was going to make anyone from the other tribe who found out about it hate them. thats a risk but if it gets them to the merge with even numbers then hell might be worth it. but when they didnt throw the second challenge what the hell did they accomplish? they had no numbers and no one was willing to play ball with them anymore. know why no one wanted to work with PG for the rest of the game? this move right here. it wouldnt have worked out for them any better but at least their move would have been logical... ,survivor,cldbkcm,1,t5_2qhu3

2166668,0,t3_2jqzzz,Id like to say Spencer. Younger Saractic college kid who is a student of the game and could probably hold his own on a few challenges that suited some of his skill sets.

2170567,0,t1_clfbacy,Its partly based on that scene but I suppose I just think that she would have thought Tony played the better game. Trish was more wellliked than Tony though so maybe she would have won. I guess I just like to give jurors more credit than they deserve and act like they dont just vote for whoever they like more. Tony definitely made the right decision when he got rid of Trish though and his game should be held in higher regard because of it.

2173054,0,t1_clg0z99,I think Woo and Cassandra are both better than Clay. They at least had shots at winning although Cassandra had almost no jury threats in the end game of her season aside from Yau and Earl. Clay did a few things right but being actually dragged to the end and pretty much losing all chance to win by like final  makes me fine with calling them an outright bad player. Brian only really lost him like Helens vote as far as I know. Clay lost Jakes vote himself Teds vote himself and trying to understand Jan Gentrys mind is an exercise in futility but I dont think those two got along.Becky sucked. Yul says she was deep into the strategising which if true just makes her worse. She let yul take all the credit for and be the face of their alliance did nothing at all to distinguish herself from him didnt take the opportunity to vote him out when she was the only person in the entire game who could have and just generally appeared to not be trying to win.

2203596,0,t3_2kbqbh,I tend to be an optimistic viewer. I dont like to write seasons off prematurely because the outcome the person eliminated at the end of an episode is not the person I most wanted gone. In the end this season like all of the others is its own story and narrative and so far I feel like it is very different from any season prior to itnot to say it doesnt share similarities to earlier seasons. The original BvW felt like an experimental test run that in the end we as viewers were better off not seeing. This season feels like the second test that is being done right. At the end of the day I dont feel like the ultimate outcome is a given I do feel like there are a multitude of unique characters and storylines going on and I feel excited and compelled to watch each upcoming episode. Thats the most I can ask for from a show where in the end the producers have very limited control over the outcome. ,survivor,cljxipt,2,t5_2qhu3

2216337,0,t1_clliyy0,TV was done differently  years ago though and the stories werent told the same way as they are now. Im not saying that starting with Borneo wouldnt work out it might be the right approach for a lot of people. I do think it can sour some people in the show too though people who might have liked the show for what it is today but find it hard to get into when starting from the start. Starting with Borneo also presumes that you will eventually watch all seasons something which is a mighty big project to do. Maybe my perspective is a bit skewed though since I didnt get into the show until about  years ago. I started with the latest season at the time One World yeah I know... and then went back and watched all the older season not necessarily in order. I had however already watched all seasons of the Swedish version of the show so I was familiar with the concept which maybe made the experience different from me. It just often feels like in these discussion that people who did watch the show from the start promote watching the show from the beginning cause thats how they did it and thats how they think the show should be experienced. I dont think you can have that same experience now  years later though. Starting from the start is of course still a valid option but Im not convinced that its the only way to do it or necessarily the way to best get into the show.,survivor,clljslk,1,t5_2qhu3

There are a lot of twists and turns and suspense but its all about the characters and the way all of their arcs interweave and find closure impresses me a lot.

Plus Jon isnt malicious towards those he plays with and probably could win several jury vote combos regardless.

Carolina Spencer Sidney Brendan Tyson Debbie Coach although not directly voted for but hang in with me Taj Sugar Cirie Tom and James were ALL aligned with JT at the time that they were voted out by him.

Id like to see him back which probably means he wont be.Missy  Maybe a possibility although I think theres a LOT of better older female options lately so it would be a weird choice.Baylor  Same as Missy shes a big enough character but Ciera is a much better version of the archetype theyve shoved her into.Jon  Big edit and genuinely seems like a nice guy. Im sure if they do the inevitably unfortunate HvV hed be considered. Im not sure otherwise.Josh  Reed  A lot of people in here seem to be pegging Josh as a shoe in and I dont really agree all that much. He was a great narrator and really important in the beginning dynamics but ultimately I dont think he was memorable enough to be brought back. Reed kind of usurped his edit as soon as he left and honestly I think hes doing it better then Josh was. That said Reed would need to make a run at the endgame to be considered because  episodes does not a returnee make. Either way theyre so interchangeable as far as casting archetypes go that Im not sure how they would choose between them?Natalie  This is really unfair but I feel like the twin gimmick is going to hold her back from being asked back to Survivor.

They would not hesitate to switch sides. And nobody would vote for Alec at the end so hes a good Final  option for them. We know from the episode that Alec was getting close to Jaclyn. And Jon was friends with Drew Alecs brother.Keith on the other hand will never work with Jon amp Jaclyn. Keith is the only other challenge threat to Jon to keep him from winning Immunity week after week because Keith is apparently good at winning random challenges. Keith is a number for Natalie.

Specifically Im pretty sure Survivor just doesnt want any visibility for their sponsors rivals e.g. if someone showed up with a Tmobile hat during a season where Sprint is sponsoring the family visits bit with their phones.EDIT Ive also seen a ton of ponderosa vids where their shirts have been blurred out.

Most wanted Paschal or Kathy to win so Neleh may not have been a well accepted win either but at least from a viewers point of view Neleh flipped on Rotu which was something. Vecepia just floated as either someone too low on totem pole of minority alliance to be booted or as part of a majority alliance that didnt really do anything but boot the Rotu .I really think the editing was poorly done and its a shame. We didnt see that Vecepia was making friends with everyone because she didnt have to do anything else while Neleh was pretty unfriendly to those she didnt need to be friendly with.

The show has evolved past the initial premise of building a society while voting each other off to a show that is predominantly about voting each other off while living with each other. Its a change in how the show is presented and while Im sure it would still be entertaining if they stuck with the former I think its a little naive to think the show would still be going strong if it hadnt taken on the more game elements. As an aside as much as producers are often faulted for that change by some fans I think its important to realize that they do listen. People complained about uneven editing and recent seasons have been better. People complained that it was too strategy focused and weve been seeing more camp dynamics.

When I or most other SJWs get vitriolic its almost always because were tired out and pissed off. Sometimes after so much niceness and couching and allowing for context or circumstance or whatever you still get people who absolutely refuse to take your point seriouslyand those people in my experience have almost always been men almost always been straight and almost always been white. I dont think that pointing that out however implies that all straight white men are closedminded bigoted andor unwilling to listen and learn. If you are a straight white male and the comments I made didnt apply to you I dont see why they would have been so insulting because they werent directed at you. Maybe I didnt make it clear enough that when Im saying they dont realize Im talking only about the people who well dont realize. ,survivor,cpm3r7a,0,t5_2qhu3
3455256,0,t1_cplq3d1,As strange as this may sound I think you and I are actually on the same page. In my post I was simply trying to tell some stories that I hadnt had a chance to talk about in my exits and as a result I didnt go into the Carolyn thing. Its pretty much the main subject of most of my exits. I dont think for a second that I was voted out for being an annoying superfan. That may have factored in the NCs vote but Carolyn was the deciding factor that night and not them. We had Kelly. We just didnt have Mama. I wasnt voted out because Shirin and I were constantly strategizing in plain view. The footage you saw of the group in the shelter and us by the fire was from the last half hour before we went to tribal. For the two days before that we made a concerted effort to stay apart. I wasnt voted out because I put my foot in the pot as I was instructed by Dr Ben and the rest of the Survivor medical team after they removed the stingray barbs from my feet. I was voted out because I did an atrocious job of securing my alliance with Carolyn. I misplayed that relationship from day  onward and by doing so I sealed my fate. Shirin and I told Carolyn about the decoy vote both individually and together prior to that first Tribal but apparently she didnt ever fully understand that Soquin were going to write her name down instead of Shirins. Carolyn is a very emotional person and the shock of seeing Jeff read her name rattled her. After we got back to camp she asked Joaquin why he had written her name down. He told her Because Max told me to. From that point onward Carolyn was under the misconception that I was gunning for her when in fact I wanted to work with her for as long as possible. I actually had told her before the first vote that I would go to rocks if Tyler didnt vote with us and I meant it. That would have been a great first Tribal no? If I annoyed Carolyn it was as a result of my association with Shirin who tbh was deliberately being annoying a lot of the time. Shirin was running a psychological warfare operation on Joaquin for much of the time between the first Tribal and the swap with the aim of making sure that he didnt reintegrate back into the tribe. LOL. That backfired. Carolyn saw me as a threat to her game head of the snake cult leader who had a rock solid second vote in Shirin and good relationships with the two guys. She was going to get me out before I got her. I wasnt going for her but she got me. ,survivor,cpm4ita,24,t5_2qhu3

3600899,0,t3_31ljh3,I personally enjoyed it a ton but thats probably because I had chosen to be a huge Keith fanboy before the season even started. Watching SJDS and treating Keith as the main character made it so pretty much every episode that he went to tribal was suspenseful and awesome. Watching my boy Keith survive until the final four was an insane roller coaster.Looking at it a wee bit more objectively Id say its fairly middle of the road. Natalie was a good winner Missy was a decent villain and Jaclyn and Jon had a fairly compelling and unique story. Josh Jeremy and Reed all added some spice to the middle of the season and Wes and Alec both had moments. But I guess the problem with all of the statements I just made is that I cant commit to wording much stronger than decent and fairly. Drew was legendary though.Also the whole reward challenge pity contest that occured every week postmerge got old really quick. A fair bit of the emotional sequences felt somewhat forced due to the BvW twist those included. Not Keiths though since hes the GOAT. And thats all I really have to say honestly.,survivor,cq2q88j,2,t5_2qhu3

They showed that characters dont need to be one dimensional and strayed from the mactor majority that dominates so many seasons.

3745376,0,t1_cqj6a7w,I wonder if saying the same thing for a third time will help but probably not. Im not saying they shouldnt edit the show along the same guidelines but giving Cochran  confessionals instead of  so that say Brenda could give her take on things instead of being ignored for  consecutive episodes would make the show better They frequently go out of their way to ignore contestants and every contestant almost always has at least something relevant to say. They have  coverage and youre telling me that they had nothing except cochran? Im not saying to make these characters huge or very important hut give me fucking something.And i didnt dodge your question I just didnt think it was relevant. The editors have enough content that they can craft dozens of different stories. When they make every story revilve around one character whether they win or not makes it boring. Even in Amazon the story didnt revolve around Rob despite him having by far the most airtime.  They have edited well in the past so you cant tell me they suddenly dont have enough footage.,survivor,cqj74vd,1,t5_2qhu3

3753740,0,t3_33elpr,Summary of my own personal social media observations    Uninvolved pretty much completely Lindsey So Kelly Nina Vince  Some involvement Joaquin Will Rodney Carolyn   Fairly active Shirin Dan Hali Sierra Tyler  Very active Mike Jenn Joe Max      Of these bestie groups involve a core of Jenn Joe Mike and Hali with lots of Sierra and Tyler on the side when theyre available. These guys hang out have viewing parties and go to sports games together.   Theres a sub bestieness with Max amp Shirin of which Jenn Joe and Hali seem to be in on now and again.  Theres less so hang outs with Dan and these usually consist of him Mike Sierra and Tyler.   Rodney and Joaquin seem to hang out a fair amount independently.   Kelly has been out with the group once.    What can we infer     The prejury boots make up the majority of noninteractors not too many close friendships made there downsides of early booting.    That the core friendship will somehow have spent a lot of time together to form a good bond ie late gamers or shared time in Ponderosa  which seems to have come true.   States of residence is probably affecting the amount some contestants hang out and their status is hence hard to deduce.,survivor,cqk5jc9,16,t5_2qhu3

3765739,0,t1_cqlik41,Very true. I think wed all agree that the editors work in mysterious ways and that they may have had some reason for painting Shirin as an innocent victim and Will as a loose cannon. I guess well see if thats a continuing trend in the coming episodes.And to be certain Will is not the only person who has expressed dislike for Shirin. All season people have been complaining about her and we got an episode partially devoted to just that. However unless the producers are working on a Shirin angel edit which is possible I cant imagine that they wouldnt include something that would lead Will to react that harshly toward her.But anything is possible and like you said we arent in camp with these people  and there are lots of other factors that could contribute to a lashing out of that magnitude.,survivor,cqlitqk,3,t5_2qhu3

Like Taylor Swift and her dozens of songs shitting on her exboyfriends you eventually reach a point where you go maybe its you.I just dont think her personality is the type you want to be stuck on a Island for  days with.

So essentially since they werent able to predict who placed where based on the edit that this season is shit and they are done watching. Mind you these same exact people hack on RI and Caramoan. Why? Because they are predictable. Yes wtf right?

Im totally cool with Hatch Heidik etc. winning because the story being told is that you have to be dark and machiavellian to win but with Tony they very clearly told a story that the way he was playing was not correct and yet it still ends with him winning. The season was a very deliberate propaganda meant to bring more stupid people over to the big moves camp hence why they ignored the hours and hours of footage of Tony actually being a hardworker and beloved as a funny uncle by the tribe. They specifically showed him as a villainous chaotic Tasmanian devil to try to convince more casuals that that is how Survivor works. Seeing how many people still claim that Tony is Russell with a nonbitter jury which is the least true thing ever Cagayan did exactly what it was meant to do. ,survivor,cr82gd8,0,t5_2qhu3

Dont forget that Jenn was around still then too and would have heard about Wills wordsactions not only from Shirin but also from Mike.  Also the nocollars didnt seem to have much affinity for Will as part of their group to begin with leading to how easy he switched alliances at the merge. The grid looked a lot different last week with Tyler in the game it looked very close between those him amp Mike.  Yes it might be obvious at the moment who the favourite amp goats are.

3973029,0,t1_cr93bem,My focus is mainly just the impact on Mikes alliance Dan and Sierra. He pulled the wool over their eyes in order to protect himself and them but he couldve just told them beforehand what was up. So faking Dan out was... the worst possible way to handle it. Dan naturally felt burned was hurt and didnt believe Mikes excuse afterward which is understandable. It didnt help that Mike then started a fight at camp while everyone was reading their love letters.I dont particularly care for Dan Im just trying to give him a fair trial because thats one thing he hasnt gotten lately. Theres a violent pissing party on the dude just based on some unsavory moments and his overall character edit. Yeah hes a blockhead sometimes but I think the antagonizing hes gotten online has been disproportional and toxic when you can see through the edit that hes probably a nice enough guy if a bit of a ham.With that said the above paragraph isnt targeted at you since youre just defending Mike in a logical manner and I only responded so we can better understand every players perspective when Mikes letter bluff transpired which was an awesome moment as a viewer and when I began to like him.,survivor,cr95pt2,1,t5_2qhu3

3999694,0,t1_crbxyjb,Meh. Maybe youre right. I dunno. I want Carolyn to win since shes my favourite so youre getting my hopes up convincing me I might be wrong. She did consistently have a small handful of scenes in most episodes but... I just dont feel like they add up to an arc or a story for her. She really only shows up when shes necessary for the plot I feel. Being annoyed at Max and Shirin doesnt really count as winenr content I think... And the way shes getting tons of focus now feels manufactured to create doubt. And like I said I dont feel were meant to really understand her in these episodes. I think its pretty rare for us to go into tribal council NOT knowing what the winners plan is. We go into the past two tribals wondering will she vote out tyler? will she play her idol? which I feel is because the editors care more about creating suspense and drama and less about making us understand and relate to carolyn.also I dont think Mikes content from premerge was plot relevant really... there was a lot of other stuff they couldve shown. fighting with the girls for example I dont feel was absolutely necessary? I dont remember all of it but I dont think he became plot relevant until after the merge really so all his focus before that is a good thing.and yeah we also got insight from people like spencer and malcolm. malcolm wasnt an underdog though so I think its different. and with spencer there were just...there were other people who still had a chance. a big part of my mike support is because I still just dont believe carolyns edit could support a win. in spencers case other people still had good cases for them. I actually havent seen  so I dunno about chase. and stephen was so long ago that I dont think it applies anymore the show is edited differently now. though  and  were both very tricky,survivor,crc73et,1,t5_2qhu3

In fact from the edit he seemed oblivious to the fact that Will even thought about flipping with Vince. After the tribe flip a challenge was literally thrown in order to vote him off and he was only saved by a bold move by Mike and Dan. They decided to keep Joe and potentially alienate their ally Rodney in part because they wanted a big target in the game because everyone would unify against him and because they knew Joe couldnt get to the end because he was SUCH a huge target. So he was almost voted out at that point as well. He only survived to where he did because of challenge wins which there was no way he could win out from the merge you need to have numbers at some point... speaking of which he was never really in the numbers the entire game except for the Nina vote.I dont think he was a very good player.

4035092,0,t1_crfxyyj,Mike should of clean sweeped the game. Lets face it this season should of been called Survivor Mikes Journey. Most of the decisions especially post merge revolved around Mike. Rodney abandoned ship because he didnt like Mike and wanted to run the show. When he was trying to do that earlier Mike shut him down by voting off his white collar buddy. Even with an alliance the game still revolved around mike because now he was the bad guy. Hell they got Sierra and Dan because again because of mikes paranoia and bad move at the auction which lost certain peoples trust. After that Mike didnt just survive not being voted off but planted seeds of mistrust among their alliance and saved Carolyn by telling her she was a target while also convincing dan to consider using his advantage. He didnt just survive by winning challenges. He was still actively playing the game by helping get the biggest threats to his game off like Sierra and Tyler as well. He then proceed to make rodney and Carolyn look even worse with the fire challenge. I guess people can say Mike played a bad social game but was that really true? Outside of the auction move what did he do that was terrible? Considering how the alliance formed he was also right about rodney flipping and trying to get him out. Doesnt that get taken into consideration regarding his dumb mistake? The guy had a hand in pretty much every thing. Either that or the game shaped because of him even if he wasnt the one making the decision. Thats pretty damn impressive.,survivor,crg8bmv,2,t5_2qhu3

I love the game I love the opportunity to play I love the title of Sole Survivor but I will be less willing to backstab a good friend if we are just playing for a title..

Then Probst decided to do what he did for Cagayan and Worlds Apart. He probably wanted a new theme and then realized he could just do BvBvB again. You could say this is a marketing gimmick and to some extent it is but casuals REALLY LIKED Cagayan. I mean so do we but Cagayan  got all its people in from the pool even Kass who the cat ladies hated.

4179523,0,t1_crwmust,I hear that a lot but I really dont think that juries have ever changed.  I think that Survivor juries have always only had one criteria  who will you be able to sleep at night knowing they beat you?  So I think juries always come down to who do you respectwho do you like the most and I dont really buy that strategy or big moves are any more important now than they were in Borneo.  Richard won because the jury liked and respected him more than Kelly and Mike won because the jury liked and respected him more than Will or Mama C.  I really dont think that variable will ever change.I will always consider Survivor to be a social game that cleverly gets disguised as a strategy game. ,survivor,crwo4wb,21,t5_2qhu3

Parvati specifically had the Bonaduce Fairplay quit that saved her from first boot a Penner evac that saved her from thish and the other evacs that brought her from rd to the win. Its incredibly possible someone could play Micronesia and not fall into those holes. Like Cirie if she had won the final challenge would likely have won the season without needing  quitsevacs to achieve that. She wouldnt have the same conditions and issues Parv did.Also I cant say this enough clearly but I like Parvati a lot. Im a fan. She just sucks at Survivor. One of my favorite top  or so players is Eliza and shes TERRIBLE at Survivor.

4247630,0,t1_cs4ctc2,gt I started a rewatch of Amazon yesterday and I find it hypocritical how sexist his confessionals were especially in light of this last season and the outrage over a few comments.His comments are bad and are kind of uncomfortable.  I dont see how that is hypocritical though.  If youre talking about his man hating podcast this season I think that was more because of fan reaction than necessarily strictly his own line of thinking.  Either way Im pretty sure over  years people grow up and change their opinions about things.  Similarly the audience is much different now than it was then and most of them probably dont remember what happened in the Amazon if theyve seen it at all.  Anyway I would not be surprised at all if Rob said those things simply to garner more air time.  As for this past season I think there was an over reaction to things this season and it was more a case of people being assholes and not thinking about where they are saying or simply not being able to express their thoughts in a way that doesnt come off shitty.  Still perfectly good reasons to hate on those people.,survivor,cs4f54d,2,t5_2qhu3

4401054,0,t1_csl5idy,There are two kind of bitter jury members in my opinion and only one of them is tolerable.  If someone makes a personal promise to you then stabs you in the back in order to get further in the game then you have every right to be bitter.  But when people are obviously on the bottom of a large alliance and they flip over then you dont get to be bitter because they didnt give you a cake walk to the final four.  Instances like PaschalNeleh in Marquesas and Cirie in Panama.  They get rid of people in their alliance who had no intentions on taking them to the end and then the people voted out get bitter when they themselves planned on doing the same thing.  Getting mad at people who dont owe you anything also bothers me.,survivor,cslqepw,2,t5_2qhu3

That means that even if Ozzy was planning to take Yul out at third he didnt have the opportunity and didnt know it. Had Yul not had that idol either he doesnt flip Jonathan at final nine or Ozzy and Sundra can at least attempt to vote him off at final four if not final three. Tonys idol meanwhile expired after final five in a season with a final two. He still either had to win two challenges or convince people not to vote him off. Nobody was voting him off at the final four anyway even if he hadnt lied about the idol because he was smart enough to drag Spencer along as a meat shield and his social game was enough for him to convince Woo to take him over Kass.

China  Absolute favorite. The winners story arc is great from start to finish the challenges are really well designed given the location and the cast of characters is really great. Over all its a fun lighthearted season that barely nudges out my number  favorite.. Pearl Islands  Its great for all the reasons you already know and I know Im in the minority here but Lil is potentially one of my favorite Survivors of all time. A really great season that for me is nudged out of the number  spot just because I think the winner was just ok.. Vanuatu  Another fun season with a really great cast of characters but I really enjoyed this season because of how the womens alliance story arc was set up premerge and what ended up happening postmerge with a winner who won against really tough odds. ,survivor,ctccp5e,2,t5_2qhu3

4782439,0,t1_ctxbeex,Im still working on a smoother mechanism for it but basically everyone gets three shots in front of them and then one person asks a question ie whos the most annoying or whos most likely to go streaking. We were playing with a rather large group so instead of giving out individual pieces of paper I just had everyone text me first who they thought best fit and then also who they thought would be the most popular answer. Then I counted up the votes and announced the most popular answer and named everyone who got it right. Those people could then assign shots to anyone in the circle. Once you run out of shots you still vote for who you think it is but you dont say who you think is the most popular answer. Thats just so the number of people voting doesnt go down. And in our version the person who asks the question doesnt vote but they can be an answer. As of right now its a little over complicated so Im gonna try to see if theres an app we can use or something. But in any case it ends up being really fun and much like the survivor version the last man standing tends to be the quiet likable types. ,survivor,ctxd7ku,17,t5_2qhu3

I was yelling at the TV.Its so nice to see classic challenges  i.e. not just minor variants on  go through obstacles retrieve puzzle pieces do a puzzle. The classic challenges might produce some onesided results e.g. the boats  fire challenge earlier this season because once you get behind its way more difficult to catch up but they feel more...honest. More realistic. And the times when there is a comeback  like this one  it feels so much bigger better more deserved.It feels like producers are in love with these get puzzle pieces do puzzle challenges is it results in both tribes or a few people being in the final phase at the same time therefore it seems more suspenseful.

All the players who never found idols that did better in the game than Russell are they all better players than Russell? Just because you find idols and use them correctly doesnt mean youre a good player. And again being able to lie doesnt make you a good player. Loads of people have lied well in Survivor. It doesnt make them good or bad.Wanna know what does make you a good player? Using an idol in a way that people want to give you their jury vote is what makes you a good player. Lying to people in a way that doesnt lose their jury vote is what makes you a good player. Like you said Russell is great at manipulating people but bad at connecting. Unfortunately the latter is much much more important than the former. Just ask Natalie.gt He recognized after Bretts third consecutive immunity win that he needed to promise Brett a Final  spot so that Brett would take him if he won yet again.Do you actually believe that made a shred of difference in the game? If Brett lost he was going home regardless. If Brett won Russell was still safe because everyone wanted to sit next to him at the end especially Natalie. To believe that Russells promise to Brett was a great move is an insult to Bretts intelligence.Russell is not a very good player. Hes a pretty poor player.

4932566,0,t3_3igm00,I think it has potential to be better than HvV. While I enjoyed HvV there really wasnt a lot of personality with those players aside from a few exceptions Rob Russell Parvati. While many of the players were good originally they were somewhat boring for the most part. SC has a lot of people with personality many with more complex ones rather than a hero or villain. In HvV there were only about three or four people that appeared to be playing strategically whereas SC has a few people who can be real players. Plus SC has the addition of some potential twists that are brand new whereas HvV didnt really add anything new. And with SC everyone knows the competition. Theres no Russels that no one has no clue about. Equal playing field. I think SC can be great.,survivor,cugaf3o,2,t5_2qhu3
4932814,1,t1_cugb4si,But those things are just as true. I judge skill at Survivor based on your chance of winning it in the format everyone is playing for. If Parvati played the pregame and first  days of Micro so poorly that she was going to be first boot if not for Fairplay getting assaulted by a former child star of the Partridge family that off the bat makes her win a little less impressive. There was a tribe swap and again she played herself to the bottom of the tribe with Penner and Eliza pulling in Kathy Jason and Alexis. Then more evacs and Parv doesnt have to face the music again. And then postmerge she played for the final  with Cirie and Amanda where she could not win mathematically. Shed have  votes bu the other  votes were CirieManda votes. Why should Parvati get any credit for being a goat? Lots of people have played for a final  where they had no chance of winning just like her. They could do the F surprise twist in other seasons and suddenly we have winners like Natalie Tenerelli Lisa Whelchel and Cassandra Franklin who I dont think anyone would hold in the same esteem as they do Parv. I just fail to see how Parvatis game in Micro is NOT a complete fail when she was going to lose the game  times over and had medevacs and quits stop that from happening where in the end she wins  as close as possible over Amanda strictly because Eliza thought Parvati was a slightly smaller idiot. Thats a fail in my book.As for understanding how winning the game works I would think that someone who plays to be a runnerup twice doesnt really get it. Parvati is dismissive of people she doesnt need or who she thinks has wronged her alienating Penner and bullying Eliza such that they went into the swap with a huge chip on their shoulders against her. Belittling James Erik and Jason betraying Ozzy without the depth of character to realize why he was upset. She and Russell quarantined themselves from the other  Villains because Parv didnt feel like socializing with them anymore and she went into Merge with a huge chip over the Heroes trying to blindside her at  so she ignored them mocked them over bananas and plantains and would sit by the fire at night with Russell reading the letter out loud and laughing in earshot of the remaining Heroes. As I said she does not have the social graces to be nice to people who have targeted her or who she feels are beneath her and this shows a fundamental lack of understanding that to win the game the jury has to respect you and have a connection to you. I say CI is her best game because there she was at least in range of winning if she could string a few challenges together. If she makes the end with  Aitus she had a solid shot with the Raro jury. If Penner doesnt flip on Raro she seems like a very likely candidate to win. Much much better than Micro and HvV where she played to lose the jury vote. Im not bothered by placing. Phil placed nd in RI and th in Caramoan but I think its clear which season he played better in just as an example. ,survivor,cugbjoa,3,t5_2qhu3

5073618,0,t1_cuxee6i,gt Plus he hardly keeps up in the Survivor community at all. He doesnt get involved in social media or anything like that. He basically shuts out the Survivor community entirely. He shuns it like he was never on the show and wants nothing to do with anything who was on it. I follow over one hundred Survivors on social media. I used to follow Grant on twitter like I follow a ton of Survivors on twitter but he posts something there like once every  months which is pathetic so I unfollowed him and his instagram is set on private. Almost no other Survivors share so little of themselves.Please tell me youre joking. Get a life dear. You are way too obsessed with this show if you think about it that way. You dont own these people. If you think not caring about the Survivor community makes someone a bad person you are seriously deranged. Like are you seriously mad that he doesnt post on Twitter enough? Ridiculous.And sure Grant was bitter against Rob and that shows hes a bit of a sore loser but lets not act like Rob was some deep childhood friend or anything. Robs a professional reality star who Grant knew for six weeks one summer and then they lost touch after Rob betrayed him. Oh well. Both their lives were fine before and both were fine after.

I think the way he was portrayed as a halfway villain in Panama will make people not think of him as much of a jury threat. I think the way that he was portrayed as only surviving from his challenge prowess is going to make people not view him as a strategic threat. And if hes not as much of a beast as he was  years ago he wont be as much of a standout physical threat. At least not while Joe Jeremy Spencer possibly Woo Keith and Savage are in the game.

Brian Heidik was  in this one. With the second one I averaged together placement voting accuracy votes against and tribals survived to get one percentage.

If your criteria for a good player requires that they be the ones in drivers seat youre casting a lot of pretty bad players as good and a lot of pretty good players as bad.The whole situation on Luzon is messy but again it is to Spencers credit that he survived that situation.  Where you would argue that it was good luck that allowed Spencer to live I would argue that it was his own abilities that led him to survive that situation and that if anything it was bad luck that got him into that situation because he aligned with Garrett before there was evidence that Garrett was MONSTROUSLY bad at the game and then Garrett being that bad put Spencer in a terrible position through no real fault of Spencers own I grant you that Spencer could and should have fixed the result of Garretts terribleness sooner however.,survivor,cvk2ay0,7,t5_2qhu3

AbiMarias melt down was truly what gave him the ability to go after it.Also playing with AbiMaria is like playing with fire and Jeff handled it really really well this episode.  Part of the reason hes better at it than Rodney as the poster below said is because Jeff is able to actually connect with people.

It allows for some really powerful emotional story lines and fun moments to me it likens back to last season when either Max or Shirin was gonna be voted out and all of the fun moments we got that episode except I think this one was even better since Shirin and Spencer both knew they were screwed and we got to see their reactions to their alliance crumbling and the realization that they would have to vote for each other.

My thoughts on itWithout any context of how they would play their games I agree that it would be much more satisfying to have  time player win because its a much cleaner response to Sandra for GOAT if you want to make  the  for  response.I also think its inherently more interesting if someone who isnt already an icon of survivor Cochran and Rob belong at  and  but Id also put Parvati near the bottom of the list Hatch is an obvious exception.Id also probably curve it more in favor of the old school winners because i think its more interesting to see a player win what is essentially  entirely different games though Tony would be a hilarious awesome  time winner.,survivor,cvqpbgi,2,t5_2qhu3

5320317,0,t1_cvrol96,Id argue its worse. When I flip on some garbage sitcom I think Sure its lame but it exists to be a safe time killer and thats what Its doing.  But when Survivor gives us some poorly edited ugly dull piece of garbage its all the more disappointing and hard to watch because I know how great the show can be. And it can actively put me in a bad mood. EDIT So like when Brenda makes Dawn take out her teeth to publicly humiliate her and Probst asks Dawn if she wants to apologize or when Will screams at Shirin and tells her nobody loves her and scoffs at her teary confession that she was a victim of domestic violence and then gives so half assed apology about her being who god wants her to be or when we get shot after shot of Phillip Shepard pretending hes crazy and babbling on about code names and running around in pink underwear or when contestants waste a bunch of TV time talking about vote splits or going on scavenger hunts or giving you false hope that they are going to vote to safe one of your favourites or when the show decides to give you the Boston Rob variety hour every week or when Richard rubs his dick on Sue your thought is Eh still better than Gotham or some shit?EDIT  I guess you could argue some of the uglier drama is inherently compelling but come on some seasons have had some monotonous stretches. ,survivor,cvrqdzh,-5,t5_2qhu3

5365289,1,t3_3oia9f,Carolyn!!!! Let me start off by saying that you were absolutely unequivocally AMAZING in Worlds Apart  you literally made the season for me as a fan and provided me with immense amounts of joy both entertainmentwise and from a killer strategy perspective. In my opinion you played one of the most incredible games of survivor in the last decade and it was CRIMINAL that America didnt see how much of a BADASS you are as Im sure you wouldve kicked hella ass in the Second Chances season. However hopefully this will allow you to fly under the radar when you finally get your much deserved second goround at playing. I want you to know how thankful I am to have such a role model to root for during Survivor Worlds Apart and that there are many many fans like me who saw how smart and savvy of a game you were playing out there and are incredibly grateful to have been able to watch you out there. I mean lets be real  anyone can win challenges  to consistently get the numbers on your side be able to adapt to  tribes play your immunity idol when you were gonna be blindsided and still make final tribal  your game was legendary and in my mind you win like  of the time your season plays out unfortunately stupid Mike kept winning those challenges. One thing Ive always been impressed with in regards to your game but also a bit confused about is after you idoled out Dan at the final  tribal why werent you the number one target of the RodneyWillSierra alliance at the Final  vote? Rodney and Will went for Sierra after Dan was forced out  did they want to bring Dan to the end and now saw you as a better option instead of Sierra? Because if so that was some very impressive maneuvering on your part  getting rid of someone that solidified your spot in final tribal. My other question for you is  you played such a spectacular game but only received one vote. Do you think this came down to the jury not being able to see your strategy as clearly as those of us watching from home or do you think the jury was just so wooed by Mike that no one was too concerned about you getting second place over Will?Thank you so much for you time and once again congratulations on one of the all time smartest games and for contributing your awesome positive energy to the survivor community!! ,survivor,cvxh5u3,-1,t5_2qhu3

Theres definitely a certain subgroup of young women for whom bitch has been linguistically bleached meaning the offensiveness has been taken away from it. Among themselves theyll use the term without any insult meant.Maybe Abbi is one of these and Varner picked it up from her using it.I also believe that theres a certain subset of gay men who use bitch in a similar way.However in neither case should someone outside of that sociolinguistic group use the word because of other negative connotations. Unless of course previous usage has been made explicitly ok. To use a better known example its ok for people who speak AAVE to use the word nigga.

Only thing I saw was Ciera knowing Abi had beef w Woo.  She basically gave her what she wanted to not lose the person she wanted to stay.gt I seriously dont understand her logic.She has no relationship w Woo.  She never played w himSavage and Kass have.  Spencer she knows is a threat and a shield and Kass wants him gone.  Now Savage has taken a shot at Spencer and hell be more willing to go after Savage.  If Woo goes then very easily she could be the one on the bottom.  She noticed Savage offering her name up to go if an idol is played not the ones not originally on their tribe so he made it a bit obvious he values Abi and Woo over her.gtIts not a power move if you make a stupid move that doesnt really benefit you.It does benefit her...  She got rid of someone she has no relationship w that Savage in charge values over her.  She got the other Angkor person he bonded w and valued over him to betray his trust.  She got Kass to betray his trust.  Spencer now wants to go after Savage.  Kass is still going to want to oust Spencer.  She has positioned herself nice and if she plays it right she gets no lashback and a bunch of other people will have beef and feel betrayed.gtSpencer likeable challenge winner mental mastermindThe mental mastermind thing is pretty funny.  Theres nothing wrong w keeping threats early so they have war at the merge and shields you can operate around.

And we also have Ciera and Kass who have been together since day . JeremyStephenKimmi have proven to be a voting block on the Monica vote. And I see no reason why this wont be the case again coming into the merge Tasha amp Savage Given the time spent together in the Angkor tribe I feel these two will stick together and align with JeremyStephenKimmi Spencer Abi and Wiglesworth. Despite having his ass being saved by Kass previously I have a feeling his relationship will Jeremy will become an important factor this vote. Abi could go either way she has the option of TashaSavage or KassCiera. Abi is tricky because she flips on all her alliances. She immediately flipped on Savage and is the reason why it was Woo who got sent home instead of Savage. But there is still a lingering suspicion she could align with Tasha again. But for dramas sake lets say she will align with the people who helped her get rid of Woo.Maybe this is where will see Wiglesworths breakout episode hopefully not her last.

5556714,0,t1_cwlit85,The problem with Earl is that he was never as flashy and never really had any real opposition. Nat had some underrated strategists on her season including Jon Jaclyn Josh Reed and Wes. The dynamic way that she adapted throughout SJDS exhibited that Nat could cockroach through many difficult situations. Furthermore Nat blended Danniesque UTR elements with aggressive BResque gameplay that not many winners aside from maybe Kim have managed. The key to winning Survivor is flexibility after all.Although Earl is fantastic he didnt quite have the dynamic gameplay and stayed the course. To use Rob Cesterninos Evolution of Strategy metaphor Earl maintained the course of the river while winners like Nat not only maintained the river but also subtly redirected its course to best help her.If Dreamz gave up immunity Im not sure what to think about Earl. Unlike Natalie Earl doesnt really feature a lot of UTR elements to his gameplay which could theoretically help him acclimate to some truly WTFy situations.Of course both of them are great winners who also happen to be peopleofcolour.

5558121,0,t3_3r7rql,in a normal season AJs archatype usually works pretty well but it seems that on a returning player season the archetypes just dont line up as well.Here is my attempt at it. Diplomat  Spencer I think Diplomat is a much better fit than Cheerleader with his focus this season being on his social game. Also AJ described the diplomat being able to somonehow insert themselves into things which seems to be Spencers forte even if its not all on his own merit. Marriage  Jeremy Jeremy as the narcissist in SJDS is something I can get behind but he is playing a much better and more selfaware game this time. Also his relationship with Stephen has been highlighted in almost every episode. Jeremy has said he wants to be Stephens new JT. Seems like a clear choice for marriage of convenience. . Mad Scientist  Kass Kass at Mad scientist is right on the money you never know what crazy thing she is going to do.. X Factor  Joe Not an amazing fit but I think Joes extreme challenge ability sets him apart and makes him the X factor. Captain Loophole  Kelley Wentworth Kelley is pretty much the definition of Captain Loophole. Its what got her voted back on this season. . Idiot Savant  Ciera I love Ciera and hate putting her here. There wasnt a great fit for her my only rational for this is she seems to come out of no where and make big moves. . Marriage   Stephen See Marriage . Old Reliable  Kelly Wigglesworth The definition of Old Reliable. Kelly is the epitome of this role she is going to work hard at camp give it her all in challenges and you can tell her where to vote and shell go with it.. Narcissist   Andrew My life is perfect by the way did you hear the great sob story about how I met my super model wife??. Loose Cannon  Abi selfexplantory. Cheerleader   Tasha Tasha at cheerleader is a bit of disservice to the work she put in at Angkor to flip the numbers around but AJ had her as it in Cagayan and I think it still fits to a certain extent. You always see Tasha cheering people on at challenges I specifically remember this in the Hero challenge. Also they keep showing her oggle Joe which also could play into this role.. Ninja  Kimmi Aside from Monicas boot episode we have heard almost nothing from her. Fresh Meat  Keith Keith could also be the old reliable he is pretty interchangeable with Kelly Wigglesworth in general.,survivor,cwm1axe,4,t5_2qhu3

5602926,0,t3_3ruz3k,Ive been arguing this point as well. Kass just repeated what Tasha said to the other Bayons. Even though she knew it wasnt true Tasha said it and thats what Kass was arguing.But I dont think she was completely Kumbaya Kass. The ChaosKass part of her also comes into the picture during the argument. Kass started the conversation with Tasha seemingly almost hoping to use something against her. Even though according to interviews she only did it after she heard her name floating around the fact remains that she went straight to Chaos instead of trying to keep her temper and just calmly solidifying her alliance with KeithJoeSpencerKelleyCieraAbi to just blindside Tasha without much fanfare.I think the bulk of her elimination could definitely be attributed more to her not being able to change peoples perception of the ChaosKass character than anything else. Prior to the last couple tribals only Wentworth seemed to be suspicious of Kass. However after saving Spencer and then arguing with Tasha... Savage Joe and Keith all jumped ship as well without a second thought not even considering her more sensible behavior prior to this tribal because they figured it was just Chaos Kass coming out to play. And she certainly couldnt change Tashas mind about her.Id say its definitely a bit less black and white than everyone has been thinking it is. I feel that both sides of the argument have some kernels of truth within them. However I do think Chaos Kass did end up coming out to play one way or another even if it was just how she presented the false information to Bayon by calling out Tasha in front of everyone and starting a huge argument between the tribe.,survivor,cwrli03,27,t5_2qhu3

I mean I think its just baffling that you said if she was toxic we would be hearing about it as a defense when almost all credible testimony we have has said exactly that! Would it only be appropriate to consider negative thoughts of Tasha if every player decided to trash her in exit interviews?Also Shirins opinion of Andrew is irrelevant. They spent no time in the game together and not even a pondersoaprejury trip. ,survivor,cwwmu3e,12,t5_2qhu3

Keith represents another physical shield though Jeremy is obviously more physically intimidating Keith has the advantage in Survivor postmerge challenges and has shown to be better than Jeremy many times over. And Spencer... well Spencer is basically a backup Joe and Stephen. If one of them is taken out he can argue for Spencer as a threat in either category.

5674792,0,t1_cx0hz4t,Look. I know that I have a better understanding of what facts and opinions are than the average person does. I try my very damnedest to be respectful in explaining this to people but theres a certain stubbornness a need for their beliefs to be facts or for their opinions to be considered valid ironically the thing youve just atrributed to me.Plainly put  of the arguments I get into on here are a result of a disagreement between myself and someone else about what constitutes a fact and what constitutes an opinion.You mentioned unpopular opinion threads and thats a great example since I consistently scroll past actual opinions and respond to things that are not opinions and not true. Like an example Michael Phelps is really freaking good at swimming. If youd argue with that you dont understand what swimming is. Right? Isnt that a fair statement? Or go even further the sailfish goes  MPH. Id say that the sailfish is good at swimming. Id say if you dont think the sailfish is good at swimming its a lack of understanding on your part of what the word swimming means. To me this makes perfect sense.If I post on rswimming an unpopular opinions thread and someone puts down Hey I think Michael Phelpssailfish really suck at swimming Im gonna jump on that. Because it isnt an opinion any more than the earth is flat. You CAN be objectively good or objectively bad at a skillactionsportgame. I think  times out of  with the examples youre citing its a case like this where someone says something objectively untrue calls it their opinion then is upset when contradicted with evidence.

They just had her vote for as long as it was good for her. So she could have been said to have been part of their voting bloc but not their alliance.It also makes being a lone wolf not as scary. Join majority voting blocs when you can dont piss anyone off dont be too much of a threat and hope you last until a solid alliance wants to flip and decides to use you. That has always happened but its never been articulated and people used to be terrified and scrambled a lot when in such a situation.The Witches are I think a great storyline.

The men really sabotage themselves.The series was called One World. So at the outset the men started stealing from the girls as soon as they got off the truck refused to share chickens or tools with the girls even in exchange for anything else and despite the fact they were living together in the first challenge one of the women injures themselves and the men choose not to play on but take the victory by defaultReally stupid macho attitudes that galvanised the womens attitude that they were an oppressed unit and needed to fight the men together.If it hadnt been for the mens thoughtless attacks on the women early on they might have been more easily turned on each other as women often are in most other seasons.,survivor,cxap7jz,-1,t5_2qhu3

5770589,0,t1_cxcbull,What is so different between Woo and Joe? Theyre both young athletic guys and neither one has any discernible strategy outside of winning challenges and being nice and loyal to the big number alliance. Also I never compared Tasha or Kelley to Tony. But I will raise this point. Name one person still in the game right now that is more hated than Tony Vlachos was at his FTC. The jury came into that tribal council with venom and they ripped him apart. Yet he won a million dollars because unlike Woo they recognized that Tony outwitted outplayed and outlasted them all even if it was less than honourable. None of the remaining players are anywhere near Tonys level of hate from the current and potential jurors and all of them except perhaps for Abi Keith and Kimmi can argue that they are outwitting and outplaying Joe.Joe has not done any effective strategizing thus far outside of that one instance when he figured out that Fishbach was after him. Which was an effort he gave up on quickly when Savage failed to come through with the numbers. Last time Joe played he more or less just gave up when he lost the immunity challenge and didnt do anything worth talking about to save himself. Im not seeing any big changes in his gameplay in that regard this season. If hes up there alongside anyone who can argue that they actually played Survivor and played hard Joe is in trouble. This is not Survivor of fifteen or ten or even five years ago. This has become a game where a guy like Tony can swear on the lives of his wife and child that he wont vote people out and turn around blindside those very people while breaking that promise and be given a million dollars by those same people while sitting next to a really nice helpful strong young guy. This is not so far fetched when you think about it. ,survivor,cxce8f8,1,t5_2qhu3

They could all have hated Joe to pieces and they still would have made the moves they madeSpencer has no connection to Joe whatsoever and he voted against Stephen instead of Joe.Im not about to ride a Joe hate train but he really isnt a social agent in this game.  He doesnt get what he wants because he wants ithe gets what he wants when other people also want it.  Hes also not a strategic agenthe let slip the information that sent his biggest ally home Savage and he hasnt had any real input that affected votes that I can see.Joe is a challenge monster a very nice guy that is helpful around camp and a potential jury threat because of those things.  But thats the extent of his Survivor skill from what weve seen so far.  His survival this week is not attributable to any strategic or social aspect of his gameplayits attributable to his four challenge wins getting him to a point where suddenly a F alliance is emerging and theres just enough time for the other players to stop it and theyre up against the wall and have no intelligent choice but to keep him.,survivor,cxeq82u,3,t5_2qhu3
5789684,0,t3_3ufzh3,I agree with you.  I dont think this has been a bad season since there are enough returnees who I found interesting their first time around that I have people to root for.  And I think you do need to give the players credit for playing hard and making the most of their second chance.  But my favorite part of Survivor is watching relationships develop and seeing how the game impacts those relationships and this season has very little of that.  I think thats in part due to all the swaps but also because this group is good at recognizing when a relationship has formed and breaking that up by voting out one of the group.  I can acknowledge  that this is good gameplay but it makes for a soulless season in my opinion.,survivor,cxerjrf,4,t5_2qhu3

Maybe tribal councils in Worlds Apart were better than ones in SJDS but camp life elements were better in SJDS than WA leading the community and Jeff to have differing opinions on any given season.

5884325,0,t3_3vs9yh,I dont think that a season being the best ever is something that can be planned or defined. Much like how it is so difficult win just by having a great strategy alliances and social game. There are so many different variables to survivor that it is impossible to say that a certain combination would lead to being the best season ever.Take China for example. Many would list China as one of their favorite seasons and sure there are some qualities to it that you can attribute it to such as the use of culture the interesting players and the strategy. But at the end of the day at least to me the reason China is so great is because when it was all said and done you can feel a certain connection a certain bond with the cast almost like you were there on the island with them almost like you experienced everything with them.

5919459,0,t1_cxv6wys,At a glance it looks like he is but I dont think that that really represents too much about popularity on the show. Either his or Robs followers still make up a very very small  of Survivor viewers  like barely more than  if that which of course isnt also considering that their followers might come from other pursuits they have or their reallife families friends and social networks that have nothing to do with popularity on the show. Many of those followers could come from just being more active andor witty on Twitter than on other contestants. If somebody never really Tweets and Cochran used to tweet a lot at least and still does semiregularly they probably wont get as many followers somebody may not even use Twitter at all or somebody may use it but not go for witty zingers as much as Cochran does  and absolutely none of those have to do with the show itself. Cochran also was on the show more recently after Twitter became a big thing. If Twitter had existed earlier in the shows run it is pretty likely that contestants like Richard or Colleen or Colby or  Stephenie or whoever else would have gotten a bunch of followers at the time and still have them now his greater number of followers doesnt necessarily mean he was more popular or noteworthy during his seasons as those contestants were during theirs his seasons aired when Twitter had already become a big popular website while it didnt even exist for much of Survivors run.So yeah he is and good for him for succeeding on social media  but when Twitter cant represent how popular early contestants were during their seasons because it didnt exist Twitter followers can just come from Twitter activityentertainment rather than show popularity... and every single one of his or any contestants followers still is just a small small percentage of the people who actually watch the show again assuming they all come from the show at all which surely the overwhelming majority do I dont think it really represents the Survivor audience accurately or says much about his popularity on the show.,survivor,cxvkme5,1,t5_2qhu3
5919661,0,t1_cxvl3jv,Not OP but I think he was citing a scenario in which someone who was saved by an idol played by someone else in the FTC still wins. In this case assuming Sandra got th and Jerri took her place in the FTC. Jerri was saved earlier in the game by Parvatis idol play so technically she shouldnt be there without Parv. However I think OP is saying that Parv wasnt very well liked by the jury and therefore even though she saved Jerri Jerri still could have beaten her in the jury vote. ,survivor,cxvlknx,11,t5_2qhu3

Now I feel the only seasons to truly benefit from three tribes were  and  with  being more because of the smarts of the veterans than the three tribes and I have a hunch the knowingest knowitall was itching to introduce voting blocs for years before his return. Many say Cagayan was unpredictable but I disagree that that was due to three tribes. Postmerge there were only two voting factions and I think the shifts were part of Tonys plan from before he hit the island in which he would keep shields around Spencer and Tash and flip from alliance to alliance.

5981399,0,t1_cy3nhvr,Dabu you made comments that you hoped the water in a certain challenge would turn to acid just long enough to remove Spencer from the game.  I think its a fair assumption to make that you arent overly fond of him based on evidence from various posts of yours but I apologize if dislike is too strong a word to adequately convey your feelings.  I do think you give off the impression that you do not like him by saying things like that though Im guessing that you just dont care for him as a character.Kimmi and Abi are the only ones that have really been explosively negative about Spencer as far as I can see and they were equally negative toward Tasha if not moreso while multiple people have been more negative regarding Tasha without being negative toward Spencer. Looking back at word associations Joe described Spencer as witty and described Tasha as crazy and Ciera described Spencer as so very smart  like a little brother and described Tasha as passive and dry.  Keith presented with a hypothetical SpencerAbiTasha F indicated that he would lean toward voting Spencer and made a point of saying not Tasha.  Stephen has remarked that though he wasis quite fond of Tasha there was hate his word not mine for her that he didnt understand.  He poked his head in to agree with another poster that she did a great job of making people feel good within her alliance but did an abysmal job of making people feel good outside of it.  He expressed surprise toward Spencers move to get rid of him but didnt personally express any dislike for him toward it.  Kasss description of Spencer was downright polite calling him probably too cerebral for his own good which seems to indicate sadnessdisappointment with how things ultimately shook out rather than malice or a desire not to vote for him.  Her description of Tasha is vindictive.  We can also observe in the show that no one from F onward is considering targeting Tasha and the one side of the whacky Tribal that happens only targets her because they literally dont have another choice.  Kelley doesnt try to get Jeremy to turn on Tasha she tries to get him to target Spencer.  Thats not strong evidence but its evidence that both sides knew that Tasha was in trouble at FTC and therefore not worth removing.  And then of course Savage was quite positive about both of them and Wigs wasnt terribly positive about either but also wasnt very positive about Jeremy or Kelley tbhAnywayIt seems pretty clear to me that Tasha caps below the number she would need to win no matter what she does in the endgame and it also seems clear to me that Spencer does not.  ,survivor,cy3oye9,2,t5_2qhu3

5985471,0,t3_3xf77e,I personally found Spencers edit this season painful to watch because after the eleventh or so time of Spencer talking about having feelings whilst several returning players got less than a handful of confessionals I felt irritated on my behalf as an audience member and on the other players behalf. I kind of want Survivor to chill with how heavy the edits are starting to foreshadow the finalists and also to realise that I dont need to see a goats The Secret like transformation played out on screen. What I have seen from a lot of people saying that Spencer wasnt a goat is that they are relying too heavily on a very obviously hyper edited and narrative constructed season. Kimmi gave an interview recently in which she essentially said that the entire jury viewed Spencer and Tasha as this seasons goats and anybody could have sat next to them and won. That kind of comment should alert you to the fact that Spencers edit is disingenuous if you see no reason as to why members of the cast dislike Spencer on screen you need to realise that they simply didnt allow those things into the edit. One thing that I found really off putting about Spencer this season was the whole narrative revolving around I havent said I love you to my girlfriend. This may be controversial to say but if I was Spencers girlfriend I would be pretty pissed that he decided to use his story about being unable to declare affection as a way to bond on a reality tv show and then his first I love you has been utilised by the edit as a way to show personalgrowth on a reality tv show. I dont know guys that would just make me feel really manipulated. I want to flag that I was a strong Spencer fan post Cagayan  I was ecstatic that he got voted in to this season although not surprised and wanted him to do well. His edit this season really made me dislike him which was corroborated by the other cast mates comments and attitudes both pre and post jury.  ,survivor,cy48670,30,t5_2qhu3

I always felt like he needed a second chance to play and that he had so much to offer. When he was on again for second chances I was incredibly happy. I was able to see him play in the same ways I liked his first time around but also improve on what he felt made him fall short of winning the game. I saw countless players who were considered the smartest to go to him in order to decide if a move was good or not. I saw him find two idols and then successfully play both of them.

Wouldnt be able to do that here. The applications form didnt have much to go on either there was a couple Qs on the family and girlfriend but not a lot. Actually now that I think of it it kinda gives weight to the casting ten players thing because if it was BvW theyd cast  people and get them to bring a loved one and then youd have your .

6253770,0,t3_4189y9,I agree. I recently rewatched Pearl Islands with my friends and we all found it to be pretty average overall. The premiere is brilliant but the premerge lags quite a bit due to a lack of interesting characters especially the Morgan tribe with Tijuana Ryan S. and Darrah. Drake has Sandra and Rupert which is a bonus but I too find Fairplay rather grating and the Michelle and Trish boot episodes arent very compelling.The Outcasts twist is unfair but I do concede that the season was better for it and their two episodes especially the merge where Savage gets booted are great TV. From there on in the season picks up with the last few episodes but overall it was just a relatively bland season with a couple bright spots here and there.However youre not allowed to not think Pearl Islands is incredible around here so youre  upvote is not surprising.,survivor,cz0hhz3,3,t5_2qhu3

6270763,0,t1_cz2erk7,No Rob is an extremely threatening individual in that context and I honestly believe that given his personality at the time there was really not much to be done. To think that Rob couldve had a legitimate in on Rotu is to think that John and Tammy were fools and they werent. The reality is that many many survivor players have found themselves in nowin situations at various point throughout the  seasons. The idea that there is always a move that can save you is just a tempting fantasy.The other problem that survivor fans have is they are extremely extremely results oriented. So if a player happens to win their season its as if it was some fated outcome that that player is  accountable for. Unfortunately there is tonnes of variance and much of the game is simply out of any given players control.Which brings us back to Rob. The reason that he is widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time in my opinion the greatest is exactly because of the extreme control he asserted over his nd rd and th outings. I dont think you need to defend his Marquesas run either as it was clearly subpar and I do believe that much of that is ultimately Robs fault after all he is a big part of why his tribe is down in the numbers at the merge. I think thats different then saying that by the time of the actual merge he had much play left though.,survivor,cz2ez1k,1,t5_2qhu3

That is why we can definitively say that nd place means you have done better than th place. Thats what those numbers mean. The loser spots are not all the same otherwise why is nd getting paid more than th? The answer is of course because they finished higher. To extend this to sports again Team A might be a fantastic chance of winning the championship but Team B beat them even though they sit bottom of the ladder. It doesnt mean Team B are necessarily a better chance of winning the title but it does mean that in that game Team B did better.And I firmly believe that you cant reach the end game like that twice by accident. Look at all the other players who have gone final  twice Spencer Rob Amanda Parvati Sandra Cirie and Tina to name a few. And they are all considered to be generally be pretty good at the game of Survivor. Numbers dont lie.,survivor,czdvl2o,1,t5_2qhu3

6402551,1,t3_43d6c5,I believe that if Spencer had been voted out Tasha would have gladly flipped to the womens alliance afterwards. Ultimately she was there to win the game and shes definitely smart enough to sense that the wind is blowing towards an all female final three. ThereforeSpencer does NOT win the final  immunity and it instead likely goes to Wentworth I cant see AbiMaria being any sort of threat in Step On Up or the slide puzzle at the end. Jeremy remains the target of the girls alliance and either he goes or more likely he plays his idol and removes Kimmi from the game for her betrayal.Wentworth wins the final  immunity as again there is no reason to believe Abi would have a great effect on the outcome. Jeremy has either been voted out by this point or is left with no idols to play and gets removed If Jeremy did not play his idol at final  Keith goes to the house. Kelley potentially plays her idol on AbiTasha to solidify trust andor be seen to be making BIG MOVEStm by the jury.The final four is where this one really gets tricky. If Jeremy idoled at  and indirectly keeps Keith alive to this point he could potentially take this challenge away from Kelley and force the remaining women to vote out one of their own. I believe that it is safe to assume at this point that Abi is going to the finals. Tasha may try to put the vote against her similarly to how she did with Jeremy and Spencer by claiming it would be a travesty if someone like her was to make it to the final but it is almost impossible that Keith votes for her because well gosh whyd you get rid of Abi? I wanna go the end with Abi rather than youThis brings us down to Tasha vs Wentworth and I believe Abi amp Keith reward the relationship that Kelley has had with them and Tasha goes home.In a KeithKelleyAbi finak I believe the vote goesKeith Andrew Wigglesworth Tasha?Kelley Kass Ciera Stephen Spencer Jeremy Kimmi Joe Tasha?Abi unable to articulate the game she was trying to play and the fact that in almost every vote she was the one who determined who went home gets no votes.,survivor,czhelmo,2,t5_2qhu3

6403873,0,t1_czhbz7w,This is a really interesting discussion so I hope you dont mind that I keep disagreeing!gtFor my argument Im only considering Final  so the first one for me wasnt even something I was weighing.Thats fair but it was a scenario he sorta danced around postseason specifically hereSo at the final five when it was a possibility to take Abi to the end you didnt see the need because you had complete faith in your alliance with Skup and Lisa. Freberg I didnt need to. I didnt want to piss anyone off. I thought I had it.This was about going to the end with Abi and not just playing an idol on her to get Denise out but I think the logic is the same. This was the episode where he Skupin and Lisa swam with the whales and made their F deal so if hed really wanted to cement their agreement instead of just taking their word for it he couldve played the idol and ensured that Denise went home. I should note that theres no guarantee he wouldnt have been voted out at F regardless  Lisa claims she wouldve liked to go with Abi and Skupin to the final three and she definitely wouldve pushed for that if thered been a final four of LisaSkupinAbiMalcolm  but even then I dont think Malcolms game wouldve been totally lost because...gtThis last one I really cant buy because I truly believe that Skupin had to work with Lisa and as you said Malcolm was drawing dead with her.I think Skupin was very easily manipulated though of course thats IMO. But the guy had a huge ego and wanted to take Malcolm to the end as some kind of high noon duel against a worthy opponent and that was something he came up with independently not even with Malcolm whispering in his ear. If Malcolm had really pushed that  and if hed made it clear he was fine with Lisa going to the end too which he was because he considered her a goat as well  I think Skupin wouldve done it despite Lisas opposition. Hed voted without her before at F so it wasnt unprecedented.As for fire I absolutely agree it wouldve been risky but I also think it wouldve been less risky for Malcolm than any other player that season. He was the firestarter at Matsing you know? He did it even without flint. And he wouldve been making fire against Skupin or Lisa. I think he had a shot.,survivor,czhjzwm,2,t5_2qhu3

She was seen as weak and unprincipled because she was willing to bring Russell along. It cost her the game.Had she axed Russell it would have earned a lot of respect from the Heroes. It proves to them that she isnt Russells lackey it proves to them that she hates Russell as much as they do and she basically oneups Sandra proving herself to be antiRussell and the dominant player of the game in one move. On the surface it seems like a counterintuitive move but its ultimately the right move. Does she win in a landslide?

6558355,0,t3_45et34,Thank you for making this awesome post! One thing I like about KohLanta Ive seen like  episodes is that the show is actually about surviving and strategy is just secondary. In the US version its all about strategy and surviving is more secondary which gets old and leads to lots of fights on the island and lots of arguments on the subreddit. I like all the cool twists like the black vote treasure hunt and ambassador elimination because its not about strategy its about surviving and adapting to the twist but unfortunately that would never work on the US version.

6613725,0,t1_d03btnh,I agree with you that it might be more about the gameplay of the winner than the gender of the winner. When women play dominant flashy games i.e. Parvati and Kim they are hyped. When men play UTR games i.e. Bob and Fabio they are not. The problem is that most women who win end up playing UTR or perceived to be UTR games Tina Vecepia Jenna Sandra Amber Danni Natalie W. Sophie Denise Natalie A. at least in the beginning. Thus Jeff comes off as not admiring most of the female winners because he doesnt admire UTR players. At the same time this can still be problematic because often its much harder for women to play over the top dominant games.,survivor,d03eym9,2,t5_2qhu3

6656177,0,t1_d07s959,I think the widespread belief is that if theres a tie in a F with all players voting for one of two finalists the thirdplacer will cast the deciding vote.  If thats the case then any F with seven eight or ten jurors cant possibly end in a tie after a revote or two.  A F with nine jurors which hasnt been done since I believe One World can still result in a deadlock if it ends in a  tie.

Instead pile the votes on them. Then you play idol for the obvious target. Then your one vote hits your target without revealing it before hand. Just make it like you are preparing for the revote.The best part is it can work if your target was a huge threat and say had a third idol but didnt feel threatened.

Natalie uses the HII on Jacalyn but Natalie ends up going home because her vote was for Natalie and Natalie loses on the  revote with Baylor.Jacalyn still wins F immunity but heck even if Baylor wins it Keith is still the one to go and Jacalyn smokes MissyBaylor in F.This move seems impossible to have calculated but would have been the greatest move in Survivor history.

6774440,0,t3_48j2gr,I dont really see how she messed up. Kass was firmly at the bottom of the Bayon pecking order. She might possibly have earned a few extra days grace from the Savage mob if she had stuck to the plan and kept Woo around but shed still have been one of the first few people to go at the merge. To have any chance of making it deeper into the game Kass needed to build a counter alliance fast and there were limited people to do it with. Woo was firmly Team Savage and would never have voted with her Spencer still had no solid ties and there was at least a chance that he could have worked with Kass going forward. Keep in mind that Kass and Ciera had made a final five deal with Joe Keith and Wentworth on the second Takeo. If that deal had actually happened the way Kass must have hoped it would have they only need two more votes to take control of the game when the tribes merged. Abi hooked up with the witches anyway despite them not having the numbers so its fairly safe to say that shes in. Spencer was definitely not a lock to be the final vote but keeping in mind that Spencer has been scrapping for his life the entire time hes surely a better candidate to be that final number than Woo would have been. I think Spencer has even said that hed have gone with the witches had Joe and Keith actually been on boardPeople respect Kimmi for turning down a guaranteed fourth place finish and attempting to make a move that ultimately failed and saw her go out two spots earlier and I kind of feel like this is sort of the same thing. Kass may have avoided being first out in the merge if she had kept Savage sweet but shes still guaranteed to go out really soon if she just sticks to the script.

Not telling the person youre voting out that youre going to vote them out is standard course of action anyway even before AllStars... AllStars didnt change anything in that regard all it did was add the additional layer of friendship that gave Rob a personal incentive to talk it out with Lex and Kathy.

6870143,0,t1_d0uzxk2,I think it makes a bit more sense in context such as her kicking around sand while they are all digging or Alecia accidentally kicking sand into Scots face she apologized but it still happened. Im not excusing him. Im just saying that maybe at that point it could make sense to Scot to prefer her to do nothing instead of kicking sand back into where they were just digging and instead of accidentally kicking sand into peoples faces. I dont think that everything they do can be directly pointed at he did it because he hates her and because he is a bully especially when there is a lot of reasons in this scenario as to why someone could become very annoyed with her.Again Im not saying its right. But I dont think it is entirely unreasonable to be irritable when you just got a mouthful of sand kicked in your face because someone wanted to kick around dirt instead of dig like the rest of you. And I dont think its bullying to respond to someone like that in that situation with context in consideration.

6948928,0,t1_d13yyww,The difference between Joe and Jeremy is their archetype and the context of their edit. When did Jeremy say Wentworth didnt have an idol? At F Spencer told Jeremy Wentworth didnt have an idol but Jeremy correctly said he thought she might. Was it at F? If so he didnt say that at tribal or in a confessional. Joe said it in tribal in an episode where Tai talked about his idol multiple times. Also Joe didnt just say Tai didnt have an idol he said he didnt think there were any idols in the game. And the camera immediately flipped to Tai being a bad liar trying to say he agreed with Joe. Furthermore Joe has no redeeming content at this point whereas Jeremy was getting a very typical Type A strategic winner edit. The difference between Sandra and Aubry is that Aubry has told us shes worried Peter might be her demise and she repeated today she doesnt trust Peter. Furthermore she was worried Tai was a threat which the edit tells us he is because of his idol. Sandra wanted Russell out but Russell was never going to be her demise and she knew it. She just wanted him out for personal reasons not game reasons. Aubry does have some redeeming qualities but shes not playing the anyone but me game and she has not gotten her way at either tribal. Plus she had mixed tone episode one which no winner ever has plus she opened with OTT which is not a great opening edit. ,survivor,d13zqqh,2,t5_2qhu3

Probst said last week that Anna would be a great candidate for a second chance. If Debbie Kyle and Tai all lose this season they will be fast tracked into another one. That is minimally five players from Kaoh Rong or four if one of the trio just mentioned wins that will be back on Survivor and soon. Alecia would and should be ranked lower than all these players when deciding who to bring back. And if they do bring her back I just hope its not bc they want to restage the Alecia vs. Kyle battle. I had enough of it this season. ,survivor,d190aah,10,t5_2qhu3

I am quite aware it exists. It happens to both my girlfriend and my sister and it pisses me off being there when it happens and I hate the thought of it happening when Im not. However neither of them are in a company about this kind of thing and neither of them have been on the receiving end of this from very public figures. They or anyone else may post to social media and theyll get nothing but support. But when you involve public figures by posting pictures of them and an alleged story and your brand is dealing with exactly this and your first line on Instagram is I hope this goes viral it shouldnt be shocking to you that people see how convenient it looks for her brand.Sorry to break it to you buddy but sometimes people lie for attention.

And honestly Natalies game isnt necessarily conducive to exciting TV at times...audiences tend to like the flashier game over the effective game and the more memorable winners and players played up more to the cameras. She played excellently but I could see why theyd focus on the bull in the China shop.And I dont think Natalie is the leastrespected winner not when Amber exists.

7090809,0,t3_4cnr7m,My thoughts on my pick to win  Oh Aubry shes easily the best of the brains tribe and shes getting the rawest deal out of it all. First she has to deal with Debbie playing so hard at making alliances with the beauties that she inadvertently drove them all into the brawns camp. On top of that unbeknownst to her she became the target of the breawny alliance for a blindside and was on the verge of being voted out. Then she loses Neal her closest ally which on the upside saves her albeit in the worst way. To put the icing on the cake with Neal goes the hidden immunity idol she just found out about. Shes a very bright astute and crafty player of the game but the deck just keeps getting stacked against her.Other thoughts  Nick is looking to be a stronger and stronger player as the episodes progress. Definitely a surprising twist. I never pegged him as such when making my pick for winner. Jason seems to constantly be devolving further into antagonism. At this point even if hes at the end with Scot I cant see him winning because I can see the argument being Well he and Scot were both assholes but Scot is the lesser of two evils. Debbie as I mentioned before is too aggressive and it could cost the remaining three brains their whole game if Aubry or Joe doesnt convince her to reel it in and play with more subtlety. Was there even two words from Cydney this episode? I want to like her but it feels as though shes perpetually relegated to the background. Next weeks preview might be interesting for her. I felt that out of anyone who could possibly gel with the brains tribe it would be Tai and I think he possibly would have if not for Debs pushing too hard to bring him in.,survivor,d1k41lx,1,t5_2qhu3

Based on the information he had it was a very risky move that guaranteed him numbers at the merge had it and a very deep run in the game that could have ended in a second win given his natural charisma and physical prowess of the Heroes who made the merge J.T. was far and away the best physically.People talk about Gabes boot as a seminal moment in Survivor history but I never see it get mentioned as among the dumbest moves ever.

Everyone would have destroyed her since she was a horrible player who everyone hated so she needed  other huge goats to have any chance.  It just so happened she was a bigger goat than them but her not voting out Slob actually made sense.  Doing absolutely nothing didnt though.Not to mention being an incredibly weak player with no social skills she had no power in the game at all so she couldnt vote him out even if she wanted to.

I thought the response you were getting was ridiculously antagonistic and mostly not related to the point you were bringing up initiallythat theyre analogous characters very much cut from the same archetypical cloth. I think you also raise a good point about the issue with pseudoedgic which is how I also feel that I watch the show in that I dont really participate in edgic but I definitely analyze how the show is edited and in how that sort of discussion can be hard to separate from gameplay discussion. For me its very difficult not to consider how little of the game we see and how purposeful what they choose to show is so I always think of the events and contestants in terms of how theyre portrayed as opposed to what they appear to be doing. Trying to completely remove the edit from the discussion of strategy isnt exactly easy to do.,survivor,d21a3lr,2,t5_2qhu3

Shes pretty good at reading other people and seeing where theyre at. Shes unfortunately not as good at seeing how people read her namely how there were players in all three seasons who disliked her for the naivete that she presented and didnt respect her. I think Parvarti lucked out it in Micro being a F instead of a F.

IIRC Jeff made a comment about how Aubry was totally killing it during the challenge but then the show didnt explicitly do anything afterward to play up her success there. Usually when the show does mini redemption arcs like that youll get a confessional from the person after the fact talking about how great it felt to do so well after struggling before  or at the least a little moment where other tribe members praise them etc. As I remember it none of that happened which is kind of strange in terms of the shows storytelling. And personally if Aubry wins it surprises me that they wouldnt have made a bigger deal of her success in that challenge maybe her arc that episode was just foreshadowing for her postmerge turnaround? idk.Or maybe Im misremembering everything and my point is moot. But I do remember very much expecting a decisive conclusion to Aubrys story that episode and the show just kind of leaving it hanging for viewers to notice on their own as you obviously did. I would love for Aubry to win so I hope its just a small aberration and things like the Oregon Trail confessional are more indicative of her chances.,survivor,d2maowj,1,t5_2qhu3

It doesnt matter that we can see her rationale and IMO I think shes playing a killer game but I think the jury will be bitter in a sense.

It wasnt fun to watch this season at least for me and hear me now Survivor... DO. NOT. BRING. THESE. ASSHOLES. BACK. I love this show and am always sad to see a season end but in this case as in the case with Dan and Will Im glad because I hope never to have to watch Scot and Jason again.

They both came in fourth in their respective seasons. Cydney also finishes the season with the highest average weekly score. Caleb comes in second with Aubry having the third highest weekly score. Again Kelley Wentworth has the highest all time average score but Cydney Caleb and Aubry all have higher average scores than Kass who had the second highest average last season. Four players Aubry Cydney Neal and Caleb did not get a single negative score all season the same number as last season Jeremy Kelley Keith Kass The highest individual score of the season belongs to Aubry who received a score of  in Episode  for orchestrating the blindside of Scot. The lowest individual score of the season belongs to Scot who received a  in Episode  for being condescending to Alecia. The highest individual score of a noncompetitor belongs to Mark the Chicken who got a score of  in Episode  his breakout episode. That score was the fifth highest given out all season. According to average and cumulative score Anna is the most average contestant this season  people won the ignoble honor of having the lowest weekly score compared to  from last season. On the flip side  people won the noble honor of having the highest weekly scored compared to  from last season.  people Jennifer Alecia Scot Debbie had both the highest and lowest weekly score as compared to  from last season Jeff Tasha Spencer.

But second and perhaps most important its pretty clear that Tai is a gentle soul in his real life who is a gardener. Hes probably not used to dealing with such a duplicitous environment as the game of survivor. So he ends up being extremely poor at presenting his case and convincing others to go along with him because he probably never deals with scheming and psychological warfare like Jason and Scott were into.

7704831,0,t3_4kusoi,Its really hard to ban edit talk from all threads. Everyone participates in it whether they want to or not. Everyone knew Joe del Campo wasnt winning this season and alot of people knew Mike was going to win Worlds Apart even though he was the underdog. Its a little disingenuous to ignore the edit all together. The thing is edit talk hasnt increased this season compared to others. Its just that Michelles edit wasnt as obvious compared to previous winners like Tyson Cochran Kim Mike etc. For example the idea and talk of a Tyson win wasnt as much of a spoiler to people because he was one of the biggest characters that season and was the front runner gameplay wise. Michelle was more under the radar and surrounded by bigger characters like Tai and Aubry. So the talk of a Michelle win seemed more like a spoiler. To be honest I dont think this will be a huge issue moving forward. The issue this season was the combination of having no spoilers and an under the radar winner. I think there should be a thread focusing on edgic stuff but general edit talk shouldnt banned everywhere else. You cant really talk about Survivor without talking about the edit they go hand in hand.,survivor,d3hzktv,72,t5_2qhu3

The premerge isnt the best but its still solid and you get to follow two people who arent the most well liked on their tribes as well as lay ground work for the future. It also has the one thing I love the most in survivor complexity with the people playing and one castaways especially is a big example of this. Also has the best FTC this show has seen and one of the most emotionally charged final speeches. Besides maybe one speech every other jury member has an extremely memorable question or speech.

None of that happened instead he placed second one person said that he was deserving of a million dollars one person lashed out at him at FTC and he still didnt think he did anything wrong at the reunion and tried to paint Shirin as the bad guy.

7763444,0,t1_d3olklq,gt I think people can be too resultsoriented when talking about players that won their way to the end. Sometimes you have to roll the dice because leaving a player like JT or Fabio or Mike in makes the most sense for you even with the accompanying risks.Thats very true. The fact is I could only come up with  winners out of  that successfully managed to beat the odds and win those last few immunities while people like Cagayan Spencer SJDS Keith SoPa Ozzy and Brett all made it far but eventually failed.I just meant even though the chances of that happening are minuscule theyre still there and people are naturally inclined to be riskaverse. Few people would allow those threats to get close to the end and even fewer would actually try to use those threats to get to the end. However I will say weve been seeing a recent trend towards players who are more willing to use that strategy. Of the most recent winners Tony Natalie A. and Jeremy all used the shield strategy to great effect by making sure the rest of the competitors were completely paralyzed while SpencerTashaKeithJoe were all still in the game. Carolyn and Tyler also managed to utilize the shield strategy to great effect for the first half of the merge and only ended up blowing up for them in the last half not just because Mike won his way to the end but because Carolyn and Tyler were perceived as equally threatening. gt My comment was more about targeting those players in premerge when tribe strength and unity should be key. For example the No Collar tribe taking out Joe at the first time they go to tribal because hes too much of a threat in their eyes would be the wrong move.However this is my only gripe about the argument. One thing to consider is who will benefit from this style of gameplay? Sure Joe Jenn and Hali would benefit from the keep the tribe strong strategy but Vince Nina and Will would not and in Vince and Ninas cases didnt because they got voted out one after another while Will was spared by a swap. Depending on which person you focus on its a good move or bad move. And I think thats the key with the recent trend towards taking out the threats early on. The people taking out those threats are the ones who benefit the least from the keeping the tribe strong mentality. Cirie made the taking out the threats early on strategy famous because she would never benefit from a keep the tribe strong mentality. If the old women were focused on keeping the tribe strong she wouldve been the first boot of Panama. And I think thats where this mentality began. Since around Panama the people who are considered weaker have managed to start utilizing the strategy of taking out threats early to get themselves in a better position and not voted out in those first few votes as a liability. ,survivor,d3on5mc,1,t5_2qhu3

Sarahs just a hilarious presence in general and the whole people only like Hali because the rest of the cast was so unlikable thing that I see thrown around on here sometimes is way underselling her. If hes a premerge mess again Im excited about Brad. Troyzan could be fantastic if he doesnt overstay his welcome or get so much focus that he becomes overwhelming. Pretty indifferent about AndreaJ.T.MalcolmOzzy they definitely wouldnt be my first picks but theyre alright. Ozzys been like Rupert where he turns into more and more of a cartoon character with every appearance so hopefully he can keep that going. Love TaiAubryDebbie but its too soon.

That being said the post merge did become somewhat predictable. You knew it was either Spencer or Tony winning by the edit. As soon as Spencer was voted out it was  Tony winning. Everyone else was along for the ride. That being said the overall season is enjoyable. But it doesnt hold up quite as well as Philippines or China.Kaoh Rong is the complete opposite for me. Its possibly the best edited season ever and the winner surprised the hell out of me.  Not as strong a winner like Tony but the season as a whole got better post merge. ,survivor,d3yqbfz,0,t5_2qhu3

But unfortunately fandom labels Cydney as the aggressive one. Edit By the way Im not trying to come for you or trying to say youre racist.

I wish she was able to articulate all the moves she had made at final tribal council because she is responsible for the PeihGee Varner and AbiMaria boot and was a major factor in getting out Joe and Kass.

Also completely agree about the guys sucking this year. The problem is that in BB production cast to try to get a female winner amp a male still ended up winning. So they doubled down this year amp all the men are either actively terrible like Jozea Paul amp VictorWho I actually like because they are hilarious bad or passively terrible like Corey amp Paulie. Really the only guy that has any chance of winning IMO is Frank. I do really like Bronte amp Michelle tho.

Like Kimmi made him cry at Ponderosa in retaliation for how he acted in game.  To think that he wins easy is absurd let alone a clean sweep.Regarding the second portion of your comment you seem to once again forget about jury managementopinion.  Just because someone immunities there way to the end doesnt make them likable see s Kelly.  If anything a good portion of the jury would be annoyed that he kept winning immunity.Finally youre reasoning behind Spencer taking Kelley to the end is asinine.  Disregarding your assumption of Kelley having no agency in assuring her survival she clearly would have fought to stay in the game and would have shown herself fighting as seen in her performance at f TC him simply eliminating Jeremy isnt a bigmove that negates all of the bitterness on the jury towards him.  If anything a f with Spencer winning immunity is more akin to Russell deciding who he loses to in HvV.  He either takes Kelley or Jeremy and loses.Spencer was not the second best player of the season.  He played a great game to get to day  but he was dead in the water once Savage left.,survivor,d4zomrf,1,t5_2qhu3
8179777,0,t3_4rb2q4,Marquesas is only slightly less awful than Cook Islands but it is still incredibly awful.If anything it hints to the future of the show where strategy trumps character. Marquesas has a few strategically interesting moments but most of the cast is so awful and the season is overall so boring that those moments are drops of chocolate syrup in a bathtub of piss.

8212007,0,t3_4rt3f3,Not the biggest fan of Palau. Once youve seen Ulong being wiped out it loses that surprisefactor to me. The cast also has a few duds and Ulong kind of sucks. And by that I mean in terms of players on Ulong. They just arent that interesting as players. The only ones from Ulong I like are Bobby Jon and James. Stephenie is someone I dislike while the rest are mostly mehplayers and duds.Panama is great though. Super fun season. Cirie might be in my top  players of all time. Excellent playerofthegame yet managing to be super fun character. I know a lot of people think Penner is the best narrator on Survivor but I think Cirie just knocks him out of the park. Whenever she has a confessional you know its gonna be good. Casaya is also an iconic tribe and I dont want to live in the alternate universe where La Mina is the successful tribe while Casaya were the ones picked off. Ugh what a dreadful scenario.I think SJDS after BvW and Amazon Final  are next. I personally hope Cambodia after BvW and Tocantins Final . Its time for Cambodia to get its torch snuffed and Tocantins really needs to get the hell out of this ranking. It feels like Cambodia is riding the recency bias wave and its a season I expect to fall on the ranking in next few years. Tocantins to me is easily the most OK season aka avarage of Survivor ever and I never get the love and attention Tocantins gets from this subreddit. And I should have nostalgia glasses on when it comes to Tocantins seeing as Tocantins was my first ever season of Survivor.,survivor,d5420he,1,t5_2qhu3

After those two the best is probably Randy who held the record for most consecutive tribal challenge wins. Then you have the likes of Courtney Parvati Russell Danielle Coach one immunity each Sandra and Jerri no immunity wins.Compare that to the likes of Tom never lost an immunity challenge James Steph probably the two toughest of their genders Amanda nine individual wins total Rupert huge asset in Pearl Islands Colby set the immunity record that has yet to be beat and JT six challenge wins in Tocantins.

You may not like the edit because it was a season with a leading man rather than ensemble cast but the editing itself wasnt bad. Caramoan on the other hand was edited into a huge mess. You had characters that were meant to be hated in the beginning the cool kids alliance than later to be rooted for the three amigos you had strong charactersplayers in the beginning randomly become nobodies and irrelevant randomly at the end Sherri.

8808291,1,t3_50slto,Yeah... Ive watched the first five episodes and they were pretty decent but not omg better than us survivor!!!. My issue with it is that everything is just in excess and drawn out more than it should be. I dont really think that episodes have to be  minutes.  contestants is too many and it really shows in the inconsistent visibilityflat out invisibility of some people.  episodes a week is excessive imo especially with the extended time. Both episode  and  have events that delay the season and draw it out even further. In terms of good characters Ive really only enjoyed a couple which doesnt help my waning attention during the long episodes. I definitely think that its a little overrated so far. Its great that theres a foreign version that is fairly faithful to the US version but its definitely not without glaring flaws. Maybe its just because my attention span isnt that great I dont know but I can binge an entire season of US in a day whereas with AUS I find myself bored  minutes into an episode that is just over halfway done. ,survivor,d76mxcq,-2,t5_2qhu3

8834332,0,t3_514nkv,Heres my take on a  tribe BvW seasonInstead of a set of trios we keep it to  pairs. We distribute these pairs throughout all the tribes. Like this where Aa represents a coupleTribe   A B C D E FTribe   G H I a b cTribe   d e f g h iHere each tribe has  people with connections to one tribe and the other  have connections to the other tribe.Lets put Exile Island back in play. First place tribe gets to select someone from one of the two losing tribes to go to Exile. That person gets to choose someone from the other losing tribe to join them.Maybe after every reward we can reintroduce the concept of looting. The winning tribe must pick another tribe to loot an object from. However this might be grounds for an argument. Say Tribe  wins and A wants to loot from Tribe  because his loved one is on Tribe  but F wants to loot from Tribe  because her loved one is on Tribe . This could create some arguments.This could also make alliances even more catastrophic. Before people would sometimes make alliances while their loved ones would become enemies. Now people might make alliances while their loved ones are on entirely different tribes and have similar alliances of their own.You also have to be on the lookout for couples you dont know anything about. Tribe  knows nothing at all about couples Gg Hh or Ii.At the merge the tribes should all come together from  to  instead of first breaking down to . Its no longer a question of should we flip but rather which tribe should we flip to? I think the postmerge would be in a constant state of Cesternino mode and I think such a season would go down as an all time great.,survivor,d79rglt,6,t5_2qhu3

8879458,0,t1_d7f6e2v,Yeah its definitely a weird position to be in. Ill sit there wondering why people dont realize super obvious alliances potential moves etc but its so much harder when you dont have all the information AND when the information youre getting may or may not be true. Especially in this version when people can meet behind closed doors and much more secretly theres so much lack of information for everyone. I do think it gives me a unique perspective were I to ever play though. I have a better understanding of how people go through the game and try to learn information what works and what doesnt. For instance one thing Ive learned is that you have to give some to get some when it comes to truthinformation. People will often try to play coy in meetings and act like they dont know anything and its horrible for building trust. The subreddit is an interesting idea but I just dont know if theres the demand. The fanworks sub was created but was pretty small and so discussionadvertising episodes was never really there. With that said would be cool to have a dedicated discussion space for it.

9009552,0,t3_53k5pm,I think its less about a firm birth date and more of how you were raised.  There was a shift right around the early s from a time when parents didnt really know where their kids were most of the time.  Kids knew to come home when the streetlights came on.  In the s it changed to a society being worried about what would happen to unsupervised kids.  There were a lot of highprofile cases of missing kids and parents had to know exactly where they were at all times.  You no longer saw kids walking along the streets alone.  So if you grew up in the former you would probably identify with Gen X and if you grew up with the latter than you are probably a Millenial.  To me that is the biggest difference and most other differences are a consequence of this changing parenting style.,survivor,d7ut2sn,1,t5_2qhu3

Rob also says in confessional he didnt want to take charge and wanted to be a diplomat but when he realized it wasnt working and the tribe was floundering someone needed to take charge and his instincts kicked in and asked in confessional why he always ended on the buffoon tribe.So I think he treated them like that out of necessity not because hes some pompous controlfreak who needed to make sure everyone was eating and using the bathroom on a strict regime.

When i watched Samoa I was still more of a casual fan and was very pissed when Natalie won. But its what makes survivor so great being able to play the same strategically while also making the jury like you like you is incredibly difficult. Its something some players have absolutely mastered and more seasons than not have a very satisfying ending where the more deserving player and visible player wins.

Her ingame suspiciousness entitlement and overall shadiness creates deliciously petty awful but hilarious moments like Whats going on PeihGee?? and you little bitch. Its also just so incredible that she always makes it deep into the game despite her volatile presence but she is always taken out the episode before the finale because people just cant deal with her after  days despite her almost guaranteed goat upside.,survivor,d9fm8mt,5,t5_2qhu3

Now a lot of people myself included dropped Hannah as a contender after her switch of vote in episode  amp her attempt to explain to Adam amp Zeke in the start of episode . A decent amount of people saw it as too negative for her to be Winner.edgicHowever rewatching the episodes a second time shows the moment isnt really that negative towards Hannah. She gets to explain her entire reasoning why she did it in her first confessional amp neither Adam or Zeke talked bad about her in any of their confessionals during the episode. Hannah also got time enough to explain her new strategy moving forwards by her Use me commentedgicAfter that she got two episodes to cool down amp then she again got some very strong emotional content in the way of feeling weak at the challenge. She again didnt get any form of negativity thrown her way from her tribemates amp she used the moment of weakness as a way to take a breather from the game but not make it a hindrance for her down the line.edgicLastly the latest two episode shes gotten more strategic content which seems to be kind of normal for female winners when the merge is coming up. Hence in my opinion I still think Hannah has a chance amp Ive seriously started to consider her as a contender despite her bad showing in episode  amp .edgic,survivor,d9xkhsr,6,t5_2qhu3

9643434,0,t3_5d4hpe,Australian Outback was the most widely watched season if memory serves me correctly back when Survivor was still a cultural phenomenon and not really a game. You see this in how the season had a more balanced edit that focused on camp life and personal relationships rather than focus on the strategy of voting players out. I would say Colby had the most impact highlighting the importance of choosing wisely who to sit next to at FTC. Next would be Tina who demonstrated a strategy that didnt rely on a simple Pagonging in order to makes friends on the opposing tribe and take the gold. Jerri would be third as the first true villain on the show.,survivor,da1r3dp,9,t5_2qhu3

9684426,0,t3_5dbtc5,The aim of Survivor is to not get voted out make it to the end and then earn the majorityplurality jury votes. Arguing the best player isnt the winner is like arguing that the medivac shouldnt be pulled from the game. You could argue that Parvati isnt the best player had YauMan not have smashed Fairplays head into the boat day  Parvati could have easily been the first boot. Had Penner not have been evacuated Parvati may not have won. Saying the best player isnt the winner allows me to state that Kim wasnt the best player because I didnt like how she dominating the game and she was a boring character. Winner bashing is so bullshit and it shouldnt exist. The winner was fortunate enough to not be voted off due to uncontrollable circumstances debatable twists super idols production interfering Probst forced Luzon to vote out JTia similar to the Stacey vote in s quits and medivacs etc. The winner of Survivor merely has to get to the end and earn the votes they can be a powerhouse go under the radar or anything in between. The twists in Survivor are legit regardless of how bullshit they f challenge in KR and we have to accept it. The best player will always win that specific season however not liking that player from a tv standpoint turns them into a less favourable player. The one thing for certain is that the loosing finalists are in the position of shame as they cannot argue that they should have won Peter Harkey Sole Survivor of season .,survivor,da6t6q9,1,t5_2qhu3

9692317,0,t1_da7qv8u,I just know a lot of gay people.  There are some who talk about it immediately after meeting people and there are people who never bring it up for years.  Bret seems to be one of the latter people.  Being around each other  is a bit of a misnomer because a lot of their day is structured around chores or interviews or challenges.  I could see Sunday talking about her religion on day one but dont know why Bret would ever bring his sexuality up unless he was surrounded by very liberal people who were talking about being progay which would make him feel safe enough to share this tidbit about himself.  This is  why I felt there was a bond between Sunday and Bret is she doesnt have this piece of information that would probably poison her against him.  So this thread confused me I seriously doubt she had any idea.,survivor,da7s82p,1,t5_2qhu3
9692574,0,t3_5dv2og,The thing for me with Tom is that he didnt want to take the alpha male leader role but he was forced into it because everyone looked to him for leadership from the start. Like at the end of the first challenge the group basically pushes him to choose to go to the new beach and then when they end up not liking it Caryn blames him for it. So the condescension most of the time comes from the fact that for the whole tribe stage of the game everybody was looking for him to make all the decisions. I also think that youve incredibly hurt your enjoyment of the season even more so than for a normal season by spoiling the winner for yourself. IMO Palau more than any other season benefits from going in blind. The premerge stuff from Ulong is a lot less interesting if you already know theyre going to lose every time and the postmerge is definitely less interesting if you know Tom wins. Tom is almost the perfect archetypal example of the kind of guy who gets blindsided in the earlymid merge for being too big of a threat and the surprise that he manages to prevent that and survive to the end is one of the best parts of the season IMO. ,survivor,da7td8o,4,t5_2qhu3

It helped make the show immensely popular. The scene you describe was one such example of that. I understand why it might have stood out since this season in particular has been really light on the nonstrategy scenes. That scene shows how Hannah has grown over the season to have the courage or confidence to even talk to someone who looks like Ken and would normally intimidate her and it also once again shows how genuine and kind Ken is despite how one might perceive him based solely on appearances. tldr Character development.

9835728,0,t1_dapk0x0,Experiences and events WILL shift thoughts and opinions during the game and that is inevitable but their pregame speeches of strategy talk is all we have on the basis of their understanding of survivor before the game begins. A mere when I hit the beach strategy does not dictate what survivor means to each castaway and those who view in a very strategic light are obviously more likely to see it as a game. So when I say that Im not a fan of the double standard in certain castaways votes its because it seems that they came in with the view that survivor was a strategy game and through the experience regressed into voting on a strict personal basis something Im sure they would not have liked had the roles been reversed. I agree with you in saying that watching survivor and playing survivor are on opposite ends of a spectrum and having starved for X many days only to be voted out by your best friend can be heart breaking. However it can be frustrating to watch other people hold their competitors responsible for things that they were also completely ok with doing during the game. That is why I am confused about castaways who vote this way despite their previous words and actions. Also as a fan I like to discuss things like this with other fans its a part of following survivor. Never said I was sending a petition to CBS to have a revote for their nd season simply had a thought on the game I enjoyed watching and decided to share it with other people.

The problem is that people who get voted out early usually have major flaws in the way they approach the game even if they appear to be a threat.I think the better move is to bring back very promising early boots even maybe a first boot in an allreturnee season along with people who went much farther people like Brice Anna Tracy Marissa etc. who have the potential to be great players but werent able to show their full potential.

I dont know that Hannah isnt a geek because we never see all of a person on the show but the personality of the character we have been shown is definitely distinctively dorky.

Varner and Ozzy collectively get the most screentime.. Aubry severely underperforms.. Ciera Michaela Debbie and Malcom all get invisible edits at the start of the season.. Zeke and Tai align.. Return of the voting blocs but Ozzy will suck and try to force everyone into an alliance.. Troyzan actually has a chance at winning and gets a positive edit.. Brad Culpepper leaves within the first  days.. Andrea will be portrayed as a major player despite not doing anything original.. Debbie and Malcom will align and go against Ozzy.. Ciera will attempt to get people to draw rocks when shes in the minority and has zero chance at getting anywhere.. Cirie is a puzzle beast and gets kept around until at least the swap. However she never gets a chance to make a big move.. Someone tries to form an all female alliance which nobody else wants to take part of Im thinking Hali.. At max  people speak at the reunion..

10050072,0,t3_5jm9ws,WilburDes sums it up nicely.Id say overall provided you have the time its worth watching. The host Jonathan LaPaglia does a pretty solid job as a Jeffsubstitute. I also enjoyed the music which generally uses epic music as in the epic genre. I even knew some of the tracks used by TSFH rather than the type of music youd hear on US Survivor. I really enjoyed the music but Im sure others prefer the more traditional music. The season definitely has its ups and downs though. My somewhat fuzzy opinions on itI dont remember the early game too well it was a lot of episodes ago! but I feel like I was a bit indifferent towards it I dont remember it being either exceptional or boring but I enjoyed it well enough and there are some funinteresting twists but after the second swap it got really good for the remainder of the premerge.Then the merge hits. And that was a bit of a drag. Youll see if you watch it and I dont think this is really much of a spoiler but Ill black it out anyways mateship is a big thing for many of these Aussie Survivors. Strategy is evil according to a handful of themspoiler. I feel like I kept watching just to finish what Id already started.But the thing that will always get me is the finale. The episode made all the stuff before it worth it to me. I was expecting to not enjoy the episode at all with who was left and what the FIC was previewed to be the classic Borneo handonidol challenge. I can appreciate it but its just not what I hope forspoiler. But I was absolutely blown away. The setting the spoilery stuff the emotions  it was fantastic IMO.

10066401,0,t1_dbjkuvs,This season features two returning players one of whom originally played on  and  and the other on  and . Make sure to watch those first before watching this one.There are plenty of legitimate knocks against this season it mostly revolves around the same four players all of whom are very polarizing there is a lot of tediousness and contrived suspense and lots of characters are essentially ignored. But it also features some of the darkest and most sociologically intriguing stuff the show has ever seen especially towards the end. It doesnt hurt that I am an absolutely humungous fan of this seasons winner and literally everything they say and do. Lots of people find the dark stuff more uncomfortable than intriguing and I cant say blame them and while the winner is mostly very popular most people dont tend to think they redeem the season quite as much as I do. In any case though Id say its head and shoulders above the rest of the unholy trinity of  and you should definitely try to keep an open mind about watching it.Rank ,survivor,dbjobfj,7,t5_2qhu3

10163592,0,t3_5lin4m,I liked Brad as a character in BvW for the reasons you say but as a returning player pick hes baffling. As far as I can tell theres absolutely nothing good we could get out of him in another season that we didnt get already because he was already a satisfying premerge villain. Plus in Blood vs. Water his story was really enhanced by some of the stuff he said about trying to play for Monica and trying to be her shield but ending up as an anchor and while I still didnt care for the RI scenes of people who had been voted out yelling at him most people did and at any rate it clearly made him a more effective character. None of that will be present in the next season.So basically if he goes out early it might be fun but itll still almost certainly be a rerun of the story weve already seen but with a lot less going on and a lot less value and if he does go far despite being kinda a chode itll be annoying.

It can be pretty boring for one person to dominate challenges. The reason for making everyone draw rocks except those who were in trouble is to deter them from tying. Its more of a form of punishment and the reason people decide to go to rocks is that if it works out your alliance can gain majority.

10305271,0,t1_dcc59o2,Yes I would say that would be better because it shows they actually could win some challenges. Losing so many in a row makes it clear that losing a returnee caused them enough damage that they couldnt even win challenges. Especially when you look at the fact that if they hadnt thrown the challenge they probably would have gone  in challenges with Russells help. But once they lost Russell the survival aspect of the game really hurt them because as first timers they couldnt compete with a group that included a returnee who knew how to play the survival part of the game and kept them strong enough for challenges.It seems people in this subreddit forget that Survivor has a survival aspect to the game still and experience is a huge boost in this part of the game.

He started his game by aligning with a power couple and even after his closest ally Taylor started participating in gameending food theft buffoonery he stuck with him. Every time he was immune postmerge he essentially had the attitude that he could do nothing at that point instead of trying to build up strategic relationships while he was safe to carry him further.

10475147,1,t1_dcvg1xp,lemme try. I think Ciries first game is MUCH better than Parvatis first. Their second games are pretty closely linked. Parvati gets the win but I dont feel like that automatically makes her a better player than Cirie unless you believe that all winners are king and that if Bob were on HvV he should be above Cirie. WHICH is a belief system I can respect. So I would just say I weigh a players first trip much more than returning trips.  I mean Russell beats Tom Westman head to head in HvV so I dont know about that line of argument. Its close though can see why people would say Parvati.,survivor,dcvgswd,5,t5_2qhu3

10505589,0,t1_dcywpsx,I think it is about  to which of Jerri or Parvati would win.  I certainly wouldnt bet money on the winner and I bet real money on my favorite sports regularly and do quite well I might point out.  Parvati would probably have to get  of Amanda or Candice to win which wouldnt be easy as we both know how much ridiculous bitterness and disdain each had for Parvati.   Lets first cover the obvious votes for each though. It is hard to see Coach voted Parvati over Sandra and respected her game highly but Jerri was his closest ally and the only one who didnt betray him on his blindside Colby or probably even J.T not voting Jerri.  Rupert Courtney Danielle definitely vote Parvati IMO.   So we are at  with Sandra Candice Amandas votes remaining.  Sandras vote is up in the air so Parvati would need atleast  of Amanda or Candice and possibly both depending on how Sandra votes.  I would have assumed Sandra voting Parvati except that she claims she would have voted Jerri so who knows on her but either way Amanda and Candice the two most bitter people towards Parvati probably decide things.  The good news for Parvati is Amanda and Candice didnt like Jerri much completely unlike Sandra who they liked alot but still it wouldnt be easy to pull those needed votes.   ,survivor,dcyx4sc,4,t5_2qhu3

There are characters I hated or didnt care about the first time I watched certain seasons but after a rewatch I decided to pay more attention to them to make a final decision about my opinion. I also try to enjoy the little things pretty much like the second or third time you watch a movie and instead of trying to understand you start seeing details or quotes or things you might have missed. It happened to me with certain seasons like The Australian Outback or Heroes vs Villains which is not an old season but has a lot of comical value. Finally I try to pay more attention to the shots of nature.

And then bring her back as soon as you can.While S was on the air Ami was the first clear star of the show post S in which lots of the previous All Stars were taken down a peg.

While Samoa was Samoan themed HvV was expanded to Polynesian themed with Hawaiian influences seen in the tribal immunity idol and Maori culture reflected in the hidden idols and immunity necklace. But SoPa was a melange of Polynesian and Melanesian cultures recycling propsstatuettes from past seasons to just generally be South Pacific themed. And then the art direction of One World was themed after a Maori tribe who would use bones for spiritual purposes. So yeah its now easier for vague tribal themes to pass over standout history themes such as Pirates.,survivor,ddbdj7w,8,t5_2qhu3

10676119,0,t1_ddgiis3,The problem I have with even labelling him a GREAT strategic player is on both his seasons he made blatantly wrong decisions who to bring to the end.  Natalie instead of Jaison on Samoa and that is assuming he couldnt have even brought one or both of Shambo and Fincher to the end if he wanted which if he had as much control as he supposably had he could have and if he couldnt have it means his control was exagerrated in the first place.  And on Heroes and Villians he jettisons his  best goats Candice and Danielle early in the merge and also in such ugly fashion he renders himself a jury vote who couldnt win against anyone and insists on taking the biggest jury threat in the whole game to the end SANDRA.   Even on Samoa he wanted to take Brett to the end and vote out Mick and Natalie was able to talk him out of it which in fact saved her own win.  The same way Parvati might have saved her win had she been able to talk Russell into not taking Sandra to the end but unlike Natalie with Brett failed to do so.   He is utterly delusional on his choice of final opponents and what juries look for.  To me that goes beyond his already bad social play and is questionable strategy too.,survivor,ddh5t7e,1,t5_2qhu3

Hopefully only if you dig deep into the material and read the attached eagleeyed comments.The mods here are great at squashing spoilery threads and the edgic tags are a good policy that almost everyone adheres to but there will always be little comments sprinkled around that can tip you off and are impossible to police. Like Skinny Kelley Michele edgic or the betting odds for Australian Survivor.

10754378,0,t1_ddp5ugi,gt Its either that or they dont get to play at all? Which would you rather have? If youre asking me whether Id rather have had AllStars or not on balance reflecting on that season alone rather than its effects on subsequent seasons the answer is no I would rather not have had AllStars.  I would rather have had AllStars one season cycle later as I would rather have had this season at least one cycle later instead.  gtIts basically impossible to schedule a season with  of the most wanted returners of all time. HvV had two truly questionable choices in a Final  season.  This cast has like seven to nine depending on who youre asking.  Its not an impossible task to get a better balance than GC has given adequate time and planning.gtIt was either bring in a couple of underwhelming contestants or just cancel the returnee season.Yes that sounds great to me thats pretty much what a lot of us have been saying.  Its not like we were all dying for one we had one in the last season cycle.  Even the casual fans I know my family mostly think its way too soon.  If the underwhelming people run the show which is quite likely simply given their numbers and the massive targets on the backs of a couple of the big names this season is going to be received very poorly by everyone and it will have been in many ways a waste of potential to bring any of these big names back at all especially since many of them likely would not return yet again.  And thats time and resources that could have been spent finding great new characters and stories.,survivor,ddp8dvf,7,t5_2qhu3

Also  people didnt quit survivor even if they have less rewards. Everyone is sort of lonely because they are on an island with strangers that want to vote them out.

Or having chosen Tina doing a pisspoor job of wooing Jerri back to voting for him because not like she liked Tina that much either. Kim idk...not flipping at the F? Dont think she wins in any FTC setup. Maybe against Frank? Neleh Not owning up to her move at F to vote out John. Poorly answering his and Roberts questions and losing their votes they went in leaning her. Clay Being lazy and alienating all of Jan Helen and Ted? Matthew Not sure dont think he beats anyone. Maybe if he voted out Rob instead of Butch and didnt throw the FIC? Good chance Jenna still wins that though. I think he was drawing dead. Lil Not get voted out? She was never gonna win. Rob Voting outblindsiding Tom. Hed already pissed off Lex and Alicia who would be angry no matter what and I think would have voted Amber regardless due to Australia ties so Tom is really the nail in his coffin. Betraying JennaRupert had far fewer risks behind it as both ultimately voted Rob anyway. Twila Not simply turning on the women but swearing on his son belittling Eliza the entire game and being unapologetic about it. Had she played differently I think she could have used girl power to at least sway LeeAnn or Julie back since she successfully got Ami back at FTC. Katie Lordy I dont think theres a way Katie win. Sorry I love Katie but when your only option is Caryn I dont see a realistic pathone move that cost her. I think even an Ian who betrays Tom at F and takes her still wins but that might be the only scenario. Idk. Stephanie Voting out Judd arguably Jamie but that had more support behind it. Betraying her close allies JuddCindy back to back basically cost Steph any chance of winning. Danielle Not sure but probably voting out Courtney and decisively siding with the CirieAras faction on Casaya. Debateable whether she wins and Shane wanted her out anyway so she had to go with the  plan so she pretty much had zero options to win. Ok thats a lot and I gotta get to class but Ill try to come back later and do more. With the rise of the F and multirunners up it becomes a lot more work but this is a fun exercise in game theory. ,survivor,dekp7xf,3,t5_2qhu3

11089774,0,t1_deozgnr,First off I do believe Tony screwed up. I think he had a  chance going into this season and he brought that down to a . chance. So sure fundamentally I guess I agree that he screwed up. Where it looks like we differ is that I really dont think his screw up was the reason he went home. I think it was just genuinely in the best interests of everyone in that alliance ironically except Sandra to vote him out when they did.gt Sandra had nearly as many prevotes against her as he did and a lot of people also saying they were intimidated by how clear it was that Sandra was already sizing people up.Agreed. Its why I think Sandra is in HUGE trouble going forward. gt Im not saying that alliance was airtight rock solid right out of the gate but that doesnt change the fact that there was some kind of working relationship there that he threw out the windowNeither am I. Sure there was potential for SOMETHING. But again my argument is that that particular alliance was not in the best interest of Malcolm Caleb and Aubry BEFORE Tony ever blew anything up and thats why they voted against him. It sound like you believe that his boot was solely a result of his antics during the game and I believe that his antics didnt make a sliver of a difference. But I think to suggest that he was fine up to that point is to look at S Tonys chances with rose colored glasses. gt to deny that is to essentially say that multiple different people were lying in their confessionals just because you dont want to believe Tony screwed up.Is it lying if I say that I can either vote for Tony or Sandra. It makes sense for me to vote out Tony because X. It makes sense to vote out Sandra because Y? No theyre giving the editors what they wantwhich is the ability to tailor a narrative to the vote. Michaela saying I hate losing and I want to keep the tribe strong doesnt mean shes lying if she votes in a way that  seemingly goes against that. Theres the game and then theres the game playing to the editors and answering in a very particular way in confessionals. I believe Michaela and Caleb were playing the game when they gave their confessionals.tldr Tony screwed up but it didnt matter anyway.,survivor,dep0lei,1,t5_2qhu3

11090878,1,t3_5yd7iy,Honestly Im impressed Tony was even able to survive one tribal council. I really think he is actually such a skilled player he just went in with a bigger target than anyone has ever went into a game with. You can really see his infectionous personality as most of the castaways seemed to love him even though they voted him out. Caleb was his biggest hater in the preseason amp Tony ended up being Calebs best friend on the island. He really didnt play a bad game. Although he did overplay a little I think he was hit by Sandra playing an awful game. She isnt doing what got her the  wins in the st place.

But Im not afraid anymore of taking risks so I feel perfectly find about my chances of finding the idol.Gandhi Afternoon Catherine. Catherine Hey Gandhi. Hows it going?Gandhi Cant complain really. Where is everyone? Catherine Ah theyre just out and about. I think Shaka went fishing. Gandhi Again? We have plenty of food. Catherine I think its more for him to cool down after the reward fiasco.Gandhi Makes sense. How are you doing? I know you were part of said fiasco.Gandhi I honestly couldnt care about what Catherines dealing with. It justdoesnt interest me. Catherine YeahI was. Let me tell you it was not pleasant. Gandhi I can only imagine.Gandhi And dont get the wrong idea Im not turning into a sociopath or anything I just dont care about some petty fight that Catherine had. Thats just boring. Catherine Dido is just so annoying!! I cannot stand her arrogance! I just wish we could vote her out already!!! Gandhi We will. Dont worry. Look forget about Dido ok? Shes just jealous of you. Gandhi Catherines story may be a waste of my time but that doesnt mean I cant take advantage of it. If I can get her and Dido to target each other tonight well that would just be fantastic.Catherine Jealous? Gandhi Yeah jealous. She doesnt have close friendships like you and I have. Shes just bitter.Catherine Thatseems kind of farfetched. I dont think Dido would be jealous of me. Gandhi Hey Im just telling you what I observe. Would I lie to you? Catherine No you wouldnt. Gandhi Exactly. Believe me Dido isnt worth it. Catherine Youre right. She isnt. Gandhi But I will sayand I wasnt going to say thisbut she did say some unsavory remarks earlier today.Catherine What unsavory remarks? Gandhi leans in and whispers in her ear. Catherine gasps in shock and then her eyes narrow in angerCatherine That bitchGandhi Are you ok?Catherine Not anymore.Gandhi So what would you like to do?Catherine Shes going down. Gandhi Perfect. Catherine Dido and I have never gotten along. Up until today though I just considered it to be a normal rivalry. I never took it personally until today at the reward when she personally attacked me. There was no reason to do thatshe was just being a bully and now to hear this from Gandhi. I have lost all respect for her not only as a player but also as a person. Gandhi Meh they already hated each other. A confrontation was bound to happen sooner or later so I merely decided to help them along. They should be grateful in all honesty because now they will both be completely open to each other. Catherine Listen um. Im going to go for a walk. Do you want to come? Two sets of eyes are better than one.Gandhi Thank you but I think Ill stay here. Idol hunting isnt my cup of tea. Catherine All right. Ill see you later then.Gandhi Sounds good. Catherine Oh and Gandhi? Gandhi Yes?Catherine Thank you for being honest with meand for supporting me. Youre a real friend. Gandhi Its no problem. Good luck hunting!Catherine Im really happy Ive been able to reconnect with Gandhi. We were allies back on Belulchad but I worried that swap might drive us apart.Gandhi That was disturbingly easy. If this is the biggest challenge that Im going to have then this game is mine. Chaos will reign and Ill be a million dollars richer.Catherine As of right now I consider him to be my closest ally. Hes the one person I feel that I can completely rely on that I know I can beat at the end because well Gandhi doesnt really do anything game wise. Catherine Im grateful for what Nebby did I really am but Im not stupid. Ill fill my debt and Ill stay loyal to him for now but I will have to cut him and Sejong towards the end.

11115987,0,t1_derr6wx,Thats very true and I completely agree.  Those things need to be taken into account when deciding how successful a player is.I dont agree that last boot is inherently better than a losing finalist because there have been multiple circumstances that dont really represent that on Survivor.As an example I consider Stephen a better player than Erinn.  I consider Aubry a better player than Cydney who the jury seemed to loathe because the losing finalist can still have a better chance of winning than the last boot.  Being the last boot means you either didnt have the relationships you needed to or didnt hide your threat level well enough.  Those are flaws as well you cant win the game if you cant get to the final .  I consider Adam an amazing winner because he calculated it so perfectly where he had  people in front of him that were larger jury threats than him and  players that would most likely lose to him.  He planned it out so so well in that regard.Spencer could have won at F for sure.  He wins against Abi and Tasha but he swiveled the wrong way.  He was the youngest player amongst a very older jury so that wasnt helpful.,survivor,derzkmz,2,t5_2qhu3

If JT had stuck to the plan he wouldve proven loyalty his ally would still be with him and he could convert on advantages last episode and in the future. But he tried to play too soon. I know Im simplifying a lot and a sharper person than I could write a whole thesis on JT I really believe that but I think we saw that JT is unable to setup advantages that he can convert later.

11402325,0,t1_dfoay1g,All that was was Debbie proving a point that Hali was no better than her in challenges. Look it at from her persepctive. Shes the oldest female out there and Im sure that makes her feel insecure as the older women are usually viewed as dead weight and useless. Coupled with that she perceives that one of her closest allies has kicked her to the curb in favour of a younger fitter model and has betrayed her trust and loyalty. This is her Koah Rong game all over again when her closest ally turned on her. Of course her emotions are going to be heightened and shes going to be even more frazzled. Could she have handled it better of course she could have but shes tired vulnerable and starving.As for Brad Tai confirmed some of Debbies beef regarding him. Brad looks down on Debbie and treats her like she doesnt matter. Hes confirmed as much in his bonus confessionals. Debbie doesnt deal well with macho arrogant bossy men. She had problems with Peter Scot amp Jason. As for Brad he didnt manage her at all. She now sees him as a target. If hes this lousy placating a close ally this early heaven help him later on with even more paranoia in the mix.,survivor,dfoftpx,1,t5_2qhu3

There are scientific studies showing the differences in perceptions between WoC and white women as well as WoC and men. Where are you drawing your belief that race isnt a factor from?

11451573,0,t3_63gs2e,I find Adams prediction for how the two sides would most likely breakdown at a merge to be quite interestingOn one side he puts Andrea Brad FFSDT Ozzy Zeke  Aubry ditching her original Mana tribe matesOn the other he puts Hali Sandra Troyzan Varner  Cirie and Sarah ditching their original Nuku tribe matesHe then positions Debbie as a swing vote. Of course the merge is not happening tomorrow night so how things shake out is more unpredictable potential flippers may stay with their original tribes depending on whom they end up on a team with. Here I would just like to add a few points to his breakdown and also nuance a few a bit differently According to JT both Andrea and Cirie were on the outs on the original Nuku tribe. While this may have changed I do wonder why Adam keeps Andrea on the side with Brad and co. when Andrea would be more likely to go with Cirie if they secure the s. Since Debbie now appears to loathe Brad and since she has said in an online confessional that she is tightest with Sarah Debbie would presumably go with Sarah if the latter decided to flip especially if it meant she could enact her revenge plot against Brad. Aubry is in a particular pickle. Does she really want to align again with Tai? Perhaps out of expediency but she should be wary of doing so since Tai does hold some animositydistrust towards her. Worse of course is if Debbie remains a part of the original Nuku tribe alliance. Aubry may have no choice but to stay with Sandra and company for now and hope to develop bonds across tribal lines during the swap and at the merge. Poor Aubry. She seems to have little wiggle room no matter which way she turns.  Is it actually possible that Sandra and Cirie will come together as a voting bloc and work together to take out their enemies? This seems an unlikely scenario  but it sure would be AWESOME. ,survivor,dfu0yzg,4,t5_2qhu3

11483205,0,t1_dfxly0r,Idk. I think the idea behind it is very good but I think they rushed into it. It also sucks that it was Debbie that went. While we got some funny character moments the purpose of it was for the player to do some objective strategy talk and fine tune moving forward. If we got Zeke Aubry or Andrea it would have been fantastic because they all are big strategists. We would have some some fun nerdy moments and lots of intense strategy talk thAt would be beneficial!Ozzy would have been really great because of the reversal of Ozzy being the teacher in South Pacific etc. Cochran knows Ozzy well and would have been able to offer great advice for a difficult time of the game for OzzyAnd Sandra.

Even someone like Tina who had a quiet edit her first time around and was voted out first her second time only got far because of Redemption Island because people know better than to let her slip past.

He deserves every bit of what those around him and who knows him are going to think and do about him now. Thats something I hope he would embrace and learn from.    But hes getting relentless shit now from a faceless hoard that he has limited ability to interact with. Thats not condusive to him learning anything. Its just an angry mob thats not helping anyone. He could completely acknowledge being  wrong and truly grow as a person which those in his life would see and react to. But the mob wont.    Not to get too hyperbolic but its like the difference in the justice system between punishment and rehabilitation. Do you want to make a person and the world better and more tolerant?

11619434,0,t1_dgczkfc,When something horrific has been done to you its possible to have conflicting feelings without being twofaced. There are many reasons to want to forgive someone who has wronged you and many reasons to find it difficult to do so. From Zekes THR column When he pulled me in for a hug I felt compelled to reciprocate both as a sign that I was willing to forgive him and that the shots he had fired missed. But if were being perfectly honest with one another Ive struggled with that forgiveness in the months following. I cant foresee us sipping martinis together in Fire Island. While I can reconcile the personal slight of him outing me I continue to be troubled by his willingness to deploy such a dangerous stereotype on a global platform. But forgiveness does not require friendship. Forgiveness does not require forgetting or excusing his actions. Forgiveness requires hope. Hope that he understands the injury he caused and does not inflict it upon others. Hope that whatever torments his soul will plague him no more. I have hope for Jeff Varner. I just choose to hope from afar thank you very much.,survivor,dgd2nto,24,t5_2qhu3
11619922,0,t1_dgd42vm,But it was Probst who decided not to do a vote. Everyone was highly emotional but if they had waiting a little longer they could have gotten everyone to calm down probably considering Zeke was totally calm. They could have left it out and edited it a way to make it seem less dramatic. I know it was probably heat of the moment type stuff but its not like it was broadcasted live on tv. It was only a few people there that didnt know so it was not until it aired that millions found out. I dont think that this was done for ratings but I feel like there was a way this could have been fealty with better or maybe not its just so crazy what happened.Varner obviously didnt realize that Zeke wasnt out in the real world. It was sort of like Shrodingers outing. It was only a mistake until the episode aired and once it did then Zeke was outed to the whole world.

Next week you all get to go back to the next episode and leave this behind but well still have to be trans in an oftenhostile world so many of us may have different perspectives. I know this will sound harsh to many of you and many of us trans folks will have varying opinions about this but please try to keep in mind that to many trans people again the people who would know it best outing someone publicly like that is an act of violence and only contributes to many of the difficulties and dangers we face.

Besides the strategy being way beyond anything anyone thought of until off the top of my head Ciries  plan nine seasons later Frank is the last guy who would vote out Big Tom when he could take out Brandon especially since Brandon was gunning for him.If it did happen I dont think it would change much because Brandon would just do what he did to Kelly. The next tribal would be three Samburu and three Boran with Brandon in the middle and Brandon would side with his new best buddy Lex instead of working with Frank. So even with Big Tom gone Frank would still go home at that spot unless Samburu and BoranminusLex team up to take out Brandon again.Maybe with Frank gone Brandon would go back to TBird and Kim P. at the Final  but I think its way more likely that one of those two goes out next.

11666793,0,t1_dgi60s8,Excellent response. I think this was exactly what Sophie Clarke was getting at in one of her RHAP podcasts for MvGX when she admitted that she didnt particularly care for the superduper fans and their meta way of playing Survivor. There is too much awareness with such players of themselves as characters and how they need to participate in the shaping of their charactersarchetypes there is too much awareness with such players of the viewing audience and not enough on the other players who will make up the jury and who will decide who wins and who loses. It reminds me too of something Max Dawson said during his exit press for Worlds Apart he was far too awareeager to give the producers what they wanted or what he thought they wanted instead of focusing on playing the game of Survivor. Play the game of Survivor and leave the rest to the producerseditors. And if you think that giving the producers what they want is the correct way to play the game just rewatch WA and the way the producerseditors made Max look like a fool.,survivor,dgig2qb,5,t5_2qhu3

He has fair competition from Tai Brad and apparently Andrea in the challenges his main strategy is catching fish and he seems very loyal. People should be more scared of those who are willing to do anything for their resume even make stupid moves and who are good at influencing others and establishing good courses of action.

Like you even said Cirie acknowledges that Michaela has a lot to work on if she wants to do well in Survivor but she also recognizes that Michaela needs to work on herself in a certain way which is undeniably related to her race. Cirie and Michaela both said things along these lines in confessionals. Many white people in America are to varying degrees predisposed to not trust black people and think negatively of them patterns of segregation which still exist today in many metro areas has a big part in this. But my point is its possible that Michaela needs to work on her personality AND its possible that people like Sierra and JT can be interpreting Michaelas personality a certain way due to her race and I think at least JTs comments about her support this theory.,survivor,dgle9b2,6,t5_2qhu3

Malcolm this year played around with the same general schtick. But those players can call Survivor a game of chess and express interest in slaughtering their enemies and theyre funny and lighthearted but clearly Zeke wants to literally bathe in the blood of his enemies because contestants never speak in hyperbole for fun. Youre still being incredibly selective. Zeke has a number of lighthearted playful confessionals and some but not all are clearly joking in tone. Plus this season he was giddy to play alongside his favorites because hes a longtime fan. And have we really already forgotten his legendary B roll? And I dont understand how you can honestly say that taking a game for a million dollars even if the show itself is silly and sometimes dumb too seriously is a bad thing.

11760942,0,t1_dgt428a,If I remember correctly according to Michaela herself in the first couple of days on S nobody talked to her except Jay that says a lot about Jays great social game she was also on the outs with majority conversations. Then they had this major evac because of the storm they stayed together in a room. People started to see Michaelas goofy side and started to like her more. I think the problem with Michaela this season is that shes probably more tired and more intense and more unapprochoable because of last seasons blindside. Or because going to more TCs this season made her more paranoid alsoIf she could loose up a bit and show her funsunny side people will start to like her also. As a viewer I think S Michaela is more funsunny than S Michaela,survivor,dgt4rze,9,t5_2qhu3

11762727,0,t1_dgt92ss,I am really enjoying her gameplay this season. Forget all the flipping  its her social game that deserves immense credit. Even with her playing both sides shes still the  ally of tons of players and that says to me that she really has learned her mistakes from Cagayan she can play the swing subtly and effectively. I think this move was the right option for her. She has relationships with Aubry Zeke and Cirie alongside players on the opposite side who still like her so she very much has options. Meanwhile I seriously doubt she was F like Sierra suggested and when Debbie started leaking info about Sarah I think it was the right move to flip.Then we still havent talked about her advantage or helping Cirie! Helping Cirie helps build trust in that relationship which will help her on that side of the numbers whilst finding that advantage just shows how she was paying attention and has her gameface on more than can said of Michaela who completely ignored it.My only worry comes from Andreas talk of Shes the swing and she knows it or something like that. This highlights that people see her as that swing and she could be veering back towards Cagayan Sarah she needs to handle that situation as delicately as possible. But I seriously think that she has the personal relationships to navigate past it. Shes in good with players on both sides and shes seen as the closest ally of many of them. If shes going to play the flipping game she will need as many of those relationships as possible. Definite upvote and she is  PotW for me.,survivor,dgtc1rs,25,t5_2qhu3
