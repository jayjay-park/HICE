5785338,0,t3_3ucbid,I count different factory signs manufacturer signs as being different for the reason that I see it as a collecting challenge. Suppose a cap is printed for  years. The pattern is the same for the whole time but the factory sign changes after  and  years meaning there are now  versions of the cap to collect. I see it as a challenge to collect all  because if you can do it that is proof that you paid that close attention to the cap over the course of  years in order to seek out each cap.I own these  Turkish caps. They all vary by factory sign except for the  mosas caps which vary by coulouration. Having these  together is like completing a puzzle imo.,BottleCapCollecting,cxe85rk,2,t5_2uzuw
