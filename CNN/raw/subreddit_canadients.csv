213938,0,t1_cf2rog4,That is an excellent argument. They will eventually address that as soon as it becomes too overwhelming to ignore. Theyll have the media do a piece about how teachers cant recognize the packaging from a sandwich wrap and police cant enforce the laws and then  theyll react in the only way they can in order to quell this new public uprising theyve created the appearance of and everyone will feature a common chip. This BS system cant work without it and that was obvious from the onset as well. But they had to sell it first. Corporate weed at predatory and punitive recreational prices masquarading as a medical system that leaves a gun to the heads of med users who will have no choice but to support it because remember it only gets worseTM bully govnmtThis MMPR is now in a full on race with the economic action plan as harpers most substantive retooling effort and let it be known will and is suffer the very same delusional enforced optimism. Alternatively theyll simply give everyone a fine by default and you can go prove your innocence in court but it will probably just be easier to pay it. Dont we want to be taxed for it anyway. PS Its these arguments where were left vulnerable to their marketing in place of the critical standardizations they promised that portray an industry with momentum towards monopoly that it isnt even impressed with the governments regulatory gift of one. The beauty of it is that as a med user I have no inclination towards playing with that meatgrinder. Yet with the gun placed to my temple if I dont Im given no alternative to feed the beast one way or the other they will have our bones. A right to life and liberty means a right to opt the fuck out of this kind of corrupted self interested chinesebear trap. ,canadients,cf2t8zz,2,t5_2t7is

Im sure you have a tremendous glass collection to prove me wrong as well.The reason that you had to include such a disclaimer of not minding it is because you know its to be minded as a degraded product. People do not mind garbage when they dont know better or its all they can get their hands on and it is better than nothing.The mentality behind that pervasive to the MMPR that their milled trash is good enough for discounting to the destitute and therefore compassionate is tragic.

If you have to worry so much that your kids arent safe then you probably arent either so you shouldnt be doing it. Plenty of people are processing BHO everyday and not causing explosions. Edit Just want to clarify for anyone reading that theres no safe way to make BHO indoors without equipment that costs thousands of dollars.

Hes attended all major cannabis events and protests put money into the industry via sponsorships and employment forged many partnerships sold many people and businesses their first bongs and first seeds when access was hard to come by gave many writers photographers editors and designers a voice in the cannabis industry for decades before anyone else was doing that.He spent months behind bars for trafficking because he passed a joint to someone He was extradited by our government and spent half a decade behind bars in America in the name of cannabis. Hes started multiple political parties in the name of cannabis heres another and another opened an opiate addiction treatment centre plus garnered huge amounts of media in the name of cannabis.Hes dedicated his very livelihood to cannabis and... at least for me... earned himself the selfpromotion.,canadients,d4emujf,6,t5_2t7is

If you find a  THC Pink Kush AAA quality and a AAAA  Pink Kush  they will be comparable in strength and potency. We could go deeper and say that each may have a different terpene profile different phenotype etc. But at the end of the day extremely subjective system. But you need to ask yourself why you consume cannabis and what you want to get out of it. If you are medical and just need THC CBD etc then really the actual bag appeal and quality of aesthetics really mean nothing.

9449615,1,t1_d9dsrpq,When youre using large amounts being medical is beneficial not only in the stress reduction no more worries about getting caught even if all they do is confiscate your weed but financially. When you are a medical user your marijuana your Vape etc. are all taxdeductible medical expenses. If youre thinking of somebody whos getting  g a day thats an ounce a week at compassionate pricing so roughly  a week g based on Auroras compassionate pricing plus tax.  x. A year just for the herb.  Throw in a Vape thats another  replacing parts etc. adds up over the course of the year.I based this on compassionate pricing because someone going through an experience like this is very likely on long term disability or is in the low income range and the final annual figure is pretty much the  least a medical marijuana user dealing with serious issues would spend over the course of a year.

The updated ACMPR form asks if you will need to purchase seedclones from an LP and has a YesNo option.   Health Canada when pressed on lack of access and patients using dispensaries etc didnt say dont do it they said they would never advise or instruct patients to do it. Saying dont do itcant do it would have opened them up for another court challenge.  With legalization there will be regulations that current growersbreeders cant even imagine. Existing seed breeding regulations in place on agricultural operations will apply.A more detailed example based on US cases would be everything from breeding regulations to zoning of outdoor production.  Oregon has been getting more and more regulation on the books for both hemp and high THCweed farmers. Something like km minimum is now required between any of the two operations to prevent hemp being grown for grain from pollinating hemp being grown for seed stock or from pollinating weed being grown for consumption or seed stock. Like wise those growing weed  have to ensure the same distance is met in their license applications so that the do not contaminate hemp fields with weed pollen which would result in an above .

Full disclosure TD is my go to MoM and I might sound biased  because I am The reason I want to share this experience is because for the first time Ive had a package go missing for a few days. Ive been ordering a while now and I also work in shipping so I could tell right away that something was up with the original shipment from the tracking details. It hadnt left BC in  full days and I knew it wouldnt make it here on time for when I needed it to be here. IMMEDIATELY TD had assured me that if this went lost for longer than  more day they would fully replace my order. Hearing that set my mind at ease as Ive never had this happen before and I was unsure what would happen next. On the th day the package still remained in BC and past its expected delivery date. I messaged TD letting them know it hadnt arrived and they very promptly gave me the option of a refund or they could overnight me my exact same order. I chose to accept the overnight delivery as I really wanted this order and they really came through in big way. The order arrived the next morning safe and sound. I have no idea if this a policy used by other MoMs as well but I really feel they went above and beyond to replace my order and get it to me so quickly. Top notch customer service cant say enough about them. Ordering  Typical orderingsign up procedure as any other site.  with proof of ID. Communication This is where I feel TD really shines. Ive been ordering from them a while now and I never have to worry about my money the product or when it is shipping. Everything is completed in a timely manner with emails all along the way. And in particular to my latest order all of their replies to me were super fast and timely. Packaging Expresspost envelope vacuum sealed and then sealed again with another nontransparent shipping bag. ProductPrice Ive yet to be disappointed. Their Black Tuna is some of the best Ive ever had period and their prices seem to be lower than anyone Ive seen.  Incentivized? NoOh also one last note. Before I placed this order I sent them an email asking what their best sleep aid indica was because what I usually get was sold out on the site. Their reply blew me away they recommended a strain that wasnt even on the site yet and told me to hold off until it became available. They could have peddled me any other strain on the site to get rid of it but instead asked me to wait a few hours. Top Notch. Period. Reviewed by usonicyouth,canadients,db3rlyy,7,t5_2t7is

A small amount of weed goes along way.I am not  sure that Im correct about the no smell requirements that is what I recall reading a year or so ago.

Perhaps figuring out how to apply a no safe drop option to the package. Or apply a signature option at the least. If you miss the package and cant sign for it then thats nobodys fault either.

Youre protected from arbitrary searches but the moment you have the words and symbols related and beyond that the smell and the paraphanelia Youve given reasonable suspicion of criminal behaviour and thus youre allowed to be searched and seized.,canadients,de2vjc3,1,t5_2t7is

I agree medically speaking the variation from grow to grow of cannabinoids and terpines in flowers can vary far to much to be used in a scientific environment when extraction can guarantee a product that is consistent enough to face replicable medical trials. My problem is her need to justify taxing medical users by stating concerns over tax dodging. I sense a lot of dishonesty in a lot of this. I strongly dislike the regulated market that is apparent vs. the one they claim to recommend. A majority of the health conscious approach down playing the revenue and jobs this market is going to create is flat out disingenuous without even having to go pointing at the time tested effects of lobby groups.Im completely for peoples recreationalholisticreligiousANY usage.

My family has a history of mental illness and addiction and Im aware of how easy it is for me to fall into abuse of damn near anything substance or activity that gives me pleasure or a moment of reprive from the stress I live with because of my own condition.Im fully aware of how insurance companies pharmaceutical producers and distributors and Canadian healthcare work.

Outside of the US many countries produce tons of hemp. Literally. Tens of thousands of metric tonnes a year. And heres the thing It hasnt radically shifted any of those industries there. They are largely used for specific specialty markets they arent replacing existing markets. And this isnt an issue of economies of scale. France produced almost  metric tonnes of hemp in . China pretty regularly produces in the tens of thousands of tonnes annually on average and have for decades. Hemp is a very useful crop and as it becomes more deregulated and commercially viable yes opportunities will increase. You can get seeds for food and for animal seed its a useful cover crop it can be used in many specialty products and has enormous potential for more environmentally sustainable products. But its not going to replace synthetic fabrics or cotton. Its not going to replace tree plantations for paper. The belief that it will radically displace existing industries is just not the reality.

The tests must also measure current impairment so tests cannot be administered days before a worker will be performing a safetyrelated task.That last part is the kicker there is no way to test for marijuana within a day or hours of consumption because it stays in your system for at least  weeks.

11610258,0,t1_dgc0i3t,I dont condone driving stoned either. Unless youre smoking bush league weed.  years for peddling dope to kids and major fines and possible jail time for driving stoned. It all depends on the severity of the case. I highly doubt theyre gonna toss folks in prison for simply just being a bit high while driving. But if youre fuckin mangled driving down the highway like a retard being a hazard on the road driving carelessly or what not then yeah common sense dictates you should have your license revoked at the very least. Thats how theyre going to handle this I foresee. If you cause an accident while impaired on pot youllprobly face the same penalties as if you had been drinking. Theyre both intoxicants. The only reason to be scared of the penalties is if you believe youll get one. In which case I think you better reevaluate your approach in how youre going to handle this upcoming new law pal. ,canadients,dgc172u,2,t5_2t7is

11645130,0,t1_dgfh9sp,gt A standardized behavioral test would be better. This is about making sure we actually catch people who are impaired not about raising the limit of impairment.While I agree that there is currently no science that can tell us how impared someone is but any sort of Standardized imparement test will never pass legal muster. There is no way that it can be proven that a Standardized impairment test hasnt been done with any sort of bias in mind. Thats why the laws have to be based on some sort of quantifiable number. Without that the only option that the law leaves is a zero tolerance policy IMHO. I dont like that idea but I dont think anyone will ever be able to create a test for impairment that isnt going to be biased in some way.I hope Im wrong but I just dont see how we can use anything other than BloodTHC levels as an indicator of legality to drive. ,canadients,dgfzmgm,1,t5_2t7is
