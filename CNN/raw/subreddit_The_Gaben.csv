10376127,0,t3_5olhj4,Hey Gabe and other members of the Valve team. Ive got a few questions mainly about Counter Strike Global Offensive.. Are there any plans to add  tick servers into Match Making in the near future?. Recently the term CSGOd has come about which is when you shoot someone in the head yet due to hit boxes it doesnt register. Will hit boxes be worked on further through the course of ?. Sometime around New Years the CSGO servers went out for around hrs with no official response from Valve throughout the whole time the servers were down. Will community management be improved through  and beyond?. In  will the VAC system work moreany better? Currently there are quite a few cheaters in CSGO. With there not being a banwave in while I think its time to improve the anti cheat to make a healthier game.. And one final nonCSGO questions do you have any plans for E this year?,The_Gaben,dck748w,1,t5_3ii9a

10376529,0,t3_5olhj4,Pleasure to see your answers Based GabeN!I have a few questions. Do you have any advice for newer studios on creating unique or as unique as possible games?. Do you think Valve will revamp Greenlight? The flood of games on Steam is looking like it can damage the importance of small studios getting on Steam and this could be a big issue long term.. Knowing support is an issue do you think a revamp to VAC bans will ever happen? The fact that VACs can affect other multiplayer games I.E. Rust servers not allowing VACCED players seems like it could throw thousands of dollars in the trash for some players. I think a  or  year period of fair play could be a good system to lift VACs. Just an idea.It should be noted I understand the importance of VAC bans but permaband that can affect other games seems like it could be too damaging.,The_Gaben,dck8rbo,1,t5_3ii9a
10376540,0,t3_5olhj4,Hi Gabe Id like to ask what is the future of TF and are you guys thinking about it?I have a lot of questions really but feel free to not answer all of them I just think these are issues that should be addressed. Can we expect it to be updated to a newer source engine the maps that people are building in source  hammer and porting to TF have graphical fidelity far beyond that of the current tf map list? Will the laundry list of problems with casual matchmaking every be actually fixed this is particularly important to me? Will the competitive matchmaking ever be taken seriously? Will VAC work again? Will pyro ever be fixed? What is the status of fixing arena it does not function in the game right now?I adore TF and will play it in one way or another long after its dead and gone but I cant help but feel like what first drew me to it has been lost since the matchmaking update. I cant adhoc join my friends in game or queue up with a group of more than  people. I cant join a game and pick the opposite team to pub against my friends or use any of my  dueling minigames and it takes longer to find a game and youre either kicked out of it when it ends or subjected to play on a completely different map with half the people.On the flip side competitive matchmaking is a joke with a questionable ranking system hackers everywhere maps and gamemodes not built for v and unbalanced weapons that are banned with good reason in the competitive scene.Like I said I love this game and I will still play it even if valve removes every map but hydro but its aging and it feels like more decisions lately have shown its age rather than modernize it if that makes sense.,The_Gaben,dck8sxw,2,t5_3ii9a

10376904,0,t3_5olhj4,First off thank you for bringing Steam to Linux with the SteamOS project. Its great to have so many games available on Linux now and thats mostly thanks to Valve pushing it forward in the last few years. However things seem to have been quiet on that front lately and some rumours say that layoffs have had a big impact on those projects.Are there any further plans for SteamOS at Valve is there still a team working on it at the moment?Does Valve do anything to encourage or assist developers in publishing their games on SteamOSLinux? I think Rocket League might be one example of thisWill SteamVR and HTC Vive support come to SteamOSLinux?Will Valve continue to release all of its own games on SteamOSLinux?,The_Gaben,dckaait,1,t5_3ii9a

10383130,0,t1_dck7wde,Its good to know the game is being acknowledged by the people at Valve. Im one of the people who bought the game back when it launched and followed its growth and changes. It always saddened me to see how despite immeasurable efforts by the competitive TF community to the point of paying the trips of entire teams from the US to Europe and things like that Valve seemed to always put TF second and only implement things surrounding the itemsequipment area. When the effort was done to implement competitive characteristics its golden age had passed.So its nice to know people still care abiut it .,The_Gaben,dckzpz8,1,t5_3ii9a
