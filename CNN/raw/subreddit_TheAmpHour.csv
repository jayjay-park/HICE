938170,0,t3_24t7hc,Never having seen a reference design for Qualcomm chipsets I have no idea about the implications of this. But I have seen countless reference designs used in consumer products before usually around a specialized IC. It seems like a lazy approach to design plop the reference design thats in the data sheet onto your board and poof you have a switching supply. I guess thats the result of the rush to get to market in the consumer goods world. You cant sit on your design and optimize when marketing is breathing down your neck. ,TheAmpHour,chaxbmi,1,t5_2uqxu

1606365,0,t3_2cp8vy,I am not sure I would call it a  success because I have since left the company and I dont believe they are profitable but we did successfully manufacture and ship our strange music controller called AlphaSphere The whole venture was mostly funded through grants and a little personal money and a  tiny bit of crowdfunding. We also had a free office space. We only took a bankloan at the end to produce the plastic tooling and do the final PCB production and assembly about  units.I was fresh out of Uni then and the whole process took about  years.,TheAmpHour,cjhneul,2,t5_2uqxu

10581525,0,t1_dd78smm,We wanted to make sure the device could be USB . powered.  The WiFi module takes around mA when active and our negative supply is a charge pump with a total of  mA.   When the OpenScope is working hard we draw about mA.This also allowed us to choose a much less expensive opamp for the power supply which helped us meet our  price tag goal.,TheAmpHour,dd7ei6o,3,t5_2uqxu
