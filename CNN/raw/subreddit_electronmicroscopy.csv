10401537,0,t3_59v4fc,gt Dear Muddled  gt I have an acquaintance who spends way too much time creating crafts for sale at a local arts fair and she is a black belt with the hotglue gun.  Ive seen her attach  baubles to a wreath in the time it takes me to drink a stein of dobblebock.  I would not recommend using this technique on your sample. I would also avoid any kind of coldmounting without some protection or at least watching an Ubertube video first.  Additionally old is a relative term that you shouldnt toss about lightly without several rounds of liquid bread blessed by St Francis of Paula.  Sometimes old is when ibuprofen becomes your favorite sleeping pill.  Maybe this technical person is mistaking the word sputter for spitting and is worried about vaporized saliva.  Speaking of which I could us a good Salvator about now.  What was the question again? Abbe,electronmicroscopy,dcn2xdk,1,t5_2rmvi
