My old laptop had a  mobility in it and it was a pain in the ass. Id never recommend any AMD products unfortunately. Their CPUs are bad Yes they are. and the video card drivers are insulting. I did get the  mobility to work more or less ok in linux though although I probably didnt get quite the same performance out of it it played games just fine for the most part. Im using nvidia on bumblebee right now bumblbee is a pain in the ass too but actually less than AMD if you ask me. To finally get to the point... what problems are you having with your AMD graphics?

It also has a few exercises at the end of every chapter so you can apply your newfound knowledge right away.This page has a nice cheat sheet of the most important commands.If you dont know exactly what a command does there is man for manual and then the command. eg. man aptget shows the manual for the program that you use to download other programs.Reminder if youre coming from Windows Linux is case sensitive.

1796726,0,t1_ck53ej1,Let me explain to you file fragmentation.Ever since DOS Microsoft has used a very very simple form of file allocation with no real code to make it efficient in any real manner. Say our drive looks like this This is  characters. Within them we store data. Lets do storage the NTFS way. Lets start by creating a file TestFileNow the first  characters are occupied. There is now a file at characters  to . Lets create another file. TestFileTESTAnd now we have another file at  to B. Lets edit the first file. TestFiTESTNow it is shorter by two characters now occupying  to . Now you wonder how defragmentation works? It condenses all data together again like so TestFiTESTNow the largest unused block is  chars and the TEST file has been moved from B to . But where do problems occur you ask? Lets continue with the fragmented example by adding yet another file. TestFiFITESTLEThis looks weird doesnt it? The file allocation of the third file is  AND CD. Why didnt it drop it in the large unused block at the end? Because Windows is shit at storage management. How would this be defragmented? Like so  TestFiFILETESTStupid isnt that? Well thats how Windows works. It sorts the files by whatever file comes first when read and moves all files further up without a second thought where a more sensible approach would be TEST before FILE but no Windows just has to be that guy. Well how would Linux handle this? Lets start anew with the first file TestFileEh thats odd. Middle of drive? That is because the hard drive heads neutral position is in the middle of the platter which is where that file would be when at the middle of the drive. This results in read speeds many many times faster than on Winodws. Now lets add the second file  TESTTestFileFirst unused block large enough to contain it without cutting it into pieces is used instead of cutting it up and THEN finding space for it. Lets shorten the first file as we did before. TESTTestFiAlright now we have two tiny one character unused blocks and one eight character block. Where do we put the third file? You guessed it TESTTestFiFILEFirst unused block large enough to hold the file. No cutting no bullshit no defragmentation requirement no shit read speeds because of cut files all over your computer. Also note that the zeroes following are very very useful for if we try to add to say the FILE file  TESTTestFiFILESNo cutting up. And on Windows? Lets add to the TEST file TestFiFITESTLEERThats two cut files and very confusing to read nevermind attempt file rescue from. File   file  B and EF file   and CD. This cutting also slows down reading the head having to move back and forth across the drive meaning more rumble action. Linux according to above example? Not so much. TESTTestFiFILESFile  B file   file  E.tldr Linux is king of efficnency.,linuxmasterrace,ck5mjee,2,t5_2ykcc

Theres less and less public transport every year while becoming about  more expensive every year. Police can barely keep security in the city center where the parliament embassys and major sightseeing locations are but everywhere else they closed pretty much every police department and police doesnt even investigate crimes unless it is sure that the criminal can be found. Berlin is also closing historical airports while failing at building a new one Youll likely heared that one before.... Nothing important here has money if things like bridges tunnels etc. well... you get the idea something public that is in everyones interest need renovations they will just be closed while the state spends millions for people whore here illegally long story short some northafrican people who came here god knows how occupied a school and threatened to jump from the roof if the state doesnt give them money a flat free public transport etc. and Berlin did this.In a city like this where also trams stink of dried poo seriously because they get cleaned veery rarely things like theyre using Windows XP doesnt surprise me and imo there are problems that must be adressed way more urgently than that.,linuxmasterrace,cpnx9kr,9,t5_2ykcc

3561198,0,t1_cpy2u0h,Id just like to interject for a moment. What youre referring to as Linux is in fact GNULinux or as Ive recently taken to calling it GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use.Linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added or GNULinux. All the socalled Linux distributions are really distributions of GNULinux,linuxmasterrace,cpy7ahd,5,t5_2ykcc

And it is the major mobile platform. Well I say just because something is awesome it doesnt help me get my work done. And I find it funny that mobile was supposed to be left out of the presentation but was used to counteract the desktop supremacy of software availability. You really want to use the whole Adobe Suite Microsoft Office and other powerful software for engineering biology and medicine audio and video production etc... on a tablet for more than  minutes? Really? Be honest with yourself even if these arent your personal needs. The paradigm of desktop computing shifted for teens who no longer have to be on a PC to do their snapchatting not for creative and productive folks who rely on desktop as production and highperformance rigs for which you do need optimised drivers. And believe it or not these are still the majority of people despite the mobile freakness these days. Im actually an Xubuntu user and recommend Linux to my friends who do most of their tasks on a browser anyway but this is a moot point. You need software you go Windows no matter how much it sucks in every other aspect. Deal with it. Damn if I could just run that one piece of software on Windows that is Linux only Said no one ever.

Malware targets Unix in general less because of a smaller home desktop share its hardly a thing that can target servers and business mainframes. As well as because of a smarter userbase.

Proprietary software like Windows especially if it has a monopoly which it does is harmful to everyone who uses a computer.  It leads to vendor lockin and hurts competition it gives corrupt governments a single target to coerce into betraying its customers and it encourages ignorance about the underlying capabilities of the software that people use every day.I dualboot Windows just like you I probably boot into Windows about twice a month and like you my only reason for doing so is because my friends who dont share my philosophy want to play a Windows exclusive game.

Be realistic. Id never go back to Windows but lets not all dance around in blissful ignorance thinking that Windows is a cesspool of blue screeens when its really not. This wallpaper looks like it was made by an edgy teenager and presumably one that doesnt have the best grasp of English either who wanted to lord it over his high school friends who run OS X or Windows and presumably couldnt possibly give less of a shit if they saw it. Also Go get a fucking linux makes you sound like the idiots who say Go get an Android or Go get a Droid. You do not get a Linux. You install Linux you obtain Linux you use Linux. Its like heshe extrapolated that people say get a Mac so therefore people must also say get a Linux. I love reading about all the crazy fun stuff that people do with Linux on this sub. The implied message in those posts is that you cant do this or that in other operating systems. Why be so directly abrasive about it? I dont think we need to stoop down to PCMR levels of peasant sniping and other immature crap. I feel ridiculous as a PC user every time I go into PCMR and up until recently Ive felt pretty comfortable here.

Its very much in a distros interests to keep malicious code out of their projects otherwise they may lose a significant portion of their community or customers to some other distro which does a better job of keeping the code secure.So I guess what Im getting at is Pick a distro that works for you. If you dont like corporate backed distros dont use them! If you prefer Ubuntu but someone calls you a noob fuck them use it!

4231768,0,t1_cs2l682,Probably it will be the same story as Unity. Being a Canonical inhouse project it wont be very well supported outside Ubuntu. Therefore Ubuntu will be regarded as an outsider Linux distribution for going their own way. But I think most people miss the bigger picture. Vendors like streamlined products. AMD NVIDIA Adobe Steam all the big names they dont want to commit resources to support the plethora of desktop environments or display servers or even packaging formats that exist in Linux. If Ubuntu provides the streamlined base distribution for which vendors can develop and provide technical support and on which they can make some profit obviously the entire Linux community can benefit from that not just Ubuntu users. Imagine that tomorrow Adobe launches CS for Ubuntu. Even if Adobes official support does not extend beyond Ubuntu the community can very well take advantage of their Ubuntu offering and bring it to other distros. And lets not forget that Ubuntu officially supports community derivatives that are not obligated to follow the main spin footsteps for example Kubuntu is expected to adopt Wayland instead of Mir. So yeah Canonical has their own way of doing things that sometimes is not compliant with upstream projects but even in that case all the work and effort that Canonical puts on their own Ubuntu reverts in some way or another to the overall Linux community starting by their own derivatives that are not under direct influence of corporate decisions.And that is why I love Ubuntu despite not being an Ubuntu user.,linuxmasterrace,cs2lv3t,2,t5_2ykcc

4426719,0,t1_csomkh4,Honestly Ive really wanted them to do this for a while.  If they were to put their OS engineering resources behind building NT compatibility layers on top of an MSbranded linux itd be really interesting to see what that would do to the PC.  It would be like when Apple bought NeXT to replace MacOS except on a much larger and more complicated and more exciting scale.  It would be a huge disaster due to  years of NT kludgery but it would be one that they would ultimately live through and they would end up more interesting on the other side.    I think Microsoft meant for everybody to believe that one of the biggest values of Windows is that gained from all of the nonOS software that runs on it but I think what is starting to happen with nonPC competition is that people are starting to see it from the perspective that the burden of Microsoft software is that it largely only runs on the OS Microsoft makes.    Far be it from me to tell Microsoft what to do I really wish they would focus on their nonOS software and I dont think it would hurt them in the end to do so.   ,linuxmasterrace,csoogoo,5,t5_2ykcc

4620887,0,t3_3ea2id,I suggest you go with NVidia if youll have a dedicated GPU at all  unless you want to use only open source drivers.I have a laptop with hybrid Intel  AMD GPU a Radeon HD M. This is the state of it right nowThe open source drivers are good and support PRIME. That is programs normally runs on the integrated Intel card unless I set DRIPRIME environment variable for them to run on the dedicated AMD GPU. So I can have all desktop programs run in the integrated card and just games on the AMD GPU and the fan actually spins down if the AMD GPU is not in use. But some games dont support the free drivers eg. Cities Skylines last time I tried and their performance arent that great  but most games are playable.Im now running the proprietary driver Catalyst . with PXP. I can switch between the Intel GPU and the AMD GPU but I need to restart X in order to switch Catalyst doesnt support PRIME. Catalyst has some bugs  for example League of Legends with PlayOnLinux didnt work before .. Also with it activated the system sometimes freeze for  or  seconds this happened right now.. Ive no idea whats the cause.Another problem is that Catalyst normally lags behind on Xorg support. . now supports Xorg . but when Xorg . is out it will take a while to update..Configuring my laptop had some challenges because the display output is actually controlled by the Intel card  if I disable it and try to use only the AMD card it doesnt work eg. I cant set nomodeset and use only Catalyst.For the record my laptop is a Dell Inspiron RA. But it was a gift I didnt actually choose it  I was burned before with an AMD GPU and wouldnt choose another one myself.Now the Nvidia proprietary driver also doesnt support PRIME.

Ive used a lot of distributions including Arch and Gentoo at different points in my life and I keep coming back to Debian.My suggestion is to start with something that sets the system up in some sane way use it for awhile until you learn why theyve made the choices they have then think about doing Arch once you understand why you might prefer a different configuration.,linuxmasterrace,cu38761,1,t5_2ykcc

Not everybody needs to be saved.Taking over a larger slice of the desktop is a war of attrition. Every year we gain a bit. Every year Microsoft shrinks a bit. I dont think we need  either. Id rather see a healthy mix where Windows Linux ChromeOS Mac OS X The BSDs and Haiku all have a good slice. That would strongly encourage interoperability and crossplatform development.Also there is no barrier to entry for Linux on the desktop. Anyone willing to use Linux and research on their own can do it. No permission needed.

5115186,0,t1_cv2jvik,gt Is the rollback functionality something that BTRFS has built in and pacupg makes use of during the upgrade process?Correct. BTRFS supports snapshots. A snapshot is an instant copy of a subvolume which is like the marriage of a partition and a folder. It takes up no extra space until data changes because until it changes its just the same data with two different locations pointing to it.So I snapshot the root subvolume. Then I update. Only files changed in the update take up extra space. If an update breaks something missioncritical that I dont have time to fix I just delete the updated root subvolume and restore the snapshotted one to its original name and set it as default. Now Im back to a state identical to before I upgraded.pacupg is just a wrapper for pacman upgrades. It takes a snapshot upgrades then takes another snapshot.Theres also snapper which is an OpenSUSE GUI tool for BTRFS snapshot management. BTRFS has really been coming into its own as the best Linux filesystem lately. OpenSUSE uses it by default. Its stable enough for everyday use on any distro with a semirecent kernel.Though bcachefs looks like it might be giving BTRFS a run for its money in the next couple of years. It aims to support all the features of BTRFS with better performance and native cache device support. Im running bcache in front of my main BTRFS Arch drive and it works wonderfully.,linuxmasterrace,cv2kkpg,5,t5_2ykcc

This is nice but also somewhat annoying when youd want to edit files the oldfashioned way as these changes get overwritten on reboot. Getting this ascii welcome was a pain in the ass mostly because of that.So first impressions are mixed but at least its not cancer like the other networking class I have this semester OMNeT can go suck a dick or a few seriouslygt  Im kinda surprised theyre teaching VyOS at your school over the standard Cisco networking track.The assistant at the subject also has an Openstack class ez  credits as hes apparently a minor contributor there.

You could do grep current CPU instead of the grep and specific line in sed you can also use awk to print a specific row seperated by the default IFS awk  print   in this case would work in place of the cut The same thing applies to the sensors stuff using character ranges is going to be rather error prone nvidiasettings is SLOW so cache the results of that if you can too.

But apparently some parts of RemixOSs EULA is a must for every Chinabased company hence it seems to be copypasted. For example look at Xiaomis User Agreement. If you look closely they also have the exact same sentence in Remixs You agree that you irrevocably waive any and all ownership legal and moral rights to your user contentEDIT Keep in mind that XiaomiJIDE clearly specified User Contents asgtUser Content refers to all the content your information picture music or others resulting from downloads releases or other activities through the Site and XiaomiJIDE Service. You are solely responsible for such content and bear all risks that result from your disclosure of such User Content. AFAIU Legally this means that if you use any service they provide you agreed that should you ever download or upload anything into XiaomiJIDEs siteservices it would fall under User Contents as described in XiaomiJIDEs EULA and resulting in loss of ownership of your data inside their servers. However if you dont uploaddownload anything to Xiaomis server it wont affect you.Keep in mind that I dont know whether XiaomiJIDEs hardware and Android MIUIRemixOS falls under XiaomiJIDEs service. If the latter falls into XiaomiJIDEs Services use CyanogenMod. If the former falls switch your device.I cant say the same with JIDERemix since I never saw their full EULA but if its somewhat same as Xiaomis my point is applicable.EDIT  So it is copied from Xiaomis EULA page after all.Theyll either need to make a new EULA for people outside China or limit themselves to Chinese markets only.Well Im glad I tested Remix without putting any personal data but now Im wiping the partition.,linuxmasterrace,cywh6km,12,t5_2ykcc

LibreOffice is now beating download records proving how essential it is for most peoples day to day needs but for ages the Linux community considered that a conjugated effort to develop a FLOSS office suite one of if not the most used piece of software on the planet to be unnecessary.

It is extremely important to support the cause of free software it appears that GNU  Linux is experiencing a eternal September period and it is important for new users to realize that the entire purpose of this operating system is to ensure the freedom of its users. If the ideals of GNU  Linux are lost proprietary software will begin to sneak in as it has recently done. Furthermore referring to the operating system as GNU  Linux is an important part of this first referring to the system as Linux is a technical misnomer as Linux is simply the kernel of the operating system a small piece of the entire system second by using the term GNU  Linux we help to ensure that users understand that the primary purpose of this operating system is freedom. You are right  switching to the GNU  Linux system is a great step in the right direction. But users cannot forget or ignore the reason this operating system exists to begin with freedom. By ensuring that users understand the principles of freedom that go into this operating system and by working to ensure that it is not corrupted by proprietary software we are ensuring that we have this excellent free operating system for years to come.Im very glad that we have been able to establish this excellent dialog about free software.

Youve said the truth my friend.Personally I cant argue about Skype because I really dont like it and I dont use it anymore because Microsoft actually dropped support on the Linux client so I dont want to use something that is practically abandoned it feels awful. But I have to agree with you especially on the whole openclosed source thing and more especially on video drivers. Cmon proprietary NVIDIA video drivers for example I dont use AMD but it should apply as well are always better than opensource ones because they made the fucking GPU in the first place for fucks sake. How the fuck can someone from outside know more than themselves? Makes no fucking sense.gt A lot of people have software that they need access to daily that there is no linux version forAlso agree but knowledge can counter this sometimes e.g. I am only blocked by Fruity Loops and Sony Vegas since they dont have a Linux port if we dont count ish games I have that are Windowsonly but with WINE I actually managed to run FL flawlessly. Vegas on the other hand didnt had that luck but I temporarily countered that by running it on a Windows inside a virtual machine and that cuts it for now. There are people who manage this like me and there are people who as you said earlier just dont want to get geeky and just want their OS to work its all a matter of perspective. Some may find their migration to Linux way easier than they thought I dont use Photoshop for example so GIMP is alright for me and Im also looking at Vegas alternatives like Kdenlive yet Im still heavily bonded to Vegas and some may just not be able to come to Linux at all its just a matter of perspective.BUT we seriously need developers to make native ports because WINE isnt going to hold our hands forever.Also fuck FOSS.

Youll probably be scared off Linux even before you begin.Just know that Linux looks are not defined by the distribution you choose but by the DE desktop environment or WM window manager. You can make any distro look like any other with a bit of configuration.I would recommend Ubuntu or one of its deritarives to start with as its easy to use and widely supported. Ubuntu comes with the DE Unity but you can also get Kubuntu KDE Xubuntu XFCE Lubuntu LXDE Ubuntu Mate Mate or Ubuntu Gnome Gnome.Fedora should be fine as well comes with Gnome by default but its a bit more of a hassle to get proprietary software on running.,linuxmasterrace,d1j22fc,12,t5_2ykcc

8993556,0,t3_53g2l1,No Richard its Linux not GNULinux. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you RMS and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.Following are some reasons for you to mull over including some already answered in your FAQ.One guy Linus Torvalds used GCC to make his operating system yes Linux is an OS  more on this later. He named it Linux with a little help from his friends. Why doesnt he call it GNULinux? Because he wrote it with more help from his friends not you. You named your stuff I named my stuff  including the software I wrote using GCC  and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You dont want to be known as a nag do you?An operating system ! a distribution. Linux is an operating system. By my definition an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Linux in use. However Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system a server a development box or a graphics workstation or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration we have a Linux based distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title GNULinux when said bundled software is largely from the FSF. Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat Mandrake and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.Next even if we limit the GNULinux title to the GNUbased Linux distributions we run into another obvious problem. XFree may well be more important to a particular Linux installation than the sum of all the GNU contributions. More properly shouldnt the distribution be called XFreeLinux? Or at a minimum XFreeGNULinux? Of course it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted. Yes I know youve heard this one before. Get used to it. Youll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it.You seem to like the linesofcode metric. There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Linux distribution. You seem to suggest that more LOC  more important. However I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance. I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric. For example if my system spends  of its time executing XFree code XFree is probably the single most important collection of code on my system. Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware it certainly isnt more important code than XFree. Obviously this metric isnt perfect either but LOC really really sucks. Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument.Last Id like to point out that we Linux and GNU users shouldnt be fighting among ourselves over naming other peoples software. But what the heck Im in a bad mood now. I think Im feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and yes so very useful only because Linux was developed. In a show of proper respect and gratitude shouldnt you and everyone refer to GCC as the Linux compiler? Or at least Linux GCC? Seriously where would your masterpiece be without Linux? Languishing with the HURD?If there is a moral buried in this rant maybe it is thisBe grateful for your abilities and your incredible success and your considerable fame. Continue to use that success and fame for good not evil. Also be especially grateful for Linux huge contribution to that success. You RMS the Free Software Foundation and GNU software have reached their current high profiles largely on the back of Linux. You have changed the world. Now go forth and dont be a nag.Thanks for listening.,linuxmasterrace,d7svwrk,25,t5_2ykcc

Boot Live CD.. Connect to the internet.. Make partitions  filesystems and mount them. Download stage extract it with tar xjpf  and do some basic configuring mount pseudo filesystems configure make.conf  before chrooting in.. Chroot and do basic setup like set profile default USE flags. Install and compile kernel. Install a dhcpcronlocate implementations.. Install and configure a bootloader. reboot ampamp prayThe stage part is the most important one without it you dont have Gentoo.Do you want open source drivers?

10319463,0,t3_5nqu6o,I dont see any reason to permanently hang on one choice and obsessively ignoring every other option there is.Linux is very ugly in many aspects but I personally find the Windows experience to be much less pleasant in general and I find Linux fitting me better. I still rarely boot to Windows only for playing specific games. Theres no reason to be blamed or feel guilty for using Windows even with specific CAD software as the only reason behind it. Being versatile is much more beneficial than trying too much to fit one set of ideas.Youve got a few good points against the views of the FLOSS community. Its blatantly unfair to blame people for not willing to work without pay. I somewhat disagree on seeing the undocumented Windows registry as a practical way of configuring things. Linux configuration files document themselves with loads of inline comments.A couple of years back I acted like a total linuxpreaching jerk thinking that other people would actually want to give a shit about what their PCs run. Now Im starting to get pissed off about seeing toxic overelitist behavior in any community that circles around some choice perceived as superior over others. The inherent purpose of the human brain is to filter immense amounts of information into complex feedback loops. Take PCMR FLOSS community or any religion as examples. People keep patting each other in the back for unanimous opinions and repeated observations while being discomforted by anything that signals disagreement. Most of the time theres no truth to be discovered or a single correct way of doing things.,linuxmasterrace,dcdrnb3,9,t5_2ykcc

10689367,0,t3_5sx7fr, Fedora updates packages quite regularly. I am not sure what exactly constitutes a rolling distro I think it has to do with versioning or major releases. Fedora does have major releases. For example Wayland by default on GNOME was only implemented in F it was available as an option in F.  Ive done a direct upgrade from F to F and a direct upgrade from F to F separate images so not an unbroken line from F to F as it were. I found it pretty painless I ran the commands it downloaded the packages installed them nothing broke.  No experience with this There are the COPR repos which are sort of like the AUR I think most of these are singleuse though for specific programs. I would think that Ubuntu LTS is inherently more stable because it doesnt introduce new features on a regular basis. That being said Ive had very few issues running Fedora. Ive been a convert for about . years and I love it. It worked well on my previous Samsung laptop though the Samsung kernel module seemed to not like UEFI mode meaning my keyboard backlight didnt work and it works very well on my ThinkPad T.Im not a particularly hardcore user mind you.

What youre refering to as Linux is in fact GNULinux or as Ive recently taken to calling it GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added or GNULinux. All the socalled Linux distributions are really distributions of GNULinux!,linuxmasterrace,dec4bs5,6,t5_2ykcc

10980949,0,t1_decgk13,Oh for sure. Arch makes it easy to keep the system up to date with the latest and greatest of everything.The question is once you have your machine set up perfectly.. will the latest and greatest improvements actually add anything or is it more likely that theyll upset the balance of your personal configuration?This gets particularly interesting when you run locally built packages from the AUR that dont always get updated in lockstep with the core binary packages which has lead to the occasional weird bug for me.As far as I know there isnt a way to apply security only updates to packages in Arch updating the system is sort of an allornothing proposition. Depending on what sorts of things youre doing with your OS this might be a good thing or a bad thing. But you have to ask yourself is a continual stream of tiny incremental feature improvements more valuable than long term consistency?I run Arch on all my computers. Its totally manageable but comes with a degree of effort and risk that I think doesnt best fit a majority of use cases.Im definitely overstating the risk but imagine youre up bright and early before some important event where you need your computer running just like it was yesterday. You check Reddit and a big scary day has been announced. On Arch youre probably going to have to update your whole computer including trivial updates to minor things or risk not patching until later. I guess you just hope that the software youre going to rely on later is still running stably and that all the devs of all the libs your software uses havent done anything weird recently..Anyway Im just saying its a different philosophy. A bit more reckless a bit more interesting and time consuming.,linuxmasterrace,decnmk2,3,t5_2ykcc

For that the LGPL is excellent. The I use a GPL library in my program therefore my program must also be released under the GPL thing is a sound idea in theory but horribly written in the licence text of the GPL. It mentions static and dynamic linking in a Clike way. None of that stuff makes any sense for say a Python program but Python programmers sort of just respect the licence terms all the same.Not that any of it matters.

11749922,0,t1_dgrk7nc,gtHowever GIMP is more powerful than PTS.  Ya know if GIMP was more powerful than Photoshop I could forgive the terrible interface. But its not.
