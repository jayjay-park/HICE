8970970,0,t1_d7q243a,Im not saying its the main factor what I mean is fame for changing and improving the field they sit in which Atkinson has done. The most famous when looking at history arent always the best indicators of locating achievement and its even worse an indicator when it comes to whoever is famous during a specific time period. But often those that are remembered are remembered for legitimate achievement. Norm hasnt been as famous but his genius and uniqueness is as great as any output is decent but hasnt had the resources or space in his career to allow his talent to be fully recognized and therefore potential for output has not reached where it could  which I think is right up the with the all time GOATS. Hopefully hes recognised and one of the greatest for whatever reason when alls said and done.

I saw tickets for this listed months ago.. ive seen most of my favorite comedians before and norm is maybe my all time favorite up there with bill burr...but ive never had the chance to see him yet. hopefully he comes back to boston again soon when i can make it.But anyway.. USUALLY the performer will hang out in the hall way near the exit doors and will take a photo or sign something and say hello for anyone willing to wait a few minutes. Dont expect to hang out with him or anything though lol.. but most performers are very appreciative to say hi to fans thank you for coming shake hands take a photo with you sign something etc.  just be courteous and dont take up too much of their time remember other people are waiting too the performers are also usually selling DVDs or something at the same time which is kinda the reason they hang around for a bit i think most of the time...i dont think norm has anything to sell at the moment? but i think its kind of traditionassumed they do the meetgreet thing as people are leaving regardless i wouldnt hold it against him if he doesnt though it might be disappointing but he might have a million reasons why he doesnt have time or something.The wilbur is great for seeing standup. only downside is that im tall and the seats are small for someone tall like me. Id say you have a very good chance of getting your stuff signed and it shouldnt be more than a  minute wait at most the majority of the people just walk straight out of the theater so its not a huge crowd of people waiting for photosautographs,NormMacdonald,dcmiduz,3,t5_2um0a

11674801,0,t1_dgiw7sp,I seriously disagree that a word can be hack. Usually a TOPIC is described as hack and even that is wrongthere are many exceptions to the rule but a WORD.. no. Norm doesnt do old tired jokes that feel lazy. He just does him.I was down on him for a bit with his twitter stuff too but Ive sort of come back from that. Hes a weird guy an eccentric guy fucked in the goddamn head  whatever you want to call it  but thats just the price of genius or whatever. The cost of funny. I still think that meeting him in person hed be the nicest guy and someone I could largely get along with. My friends and I can be pretentious fuckwads too. Im just kidding I dont have any friends. But basically he seems like a reasonable person. If jesus himself walked on earth I think hed sound fucking pretentious too. I prolly wouldnt like that guy anywhere as near as much as Norm. I think you just gotta look at it from a different place.Obviously the podcast delay is annoying to us  his existing loyal fans. But it seems like he wants to reach a larger audience with the remaining episodes and not waste them on us. Maybe thats a good business decision. Well probably remain his loyal fans despite the delay and hell prolly get more fans if he releases the podcast on a larger platform.. so... sounds like good business to me.I think some or Norms humour comes from the tension created by his seeming incompetencestupidityetc. Even as a fan Im constantly like what is this what are you doing what is this joke Norm oh boy youre fucking it up and he always nails it. I dunno how on purpose it is but thats what he does.,NormMacdonald,dgjcse2,2,t5_2um0a
