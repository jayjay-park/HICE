6499341,0,t1_czrcvra,gt At what point did you figure out Magnifito was the Mule?i suspected the moment we met him. ESPECIALLY with the whole he doesnt let anyone see him. it just seemed too convenient that those two got picked out of the crowd and allowed to escape. at the very least he was Mules agent but i pretty much knew it was him even if i didnt know what he was doing and why he was doing what he was doing. but i did not think Toran was being controlled. i thought it was just a spark of bravery in front of his new wife. gtBut take that logic to the extreme and Hitlar or rapists or bankers arent really evil either.which is why i like to look at the results of actions. so actions themselves cannot be evil to an extent only the intention and the result can paint them as such. gtSpeaking of Mis do you find the characters a bit onedimentional?yes! i see them as primary colors Asimov is using to paint a picture not risking making a blend only to have a poop color be the result that messes up the whole painting. besides i think the books intention is not to give us either interesting characters or enticing plot or beautiful prose for that matter i think the intention is to show us a situation and let us decide the good the bad and the ugly. ,readalong,czrkx46,1,t5_2w204

9054007,0,t1_d7ztr8e,I definitely agree with your take on the conflict. I initially assumed the book would more be man vs. nature given the mission to colonize Mars. I imagined it would be how the team worked together to survive  essentially what was in Nadias POV but for the whole book. I was pretty surprised and disappointed like you were too that the book instead focused on more petty drama...given that all the characters are supposedly in their s and s youd think there should be any more high school love triangles and grudges. I saw this as KSRs attempt to show that human nature regardless of where people are is constant. The need to form relationships the struggle for power the frustration. I wonder if a structure or some sort of law will just develop organically if one character will just take charge. My favourite character so far is either Nadia or Arkady. Nadia is the most practical and humble  its interesting how all the colonists were chosen for their technical abilities yet of all the characters introduced so far Nadia is the only one who rejects all politics and does not try to push any kind of ideology. Arkady I kind of see as the opposite  he wants radical change. Like Nadia I feel he is one of the most honest characters. He is rather transparent about his goals. That is a rare trait and I hope we get a chapter on him later on.I find Im not a big fan of the imagerytechnical descriptions. Im pretty impressed with the research KSR put into the book  the mission how Mars looks like how the colony is built it is all very realistic. However I find myself skimming the paragraphs upon paragraphs of description about the landscape. Thank goodness Im reading it on a Kindle since I keep having to search up definitions. I realize my vocabulary is pretty limited haha. The most interesting idea raised is terraforming. The colony needs to have a united stance on what they want to do exactly on Mars. I really really hope it does not turn into a second Earth. But based on the politics and drama that seem to be a reoccuring theme throughout the book I wouldnt be surprised if people started mining or trying to govern Mars. Im mostly curious about the different perspectives of the colonists and hope the next POV might be from Hiroko or somebody more involved with the biology and sustainability aspect of the colony. ,readalong,d805b2e,2,t5_2w204
