3151276,0,t3_2w7d4m, I dont think my big boy Ollie is to full standards but he was a pull from a puppy mill when he was  months old and I rescued him.  So to to be honest I dont give a crap that he may not meet standards.  I care that hes in a loving home and healthy and happy.  My Bella is also a rescue was found dumped but Im pretty sure shes got most standardsme with Bella    Ollie  ,stbernards,cooml39,2,t5_2st28
