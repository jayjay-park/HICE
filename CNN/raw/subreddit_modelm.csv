9717437,0,t3_5e8j7b,I would rather do the bolt mod myself.  Ive seen some fairly terrible mods out there.  Maybe I got lucky but I own two both  and they havent needed one.  The box is nice but nothing here justifies the high cost.  I would save your money and let this one go.  Youll thank yourself in six months time when the right one comes along.,modelm,daavvas,2,t5_2rspz
