10545209,0,t1_dd2x06f,Hello Sorry to hear about your Dad thats pretty rough. I am pretty amazed at how prevalent this appears to be within your family. First of all the complications are minimal. Admittedly there is a risk or infection and bleeding from the site however this is unlikely and dependent on the care you receive whilst in hospital. When I had my biopsy I had a small plaster placed over the site  I hope this indicates the size of the puncture they made to biopsy. To be honest I had a different shall we say journey I was referred on an emergency basis so I had little time to contemplate the biopsy. So unlike some other individuals I did not have months to ponder shall Ishant I. In my opinion this was a good thing. Had things happened different I still would of had the biopsy. Knowing for sure has allowed the people treating me to tailor the best possible medication plan. I had nephrotic range proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. The biopsy results also revealed inflammation and crescents. Had they not know this I doubt they would have been able to treat me as well as they have. I think if you have a moderatesevere form you need to know for clinical reasons. Whereas in milder forms you can kind of get the control back and deal with it. But that is just my personal opinion. ,IgANephropathy,dd3f0zb,2,t5_2wqpq
