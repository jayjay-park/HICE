Its not that they arent capable its just that its very rare.Creating a female only league is a cheap and possibly sexist way to draw in more views for your event.  Its a lame tactic but its been used off and on for years now.Chess junior leagues exist even though there is no difference in the ability to play between a kid and adult.  But the chances that an adult is better practiced and prepared than the child is going to be very high.  So they separate the two so that the lesser players kids can play amongst themselves and still enjoy themselves and have competitive games.

We have to deal with the money system strategies based on smokes flashbangs etc. bigger roundtime bigger maps.

1511180,0,t1_cj5mbq6,I just wanted to highlight a problem Ive been having for years. People complain about the inaccuracies of the site yet they dont bother to do anything to help. Im not talking about people who want to help but cant because of websites going down and information being lost Im talking about people who basically say they cant be bothered to help.Less than a year ago people in the CounterStrike community were singing the same tune. I only had around  CS . tournaments and m in prize money on record. frest had somewhere around k or some other ridiculously low number. CSSource barely had anything. I only added what I could find. And of course people complained about the site missing a lot of tournaments but the important thing to note is that they never complained about this to me the person who added these tournaments to the site. I only found new information by looking for people complaining about the site who mention specific tournaments. I had my contact info on every page on the site but they never told me anything directly. After a few months of this a few CS fans started sending me info. Now theres m in prize money and  tournaments and its all because CS fans sent me links to news articles on HLTV SKGaming Fragbite and a bunch of nonEnglish websites that covered these tournaments. I never would have found any of this information if it wasnt for them and I dont hear any complaints from the CS community anymore.Now I have a Tip System where anyone can anonymously send in a tip to let me know of any missing information or corrections that need to be made no registration required. I also made a sandbox editor to allow other people to join and help addedit the data on the site. Its really been instrumental in getting these missing tournaments on the site but every now and then Ill find people like the one I posted who rants about the inaccuracy of my site yet does nothing to contribute. The info I have for SC Dota  LoL and CS are there because people contribute. Im getting sick and tired of people bitching and having me go on wild goose chases for information that may not even exist. I just feel like I have to get this off my chest.

1560034,1,t1_cjbrp29,Its a good thing for the company as they rake in more  and if you happen to be within that crowd of players. Else it makes little difference for the vast majority of gamers who do not play LoL.LoL was most definitely not designed around being a competitive title if it were you wouldnt have gimmicks like Runes amp Masteries the locking of champions and runes vital gameplay content or a lack of replays spectating and proleague system at the beginning.Dota  is a niche competitive title because it was designed with eSports in mind. It had spectating and replays from the getgo and the very unveiling of it was in the form of a . million tournament between the top  DotA teams in the world.The amount of players a game has has no correlation to the  of dedicated players it possesses. I never said that Dota  was necessarily a better eSport  only that its one that lives and breathes fine due to the high amount of interest for the scene.Yes . million people play Dota  but its not like people whove never played Dota  before dont tune in. Its not like people who dont normally play or watch footballsoccer dont tune into the World Cup. There are  billion people on Earth. Remember that.Yes TI had  million views across the main event while S finals had supposedly  million but as Ive mentioned already you wanna play with numbers?? LoL had over  million players at the time while Dota  only had . million. All that shows is how much more impressive the viewership numbers were for TI. Yes but guess what? We dont care about LoL. Have you ever seen Valve write an article featuring LoL or Riot? On the contrary how many times has Riot or an employee mentioned DotA in their attempts to justify their game design?

It can play games fine sure but not to some of the standards that gaming and esports enthusiasts would like to see. Apple had their chance with gaming back in  with Bungie and Halo.

2605885,0,t1_cmynxou,I think thats a very good point. I think that is probably another good reason for cross pollination actually. If some of these personalities that jump ships were more spread between a number of scene they wouldnt feel forced to be changing shirts all the time. Instead of having to worry about putting their eggs all in one basket each time they could try focusing on producing limited quality content for each sphere allowing for things they are interested in without having to jump ship.In the end I would want the personality focusing on the game they do love best. I do think sometimes people are personalities because they do love being a semicelebrity only for celebrities sake but I also think many of them do what they do because they love the games. I also think its possible for them to become a personality in one until they find a game they might like even more. That happens with all the rest of us joes why is it so hard to figure that they are people to who have changing and developing whims? If a game has problems and a community suffers because of it I see no reason why some content producers would move to somewhere less volatile or hostile. Im not saying its a wise decision and Im definitely not going to say anything about true fanaticism but if I enjoyed making content and I didnt see an improving environment I would probably have to jump ship too.But in the end Im hoping that if a content producer or personality is able to broaden their interests and focuses diversify assets as one might say they could not only help the problem communities that they still love while still profiting from growing communities.

CoD doesnt have a lot of the challenges of other fps games that give players the opportunity to express themselves. The movement is incredibly simple compared to arena fps games like Quake UT or Tribes. The recoil controll is quite a bit simpler than in any CS iteration. Afaik and correct me if Im wrong you obviously know CoD better than I do there are only hitscan weapons apart from grenades thats not a lot of variation in terms of weapon types. And unless my CoD and CoD Promod experience does not apply at all to the more modern CoD games the handling for these weapons is all very similar. Again were not talking black and white here there are obviously differences but I doubt its as clear cut as CS for example.I actually do know a bit about the CoD PC competitive scene in EU because Im friends with two guys who played it at a very high level.

4785438,0,t3_3g9bqy,The person who wrote this is incredibly biased and probably plays DotA . The scene technically is a lot more competitive than DotA and CSGO thats why pros give up practically their life for it. Im saying the writer is a DotA player because the game doesnt really have a shallow learning curve and the term noob friendly is quite degradatory. Its the most popular eSport not because its extremely complicated its popular because its fun and easy to watch spectator sport. The LAN environment is neccesary. I dont remember the link but the amateur scene is played online. One of the recent online games very important was DDOSd. This led to them having to reset the game. LAN is important so Riot the company have full control of the matches being played. Im not sure where you got your info from but IEM by ESL is a nonRiot affiliated event yet many LCS teams played there. The fact is not many tournaments are held its sad but true. IEM is the only nonRiot affiliated one. League structure is very different from other eSports. It follows a more traditional sport structure rather than tournament realm.  games a week is like what you would see in sports like Football or Soccer. And then after their regional leagues finish they have their world championships. Its nothing like any other eSport because simply theyre the innovators. They reach for a larger crowd in a more traditional manner. With other eSports they have dozens of tournaments with League since theres only  or  proffesionals leagues per region and these last year long it reaches a very large crowd. Albeit this is not ideal for eSport enthusiasts since they want more games many nondie hard fans prefer this.  LCS games every weekend for NA and EU. Since League has more teams than other eSports  games is really the limit for a weekend and then they practice during the week. Last year Riot used to have this thing called Super Week where teams would play multiple games every day. They voted it out simply because it was overly stressful and tiring. League is not a traditional eSport and this writer seems to have a massive agenda against Riot. This quote near the end of the articles proves it RIOT are terrible and everything they do is terrible. Soooo many people in the community would disagree. Riot has their fair share of shit decisions after all theyre a  year old company but theyve always put the community first. They LISTEN to the community which is something Valve doesnt do as often. I bet after all the feedback from the community Riots approach to sandbox mode has changed. The game isnt magically the best eSport because Riot have somehow made an addicting game. Its the best eSport because rioters and the community have brought it this far because people actually love this game and wanted it to grow. ,esports,ctxqssd,-1,t5_2r08k

Ive been told this by people more knowledgeable than myself and by players who have moved from another state to my state.  If you have more than one weekly  which Ive been told is not uncommon due to a decent amount of players not being able to go to the other weekly due to schedule or travel issues and you could easily double that number.

5120181,0,t3_3l2di4,I really dont understand why you need money to start. Yeah he talked about the slush fund for a variety of different things that would be nice but thats so ridiculously far down the line that I dont even think its worth spending time discussing right now.Something he completely didnt touch on is blacklisting of organizations tournament organizers and teams who are acting unethically or treating players poorly. Specifically enumerated concerns backed by a majority of the players can alleviate this problem significantly. To me that is the NUMBER ONE goal of a union and something that could have been solved  years ago.I also dont like how he talks about exclusivity. Yes restricting membership to players from the top  teams in each esport or something would be silly but those are the players that will make or break the union because theyre the ones who are taking the most significant risks and who provide the star power for the union to matter. After theres  CSGO players in the union you can talk about opening membership to CEVOM teams or whatever for concerns that completely pale in comparison to professional issues in the scene.

5295132,0,t3_3nixs6,In my opinion this is good news bad news and dangerous news. I agree with Bryce on the fact that this hopefully will raise the bar for tournaments throughout. Over saturation is a terrible problem and was causing the overall standard of the ecosystem to go down. From the advertiserssponsorside where I have my experiences event oversaturation and the lowering of the bar was making some potential new sponsors hesitant to enter the market and already established ones get lower results with more dilution. Hopefully this teamup can force tournament hosts to raise their bars and filter out hosts that cant quite meet the standard yet. This is bad news for the sort of grassroots organic growth that has built up eSports so far. eSports has been very top heavy and this just adds weight up there. This is making a line so deep that its going to be hard for new organizations and tournaments to popup. Only a few already established tournaments besides publisher ones like ESL Dreamhost EVO etc can still invite these teams who draw fans and the door to create your own tournament is now all but closed. which is a very big anticompetitiveness problem.  This could be the step that eSports takes from fandom to corporation. This teamup is also very dangerous in the fact that its few toplevel organizations trying to create the rules for eSports. They arent asking tournaments to fullfill their wishes they are demanding. Taking away power from the players tournaments and other entities these organizations are pulling it onto themselves. If its obliged easily it could create room for them to demand more in the future. However take my post with a pinch of salt as it is all just an opinion. ,esports,cvoij3l,3,t5_2r08k

5418371,0,t1_cw44xz6,Hi Callum glad you found your way here! It is for sure organisations flexing their muscles and I think it is the right time to do so regarding the wild developments in the CSGO tournament landscape. It will help if they can manage to provide a professional structure and equal treatment for every team that wants to be part of it. The legitimacy of a group often shows by how many want to be subjected to its logic and lobby work. You will see that not all orgs want to be part of that one lobby group. Union is a powerful but misleading label here as Bryce already explained in his article about that movement.I think players need to have their own lobby group and from what I hear they are working on it. Lobby work from orgs will benefit them when interests overlap but a lobby group for orgs will probably go for more money into the org pockets not the player pockets for example ,esports,cw496nh,3,t5_2r08k

5788049,0,t3_3u2u0t,I think the main problem you will see with traditional sport coaches coming to esports is simply that the players have no little experience being coached.In traditional sports coaches serve a purpose for years. The players learn from their coach and get used to being coached by someone else at a young age over a period of years. Players also have training practice health and fitness aspects that they will learn from a coach.Esports is focused on learning by yourself. Most players did nothing but solo Q before being put on a team for tryouts. They are not used to being coached by someone else and this will be a whole new world for traditional sports coaches.I have consulted with a professional UFC coach in regards to training and sport psychology stuff. The truth is the way he handles people is  opposite of what would be happening in esports now. If an athlete cant perform he just nixes them. If they have an ego gone. Meanwhile a lot of these athletes are coming from a background where they are conditioned to be coached efficiently over years.Players in esports dont have this experience and to be honest most wont care about miscellaneous things. So they are going to want the cookie cutter point a to point b in as few steps as little effort as possible.I think its more of a PR move than a useful move. While the coach role is limited as long as coaches can not make calls be in voice comms during the game anyway all you can do is kind of mentally prepare them and give a pep talk and hope for the best.I see a lot of problems for those coaches when they realize their go to training strategies see very little outcome from young players who are not preconditioned from years of coaching seeking advice ala traditional sports.,esports,cxek8lp,1,t5_2r08k

6017818,1,t3_3xw4u6,This lady has not done her sociology or gender studies homework very well The overall article tone makes me feel like Im reading a diatribe of why women shouldnt unionize or continue to grow their own unique gamer demographic and teams. Especially the reactive title. Despite that the last two paragraphs did steer the discussion in the right direction.gt Absolutely not. Despite large strides of progress there still remains a large gap in the ratio of professional women to men both in skill and numbers. Whats causing this and how can womens events morph to aid the disparity? I dont know the answers myself but I assure you that these questions are far more worth investigating than Should all womens tournaments take place?And then the followup questions she asks are important for the most part.But Id have rather read an article on her answering those questions herself and proposing innovative solutions not just posing them with a cynical and doubtful title and article tone. It doesnt read very feminist or proactive at all it bugs me out. No thanks. Also with so much money at play in the woman competitive gamer demographic its only going to blow up at a geometric rate the more ESports in general become mainstream. I too would like to see more people answer her questions at the end but ESports is still an emerging market so I dont feel there is a just war to be fought with inclusivity over exclusivity as much as other more radicalized feminists may. Im an intersectional feminist that specializes in psychosocial dynamics and the sociology of gender inequality at the Ph.D. level myself so it just doesnt compute. I believe this type of outlook will be academically mass accepted as fourthwave feminism quite soon.

6501767,0,t3_44k15c,I think esports in Australia is sort of where it was in the US  years ago. we are growing but will likely not become a large powerhouse or put a dent in international competition Renegades are the exception at the moment.Another reason is the travel. Chiefs recently played at IEM taipei and stated they were glad the travel was only  hours. to most teams this is one of the larger distances they have to travel.Regarding OPs question there are plenty of events going on. Cybergamer has been running tournaments for years and ASL just partnered with ESL increasing their investment here. of course you have OPL in LoL as well as the OCS. We also recently had Avant Garde compete in the SWC and will soon see immunity and Exile compete at the halo WC.Shameless PlugI actually record a podcast where we go through international esports news but cover as much of the oceanic scene as we can. we try to get interviews with players managers and even whole teams on a regular basis talking about what it is like to be a pro player in Australia. Feel free to take a listen and leave us any feedback. we are improving weekly and feedback would allow us to continue to improve and provide what listeners want.In conclusion Yes Oceanic esports is there and yes it is growing.

I said  rounds depending on the amount of teams Id just go for  teams tbh. Yes it is a large number of games... As it should be. Players should be able to take it I mean Majors are once every  or more months...  Viewers need not worry  again all of it would be done without live audiences.  Those that REALLY want to watch all of these games could via multiple streams. Otherwise they can ignore it and watch the Main Event.Honestly the issue is the large amount of teams  is too much.If you want to have  teams and dont want it to last too long then you have shitty formats like we have at IEMs and Majors Oh wow a team lost two Bos... Better send them packing!I say bring  teams.Further  and that was my initial point  screw trying to seed the teams based on past results... It will never work.That is the whole point of the Swiss System Seeding Stage  all teams are on equal footing Have them play out the Swiss System Seeding Stage and by the time it is done youll know the actual current power rankings...Then just assign them seeds from  through  and place them in the bracket and that is it.,esports,d13yryk,1,t5_2r08k

7405677,0,t1_d2jyl3o,Here is an exert from the wiki on Franchises and comparisons between how franchises are run with contrast between NA and EU. As you can see relegation model not incorporated in NA model and is deliberately being addressed by team owners in League that they do not want relegation for franchise teams.  Put key information in bold.  gt Professional sports leagues in North America comprise a stipulated number of clubs known as franchises which field one team each. The franchises have territorial rights usually exclusive territories large enough to cover major metropolitan areas so that they have no local rivals. New teams may enter the competition only by a vote of current members typically a new place is put up for bid by wouldbe owners. This system is often called a franchise system. It was introduced in baseball with the formation of the National League in NB  and later adopted by the other North American leagues.Although member clubs are corporate entities separate from their leagues they operate only under league auspices. Partly because that relationship is so close and partly because the four major team sports leagues represent the top level of play in the world North American teams almost never play competitive games against outside opponents. National Hockey League NHL and National Basketball Association NBA teams have played against European hockey and basketball teams in preseason exhibitions. The North American league rather than any sport governing body determines the playing rules and scoring rules of its game and the rules under which players join and change teams.The teams are organized with a view to each major city having a team to support. Only the largest cities such as New York Chicago or Los Angeles have more than one team. As such the teams are often referred to as franchises. Even though they are not technically franchises in a business sense the league is organised in a way that assures teams continued existence in the league from year to year which fosters an ongoing connection with the teams supporters. On occasion a league may decide to grow the sport by admitting a new expansion team into the league. Most of the teams in the four major North American pro sports leagues were created as part of a planned league expansion or through the merger of a rival league. Only a handful of teams in the National Hockey League for example existed before becoming part of the NHL. The rest of the teams were created ex novo as expansion teams or as charter members of the World Hockey Association which merged with the NHL in .The best teams in a given season reach a playoff tournament and the winner of the playoffs is crowned champion of the league and in some cases as world champions. American and Canadian sports leagues typically have such playoff systems. These have their roots in long travel distances common in US and Canadian sports to cut down on travel leagues are typically aligned in geographic divisions and feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents in the same division. Due to the unbalanced schedule typical in US and Canadian leagues not all teams face the same opponents and some teams may not meet during a regular season at all. This results in teams with identical records that have faced different opponents differing numbers of times making team records alone an imperfect measure of league supremacy. The playoffs allow for headtohead eliminationstyle competition between teams to counterbalance this.Major League Soccer is a North American league that exhibits some aspects of the European structure because soccer has a European rather than American origin. Major League Soccer is technically not an association of franchises but a single business entity though each team has an owneroperator the team owners are actually shareholders in the league. The league not the individual teams contracts with the players. Unlike teams in the four major sports several Major League Soccer teams qualify to play competitive matches in the CONCACAF Champions League against teams from outside the U.S. and Canada and MLS uses playing rules set by the international governing body of its sport. MLS followed its own playing rules until  when it adopted FIFA rules. In another parallel with the European model both the U.S. and Canada have separate knockout cup competitions during the MLS season that include teams from lower leagues. In the U.S. the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup has had MLS participation from the leagues inception starting with the  cup each competition features all Americanbased MLS sides. Similarly all of Canadas MLS teams compete in the Canadian Championship. However the league structure of MLS follows the North American model with a single premier league and no promotion or relegation. Some other North American systems also have a hierarchical structure but without the promotion and relegation of clubs exhibited in the European model. Instead the sports leagues generally use a minor league system. For example Major League Baseball has an affiliation with Minor League Baseball to develop young talent. Most minor league clubs are independently owned but each one contracts with a major league club that hires and pays players and assigns them to its various affiliated clubs. The minor clubs do not move up or down in the hierarchy by onfield success or failure. Professional ice hockey has a system somewhat similar to baseballs while the National Basketball Association operates a developmental league. The National Football League does not have a minor league system as of  but it has operated or affiliated with minor leagues in the s s s s and the early s.,esports,d2jz6mc,1,t5_2r08k

Might take awhile to get it going but it all depends on the game prize money and spionship money specifically available to keep it funded.           Make sure you have enough to reallyg et it going and sustain itself for at least  months if not a year before you go Live. The worst possibility would be banking it on getting that Big Fish Sponsor or winning an early tournament where failure to get  or the other dooms the team to financial ruin.

8933119,0,t1_d7lm1kc,Agreed. Ive been around eSports for a long time before there was really any money behind it. I was listening to some of the first eSports shoutcasts in Tribes on a winamp plugin before Being able to Watch others play was even a real thing. So My Definition of eSports is pretty lose but to me there is a difference between a game being an eSport a game being a Professional eSport and eSports as a big business by itself and I understand that most people tend to lean towards that definition.            G Esports is paying their new roster a salary so that playing RL is a full time job. To me that is indicative of an eSport. But it wont be cemented until their are   maybe  Orgs all paying that kind of money for the top talent in the game. I will be very interested to see how many more big orgs step into the mix when the current RLCS Ends NovDec to get in before RLCS begins. I expect at least  more based on the current talent at the top not enough teams have distanced themselves from the masses to earn full pay contracts but hope for more. ,esports,d7lmnh8,1,t5_2r08k

10921976,0,t3_5vzspc,gt   people generally dont think of pinball when they think of esports but the story of how pinball narrowly avoided being classified as gambling is a really good story. At the end of the day what matters is whether something is a good story or not. Id wager that most esports players have pretty boring stories since they were spending their time playing video games instead of you know doing things that make good stories.,esports,de6ixnf,8,t5_2r08k

11349240,0,t1_dfhmppc,Its less an issue of fielding that many rosters its more an issue of fielding that many rosters at a reasonably similar skill level. There will of course be the best and worst teams as always but at that many teams with the current age of the game that gap will be way too large to make investment into the lower end teams worth the value. That means that while doubling the team in Morgan Stanleys calculation doubles the investment it really doesnt. Investors are not stupid they wont invest into a bottom tier team even if it is the only investment left.,esports,dfieyvc,1,t5_2r08k
