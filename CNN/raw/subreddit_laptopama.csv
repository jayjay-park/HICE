1042875,0,t3_25yrgj,I cant help you out with a review as Im currently digging for them myself. The only thing holding me back from getting this laptop is the negative reviews about the wifi. Im worried that it might not be able to connect while Im on campus which is pretty much the only place Ill need it to connect to the internet. ,laptopama,chmtvbm,2,t5_2xqtm

1444475,0,t3_29zace,Hi thanks for the AMA.Can you try to install a temperature reading program for example SpeedFan which is free bloatwarefree and lighteasy to use and let us know the temperature levels when you play demanding games on highest playable settings?How many hours of battery time do you get when using power saving mode andor only doing light activities word browsing light webpages etc.?Also for gods sake do not put your hot computer on a pillow! It will only cause it to overheat. Use something flat and hard instead to allow heat to escape.,laptopama,cixcaii,1,t5_2xqtm
2234820,0,t1_clnsqe4,Not sure. I havent had any issues with it at all other than in school but the wifi at school sucked on my old laptop and my friends as well so I dont think it is my capabilities.As of at home I havent noticed any problems. It seems to keep up with gaming perfectly fine and takes no time at all to load and stream videos. Upon a speed test review between my HTC One M vs. Asus HTC has the ability to do the NETGEAR G here are the results.Note these are ran at the exact same time. Yes my internet sucks at night. Haha. Usually on my laptop I run ish ms  download and  upload but Charter internet is the most up and down internet. And I know this isnt the most accurate way to test it but they are both done from the speedtest.net website.NETGEAR HTC G  ms Download . Mbps Upload . MbpsNETGEAR Asus  ms DL . UL .NETGEAR Standard HTC  ms DL . UL .NETGEAR Asus  ms DL . UL .As you can see these were done within  minutes of each other my internet is terrible at night it runs  Mbps during the day haha. But my laptop easily keeps up with my phone new when it isnt in G Internet. I do wish the Asus was capable of G but it hasnt suffered any problems for me at all that I have noticed.,laptopama,clnwdv2,2,t5_2xqtm
2422369,0,t3_2mz5mp,I grabbed this for  as well. The random dropping of multifinger gesture control on the trackpad is driving me insane. I have no idea what causes it  it just seems intermittent  and resetting the device always fixes it.

3683750,0,t1_cqc3br6,It definitely runs warmer than a lot of laptops but the fans dont really rev up unless Im doing something intensive.  Ive used it on my lap just playing some indie games and surfing the web and such without it getting too uncomfortable.  The heat is largely directed out the back of the system so if youre using it on a desk or with a lap desk its not really an issue as it doesnt ever become uncomfortable on the palmrest or anything.,laptopama,cqc6783,1,t5_2xqtm

5135855,0,t3_3kglab,Let me guess. You saw it on Newegg. Im wondering if this is a good laptop as well so if someone could help us out it would be appreciated.As for system specs I dont know much about the M but it should be able to run both. The CPU on the other hand is a bit more iffy. DayZ requires a Intel DualCore . GHz while Planetside  requires a Core i or better. The i is clocked at . Ghz. The CPU of the laptop is listed in the title and falls below both games minimum requirement. Id guess that a Broadwell . GHz is better than a Lynnfield . GHz. But will it run those games? Ive managed to run some games with a minimum of . GHz on a . GHz laptop so you could probably get DayZ running on it. As for Planetside  you might not be able to run it.Also Newegg has two versions of this laptop for sale. One with GB of VRAM and one with  GB of VRAM. If they couldnt get the GTX  to work properly with  GB of VRAM I cant see how a M could use  GB of VRAM properly.EDIT After a bit of research it turns out that the GTX M is actually a GTX M with a higher clockspeed. Source Ive also realized that almost all games that require more than  GB of VRAM probably wont run on this laptop anyway.,laptopama,cv528ua,1,t5_2xqtm
5215997,0,t1_cvekpoq,The trackpad is a bit meh. I mean it does the job alright but its nothing special. The left and right click buttons arent so great but the keyboard is an abosolute joy to type on! The steelseries keyboard is really nice. I use a seperate mouse so the trackpad doesnt bother me.Battery life is so so for a gaming laptop. I have the M version so the battery life isnt excellent when gaming . hrs tops but in normal usage itll last . hours which I think is reasonable for laptop of this sizepower.For thermals I guess it depends on what you are comfortable with I use speedfan to monitor temps and in everyday usage the max temp I get on the cores is about  degrees C. The maximum temperature of some area in the laptop occassionally reaches  degrees C according to speedfan. Below  degrees the fans are barely noticeable after that the built in fan profile ramps up a little and they are noticeable but they dont stay on too long. When gaming the max temperature Ive hit has been  degrees which you can definately feel coming through the keyboard in some places I think the GPU is towards the right handside. You dont feel it on the WASD keys only near the numeric keypad. Cant vouch too much for the fan noise at these temps as I game with a noise cancelling headset on but there is a button on the keyboard which ramps the fans up to maximum and they get really really loud like it almost sounds like the laptop is going to take off loud.Its also a finger print magnet.Dont think that Im hating on this laptop I absolutely love it. It looks great performs excellently doesnt weigh too much has a great screen for a TN panel is glorious to type on and is pretty well priced! Feel free to ask anything else ,laptopama,cvepxs2,2,t5_2xqtm
5546327,0,t3_3qztz8,As Saprtandog suggested try suggastalaptop but rpcmasterrace might also be useful. Try to give more information bit rate frame rate video length etc. and they may be able to help you. Right now we dont know how much video is being converted in  hours so we dont have anything to compare your current performance against. Try to find your processor number i is a wide family with many models and improvements over the years if you can. Even the year of of your macbook would help. Also let them know what program you are currently using to convert. I cant really give any brand advice between your choices without any models or specs to compare but I can say that I am partial to Toshiba and HP for reliability ymmv.ampnbspIm not sure why you would want to convert p to k since you will just be making it bigger not higher quality but if thats what you need I wont question.ampnbspHope this helps!,laptopama,cwkkn0x,1,t5_2xqtm

5832484,0,t1_cwm6b1r, With the Hybrid IntelGTX M mode enabled e.g. Nvidia Optimus I receive about . hours of battery life on the Performance setting via the ControlCenter power options. With Power Saving enabled I believe it locks the CPU at around Mhz for all  threads I can push out about . hours on a full charge. Ive had it on my lap on top of a blanket in bed for the last  minutes while I browse Reddit and YouTube and all internal components havent gone past C. Its a decently cooled laptop. In their ControlCenter you can set your own custom fan profiles. By default the fans wont spin up until the CPU reaches C under this setting. I leave the mode on automatic all day long and dont really notice the fan noise but thats always an option for you if fan noise is such a big issue. The keyboard is one of the better notebook keyboards Ive used yet. Very little flex but keys have a nice tactile firm press.. etc. I feel like the backlight is a little too dim at its highest setting for me but I can look past that. I have yet to notice any key ghosting..maybe I lucked out?,laptopama,cxk5yzo,1,t5_2xqtm

7135578,0,t3_42grpn,The Pros Theres been no issues whatsoever with the display driver or seeing yellow coming up as a mustard green color that people were reporting. The display is actually quite nice and vibrant with colors relatively richThe build of the laptop is very nice and feels like a premium device that youre getting at a very reasonable priceThe weight of the laptop is actually a lot lighter than I expected. The laptop feels very compact in your hands and when I was physically comparing it to the weight of the macbook air  in I didnt feel a noticeable difference despite the zenbook being slightly heavier at . lbs vs. the . lbs of the macbook airThe keyboard provides a great typing experience and is probably one of the best keyboards Ive encountered  Having fully tested out the battery life in all scenarios yet but so far Ive been getting a respectable . hrs browsing watching some video installinguninstalling apps The consMy biggest concern before buying this laptop was the unstable poor hinge quality others had mentioned. So far it seems like its holding up fine BUT as some reviewers have mentioned the screen is a bit wobbly and doesnt fully stay put when youre carrying the laptop w the lid opened. Instead the screen will just tilt back so Im not sure if this is a sign of weak hinges or what but well see over time how it does.Theres been a plethora of software related issues that are just very annoying. Im not sure if its Asus to blame or Windows . These included the battery  indicator decreasing abnormally fast despite getting the expected battery usage. For example during the first few days of use as soon as I unplugged the laptop from being fully charged at  it would drop to . The Ge Force Experience application as part of the Nvidia driver update also would not open once I installed the new Windows  updates that were available. Theres been some apps that I have tried uninstalling but cant seem to uninstall despite there being an uninstall button available.The speed of the laptop has been hit or miss. At times it seems horribly slow and glitchy with programs and apps taking longer than they should to open up. But then at other times it seems relatively fast. So I need more time to use it on a day to day to really accurately gauge the speed. ,laptopama,d1p8j49,1,t5_2xqtm
