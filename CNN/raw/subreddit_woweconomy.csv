72151,0,t3_1uvsy5,Yes they do on a regular basis. But as others have said the majority of my sales are also in the g range. A lot of it depends on the rarity of the item in question. Something that is super common put up for k is going to sit there but a rare piece that isnt commonly seen on your realm may very well sell in a reasonable amount of time.  Speaking of that another thing to consider is how long youre willing to post it before it sells. Those of us who have k auctions posted every day a single item not selling isnt going to make a massive difference. If youre only selling a handful of items it may be more significant and more frustrating. ,woweconomy,cemn64m,1,t5_2v9u2

526430,0,t3_205v6u,Why herbmining on the DK if youre not even having an orebased profession? Seems like a waste of a profession slot that would be better spent on enchanting or jewelcrafting.Alchemy is great when paired with jewelcrafting but without a jewelcrafter your only real decent income is with the daily CD which obviously has severe limits on how much it can actually make you. You definitely want an alchemist eventually but focus on JC before alchemy IMO.Inscription will be great if youre willing to use it. I know a lot of people who level inscription decide they dont like the glyph market and dont use it. So its basically a wasted profession slot. If you know you like Inscription as a goldmakign profession then yes go for it its a great choice but if youre meh about it I wouldnt make it one of your first. Id instead go JCEnchanting on the first toon AlchemyInscription on the second then fill in as needed as you roll more toons.

Along with those be sure hes selling three of each of the Tinkers Gear. If investment capitalmats are hard to come by for him have him focus on Smooth Rigid Quick and Sparkling Tinkers Gears since theyll sell much more quickly and often.If he has the SoH try to keep a Lord Blastingtons Scope of Doom on the AH at all times as well.Thatll be the easiest ways for him to make gold with current mats. But heres an idea. Have him go to Zangarmarsh and learn to make the Zapthrottle Mote Extractor if he doesnt already have it. Have him fly around in the BC areas where the gas clouds are found SMV  FireShadow Nagrand  Air Zangarmarsh  Water IIRC though I could be off and extract them for a day and sell the motes on the AH.

782779,0,t3_233kdr,Any time Ive started a new server I automatically look to transmog flipping. On my latest server transition it wasnt as good of a rate as Phats but it was close with K in two weeks on a high pop server USThrallH. This was done selling every BoE item I obtained being incredibly frugal as I leveled and purchasing good deals when I found them to flip.Initially I stopped really keeping track once I hit k with  transmog items in  weeks but after having  just checked I now have  items with k gold with a total from about  weeks of the starting date. Not the best rate but considering that is only from transmog flipping its pretty good IMHO.You can make gold on new servers you just need to find some good markets to run with on your new server and to be persistent. Everyone is quick to jump on the shuffling or inscription bandwagon look for other routes to make the gold like Phat did stick with your new strategy for a few weeks before reevaluating and Im sure you will have success.Good luck on your new server!,woweconomy,cgt97xu,2,t5_2v9u2

2014930,0,t3_2htnii,Honestly unless youre strapped for startup cash your best bet is to figure out a reasonable crafting cost then set that  margin for AH cut and profit as your min post price and undercut everyone by c Mine is gs based on buying herbs at about g a stack. Your standard post price should be something like g or so. Make  of every glyph you can sell  if youre on a mediumhigh pop server. Repost as frequently as you can. Youll figure out the best posting times by tracking when other people tend to repost. Glyphs are about volume and posting at the right time to get the most lowest posted price time. The s deposit means you really dont have to worry how often you repost. Some glyphs may never sell but youll make it up elsewhere some glyphs may sell at g one week then g the next week depending whos posting and how theyre setup. On my medium pop server I find that I have  of  glyphs I know below my min sell price at any given time. The only other thing to watch out for is that shoulder enchant sales are slowing down so your consumption of Starlight may mean you will stockpile with no worthwhile place to go with it so you may need to raise your glyph min sell price.,woweconomy,ckvzuxk,2,t5_2v9u2

4074018,0,t3_3790sf,Once you have a good idea of how to set up TSM handling a new market is simply a matter of setting up a new group. Its incredibly easy to manage multiple markets at once. In fact its what I recommend every goblin do. If you diversify your holdings it means itll be very difficult for one player to force you out of the goldmaking market entirely. The only thing that can be vaguely timeconsuming is buying mats for multiple markets at once. Ive set up a trade chat macro that I spam for herbs and ore to buy in bulk. This saves me time from having to buy it individually on the AH. The rest I set up in a mats group in TSM that I just check once or twice a day to see what the AH prices are currently.Always have stock in reserve. For example Ill tend to craft  enchants but only post  at a time. One big mistake I see a lot of people make is trying to buy out everything in a market to reset the price to something much higher than average. Whenever I see this happen I just laugh and undercut. Not only has that other guy just bought all my current auctions but now Im benefitting from his attempt to fix prices.Once you spend less time and effort trying to control a certain market you have more time to invest in actually crafting and posting auctions. It takes a certain amount of time to post ish auctions at once. Focus on quantity rather than controlling the price on just one item. I have about k of stock on the AH at any given time. Selling just  of that gets me k which incidentally is generally my average amount sold each day.,woweconomy,crknxrh,3,t5_2v9u2

4262627,0,t1_cs63wxk,While I agree that you should be able to play the game the way you want to play the game Blizzard still needs to keep the economy in line. Generating several thousand gold per toon out of thin air every day is just insane. This has introduced WAY more gold than the obsidium ore shuffle or the shoulder inscription shuffle which were introducing incredible amounts of gold to the economy. Those two were nerfed to the ground for that exact same reason.You can still use your alts to support your main and that is fine.

Ive been back in the game almost a month now and dont even have one garrison fully up and running yet and that one is a long ways away from running at full capacity.Tbh I dont understand what they were thinking when they released this content to begin with... surely they could have done the math  garrisons k  month and  mins of upkeep per day  k  month k gold per hour...

Bank alts on each realm do my purchasing and mailing to each max level toon for resupply.The huge majority of my time in WoW is freetime spent raiding and brainstorming new avenues of profit.

4392254,0,t1_cskq4yh,I just briefly Googled what you were referring to regarding Steam so sorry if my answer isnt onpoint but most of your questions are around the same topic how software developers get paid. I think people today expect software to be free and I can understand why people would be against paying for mods  addons. Im not saying that I dont have the same expectations but I do have a level of appreciation for the amount of work that goes into creating these things. I could write a book on this topic but I think the current economy when it comes to the internet  tech is totally advertisingbased. Thats how companies like Google Facebook and Twitter are surviving on otherwisefree products. This also makes it really hard for smaller projects to make any money at all. TSM certainly isnt big enough to pay anybodys salary from advertising money. Obviously with TSM Premium were looking for a new source of revenue but the number of people who will buy premium is a small percentage of the total number of TSM users. So if we wanted to pay salaries from TSM wed need many many times the number of users we currently have in order to get that small percentage of people who buy premium to be a significant source of income. What Im getting at is with how the software industry is structured today its really hard to make money without a very large userbase.So with that all being said nobody is working on TSM as their job either full or part time. The money we get from premium is first going to our many hundreds of dollars a month of costs server software licenses etc and then being shared among us. Even if TSM made enough money to support me I dont think I would do that. As I said in another reply I love my job and not that I dont love working on TSM but the type of development required for TSM isnt really my passion. So yes for everybody involved it is mostly a labor of love.Personally I find it extremely rewarding both personally and in terms of improving my technical skills to work on TSM. With there now being  of us developers its also been a great experience for me to learn how to manage a team of people and keep people engaged which Im definitely not the best at.

4860307,0,t3_3h7vb5,Considering I am of the minority that seems to frequent woweconomy subreddit I actually sell for  hours at a large discount relying on those that buy low and sell high.  I have  lvl  rd tier garrison toons on my server and just by playing here and there and doing a daily regimen in my garrisons I have an enormous amount of flippable materials.  Each toon has maxed professions  BS  Tailors  Enchanter  JC  Scribes  LW  Eng  Skinner and  MinerHerbalist for gathering.  Each toon has an Inn  Aside from main and PVP toons they all HAD the salvage yard for tmog items and follower gear upgrades as well as the once profitable now paltry vendor gear.  I now only have the Salvage Yard on  toons as it is still more profitable than some profession huts.  All toons DE every BoE Rare and BoP Epic and sell every green.  There are notable exceptions which remain profitable but all in all I hate spending too much time on the AH.I attempted to sell tmog greens for a while but it was more work than it was worth.Note I love running old raids and my transmog obsession keeps this fresh and fun for me.  I sell every old profession mat I come across in stacks of  undercutting all listed auctions and have  guild banks full of partial stacks just waiting to be filled and sold.With the enormous amount of materials that pile up from all of the rush orders that have been available I just split up and send all mats to their respective professions craft items which I sell for approx  the standard rate and sell the stacks of mats that will net me more than the items they make.  I only do  hours because on most items it costs more to leave them on longer and almost everything goes the first cycle through the AH.  I have a few people that at first were annoyed with me because they were cornering a market and kept trying to undercut me and said I am ruining the market.  They now know that they cant undercut me as I undercut them even at points of losing gold to teach them it is better to just buy my stock and resell them at the rate they want.  Also if something doesnt sell after  AH cycles its vendored or DEdBanked for a later date.  I wish I could get rid of the now unavailable tailoring pattern Chromatic Cloak that has survived some  AH cycles.I know with a little more time I could sell for a huge amount more than what I already make but with  toons that just doesnt feel worth it to me.  This way I still play all my toons and enjoy playing rather than having it feel like a job or or get burdened by the drudgery of it all.  Lastly I have  d tier Pet Menageries and have all my  unique pets as rare and nearing max level on  of those.  I sell all the pets I get from there as well and even use the tokens to buy leveling stones to max out any pets I come across in old raids or old standbys that will always sell as they are considered part of the pet battle meta.So basically just from playing with minimal actual chore work harvesting herbsore I pay for mine and  friends subscriptions they compensate me with money outside of game at a discount rate because they suck at making gold.  I buy a TCG mount approximately once a month outfit my toons with  ilvl gear and still manage to make k gold every weekweek and a half.  By no means am I close to gold capping all of my toons but have a few million to throw around at any time.  The first million took something like  years the second  months the third only took a month but it has slowed considerably since .. Though all of this is lucrative without being a drag I dont have time to do progression raids but with all of the extra gold laying around I could always buy a Mythic run at the end of the expansion if the urge hit me.  Sorry for the long explanation and I hope this helps anyone who is struggling.TLDR I sell for  hour cycles at  the going rate for fast turn arounds. I know this isnt necessarily practical but it works for me as I enjoy myself while still turning a fairly large profit. The rest is just explaining why I take an impractical approach and why it works for me.,woweconomy,cu76fno,1,t5_2v9u2
4884257,0,t3_3hrlbq,It depends for crafted items I set the mimimum to be  crafted cost.  This makes sure I never sell the item for less than it is worth.  This also tells me if the item is worth making in the first place as I can look at the current lowest buyout and average price. Generally I use lowest buyout to decide and then check the normal crafting price if the  crafting price is above the current lowest buyout and average price I craft it.    For items I commonly craft I have a group for buying up stock that is set at  market price and whenever I see mats below that point I will buy them up.  This means my crafting cost is also never really the  as well.  This keeps my profit per sell at generally .When flipping materials I go by the market price generally I buy at  market value and sell when above .  You want to make sure you are listing less than the daily sell number sold most of the time.   This is very steady profit the downside of this is it requires a lot of checking the AH.  I stopped doing this because I just dont enjoy it and there are better options for me that while they might be riskier are better profit.  The trick I have found is volume for example on TMOGspetsmounts sure I might buy some that just never sell well or drop in price the majority I make money on.

5004848,0,t3_3jhoqp,There are bots. Theyre quite hard to detect because someone sitting at their keyboard sniping and a bot look pretty much identical to Blizzard on their end. To prove its a bot youd have to look at logs of how often and long someone is sniping and how fast theyre responding. I dont think the average GM has those powers so its the kind of thing that probably needs to be escalated internally to their team that investigates such issues. Also were talking about less than some small faction of a percent of people who would notice or care enough to have an AH botter bother them or affect their style of gameplay so theres little incentive for Blizzard to really put any resources towards stopping them. One common complaint in this subreddit and among the gold community is that Blizzard really doesnt seem to care about the economy until something is so broken or unfair its affecting a large percentage of players. Detecting AH bots isnt probably even on the radar of their team thats working on bot prevention. Botting dungeons on stolen accounts and pvp botters are their thing.  I got a day ban for manipulating the economy for buying all of the crescent saberfish and  food the day . was released. Best I can tell I pissed off a couple of the raiding guilds and they mass reported me for cheating. Yet it took me many weeks of documenting and complaining to get action from Blizz on someone using a bot to cancel and relist their auctions.

So if TSM sees no item X posted it will post at  of its worth I use the TSM desktop app to get data from the markets of the servers I play on. Basically a source is some set of criteria that says based on X Y Z this item is worth about this much gold If I rem right TSM has about  different sources it can consider. I then post below that to help encourage the buying of the item. my max is  so if tsm sees no item X posted it will post at a maximum price of  my normal price is  as to undercut competitors items that have been posted.I would recommend watching the videos at this channelas for crates yup..mind numbing boredom.

7247766,0,t3_4eoraa,I feel like a broken record but Primals are valuable for crafting a host of BC items. While Vanilla armor is usually highly valued for tmog in my opinion the crafted BC items are engaging because they are often unique and the recipes are gated behind rep walls AldorScryer Consortium Cenarion Expedition Ashtongue Vileswarm. While the Felsteel Reaper is well known other items like the Fel Edged Battleaxe are beautiful models and they are generally rareless than  available across server. Demand for tmog will probably provoke some crafters to dust off old recipes but they are going to need people like you to feed them as everyone will be playing Legion content for a few months.Of all the Primals I find Air the most difficult to farm. Primal Water while a key element is relatively easy to farm. Fire is used quite a bit and has tended to be the most expensive over the past few months but in my opinion it is easier to get than air and shadow. Mana is less useful and an okay farm but it is currently used in the enchant recipes  so it might become more lucrative.Aside from that I am stocking up on bolts as I dont want to bolt when the time comes. Many of the highest value nonspecialtycloth tailoring items require Imbued Netherweave or Imbued Frostweave. Netherweave comes so easily that I am not sure it will pay off to bank it raw. But the bolts or the Imbued form add Arcane Dust might be a decent gamble. Frostweave can get really expensive on my server. I think it is a safer bet. The imbued form requires Infinite Dust.tldr Yes as a crafter I am wondering where all the materials will come from to meet wardrobe demands in the first few months when we are all running Legion rather than farming the old stuff. Primals take timeyou are lucky to hit double digit primals in an hour and many of these pieces require .Arcane Dust and Infinite Dust are key to making some of the nonspecialty cloth tailoring pieces. ,woweconomy,d220ptw,3,t5_2v9u2

7257037,0,t1_d23016r,Well Ive only been in the market a week and a half.  The only items I really seek out are   socket    socket and any of those with a tertiary stat.   The reason is that there is a limited supply of the mythic items especially ones that are warforged or socketed.  If you want to significantly increase your ilvlpower fast this is simply the best choice since crafted gear cannot have sockets or be  or have tertiary stats.  Therefore I think people with money are willing to pay a premium for them.  I think at these high ilvls as well people are definitely willing to pay quite a bit more for the tertiary stats since theyre so rare.  I still will buy up most HFC BoEs if I think I can flip them but I am noticing that the   socket or  warforges are less competitive.  Some of the items sell fast some dont.  Heres some examples   socket  leech mail boots bought at k sold at k within a day.   socket mail waist bought at k sold at k within a day   cloth belt  bought at k sold at k within a day I was lucky here because the other belts priced around k had expired or were bought up so I had the opportunity to reset.  These were at  MV when I sold them but around the regional value.  cloth boots bought at k sold at k with  days.    plate boots bought at k trying to sell at k for over a week now.  Ive sold some   socket  warforged as well usually selling within a week or so.  The  items Ive bought pretty cheap around k and can usually sell them for k but I am accumulating a rather large stock now.  They are taking over a week to sell and are much more competitive.  Every few days someone will post a high ilvl item at around  MV and I almost immediately snatch it up.  I think the two worst items though are the cloth and leather belts since they have versatility on them.    Anyone else care to weigh in?Edit  Some   socket plate boots I bought at k just sold for k took about a week.   ,woweconomy,d232nmx,1,t5_2v9u2

Then I submitted it to the hacks team and all  botting accounts disappeared within hours.  They are definitely aware of the operation.If this guy doesnt fit the pattern of the multiserver bot army and seems to be a legit player Id just diversify what you are selling.  You cant expect to rule a high volume market without many hours spent camping so if thats not your play style youll need to find more  niche markets.  Might be lower volume but if you arent getting undercut every  minutes the profit margins should be better.  Also try chatting with them.  Ive made friends with most of the big AH players on my server and have made whitelist agreements so everyone gets an even chance at the sale without the constant undercutting wars. EDIT if you are going to try chatting with a camper do NOT approach him with a whiny tone and you should not even broach the topic of whitelisting until youve had a few friendly chats.   Ask him his opinion on some gold making idea or what he thinks about how wardrobe is going to change the transmog market or just ask if he knows how to do some random thing in TSM.

Also Blizzard is doing something with the Scarlet set but it is not clear how it will work at all and there are no character copies to test it. There are datamined tokens to add the entire scarlet set to your wardrobe in Mail and Plate whether these are rare BMAH items or given if you have enough pieces of the mail set is still yet to be seen.

7475620,0,t1_d2r95ln,gt Your post implied that youd be willing to sell an enchant where you costed the temporal at the price of the dust used to create work orders. . dust   temporal Thats what I called a big mistake.Correct that is my current strategy.  I explained in the last post why it is certainly not a big mistake it is only a potentially small mistake and half the time it isnt a mistake as in it results in no economic loss when enchants sell higher than temporals.  To summarize making an extra g per enchant is really not worth the micromanagement time and really given it is a loss probably only half the time the expected potential loss is closer to g.gt if you cant sell your enchants or your crystals for a significant profit over the cost of the work orders around g per crystal then youre doing a fair bit of work and using up a building slot for not much profit.I agree there.  In both my posts I mention that crystals are g and as you say crystals made from dust cost g though I dont think I mentioned that these are conservativeworst case figures.  Even in that scenario g economic increase per crystal means g economic increase per day because . crystals per day.  But yeah if converting from dust to crystals produces little or no economic improvement I agree you are probably better off using another building.gt Youd have to care a fair bit about the DE abilityThis is certainly more opinion based.  Currently for me the enchanting hut produces g less per day than the Alch hut.  The values used here are profit amounts as in net of inputs.  The Alch section considers shuffling to stones or selling the catalysts raw.I used to trade in mats to the daily traders through the daily quest on all toons when Savage blood prices were usually double the cost of those mats.

Each player could only try for one shot a day per toon so the only players that stockpiled a ton of them are the ones who bought them up which at worst led to an early demand for them.  The ValentinesEaster mounts on the otherhand most likely had some players afk farm  or even  which is just going to mean those never really will go back up.On top of that the Grumpus mount is actually kind of interesting again as opposed to the bird mounts.,woweconomy,d30vzhm,1,t5_2v9u2

8146393,0,t3_4qnsbd,Hello. I have a whole list of questions that I would love to get an answer for.  . What items do you suggest flipping without having any proffesion? Like buying an ore for gold then reselling for gold without doing anything.  Legion is close I belive I cant just flip Felblight like you did or Savage Blood . What proffesions do you suggest to get for auction flipping?  . What do you think about transmogs? I see you got a lot of profit from them. How much time does it take for one to sell and  how are the numbers looking?    EDIT Just learned how to set a group and modules for it. Now after a search of things I was interested in buying  I found out that A LOOT of items are placed at a lower than marketdb price... To flip those I am supposed to just buy them all? Heres a screenshot to make it more clear.,woweconomy,d4vugeg,1,t5_2v9u2

The only thing I can think of for it to reduce fps is processing power as it isnt graphically intensive.. however it may also be worth trying reducing your graphical settings as they have just made it so the graphics settings have  default options and if your game is already running slower due to this its a possibility that the processing power usually reserved for tsm posts is being used elsewhere but this is highly unlikely and is only a theory without being able to look myself.,woweconomy,d6kcx2h,1,t5_2v9u2

At g youre nowhere near this  youre speaking of unless you buy your cloth under s each.You normally do this with a few hundred bolts at a time and  your yield per DE is  dust. So your g has a chance of turning into g. When you average out say  bolts you almost always come out way ahead than where you started. As for time consumption Its a shuffle. Shuffles always take time to do and always yield more gold than you put in. If AFK crafting bolts and watching NetflixYoutube is too much for you or not having the stamina to mash a button or run CKS for an hour then perhaps shuffling isnt for you.

Thats why every goblin worth their salt should diversify on them probably sell  out of  you farm right now and put the other one away for some time. Even if youd have to write off  of the gains you make right now easily khour last week itd still be pretty nice gold hour. And thats if they suddenly got worthless which  lets be honest  is unlikely to happen.gt These will very likely never even sniff the value of something like a Haunted Memento even given the same timeframe.Haunted Memento is  years old how do you know how the market will look like in  years? Also  and thats another point a lot of people are missing  these items can be great ways to inflationproof some of your assets. Even if the price for the Fel Spreader wont make huge jumps in perceived value which I think it will but we it will surely pick up in relation to its current absolute value because of the sheer amount of gold that blizzard is flooding the markets with.Now  Im not saying there could be a price crash on them closely after the launch when everyone is panicselling because they desperately want to cash in especially the people that didnt farm them themselves but bought them at fixed prices but eventually this item will prove to have been a sound investment Im very sure of it.,woweconomy,d6s2czj,4,t5_2v9u2

8830739,0,t3_505nma,Hey guys I am pleased to announce that Ive found a workaround for the invalid import string error that some of us have been getting Click Options gt Profiles gt and under New create a new profile called something like Temp. TSM will automatically switch to the new profile. Create a group for whatever you are trying to import.  Paste Sheyrahs import string like usual except when you get the invalid import string error just keep tapping the enter key repeatedly. It will eventually import. Now under the importexport tab generate an export string making sure to check both boxes to preserve subgroup structure and include operations alternatively if you dont want to use Sheyrahs operations this is a good way to remove them by unchecking that box. Go back to Options gt Profiles and switch back to your original profile. Import the group as usual by creating a group clicking the importexport tab and pasting in the new import string you generated.Im not sure why this fixes the issue but Ive done this multiple times and every time it corrects the problem for me. I think it has something to do with the Replace popups that come up when importing Sheyrahs operations but who knows when pasting to a clean profile you dont get the popups and therefore you can use the repeatedenterkey trick... otherwise the popups prevent you from doing so.,woweconomy,d79bxtc,4,t5_2v9u2

8990566,0,t3_53d716,Honestly in a couple months six figure daily incomes will go bye bye. You might be able to do six figure days on the weekends but weekdays no way. Happens every expansion you make a ton at the beginning and things start to taper off as crafted item price and mat price start to come more and more together. Unless there is something drastically different about this expansion than any of the others the way to keep profits turning is to invest in a combination of long term and short term markets. Long term markets are stuff like xmog pets and mounts I recommend to start investing in these now since most goblins are not paying attention to them at the moment since the tradeskill markets are currently so lucrative. Short term markets that typically still stay worthwhile throughout the life of an expansion are enchanting jc and alchemy. At the end of the day its all about diversity get your hands in as many markets as you can and you will stay successful all expansion long.,woweconomy,d7sj074,1,t5_2v9u2

9078991,0,t3_54mjsv,I am lazy with my groups. I mostly let TSM do the work to determine pricing based on realm and region history.Price fluctuations are dealt with automatically.Volatile swings in markets like mats can be dealt with by using conservative min prices and posting at Normal price to catch the up swing when the market gets bought out by a crafter.Just an example but most of pricing is based off a combination of realm and region pricing so something likeMin  avgdbmarket dbregionmarketavgNormal  avgdbmarket dbregionmarketavgMax  avgdbmarket dbregionmarketavg,woweconomy,d835bcs,1,t5_2v9u2

Problem with this is what if it never does? If the price hovers for now at  then drops to  and nobody bothers with it anymore then youre stuck with a HUGE stockpile and your profit margins will drop significantly. In my opinion the only real way to truly unload  of these is to utilize them yourself. On the other hand if you obliterate pants you will be looking at  pairs of crafted pants. An investment cost of roughly  including all materials at above prices. Granted you will be selling  obliterum which will also take some time but your profit here is closer to  in what I would imagine is less time required to sell  obliterum than it would be for  felhide. ,woweconomy,d85h3e4,2,t5_2v9u2

At Rank  Felwort gathering you unlock the ability to gather seeds from any herb node you farm and then plant those seeds in fertile plots which you dont see until you get the ability to gather seeds yourself to gather herbs from them. You can plant any herb seed in any plot and gather them you werent hurting anything by gathering with them except if you gather a node that they then cant gather in time before despawn.If they didnt miss any herbs then they were just being douchey and wanted you away from their little spot. People in group finder have groups going requiring Felwort R because the more people with it that farm the node the more seeds the more herbs are planted the more everyone farms.

Theres no point in farming some random vanilla ore because people are going to be interesting in moplegion ores right now. MoP ores due to Sky Golem.  When i do the math I usually just pull out a calculator and tsm to see if the flip will work.  ex. Ghost iron ore price x is that higher than ghost iron bar prices.  Watching Phat Lewts Guide on TSM His channel is on the right side of the reddit page with the rest of the content creators is a very good way to understand the basics of TSM and could help you with your problem.

Like I said it is  extras for potions so youd need to figure out how many extra flasks you get on average and adjust the formulas accordingly.As for your auctioning operationIf you want to sell flasks at crafting cost  g youd simply set your minimum price to Crafting  .  g or .  Crafting  g like you said.There is no option to change how TSM calculates all of this as it simply bases all of this on the information provided by Blizzard. And according to this information you get  flask per craft.Using a seperate operation for flasks isnt too bad though I personally would use seperate operations even if there were no proccs at all. It gives you far greater control.On a different note I would strongly recommend to divide all your minimum prices by . to account for the AH cut.So instead of Crafting  .  g Id use Crafting  .  g  ..Otherwise you might end up with less than g profit or even lose gold depending on the crafting cost.,woweconomy,d9dv615,1,t5_2v9u2

This is why behavior analysis is the much more reliable way to determine if someone is botting.

If you cancel your post to repost it at a cheaper price you lose your deposit your lose your chance at a sale you lower the value of the item and theres nothing to stop them or someone else coming along and undercutting you yet again.I have these two rules for it.  If someone undercuts me by a small amount on some trade goods or items that sell a lot in my region I just leave it. Whatever if theirs sell then mine is next. Let them make less than me.

To add on to this when you see the flow of the market youre wanting to dwell in usually when youre looking to flip and be an AH player which is my area of specialty be sure to buy when the prices are lowest and see when you can anticipate that and list right before peak hours on your realm usually reset day before raids and after raids especially for JC and ench even cooking and incr and alchemy. These all can benefit heavily from this if youre a crafter. If you can actively undercut during this time then awesome more gold for you.! Now if youre just flipping mats then same concept.

9931410,0,t3_5hovwo,Sigh. Once again this thread. I dont know what it will take to get you people to quit trying to hold on to items in fast moving markets. This is one of the worst things you can do as a goblin. In a fast market like current expansion mats the only thing you should ever be thinking about is quick shuffles and flips. Any flippingshuffling intentions outside of the next week at most are going to get you burned. As you can see with the recent bot wave prices can drop at any time unexpectedly. Prices also always trend downward over the course of an expansion so even if they do another ban wave the prices will never rebound to where they were prior. Also history shows that Blizzard only does a ban wave every few months. So we are likely around  months away from the next ban wave. Not to mention the holidays are coming up. Prices of mats always plummet over the holidays. Raiding is reduced so demand is reduced. People are off workschool and get bored and start farming which leads to an increase in supply. An increase in supply and a decrease in demand equals lower prices. Just sell your shit. Then in the future buy more shit and sell that shit too. Thats really all there is to being a goblin. Just keep selling shit. If SLR dipped really low on your server buy it and flip it today. Thats perfectly fine. But its far too risky to even consider holding onto it as a long term investment.,woweconomy,db2363n,8,t5_2v9u2

I think the issue is not a lot of items sell during the day and so theyre just undercutting each other until someone snatches the items.Ive done a little bit with ores and mining but luckily ive got a good mix of farming professions and crafting professions covered so I can play around a little bit.

Of course using the blood of sargeras to trade in for materials will shave off the top of the higher valued materials and NOT of the lower valued materials like leather so this is probably the one factor that keeps skinning profitable aside from the blood of sargeras generating which is the big one.

10674049,0,t3_5slxfm,There is a bunch of confusion going around so heres a rough summery of what this token to b.net balance change will mean. Player A has  gold player B has  gold. Player A buys a token for  and puts it on the AH where player B buys it for  gold and converts it to  b.net balance. Player A now has g and player B g so the total gold in the economy is the exact same. The only person to really get a cut is Blizzard who just made  maybe more if you consider player B is likely to buy some virtual item he never would have bought with his own money.What this does do is dump g that would have just sat in player Bs bank into the active economy as player A not a saver will spend it. Especially in the short term this means a more money rich active economy with tons of more loosely held gold being tossed around. Inflation should be the natural result. But long term this will result in a lower amount of total active and banked gold in the economy. Player A is spending gold and part of that ends up in money sinks. He buys vendor items like mounts or mounts made with expensive vendor parts along with extra fast flying and upgrades he could not previously afford.ConclusionsAt first there should be inflation across the board. As the gold reserves run lower and goblins with stored gold place less value in b.net balance as they already have what they really want the inflation will subside. Long term inflation will depend much more on gold accumulating in the economy as the expansion advances hopefully not to the same extent it did in WoD. Will the decrease in total gold cause deflation? I dont think it will. Most of that gold is coming from richer players and this is sort of a one time shift in gold distribution. I expect active goblins to get much of their gold back in their bank There is not a long term shift of substantially less gold in circulation.Long term the value of the token will permanently rise but more likely moderate than anything too extreme. There is more value in a token now but will that extra value spur players into actual in game time chasing them? Now IS the time to sell especially high value and rarer items as the potential buyer pool is larger. though everything should rise as people stock up on flasks enchants etcif I knew for sure what would happen Id be working at Goldman Sachs this is an educated guess,woweconomy,ddgy4d9,5,t5_2v9u2

I got some gear that are there since a few months now. lowering it doesnt mean it will be guaranteed to sell. if it doesnt sell for the margin you seek and you want to get rich right then it simply means the demand is not there yet not that someone is waiting for you to lower your priceof course for that to work you must not overprice your item you must price it just right at the very beginning. and let that sit forever or until the moment where you know the value will soon drop to  thats the only moment where you can lower your price. happens rarely for big ticket items. end expansion probably.,woweconomy,de9fo36,1,t5_2v9u2

When I press for example F itll move my rd characters game window fullscreened to my main monitor and whatever was there previously will move to my secondary monitor where I have  smaller game windows.If you get toons stuck on things you can get them unstuck with follow and spamming jumping or just switch to that character and move it where it needs to be. Speed increases can be problematic since follow has a max range so its possible for your lead to get too far from your other toons. Currently I run DKs Monks and Pallies and the speed increases are somewhat similar so I can just use them simultaneously with no issues. Mounts cause no issues. You just mount at the same time and follow to move around. ,woweconomy,deachrd,1,t5_2v9u2
10977551,0,t3_5wqldz,This post is made mostly with Raw Gold in mind.You can do normalHeroic Highmaul pretty easily with an at least  toon this was the earliest ilevel i thought of trying it on a DH Havoc.I got hardly any gold compared to doing Cata Raids here.BRFs Franz and Hanz requires  people so cant be solod. Id imagine a few other fights would be rather annoying alone and if you dont have self heal or leechSustain. Blast Furnace comes to mind. Additionally its a really large raid so a ton of time is lost running Id say more so than many other old content raids.HFC can get tricky solo on Normal. Gorefiend might not be possible solo as well.Pandaland. I think Heart of Fear as far as walkingtalking and fighting ratio is the shortest. Also has a healthy amount of trash to try your luck looting. Same for Mogushan.ToT  and SoO are really long and SoO has really long RPs. Though have some pets that might be worth looking into selling on the AH. Not  sure if SoO can be solod now though.I think the majority of the Cata raids have that sweet spot of length to mob and boss ratio that still make them worthwhile. IIRC doing all of them still nets you about k gold. Where as the other raid farms Im not entirely sure come close to that in raw gold and generally will take longer.,woweconomy,deca84m,2,t5_2v9u2

10994090,0,t1_dee3vf8,I figured it out and it works perfectly!Go here You have to sign up and copy and pase your API key at the top to do anything. Then choose the last GET box. Scroll down and choose your realm region item ID and set the format to CSV. Hit Try it out! and it should spit out a URL and what it would look like if you used it. I literally just figured this out but you can choose exactly what info you want by typing the headers from the first line of the Response body. So if you want the ID buyout prices and quantity only IdMinBuyoutQuantity.Copy that url and put this into your spreadsheet importdataURL. I put all my data in a single sheet and made it look nice You can hide the header rows so you dont have  of them. If you do put it all in one sheet or your info is not on the same sheet as whatever youre doing you can Vlookup an item. For example the price of Old War vlookupsheetwhereyoudatais!AZ divide by  since the price is in copper.Then you can do whatever you want with these numbers. Hopefully that helps.

11207783,0,t3_5zzxof,Im not sure how much you made in profit but try not to spend every gold you earn right away on tokens and whatnot. You need to build your capital for reinvestment purposes so that you can consistently produce INCREASES in healthy profits. You need money to make more money. In regards to your investments in herbs this is not really a good time to dump all your liquid into herbs given that your liquid is extremely limited and that a bot wave is going on. If I were you given your situation I would stay away from the farmable Legion mats markets until you can build up enough capital to take potentially massive losses. Flipping herbs is risky in itself. Flipping them with all of your liquid is not exactly a wise investment. ,woweconomy,df2e0xs,3,t5_2v9u2

11259109,0,t1_df6b8ae,It absolutely depends on the realm. I was lucky with my very low pop realm because there were very few goblins there and they all had specialized niches so there are plenty of opportunities for me to make a ton of money. For instance I was the only goblin who had completed the quest for the tailoring bracers for the oblit forge for about . weeks so I was the only person really mass producing them and I made about a million gold off of them. On a high pop server you would never see such a huge profit margin with no competition but also on most low pop servers that wouldnt happen either. There is also almost no competition on enchants so I could reliably buy all the mats for ringneck enchants and sell the enchants for xx the mat price I was still doing this a few months ago  that market has not changed since Legion launched really. Same with buff food for awhile.However the markets for other things are terrible. I can run TSMs sniper for  hours and get ZERO hits whereas on a high pop realm I would get hundreds. Other flips and patchdriven economy changes are a huge bust on the server. Its really hit or miss on what will make you money and its hard to know ahead of time because the server tends to have different trends than the other servers as reported on this subreddit.Its just super hit or miss. You might have a terrible time on a low pop server because nothing sells and prices are low on everything or you might get lucky and be the only person who unlocks a highdemand recipe for weeks. Its more likely that certain markets enchanting and cooking in my case will be overlooked than on a high pop server but its certainly not guaranteed.,woweconomy,df87bov,1,t5_2v9u2

11737599,0,t1_dgqfkpq,Suppose theres nobody who wants the item that would mean its worthless. Then one day a rich asshole decides he wants the Glorious set and is willing to pay k for them. That day the worth of the item should rise to k. Of course the other days it isnt exactly worthless since people will try to be the ones possessing it once the rich asshole comes along.With this in mind the situation becomes quite alike that of a lottery. The thing is with a lottery ticket everyone has tried them everyone knows the chances are low the common people dont have that experience with the hardtosell items thus the price will be high at least until everyone on the server has tried to sell the item.Then theres the fact that the rich asshole will buy the lowest priced pair of legs on the AH the rich asshole might be willing to pay k or even k you can buy out the other hopeful sellers although you can lose money doing that. Point is highrisk items have a complex worth.Im sorry if this ramble doesnt make any sense it was pretty much my thoughts as they came.,woweconomy,dgqhj5p,4,t5_2v9u2
