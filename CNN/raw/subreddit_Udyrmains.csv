6626556,0,t3_46e815,Of course yes even more viable than Devourer.They only nerfed his base stats every build was hurt but AP ratios remain the same. I dont even know why Riot didnt nerfed Udyrs ratios and nerfed his base damage instead.,Udyrmains,d04qrej,3,t5_37nma

8323483,0,t3_4tkfa7,To Riot Phoenix is fine as long as you build Runic Echoes. Because that is the item that led Udyr to be nerfed and Riot also wanted to tune down a bit the Devourer build that made him hit  winrate before Runic Echoes. But nowadays with Bloodrazor growing in popularity Riot didint realize that DevourersGuinsoos rework killed onhit builds and Udyr nerfs didnt suit that change at all now Phantom Hit is gone and Guinsoo became absolute crap. Master Yi is another champ that wasnt nerfed but still got hurt by Devourers removal. Althrough his kit was better desinged for Bloodrazor than Udyr and so is doing better.,Udyrmains,d5hzo8u,1,t5_37nma

9082411,0,t3_54l96l,I usually see people building deadmans mid game but thats not when you should get it. It should basically be bought in a closed game. The mobility is good but if you are going for armor there are better choices for Udyr.,Udyrmains,d83k3va,1,t5_37nma

9769176,0,t3_5f306w,With the jungle changes you can be alot more aggressive and snowball purely off crushing the enemy jungler. So as far as a duelist standpoint goes tiger wins early hard. And the clear speed is only slower by like a few seconds so its not bad. Besides you can buff wolves buff enemy opposite buff or gank with points tiger and get an instakill or burn a summoner.

10495492,0,t1_dcxqhqf,I got a  win rate in high platinum with around  games like the last  weeks of s. Trinity gives you enough attack speed. If you want to build attack speed you go and play Phoenix stance. Tiger is all about the double Q one shot and insane dueling. Plus with  attack speed runes and another  attack speed thats  and you get a lot from your Q and passive you almost reach the cap. And im pretty sure im higher elo than you and a better udyr player especially. ,Udyrmains,dcxrvyu,1,t5_37nma

10876500,0,t1_de0393i,especially since you cant really run anything from the other trees on phx udyr. fervor used to be pretty strong on an onhit build but since it got changed to ad instead of straight up dmg the most viable thing u can do is run windspeakers with more cdr and that isnt actually viable. so i dont even think its the tenacity that makes def tree so good but the fact that all other keystones are quite frankly pretty terrible on phoenix atm.,Udyrmains,de1u0mr,1,t5_37nma
10902751,0,t1_de4ff3t,Yes from what I understand it does. But it only increases the range by about  units so I dont think its worth getting but maybe it could be another option instead of shiv.,Udyrmains,de4jhtl,1,t5_37nma

11692206,0,t3_66t65h,I used to take Thunderlords back when echoes was the thing. Theres nothing wrong with it its just Udyr likes to keep on a target in which case Fervor is better longer engagements are better for Fervor but if youre willing to play around a more hit and run playstyle it can work just fine. It may not be optimal however since you probably will get into many extended fights. ,Udyrmains,dglbvq0,4,t5_37nma
