2465696,0,t3_2ns9ah,It could be very nice but it depends on your family  mine would see it as passiveaggressive.A suggestion preprinted address labels andor envelopes? For whatever reason the part I hate most about writing letters is making out the envelope. The address labels would mean no one would have to look up others addresses and you could add return address labels too. Or you could get envelopes with just the return address preprinted and then pass along sheets of address labels or you could get the envelopes preprinted with both e.g. all have the return address on them and you make up five or  for each recipient.

5011927,0,t3_3jj0vd,Clothes is always a winner with babies.  Books are always great at one my kids were just learning words and really enjoyed those simple books that just had labeled pictures bonus points if they had flaps pulls touchable fabrictexture sounds etc.If there are kid friendly experiences in your area consider a gift certificate to a local childrens museum zoo or aquarium play area pool or wherever.  My kids got a ton of toys from everyone but the gifts that gave us a chance to have some fun like this were really worth it.  Of course you can always pick an age appropriate toy too.  At one theyre just learning to walk and talk.  They like pull toys or push carts stacking blocks or musical instruments uh... dont pick a loud toy if you love your brothersister  theyre picking up on cause and effect and tend to be every active.  Aim for a toy they can grow with or into.  Most toys have age guidelines right on the box.,Gifts,cuq4krf,2,t5_2qkj0
