86438,0,t3_1uqm33,Personally Im really interested in the idea that if not for the fact that her sister loved and trusted Elsa enough to come after her she would probably have ended up as a tragic villain who was never evil but who nobody understood. And since people like the Duke of Weaseltown would end up convincing everyone she was evil she would have many people trying to kill her and no choice but to attack them to defend herself.,Frozen,ceo9qb1,2,t5_2vpth

227007,0,t1_cf41x25,Not the OP but I think the reason for the windowsill freezing falls mostly in line with the latter reasoning you provide. With her underlying anxiety the thought of going outside would trigger her powers even if she consciously felt excited  going outside would require young Elsa to hide her powers and she holds a lot of insecurities in her heart and mind regarding her capability to do so. As such her powers would react to this latent doubt hidden beneath the excitement.About your core points I really found the base duality between loveunderstanding and fearrespect beautifully and incisively insightful. I think it provides a clearer look at Elsas internal turmoil while also shining a spotlight on Annas influence in this inner struggle. I felt quite excited reading this whole conversation haha...,Frozen,cf49yzo,2,t5_2vpth

Honestly shes a queen I picture her with someone mature noble and regal.I might suggest Elinor from Brave but that might be a little too serene so why not spice it up with an equally empowered and contrastingly fiery extrovert?

477793,0,t1_cfudsu2,Perfectly normal considering its imagination vs real world. Nobodys perfect in real life but in animation they can draft her out as attractive as they want even personalitywise! I doubt anyone will find a girlfriend as perfect as Anna or Elsa but I guess thats subjective.    I hope your obsession fades over time though sounds like its not doing good for you at this stage of your life. Its honestly made me a lot happier listening to the songs and rewatching the film from time to time and keeps me going through stressful times recently. This might be because Im not as immersed as you so try and limit your dose of Frozen or even better  incorporate it into your work listen to the songs while you work!    Good luck buddy hopefully everything works out well for you!,Frozen,cfuktep,11,t5_2vpth
478019,0,t1_cfulhp5,Itll fade you just gotta control it. I know how hard it is not to talk about it to your friends or to not just get lost in it for hours at a time but this can lead to disastrous results. Anything you enjoy is best in small doses hold back on Disney and immerse yourself again in your free time and it will be the best feeling of your life. Also about the ElsaGF problem I had this problem too I liked a few characters so much that I wanted them in my life but you must realize it cant happen Im not trying to break you down or anything but I tried with many things and it just wont work. One last thing what other Disney films have you seen? There are many films that are just as great if you want a similar movie like Frozen I can recommend Tangled.

510833,0,t1_cfyabq3,I dont think everyone really just went with it there were just too few strong personalities left after the staff was reduced.Look closely at the parents reaction during DYWtBaS when year old Elsa says No. Dont touch me. I dont want tohurt you. linkIm not a parent myself but I think I have idea of what they feel. If you follow the idea that a realworld version of Elsa would have depressionanxiety the reaction in DYWtBaS reflects the reaction of parents who dont know what theyre really dealing with.Its pretty clear that having icepowers isnt something everyone has so no one can prepare for it or read about it. Where in todays world you can get a somewhat ok understanding of depression and anxiety just from a simple Google search.So we have the parents who are confused and in pain because they dont know what to do about Elsa. What about the staff?The King and Queen wanted to keep Elsas powers hidden from everyone so they would have told staff to keep out of her room and not question when she wanted to be alone. Still not isolating her completely but when Elsa was in her room it was because she was scared. And when shes scared is when she has the least control over her powers so her room is a nogo for any staff.From the head incident to when Anna gives up trying to build a snowman with Elsa is  years. I imagine the staff would have given up wondering why Elsa kept for herself long before that. When your beloved King says something you dont question it.I also questioned this whole thing the first time I watched it but I feel like it makes sense now. And I hope I explained it well enough for you to understand what Im trying to say And sorry about this wall of text...,Frozen,cfyc1vi,4,t5_2vpth

512173,0,t1_cftdrge,I agree with basically all of this including the similarities between Tangled and Frozen. I was pleasantly surprised by Tangleds quality except the songs sucked whereas I was let down by Frozen yet I enjoyed them about the same.Elsa and Annas lack of backstory is a huge weakness in the film. What were they doing all those years in the castle? What is their relationship like? They seem to be familiar with one another when they interact yet Do You Want To Build A Snowman? implies they barely see one another. It makes the characters opaque weird and hard to understand. Rapunzel was just as isolated in her tower but Tangled did a good job of showing her personality and life in the opening minutes unlike Frozen which gave the impression that Anna and Elsa were essentially in stasis until the day of the coronation.I dont know what the main arc is supposed to be. It would be interesting to learn how the film came to be what it is. If it was originally going to be more based off of The Snow Queen then Elsa would be a bad guy and the story would be about Annas journey to stop her and rescue Kristoff from her clutches. Obviously the film did not end up taking that route. Judging by the Let It Go sequence the story is about Elsas arc but thats hard to support by reference to any other part of the film. She doesnt do anything doesnt interact with any of the other characters very much.I would have liked to see an ElsaKristoff interaction. Did they even talk once? They would have had so much to discuss....,Frozen,cfyhjh0,3,t5_2vpth

535351,0,t1_cg11be6,if we get a sequel i would like for it to focus on Elsa a bit more rather than Anna.  and you know what would be awesome?  if they do something similar to Cinderella  or Shrek  where for some magical reason the past is altered and a bad future occurs.perhaps due to the differences caused Elsa becomes the fullfledged evil that she was originally scripted to become and the whole plot would essentially be about redeeming her so that she can help the main characters set the past in order how it should be.  it could follow a bit more closely on the original plot of the fairy tale since the movie really doesnt have much to do with the original.  but i dont know.  thats just my personal opinion.,Frozen,cg14jt8,3,t5_2vpth

The Lee quote is good enough for me but maybe not for everyone.But as to why the parents didnt explain it after the fact why cant it just be a mistake?  The parents who are effectively Elsas standins on the side of fear in the early scenes simply dont want the girls playing together anymore.  Its sad and ultimately catastrophic but under the circumstances its pretty understandable.  And given that goal they came up with a justification that worked even though it ended up destroying their family.,Frozen,cgcz28v,2,t5_2vpth

656194,0,t3_21niv9,Let us examine the numbers. Some movie franchises do have more subscribers than rfrozen does.However subscribers is a pretty bad way to estimate the size of a community. When we use other methods of estimating the size of rfrozen we get much larger values. Consider the traffic stats for rfrozen which the mods have graciously enabled. This month rfrozen had almost . million page views  thats around the same as a subreddit of  subscribers rWritingPrompts this month had . million page views. It is clear to see that rfrozen has a sizeable active community that are simply not subscribed.The statistics get more interesting when you look at the unique page views. The ratio between unique page views and total page views gives us an indication of how many new people are entering the sub. A high ratio indicates many page views are from new people entering the subreddit whereas a low ratio indicates that most of the page views are from the existing subscribers sheer dedication to the subreddit. rFrozens unique to total pageviews ratio is abnormally low indicating that the bustling activity and content of the subreddit is due to the dedication and time of a few rather than a crowd. So while  Knights of Arendelle may not seem much those are  dedicated knights.,Frozen,cgeuxs1,3,t5_2vpth

The first mention of the conceal dont feel motif is right when her father first gives her the gloves so it stands to reason that they then become her safety blanket. Then the movie reiterates what everyone knows that safety blankets breed dependency and reinforce whatever dread they are used to cover up.

Just when you start to experience a serious tense moment he interrupts with something stupid Of course she knows how to effing knock! Cant you see this is a serious moment of internal conflict?!. I wouldnt have been surprised if he showed up at the ending yelling stupid comments over the blizzard to try to ease the tension of the scene.Sure he has a couple of legitimately funny lines but almost everything he says Im still trying to forget In Summer is annoying.

727433,0,t1_cgmxx4j,Can I step in and comment on this one? Because it was definitely me who moreorless said Bronies have creepers but hey so does Frozen.First off thank you for being open to discussion! I really appreciate it.Anyways my point there was not to condone creepiness or as you put it were creepy youre creepy lets all be creepy! What I was trying to say there was that the main reason I think Frozen fans were avoidingdenying all possible connections to the MLP fandom was because of this idea that all Bronies must be creepy cloppers. What I probably should have added is that while this faction exists it in no way represents the entire or even the majority of Bronies. I then pointed out that to outsiders all Frozen fans must look like absolute creepers because of the Elsanna faction which is again a misrepresentation of the Frozen fandom. As for the usage of the word stigma I consider the word to mean any negative associations surrounding a particular trait or quality usually with the connotation of having preimbibed biases. I understand that for a few people on this subreddit their first introduction to Bronies was unfortunately through cloppers and that certainly leaves a virulent first impression. I cant say that their observations were false but they were certainly from a limited if vocal sample.Like I cant even begin to describe all the good that has come out of the Brony fandom. There are multiple charity drives and donations  that leave me in utter awe of this fandom. You might also have heard in the news over the past month or so about the gradeschool boy who was bullied for bringing an MLP backpack to school and the response from the Brony fandom has been spectacularly supportive I cant help but think that if the men on here were a few years younger and bullied for enjoying Frozen they would probably love to have such a large and supportive community to encourage them.In light this can you see why Im disappointed that all of the multifaceted good points of the Brony fandom are ignored and brushed aside all because we have what frankly every Internet fandom has a Rule  group?,Frozen,cgmyo42,10,t5_2vpth

793690,0,t3_236lv2,I dont know how or why this war started. All I can be certain of is that there was some sort of incident between the Prince of the Southern Isles and the Ice Queen of Arendelle. From what Ive gathered by eavesdropping on the hushed conversations in the taverns and taprooms of neighboring realms the war hasnt gone well for either side. Not like I need to hear them talk. The air is colder than its ever been in spring. People are afraid. They remember the last time the summer froze. I for my part couldnt care less. Im from the North. When it comes to ice and snow Im practically invincible. I may not have any fancy ice magic at my disposal but I dont need it. My sword couldnt care less whether its cold outside. I arrived in Arendelle a week ago. I had planned to pass through unnoticed as I do everywhere else. Not many people are glad to see a man of the North entering their village. We dont exactly make the best company what with our short tempers and generally cold demeanors. However the forces of the Southern Isles cant seem to leave me alone. Three times Ive been attacked by their scouts and once I  came across a band of mercenaries that had sworn its allegiance to the Prince. None of them were especially difficult to dispatch as their tactics arent suited to handling someone with my abilities. I may not have the power to control the elements but Im certainly no pushover in a fight. When I came upon an encampment of the Knights of Arendelle I was wary. They were for the most part young and inexperienced in matters of life and death. In fact many of them seemed more interested in the affairs of the Queen than the task at hand. However their ability to defend themselves was more developed than I first thought and I must say that I was impressed. I joined a caravan to the capitol hoping to find passage out of this place but last night we were set upon by the largest force of Southern Islanders Ive yet seen. As I write these pages the caravan has halted surrounded by the soldiers of the Isles. Thus I must take my leave. I wasnt born in this godsforsaken place but I damn sure dont intend to die in it. Hail to the Queen.,Frozen,cguhvag,3,t5_2vpth

900926,0,t3_24eewz,I hate traveling by boat. The constant rocking of the hull would make me sick for hours. The passage to Arendelle took three days. Three days of rolling wave after wave until we finally docked. I took my first wobbly step onto the dock. The sun was overhead casting down its blinding rays. Seagulls flew by on the ocean winds. All around me people working the sounds of men calling out boats creaking and water lapping at the woodwork. I walked through the town admiring everything. Summer was in full bloom. Birds chirped all around me a rainbow of flowers growing between the cracks in the cobblestone. Everyone dressed in warm colors and light clothing. I must stood out in my thick wool vest and greengray mottled cloak. I walked by the baker as he was pulling fresh rolls out of his oven for the lunch time crowd.. They cost me a half crown but it was the best roll I had ever had. With my belly warm from the roll I headed toward the castle. I had heard stories of a queen with magical powers. I wanted to see for myself. The palace courtyard was brimming with activity.  I removed my cowl and felt the wind blow through my thick wavy hair. The sun was setting against the horizon and candles were being lit all around. The courtyard was filled with people dancing and celebrating. Loud music echoed through the air and the scent of freshly cooked boar roasting sizzled. It was everything I had imagined it was. I sat back watching a group of girls dancing their long hair flowing behind them. One was dressed in a simple red skirt that ended just before her inner thigh. She wore a short sleeved cotton shirt with intricate designs spiraling out. Her hair stopping just before her shoulders. Her friend had a light blue dress that that split down the side of her leg. She had a single braid that wrapped around her shoulder. The girl in red saw me looking and waved. I looked at her then spun around expecting to see someone standing behind me. No one was there I turned back toward her and she smiled at me. I grinned like an idiot and waved back. She whispered something to her friend in blue who giggled. Whats so funny? I thought.I checked my shirt for stains nothing. Do I have something in my teeth? I moved my tongue around my mouth wiping my teeth clean. The girl in red walked over to me and grabbed my hand. Do you want to dance? She askedOh I dont know how to dance. I replied.Ill teach you. She said pulling me into the center of the courtyard. We danced to the fast paced music. My right hand holding her and  my left hand in her we danced. I felt my face grow red as she pressed her body against mine. Whats your name? She asked me.Uh Daktoa. I said.Annabel. she said.The song ended and the band began a slower softer song. We slowed our pace till we were swaying in the soft glow of the candles and night sky. She rested her head on my shoulder I could feel her heart beat through her chest into mine. Her hair smelled of lilys. The air a warm summers eve with the wind slightly blowing around us. As we danced I felt her warm embrace. our hands together our hearts beating as one. Everything was perfect.When the song ended we stood holding each other. Her friend in blue came over and told her they had to get home. She followed her friend but turned back to look at me. I ran after her. I grabbed her hand just before she left the gates.Annabel I... I said. She looked at me her eyes a piercing blue in the night her face glowing in the candle light. A single hair in front of her face. I held her in my arms. I took my hand and slowly brushed her hair away. I closed my eyes leaned in and kissed her. My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. We stood in an embrace for what felt like an eternity. Finally we pulled back she was smiling her eyes fluttering. We looked into each others eyes sighing. Ill see you around. I said grinning sheepishly.She bit her lip and smiled Id like that.With that she walked away she kept glancing back at me still smiling. I put my hands behind my head and walked into town whistling a tuneless song. The scent of lilys hanging around me. I had completely forgotten about the queen all I could think about was Annabel and I couldnt have been happier. ...This is what I would do in one day. Sorry for the length. TLDR I came to Arendelle spent an evening at a party and met a beautiful woman named Annabel.,Frozen,ch6ouxw,2,t5_2vpth

She was the only one there to see it.Sorry I thought you meant during the FTFTIF Reprise when she actually said to Anna Yes Im alone but Im alone and free.  I think that was her trying to convince Anna that she would be okay so she wouldnt feel bad about leaving her alone.As for Let it Go I think she certainly felt a sense of freedom in being able to be herself without fear of hurting anyone but I also think there was some self deception involved.  I think she was kind of lying to herself in a way telling herself that she was happy because in her mind the thing she really wanted most a relationship with her sister just wasnt an option.,Frozen,cha83oo,1,t5_2vpth

1000832,0,t1_chi1w6w,ampampamp Joik sfw gtA joik also spelled yoik luohti vuolle leudd or juoiggus is a traditional Sami form of song Originally joik referred to only one of several Sami singing styles but in English the word is often used to refer to all types of traditional Sami singing. According to music researchers joik is one of the longest living music traditions in Europe and is the folk music of the Sami people.  Its sound is comparable to the traditional chanting of some Native American cultures.  With the Christianization of the Sami joiking was condemned as sinful. The Norwegian assimilation policy and the church and ecclesiastical movements views on joiking as sin have played important roles in the devaluation. In the s it was forbidden to use joiking in school in Sami areas and one of the reasons that joiking was controversial may be its association with noaidi and preChristian mythology rituals. Meanwhile joiking was strongly rooted in culture and tradition was maintained. Today joiking is still alive and is also used as a source of inspiration and an element in contemporary Sami music.gtInteresting Sami people | nde Somby | Ulla Pirttijrvi | Sami music Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchiwcq oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechiwcq.

1151853,0,t1_chz71ll,Oh my gosh who would even?,Frozen,chz74sr,2,t5_2vpth
1151995,0,t1_chz61xe,Okay Im about to go all philosophy . You use the word wrong to describe incest thereby implying that incest is either wrong morally or against nature. If you mean the latter then you would indeed be correct. Humans are not biologically meant to be in incestuous relationships because of the potential to harm offspring this of course doesnt apply to Elsa and Anna but if you are looking for a good discussion on homosexuality and nature I suggest you go here Additionally even the potential for bith defects cannot necessarily qualify incest as wrong because all sexual reproduction has this potential.If you mean morally wrong then we need to look at the situation from the perspective of ethics and discard any analysis that relies on tradition or what society deems to be morally right. Ill examine it from both a deontological perspective as well as from a consequentialist one. From a Kantian perspective the outcome of an action can not be used to determine whether it is morally good or not this can only come from the will behind the action. Therefore whatever positive or negative consequences that result from an incestuous relationship cannot be taken into consideration. If the intent of both parties is to love one another completely and not to use the other as a means to and end then this must be morally good regardless of the two parties relationship to one another or the consequences. The consequentialist perspective Ill look at Utilitarianism holds that the proper course of action is the one which results in the most good. It would be difficult to analyze all incestuous relationships from this perspective because one would need to look at all possible cases so Ill stick to the one in question. It is really quite simple a hypothetical gay incestuous relationship can only be analyzed insofar as it affects the two parties and how it affects those around them. If the two are genuinely in love then of course it is morally good. Furthermore there is no chance for disabled offspring. If those around them are aware of the relationship and are supportive and loving then of course it is good as well. If the relationship brings about unforseen consequences being disowned causing depression in others suicide etc... then it becomes more complicated. Therefore I cannot deduce whether it is morally right using this analysis but I can say that the only way to call it morally wrong is in how the relationship affects others but this can apply equally to any relationship not just an incestuous one. Sorry for the wall of text. I partially wrote this because I wanted to see what I remembered from philosophy .,Frozen,chz7piq,5,t5_2vpth

1423257,0,t1_ciuevxh,gt The main point of Frozen the thing that the entire movie leads up to is the fact that love between sisters is just as powerful and full of magic as that between lovers. By making them lovers you take away the main idea that made Frozen unique and slide the film in with the rest of Disneys long line history of Princess films. This is only true if the romance is in full swing before the sacrifice. Considering they barely even talked to eachother up until that point that clearly isnt the case. Any seriously romantic relationship between them would have to be after Annas sacrifice and not before  and therefore not negating the movies unique points about sisterly love and selfsacrifice.Im not the only person who has a decent argument against missing the point of the film.,Frozen,ciuole8,1,t5_2vpth

This pillar of the community was leaving? Simply unthinkable! Nonetheless the crowd parted giving him a path to the gates. As he walked people said things to him. Things of thanks of fond memories. Some only having a faint idea of his importance just stood quietly aside. Others refusing to believe what had just taken place begged him to stay. uWWWWWWGMWWWWWWW started to weep. As uHalJordanGotSweg progressed through the crowd one sentiment soon became clear good luck and we understand.Sorry about that. Consider it a memorialisation of this post.

1495734,0,t3_2bbv4v,Giving Hans leadership was a dumb move on Anna. Seriously you are giving a person youve only known for a couple of hours control of an entire kingdom. Did she learn nothing in her classes? Does she have any common sense for that matter? On to your question lots of things would change. Hans wouldnt be able to lead an his small army to capture Elsa but he couldve also use Dukes men or some of his own. Hes a smart guy and Im assuming would have lots of back up plans. Either way if he was able to capture Elsa he wouldnt be able to order her execution so his little accident would probably needed to be staged for another time. Assuming the sequence of events in the film stayed the same Anna would probably either die of her frozen heart or kissed Kristoff Hans who wouldve still pretended to be her true love not really sure how the magic work if both persons have to reciprocate it truly or anything. However once Elsa known that Anna was freezing they might share a true love moment and shell thaw. Its much less climatic without Hans thats what Ive noticed.,Frozen,cj3rjz8,2,t5_2vpth

1666043,0,t1_cjojhcu,The difference that Im seeing is that none of those deliberately copied the artistic design to the extent that this one did.  The actual content of mockbusters usually isnt problematic.  Theyre either different enough that they have the same general idea but not the same execution of that idea theyre completely different ex. Transmorphers is closer to a combination of Terminator and The War of the Worlds than it is to Transformers or they draw on a public domain source.  The issue here is with the title design which is both complex and nearly identical.With something like Tangled Ups design its dangerously similar but still different enough that you could honestly say that a lawsuit targeting it might catch an innocent producers film in the same net even though this one is probably intended to trick people into buying it the real similarities are in having the same color gradient and in including a flourish on the g which in this case is distinct and wouldnt even look similar without the identical color gradient.  The producers could lose a lawsuit but it seems to me more likely that Disney would end up having to pay court fees and would come out looking like the bad guy.  With the Frozen Land logo the change has been to a virtually identical backdrop and the unique font element for Frozen is...er slightly elongated?Real mockbusters are generally dishonest and terrible but this just looks like Phase  has a marketing department thats either lazy incompetent or utterly broke.,Frozen,cjp606l,2,t5_2vpth

1703109,0,t1_cjtsnto,okay I relistened and here are some of the most obvious spots I reacted to a bit too long of a wait until striking chords with left hand       You have to remember there is a pace whether you like it or not. You set the pace of the piece with your right hand and if the left suddenly doesnt sync up to that there is a mismatch. Keep in mind its most often totally fine to drag out hitting the notes with your right hand especially since there are many soft tender moments in this piece which you also do nicely  but leftie needs to dance along!Also theres that part at  where you do the opposite and basically cut out one full bar. Woulda been really sweet if youd held your horses and not rushed away there All this is very nitpicky but you asked for it so P,Frozen,cjtu7vk,2,t5_2vpth

Next episode its a two hour one which means its important but it does count as  episodes itself therefore we will actually watch episodes  and  of the season. A two hour special which ends on the th episode? yeah perhaps the participation of Frozen will end there.Elsa has appeared well even though she hasnt done much most of the episodes on  and   will be the  ones promised Anna has been in  episodes  or  if you count Lails apparition as a trap set by the SQ plus  she could appear on  and Kristoff has been on  potentially appearing in . Seems numbers work. Maybe we can begin to get ready to watch the Frozen arc end. If this happens Im guessing Elsa will go back with Anna and the SQ will be left in SB with Elsa gone shell go even crazier and will want revenge for separating Elsa and her. Becoming a full blown villain and  finally defeated on the next  episodes in which theyll also use Rumple for a tiein into the next halfs problem. ,Frozen,clz5pip,1,t5_2vpth

2483419,0,t1_cmipfsx,I think Elsa wanted to have her sister back and to be able to have normal social interactions but she saw this as an impossible option because it would endanger everyone around her and shes too selfless to put others at risk for her own happiness. Getting away gave her a freedom she hadnt experienced in a very long time and it was thrilling but deep down she didnt want to be alone she just felt she had no other choice. LIG could even be thought of as a continuation of what Elsa had been doing her entire life. Shes still locking herself away from everyone due to fear shes just giving herself a bigger prison. In this sense LIG was actually a song of her surrender. Elsa is surrendering to her fears believing that she can never overcome them. Shes giving up hope and that to me is the underlying tragedy of that song. Shes letting go of the hope that she can ever be happy.,Frozen,cmipz2m,4,t5_2vpth

2686366,0,t1_cn8wqbb,Well I love Alan Menkens songs. He doesnt just write love songs for example in Hercules he wrote all those Gospel music which is amazing. Plus he composed the Kingdom Dance song in Tangled which is very medieval Celtic. I also loved the very dark and powerful theme in The Hunchback of Notre Dame especially Claude Frollos song where he sings about his lust for Esmeralda.I am a bigger Disney fan than a Frozen fan and I am hugely in love with all the songs. You can tell how much music has changed over the  years of Disney. When Walt was still alive the music was very classic and preWW eraish. Then when the Disney Renaissance sparked the songs started to get more modern.,Frozen,cn987sq,1,t5_2vpth

2827888,0,t1_cnpi7uj,I understand what you mean. But I feel youre equalizing Fanartfiction to shipping which is not the same thing. Shippers can ship without producing anything. And by this I meanthey are just doing random post about their chars and getting annoyed when the story progresses other way. Trying  to convince everyone why their ship is perfect on the canon even if the characters used are not gaybi or have more personality than what they refer. These shippers every time they post they do it about the love part of the story even if the subject is different. They change the motivation of the chars and get mad when the evolution of the chars doesnt let them be just cute guys in a relationship anymore. And that has nothing to do with the producing part of the shipping. Worse offenders of this are when a ship becomes so popular because of them that producers actually introduce those couples or a very similar one just to cash in thus affecting the story for a petty preference in many cases.Those are the ones that produce the hate.Moving to the producing part of FFFanart  I understand that the artist are adapting parts of the work of fiction without focusing on every canonic detail. But this is also one of the reasons I dont read FF and please take no offense if you are a FF writerreader. FF often just takes caskets and molds of the chars in order to create a very different story be it based on things that were not important on the original work on the first place or exaggerating parts for convenience. Be it romantic gore drama etc...the stories might be great but is just riding over already created chars morphing their settings for a totally different result that people often feel attracted to only because the chars there have the same names physique and sometimes the abilities of another already established and beloved char.Fan art I find different and perhaps seems hypocritical but I just see it as productions of stuff one would like to see not the creation of another story using borrowed chars.Personally I have nothing against FF writers or readers or shipping. I myself may ship sometimes even tough I dont usually become obsessed with it. The FF department is just something that doesnt take my attention because is not the intentionality of the original author for how heshe wants their creations to be perceived and the great stories would be even greater if the chars were original themselves.And as far as Ive noticed many antishippers will ignore fanwork of the shippers without making much fuzz about it its only when shipping starts to take over everything that it becomes a problem. Believe me rfrozen is really tame in the hate to ships department there are much more heavy fandoms on that scenario out there P.,Frozen,cnpiy28,3,t5_2vpth

2992874,0,t1_co7kj42,Sorry for the very late reply. I was going to answer during my break time but I was flooded with a torrent of comments just because I didnt recognize some Disney characters lol. I had to reply to them all to clarify my point .I like to think of civilizations as a pyramid graph. At the base you have races comparable to our prehistoric era and they make the bulk of civilizations out there. On the top is the smallest point and that is where the spacefaring races are. We would be at around the middle of this graph.I was thinking about scenarios this whole day at work lol especially the Pleadians vs Warhammer. Yeah they could likely deal with pretty much everything with ease though the Chaos Gods are sort of an out of context problem and I cant really see any way they could possibly hurt them.Nah no worries lol. I dont follow any religion at all but their stories do interest me. I always feel like the ancients were actually on to something to be honest. I feel like they misinterpreted some sort of higher intelligence and mistook them for gods. Yeah I personally believe in the ancient aliens theory but its my own version though. Not the one that is always thrown around in popular media.Yeah these guys sound really strong. The Xeelee so far sound like the perfect match IMO but as I said they span the entire universe and use entire galaxies as construction materials. The Xeelee could pretty much solo most races out there with no effort at all. Hell as an example lets put Star Wars Star Trek Mass Effect Halo Warhammer Frozen and my verse ALL in one team. Xeelee still win with likely no casualties haha. I aware of the old true Illuminati. The one in modern culture is IMO just plain retarded and seems like nothing but silly nonsense to me.I plan to upgrade the computer over time though. As for being caught. The problem is that I dont have my own room and the computer is literally right next to my brothers . Well I will still be able to come here during my no work days since my brother leaves to work during those days lol.I am such an overthinker that the most obvious answer always flies over my head haha.

But between a film that would do Okay or good and a future franchise that could do way better Disney would pick up the later. Disney will either play Frozen  while its still fresh or kind of leave it aside. But as others have mentioned there are ways to keep the Frozen brand alive along the years that pretty much depends on Disney and how they decide to manage it.

I like to use Korrasami as an example of how such messages can be widely accepted. The audience might be significantly smaller but it would certainly be very vocal and provide massive praise.Of course in the scope of Frozen and the way they did it the movie pretty much had the strongest message it could by sticking with familial love.

3475476,0,t1_cpo87xk,gt When I think monster I think malice is part of that. She might be dangerous when shes not in control but monster is a completely different accusation.Yeah but its a normal reaction to feel and reject the unknown and to be fair if one saw a random dude suddenly start throwing fire and endangering people sympathy for him is not the first thing that will come into ones mind.gtThose dont make sense as being in the same universe or for Belle to be in that area for example it makes sense for Rapunzel and Eugene to be in the same universe as Anna and Elsa for them to attend Elsas coronation for Corona to exist in the same universe as Arendelle.Not necessarily seems magic is pretty taboo in the Frozen world yet Rapunzels magic was well received and certainly known its just clashing. But again if a company puts easter eggs all the time then its most likely just random references than not.gtIf you were trying to put these movies in real world times and places maybe but they exist in a fictional time period in a fictional universe. The author also conveniently ignored the fact that Disney movies are full of historical anachronisms.gtYou could put Frozen in several different time periods based on things in the movie all the way up to  or later if you go by Elsas use of the word fractals in Let it Go but actually its in the s or more specifically its based on the s of our world but again it exists in a fictional universe in a time period that never really was.Oh no I totally agree they are a complete different universe with different historical facts taht have lots of anachronisms. But the way she put it is really simple the author proved how fashion was widespread and why it would be like that in Europea continent and why would fashion evolve like that. Yet when you see Flynn and Rapunzel on Frozen they are completely clashing  with the rest of the style every other char is dressed on a certain style with some minor differences. Tangled chars just dont fit they seem outdated.In any case I guess its no use to discuss you need hardproof they arent there I need hardproof they are. We simply in totally different spectrums  but at the end of the day Im sure it wont be touched anyway so we cant really do anything about it.Funny I was thinking of putting on my flair Easter Eggs arent canon so if I do pls dont take it as if its directed to you x.gtIf the Frozen books Im talking about the Anna and Elsa books btw and the upcoming A Frozen Heart started contradicting canon from the movies and short films that would be different but so far the books are set in the  year gap between Frozen and Frozen Fever and I dont see Frozen  directly contradicting what happened in them.gtI wasnt talking about golden books and things like that I was talking about longer stories like the Anna and Elsa books. As for the wolf we dont know when that comic was set do we? It could be well after Frozen Fever even after Frozen . For that matter the wolf wouldnt necessarily have been onscreen during a  minute short wouldnt even necessarily have been anywhere near the party.Fair enough  the comics also show Olaf surviving without his flurry for example. All this material wont contradict anything in the future because it has little lasting substance P. They are random adventures for the characters.  However as much as I want Elsa to have a wolf pet I dont see anything of this taken seriously more like just more material of a Franchise but doesnt necessarily follow the main story because of the reach of it. The difference might be the Book about Anna and Hans.gtThe whole Hans plot was garbage. If they were going to have him in there they could have put more thought into it just tried something different. It would have been cliche but Hans with fire powers could have been better. What the hell its expensive fanfiction anyway. I was expecting like the best of fanfiction brought to life not necessarily something worthy of the canon.gtWhen you say the resolution was terrible you were talking about the wishing star right? That was pretty bad but Anna and Elsas reunion kind of made up for it for me. Like I said my expectations were set pretty low. All I wanted was some decent live action fanfiction and I got that.gtThe Frozen cast was really good. I know Im not the first person to say this but Elizabeth Lail in particular was just amazing as Anna. Georgina Haig was a great Elsa. There were some weak moments with her but I mostly blame the writing for that. Scott Michael Foster took a couple episodes to grow on me but he made a good Kristoff. I even thought Tyler Jacob Moore made a good Hans even though if they were going to bring him into the story they could have done way better.The actor for Hans was great even if his plot was utter garbage. However the thing is OUAT is its own thing and they assimilated Frozen into it great but that doesnt mean they just throw random bad quality stuff in there because they are showing part of another brand. OUAT needed to be good because of itself as a show not to showcase something appealing to the Frozen masses. And it failed in many ways just to shove more Frozen in.As for the resolution yeah I disliked that a lot but also how Ingrid was defeated. It was just anticlimatic and bordering nonsensical. It was really dull the only good thing about that episode was the comedy. IMO the best parts were Elsa rescuing Emma and Anna defeating Rumple.gtI havent liked the ReginaSnow back story for a while. Weve seen all of that we need to see and it just isnt working for me anymore.Same I got bored of it Back in S I cant stand people who still want more because they are the original characters well dammit I watched the show because it was a fairy tale ensemble not because it was a Snowfest.gtYou could see the urn in the background or something.gtOn a somewhat related note I wonder if the little girl being named Ingrid in the first Anna and Elsa book was meant as a reference to OUaT. Probably not.Most likely a coincidence its not an uncommon name to associate to northern parts after all. I would hope to see Anna watch a flaming dagger and say something like Uhh wavy knife or something similar P.,Frozen,cpofhhs,1,t5_2vpth
3476245,0,t1_cpoi0pi,gt Because they already saw it was harmless and beautiful before that everyone was baffled. And Mother Gothel knew about it P Rapunzel probably got famous after the whole deal specially when Flynn Rider became her husband.Right she got famous after the whole deal because shes the freaking lost princess of Corona. Pgt Once again she explained why it wasit would be like that. Its more a matter of logiclogistics than just differences between worlds.Its still a fictional world and while the creators were going for a general aesthetic based on a real world time period theyre not bound to real world logistics.  A fictional world is whatever the creators want it to be.gt To not make the scene look weird by putting a PeasantHunter looking guy entering the castle. Remember that everyone was using their best clothes and not everyone on the audience knows tangled. Also just as the other easter eggs it made it less obvious and something to look for.I see your point but for the second they were on screen I hardly think it would have mattered if they looked a little out of place.  They specifically made them look like they fit there and they kept their outfits consistent with the continuity by making Eugene a prince.Contrast that with Hans cameos in Big Hero .  Hes wearing the same outfit he wore in Frozen which in Sanfransokyo of the future is way outdated.  They didnt try to make him look like he belonged in that world but they did make Rapunzel and Eugene look like they belonged in the world of Frozen.gt Thats true however what I mean is it was obvious how some parts were forced to make it more Frozenlike and keeping everyone content with just the Frozen chars apparition instead of writing something better to begin with.Yeah I get what you mean.  Some parts were really forced.gt Yeah It goes well with her personality after all. Or they could also have Elsa standing still before random danger and being useless but I doubt thats really a good referenceYeah I really hope they dont ruin Elsa like that in Frozen . ,Frozen,cpoimzr,1,t5_2vpth

It isnt the details like freckles or eye color because the artwork is too generic for that.  So that leaves her hair.  Thick blonde braid tossed casually over the left shoulder is a certain signifier that the Elsa is definitely Elsa from Frozen. OK.  So that doesnt check out.  Her hair is braided.  That is it.

3838109,0,t1_cqto07j,I agree with you in that what matters is their own interpretation and that what others do realistically shouldnt hinder their capacity to take the story on the direction they desire to or think its the best for the world they have created. I believe original authors have all the rights to make the story what they want it to be. Im not sure thats the reason why Jen chooses to not follow fan ideas but I support them on that sadly fan ideas are nothing but noise on the creative process and one must truly do their own vision and desire on a story rather than pander or get mixed up with what people wants which is the absolute worst one can do. So of course Id support them if they truly wanna  follow  a determined path specially if I like the result regardless of OUAT or whatever.That being said theres a big difference between OUAT and fanfiction itself. OUAT is a known broadcasted TV Series  and while you can say Jen amp Chris dont know fan fiction they most certainly know OUAT. To the general public it would definitely come off as lazy writing to just use the same OUAT elements on the sequel for something as famous as Frozen people will dig scenes of the series immediately. But aside from the public critics themselves wouldnt be so happy to see the movie repeating stuff. And well the Frozen team couldnt really complain since they reviewed and approved OUAT to follow that storyline.That last one makes me thing that they decided to let them show it because its an idea they really arent interested in developing in Frozen therefore creating no conflict once theyd created the unavoidable sequel. Personally I hope they do other stuff well they might create a problematic like that but with other elements for the sheer fact that we already saw that in OUAT so seeing more different stuff would actually be a win for the fandom IMO. Of course well see what happens in the end we should just hope for the best possible for Frozen regardless of the polemic of the idea .,Frozen,cqts01u,2,t5_2vpth

He also tried to overpower and subdue her but he chose not to let her die.Right he tried to save her life by dropping a chandelier on her head.  There was no reason for him to assume that wouldnt kill her.  If he had wanted to save her life he could have redirected the bolt literally anywhere else in the room.Thats what this whole thing comes down to isnt it?  You think Hans wanted to save Elsa.  You think hes not that bad of a guy deep down and that he really was just trying to save Arendelle from destruction.gt The audience sees this yes. The soldiers in the film do not. Theyre busy fighting Marshmallow.You dont know if they saw that.  Even if they didnt its easy enough to put together.gt Its really not. They just came to inquire after the princess and the Queen had her ice monster attack them her own men with no warning and no chance to resolve it peacefully. The Queens monster almost killed her future brotherinlaw. Its very easy for them to believe shes out for blood.Right if theyre morons.  She didnt pursue them they came to her palace and the only guards she was attacking came in after her.  As for Marshmallow he was guarding the castle.  Those two guards broke into her home and she defended herself she didnt go to Arendelle and attack them.gt Are you trying to say people would somehow blame Hans for Elsa having magical powers and freezing her kingdom?

4300266,0,t3_3a8ptk,Personally I would like less songs I was really happy that the film didnt have more songs after fixer upper specially one that would ruin the crude moments. I loved how it was wrapped up.  I know however the film might have the same amount or more songs due the popularity of the Frozen soundtrack.Anyway Id like a sisterly song of course but hopefully it isnt full of them. It would need to be a fun one.Id like solo songs for both Elsa and Anna powerful as let it go dealing with their problems. A Kristanna song is almost a given they didnt have one as every other disney couple it would be nice  nonetheless. Id like to hear more of Kristoff to be honest that voice is great!.Elsa having songs with whoever and more would be great She only had small parts and let it go well only Let it go so she needs more now.I also hope songs arent as expositive as MTAPD or DYWBAS  hope they arent awkward but more sentimental and fitting in context and outside context  that make you feel the characters of course were bound to have silly songs but hopefully they keep it like Frozen with the songs actually making sense at most moments rather than just happening like in other Disney films.,Frozen,csad4hg,3,t5_2vpth

4395510,0,t1_csksxj6,gt Sure though Id imagine the fear would be less without that memory of hurting Anna with her magic or with the knowledge the accident was just that and that she is in control of her powers. She didnt really lose control the first time she struck Anna she just panicked and missed when she was trying to catch her.The fear would be more of a thing of No one can know because the world wouldnt accept that I am a monster thingy.gtI dont think anything like the Coronation incident would have happened if she learned to control her powers as they grew with her if she didnt live in fear of herself for  years. She would have learned to love and accept that part of herself her magic long ago and she would have control. I dont think it would have been a problem whether she chose to keep her powers secret from her people or not.People like the Duke would still find her unholy and whatnot. And fear might still be a trigger for her if she doesnt know that her love specifically can help with that given people would fear her and act against her she might still cause some trouble.gtI dont know where you got that impression......or that one. Yeah I didnt word that well I dont say that love doesnt work but the realizationimpact  was important. She loved her parents and Anna all the way she received love from her parents explicitly. But accepting herself and  her place in the world might be harder if her parents tell her to keep that hidden from people. We also have seen that even when she was just happy the window froze so her magic might have been kind of wilder as a child even when she wasnt exactly feeling bad stuff.  I think thats the reason why granpabbie didnt just say as long as you love your family that love will keep your powers in control Elsa needed to actually have a big experience on her lfie to be sure and not take things for granted her magic was ought to be tamed rather than raised.The troll did say that her magic was gonna get worse over time and I think that was just a natural part of her growing up and being a teenager and all that which is why I believe the movie was set when she was finally  to show that as a complete woman she could go into the stage of perfect control.Also Snowgies. Involuntary stuff still might be problematic.In any case I think OUAT did a pretty good interpretation of this scenario with Ingrids story.gtAs I said before I think had she not spent  years fearing her magic she would have stayed in control of it. I dont think there would have been significant accidents like her temporary eternal winter. Im sure snowgies would still happen when she gets sick theres no reason to think they wouldnt but thats not eternal winter level disastrous at all.Yeah sure but growing up like that instead of a sudden revelation with all the feels of the eternal Frozen might be worse if everyone knows. She could be treated bad as a child  treated with misstrust and fear for the mere reason she has those powers. She could freeze some windows or create snowgies and problems like that minor but enough for people to hate her or bully her like in the songs actually so while everyone loved Anna she would feel left out and eventually go dark. After all Hans and the Duke  foreigners were there to suck up all the hatred due their actions Elsa herself is better at her powers and can do more good with them than when she was a child with less ideas and trust.So yeah I think evil Elsa would still happen there.gtAnother thing to consider here is why Hans decided to pursue Anna in the first place cause his original plan was to marry Elsa at least that was his plan three years before the coronation. He pursued Anna because he thought it would be easier because she was desperate for love because Elsa had shut her out and she didnt know why. If things were different she wouldnt have been so desperate for love maybe she wouldnt have fallen for him at all. Even if she did I think she would listen when Elsa told her something was off about him and I think she would have figured that out just maybe not as quickly if he didnt rush the proposal cause I think thats a big part of why Elsa thought something was off about him.If Elsa was still hard enough to approach that he wouldnt even try therefore not directly ruining his chances with Anna too then perhaps he would still go for Anna  just slower. The fact that Anna had Elsa doesnt mean she wouldnt wish for love  shed still be Anna after she just wouldnt be so rushed but could fall for Hans even if with she wouldnt marry him the first day.,Frozen,csl3yad,1,t5_2vpth

Knowing about the structure and behavior of the constituent particles opens up a lot of doors in the realm of particle physics. Like I said I geek over this shit gtgt.Lol at least you got to see it. And I see at least its good to know that others here besides us still remember Tfw.,Frozen,ct4v556,1,t5_2vpth

4782180,0,t1_ctwp83n,gt Hahaha I see you point. But Uhmm we were not exactly confirmed that no one knew P. Ok no one did but maybe they are from a secret Islandcontinent? haha.gt If that doesnt convince maybe other creatures not as showy as dragons?Nah dragons are good as long as theres a reasonable explanation for why they werent mentioned until then.gt Mmm IDK is Anna really the outsmarting type?I think she could be yes.gt I do think Anna has to do something of course but I was thinking the whole outsmarting game to be something more of a team effort seeing the plan of the villain unfold. As for Anna well Elsa could fight and Anna and Kristoff could infiltrate the enemies base and steal something or stop or break something.I kind of see Anna helping against Elsas wishes or without her knowledge at least at first.  If were talking about a villain who is powerful enough to be an actual threat to Elsa I could see a scenario where Anna wants to help and Elsa just wants her to stay safe cause of course if this villain is powerful enough to go up against Elsa what chance is someone without magic like Anna going to have?Ultimately they would have to work together with Anna outsmarting the villain in some way using her own strengths that have nothing to do with magic to their advantage maybe even saving Elsa at a crucial moment.  Maybe as you said she infiltrates the villains lair and breaks or steals or stops something while Elsa is fighting the villain.gt Yeah I know that however the thing is fear is still demonized in Frozen but it shouldnt be.gt Fear is a normal human experience is not bad is something we feel and actually helps us as long as it doesnt truly get us. Elsa finally dominating her powers even while fearing beyond just love and learning to feel fear without seeing it as the big enemy and her weakness in life is the next path of evolution for the character IMO.Elsas problem wasnt fear in and of itself it was fear of herself fear of her magic.,Frozen,ctxc1bg,1,t5_2vpth

5850187,0,t3_3vd7p2,this has been discussed several time i think in this sub.Edit Officially Anna is the hero. But since Elsa is the favorite they tend to twist the movie into Elsa being the hero.  I subscribe to the Anna Hero POVEdit Some however believe that Hans was the hero. Which in someway i could see that,Frozen,cxmhkrl,5,t5_2vpth
5860557,0,t3_3vhpao,gtWhat Elsa do?Shed be really disappointed with her sister and Im sure shed let her know how disappointed she was.  But in the end I think shed let Anna make her own decision however wrong it might be.gtWhat would Anna do if she realizes that Elsa saw her?Shed be extremely embarrassed and would either try to justify her actions or apologize profusely for her mistake.  Getting caught by Elsa would probably be even worse for Anna than if Kristoff had caught her.gtWhat would Kristoff do if he find Anna there?Hed probably be completely shocked since this would be completely out of character for Anna.  Im guessing he would turn and leave without saying a word.  Kristoff already had very little faith in humanity and this might make him turn very bitter toward everyone.gtWhat would happen on the end?Maybe this is how Kristelsa becomes canon.gtWhat would happen if the guy was Hans!?The universe implodes.gtWhat would you think of this happening on Frozen ?I wouldnt like it at all.  Its nice to believe that there are some people who are completely trustworthy and for me that is Anna.  Something like this would completely ruin her character for me.gtHow do you think the general audience would react to this?It would probably depend on the final outcome.  I mean it would definitely make Frozen  very realistic which might broaden its appeal but it could have a very negative effect on the publics view of Annas character.,Frozen,cxnuk0v,3,t5_2vpth

7800702,0,t1_d3m2voa,Yes it indeed proves that legit  Sami people in the s indeed looked white which means that Kristoff is perfectly okay as an accurate representation of the Sami. The Norwegianization referred more to cultural things like erasing the old religion and getting them to speak Norwegian and slowly trying to erase the Sami languages but it didnt force them all to interbreed with whites so that the ethnicity would change holy shit. ,Frozen,d3suyle,2,t5_2vpth

9778732,0,t1_dahqfym,During the past few years a number of movies have started off really well Inside Out Minions Zootopia Finding Dory but none of them had the staying power of Frozen.  I was really worried when Minions started to get close to Frozens worldwide gross.  I still cant believe that it got all the way to  all time.I hope Moana does well too but I just like the idea of Frozen holding onto the record as the highest grossing animated movie  especially with all of the Frozen haters hoping that it will be beaten every single time a new movie is released.,Frozen,daifztz,1,t5_2vpth

11117041,0,t3_5yl23z,Let me start off by saying that in my opinion the cons are extremely insignificant when compared to the pros but anyway here goesPROS Elsa  The absolute best character ever created by Disney Anna  The second best character ever created by Disney The songs  Easily the best since the Disney renaissance The story  Very unique when compared to typical good vs evil movies  Familial love instead of romantic love  You cant marry a man you just met The double plot twist  Act of true love doesnt come from Hans because hes actually the bad guy  Act of true love doesnt come from Kristoff either  It comes from Anna herselfCONS The pacing  The first  of the movie has all of the really good songs and is basically perfect  The middle  seems weak in comparison  The final  is great except for the lack of any great songs Not enough Elsa or enough interaction between Anna and Elsa  I think the scenes that show Anna and Elsa interacting with each other are the absolute best part of Frozen so it would have been nice to see more of thatI personally think Frozen is a victim of its own success.  Many people hate on it just because its so popular even though theyll never admit it or even realize it.  The initial reviews of Frozen were almost all completely positive.  It got an A from Cinemascore which is based on initial audience reaction on opening day i.e. before anyones been influenced by Internet trolls.  In my opinion Frozen isnt perfect but its pretty damn close.,Frozen,des3vow,3,t5_2vpth
11330171,0,t3_61pe3j,gt The song is inspired by indigenous Saami and Scandinavian culture and was written and composed by Norwegian composer Frode Fjellheim. The song is a combination of Saami yoiking and the Danish Christian hymn Dejlig er jordenFairest Lord Jesus composed by Frode Fjellheim. The original hymn is composed by the Danish composer B.S.

11744600,0,t3_676n31,Havent heard this theory before its kind of cool. Personally I believe Elsa has semireality warping powers. Allow me to explain...She can freeze stuff summon ice winter storms etc. The quantity she is able to summon relative to the time it takes her to actually do it makes me think that she isnt just freezing the water in the air. There just isnt enough of it in the surrounding area for a storm as big as we saw in the climax. So she must actually be willing the ice and snow into existence. I can demonstrate this.When she creates Olaf during Let It Go its easy enough to see where the snow came from the mountain is covered in it. But... notice that Olaf is formed with coal buttons on his body. Where did the coal come from? Coal is usually found at  meters under the Earth or lower. And Elsa is currently on top of a mountain. And coal isnt water ice or snow or anything that logically falls under the command of ice magic. So either Elsas power is great enough to rip coal from hundreds of feet beneath the Earth at the drop of a hat also implying she can control things that arent necessarily made of water or the fact that she was building a snowman and snowmen have coal buttons caused coal buttons to appear because thats what she wanted. She literally willed the coal into existence. Reality warping. If a very minor example.Also ever try to run on ice? Or keep any sort of traction on it at all without special gear on your feet? Elsa was able to run up an ice staircase in heels. To me this says that Elsa has the power to control friction itself and she can do so passively without thinking about it. In theory this means she could have the ability to stick to walls like Spiderman given said wall had a little frost on it.And dont even get me started on making ice with the consistency of cloth manipulating the color of ice cloth and normal cloth alike lifting objects in the air with seeming pseudotelekinesis making snow come to life which combined with her excellent sculpturing skills and control over colors could potentially give her the power to make lifelike ice clones indistinguishable from the real thing.DEEP BREATH But I must sleep now. Those things are for another post. P,Frozen,dgra3ip,1,t5_2vpth
11772842,0,t1_dgtyubw,I love Elsa mainly because of her character and who she really is.  Thats one of the reasons I like her coronation look best.  It doesnt bother me when people also notice her outward beauty except when thats all they notice.  I think Elsas extremely attractive but I dont think that by acknowledging her physical beauty it automatically supersedes Elsas true beauty which lies within her.The reason Elsa became a worldwide phenomenon has much more to do with her personality and relatability than her appearance or even her ice powers.  Unfortunately many people completely overlook that.,Frozen,dguhgrc,1,t5_2vpth
