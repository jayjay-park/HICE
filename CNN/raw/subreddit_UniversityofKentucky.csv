707093,0,t3_2271pv,I live in the Chevy Chase  Ashland area about a mile and a half east of campus. The prices for rent are higher here but its more of a residents and grad studentprofessional student crowd here than closer to campus. Plus you can do away with the  for a parking pass and just walk or ride a bike. I love the area because of all the great shops bars and restaurants I can walk to.As a grad student you may enjoy some of the local breweries rather than the college bars. Country Boy Brewing West th and Blue Stallion are the three brew bars. The Beer Trappe and Glenn Creek have multiple craft beers on tap. You should also learn to love bourbon and go on some distillery tours.Keeneland is beautiful and great for people watching even if you have no interest in horse racing. The Lexington Farmers Market is downtown on Saturdays in the spring summer and fall. Its more of a street fair than anything else  lots of fun. There are outdoor concerts in the summer usually not with great music but its an enjoyable way to get out. Woodsongs Radio Hour broadcasts live bluegrass folk and old time music from Lyric Theater. There are your typical college bands that come through and some of the country pop and rock acts will play big concerts at Rupp.One of the great things about Lexington is that youre only a hour and a half from both Cinci and Louisville so you can enjoy all the concerts museums and sports that those cities have to offer as long as you dont mind a bit of a drive. I particularly love the music and restaurant scenes in the Bardstown Road area of Louisville.Since youre coming for Creative Writing you should go to Morris Book Shop and Joseph Beth Booksellers. Morris Book Shop is a small independent store that supports lots of local writers and brings in some touring writers for readings. Joseph Beth is a small chain based in Cinci but the store in Lexington is about the size of a Barnes amp Nobles. Still they have a good selection and tend to have good book signings. ,UniversityofKentucky,cgknel3,1,t5_2rb2i
