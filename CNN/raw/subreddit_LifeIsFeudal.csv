2125486,0,t3_2j2rmi,Good. I love people who are into real immersion. Not that BS OOC talk. IMO you either are in character or you arent playing the game. I love your story. Awesome me amp friend have something similar we use for our Minecraft server xDDThe only thing that would detract me is the combat. Okay I get no KoS for the sake of being a dick and for the sake of keeping out trolls but what if you RP that they are on YOUR territories? Boom theres a fight that will end in someones death or kingdom destructions. Soon a kingdom bands together to hunt down a crazy barbarian to teach him a lesson about KoS. Isnt that what the game rocks best at? Im an xcore RPer till the end but always hated how RP was an excuse to be squishy. That might be the only thing detracting me...,LifeIsFeudal,cl9zuva,2,t5_2yxdl

2451749,0,t3_2njl1t,In my old server my group got together in the to of the mountain flattened it and planted  quality trees built a  quality herb building only used  quality everything that was forged. And Basically created a temple dedicated to the the crafts. We would make  quality weapons for the leaders of each faction and even had the admin give us monk clothes. You should create something like that to give your best warriors after your tournaments. Or just gm them in Lol... it took us so long to tera form and build but it was with it I ended up trading others  quality flux for goods and services... it worked out really well it was awesome eventually the server went down because it got really quiet people started slaughtering each other etc,LifeIsFeudal,cmeqmnv,1,t5_2yxdl

2745379,0,t3_2ricr5,I dont have a lot of time to make a quality post before work but just to touch on a few things.PVP Excellent  kill anywhere be killed anywhere. It needs some balancing but its a lot of fun and the its exactly what you are referring to with the EVE Situations HOWEVER at this moment it seems to be semicommon for people to get quite upset over death and losing their stuff to the point they just go to another server and start over  which is lame.Server Stability Meh  its pretty bad honestly. I run a server that is the best Ive used by far but when theres  people playing and a lot of mining tunneling through the ground happening it does crash often. I would expect a server to crash once a day if they allow mining.Other Right now I feel this game is amazing and will be the best MMO ever  BUT at this moment I dont think you could expect to go play on a server that doesnt have active admins over  of the time policing it and have a good time. There are way too many broken mechanics and ways to grief someone. Ex  floating logs into someones base  hard to cathc that person who robbed you especially if they are a new spawn just logged in looked through your stuff took a bunch logged out and never log on the server again. there are many other ways to exploit in a base and grief people. The claiming system IMO is somewhat of an invitation to grief because if I claim your building I only have to find a  second window within the next  hours to log in and reclaim your building to lock you out for another  hours. There is nothing you can do about it but beg me to stop andor have someone posted there  hours straight watching it. Just my  cents. Still LOVE the game. Still pay for a  slot server. Still intend to until the MMO comes out. Come join us ! www.diplomaticgaming.com for server info and rules dont judge my shitty site! and diplomaticgaming.typefrag.com for the teamspeak.

2887716,0,t3_2ricr5,The Pathfinder Online game is attempting to be EVElike as described by its developers but in a fantasy setting. I believe the CEO used to work onwith EVE but I could be wrong.Not having been an EVE player beyond a twoweek trial period I cant really make a comparison of it to anything other than to say like other sandbox games LiF requires you to establish your own goals.I dont have a feel for how much you could change the game world in EVE.

So if you are crafting a sword there are several factors that affect ityour skill quality of iron the forge and the Hammer They all have a  that affects the final product. I have done a little testing with only a few weapons but there was a few point damage difference from a q axe to a q axe of the same type.
