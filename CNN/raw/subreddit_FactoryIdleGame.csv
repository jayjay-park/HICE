7688026,0,t3_4kjmbn,Similar to the way you might optimize an iron production line depending on your current upgrades you can tune your research setup to produce maximum research per research center. There are sweet spots for certain combinations. With research center max stock size  you can use  reports every  ticks. For the starting research center that takes metal reports you want to get  reports every  ticks which you can do with a metals lab taking both iron  and steel  for  reports and a second metals lab taking iron  for  reports a total of  reports every  ticks or  reports   ticks. Using two labs might seem extravagant when you only have  income  tick but it is a classic tradeoff between profit and research.With the research center  there is a sweet spot at max stock size   reports   ticks. Two gas amp oil labs getting both gas and oil produce      reports for  reports   ticks. Using only  gas amp oil lab with plastic will get you  reports   ticks for a lower operating cost but you are losing  of your research. Alternatively a gas amp oil lab getting gas  and plastic  and a second ga amp oil lab getting plastic  will produce  reports   ticks which would run two research center s.,FactoryIdleGame,d3g2w7a,1,t5_3ep1u
7695315,0,t1_d3gwbwf,Nice! Id made some improvements to mine since the OP but I think I should just jump ship to your setup.Also at a glance I think theres an extra researchtick to be had by linking that farright gas to the nearest lab I had that experience with mine and it was fine since the plastic is backed up.Edit same for the oil feeding that plastics where possible.,FactoryIdleGame,d3gwofo,1,t5_3ep1u

7818083,0,t3_4mdt16,Same here! I have a spreadsheet projecting when I hit a milestone. I should have hit it hours ago. Started the game at am and was projecting completing the milestone around . I checked in at  and I still have approx . hours to go. Im very short of where I should be.,FactoryIdleGame,d3utfn0,1,t5_3ep1u

7916450,0,t3_4npoty,conveyors can only move  part per tick or  parts per  ticks. Your upgrades are probably too high.,FactoryIdleGame,d45vtrk,1,t5_3ep1u

8397383,0,t3_4unji0,For gigafactory no upgrades.Its clear from the image that  explosives are produced through the bottleneck every  ticks. The goal is to without adding more explosives construct some system that distributes them to each of the eight conveyors on the right. Sounds trivial right? Just divide a conveyor many times and solved.HOWEVER! Without changing the factory remove one explosive anyone all of them are the same Clear Tracks run again... and only seven of the eight conveyors must receive explosives. One of them must be left empty. Keep it running no clearing tracks and the same seven conveyors must keep receiving explosives while one is left completely empty.Again without changing the factory remove another explosive Clear Tracks run again... and only six conveyors must receive explosives. Two of them empty.And so on until with only one explosive left all the explosives reach a single conveyor on the right while all the others are empty.Can you do it? Too easy? Ok then remove one garbage from each explosive conveyor so its  ticks per iteration. If its still too easy keep modifying the explosive production to make the iterations as fast as you can.Good luck!,FactoryIdleGame,d5r7xaz,2,t5_3ep1u
