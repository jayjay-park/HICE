5575038,0,t3_3rfkmp,I dont know why he doesnt like assigned theater seats.  I LOVE THEM!  We only just got them in the past few years.  I love being able to pick my seats online and not having to get to the theater in advance to get good seats  I already have them!I had excellent seats for The Force Awakens two whole months before I sit down to watch it!  I can roll into the theater  minutes before and not have to worry about craning my neck or being too far to one side.This is why I did not see Interstellar in proper IMAX Our IMAX theater does not do that plus since it is in a Smithsonian Museum you cannot have drinks or popcorn.  I saw The Dark Knight Rises from the lower right corner.  Still looked great but I would have loved a more central seatOnly down side is getting there again  minutes before the show starts and finding people in our seats who claim they did not know yet had to pick seats when they purchased their tickets.  If they were honest they would just say they did not think we were showing up.  But I am happy to kick them out.Now I always show up before the show starts.  I dont want to walk in front of other people who are already settled in even during the trailers.  But instead of showing up  minutes before to claim okaydecent seats I order online and get great seats.,weeklyplanetpodcast,cwo4vhk,2,t5_31np6

Better to know the genre before you break it down.The Dark Knight Returns was a great place to start for a number of years but in the time since its release there have been a number of Batman stories that are great and might serve as a better place for new readers.But I do agree those are probably still the two best stories out there and a must own for anyone serious about comics.  I have  copies of The Dark Knight Returns in different forms.

They just didnt irk me as much as some.But if the extended cut is in fact the cut Snyder intended to be the main cut as Mr Sunday suspects then itll be a seriously curious watch to see how it is.If the extended Watchmen is anything to go off then it should be good.I feel like Snyder is an artist who paints a beautiful picture based on a story in his mind.

8950499,0,t1_d7nm02m,gt the difference between Marvel and DC movies are how the companies are ownedExactly.  Someone needs to sit the head of Warner Brothers down and show him the Marvel movies before  the Marvel movies that other companies made before there was a Marvel StudiosI think WB think they are Disney who now owns Marvel Studios but they dont realize that Marvel Studios began their success on their own before Disney was part of the picture.  They made the movies and worked with bigger companies Paramount to distribute keeping creative control inhouse.Even if WB makes DC its own division DC Extended Studios? it will not be the same thing.  They never got a chance to actually run themselves plan ahead and make a good series of films.  They didnt even think of it until well after Man of Steel The Man of Steel sequel became a retroactivecomicbookuniversejumpstart mess that is Batman v SupermanThey sometimes get very lucky like with the Dark Knight movies.  That is the best we can realistically hope for.  Maybe Patty Jenkins and James Wan will be able to make something good and WBDC will push Zack Synder out finally.,weeklyplanetpodcast,d7nptbg,2,t5_31np6

James lives with his girlfriend they mentioned that Nicks been with his for a yearsix months at one point I think but I cant remember when that was. Itd be easy to work out their age exactly I imagine if you took a look at older episodes but I think its accurate to say early thirties. Nicks a little older than James so James might by late twenties. Sounds about right...Those are two specific questions. Heres a question for you if you read this post how are you finding distinguishing between their voices?
