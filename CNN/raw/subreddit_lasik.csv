2745398,0,t3_2rfwpt,I just went for my consultation on saturday. The lady that did my exam was an actual optometrist she does all the eye exams from the start and after the procedure. Im not sure if thats how every clinic does it but I wouldnt go somewhere that doesnt have a board certified optometrist  on staff. ,lasik,cng51s5,1,t5_2sihf

3737584,0,t3_32zb6b,lasikcomplications is one of several very vocal sites that have appeared through the years that strongly oppose refractive surgery. I guess the person or persons behind those sites are people who went through the surgery and had a traumatic experience.The complications and side effects on there have a basis on reality but do not reflect the overall results of refractive surgery. It is not the result of a study or anything like that more like a repository for complaints.I must include here that all surgery has risks and going through a surgical procedure that is not strictly required to save or restore function to an organ may be considered purely aesthetic by some people and you should weigh the pros and cons.My personal recommendation is that you read and research as much as possible before having your surgery if you have doubts. There is a clear economic incentive for surgeons corporations and clinics to sell the procedures but there is also an overwhelming majority of patients that had lasik prk and similar surgeries with very good results and satisfaction.You can check  regularly it is a magazine for eye doctors and may use some specialized vocabulary but you can get a very good idea of what is happening in the field.When I was about to get lasik the people in the clinic advised me against watching videos and learning more about the procedure I guess they thought it would scare me or something. I did not get lasik for other reasons but I have learned a lot about the human eye and eye care since then and I am definitely not scared about any of it now.,lasik,cqib4ks,1,t5_2sihf
4355920,0,t1_csgduov,Well the most superficial thing Ive noticed is that my eyelashes have become incredibly crusted like ramen noodles.  I have developed a bad habit of picking at them before I go into meetings at work but in three days Ill be clear to wash my face again which I cannot wait for and Refresh drops go to every hour instead of every  minutes.I also had a panic attack right after the procedure when I tried to open my eyes too soon the directions of You can watch TV afterward were complete lies.  Should have been Take the pain pills and take a nap.Generally speaking Im still incredibly happy.  There are some adjustments to make like having eyedrops on my bedside table to use before sleep and right when I wake up because I feel like a newly hatched chick in the morning.  I also havent dared trying to drive at night not even a little because I get some pretty gnarly halos and glares.  I dont know when I think Ill be ready.  Maybe a short late night errand in town.I have tried to take out contact lenses that werent there once early on and I about died of fright.  Thankfully I was due to see my surgeon for a followup the next day anyway.I am measuring at  or so but I have some trouble with items very very close to me like a torn cuticle on a fingernail.  I used to peer over my glasses for this and now I cant and its driving me a little batty.The biggest compromise is that for the past few days the eye strain has been insane.  I work at a computer for eight hours and then spend more time on phones and tablets and home computers like most people.  Some days I would have to stop whatever I was working on right at  and have to take a walk.  But you know what my pedometers happy the eye strain goes away eventually and I often need the break anyway.  I find that if I actively get away from my desk for parts of my day like sane people should the strain doesnt get so bad.  I might look into a pair of nonRx Gunnars.Showering has been interesting.  Ive been using a pair of swimming goggles and so its not terribly easy to get everything as clean as I want but it works for now.  Just three more sleeps until my four weeks is up.The most superficial thing Im hung up on is that because I havent been able to really really wash my face Im a mess.  So on Friday I scheduled a facial after clearing with my surgeon and hopefully I can get the acne back under control.Also for women your cycle may be altered from the steroid.  I had a mild Prednisolone? drip I had to use for some days and then I got prescribed a Medrol pack on top of that for some light inflammation stage  of DLK. And the drops made me miserable for the first few days a combination of my supertaster gene and the runoff into the nasolacrimal ducts.  Good thing I took the day off work.Still one of the best things Ive ever done.  The upkeep in the beginning is a little tiresome but I picked up my camera for the first time since the procedure the other day and its so amazing to be able to see without pushing my face up against my glasses.  ,lasik,csgn8hn,1,t5_2sihf

6915958,0,t1_d0z93hq,Thats good to hear. Someone else had asked that question recently but because of my age I wasnt a good reference. Youve likely got a good  years or so before it starts to go.

6986413,0,t3_4bd2p8,Does your vision in the affected eye get better when you put lubricating drops in? If so then the dryness could be causing the poor vision in your left eye. One of my eyes was significantly dryer than the other. Other than that really only time can tell. Everyones eyes have the potential to heal very differently. Continue to take good post operative care of your eyes and let your doctor monitor it and determine if you need an enhancement surgery.,lasik,d1890yr,2,t5_2sihf
7154613,0,t3_49p5d5,Thanks for the info. This helped point me in the direction of asking questions about PRK rather than lasik. Anti marketing is just as important as marketing folks.,lasik,d1req5t,1,t5_2sihf
7456070,0,t1_d2plt04,Ghosting is another name for doublevision. Most people suffer some degree of this during the healing process. As your clarity improves the ghosting becomes more noticeable. You will also like find the ghosting much more at night when your pupil is contracted not dilated. You can use a computer just remember to blink LOTS and use LOTS of artificial tears. Allowing your eyes to dry out will significantly impede your healing.,lasik,d2ppi1g,1,t5_2sihf
7519746,0,t1_d2wj0le,Its been  weeks and my visions about the same. I was told I have microstria which are tiny wrinkles in my cornea flap. They can take weeks or months to smooth out but they typically do so on their own. This is according to my doc last week. Its super annoying right now and hope it smoothes out soon...,lasik,d2wyi57,1,t5_2sihf
7919392,0,t3_4noza8,My doctor told me a dislodged flap is very rare. Shes only had it happen once in the last  years and it was dislodged within  hours of the surgery. Lebron James got lasik. Lots of other NFL and NBA players too. Ask your doctor if youre worried but I dont think thats a common problem.,lasik,d467qbz,1,t5_2sihf

9560344,0,t3_5bqnnp,Ive looked at TLC and Price Vision Group. TLC impressed me with the relaxed atmosphere and customer service.  Their technology is current as well.  They quoted me k for Contoura guided PRK which includes a lifetime satisfaction warranty.PVGs customer service was also quite good although they seemed slightly hurried at times but I didnt find this disconcerting. I was more impressed with the full evaluation that they did.  From start to finish it was roughly  hours long and quite thorough. They even went as far as to try to correct my astigmatism based on the topomap of my eyes using lenses. They also went to great lengths to explain the many risks associated with each type of surgery.  TLCs evaluation was only about an hour.  Dr. Price also seems to be on top of anything that offers an advantage e.g. fish oil and eye drops derived from  blood serum.  TLC did not mention these things. The final quote was  for PRK with Contoura. Followup enhancement surgeries are eye. I know people that have gone to Price TLC and .  They were all happy with their results.  After considering costs and how much more comfortable I felt after their evaluation I chose PVG.  Im scheduled to have the surgery in January and can let you know how it goes if you can wait that long. ,lasik,d9ribmp,2,t5_2sihf

10229227,0,t3_5mgm7q,Sorry. No sympathy. This is a surgery on your eyes. Why would you want to risk it if it would be unsafe for you? We get many many noncandidates at my clinic and as disappointing as it is would you really rather that the doctor operate on eyes that shouldnt have surgery? Sure we make money but its not worth the risk for the clinic or for you. ,lasik,dc3jg9u,2,t5_2sihf

Their staff has been nothing but great they treated me like a patient and not a customer but most of all they have made me feel absolutely comfortable during the entire process so far.

11090591,0,t1_dep1x9f,I had the surgery on a Thursday and went back the following Monday. After  hours I was cleared for computer use and readingcell phone useother close reading tasks in  minute bursts up to x a day. At the  mark I was also cleared for unlimited TV so that helped the boredom. I was allowed to go back to unlimited computer use after about  hours but tried to take lots of breaks. I work on a computer all day so Monday made my eyes a bit tired but definitely very manageable. Goggles were for sleeping for one week. I also wore them the day of surgery all day. After that no more daytime wear. If your doctor gives different guidelines dont be overly concerned unless it sounds totally different from anything youve read here. Different doctors have different guidelines. I get the sense mine is on the conservativecautious end of the spectrum but Ive followed all the rules and healing has gone great so cant complain. ,lasik,dep3xna,2,t5_2sihf
11103490,0,t1_deqizsa,The doc said it was a small scratch in the middle of the cornea and that its not too uncommon since I poked it by accident it was like I gave myself prk but the cells grow back relatively fast. My eye was really dry so I went ocd with my tear drops and now Im using refresh gel drops for longer relief. Its gotten much better but still took about a week for the haziness to clear up. Still not perfect but I can read about the same with each eye now but tldr much much better I was panicking because of the sudden drop off in vision. Moral of the story be ocd with the tear drops better safe than sorry even if youre a month or more post op,lasik,deqkkhc,1,t5_2sihf

11496829,0,t3_63hgyv,Rowbo I had the same exact issues when i had Lasik more than a year ago.I have been to  top ophthalmologist and trust me when i say this.THEY KNOW THEY EXACT CAUSE OF YOUR PROBLEMS they have seen it all the time. Lasik is a huge business for the whole eye industry and all these doctors protect it. So let start with floaters. I went to really go retina specialist that was honest after being to many that were liars. He told me that Lasik had caused what is called a partial vitreous detachment in both my eyes. He said there is a jelly called the Vitreous in your eyes and it is very sensitive. The reason why this happens after lasik is unknownMaybe the suction but this only happens to old folks as their vitreous degenerates or to people that get hit in the eye. High Myopes are more at risk.I did not have any nearsightedness goes to tell youI have loads of horrible floaters in my eyes. I found many studies that show a  incident of vitreous degeneration after lasik.BTW having vitreous issues will cause retina issues down the line I also have the problem of Feeling something is pulling behind my  eyes there are two causes for this. One is inflammation. So there are a lot substances in your tears. Your tears produce antihistamines and the sensors on you cornea tell your glands when to produce these antihistamines. Your cornea sensory is dramatically reduced causing all sorts of issues for many. Your tears also run through your nose with these antihistamines. That is why some complain of symptoms of sinusitis after Lasik. Another issue is eye muscle dysfunction. If you had different refraction in your eye your eye muscles learn to adapt with your poor vision. Now you do Lasik and throw that system off causing a you eye muscle to strain. Sometimes these muscle adapt again and sometimes they dont.Now talking to your lasik doctors is like talking to a dead bug on the wall. Although they know the causes. for me im learning to ignore the floaters i still get stain like pressure behind the eye year and half after Lasik. In short it ruined my life in many ways. Lasik is a high risk procedure signed off as safe. the whole eye industry knows and it is big profit that they dont want to stop. You will learn to cope with problems after a while Stay strong dont trust  of these doctors and good luck to you.   ,lasik,dfz5yaa,1,t5_2sihf
11712209,0,t1_dgnj211,Yes of course. Enhancements can fix astigmatism induced by previous procedures. But youre just two months in. A lot of microhealing are happening up to  months to a year after the operation so there will still be changes. Hows your overall vision? Have you seen an optometrist?,lasik,dgnlwtw,1,t5_2sihf
