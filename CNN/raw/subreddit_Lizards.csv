4068158,0,t1_crjzujh,Yes he was definitely doing that to the smaller female. I didnt catch him doing that with the larger one though. Sorry I couldnt get a better picture. These guys were very skittish. Not like newts. I could walk right up to them. I guess they are so toxic they arent afraid of much.,Lizards,crjzy9v,2,t5_2tqk0
