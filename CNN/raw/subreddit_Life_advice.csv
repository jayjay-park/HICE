8165706,0,t3_4qksdb,Somebodys going to kill me for this I just know it. But you havent had any advice and its been three days so here goes nothing. Say to those with fearful hearts Be strong do not fear your God will come he will come with vengeance with divine retribution he will come to save you. Isaiah  Normally I wouldnt put up religious things because people would accuse me of shoving religion down their throats but as Ive said before you havent had any advice for three days. So dont be afraid to leave your house or to do anything. Gods got your back. Somebody out theres praying for you I will and when they do just know that Gods watching out for you. Ok? Good luck. I dont know what else to say to that. ,Life_advice,d4y9gfq,2,t5_376nu

11430311,0,t3_5txaqb,Frozen veg Spinach peas and sweetcorn go in everything I make. I also buy pickled veg like saurkraut for about jar and have that with noodles.  A jar lasts a while too. Spinach and banana smoothie with protein powder if you can afford it is my go to breakfast.Sounds like you need more protein which I know can be expensive but keep a look out for end of the day reductions in stores.And eggs!  Omlette with frozentinned veg is easy and awesome and cheap.,Life_advice,dfrm3q0,1,t5_376nu
11654026,0,t1_dggssci,So my mom and stepdad yell alot and punish harshly for small things. Luke my brother forgot to vacuum and she made him sit in the bathroom for around an hour and half after she already hit him. Well the day we came back to my dads house we couldnt find him until we heard sobbing from a closet and found him curled up in the fetal position crying. His face was just blank and I was kind of freaked out because this has never happened before. ,Life_advice,dggzy9d,1,t5_376nu
