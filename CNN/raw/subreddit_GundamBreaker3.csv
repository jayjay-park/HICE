8186196,0,t1_d50t5k5,Thanks for doin all that leg work ! Ive mostly stuck with the DRAGOON because it looks cool as hell. I did have the Kshatriyasp? arms the strike freedom backpack and the epyon shield for the whip.In Dragoon mode with all the funnels out using the binder spin dash and the epyon whip youre unstoppable. It just melts through everything. I really need to quit building new MS and just beat the game for the harder difficulties.,GundamBreaker3,d50tq3n,2,t5_3eg9h
9605314,0,t3_5camko,Just looked on the store and came to say the dlc is out! Seemed to pass the Englishspeaking community by.   Worth it? Not sure about the season pass yet.,GundamBreaker3,d9x1va7,1,t5_3eg9h
11707670,0,t3_66ns2d,I dont believe it does. Logically speaking if it did then there would be no need for the Asia version. I dont really have proof though.Since Im not  sure all I can say is that your safest bet is to buy the Asia version unless you can refund the Japanese version but thats a problem by itself.,GundamBreaker3,dgn3eng,2,t5_3eg9h
