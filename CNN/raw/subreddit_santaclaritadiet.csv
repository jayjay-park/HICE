10788942,0,t1_ddsrfzv,While I see your view on a number of your points I do disagree somewhat.Joel definitely admitted that he peaked in high school but based on his house and the lives his family lived prior to the events of the show he does seem to be successful. Perhaps his wife is the better realtor the show infers as much but he still must have some skilltalent.Also I dont think his wife approving his weed use one way or another is relevant. Her character was very much made out to be a prude before zombification so she likely had a grudge against it along with morning sex per the pilot further adding to her prudeness. Joel still smoked previous to the events of the show he just hid it from her.Also aside from smoking weed I dont think the show has given us much evidence to show Rick is a shit cop. To your credit the show hasnt given us much evidence to prove he is a good cop either. I am definitely making the assumption that he is a good cop based on Ricks personality and involvement in with his family. But season  could prove me wrong.,santaclaritadiet,ddsswr6,19,t5_3d800
