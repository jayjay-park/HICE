21581,0,t3_1ud3gb,pH balance is a factor for sure and most shampoos or conditioners that are balanced say so on the label. My main concern for you is getting protein back in your hair. Try using Redken CAT treatment blue bottle spray on towel dried hair let sit for about  and rinse. Do this once a week it will help rebuild the proteins in your hair and retain elasticity which gives hair strength. DO NOT leave this product on longer than the recommended time on the label too much protein will make the hair crunchy. Just follow the directions and youll be fine. That should help a ton! Also try not to wash everyday lay off the blow dryer and flat iron if possible and if not please use a heat protecting product. If you arent already using a professional shampoo and conditioner please consider getting some try Redkens reconstruct line I think thats the name should be in the same blue bottles as the CAT treatment. Let me know if you have any questions.,femalehairadvice,cegw230,2,t5_2sgxv
34092,0,t3_1ud3gb,Hey there! Bleach addicted Licensed Cosmetologist here  First be careful about adding too much protein.  It will make your hair brittle and dry if you overuse.   Invest in really good product. Kerastase has changed my life.  I used Organix products and they dried my hair BIG time years ago before school. The Super Skinny contains silicone and while temporarily will make your hair feel FANTASTIC will eventually do the same.  I also highly recommend buying organic cold pressed coconut oil.  At night Make your hair a greasy mess slap on a shower cap go night night  and wash out in the morning.  Your hair will be silkier and look better.  Other then that be kind little heat little brushing regular trims. It will get there eventually just have patience. ,femalehairadvice,ceib9oc,1,t5_2sgxv

3915827,0,t1_cr27fih,Yeah...you probably should have just waited.  Ok you might be able to try to get this toner out with washing with dish soap or shampoo and baking soda.  You could try some  volume peroxide in shampoo to try to lift some of the purple out as well.  Whatever you do those methods will make your hair not feel so good so follow that with a hot coconut oil treatment.  See if this helps to red rid of some of the effects of the platinum toner.  Note these methods are for getting rid of hair color and they should help but if they are done on your whole head they might affect any other dye in your hair that you actually want in there.Or to cancel out the purple parts you can try to tone it with some yellow.  Im not sure if you can find a semipermanent yellow dye to tone it.  So add some yellow food coloring to a nice thick conditioner preferably a gel food coloring instead of a liquid.  This is easy to apply to just the parts you want just the parts that are purple and wont be crazy damaging but I dont know how well it will work.  Whatever you do dont keep piling dye on your head right now.  Just try to get the purple out.  Hair dye might not be able to do that then youve wasted more time and money and damaged your hair again and maybe gotten more unexpected results that still need to be fixed.  ,femalehairadvice,cr2n1xw,1,t5_2sgxv

5010983,0,t1_cupvpyt,If you have bleached your hair at all recently I would be extra careful.  I ignored almost everything I read about bleach and perms when I was in a rut with my hair and decided to get a perm on hair bleached a month previous.  My hair takes bleach really well doesnt feel damaged when I dye it overall really resilient and healthy.  The person I went to had given me great cuts in the past and maybe I should have backed out when she mentioned she hadnt done a perm in over a year but I went through with it.  I left with my hair crunchy all over the next day had breakage even though the front half of my hair had no curl whatsoever and by the third day I had to call it a loss.  I have a very very short pixie now.Just be real careful and make sure you absolutely trust your stylist if your hair has been bleached recently.  Ask how long its been since they last did a perm and be completely honest with them about the dye history of your hair.To get an idea of how it might look you might want to try a heatless overnight curling technique to see if you think it suits you.  Something like straw curls or those foam twist roller things would give you temporary curls like your pic to experiment with.  Itd take maybe  minutes or so to get all rolled up but theyre not that bad to sleep in.,femalehairadvice,cuq0hdm,2,t5_2sgxv

5742981,0,t1_cx8jmjm,Wow thank you so much this was nice to find in my inbox What do you look for in a leavein oil or whats that one on amazon? I feel like I love the idea of oils but Ive never found one that makes a really appreciable difference besides maybe smelling great.As for the products that sounds intriguing P I live in Ireland though so its far from everywhere and shipping would be expensive. Maybe I could pay PampP at least? Idk I dont want to be a huge hassle!I havent done much with contouring but I will some day. Id love if I could do a kind of localised contour just to take away some chinjawline. Most days Im very light with makeup I barely ever do full face or even a BBfoundation coverage to be honest. Maybe I should change that P But Im very very lazy.In the end I didnt go for bangs the stylist and me both felt that it was a risk with curly hair and all. I got really defined layers cut and face framing layers that rise up to my cheeks. I still dont like leaving my hair down too much especially since theres nothing I really do to style it. I like wearing it in a really high pony with the face framey bits left down I think it looks nice I hope P,femalehairadvice,cx8z0mr,1,t5_2sgxv

I think the style will really suit you but you could always have it an inch or so longer so you can still tie it back and it wont take long at all to grow out to shoulder length if youre not keen!,femalehairadvice,cxzn5gr,2,t5_2sgxv
6011935,0,t3_3xs4hv,The cost of going blonde is staggering and infuriating.  Its no wonder people do it themselves.As much as you love your hairdresser you should shop around some more and really question their colorists think of it as a job interview and youre the one hiring.  Youll be going back frequently so you should ask what deals they have loyalty programs etc.  Opalex is all the rage at the moment Ive never used it but you can see heaps of positive reviews online.  It drives up the cost so you might need to consider how much youre willing to spend. Depending on your hair type youre looking at at least  visits plus touch ups for your roots.  Youll need to be prepared to lose a bit of length as your ends dry up.  There will be breakage so youll end up with fly aways.Youre going to need good quality conditioner and treatments to help your hair along.  Coconut oil is great but recommendations from your stylist should be considered too.  First time I went blonde from dyed black hair my hairdresser recommended a product and I used it religiously and damn it worked!  My hair stayed healthy.I went monthly to have my hair bleached and Id say it took about  months to get it platinum.  It was quite healthy and I didnt lose much length though my hair was only shoulder length to begin with.It probably cost me about  to get to that point that includes some salon treatments I decided to indulge in.Putting any sort of bleach in your hair is damaging it.  So once you start this process you wont have the same condition of hair you do now.  Good luck!,femalehairadvice,cy7ozim,1,t5_2sgxv

6893037,0,t3_4a4bkx,So a few things about all of this.The purple tone itself is definitely not the same as the purple tone you showed her from your chalk picture however chalk vs actual color is always going to come out more intense on lightened hair and it could be from the lightening process your hair didnt take the purple fully.HOWEVER this seems to be more of an unclear communication between you and your stylist. If youre judging your end result to the original picture you showed her she gave you that result in terms of the color placement. The OP you showed her is of the purple framing the edge of the models haircut with subtle lavender and some pink in what looks like accent parts.If you told your stylists you wanted to do that purple look I guarantee she saw the outlining purple and understood you as wanting that.When you brought in the chalk purple picture did you say that was how you wanted the end result to look or the color tone to be? If you brought it in and just stated oh this is the color I was imagining she is completely at fault for JUST THE TONE. if you stated you wanted your complete end result to look like this then she needs to completely redo this. however understand if you did not explain that chalk placement was what you now changed your mind to want that it really is your fault for not being clear youve changed your mind and want more than what you first showedstated and therefore you may have a bit of a charge for the change.Honestly if you call and just explain you wanted the current purple more vibrant make sure you use that sort of verbiage. Vibrant neon bright etc you shouldnt have an issues.I think if what you now have was made a bit brighter itll look nice and give you a fuller look. If you want it to be as harsh of a placement as when you did the chalk well make sure you REALLY want that cause purple is a nightmare to get out without damage and from the picture of you with chalk it honestly makes your hair look heavy and the stringy damaged look on your ends. Im not trying to be mean just honest. Ive gone through the colored hair phases like that and looking back at photos it wouldve saved me a lot of cringe moments if someone had been honest to me about some of those color choices. ,femalehairadvice,d0xn6or,1,t5_2sgxv

Its super daunting especially since youre getting married and you want your hair to look long and pretty but trust me when I say you would rather have slightly shorter but luscious curls in your wedding photos than long hair that looks flat split and dead. rcurlyhair is a great place to start but Ill give you a cliff notes version. Find a DevaCut certified stylist in your area. They can be pricey but it really depends on your area. I got mine cut recently for . Its much higher in NYC where my sister lives. A DevaCut is a specific way of cutting curly hair so it basically looks like a movie stars hair. Full defined curls body etc. It is SO worth what you pay for it. I lost almost  inches of hair because it was so damaged but she cut it so well and it looked so good you couldnt even tell. The next thing is ditch your shampoo and find something sulfate free. Theres a list of curly girl friendly products that are sulfate free in the sidebar over at rcurlyhair. If you do go to a DevaCut stylist I recommend asking about the DevaCurl nopoo and conditioner.

If you recommend a salonists touch I have a few questions if not you but someone anyone may answer allany of these. My cousin is a hairdresser she particularly works with Redken products as well as a few other varieties of brands. Just mainly Redken dyestreatments etc.  If I were to for example have her dye them with Redken Color Chromatics which toneshade should I ask her to order inuse specifically? . Color stripping first? Can I do it myself or should I wait? Ive done it before quite a few times obviously no professional but I fear wrecking the extensions because this is their first dye job and it is also by box. . If I can remove the color on my own can I jump the gun if I get good results buy another box dye amp get a tub of deep conditioner from Cousin to preserve them through the process? Thank you for the moral support by the way. Very kind of you to look out for my wellbeing through a screen.

I dont know if it will work for you like if cutting it short will make any difference for you but I find it a lot more comfortable with short hair. I had shoulder length then chopped it. Im never going back to long hair.The only thing to consider coming from someone who also has fine hair that your cut isnt going to look exactly as it does in the picture.

10712085,0,t3_5t7o11,Hairdresser hereNeed to see your faceface shape to determine the best cut.When deciding a cut for a client hairstylist always look at face shape and facial features so we know what to do. Example Have a wide jaw Im not going to make any face framing layers or bob end right at your jaw as that will make it look even wider.If you dont want to show your face then we cannot give good advice and people who are giving advice who are not hairdressers wont be giving sound advice either.  Your best bet is to find photos of celebs who have a similar face shape to yours and somewhat similar hair type  and bring those photos to a hairdresser. We are professionals who have experience in dealing with all different face shapes hair types and textures. We listen to what you want and what you have troubles with and then come up with a plan that you also agree with. ,femalehairadvice,ddkvdr8,0,t5_2sgxv
10733382,0,t3_5tjvqh,I love it! Im trying to grow mine back out but your pics are making me crave those short locks again. ,femalehairadvice,ddn2gjn,3,t5_2sgxv
10840318,0,t3_5uvq71,A really loose wave pattern requires a certain length to show as youve discovered. I have A hair and my hair doesnt curl unless its got about  in length. You need a tight curl pattern for it to be curly when its short.So growing it out would help but in the meantime check out rcurlyhair. Youd probably benefit from mousse or a light gel scrunching in your product and using a diffuser to dry it. Plopping may help too. ,femalehairadvice,ddy3ono,1,t5_2sgxv
10960510,0,t3_5wh66c,Im not good at conveying how I want my hair to look either. I like to save pics of what I do like as well as sometimes examples of what I dont to show my hair stylist. I also have specified Id rather err on the side of too long than too short esp with bangs. Can always have more nipped off. Is there a style youre leaning toward?,femalehairadvice,deahz64,2,t5_2sgxv

11074881,0,t3_5wxabm,I dont have thin fine hair but I kept it short and spiked for years.  I used to have very bad dandruff too like went to a dermatologist because the hairdresser was concerned about an underlying cause dandruff.  To help my scalp I used    It melts very easily.  I worked it into wet hair and sometimes used it to style instead of hairspray.  For shampoo I use   But it has a sulfate in it.  I dont shampoo everyday and added in a conditioner.  ,femalehairadvice,denbt8g,2,t5_2sgxv

11223695,0,t1_df2ys6r,Thanks for the response. This was really assuring to read!Diet is the last thing I wouldve thought of in terms of hair thinning. Now that I think about it that most likely is my problem! I went out and got some Biotin and will be giving it a try.Thanks again! Your response was very informative and helpful.,femalehairadvice,df46x7o,2,t5_2sgxv
11279930,0,t3_60xrf8,I thought it was the opposite. I thought ash colors bright out redness in skin since itd contrasting and red would by comparisonmake the redness on your skin less obvious? ,femalehairadvice,dfakar4,5,t5_2sgxv

11398990,0,t1_dfo1el9,oh thank you so much!!! i  think you can get organ oil on the black market LOL.  ok then id advise for you to use just pure argan and not coconut its super lightweight but you only need id say  drops of it ! have you tested the porosity of your hair yet? drop a strand in a cup of water and wait for  seconds. if it sinks youre high porosity like me. if it floats your low porosity. knowing this makes all the difference in what products you should be looking at! good luck D,femalehairadvice,dfo27a1,2,t5_2sgxv
11487083,0,t1_dfy231g,Sure!I have hair past my shoulder blades right now because I have no idea what else to do with it.Im willing to entertain anything! Really Im totally flexible but my hair is very straight and generally even with pretty aggressive styling falls flat in  hours or so. I have a lot of hair but the actual hair is very soft and thin like childsoft. ,femalehairadvice,dfy25g9,2,t5_2sgxv
