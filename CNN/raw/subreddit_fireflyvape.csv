8738595,0,t1_d6xxbm9,Sorry I think theres a misunderstanding. Im not changing the heat setting while Im inhaling Im changing the heat setting periodically between draws as I continue to use up the material. When a bowl is fresh I start on low. Then after  or so draws on low I do my next few draws on mediumlow and so on. I really dont think that the FF knows when a bowl is fresh or not... I completely understand that each heat setting has its own heat curve but thats for the entirety of the draw while you are engaging the heat then it resets when you let go. Im fairly certain Im not in the wrong by slowly ramping up the heat settings over the life of a bowl right?,fireflyvape,d6xz2tl,1,t5_329gr
