6243542,0,t1_cyxvzvu,SPOILERS AHEADThe reason I loved The Force Awakens is because it takes all of the mythological archetypes and turns them upside down.At the beginning of A New Hope its pretty clear that Luke is Hero Vader is Villain Kenobi is Mentor Leia is Damsel etc. But what about Force Awakens? Both Rey and Finn could play The Hero. But then we have Finn demonstrate a lack of aptitude no Force and Rey reject the Talisman lightsaber. And then what about Mentor? Han Solo? Chewbacca? Poe Dameron? TFA takes these archetypes and turns them on their heads. Rey who as a female would historically have been the Damsel. But then she discovers her abilities and is the strongest candidate for the Hero. Kylo Ren the clearcut villain may not be so clear cut as we see the use of red and blue light symbolize his internal struggle between the Light and Dark sides.The Force Awakens presents us with a framework we are familiar with Heros Journey  A New Hope and totally spins our preconceived notions of archetypes out of control.,mythology,cyzbmp3,2,t5_2qus9
6495108,0,t3_44jx9o,That depends when it comes to some cultures. Many people in Japanese or Yoruban legend became gods. So there are a number of gods who are also human. In fact this is true of most religions though its less prevalent in some. I cant answer your question though. For as much as Ive researched world mythologies I havent done so looking specifically for humans vs. deities. I personally imagine there being more gods than humans in most mythologies even Greek stuff. They were more ubiquitous and thus thered be more stories about them than about madeup humans.,mythology,czr54o5,1,t5_2qus9
6528451,0,t1_cztmzy0,Yes that article isnt doing a great job identifying its sources. And I do agree that Endovelicus is fascinating. Being both a solar deity and a chthonic underground one certainly isnt common.I think most of the info we have on Endovelicus comes from the inscriptions found in the temple in Sao Miguel da Mota. Some of those inscriptions are housed in Portugals National Museum of Ethnology. Unfortunately their site  isnt particularly helpful if you dont speak Portuguese. Perhaps you can find more info on Google Scholar and JSTOR?,mythology,czuldul,3,t5_2qus9
6838962,0,t1_d0rhsxj,Theres a lot of great books out on mythology. I personally am interested in Greek mythology and when I started getting into it I picked up the book Mythology by Edith Hamilton which Im sure is referenced often in this sub  this is where I learned about it!.

9130134,0,t3_55ahsj,I cant speak specifically about the Fates but I know the beliefs of both the Greeks and the Romans were rather fluid. There is a good chance the Romans adopted the Greek position on the Fates. Also it should be noted that these stories werent universal by any means. The analogy I hear and most like is that myths were like comic book movies. They very from telling to telling but they have certain things in common like personality traits superman is a boy scout Hera is a jealous wife and basic story aspects Zeus overthrows his father SpiderMan is bitten by a spider. In fact if you look up the gigantomachy youll find several different endings. Keeping that in mind you may be coming at this wrong. Considering the plurality of their beliefs its likely that a fair amount of Greeks didnt believe in the Greek stories about the Moirai while a number of Romans did. What Id suggest doing is looking into when the Percae appeared earliest mention at least and see if it correlates with the hellenization of Roman culture. If their is a correlation than Id say its safe to assume that they shared similar roles. I cant speak definitively on the subject as the Moirai occupy a different space in Greek mythology than any of the gods did. ,mythology,d89b6g3,3,t5_2qus9

10220812,0,t3_5m99ha,Well the issue I think is the misunderstanding that Mythology means untrue stories when they are just stories told by various religions. Calling something not true of practicing religions is obviously a big issue that is hotly debated.Truth is even if say Noahs flood was  accurate it would still be a Myth but due to change in nomenclature it becomes an insult.,mythology,dc2l49s,5,t5_2qus9

11338199,0,t3_61hicp,Just finished The Craftsman by Richard Sennett.  Its a philosophical examination of work and craftsmanship and its connections to our consciousness and ethics.  One of the themes he brings up through the book is the contrasting myths of Pandora amp Hephaestus.  Hephaestus was the god of craftsmen he made the palaces and weapons of the gods.  He also made Pandora the first woman amp the cause of untold misery amp destruction. He uses these myths to highlight the dual nature of craftsmen in society. Hephaestus represents the craftsmen when they work for others in a socially conscious way they advance society and can create great things.   But Pandora represents the danger inherent in their craft the ability to create things that can destroy amp throw society into turmoil amp chaos particularly when they focus only on perfecting their craft but are indifferent on how it is used. ,mythology,dfh5yef,3,t5_2qus9
