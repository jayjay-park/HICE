Gas leak is definitely the source fire captain said the gas will be shut off for the area around the building with no idea how long itll be off. Looks like its only the Star Design Group building that caught fire. My neighbor said she heard three small explosions sound off. Same time I live  blocks away but didnt hear anything until the fire trucks arrived and the news helicopters were overhead they still are. Met a guy who lives on that block. He said that when heading to work this morning he saw a crew with a back hoe digging into the corner near the building. After the news story broke he came home from work to see what was going on.

601440,1,t3_2115bk,No.To expand on that besides the questions being repetitive and easily answered on Google people have a nasty habit of not including enough details. I get that theyre fishing for the unknown unknowns but the best way to do that really is to establish a social network face to face or online and then ask those people. Or better yet just see what places your friends go to. That works for restaurantsbarsclubs usually. Instead people want to ask questions like what are the best restaurants in St. Louis? every damn week which is something that has no definitive answer. Half the time when you ask follow up questions for more details you get no response or a useless response.The visitors from out of town who want to know what the best places are what cool things are happening while theyre in town etc.  well thats what the sidebar is for. A little research before asking questions about specific places is going to give them a better result than asking openended questions. Some people dont roll that way and thats fine but they really shouldnt expect everyone to be cheery about being asked the question repeatedly either. This aint the tourist bureau. If you want to go update the wiki every week with the latest information so people can tell at a glance whats happening without having to gasp look at the RFT calendar or something feel free! Have fun!The flip side of that is that some people dont mind being lazyweb resources and thats their decision. I sometimes feel like giving useful answers and I sometimes feel like telling people they are stupid.Protip the worst way to get people to behave the way you want them to on reddit is making a post like this.

835205,1,t1_cgz7l3x,For one thing Lyft and Uber seem to increase the demand for rides by making it much more convenient and dramatically cheaper to get one. So that may affect the elasticity of demand. They are also matching drivers with riders and drivers dont go around looking for fares where there arent any at a particular time. So that makes supply match up very closely with demand. Pricing isnt set by individual drivers so thats not an issue.

1246682,0,t1_ci9umbz,Can only speak to my perspective. The original design from my understanding did not account for some of the realities that has happened since they were penned and ultimately more operational realities resumed the task of a day to day functional airport terminal. At first it was a terminal devoid of obstruction sitting on a gentle hill with grand views on the nearby highway . In my minds eye I see a modern Art Museum overlooking art hill. While obviously not that sedate with activity associated in an airport. The activity only reinforced its intended purpose and the beauty of it. The addition of the garage came later and further developments also took away the grandness of design. As far as parking goes the airport was lacking in its planning. Long before much of the development on the south side of  happened the airport could have picked it up for a song. In fact they thought of such a thing early on for airport expansion in the way of an additional runway. I am not sure what killed that idea but it could have been. Internally the addition of kiosks addition of poorly thought out residence of fast food in the west corner took away more of the open air and intended design. It darkened it a bit and cheapened it further. Again I look at things like this in an idealistic way most architecture for me as I drink the kool aid is art art that can be used. Practical people have a point in the demands placed on them I just look at it more wistfully is all. The dominance of security presence also removed some of the natural flow originally felt. Operation reasons may have dictated it despite my own personal feelings. But overall at my age the overwhelming presence is in stark contrast to the romantic and hopeful future the design felt at the time it was commissioned. Despite its use I still think the decisions made over time detract and I would bet if you were to ask which terminal is better most would say the Southwest one at this time. And for me that is sad. ,StLouis,ci9v8ej,4,t5_2qpnm

1591994,0,t1_cjfbeqt,I dont think there are any particular secrets. Practice etiquette be prepared for some weirdos add a half hour to your planned commute time just to be safe.It usually costs me  dollars a day to commute to work and back. Thats two  hourtransfer passes one each way. For me its not worth the pass because I usually will have a ride from a friend at least twice a week and dont commute often on weekends. A good rule of thumb is if you plan to commute on the metro at least once roundtrip every day the pass is definitely worth it. Otherwise remember that buses only accept cash no pennies and do not give change. This should change in about a year when they roll out the metro cards you will be able to add money to.Ive never used the ten ride pass but it is true that often no security will come to check your validated pass. Often you can get away without buying but its a risk that includes a fine and court summons. On the flip side bus drivers are usually understanding or indifferent. If I only have a five dollar bill theyll just wave me on sometimes rather than having me overpay. Same if Im a quarter short on fare. Its not worth being late or confronted for them.The only line Im familiar with in Maryland Heights is the  from Westport Plaza and you can actually take that all the way to Grand and then either take the  or walk south to the Metrolink.

Its most notable feature is a degree bend occurring at the middle of the crossing. Originally a motor route the bridge now carries walking and biking trails over the river. A new Chain of Rocks Bridge carries vehicular traffic to the north. The old route to the bridge is now called Chain of Rocks Road and ends near Roman Road. Parking is available at the start of the now pedestrian route. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in . gtThe bridges name comes from a large shoal or rocky rapids called the Chain of Rocks which made that stretch of the Mississippi extremely dangerous to navigate.  Because of a lowwater dam built by the Corps of Engineers in the s little of the Chain of Rocks is visible today except during extreme low water conditions.  After  only a single impediment prevented the maintenance of a safe and reliable foot .m navigation channel on the Mississippi River from St. Paul Minnesota to New Orleans. This impediment known as the Chain of Rocks Reach was a mile km series of rock ledges that began just north of St. Louis and was extremely difficult and dangerous to navigate. In the late s and early s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a .milelong .km canal to bypass this treacherous reach. To ensure adequate depths in the pool below the old Lock and Dam  a nonmovable low water dam was constructed just below the north end of the canal and a lock was installed at the south end of the canal.

If charges are pressed and first degree murder is sought for the officer you want as impartial a jury as possible.

I know many of them arent from Ferguson however. edit to add I think this is the story youre referencing where they talk about  arrests. Maybe you assumed they were all from North City and East St. Louis? They dont mention where they are from but the county prosecutor says they are all well known by his office which leads me to believe they might mostly be from the county. This article is the only one I know of that list where the people arrested were from. Six people were from the county and two were from North City. None were from East St. Louis.But really the point Im trying to make is that now is not the time to be pointing fingers at people  minutes down the road from you and blame them for everything.

1682931,0,t1_cjra1hc,True but if he was fleeing from danger and hadnt gone for the gun there would be no reason to utilize lethal force. In a situation involving ones own safety it is difficult to fault anyone for running. Now had he gone for the gun and apparently had the officer known about the robbery at that point which is up in the air then it is a lot harder to call what he did surrendering and a lot easier to see that a potentially violent suspect that had just struck you and attempted to grab your gun is now escaping into the city and lethal force is now legally authorized.

You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murrays case physics. In mine show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardreversing cause and effect. I call these the wet streets cause rain stories. Papers full of them.In any case you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story and then turn the page to national or international affairs and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

If they want to ask like children treat him like I treat my  year old son.. if you do not follow the rules given to you by the person in charge in this case clear the street order given by police.. no second chances.. in jail you go with a heavy fine.

1721667,0,t1_cjw5npm,first off thanks for sharing the full video.. well have to agree to disagree because I see something different when I watch the video.. first off the guy recording it despite criticizing others agendas.. clearly has a antipolice stance.. around the  min mark he makes a crack aboutgtpolice using these other groups that have their own agendas to do their jobsTo which he is referring the police coordinating with local community leaders church pastors teachers etc. to assist with keeping things peaceful. I would assume this is an action we would all support yet somehow he views this as shirking responsibility and causing the crowds to be more angry his words not mineThat said I see this citizen journalist note not actually media talking to random people and then when there is a commotion as a result of what he admits he is unaware ie. orders by police to clear street for emergency vehicles? etc he runs directly towards the commotion. As people are yelling to some of the group dont throw anything ie. someone or multiple people are instigating response from cops by throwing something probably rocks andor bottles from reports he further runs directly into the street that they are trying to clear. When he sees and says guns raised he steps forward into the face of the police offers trying to clear the street and starts provoking him with the sarcastic my hands are up bro dont shoot me catch phrase.

He always used to say that during construction the two halves of the arch didnt meet at the top due to a simple math error made by some engineer or architect. I just looked it up. It was true they didnt align properly but it was due to thermal expansion on the sunward facing leg. That son of a b lied to us. During construction both legs were built up simultaneously. When the time came to connect both legs together at the apex thermal expansion of the sunward facing south leg prevented it from aligning precisely with the north leg.

That was before their Framily plans started.  I took both phones to Ting.  Ting charges you based on your useage.  Since we are mostly connected to wifi and dont use a ton of minutes my bill is usually around .  This month will be a bit higher closer to  since I went camping and used a lot of data there and playing Ingress.  One month I had no cell phone bill at all thanks to getting referral credit.  Ive saved close to  in less than six months.  Ting has excellent customer service.  A real human being answers when you call them.  Its remarkable. You just need a Sprint phone that is listed on their White List as a compatible device which is most devices that are over a year old.  They will get the iPhone s next Monday.  If you decide to give them a try you wont be locked into a contract.  Theres a calculator on the site that will tell you what your bill will be with them if you know your useage.  They will also partially pay for your early termination fee and help you swap your phone for a device you can use.If you try them please use my referral link and well both get  off our bill.  ,StLouis,ckqmd4g,1,t5_2qpnm

The QuikTrip that was destroyed was destroyed because . It was probably the nicest place in the neighborhood and . It was the first thing they saw on their way to rip up everything between Canfield and West Florissant to Chambers and Vickie Place.  Why they never made the Mobil at Chambers and West Florissant suffer the same fiery outcome is a mystery. Probably because the Mobil wont card them for tobacco like QT does.Do I need to share that picture I made yesterday for the Outoftown protestors only remake it for them now?Heck it feels less about police brutality lately than it does race relations.  Do they actually believe their sit in was a success? It would be a success if they fed all the bums that keep asking me for money and smokes neither of which I carry but I figure Ill eventually get assaulted for just so they can take my wallet full of maxed out cards they cant use and a phone they cant hawk.

2193145,0,t3_2k6y4v,gt... Michael Brown was unarmed and thus unlikely to have presented a serious threat to the life of the police officer. As such this calls into question whether the use of lethal force was justified and the circumstances of the killing must be urgently clarified.As others have pointed out this statement makes me iffy. It is imo a perfect hindsight statement that can only be made because it did not occur. As somebody who has been tackled by a lb guy I am willing to say that should that every occur during a violent confrontation I would be incapacitated enough for it to be a danger to my life. This then detracts from the following message which is Id like to believe nobody can argue againstgt For years the monitoring of police conduct and excessive use of force has been hampered by the failure of the Department of Justice to collect accurate comprehensive national data on police use of force including the numbers of people killed or injured through police shootings or other types of force.Another perfect hindsight statementgtHowever the responses by state officials and law enforcement to the violent actions of a limited number of protestors have impacted the rights of all participating in peaceful protests.In retrospect this sounds perfectly reasonable but being that I wasnt there on either side its hard to say whether the crowd was on edge or not. The judgement of an action should be made in the context of the time and place of said action which I think is my problem with the first part of this report. The following sections of the report Im skimming seem more impartial. And largely I agree with their statement on handling subsequent protests or how not to handle them. Something I didnt know and maybe I still dont fully know is the inconsistency of dispersal order. This sounds like something completely at fault with the leadership of the police in not following procedure. And the media restriction thing... there was no way that was going to end well especially after Occupy and Chicago. The face of media is changing and it is confusing for everybody about who actually press vs somebody with a phone but at the very least you dont specifically target them. morning rambling ,StLouis,clilpkv,4,t5_2qpnm

The breads I typically make are the socalled artisan breads where I have a starter of natural yeasts or yeast itself but those breads are partly to transport some other element like jellies and jams or meat etc. but I also allow my bread to ferment overnight or for many hours and it develops its own natural flavor.But breads do not need oil or butter to work.

What has changed though is new evidence that contradicts the answers and justifications Dotson used to explain the incident.If you think the discussion about police tactics are important then lets have that discussion. So far your discussion has revolved around this isnt new. Do you feel like this was a proportionate response? Should the precedent be set that private businesses can be targeted for police action? It was targeted and the proof is in the videos. If you dont believe it was targeted then please explain the can of gas at their doorstep. You can call that semantics if you want but it seems pretty clear to me.The larger area was at Grand and Hartford blocking traffic not at MoKaBes. No one as far as Ive seen was actively breaking any laws outside of MoKaBes and for lack of a better term was peacefully assembling. What issues were they having? In the previous post we have video footage showing that the glass smashing had already occurred and those businesses were being protected by citizens and police therefore no longer a threat of looting.So my point is if we want to talk about police tactics and response lets do it.

I can memorize some things for a short while!  worthless.if you want to advance in your networking career figure out what certs will get you to the next level and take them.  decide if you want to specialize in storage or voice or whatever and get some related certs.  or all of the above.  but the bottom line remains  if your employer doesnt look at certs for advancement or looks at certs that arent the ones you took take a netapp cert but they only look at EMC? then getting more certs is mostly a waste of time.  you can download the training material and learn on your own anyway and know just as much as someone with a cert without the inconvenience and stress of taking a class.,StLouis,cnan14z,1,t5_2qpnm

You can get a bike for  that a bike shop will sell for double that. If you dont know your size just email them which models you are looking at and theyll tell you what size. With a screwdriver a set of allen keys and a few youtube videos you can get everything assembled and tuned up in about one hour. Bike stores are ridiculously overpriced and for some reason people who are into biking think you need a  bike and  in other bullshit to go ride. All you need is a decent road bike or a single speed a little seat bag for a tube and a co pump and maybe a light if you plan on going out at night.  Bike people love to go insane with their gear but unless you are trying to join a racing team its not necessary.

3590275,0,t3_31g8io,I would highly recommend The Grove Forest Park Southeast.   Its safe affordable and you can easily walk to the Central West End or to the Metrolink to take a five min ride to downtown. Id recommend the north side of Manchester. Safer than downtown but easy access to it. Lots of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and friendly neighbors. Theres a great mix of housing including lofts and single double and multifamily. More places on the way as its a booming neighborhood.  Personally I feel downtown lacks green space which is why I like the Grove because its right next to Forest Park. The recent violence downtown is unnerving but I dont think it should scare anyone off. Its mostly gangongang shit that boiled over from the north and is quite uncommon.  If you really are interested in downtown Id recommend something closer to Busch stadium or south of Olive if you can afford it. St. Louis is great because you can get anywhere in tenfifteen minutes via car or public transportation. If you live downtown with a car it will be more expensive.  ,StLouis,cq1ioyq,4,t5_2qpnm

4377803,0,t3_3b2oy5,I did my own single story sq ft house with Snow Roof at least  years ago. I used their Elastoseal as an initial primer coat then a thick coat of the same in which I imbedded their Polyester mesh and another thick coat on top. Then I finished with  coats of Snow Roof Including patching materials and some felt roll roofing material to try and flatten out the low spots I think I spent around  back then. I was getting bids from  for anything from cold mop tar to membrane.My flat roof house had just blown in paper insulation in the ceiling and old leaky doors and windows at the time but it made a  difference in the inside temperature of my house unscientifically measured at the thermostat. It lasted about  years before I needed to reapply but since I couldnt find the product around town anymore I bought it from Builders Square when they were closing I went with another product from Lowes Black Jack roof coating. It worked just as good and applied just the same. If you decided to DIY some tips I learned after the first time Power wash the roof. It doesnt have to be spotless but the cleaner the better.  Take the time to build up the low spots with felt and roof patch so you dont have standing water.  Start as early as possible but late enough that the condensation is gone. I did mine in JulyAugust both times. It was HOT.  Bring a water cooler up there with you. See above. Once you get up on the roof after carrying all of the heavy ass buckets and materials you dont want to come down until youve coated the entire roof.  Finish well before the sun starts setting otherwise it wont be dry the next morning and the evening condensation will ruin your install. I could only manage one coat per day doing it alone. Also someone mentioned using foam sheeting and plywood. This is something Ive thought about and may still do once the remodel is finished. Im using closedcell spray foam in my ceiling along with new windows and doors and a new HVAC system. Ive thought about using the spray foam on the roof then coating it with the same Black Jack material if needed. You might look into that and see if its in your budget. ,StLouis,csj445f,1,t5_2qpnm

We ponied up for stadium upgrades and just a few short years later we were asked to build an arena downtown with a promise to attract an NHL or NBA franchise. Well we still  dont have a new team but team owners in cities like Pittsburgh and Seattle have used us as leverage over their tax payers to put them in the same headlock. Then The Wizards changed to Sporting KC and moved to Kansas and Kemper Arena sits empty.In the end we got an All Star Game a few college basketball games every March and one of the most popular venues for watching sports events on television PampL District across from the Sprint Arena which is basically a concert venue but they expect us to ignore the fact that they gave us a bunch of empty threats and empty promises.You probably wont lose the Rams and its probably not worth the price to keep them.

But what moderate means in this case is people who claim to see the problems with the system but would never do anything about it  people who see the mass incarceration of blacks as a black problem rather than a set of criminal acts perpetrated by St. Louis whites. Direct action forces individuals to take a side. If a brief highway disruption is too much for them to handle then theyre never going to be willing to take the steps that will really solve the problems  a real end to racist housing segregation real school equality real equality in policing. Some proportion of selfstyled moderates in St. Louis wouldnt slow their commute for five minutes for a black man or woman  were better off once their kind is outed for who they are.I wouldve felt like this sounded excessive five years ago maybe but check out what happened when Frances Howell North was ordered to take Normandy students Perfectly moderate parents became something entirely different almost overnight.,StLouis,ctzs4oo,1,t5_2qpnm

I personally really like Joyce and think she has done a lot for struggling women. She was sexually abused by her father and has been able to turn her life around and use her experiences to make a difference in a lot of peoples lives. Shes a remarkable woman but definitely not perfect as no one is. I cant say I believe in her plastic surgery or the private airplane she used to have but shes human like all of us. If youd been through the sexual abuse she went through you may make a few selfish mistakes. She did end up getting rid of the plane because there was so much controversy around it which shows that she cares. She has written a ridiculous number of books. Any other author Christian or not isnt criticized for using their profits to live in nice homes. My husband used to work for Joyce Meyer Ministries and they treated them very well. All the donations were put directly into helping people. Her current income only comes from book sales from external sources i.e. Amazon and Walmart.

So they are paying less in taxes. If it wasnt built they would be paying zero taxes on it. So some money is better than no money. Its also going to help provide local workers with a paycheck for a while who will be spending it locally. It doesnt seem like a bad deal its just people are throwing in unrelated issues like school funding or healthcare.

Peacock and Nixon will do everything in their power to make sure the contract has no out clause for  years.  As for your question.

5888703,0,t1_cxrivs6,Resources are scarce and there are many different ways to make use of them. The profit motive helps directs investment where society demands it most at a proper price to avoid oversupply and shortages. Freely made decisions are the way individuals express their subjective values and signal entrepreneurs where and how to do business. Political processes do a far poorer job at that because people cant make as many decisions for themselves and they violate individual rights in the process by using force against peaceful people to accomplish others subjective goals.Private businesses are subject to both profit and losses. Loss is also an important signal but government is insulated from that. The result without that signal is less efficiency i.e. higher costs and lower quality.I think our goals are the same. I want zoos and all manners of products and services to be inexpensive so that the most people can benefit from them. The way to accomplish that isnt by monopoly but through a market of choices. History demonstrates that this is the absolute best way to increase efficiency and lower prices over time. I think itd be ideal for everybody to have a smartphone with Internet access also for example but it would be a disaster to socialize the smartphone industry. Likewise zoos would certainly be cheaper if the profit and loss system were allowed to inform the industry vs. political whims.No matter what system is in place it will always be the case that things cost money. Thats true of the zoo now. Charity is a noncoercive method for helping people afford things they otherwise couldnt.,StLouis,cxrjjz1,1,t5_2qpnm

5898851,0,t1_cxsv0km,gtI wish but as it has been pointed out several times a large chunk of this money comes from the hotel tax that wouldnt be allotted towards decent improvements like that.Fine but why increase travel costs for visitors to our city? Taxes affect demand and there is no free lunch or stadium. gtAnother thing to think about is that keeping the NFL team here is good for the metro as whole as its just another thing to draw people here.  Studies show that there is no effect of new stadia or teams to increased immigration or income. I think myself that it makes sense but the data doesnt bear it out. gtHow could the money be used otherwise? As someone else posted the money the city is spending and the money from the state cant be allocated elsewhere for some reason.  Not sure why we cant just change the legislation for use of the money.  But this shiny big shortthought building on the riverfront in the name of urban renewal is too big of a draw. If we dont tax that money it goes somewhere else. It really goes back to the seen and the unseen of Bastiat. How can we know what the residents would spend their money on that was just taxed from them? We have almost no idea. But if we know that the stadium is just a useless money pit that has no net benefit then we know we shouldnt spend it that way. And I believe the only draw is the big building reflecting in some superficial way on the strength of local and state governments.

6227731,0,t1_cywtrnt,Hi! Resident Economist popping in again! Tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue are only lost if the money is literally not spent anywhere else in Saint Louis. For example if the hundreds of millions of dollars that would have been collectively spent on Rams tickets apparel and other goods are instead spent on more Blues stuff or dad takes the family to the city museum instead of a Rams game or even if Mom buys timmy a League of Legends hoodie at the local hot topic instead of a Rams hoodie from the Rams store that all produces identical tax revenues for the city. The odds that people literally sit on their money are marginal. Please note that this doesnt mean that the Rams produce zero revenue for the city its just much less than you may be thinking here. Tax revenue is only lost if people  sit on their disposable income which is highly uncommon or  decide to spend their money completely outside the city.  There is a net tax increase from people coming from outside the city to visit but a net revenue decrease from expensesdebt incurred as a consequence of building a new stadium with public funds. It is not clear that something like an NFL team draws in more visitors to a city than many other attractions do. Most attendance for local sports teams comes from local fans. In short dont just swallow the NFLs pitch whole. It isnt like NFL teams are a huge burden on their cities or anything but its not nearly as clear that theyre great for cities either as the NFL would like you to believe. Their economic analysis is facile. ,StLouis,cyxixgc,7,t5_2qpnm

But that doesnt get the County to the table which is the ultimate goal. The County doesnt have the crime problem and is sound fiscally relatively speaking.The City certainly does have its assets but when you get past the superficial stuff i.e. the things that dont have a direct impact on economic prosperity the County trumps the City by a mile. Just think of Clayton by itself. Im not even sure if there are any semiHQ offices in downtown anymore a lot of satellite offices but regardless it doesnt measure up to the wealth being generated by the companies in the county Ed Jones Centene Enterprise Monsanto etc.Completely agree with the PR angle most people see through this but regardless it looks bad for everyone involved.gt Like it or not in many ways the City and County live and die together and there is every reason to join forces. Even though I live in the City the City is not the only one pushing this issue.Im for the consolidation but like you said the County isnt coming to the table to discuss. People need to take a step back and think why that is. The City needs to bring something to the table to incentivize the County. Im not saying the City doesnt already have this socalled carrot but the current regime isnt doing a good job of uncovering what the bargaining chip may be or nor are they seemingly developing one.,StLouis,cz87o47,1,t5_2qpnm

If they want to open up and fail thats fine but its insane to me how any sane businessman would think it would work. I grew up in the Loop and MPH failed because of greed and because of trying too hard to cater to sports fans andor WashU students. Sports fans never went to the Loop for games and WashU students preferred BH and Three Kings because they were simply better and less cliche. I was actually in the focus group for the place before it even opened so I know exactly what they were trying to do.

Normal remodels probably got rid of a lot of it while possibly making things temporarily worse if care wasnt taken.  There is some newer tech that makes remediation cheapereasier. Agents that encapsulate better than paint or wallpaper. Paint strippers that render the lead nonhazardous during removal.  With some protective gear a lot of it is DIY. Its not like lead testing is that expensive . Nobody is forced to buy a home with lead paint. I cant imagine that remediation is not part of the inspection  negotiating process except in the poorest of areas. Testing for led poisoning isnt that expensive either unless youve got no or crappy health insurance. I  think its a poverty and education issue as much as anything else. The poor get screwed in many ways this is just another. I really dont think this is as big of a deal outside of lower middle class and worse areas.

6916192,0,t1_d105ikq,Theres a lot of differences between police and airlines.  For starters uniforms are usually purchased by the officers themselves.  Departments issue guidelines for what they have to wear.  There are many companies out there that make duty shirtspants.  Duty weapon policies also vary.  Some departments like the metro PD have issued service sidearms.  Others have an approved list and officers acquire their own weapon from the list.  Police cars arent that big of a deal.  Its Dodge Chevy or Ford.  And there are going to be differences between model years.  In the case of Southwest Airlines where their savings comes from is the fact they only have to type certify their pilots to fly s.  Pilot training is expensive.  So their pilot pool can literally fly any of aircraft in their fleet since they are of the same type.  Problem other airlines have is a pilot certified to fly a  cant say fly a .  That being said flying a  is a hell of a lot different than flying a .  At least when it comes to checklists.  ,StLouis,d109ul3,1,t5_2qpnm

By business I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry by workers I mean all workers the white collar class as well as the men in overalls and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence levelI mean the wages of decent living.  ...gtNo employer and no group of less than all employers in a single trade could do this alone and continue to live in business competition. But if all employers in each trade now band themselves faithfully in these modern guildswithout exceptionand agree to act together and at once none will be hurt and millions of workers so long deprived of the right to earn their bread in the sweat of their labor can raise their heads again. The challenge of this law is whether we can sink selfish interest and present a solid front against a common peril.  FDRIts no accident that wages have been stagnating for just about everyone since the fast food and retail industries became economic monoliths in this country.

7548248,0,t3_4imubs,Airline consultant here. Lambert Airport STL is a pretty good airport built to sustain a whole lot more traffic than there is today... Background STL has excess capacity after being a major US hub for TWA. Back in the day we had regular international flights and jumbo jets taxiing to the C Concourse from Europe. It was one of the busiest in the country. Lambert even went through a major expansion maybe  years ago building the new Runway  in what was a residential neighborhood in Bridgeton a billion dollar project. This was done because it was so damn busy at STL that they needed the extra capacity. However in January  American Airlines announced it was buying TWA. This made things shaky for Lamberts sustainability. Flights began to decrease as American began rerouting connecting flights to their hubs in Chicago ORD and Dallas DFW. Then September   changed the nature of airports making things rougher for all travelers and especially those in older airports like STL that have to adapt to new standards of security. The hammer came down on STL in  when American slashed the number of flights in and out of STL by more than half. Subsequently the decrease in passenger traffic relegated multiple concourses at the Main Terminal to ghost towns. Concourse D the old TWA Concourse is almost fully shuttered today. Goodbye international flights and s hello connecting flights into the hubs at ORD and DFW. The worst part for STL is that the new  Runway was just being completed when American cut their flights by more than half. To pay the debt on the bonds STL now has very high fees relative to other airports on airlines for takeoffs and landings. This keeps many flights from coming in and out of Saint Louis. Even worse the lack of direct flights out of STL today hurts Saint Louis as a place for businesses not in Saint Louis to create jobs here preferring to locate in cities with hub airports. Seriously job growth in the Saint Louis region is sluggish partially because there are so few direct flights out of STL. The great news is Southwest which fills the East Terminal with traffic all day many with direct routes around the US. They are doing so many flights out of STL that theyre beginning to expand into the D Concourse. If were lucky theres the potential of new Southwest international flights into Mexico Central America and the Caribbean out of STL. Knock wood. A couple years ago STL was hit by a goddamn tornado and right in the middle of a MM redevelopment campaign. And honestly it was the best thing for STL because the insurance policies paid off for them and allowed the construction to continue with new monies in the bank. C Concourse is looking pretty good these days even if the s arent pulling up right now. This week STL is asking the STL City Board of Aldermen to increase the amount of monies they can retain to support its own economic development and services by almost half  to  This will mean better food offerings and other economic development monies for things like maybe cargo. Air Cargo which is my focus is important for STL because fees for takeoffs and landings are partially assessed by the weight of the aircraft STL can make more money off a plane full of heavy cargo than a plane full of passengers and their baggage. My hope is that the revenue increase may mean decreased fees to the airlines with the resulting cost savings leading to more flights on bigger aircraft going in and out of STL. As for the regular inandout there are some decent food offerings some beer bars with good local brews passenger traffic is minimal with the excess capacity it has a wonderful midcentury modern aesthetic baggage carousels arent too shabby in the Main Terminal. I fly SWA when I can. All I usually eat there are donuts and coffee although there are vending machines serving Ted Drewes Frozen Custard. Good times. Note I am not under the employ of Lambert Airport. ,StLouis,d3076th,2,t5_2qpnm

Always has been and always will be. Totally false!

8036667,0,t1_d4jds9m,Way back in the day businesses took entrylevel people who needed skills straight out of high school and trained them to do a job.  Secretaries didnt need Bachelors degrees and programmers learned their skill at work.  No one needed to go to HVAC school they joined a union and got an apprenticeship.Somewhere along the way someone probably with an expensive liberal arts education decided that this training expense could be offloaded onto the people and made their responsibility.  And as a consequence entry level now means a four year degree plus internships and a portfolio.Its a real racket and who profits?  The overeducated underskilled clerks and businesspeople of the country or universities colleges and corporations?  Bachelors degrees are the new high school diploma so what do you think youre getting for that  grand that used to be free to you and me?  A corporate subsidy thats what.And like I said with athletes paid in scholarships and adjuncts paid k per class no benefits its even more profitable which is the important part.  Everythings commodified in this model instructors students the education itself.  Your question shows this fact.

That is where the statistic is derived from. This means that a large portion of the dense urban area is divided from the suburban area.

This year there were a few sections like the divided street on Russell that just felt like they were funnelling a lot of people into a street that wasnt big enough to hold them all. Also sending people up the hill on Holly Hills was another huge bottleneck as the narrow street plus the slowpokes strung our group out especially since one of our foursome wasnt as experienced of a bike rider as the other three.I still had fun but I preferred the route through Forest Park that was used last year.,StLouis,d6s9jh8,2,t5_2qpnm

So how would we do it?We could think of all sorts of good ways to do this but just about the dumbest possible thing we could come up with would be to let different people randomly draw borders around parts of each region so that some regions included the suburban parts and some didnt so that some included rural outlying areas and some didnt so that some made up only a small part of their surrounding area but others made up a large percentage so that some had rigid geometric borders but others had borders that snaked lazily around the area so that they looked like a drunk persons sketch of a starfish.That would result in a truly insane way to compare regions.But thats exactly what youre doing when you measure using only whats inside the borders of a regions core city.Ill just keep trying to think of new ways to make this point.,StLouis,d88qfpm,1,t5_2qpnm

Over threefifths of them  percent are currently enrolled in school.Not quite the picture some are painting.gtThis is why the two previously mentioned topics are intertwined. With the decline of blue collar minimal education middle class jobs many of these people have been forced into low paying service industry jobs. So instead of getting them back into better jobs lets toss a few bucks at them and forget them?gtHow is a single mother working  jobs supposed to dorm it up and complete college in their free time? Thats a deep hole that a higher minimum wage isnt going to eliminate. Its also a corner casegtJust  percent of minimumwage workers are single parents working fulltime compared to . percent of all U.S. workers.Dont optimize for corner cases. gtThis just seems like such a low effort way to brush off anyone in this situation. Not everyone can afford to go to college to be programmers or be programmers for that matter.Found the programmer.gt My point is go to college is not a one size fits all solution to the weakening lower and middle class.Community College.

Who would have guessed one could travel in the high s with bald tires  the need for a driver to traverse lanes with ambiguous regard to anyone else is so important and really sets the tone for what can be accomplished if we as Missourians just simply stop obeying any rules.

11437506,0,t3_637sve,Well charges suggest there is at least smoke in the case but after seeing movies like The Hunt great movie if you havent seen it Im very very wary of ganging up on people on this sort of issue. It seems to provoke people on such a powerful emotional level that they cant think rationally and the last thing I want is for an innocent person to have their life forever ruined by allegations like this. Even if youre acquitted the stench can last a lifetime limiting all sorts of options for an accused person. Even saying the above probably has some people looking sideways at this comment thinking This guy is suspiciously accommodating to accused child abusers. What is he hiding? Its such a poisonous topic that even requests that everyone stay calm and rational are treated with contempt and suspicion. The whole situation is awful. ,StLouis,dfsfi2d,4,t5_2qpnm

11597595,0,t1_dg97l2c,Me too and I think its asinine that people want it painted however... I do like murals.I grew up on a farm and if there was a campaign to make this happen I would be on board only if the painting represented how farming has progressed since we stopped being nomadic huntergatherers.Eli Whitneys cotton gin is a notable big first in mass agriculture but the big innovations started with the tractor and the combine that actually should have been called a separator.   Haha something we always laugh about back at our farm  a group of kids from St. Louis are on a field trip and they ask what that big thing is over there.Its a combine.What does it combine?So yeah Im onboard for a big farm mural but in reality Im not so sure the owners of the silo are.  Yet... it never hurts to ask if it could be done if outside money was brought in to cover the costs plus insurance plus liability plus... well I doubt it will happen but one can wonder.edit  My grandfathers farm started with his kids picking ears of corn out of the field in the s until he could afford a combine.  Also of note my grandmother always told us she cried her eyes out when my grandfather bought her her first washer and dryer.  And going back even further my greatgrandmother used to make dresses out of flour sacks because times were rough during the Depression era and then the flour companies took notice.,StLouis,dgalgnl,6,t5_2qpnm
