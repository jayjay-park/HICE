8817389,0,t1_d76wha6,I didnt add a hard reset because I didnt think anyone would want it and I figured someone would do it accidentally but Ive had it requested a few times now so I guess Ill add it.As for the maxsafe option Im not sure how it would handle buildingsunits that kill every second. I suppose it could calculate how many enemies there would be when the cooldown reaches  but well I dont want the computer to do EVERYTHING for you. P,lazykings,d77qayh,1,t5_3fsd8
