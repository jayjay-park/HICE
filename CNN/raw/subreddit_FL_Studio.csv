62721,0,t1_celje49,Harmor can be used for more than just basses. Just play notes a few octaves up...You can fade between waveforms in Harmor as you can in massive. But in Harmor you arent limited to the preset waveforms Massive has. You can import or even make your own waveforms. On top of that Harmor has many more effects and utilises more types of synthesis subtractive additive wavetable resynthesis and samplebased.You can definitely make drums with Harmor theyre even in the factory presets orchestral sounds pads basses and leads too.,FL_Studio,celkjun,1,t5_2rig0

120367,0,t1_ces4pmf,well that certainly shouldnt be happening. however if you see the meters moving and those channels are routed to an audio output then the kick must be running through all of them. so either youre seeing something wrong or youre hearing something wrong.select your Kick insert mixer channel and take a look at what its routed to. it should only be routed to your main drum bus and if you have one your silent Sidechain bus. It should not be routed to the Master channel or any of your other drum channels. if it is routed through your snare and hat inserts disable that path click on the little arrow at the bottom of the insert.im at work and wouldnt be able to check your FLP right now but perhaps another generous soul could do so.,FL_Studio,ces4y86,1,t5_2rig0

The first lessons in week  of the course were sort of a primer on the physics of sound which is important to understand and forms the basis for everything else.You can do your assignments as essays but dont. Learn how to do a screencast I can help if you need it just pm me. Youll learn more from doing your assignments than you can imagine. Also I learned a ton from evaluating classmates assignments.The message boards for the course were invaluable. There are literally people taking the course with you that are either practicing musicians songwriters and others that work full time in recording studios.It can be hard work but the more you put in to the course the more you will get out.Id love to hear how you like the course.,FL_Studio,ciejq4c,2,t5_2rig0

2236652,0,t1_clnxi0t,So with radio waves you have a carrier signal at a certain frequency which your radio picks up. It then strips some information off the carrier signal and plays it out the speakers. For amplitude modulation the information is carried in how much the carrier varies in amplitude volume from its base amplitude. In FM the information is carried in how much the carrier varies from its base frequency.The music production stuff you can take from this video is visualising how the carriers wave pattern is altered by the audio wave which modulates it. However unlike when listening to an FM radio we actually hear the carrier too. If we stripped the carrier out well we could just have used the modulator straight with no carrier. See because we arent using radio waves to send audio out long distances we wouldnt need to use a carrier. But we use a carrier because modulating frequency offers some cool ways to get new sounds. Sounds that are very difficult to get just by overlaying different waves on top of each other to create harmonics additive synthesis or filtering an already harmonically rich wave like a saw or square wave subtractive synthesis.gtA side note Sytrus is capable of both additive and subtractive synthesis. If you have Op  outputting only unmodulated. If you click on OSC you can shape the wave by overlaying sine waves top bars and altering their phase bottom bar as well as sending multiple Ops to the output without any FM going on by leaving the  knob matrix alone. For subtractive synthesis can route Op to the FX or three filter F F F units where you can filter the sound.FM often has a distinct sound to it. Im thinking of that bass sound where the modulator has a velocity envelope with  attack and a short decay I think. This is offhand. It sounds like BOW BOW BOW! Also organ leads like Robyn S  Show me Love although that was a Korg M its a super easy sound to make and UK garage basses and donksAnother cool production related thing is the limiter shown near the end of the video. It is a good visualisation of what a limiter plugin would do to a signal.,FL_Studio,clo4rmm,2,t5_2rig0

Hes switching between a DXstyle organ bass and a distorted square wave.For the organ bass check out Dexed which is about the most realistic DX emulation I have ever heard. The organ bass you want is in the original sysex its not hard to find with some googling.The distorted bass can be made with just about any synth you have access to. I like TAL Noisemaker because it is very fast and easy to use. Make a bass with the primary oscillator being a square wave and overdrive it in the mixer channel. Yum.,FL_Studio,cok9hrl,1,t5_2rig0

3241877,0,t3_2x819o,Kick I use the BassDrum plugin which lets you use  oscillators for the low endpunch as well as a top end click and a top sample layer. I usually follow this up with a minimal amount of plugins EQ transient shaper a bit of waveshaping maybe multiband compression for the midtop or NY compression. I always keep the kick fully mono.Snare Not really a layer but I will usually take Drumaxx and set it up so all bank things are blank except . In bank  I will keep it dead center and either create a snare patch or load one and modify it. When Im happy with that Ill copy it and paste it into bank . Then I make bank  hard left and band  hard right. Now I have a pretty good dynamic stereo snare sound but it will usually sound very weak.  Now it depends on my mood and the song here but it is always followed up by a pretty long chain of plugins. Maybe a reverb followed by a noise gate mixed in slightly some extreme EQing usually some very hard multiband compression in Maximus so I can also set the bass dead center and saturate the mids and highs followed by some EQ and maybe some NY compression. Its always different and lots of fun to do.I do all this in Patcher so that my mixer only contains mixing plugins and the Patcher instances only contain sound design plugins. Also you can mix together each section of the chain at any point which is nice.Hats I do the same thing with hats as I do with snares but I hardly use any plugins at all afterwards maybe a slight highpass and minimal EQing but thats usually it.,FL_Studio,coy10lj,1,t5_2rig0

Have a Vocodex be on a rd channel with both Sytrus and the Vocal channel routed only to the rd Vocodex channel.

You can work either way though.Limiter on Control peaks if youre doing mad sound design that might peak everywhere. Prevent clipping.Limiter off You have full control of dynamic range  headroom. Your mixes arent being squashed for no reason. Limiter isnt interfering with your mixing levels.During arrangement production and mixing you generally dont put anything on the master since you can worry about master levels and final limiting during the mastering stage.

6310702,0,t3_421vlx,It looks like you may have gone a folder too deep. My setup is a little bizarre and I have two folders in Program Files that hold my VST. Theres a Steinberg folder that a lot of my VST wants to default install to and then theres also a VstPlugins folder. After reviewing my files it looks like I even have a Waves folder in there as well. Im not very tech savvy but I looked up an article about Junctions?. Maybe somebody else here can elaborate on them. I created the junctionlink if thats what its called and placed it in CProgram Files xImageLineFL StudioPluginsVST. That way any installations to the Steinberg or VST folder will automatically be referenced in ImageLines VST folder.Afterwards load up FL Studio and add the VST. If its an instrument right click on the step sequencer like youre normally adding an instrument. Right click the Sampler then go down to Insert. At the very top of that menu click the option More. From there you can do a scan for VSTs which FL Studio will then detect and you can check them to make them appear under your instruments. You do the same thing in the mixer for effects. Be sure not to add an effect as an instrument and vice versa for instance a thirdparty equalizer should be added as an effect on the mixer and not as an instrument on your step sequencer. Hope this helps!EDIT Heres ImageLines recommended method A bit more orthodox.,FL_Studio,cz6yfoh,2,t5_2rig0

6810183,0,t1_d0m7kfj,What an interesting but different track.  Okay so I loved the sound of the opening synth but personally wasnt a huge fan of the very slight delay it had which made it seem off time.The second half was super cool and I liked it a lot!  But the heavy bass drop in the second half was super jarring and I wasnt expecting it.  Lastly the ending felt kind of out of place to me.All that being said...

6811791,0,t3_48yiue,OK here is a GIF describing the problem. To summarize Its a visual issue that arises when you use audio files with variable tempo. Its not a stretching issue nor is it a playback issue. Your waveforms will simply not align visually to the grid even though the audio is in fact playing in sync.The slicing workaround that ukurtnirvna suggested partially addresses the problem  as long as your playback marker is in the relevant section the slice will look right but all the others will look wrong. Its also very easy to mess up the slicing by having the playback marker in the wrong place when you slice. Clearly ImageLine could fix this.,FL_Studio,d0oewf6,1,t5_2rig0

Try it out in maximums im sure the first  samples one will do it. Put a kick a snare and a hat though looping. Put the saturation knob to the right side and then turn the gain knob to match the original volume. Then put it on mono and it should go to shit. then to the left it will be louder usually. or more crisp since its better for mono idk why oStuff like that i was missing becasue without checking sometimes it sounds better. but its just louder. its so hard to explain but so many times the new thing you bring in or are doing your paying too much attention to. Blind to it kind of. Either you dig it new lead loud mm reverb. or the new settings will have a higher output either RMS average volume or peaks.. and like above maybe its wider and louder but really in the car its gonna be a bad time. Phasy. And im saying you can saturate the drums just the tiny ass little bit. It will reduce the peak and wont change the sound if you do it right.Yo i have the akg q  and a scarlet i that i dont think even did enough to drive them properly. I mean i dont know for sure but yeah. I read it needs more power than what mine does but didnt read into it cause i wasnt gonna buy anything and it didnt interest me. Maximus with RMS mode on will help. MB is multiband compressor. Maximus. I like it. Dont even use an eq before it just use the hz cutoff. Sometimes  bands is too much. Dont always multiband the effects. If you send me the stems ill at least make you a few patchers i cant promise to fix the kick its so hit or miss but if its one kick it should be workable..

For the shaker I would bring it in a after a certain number of bars and possibly create a simple yet catchy loop with it that will bring it a more upbeat element.LifeBeautiful! The intro is perfectly executed and the plucks pull you in perfectly. Great job!PureI like it! The progression was well done in an orderly fashion but I think that the clap pattern you have starting at  might be a little out of place. I would recommend sticking with a standard  clap. Overall I very much enjoyed it.ParadiseOverall solid material. Only think I would recommend is adding a reversed riser with reverb for the vocal at  otherwise it feels to sudden.CloserA unique and refreshing melody!

Currently Im not able to listen it using my monitors or neutralsounding headphones so I dont have anything specific to say about the mixing but it sounds pretty good through cheap headphones. The levels seem to be quite nice. I dont know that much about structures of dnb songs but some breakdown without the arp would make it more interesting.

9214147,0,t1_d8je9zb,delay actually isnt an echo without mixing with the dry signal... the way that delay effects actually create an echo is by feeding back the wet signal into the dry signal so that it repeats like an echo or simply having a wetdry mix of less than  so that you hear the delayed signal along with the original signal but delay itself is actually just delaying the signal just to clear that up a little bit ... what op is talking about is delaying the triggering of the note I imagine they are attempting to compensate the midi playback to be in time with the rest of sounds that are going through various effects that introduce delay as a result of processing I dont know if that is what OP is actually trying to do but its an educated guess based on what they asked and experience with the same kind of issues.,FL_Studio,d8jymld,2,t5_2rig0

One thing I do is get midi files from the web and assign them soundbacks then listen to the original mps or so for comparison trying to match the mix mastering could get in the way but you could use a mastering plugin set to a preset that works for the genre of the song meanwhile you work on the mix,FL_Studio,d9wmxs2,1,t5_2rig0

Maximus I sometimes put it on pianos to make them a bit more noticeable amidst other instruments. AudioDamages FuzzPlus . Its a pretty great distortion plugin though leaving the window open eats a bunch of CPU for some weird reason. I use it very slightly on drums pretty often.

10806472,0,t1_ddu0ksd,Thanks for the feedback! As far as the sweeping synth sounds Im not sure exactly which ones youre referring to. There are two that I think might be the ones and in both cases the VST is Sytrus. The sound that comes in at about  seconds is the Grinder preset and the pads that come in about  are the Heaven preset. I added a slight cutoff filter to both but otherwise theyre pretty much left asis. Other VSTs used in the mix include GMS Harmor FL Keys and PoiZone. If you want to know more specifics I can give them to you.The drum pattern is just a collection of sounds that were included with the program with minor adjustments and filtering for volume and cutoff. The main kick is called Grv Kick  and the one that comes in at about  seconds is DNCClubKick. The hat pattern is DNCHat and Grv CH  layered on top of one another while the snare is Grv Snareclap . They are fairly simple yes but that was pretty much the intent for this song since I wanted to make it something you could just sit back and chill to.As for the part that gets quieter thats a break by design to transition from the sweeping padsbridge to the main groove. Its just percussion and lead similar to the very intro of the song.Again thanks for your input and let me know if theres anything else you want to know.,FL_Studio,ddum0ys,1,t5_2rig0

Because a sine wave has only one harmonic the first. Which is also the last. Its the Alpha and Omega the lows the mids the highs and even the shimmering sparkling air that only children audiophools and wily gear salesmen can hear and quantify. Its the vertical band on a spectrum analyzer a primary monadic color of the sound palate.  And thats why you cant filter a sine wave.

You can get GB of RAM as that would help load samples into RAM for caching if youre gonna use any highend sampler like kontakt.

Its something I can see myself jamming out to. I like your mixing and mastering waaaaay better than anything Ive ever done. The muffled growls and synths really add to the power of the track. My only real critique is the low end. It sounded a bit heavy on the lower end and the highs felt a bit lonely. However that may have been intentional as the song seems to being going for a a very heavy dark atmosphere.    Great work! ,FL_Studio,dgpbc61,1,t5_2rig0

11793367,0,t3_6868mv,Nice video! Definitely helpful for those who dont know how to do it!However I dont mean for this to sound bad towards you as it obviously is a very highly used method of sidechaining and the video is very clear and informative! But I dunno I just personally feel that this is one of the worst ways to sidechain and yet I see so many videostutorials showing this method and no one questioning it...I just feel that surely itll cause more issues further down the line when it comes to mixing? For example it leaves no way to automate the slider on the mixer for that track as far as I know? as setting the volume is no longer done via the insert slider as the Fruity Peak Controller will always automate it to the base level. I know you can always adjust the base level obviously or set the volume from within the synthsample or via the volume knob in the channel rack or even adding an effect plugin which has a gainvolume knob or by using an insert as a bus but why make it so you have to adjust the volume from somewhere else than the other inserts when the rest of your track is adjustedmixed within the insertsmixer sliders?I just find it to be messier than linking the Kick to the insert you want to duck and using the compressor within Fruity Limiter. I mean not only does it have a built in option for sidechaining it also gives a much better graphical representation than the Peak Controller AND it frees up the insert slider for easy adjustment throughout the production when mixing andor automating?Obviously if Im missing something or Im wrong Im happy to be corrected ha I genuinely mean that too cause Im in no way stating that the way I do it is perfect or the correct way to do it obviously its just personal preference but to me doesnt take any longer to setup and requires the same amount of plugins but you get a better and more consistent setup throughout.Still get an up vote from me cause it is a good video  would just like opinions on why everyone chooses to do it this way!,FL_Studio,dgwtgfk,3,t5_2rig0
