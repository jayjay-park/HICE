137470,0,t1_ceu32s9,You can do what ifs all day dude. Doesnt mean there is any one right way. If you dont want to be a middleman or use one that is entirely your choice. That doesnt mean you can tell other people they are wrong for using one. You can warn them about the implications of using a middleman but that is no different than someone warning others the implications of a trader that hasnt made a single trade and is not willing to use a middleman. Especially when the middlemen on this subreddit are usually the ones that have  transactions without a single hiccup. Plus paypal already looks down upon the selling of digital items and in many times if there are issues with the transaction they will place both accts on probation sometimes even close them both. ,Starcitizen_trades,ceu36a8,2,t5_2xwvq

You see these guys posting rediculously lowball offers to the poor folk who either need the money right now or assume that they need to sell at  to get a bite. The fact of the matter is no one wants RSI that isnt giftable anymore so the few people looking for it are in a haven to give completely disrespectful  offers. You may see people posting offers in those threads but they dont get closed because they dont get completed. People are offering below  and its sickening. If you support what this game and Kickstarters in general are trying to do you would not try to rip off a fellow supporter this badly. They are straight up profiteering though I strongly doubt they realize there is no longer profit to be made. People have long established accounts and arent looking to buy a dummy account with a  RSI balance on it. I would really like to know why these people are trying to aquire so much RSI which is mostly useless at this point.When I used to sell ships before the gifting changes I accepted RSI at  value of USD to make up for fees and still people preferred to use paypal.People just arent selling RSI like they used to and Danmig quite honestly you just werent around to experience the heyday of credit flipping so I dont give your assertion any validity.,Starcitizen_trades,civg2o7,2,t5_2xwvq

1935942,0,t1_ckm8jkd,Hes not overpaying anything if he wants to do a direct trade. Market value means absolutely nothing once the ships are locked to accounts. I couldnt sell an M that is locked to my account and he cant sell a Khartu that is locked to his. The simple fact of the matter is that his ship cost him  and mine cost me  so if he prefers to do a direct trade then that is his business.

A well made ad explaining everything.  But because it is  hours old already people completely ignore it and like the other day when someone put up a fresh ad for the same price they sold  in an hour...  took me  days to sell one without spamming.So in other words the spamming works.In this case I dont mind it so much since Ill hold on to my extras.

These are a true star citizen rarity especially when applied to a super hornet Ben has stated that you wont lose any super hornetness with this kit and you will retain your second seat and its one of the first steps towards a milspec hornet.In the original sale link below its stated that this was never meant for public release if not for that veterans day charity sale which they didnt partner with again this year.,Starcitizen_trades,cn6j74o,-1,t5_2xwvq

2757889,0,t1_cnhjsi5,I had a lot of problems writing this section only because I had to keep in dumbed down no offense! for first time traders. My goal was to make them realize that just because they use a middleman that doesnt mean that the ship they receive or the payment they receive wasnt obtained fraudulently so the ship or payment may disappear if CIG or a chargeback locks the funds.From the perspective of the escrow service there are a lot of intricacies like youve listed that are important for the middler to know but for the person enlisting the service of the middler they dont need to know that  it just makes it confusing and makes things look very risky.I plan on writing a wiki for middlemen to use as a reference for proper practices guidelines and templates but that will be hosted on the other subreddit. I feel that having  wiki entries on all aspects of middlemanery is unnecessary and overly confusing.At its base getting the fact across that using an escrow service increases safety when a new or inexperienced buyer is involved was the goal of the wiki page you cited. Using a middler doesnt completely remove all risks but it removes many of them and until CIG smartens up and gives us the tools to mitigate this the current system is the best weve got.Do you have any suggestion regarding how those two lines could be reworded? ,Starcitizen_trades,cnhk7hu,1,t5_2xwvq

2838603,0,t1_cnppwpq,sorry... but have you read the description when the reclaimer was for sale? I will help you...The Reclaimer is being offered for the first time as a limited concept sale. This means that the ship design meets our specifications but it is not yet ready to display in your Hangar or to fight in Arena Commander. The sale includes Lifetime Insurance on the ship hull and a pair of decorative items for your Hangar. A future patch will add a Reclaimer poster and then once the ingame model is finished you will also be given an ingame Reclaimer ship model! In the future the ship price will increase and the offer will not include Life Time Insurance or these extras.So as I understand it will be much more expensive in future...,Starcitizen_trades,cnqqum0,1,t5_2xwvq

3066471,0,t1_cofu11i,The original allotment was  and there is no data on how many Completionist packages were sold and are still currently being sold though. There could be thousands of LTI Scythes out there for all we know. I do understand that it is all about supply and demand though. It only takes one person willing to pay a ridiculous amount of money before the rest follow suit.I guess im more practical in that I think the Scythes utility is limited in the PU and having it sit in my hangar because taking it out means im an instant target for the entire server would be kind of a waste LTI or no LTI. And then theres the idea that there will be ships that are more rare that can only be obtained in the PU and things like that. But youre right if this is the current high point of ship rarity then it makes sense people will empty bank accounts for it even if the concept is not practical at all to some. Then again this is coming from someone with  LTI ships in their hangar including a Phoenix Carrack Reclaimer Merchantman. To me though at least those ships all have roles and utility. The Scythe to me just brings so little to the table in comparison and pretty much costs as much as the four aforementioned ships combined.,Starcitizen_trades,cofu49a,2,t5_2xwvq

Theyve also been able to adjust the rates on the fly. Lastly as a major partner for Paypal Im sure theyre able to negotiate a better rate than . They could put that into a Euro bank account and have a credit union swap it for under .Ultimately this is their own doing. To complain that a system they installed is being abused but do nothing about for monthsyears is poor form. Instead of flip flopping they should have expedited a proper system from the beginning as soon as the issue was discovered. Dragging their heels means the blame for this issue lies with them. Converting funds is part of business just as credit card fees are. Would you like it if they added a . charge for paying with Stripe? These ships are expensive.

Any larger store should have most of your ships. Take those values and take off  or just look at the front page to see what similar ships are going for. Giving you a valuation on your current account in its entirety is tough.Just list what ships are locked for a proper valuation. Backer bonuses and hangar flair are irrelevant unfortunately.

5722374,0,t3_3tice1,No there is always someone who wont be in a position to get the ship they want during this sale and may resort to the gray market later. Also game packages wont have LTI so there will still be a market for those as well as ships such as the Glaive and Scythe. And lastly BUKs and Modules with LTI will still be on demand. The impact I think will be a smaller mark up for LTI tokens since there will be many more on the market and maybe not many sales on this Reddit for the next couple of months.,Starcitizen_trades,cx6f13q,3,t5_2xwvq

There were many weeks where one could be had for .They only started to rise in price a few months later and generally settled around . After March of  when the revised AMD packages started showing up you could get deals for one for  since they no longer included SQ.Now just due to the Omega AMDs lesscommon nature nonSQ packages go for around  and SQ packages should realy be going for at least . Again if you wait until February or later to sell when SQ is a separate package...you can probably get a minimum of  for it then. The reason you dont get that much even if it has an upgrade value of  is because it melts for . That makes it worthwhile only if someone isnt paying the full  for it realistically since right now a full package up until January st sells for  with many sellers offering an Anniversary starter in some cases for .,Starcitizen_trades,cyk2b8k,2,t5_2xwvq

6593486,0,t3_45za58,Personal choice really. Stores have rolling stock so its not always optimal to list wts a b c d e f g h i g etc. in a title when a permanent store will better serve as a constant menu for listing all your trades. The store tag also gives you a permanent entry in the search filterAs a rule of thumb which isnt a rule Id say whenever youve got multiples of ships or more items than you can comfortably fit in the title bar its time for a store. If youd like you can also apply for a broker tag if that applies to you as in you are selling for others as well.Generally stores have a pretty good reputation for quick service and good selection so personally I think its preferable to use a store tag if youre on the fence as it may attract newer buyers who would feel more comfortable buying from a high volume trader.,Starcitizen_trades,d01bjwt,3,t5_2xwvq

8176699,0,t1_d4zmqrm,personally I am hoping the admins step in and just blanket ban the accounts. There is an old saying I live by  wrongs dont make a right.....

8176835,0,t1_d4zmy75,gt Though when they stop now I am the guilty party gaming the system up .... its a slippery slopeI have the opposite view. Trying to force the admins to change the default view to new is subverting the purpose of reddit since voting is core to the identity of reddit.A more redditlike solution would be for the community to band together in solidarity to drown the voice of manipulators. If you dont like how the frontpage looks change it. Counter upvoting counter downvoting. Anything. Really.  Were all on a equal playing field. Thats the point of a free market competition.If the manipulators are not using bots than they are redditing correctly and its my bad for incorrectly connoting that they are manipulators. If they are using bots then they know the risk and could get suspended sitewide by the admins if caught.   ,Starcitizen_trades,d4znk6r,1,t5_2xwvq

8755062,0,t3_4zz9bm,Youre also virtually guaranteed to have the Super Hornet offered again during the anniversary sale seriously the thing is always going up for sale. So unless you desperately want to fly it between now and then...maybe pick up some RSI credit here   and use it to purchase the upgrade come Anniversary time.Remember though purchasing credit or ships through the grey market will not contribute to your backer title status on the RSI website.

9527076,0,t3_5bbjdy,I read an article a while back that was talking about the Nigerian prince scam. Essentially the text was full of errors on purpose to filter out the brightest. When someone responded they would have a much higher likelihood to succeed with the scam as these errors didnt raise the red flags as they should have. On here with many traders around I will guess that the idea is to make the potential buyer feel like they are dealing with a simple less educated person which in turn would encourage the buyer to move fast before someone else takes notice.,Starcitizen_trades,d9newck,4,t5_2xwvq
