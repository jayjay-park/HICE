4045753,0,t1_crh573f,gtand the twist that makes it all hang together actually makes senseBut thats the thing there was no twist on which everything hangs in Lost. It was never meant to be that type of show. Lots of people were expecting the show to be all about a twist but the closest it ever came to that was the flashsideways universe reveal but the flashsideways universe was introduced in the show back in Season  so it was a longstanding part of the shows mythology not something that just came out of nowhere.Lost didnt need to be purgatory to have somewhere to go. It was always about the characters dealing with their personal journies and how the events on the island shaped those journies. You dont need a purgatory twist or any twist for any of that.,WaywardPines,crhg2ni,1,t5_2xdsh

His family was captured days after him but brought to the same day he came to the town. Would also explain why Kates been there for  years though only captured  weeks ago.

Presumably major money tech capabilities behind whoeverwhatever is at the top of the WP puppet strings. Having the mindshaping be so important and these two heavy in the mix makes sense. It seems like the Mayor has regretted something thats happened along the way and is trying to help Ethan. Also his file said in former life he had son and daughter. Thinking Bens new friend is the daughter spymindshaping buddy and maybe something happened with the son to cause the Mayor to warn Ethan about the focus on kids.Someone brought up the choice of drinks earlier and I noticed it odd as well. At the main table Ethan Theresa and the Mayor are all drinking red wine. The hypnotizer is drinking a cocktail as is Pam seen in toast. Seems coincidental the two main baddies in this scene arent sippin the same koolaid as everyone else. Maybe just paired better with the Buffalo...,WaywardPines,crx84mh,5,t5_2xdsh

Popular because they were on the lower end of the spectrum so that the lower half of readers wouldnt feel intimidated.  Popular because they got shoved into the spotlight for having those th grade reading level books with lots of military nods with bullets and monsters and blah blah.  Add the Twin Peaks styled parts and youve got less than one slice of the cake.  It isnt about the weird.  It isnt about the mystery.  Its  filler. And now I feel very sad that Im wandering back to my reading spot to start the second book.  I fucking hate this thing now.  Why am I reading it?  I know its bad.  I KNOW ITS BAD.

4347438,0,t3_3aph60,The series is a trilogy and this big twist and reveal was at the end of the first book Pines. Its quite a shock and you dont see it coming in the book but the truth at its core is the truth. Both the time lapse and the cryogenic freezing is proven to the reader beyond doubt by way of the fact that WARNING EXTENSIVE BOOK SPOILER Sheriff Arnold Pope who is still alive calls a reckoning for Ethan Burke during his attempted escape with Beverly who is caught. He watches her get killed and continues to run. This happens early on in the show but it is at the end of first book.spoiler  In the book Theresa and Ben are abducted from their home by Dr. Pilcher himself and havent been shown since that moment. During the reckoning Theresa is revealed to have been in the town for sometime and is watching the town hunt Ethan from her window.  She prays that Ben wont wake up and go out to see the commotion and join in. She watches Ethan run and reminisces on how difficult integration was for him. She tries to make peace with the fact that he will be dead by morning and that she can never acknowledge their shared past life.spoiler  Ethan escapes the townies through the woods and across a river by scaling the cliffs only to be chased by  abbies. He kills and escapes the abbies by climbing even higher up the cliff towards a shiny metal box which he discovers is a large exhaust vent. He enters and climbs down the vent and finds himself in massive  million sq. ft. warehouse filled with cars. He notices a car that looks like Theresas it is covered with dust and climbs in and sees their stuff. He realizes that TheresaBen must be here too. He dodges people and runs into the a room filled with cryochambers. He goes through various chambers revealing things about other characters and finds his name. It reads Ethan Burke DOB and Date Frozen rd integration attempt termination in progress. His mind is blown and just then Dr. Pilcher and co. walk in. Ethan realizes now that the psychiatrist is running the show.spoiler  Pilcher tells Ethan to come with him and he will explain. He takes Ethan Pam and Pope on a helicopter ride to this overgrown jungle wasteland and Ethan asks where they are? He replies Boise Idaho. Ethan is shattered. He asks Ethan what he wants and Ethan says he wants his family. Dr. Pilcher says he can have them and reveals Theresa and Ben unconscious in the back of the helicopter. He offers Ethan a choice A pack of provisions and food for him and his family that they can use to survive out here alone or to come back and be a part of the team to help him root out an uprising against him. Ethan decides to go back. Just then a herd of abbies start attacking. In the shootout everyone makes it back to the helicopter except Sheriff Pope. Dr. Pilcher deliberately leaves him behind to be eaten stating that Pope was trying to lead and get more power and that they dont need his services any longer. He immediately offers Ethan the job.spoiler The book ends with Ethan reunited with his family in a nice home. Theresa is cooking and Ben is a few years older then when he last saw him in Seattle He was  years old. Everyone acts like nothing is out of the ordinary as Ethan prepares to start his first day of work as the Sheriff.spoilerAs the major reveal is at the end of the book it has far more impact. Makes you want to read the next book. Since this series includes the entire trilogy its impossible to give it the same impact as the reveal has to be in the middle.  The second book Wayward begins pretty much with episode . A lot of stuff is out of order due to the fact that Sheriff Pope and BenTheresas storyline were massively changed with regards to the first book. Thus some elements of Wayward are in first  episodes and the way things have played out on the show I feel it made the reveal far less dramatic. However the storyline changes do leave room for a reimagining of a character yettobeintroduced. There is a lot of potential with this character and a  storyline unencumbered by Theresas original book arc allows for the possibility of taking the show in another perhaps more fulfilling direction.  ,WaywardPines,csfosjl,3,t5_2xdsh

4478682,0,t1_csv79wf,gt If they wanted us to think it was a lie and theyre still in  they would not show the flashbacks to viewers but show the conversation between them.Unless Ethan was drugged with something to make his hallucinations worse so when Pilcher told the stories he literally saw them in his mind and thus believed them more than he would have otherwise.The thing is the writers dont want you to think its a lie because Ethan doesnt think it is yet.

I honestly wonder if he ever really cared about saving humanity or just saw this as a chance to finally be somebody important that people would look up to and worship. Having a small army of sycophantic devotees people who needed a second chance as he put it lonely down on their luck probably a lot of submissive codependent types willing to follow him into the gates of Hell probably didnt hurt his ego either.WP is no more than a giant ant farm to him.,WaywardPines,csy5a4z,8,t5_2xdsh

4641355,0,t1_ctffesd,Surely science fiction isnt about being scientifically accurate its about envisaging a selfconsistent world works on its own terms without invoking magic  to explore something about our world today? Its a what if exercise.Id say none of those examples has really good science except perhaps  and even then shortcuts are made and there is a fantasy element.  In each case they work by having you focus and commit to one part of the story and you let the rest slide. Because thats the thing they are about a story in their world and you must take the world as fact and proceed from there. Each film or series has its own science not the science.  If we held up everything to the science it would be no fun. Stupid events that break the rules the world has set up  though thats different.On those examples Interstellar  the gravitational anomalies dimensional space planet ecology are all nonsense. OK because the film actually about human relationships and the pioneer spirit. Ex Machina  the nature of consciousness is completely misrepresented handwaving technology explanations that are meaningless. OK because it is about empathy power and manipulation. Chappie  the nature of consciousness is completely misrepresented handwaving technology explanations that are meaningless. OK because it is about childhood ignorance corruption and racism.   this ones fairly decent actually except Bowman holds his breath before launching into the air lock and the Discovery doesnt have extended panels. OK because it is about the nature of existence nonhuman intelligence. Star Trek  Space fantasy thats not how space works. OK because its about moral choices when confronted with the unknown. Doctor Who  Time fantasy thats now how time works. OK because its about a fascinating character going on unlimited adventures. Black Mirror  Generally pretty grounded as a  minutes into the future concept depending on the episode although obviously White Christmas etc are nonsense really. Its basically a modern Twilight Zone. OK because its really satire about the social and political trends of today.Id say only  stacks up in the actual science department and  Black Mirror gets a pass sometimes.  In terms of their own worlds they all work fine. I think Wayward Pines works okay in that way too.Is the problem that Wayward Pines explicitly references a timescale so everyone can compare today to the  of the series? Surely we should just accept like we do for Humans and actually for any other everyday show that its a sort of parallel world. Maybe it should be called science fantasy rather than science fiction and all the arguments would stop because anything not set in the actual present  day world is basically fantasy.TLDR Its about creating an fictional version of the world in order to explore other topics or just have fun with ideas. It doesnt have to match this worlds science it just has to be consistent within its own world.EDIT This Slate article is quite good about being factual vs what the film  or show is actually about.EDIT Check out the World Science Festivals Cinema Peer Review section if you want to ruin films for yourself based on their scientific content.,WaywardPines,ctfly18,-1,t5_2xdsh
