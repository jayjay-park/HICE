6121827,0,t1_cyih8ey,When you buy an iOS device you legally own the hardware but not the software. Apple owns it. And it is illegal to use someone elses code to modify software. This is what whitedr does. SnwbreezeiFaithredsnw dont use Apples code. They were built from the ground up. Yes they use SHSHIPSWs but they dont modify the code inside them. And an IPSW isnt iOS until it is loaded and installed in a device. So they are legal.,LegacyJailbreak,cylhkws,0,t5_352su
