Youll need at least a B average for your credits to transfer over and the higher your grades the more competitive youll be.Also if your intended major is offered at NYUSPS School of Professional Studies it might be worth considering applying there  specifically the Paul McGhee Division.

Engineering is a much broader field than CS and the CAS program is entirely different from that at Poly because its more theoretical vs. applied. Im a bit confused about your financial argument. NYU did not buy Poly to say this conveys a very limited understanding of how the merger worked.

3596506,0,t3_31bch6,Congrats for getting into the BFA!I just transferred into Game Design this semester after being in GLS for a year and a half and it has been the greatest experience so far. I never imagined Id be so happy. There are only about  of us right now since its only internal transfers so its great to hear about hopefully incoming freshmen! I hadnt taken any of the classes before this semester and pretty much dove right in and am taking three games classes and an nonrelated elective. Ive always wanted to make games but never had any idea as to how that was done. Games  does a really good job on the history of games and teaching you about the various genres. Im also taking Intro to Game Design and Intermediate Game Development. Design is more about physical games board card social etc. Its mostly group based and you make a different kind of game every few weeks and present it to the class. Its very challenging but a lot of fun even if you dont plan on making physical games in the long run. Its a lot of really useful knowledge. In Game Dev also called Game Modding or something along those lines for people out the major I believe were mostly modding HalfLife  using the Source Engine learning how to do scripting making textures in Photoshop and lots of really interesting stuff. It also has various group based projects.One of the biggest things about the BFA is that most of the classes are all about working with others which isnt something I thought of before getting into the programclasses. Im not saying its a bad thing and it makes sense seeing as games are made by teamscompanieswhatever but its not like most other classes where youll do group work towards the end of the semester. From week one youll be in groups working on games and prototypes and you have to be very flexible with your schedule. Ive probably spent at least  hours outside of class working on the various projects with my groups for Game Design. The classes are a lot of work but its really fun work.The professors really know what theyre doing and do all they can to help out students with their own projects classwork etc. The Poly campus can be a little annoying to get to but its worth it. It definitely seems like the mindset at the Game Center leans towards building up new indies as opposed to training students for AAAs but its not as if the stuff youll learn wont apply. There are always a lot of MFAs around working on their own projects so its pretty cool to see what people are coming up with. Events are held...almost every week I think? Theyre pretty often. They range from talks on breaking into the games industry writing for games gamblingcasino games etc. Theyre all very interesting and worth going to.Im pretty sure the MFABFA have been around for a while and so has the Game Center so NYU has a lot of great connections in terms of Game Design and its shaping up to be a very good program. The classes have been around for a while but as another commenter said this is just the first time theyre offering them all together as a BFA.

Now that its a part of NYU its brand is event stronger.Courant is one of the best institutes in the world for applied mathematics and fluid dynamics any degree from them is going to be well respected.

I think this is pretty similar to saying reputation matters more in international rankings which apparently NYU shouldnt have since there are better schools according to the domestic rankings.Rather than benefit I would say NYU deserves the recognition they get and it leads to a positive feedback improving NYU academically. ,nyu,d0g5i7a,-1,t5_2rbpf
