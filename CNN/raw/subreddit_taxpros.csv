1361353,0,t3_29o66j,I like the idea of this Sub but I can see folks wandering in here to ask questions about their W and other mundane stuff that tends to proliferate in rtax.  I dont think that you want to be spend time modding this sub to keep the spammers and folks out who dont bother to read the sidebar so Id be looking to make it a private sub but perhaps with a low threshold for admission.The other way to do it may be to invite people based on their activity in rtax andor raccounting.  I tend to see the same  people responding to questions in those subs and if we see that theyre at least giving competent responses they could be invited to join the cool folks in here.,taxpros,cimxolc,4,t5_32eja
3027063,0,t1_co5zqpb,This is what we decided to go with as well. Any return with RampM or supplies is getting the de minimus election tacked on.     Had CPE saying the same thing consulted with our shareholder and with another CPA who owns a firm in our region and theyre all coming to this same conclusion.,taxpros,cobr4d0,1,t5_32eja

6413405,0,t1_czimwsu,Yep its a good idea to get away from self employment tax until all the other factors come into play. Corporate tax in foreign country with no FTC ordinary income in U.S. on net income of all services contracts lost foreign earned income exclusion pretty bad tax answer...subpart F can be a bitch.Edit FTC comment,taxpros,czin0vu,1,t5_32eja

All he said was that its a partnership for tax purposes which means it could be a bunch of different things for state law purposes including nothing a general partnership a limited partnership a limited liability partnership a limited liability limited partnership and a limited liability company.Bottom line is OP needs to do some readingthis is too complicated of an area to summarize here.  Start with Code section  and the regs and go from there.,taxpros,czyj3x8,3,t5_32eja

6854687,0,t3_49nk6o,Ok so... Heres my thoughtsEven though I agree its your job to just do a return dont you think its shortsighted to just not care about her benefits? I mean it isnt your job to know but you could at least have said to her  good point I do not know how this will affect your benefits. Im happy to change it if you find out thats a better answer. No need to just shrug her off like that...Also I believe you can make an s election up to March  the year following the start of the biz no? Could be wrong about that but Im pretty sure Ive seen it done....,taxpros,d0tacab,6,t5_32eja

7787957,0,t3_4lwoea,The treatment of these for GAAP book and Tax are entirely different. Under GAAP these would be sales and purchases of new assets and there arent luxury auto depreciation limits. Under tax there is some flexibility to if this was a sale I tend to lean towards yes or a nontaxable like kind exchange I tend to lean towards no perhaps Im too conservative.Because your terminology here is a little flawed Im a bit confused about what youre asking. But yes in a like kind exchange tax basis transfers and is increased by the boot cash in general. ,taxpros,d3rf8nb,1,t5_32eja
7946911,0,t3_4o165h,In LBampI should be the same for SBSE Appeals handles Fast Track so really its just getting two bites at the Appeals apple. Doubt that the Appeals person who handled the FTS was colluding with Exam abut results ahead of time thats exparte and a big nono. They would only know about unagreed issues as part of the FTS package.When I was in LBampI Exam we couldnt stand Fast Track  all taxpayers wanted to do is test the waters without going fullblown appeals. If they didnt like the result they would say forget it and go to Appeals bring in the rep firms controversy folks to drag it out longer and probably go outside the chain of management to exert additional pressure to concede issues.  Why not go to the regular appeals route after? Time considerations?,taxpros,d49b2wo,1,t5_32eja
10564900,0,t3_5rabou,gtMy advice would be to amend and previous returns to take those deductions that they can substantiate in the year the expenses were paid just like any other incomeexpenses paid in previous years.Thats the correct course of action. gt So are there any special royalty rules that I am forgetting or not aware of?No assuming they are a cash basis tax payer. If they wanted to adjust the timing of the deductions they should have paid all the expenses in the same tax year. ,taxpros,dd5ng0e,2,t5_32eja
