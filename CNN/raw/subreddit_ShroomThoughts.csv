7289170,0,t1_d26pzz4,Thats what I was thinking it shows up when black lines and white lines get super close together. Its pretty amazing I think. And yeah I think itll come down to AI too but Im not worried because I always thank my machines or electronic devices after I use them. I figured might as well start now so they know Im not a dick. My bio on that Twitter used to be thank your machines but I changed it because I thought the idea of them being your machines isnt true because they arent mine they are their own thing. Edit and thanks for the reply and comfort hahaAlso are you interested in elaborating on why feel youre still tripping on shrooms. I did them a few years ago and had a pretty intense panic attack I dont normally get panic attacks but in hindsight its because Im a control freak ha but ever since then I feel a little stuck in my head. Sometimes Im able to snap back into it but its weird. Im not sad about it just curious about what other peoples experiences are like perception wise.,ShroomThoughts,d26q9x2,2,t5_3e8kr
