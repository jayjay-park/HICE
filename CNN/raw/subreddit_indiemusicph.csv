10448516,0,t1_dcsf98e,Chyrho was already prepping to make his solo album along with Six the Northstar when they happened to catch Ninno performing at Cubao Expo. Impressed Chyrho started talking to Ninno found out that Ninno grew up listening to Chyrho and his old label AMPON. Fast friends they decided to try working on something different together along with Six the Northstar a departure from their superserious personas a nerdcore rap group called Shadow Moses. They called me after writing their first few songs to help them stay on top of things and weve been going it together ever since. Honestly I know next to nothing about rap and I almost said no until I met with them and listened to the music they were making. Its been a wild ride so far and I cant say I regret my choice. ,indiemusicph,dcsfjpv,2,t5_3ewwm
