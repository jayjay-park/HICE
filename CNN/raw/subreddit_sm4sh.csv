2743920,0,t1_cnfyjof,gt well balanced roster BETWEEN THE TOP Hahahahahahahaah. Okay tell that to yourself to help you sleep at night.gt HE Meta Knight HAS HIS OWN TIER AT THE TOP.The difference between Brawls  best character and  best character is smaller than the difference between Melees  best character  best character. Thats how fucking absurd the balance is in Melee. It doesnt matter that Meta Knight has his own tier if the tiers are minuscule.Sit two pros down who have both played Melee and Brawl competitively. Have them play two  stock matches. One on melee Bowser vs Fox and one on brawl Bowser vs Meta Knight. I guarantee you that the melee game will be fucking landslide compared to the brawl game. We would be lucky if the melee bowser even got  kills because melee fox is a fucking god compared to melee bowser.gt every single tiny input you do in Melee requires immense thoughtMy fucking sides. Lmao.gt neutral game involves getting a grab and dthrowing into up airGood luck playing SSB competitively where all you try and do is grab as your only approach. Maybe that is why you suck so much ass and try to shit on the game? Because you keep repeating the same nonsense that there is no baiting and well spaced aerials in brawlssb? Try not being a shitter for a second.Your logic is so fucking stupid. Heres another example Smash  simply isnt as fast becuase obviously faster  more skill right? Lets just take every game and make it run twice as fast to require more skill!!! HURRR!God damn you are a fucking hardcore fanboy who cant even see the faults in the game you are jerking off.

3257942,0,t1_coz1obo,gtWhen people roll too often  it makes it easier because they essentially have five spots where theyre gonna stand on an omega stage.Usually they arent rolling constantly from one side to another but rolling away from you. Which is bloody annoying when youre using a meleeonly character that doesnt have an insane reach like Shulk and have to use mind games and try to bait them.gtI spam projectiles at safe distances but because Ive been playing Toon LinkMega Man.Nothing wrong if people use projectiles for things like zoning and pressuring their opponents into shield so they can easily grab them which works really good with Megamans ftilt.However if they only spam attack using pretty much nothing but projectiles and keep running away from opponents so they can keep attacking at long range and avoid any and all direct confrontation with their opponents theyre the scum of For Glory mode in my opinion.Its just tedious and plain unfun to play against those kinds of people it doesnt give you a thrill like when youre playing a super close match and winning! against someone whos really good theres only frustration.,sm4sh,cozp3l5,3,t5_31zbe

3412046,0,t3_2z7e7x,Theyre incredibly strong combo players and good grabgame esp Mario. That would be pretty strong against Ganon although Kirby should be able to avoid a lot of the combos because hes so small and light.Many of their moves also come out fast like the Dsmash or come out fast and have amazing priority Nairs. Though comparison is something likeMario Very fast movement and Fair is a powerful spike.Dr. Mario Slower running speed and just generally hits harder and combos less than Mario.Luigi Several moves pop you up or set up another attack so he has all the combos in the world. His lack of traction and air movement can make him rather hard to predict. He has slow air speed and cant fastfall very well though so those are important weaknesses to keep in mind.,sm4sh,cph75bn,2,t5_31zbe

5923874,0,t1_cxw51ak,Im a Ness main but boy do I aspire to be a Ryu main. I think it really starts with his combo game. All of Ryus combos are so very hard to pull off but all extremely rewarding. You have to know what would work in each situation and Ryu majority of the time has a one if not many options for it. Next comes his Focus Attack which can create some serious pressure for opponents. Its also great for mind games as well. Finally the strengths of Ryus attacks. The varying nature in terms of strength for each attack makes every single situation unique and great Ryu players know how to use this well. The thing is Ryu isnt as user friendly as many of the other top tier characters which is why I think it will take years before we see him played to his full potential.HungryBox put this post up similarly agreeing with me. If you look through this thread you can see examples of what I am talking about.Years down the line and this is a long shot I think Ryu will be to Smsh what Fox is to Melee.,sm4sh,cxw5g9k,2,t5_31zbe
