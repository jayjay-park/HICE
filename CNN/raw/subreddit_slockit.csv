7034247,0,t1_d1doh4w,I decided to just paste it here... Please forgive the formatting... it is easier to read on the PDF Especially the equations Reward TokensIn this section we give a description of how reward tokens are implemented in this contract. Much of the information has already been explained but it is restated here for clarity.Reward tokens are used to divide the ether sent to rewardAccount amongst the various DAOs that own reward tokens. Reward tokens are only transferred in the event of a DAO split they can never be owned by anything other than the original DAO or a fork of the original DAO that generated the reward tokens.Reward tokens are generated when the DAO makes any transaction spending ether with the exception of sending ether to the rewardAccount. When the DAOs products send ether back to the DAO for example when a Slock sends  of a transaction to the DAO the ether is held with the rest of the ether that the DAO has but rewards counts all the ether which has been received as rewards.The DAO can use these rewards to fund new proposals or to equally distribute the rewards to the reward token holders using a proposal which gets voted on by the DAO token holders. Then the token holders of the DAOs that hold reward tokens will be able to claim the ether they have earned for their contribution to the original DAO that issued the reward token. To do this the DAO will send the accumulated rewards to the rewardAccount which is held in the ManagedAccount contract. Then and only then will the token holders of the DAOs that hold reward tokens be able to call the getMyReward function and receive their ether. These payouts are tracked by the map paidOut which keeps track of which DAOs hold reward tokens and whether they have claimed their portion of the rewards and which of the original DAO token holders have claimed their fair portion of the rewards.This process guarantees that any DAO token holder whose ether was spent building a product will receive the rewards promised to them from that product even if they decide to split from the DAO.SplitIn this section we want to formally describe some parameters and their behavior during a split.The total amount of DAO tokens totalSupply is de fined as follows  Ttotal   X i TiWhere Ti is the amount of DAO tokens owned by an address i balancesi. Note that  is the total number of possible addresses in Ethereum. Similarly the amount of reward tokens Rtotal is defined as follows Rtotal   X i Ri  numP roposals X pp.proposalP assedtrue p.amountFor every passed proposal that sends ether out of the DAO an amount of reward tokens equal to the amount being spent in wei is created.Lets assume that during the split a fraction of DAO tokens X changes service providers and leaves the DAO. The new DAO created receives X  DAO pre a portion of the remaining ether from the original DAO. DAO post    X  DAO preHere DAO pre is the ether balance of the original DAO before the split and DAO post is the ether balance of the original DAO after the split.A portion of the reward tokens is transferred to the new DAO in a very similar manner RDAO post    X  RDAO preHere RDAO is the amount of reward tokens owned by the DAO prior to the first split  of all rewards tokens ever created are owned by the DAO. RnewDAO  X  RDAO preThe number of reward tokens owned by the new DAO are denoted by RnewDAO. The total amount of reward tokens Rtotal stays constant during the split no reward tokens are ever destroyed.The original DAO tokens of the accounts that con firmed the new service provider are destroyed. Hence Ttotal post    X  Ttotal preThis process allows DAO token holders to retrieve their ether from the DAO at any time without losing out on any of the future rewards they are entitled to receive even if they choose to leave the DAO.,slockit,d1dor4a,1,t5_3ak33

7147057,0,t1_d1qiz60,gtWhat would prevent replacing the storage device with a very little script that would output the exact same values?You can only know the values if you own the bar.   The slock.it device must have an unaccesible private key to sign its output. gtWhat would stop an amateur custodian from running away with the gold after it has redeemed the certificate?The very same reasons than an institutional custodiangtHow will you handle audits if custodians are all over the place and thousand of miles appart?Thats why I propose the slock.it device.,slockit,d1qjo91,1,t5_3ak33
7568323,0,t1_d32ha44,Yes but... the problem is that as a contractor you must ask for the whole sum ahead of time that will then be disbursed over time. And since the DAO can only speak ETH youre vulnerable to the volatility no matter how you look at it. So having dgd or any stable coin would be great but right now the DAO code doesnt support it. This is why iterations towards a . model is so important in the long term. ,slockit,d32hcb7,0,t5_3ak33
