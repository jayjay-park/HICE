6439805,0,t3_43sll6,hahahaha loved your video! Very funny. Sadly I dont have a ps  The last Godzilla game I had was on the Wii. I really really wish Xbox would make a game using the Kinect so I could swing my arms around and stomp on buildings myself. Thanks for the hilarious review. Well done!,kaiju,czlexmv,1,t5_2rmmo
