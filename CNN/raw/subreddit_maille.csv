719342,0,t3_22eau6,Indeed one isnt particularly likely to sell patches of Euro  without an inlay design or some good marketing cough pan scrubbers cough. If you know youre going to be dealing with rings of various unknown sizes it might be worth it to pick up a cheap set of calipers to measure it out. Knowing the size of your rings is more than a little handy. Getting deeper in though youll usually be dealing with suppliers who have already measured the ring sizes and have it listed.Inlay designs are best done through the illustrious Irregular Grid Painter in combination with an image editor of your choice. Seriously MSPaint will even work. Mostly.Finally pricing is a vicious beast by itself.  cents a ring might be manageable for very large works particularly for inlays and such like that. However these are the sizes of pieces that youll find dont sell very often due to cost especially pieces in the quickly attained  range. Some weaves are also significantly more timeconsuming than others and thus will be more expensive in labour.For smaller pieces you may want to consider going a little higher or at least rounding up to the nearest  or . The best pieces are creative look like a lot of work and are still not very expensive.The selling part is certainly something that you may find yourself struggling with. Your best bet is to work on getting a moderate repertoire of weaves and items before looking into doing craft shows and the like.,maille,cgm1jps,2,t5_2sdan
1317385,0,t3_29361g,If you can base a ring cutting design around a variable speed lathedrill as different metals are best cut at different blade rpm.  I made an adjustable cutting block that attaches to the xy stage on my lathe and it works like a charm.,maille,cihtmmw,1,t5_2sdan

2028733,0,t3_2hyw47,The teacher in me has to mention. Mail patterns often require specific gauges and sizes of the rings used. The tension required to keep the weave locked in its proper position is the reason for it this bracelet looks like it was done with too thin a guage ring so its sitting however it wants instead of sitting like the elfweave should. If thats how you like it awesome but since no one else had mentioned this and you new I thought I should in case you didnt know. ,maille,ckxp2d9,1,t5_2sdan

5900129,0,t1_cxt0xb7,Smaller AR smaller number means tighter stronger rings. AR is stronger than AR but you can fit more rings and have more flexible weaves with a higher number. Smaller ga means thicker wire g being thicker than g being thicker than g.So you were working with ga  ID Aluminum? How light is your shirt? Thats AR . by the way. You can use that knowledge to determine how much tighter gaps you want to make your new shirt. Remember that tighter gaps mean less flexibility.,maille,cxt1gvm,2,t5_2sdan

7125086,0,t3_4bx6i7,I started with g  and byzantine bracelets. I loved it!  I could see results right away it gave me great practice on opening and closing rings its a very simple weave and it was really easy to work on in small doses. My first foray into the world of bigger things was a scale maille purse.  I wouldnt recommend that for a starter to anyone as it was the biggest pain in the ass.  However for christmas I made a few cast iron skillet scrubbers a big square of European in out of stainless steel rings with a keychain split ring for a hanging handle.  That was pretty easy gave me a good feeling of accomplishment especially since those things are AWESOME and are not complex  no expanding or contracting. Now that I think of it I seem to make a lot of stuff with g   I never noticed that before.  I may have to start playing with the g  to see what Im missing!

9255028,0,t1_d8ozbgq,I definitely see what youre getting at and I really like that video too.So the shirt is for a character in a game that is basically an undead knight who mindlessly guards and patrols his post hundreds of years after his death.  He has kept his armor from when he was still alive so it wouldnt have been repaired or kept up in the slightest.  In game his maille shirt is ripped torn and triangular on the bottom like I described.  Im not sure whether I would like to stay true to the games image or try for something more realistic.I think the story that I am going with is that the rings from the free hanging lower half of his shirt aged rusted and eventually broke away one by one.  Maybe a ring halfway up crumbled to dust making the ones around it under slightly more stressed causing them to break sooner and so on and so on.  ,maille,d8p53ok,5,t5_2sdan

10877402,0,t3_5sxat4,For the inlay check out a program called Irregular grid painter it is by no means a complete compendium of all the weaves but it is a.. I think the only program out there that does inlays. For tutorials forums galleries and a bunch of other stuff maille check out this site if you havent already. As far as templates go I have no idea there Ive never used one. I just look at how its made and then go from there till I get the right size. If you can find some reference pictures of what you want it to look like it will make it easier to see what kind of seamspattern youre going to need to look into.  As an afterthought I imagine if you wanted a template you could most likely use sewing templates for some of the more basic stuff. Those things are pretty cheap and maille is essentially a fabric. Or make a paper template of your own with pattern paper.. or wax paper or whatever kind of paper works. I hope that helps.
