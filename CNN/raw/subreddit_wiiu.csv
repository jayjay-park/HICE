2183,0,t1_ceeomzt,gt Well a desensitized child will grow up to be a degenerate adult.And this is the big assumption I was expecting. Can I see evidence of the causation you suggest with this claim? Or even proof of correlation? Providing a more specific definition of degenerate wouldnt hurt.gt  I didnt know that writing slut in that context was hurtful but hey theres desensitization for you. Ill edit it to sex or somethingYes. Listing sluts in a list of bad things like cynicism ultraviolence and DLC is an unfavorable context. Whether or not you believe slutty behavior is to be condemned its not really furthering your argument to editorialize in that way since such language tends to make people stop listening and start accusing  Im guilty of this too in the way that I originally responded to your word choice.,wiiu,ceeoqj3,2,t5_2sjnz

10121,0,t1_cefkr42,Thanks!Pokemon Rumble U is an overall step backward for the series unless you buy the NFC figurines.  I dont necessarily regret the purchase but Im not proud of it.  Kind of fun with  people who are just looking to waste some time.CastleStorm is amazing!  Ive really only dabbled in the single player so far but there tons of units spells and projectiles to have fun with.  You get money for each mission you beat and can upgrade you weapons soldiers and castle.  If you dont like the default castles you can use an editor to build your own custom stronghold.  You also get a rank for each level so theres been a lot of replayability for me trying to get  stars on each level.  You get  stars for accuracy  for difficulty easy gives  normal gives  and hard gives  and then  for achieving some special objective in each level like dont let any of your castle rooms get destroyed or get  headshots.  Im pretty close to getting  stars in each level now and have played a bit over  hours.  ,wiiu,cefl5kk,3,t5_2sjnz

The game is developed in Unity so porting it over to the Wii U would probably not take too long leaving us plenty of time to take advantage of the Wii Us hardware. We even have ideas for a few gameplay modes that would take advantage of the GamePad.

Right now Id wager there is no more competitive time im gaming. Tons of PC titles coming console titles etc.Nintendo is still far behind the curve. And I even have  faith that they can make the new Smash Bros playable online. If you were lucky Brawl was playable with  out of  people you played with. But even then a little bit of lag ruins Smash.I feel like by the end of  people will just be waiting again and this time they wont have much to look forward to.Especially considering the PSXB are going to ramp up with good games right as the WiiU is hitting its dry state again postMario Kart and postSmash release hype.

142342,0,t3_1vobtu,I think Wind Waker HD has near perfect Zelda controls. Having the inventory and map on the GamePad is great and once you get used to it the motion controls for aiming is brilliant. Its not the best for precise aiming but its great for quickly selecting the Grappling HookHookshot aiming at a target and firing. One thing it should have is a much bigger maps function with the ability to browse different maps from any area as well as being able to add notes to any maps there will also be a menu where you can look at all your notes and tap it to show where it is on the map. As this can be done easily the game should have some more cryptic puzzles where using it is vital. They could also use the GamePad for puzzles. One idea Ive had for one is where the GamePad has a top down view of the area with loads of movable blocks. These blocks are moved on the GamePad while you still have to navigate through them as Link and make sure you dont squash yourself. ,wiiu,ceun5rf,1,t5_2sjnz

155776,0,t1_cew5pmj,Dont worry the game is very forgiving. If you die you will simply use a continue and pick off from where you died. You do not lose any progress even monster health remains unchanged. This simply means that the battles are longer for the newbies. And remember the more you play the more you learn!However there is a scorebased penalty for taking damage dying and using continues. If you use a lot of continues you will receive a consolation prize. But this doesnt matter if you just want to enjoy the games story.I completed the game with good scores and I hadnt even heard of taunting. It just shows the depth of this game. You can smash your way through or you can master the combat...and anything from between!This is truly the best game on Wii U!,wiiu,cew6ad4,3,t5_2sjnz

184700,0,t1_cezeyz6,Yeah but the features werent meant to be exclusive to the Wii U. I imagine you could do the plex media stuff on the other consoles too...just not as well and without Off TV play.The Wii U alone offers similar experiences that another tablet TV or a handheld would. Obviously if you already have them these arent interesting. However if you dont you get all of them for the price of one. It is like with phones and cameras...if you can take a decent photo with your phone you dont buy a camera just for that. But if you already have a camera that feature propably doesnt interest you as much.Similarly it feels a bit excessive to buy another TV just for those moments when we happen to want to use the TV at the same time. It is simply more sensible to use the Wii Us Off TV play instead. Aside from that I mainly use Off TV play while I am traveling and when I am visiting my family. It wouldnt make sense for them to buy a TV just for my visits either. I agree with you on the games you listed though Wii Sports Club Golf and New Super Mario Bros. U are the exceptions from your list in my opinion. If you dont use Off TV play or check something from the Internet while playing the GamePad doesnt add anything. But even though you wouldnt have use for the GamePad normally I would still appreciate having it for those unusual situations like traveling or visits. I also agree that it is hard to convince someone at the moment because how useful the GamePad is depends a lot on the persons situation. So even if its not amazing for them they should at the very least understand why it can be amazing for others and vice versa. I would like to see more games like ZombiU or Nintendo Land as well but I also appreciate features like in WWHD or Off TV play ,wiiu,cezh3ha,1,t5_2sjnz

189628,0,t1_cezzze6,The tutorials are a huge dentriment  to this game. The fact that you couldnt skip that robot chick giving you the finger for the first half hour of gameplay made me angry when I was so excited to just get in and start playing this game. I get why theyre there but let me skip that the same way you skip tutorials ingames. Plus why isnt the default setting that it remembers that I already did a tutorial and default to skipping it?

192082,0,t1_cezrbvl,Id like to add before using the micro cloth gently mop it along the screen to remove dirt and dust even if you dont see a lot of dirt or dust.  I hold it at an angle when doing this so it can fall away from the screen.  If you press hard with the cloth and there is dirt on the screen itself you can be left with damage.  Warm water work great you dont need a special solution although I use eyeglass cleaner that is safe on plasticedit to clarify when mopping the screen do it whith a dry micro cloth. you dont want dirt clinging to a wet micro cloth.,wiiu,cf0bgoh,2,t5_2sjnz

Hopefully we can look back on this in  months and feel like Nintendo followed through on their plans and stategies.Compared to the arrogance that Microsoft showed when they unveiled much of their plans for the Xbox One this is refreshing to see.Glad to see them specifically address all the poorly thought articlesideas on how to save Nintendo exiting hardware scrapping the WiiU migrating to smartphonesPartnerships utilizing licensed characters will be interesting... if they partnered with Disney that could boost salesexposure immensely... as for development partners Im sure tons of studios would love to work with Nintendo,wiiu,cf2l0xa,2,t5_2sjnz

Im not saying this argument hasnt been made before but I havent seen it before and I thought it was a very good point. This is the first persuasive argument Ive seen for why it was a mistake to use the Wii name.

It takes time and resources to make sure not only the emulators perform to their standards but that each game they release to the service is performing as it should be.

The game doesnt explain this very well but you can lock on to something by holding the left trigger and then if you press B ALL of your available pikmin will attack the objective at once carrying pieces tearing down wall swarming enemy etc. This is much faster than throwing them one at a time.gt . Related to the above even if youre not locked on idle pikmin who are next to an interactable will interact with it automatically. This means you can often just walk so your pikmin are next to something and then press B to idle them and they will start carryingbuildingetc.I dont know why but reddit is changing my numbers  and  to  and . Anyway I play with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk because I find it much easier to aim. To have all your Pikmin rush a locked on target you shake the nunchuk. However I find that this jostles the pointer of the wii remote around to much and my Pikmin often just separate into color groups instead of rushing. Any tips for that?

439718,0,t3_1z42wd,Funny I actually just bought a Wii U Windwaker bundle and Super Mario d last night. I mainly got it because theres really not much incentive to get a ps at the moment since the library is still really small. Theres already a lot of great games for the Wii U so by the time I catch up to the current back log there should be some more anticipated titles out.So far I really enjoy it. The controller was something I never knew I wanted. Its incredibly easy to browse and switching from the various apps feals seamless. Its also great to be able to take the game with me anywhere. Not just games either it essentially functions as a tablet and can make life easier. So now if my wife and I are watching the same show on Netflix I can take the controller with me and keep watching in the kitchen while I make dinner or if she wants to watch TV I can keep playing Mario without even having to hit pause.So far the biggest negative to the system will be the lack of rd party next gen games. First party games will most certainly be excellent but it is a bit disappointing knowing that most of the bigger multiplatform games will either not be coming to the wii u or will be inferior not true in all cases. I mainly got it so I could play the excellent Nintendo games and have some really good local multiplayer when the time arises. ,wiiu,cfqcb68,4,t5_2sjnz

456621,0,t3_1zbc84,I would say PC is a much better value than any console will ever offer you. Youll have a larger library to choose from  particularly if you want FPSMMOs etc. plus theyre significantly more versatile. Any extra initial costs incurred will quickly be made up for by Steam Sales so a cost comparison is a relative nonfactor I think though over a couple years the PC will likely be cheaper if you buy more than a handful of  WiiU games and controllers. You can still have some multiplayer fun too with others who have decent computers and many likely will. If you dont already have a laptopcomputer to take to school with you for work purposes then this doesnt even need to be a question. Get a PC.However going to live in a dorm presents a bit more of a unique social situation. Youre likely to be living in very close proximity to many people with comparable interests. Additionally being at school depending on the program your time might be more limited such that the expanded library of the PC might not matter because you wont have time to play everything you want anyway. This is where the fewer Nintendo gems might work equally well. Youll actually have a great opportunity to enjoy some local multiplayer with good friends  some Mario Kart Smash  tournaments will no doubt be a big hit plus some Super Mario D world and others wont hurt either. When youre alone the ability to lay down in bed and play using the offscreen play will be delightful too for relaxing.So honestly it depends a bit on your current computer situation and what you expecthope to make out of your social life. Sorry if that only makes the decision harder.,wiiu,cfs60sq,5,t5_2sjnz

PAnyhow in general I agree with much but really I dont think the people calling for structural or big changes got any sensible point either. I know from workexperience that just throw money at it rarely fixes an issue.Honestly I think that the best course of action for Nintendo at this point might be to abandon the WiiU somewhat in the sense that Id work on a DS connection system and allow the WiiU hardware to be recycled for that for those who have it and offer a cheaper specializedonly hardware for it later on.So a DSv  that home console allow streaming gameplay on the big TV using a WiiUPad like controller or just using that for the people who have the console.The system would basically take the one really really amazing function of the WiiU and centre entirely around it being a portable handheld console in all other regards. I could close the DSv play with WiiUPad on TV then when my GF wants to play on PS or PS I switch back to DSv and play there.Etc.That way they can salvage the existent hardware at the same time not waste further time on a minority game system i own it and I love it but businesswise it might be smarter to move on and work on the very good market they got instead.,wiiu,cgajzpy,0,t5_2sjnz

Thats a lot of games per  disc. Thats a good value. If Nintendo had a thing for  where you got SNES game NES game GBA game GBC game GB gameI would probably buy that. Its fair. They can just have volume after volume of  game packs come out and I would pretty much grab those all day. But I wont pay  for a single game and I never will. Nintendo will never get my money for that stuff. And its pure profit at this point. Like one of my kids said to me yesterday If Nintendo sold the VC cheaper more people would buy it and theyd sell more systems because the eShop would be a selling point since you could get tons of old games cheaply on it.,wiiu,cgl64jt,3,t5_2sjnz

They have the strongest back catalog in the business and they are leaving so much money on the table by not selling it.  The Wii U has been out a year and a half and there are still no N titles no Gamecube titles SNES games are slowly being released and havent even reached parity with the Wii VC after a year and a half!  That should have been day one!.  I just cant understand why Nintendo are focusing their efforts on putting out GBA games on the Wii U right now.Maybe I was a little too flip with my initial post.   The thing is as a Nintendo fan Im frustrated.  Ive watched them make poor decision after poor decision and I just cant understand what theyre thinking.  And yes Ive seen a trend of posts critical of Nintendo being downvoted into oblivion in this sub and I dont think it will help to pretend the Wii U isnt failing or pretend it isnt Nintendos poor decision making that took it there.,wiiu,cgn55ic,1,t5_2sjnz

730579,0,t1_cgmqtgh,This post is something I agree with completely. I have owned every major nintendo system since the NES but I am primarily a PC gamer. I heard the announcement of the Wii U and would occasionaly see something about it on Polygon but whenever it is featured all they show is the controller.           So until yesterday I believe the Wii U was an addon similar to the Vita and the Play station. I had no desire to own a mobile console to play with the Wii.          Then I saw a video for Mario Kart  and decided it was time to really find out what the system was. After some digging I discover that it is a stand alone system that is backwards compatabile and features the controller as just that a controller and not a mobile gaming device.          Sure I eventually bought the system but I might have bought it on launch day if I knew it was a system and not an accessory to the last generation.,wiiu,cgnbk1h,3,t5_2sjnz

733177,0,t1_cgnlwbs, months is a pretty long time. Especially with the DS version out and people working on that shifting focus to the Wii U version. The DS version is lacking a lot that the Wii U version will have. It seems the DS v. will lack a lot of the collectibles from the Wii U v. The shown example being music.  per stage on DS. Many many more on Wii U.DS releasing over summer will tide people over and get them incredibly hyped for the superior Wii U version. Especially with the connectivity features between the two that they have yet to announce. During those  months they can add many features and modes. Such as a bulky single player experience. Smash Bros later in the year is great. Mario Kart releases right at the end of May. Smash Bros U too close to it would be a bad idea. Just as well theres a good chance at E they will showcase more titles to be released between the two. Smash is planned to be their heavy hitter title to close out the year.,wiiu,cgnm6xz,-1,t5_2sjnz

That means you can pick up any character and feel like you at least have some idea of what youre doing.  Secondly there arent set combos in the game.

This means youre always learning something new and every game is different and exciting.Beyond that its just an awesome party game to sit down and play with four people.

But the biggest issue which they have yet to repair is the fact that if you run your console to the TV via HDMI the Netflix app for whatever reason assumes youre running it through a recorder and cuts the stream to the TV. Of course you could work around this by also having a backup output I use the old Wii component cables plugged in at the same time and whenever you want to use Netflix you just go to Settings set the display to NonHDMI change your input and youre good.

832464,0,t3_23mpz0,I got a lot of single player play out of it but i know not everyone did. I played a lot of Metroid Blast especially and got through the entire game by myself and later with friends. This was a great game.I finished Pikmin Baloon Creezethis one is very difficult to play off TV but I have done it a few times and Donkey Kong by playing off TV. The Pikmin one was the best of those. Donkey Kong was a game with great mechanics that is hindered by the difficulty level. The problem is that there is a very difficult bit right at the end of the first level that will almost certainly require an online tutorial to figure out how to cover a jump.I am still playing Zelda. If you are an archer you can play off TV single player. However it is a difficult game as a lone archer.So now you have the following games which need another person Mario Chase Luigis Ghost Mansion Animal Crossing.Then the games you can play single player that need the TV are Zelda if you want to use a sword and shield Yoshis fruit kart Takamarus Ninja castlethe ninja stars game Octopus dance and the FZero game.I personally think that if youre getting the game for about  it is worth it for those off TV experience I mentioned especially Metroid blast. However the true value of this game is the multiplayer experience and you should not buy it at full price if you are not going to play the multiplayer at all.,wiiu,cgywjbe,1,t5_2sjnz

Thats about it.It absolutely doesnt mean that people bored of particular franchise they are not that fast to get bored of as suggesting AC and CoD franchises still exist and they produced way more games per generation than there were Mario titles which actually changed gameplay mechanics. Franchises are what people usually buying. Like you it or not.There are Wonderful  for Wii U. New and risky. How many people bought it or at least tried it? Well? Investing in Bayonetta sequel is risky too.I read all those arguments which doesnt stand ground at all for so long I got of them tired already.

1179923,0,t3_27luvq,I was really skeptical about this at first mostly because of correlations between stats... when acceleration goes up speed tends to go down.However I just tested this myself.  My default config was lightweight speed kart slick tires acceleration glider speed . acceleration . weight  handling . traction ..  I was using a lightweight mostly for acceleration benefits.However using an identical kart configuration Mario midweight and DK heavyweight had identical acceleration to Toad and actually started to pull ahead after a bit because of their increased speed.  DKs stats in that kart combo are speed . acceleration  weight . handling . traction ..Does anyone know if all stats are tiered or just acceleration?  Because if all stats are tiered including speed then heavyweights like DK may be the best balance of accelerationspeed since DKs speed is maxed out at  rather than superheavyweights like Bowser.,wiiu,ci2d0ml,1,t5_2sjnz

Sony may have had a great conference at last years E but there are plenty of people pissed at them derailing into the lets talk about living room entertainment segment that burned Microsoft last year.Nintendo just happens to be the easiest of the big three to pick on because theyre on the farthest end of the spectrum away from what the majority generally wants.

1229218,1,t1_ci7v13l,A huge install base that doesnt buy software. The Wii had a terrible attachment rate because people bought Wii Sports a few shovel ware party games and Mario kart. Only big time gamers which werent plentiful on the Wii bought much more than that. The problem EA has is that the Wii U audience is much more informed than the Wiis was and wont stand for halfassed games like EA thought they would. Its not even just Wii U most of what EA releases is halfassed rushed buggy loaded with problems and never fixed because DLC is more important than a properly functioning game. The other console players eat that shit up because of marketing and hype while Wii U owners tend to look at it and say no this game is poorly made all around but even more so for the Wii U Im not buying that so EA realized theyd actually have to try to get our business and said fuck it its not worth actually putting forth effort.,wiiu,ci7wl16,-2,t5_2sjnz

You can only get  free game code per Club Nintendo account HOWEVER every master CN account can create children CN sub accounts and each of those can redeem their own MK code and get a free game and that code you get can be redeemed onto the parent CN account.Once you log into your  account click on account settings on the right side of the screen on the right side of the main profile page you will see add account.  Can create child accounts this way set the age to at least   or earlier as nintendo wont allow kids to get a free game yeah I dunno why either.It all sounds complicated but its really easy and completely transparent when done i got  free games and when I log into my wii U I play em all without having to do any tricks I have  child accounts off my club nintendo account and each redeemed their own MK code the red insert in MK.,wiiu,cie3lo0,1,t5_2sjnz

1375448,0,t3_29srs5, Fix the international stores pricing and regular offers to the USA store... On the Mxico eShop a US. game cost US MX. I understand the physical version has taxes packing storage space and such things but the digital one?   Stop making me pay for games I already own. I like Steam and GOG for this they have a new version for the game you bought a while back and its available for free... See FTL recent upgrade ok I know thats the developer option but most of my VC games are Nintendo games and I have to pay again to play the slightly enhanced version or play the old one on an emulated emulator?   Nintendo owns rights to the best games on history why not rerelease all of them on VC form? EVERYONE! Please poke WB and include N Rush series too... I know Rare games are a very very long shot.   I have no DS but if I buy one Id like to have a shared selection of VC games to play at home and on the go also shared saves Ask Steam they know how to or who wouldnt like be playing NES TMNT on WiiU save state transfer to DS over WiFi and continue while commuting with official support of course?.   Better organization on the store feels too cramped and having banners everywhere is like trying to find the tv remote on a zillion pillow fortress.   Expand Club Nintendo rewards to International players too... Ok thats outside the eShop but somehow related to it because if they fix prices much more people will buy from it and benefit from the rewards I have lots of CN pins from my games what I do with those?

Ive spent almost all my gaming time with the Wii U NSMBU Mario D World Mario Kart  Wind Waker HD the Lego Movie game Sonic All Stars Super Metroid and Kirby on the VC and three party games like Wii U Party and Nintendo Land...

If Nintendo can come up with a solution and simplify the controller situation with Wii U right now I think it could do a lot to drive sales.Being able to sit down and play Nintendo games from consoles all throughout their history with a single controller that you like best would be a massively marketable feature. It could not only get people to buy more older titles it could drive new hardware sales from people trying to consolidate their consoles into a single solution.Plus I think itd sell a lot of pro controllers. They are really amazing controllers awesome build quality and battery life but I think they arent tremendously popular at the moment because of their limited use. People would rather wait it out for the gamecube controller adapter or use old wii motes instead even if they like the pro controller more. I think thats a sad fate for a good controller.,wiiu,cisc9hn,1,t5_2sjnz

1464155,0,t1_cizmt1r,Why would I be upset? Always happy to educate!Club Nintendo is a rewards system that give points based on games and hardware you get from Nintendo. If youve bought a  physical first party title recently something Mario Zelda Kirby etc. it probably had a red insert with a code on it. That code generates a certain amount of coins that can be traded in for goods both physical and digital. Physical goods seem to refresh and change inventory at any given time whereas the digital goods refresh every month. You also get Coins for eShop purchases and that applies to nearly download Shovel Knight for example gives  coins. Games generate surveys and surveys may be randomly issued as well which you get coins for completing.Gold and Platinum status are achieved by registering either  gold or  platinum coins in one year July st to June th. In past years the rewards have been physical gold almost always gets a calendar platinum gets something special like posters pins or items not obtainable otherwise. This year has been a selection of downloadable games that are available on the eShop leaving status holders generally less than pleased. The general consensus is to keep registering products but dont scramble to make status in case this is the new precedent. As the average game only gives between  coins I think their reaction is understandable.Registering is as easy as going to  and signing up. You cant retroactively claim any eShop purchases youve already made but any inserts you have from your physical games DSWiiDS and WiiU games AND systems you can still register!,wiiu,cizt300,2,t5_2sjnz

Sure there will be a sales increase and some people are holding off buying a Wii U until it releases but it wont be close to the amount who were pushed over the edge by the release of MK.

If people who are spending  to yr on Nintendo stuff cash obviously isnt an issue.  If thats going to be the case they might as well make it a  eshop bonus when you buy anything Nintendo.  Then they can do away with the club altogether.Club Nintendo used to be about rewarding loyal customers with EXCLUSIVE items not available to just anyone in exchange for taking our time to provide them with market feedback.  Now anyone with  in their pocket can get the same things with no effort.Some of you are obviously happy with the digital rewards thats absolutely fantastic for you.  Im glad youre happy I really am.  Some of us however have grown up with Nintendo since the s.  I still have all my consoles and the majority of my games.  I dont want my stuff digital.  None of it.  Ive put years into my collection it makes me happy and I enjoy showing it off.  Im happy that my kids can grow up playing many of the same awesome games I did.  I really wish you guys would understand that even though youre happy with a bunch of year old B list digital games the rest of us dont have to be.

1519435,0,t1_cj6kp1u,To be fair that  in sales is also noted in that survey along with the rest of the Indie stats to be attributed to anyone and everyone being able to make a game now so the Indie category includes Kickstarterbacked games like Shovel Knight as well as anyone spending a weekend making a flash game over in Unity. Thats why we see  making most of the money. With a budget of nearly nothing between a few people k in sales a year is a pretty good living with even a modest catalogue each selling only kyear each per title not being too bad either.Ill agree games are now valued lower thanks to the giant marketplaces on Steam and mobile pushing prices down since everyone now has an insurmountable backlog but Indie developers do better than that survey made it out to be.

If youre truly not exaggerating and you ruled out your TV as a cause then you should probably contact Nintendo.If youre exaggerating a bit my bet is still on the TV.

My biggest problem was that I would try to collect everything which got me killed a lot some collectibles can be really difficult to get to and require precise timing. Mind you thats if youre wanting to  it. If not then the game is not too hard to just get to the end some levels will make you rage cause they can be cheap the first time through. The rocket barrel levels are my worst nightmare but Ive done them enough now that it isnt too bad.Mario is easy for the most part mind you Ive played all the platforming Mario titles so for me it probably was easy due to experience. I breezed through most levels without too much trouble although Super Star Road is another thing entirely.

1544438,0,t3_2bwru7,I use Rosalina|Sport Coupe|Cyber Slick|Cloud Glider when TTing. Generally a  second gap from WR is a decent time.  seconds is average. Depends on the course and how much time youve spent though. Id also recommend spending a lot of time on one course before moving on to other courses. At which point youll be able to do better on other courses more easily. Not even  seconds in yet and I see a terrible terrible mistake. Take those  coins one the first straight.  coins will easily cut off . seconds if not more that early in a run. Actually you took  coins lap . Thats a good  seconds you couldve just cut off from collecting  coins on lap . Dont worry about bunny hopping at all. Just focus on clean tight turns. Only hop when you want to start a drift. Go to Royal Raceway if you want to practice bunny hopping before using it elsewhere. Bunny hopping is more of a luxury after learning to take good lines. Although it is okay to shroom and bunny hop on the final straight since thats not too difficult. See current WR Coins increase top speed Coins gotten earlier affect a run for longer Tighter turns are a must. If you arent dangerously close to hitting walls every run youre doing something wrong. Coins are worth going out of the way to get but not too far On the last turn before the glider always charge an orange MT. Its . sec faster than just a blue MT and allows you to bunny hop up that hill. Look up softdrifting. Itll make charging orange SMTs on certain turns easier. Like the st turn on MKS and WP. Coins are too important to ignore.  coins is the way to go on the majority of courses. There are exceptions but this course isnt one.,wiiu,cj9vagy,3,t5_2sjnz

1659727,0,t3_2db83n,Welcome to the club! long time Ninja GaidenD fan. razors edge is fine they kinda worked the mechanics of the second game into the previously released third game. I think the hero mode is a response to the games infamous difficulty and punishing learning curve. And just like Konflyk said dodging blocking cant hurt to learn how to counter.  Just study the enemies animations and practice a few specific combos and you wont have a problem tackling the harder difficulties. EDIT Dont let the camera be a barrier.

The character of link is changed in almost every Zelda game. The character is eliminated in almost every instalment link is no longer the same link we knew from the last game with each entry in the series. Why shouldnt the next one be a female? Its not like were talking about James Bond here a character with a cohesive and enriched back story.The character of link is a pretty blank canvas at the best of times.

1712963,0,t1_cjv0fif,Hmm sounds a bit personal. Anyway I dont believe thats how people think when playing M rated games like Bioshock Metal Gear Half life Persona Silent Hill Heavy Rain Elder Scrolls No More Heroes etc many of which are not even competitive in nature. Its silly to assume that most people playing these types of games are trying to prove themselves as men. Should I be concerned about my wife then? lol I also dont believe a game needs to rated M to appeal to that age group. But its not just the lack of Mature games but the fact that most if the time the  age group is seemingly purposely left out of their marketing and target audience. Theres plenty of mature TV shows as well that appeal to older audiences and dont exactly try to pander to adolescent views of maturity. And as much as I love Mario I have to disagree. Mario games and Pixar or Ghibli movies may be aesthetically cartoony but Mario does not come anywhere near the depth of those movies when it comes to plot and character development which engages adults. Im not sure I would enjoy playing Mario games as much today had I not grown up with them. ,wiiu,cjv2xo0,3,t5_2sjnz

In other words Id like to see games that make the wii u version the preferred version of the game even when these games are available on other consoles. To ubisofts point most of their games look best on playstation so for someone who has both the playstation version is a better buy.  Wii U is a unique console with a lot of possibilities and should be treated that way by developers.

Technically the wii u discs are blu rays but they use different logic to get out of paying Sony for blu ray support. Personally I think Nintendo should have just eaten the licensing cost to enable blu  ray support.

1850485,0,t3_2fqelt,Get the WiiU. Destiny hasnt come out yet and it very well may be another Titanfall. When first playing that game everyone was singing its praises to the sky...but then it got old after a bit. Destiny could very well be the same. If it turns out after a few weeksmonths nobody is getting tired of it then definitely pick it up. Youre right in that a white PS isnt important. Ultimately ask yourself what games you really want to play on both systems. If Destiny is the only game then wait. If WiiU you only have one game then even for that I would say wait but WiiU definitely has a lot of good quality games out at the moment. Its as you said  youre hyped by the gameplay and dont want to be deceived by the marketing. Im sure the Beta for Destiny was fantastic and Ive heard a lot of great things...but its only one game and it might turn out to not really be your cup of tea. WiiU is the safer pick imo. ,wiiu,ckc6gg2,1,t5_2sjnz

1912669,0,t1_ckjmykk,Facepalm. No it didnt cause any issue and I can decipher what he meant or the message behind it.See mojang is only known for Minecraft so the obvious reason for acquiring them is Minecraft. I get it. But still there is a difference. What the topic conveys is that Microsoft has bought Minecraft IP and not Mojang itself. Which couldve have happened considering Nintendo owns Fatal Frame Sony owns Sound Shapes Flower without purchasing the whole company.What uSylverstone was implying that just by buying Minecraft MS technically owns the whole development team. Since I work in a development company I know how IPs are handled. A company can outright buy a whole product but the developers behind still remain intact they work like they used to be but on different project. Another example of Crytek selling Homefront to Deep Silver and now DS is developing the game in a whole new studio.What here has happened is Microsoft has bought the whole company every single employee stay as it is unless they want to leave like Notch. Let me say this again for the last time in the simplest form.Minecraft is not Mojang. It is a subset of Mojang.MS couldve own Minecraft without owning Mojandevelopers but they bought the whole company.,wiiu,ckjnxbc,1,t5_2sjnz

1959309,0,t1_ckohbkv,My issue with the adventure mode is that there is no difficulty setting for it. As I have completed the story mode already all of the missions so far in the adventure mode has been ridiculously easy. For example some of my characters nearly shot the bosses with the weak point smash as their level is so high with skill trees nearly completed. There has been no challenge for my lower level characters either as they have powerful weapons. For example the base strength of a weapon is  attack power but most of my weapons are in the  range with several slots in them. I guess I could handicap myself by using worse weapons but honestly I shouldnt have to restrict myself like that.This is why I would recommend playing Adventure mode and the Legend mode at the same time instead of solely focusing on finishing the story first like I did.Also there seems to be some confusion going on about the ranking system. A lot of players believe that theres a Srank in the adventure mode but the Srank is actually the western versions Arank. So for EUNA the Arank is actually the best rank you can get. Personally Ive gotten that from all the missions Ive played with ease it depends on your killKO amount clear time and the damage you took. If you get two Aranks and one Brank your total rank for the mission will still be B.,wiiu,ckparrg,1,t5_2sjnz

Bronze is a new weapon type gold is an upgrade for an existing weapon.  Upgrade are the same kind of weapon with a new name and higher stats.  Essentially a new tier of the weapon.Some missions are quite hard to Arank.  Time and damage are the two big factors that usually cost you gold.

My only complaint is that I wish the rewards were completion based rather than coin based. I like that theres extra incentive to replay courses get Star rating or higher but the K limit is just stupid for the Gold Glider and I miss having fun little rewards for beating cups and getting things like the All Cup Tour mode from Double Dash.

2127392,0,t1_cl9nbdx,This is a great post.There are a lot of women who usually wont play games because of how they make them feel disempowered. I dont think it matters if these women end up playing or not. Games should not be made to the lowest common denominator. Yeah some will be but so so many have nods in this direction that it really is problematic.Any media creator has some level of responsibility for what they present to their viewers as they are shaping perceptions.It is ok to have an occasional game which has sexual characters. However the game should be sold in that way it should not do it in a subversive way like it is now where women are disempowered across most games due to their representation.Yes its getting better but it isnt good enough yet.,wiiu,cla8kwn,2,t5_2sjnz

2143177,0,t3_2jjbct,not really. The timeline itself is a pretty recent addition to the Zelda universe and many of the games stand alone very well. There are a few exceptions of direct sequels that the games vaguely allude to.OoT comes before MMWW  TP come an undisclosed but considerable amount of time after OoT this is where it gets difficult considering the timelinesaLttP comes before LALoZ comes before LoZIISkyward Sword is first.Like I stated previously however each title works quite naturally on its own besides some vague references to an overarching timeline with the exception of SS considering the story seems to have been built with the timeline in mind I often like to think of each title as a retelling of the same story from a different timeculturereligionperspective much like the flood story of common myth. The timeline is interesting but it doesnt have much effect on the over all story other than tying each title together. Whether thats for the better or worse is up to the individual player. Only the direct sequels with the same incarnation of Link make much sense to be explicit about but even then only hardly.,wiiu,clc8v2v,1,t5_2sjnz

2154547,0,t3_2jmgvu,YES I would definitely be interested in this. Earthbound and Okami are two of my favorite games so sign me up for that!!One thing I would like to say though be careful with how the final product turns out. Too many indie devs try too hard to make games inspired by retro for nostalgia purposes. Their games generally end up being a worse version of X and I would hate to see this be a worse version of Earthbound. You also need things that make your game different from its inspiration.Might be harsh to say but I think its something to keep in mind.

2205965,0,t1_clia8e1,Question regarding the first Bayonetta. Im finishing levels but Im noticing Im missing a lot of secret areas. I guess I wasnt doing that great a job of searching around. Ive found a handful of Alfheim but Im assuming these account for a lot of what Im missing in levels. However are there also Secret Verses similar to the Secret Missions in Wonderful ? I havent found too many branching paths but maybe from backtracking?On the subject of the Alfheim Im finding these to be quite difficult. Especially the ones where you have a limited number of punches and kicks. Any tips for these? The ones where you can only use Wicked Weaves I also found frustrating because if you accidentally hit an opponent it cancels your combo. Definitely finding these tougher than Ws Kahkoo. ,wiiu,clk8cvu,1,t5_2sjnz

You learn how to play a char and a kart whatever track gets thrown at you. If you wanna pick a new one you back out and pick a new one. You dont do it each round that would just waste everyones time.No its not COD. Its a racing game. Totally different genres. Its a pick up and play atmosphere. Its not about optimizing and loadouts and whathaveyou. The best players can dominate any track with any char in any kart. If you wanna be boss you gotta get that good.

2290516,0,t3_2lhjw1,The thing you need to understand is that Nintendo NEVER does simple ports. They will ONLY port something if it will run exactly like the original product did. Part of the reason a lot of games people want have not been released is because getting them to run in that state to Nintendos satisfaction would take a lot of work and yet people would balk if that simple port was more than . It would be difficult for Nintendo to make any respectable ROI on that.Nintendo is concentrating on new games or remakes that will sell systems and that they can sell for the profit margin that they need.There are some people that would buy those ports on the eShop but Nintendo likely does not have enough data to show that they would sell enough of them to be worth the effort. Its shitty to give that as a reason but it seems the most likely one.,wiiu,clutoe8,6,t5_2sjnz

It shows a lot of character within the pikmin and enemies. Pikmin get into silly hijinks and pikmin die in sad ways. Theyre definitely worth checking out. Though as you said I feel  was a bit too much for most people. I really want to see more of this direction from Nintendo so I supported it. The films were definitely good though.

Probably better that way anyways i guess.,wiiu,clztshh,0,t5_2sjnz

2335074,0,t3_2m2inx,Initial analysis. The Lego Movie bombed. It will be off the charts in a week two if were lucky.. Wii U is keeping a baseline of about    units week over week. Its low and the console is ceding valuable ground to the PS at this point.. Mario Kart no longer has the power to shift systems in Japan. Smash Bros. will undoubtedly be the next big mover in December though how much itll do has yet to be seen. Smash DS is still selling well though as weve seen that doesnt always carry over to the console space.. Until we see something concrete Im remaining skeptical of the pent up demand for bundles. This seems to be the popular myth propagating the community but the numbers themselves dont add up given the current Japanese gaming market.So yeah... very bad week overall and we can only hope that the steady software releases from now through  will prop the system up til New Years.,wiiu,cm0bt2e,4,t5_2sjnz

2381021,0,t1_cm5ue9h,Its because month to month Wii sales were in the toilet in all regions when the Wii U was released.  Nintendo needed cash flow from the console and they had squeezed absolutely all the juice out of the Wii that was possible. The biggest mistake Nintendo made with the Wii U was the controller.  They ended up putting a lot of money into that and to be honest its value has never really been shown.  Its had some added value for sure but I dont think its value has been worth the cost.  Nintendo needed to release the console earlier as spec wise it wouldnt compete with the other two however the price point had to be similar due to the cost of the controller.  The controller also caused a multitude of consumer confusion about whether it was just an add on to the Wii that Nintendos marketing failed to ameliorate.  In retrospect the Wii U would have been better served by ditching the tablet making the Pro Controller standard along with shipping with a WM Controller and a more powerful system.  Instead of putting all that money into the controller spending it on a more powerful system would have put it in a better marketing position.  Obviously a different name would have also helped.  ,wiiu,cm603jk,2,t5_2sjnz
2381237,0,t3_2mo6ih,I would gladly take a drop in frame rate for this option.   With split screen you cant see as far to the left and right which makes it harder to set up for turns.

2383274,0,t3_2mk7go,For sure. The ones Id most want in order are MK Wii GCN DS and GBA.I really dont want the GBA one because I think one flat rainbow road is enough for MK.  The DS rainbow road is kind of boring but it already has some antigravity sections which would make it a nice fit.  But really the MK and Wii RRs are just amazing so Id be happy with either.,wiiu,cm6a4ea,1,t5_2sjnz
2384561,0,t1_cm5x59y,I dont think you can infer anything about quality from that other than the PC gamers favourite console market isnt big enough. The bulk of the PSs sales probably arent coming from people who also own gaming PCs. Nintendo are knocking it out of the park with their first party exclusive but whilst the multiplats are a graveyard it will never sell like the PS. The Wii U is a great console but its hard to recomend if it was going to be your only gaming machine.,wiiu,cm6furw,1,t5_2sjnz

2387765,0,t1_cm6lhps,They may not have official agreements but it can be pretty shitty in a lot of industries.  FedEx and UPS for example mostly match each other tit for tat on policies services and average shipping costs there are variances but the overall average ends up being the same.  And it isnt by keeping each others prices low whenever one thinks of a new charge or announces a rate increase the other quickly raises theirs to match.  Its an escalating game rather than one of fiercer competition and margins.The one that really irks me is Home Depot and Lowes.  They both have policies to beat each other by like  so they end up purposely pricing most of their things to be exactly the same.  The last time I asked one to price match the customer service lady was genuinely shocked and took extra steps to verify they were actually cheaper because its so uncommon outside of certain sales.  And of course she was right I misread the label and they actually did charge the same and wouldnt give me the discount.,wiiu,cm6u340,1,t5_2sjnz

Being an indie platform isnt going to move consoles sorry.  gtmarketing was terrible but but mainly it was due to how the hell do you explain the damn tablet i found myself not being able to tell people why it was a awesome and improved the gameplay   Its easy as hell to market. Nintendo was riding off the Wii name and it bit them in the ass. Most of the casual audience that bought a Wii for the novelty arent interested anymore. It was a once in a lifetime thing the Blue Ocean strategy.  gtbut once they were able to play it they understood Wii U was sold by word of mouth now with big games its selling it self  Its not selling enough to warrant only word of mouth advertisement.

2458681,0,t1_cmfksel,No problem! Thank you for getting it squared away!. This one is tough. Mario Kart  has been really fun with friends over. And D World was great. All their first party stuff has been crazy good this year! But Little Inferno holds a special place in my heart. I think that game is brilliant. . That is a weird story. We actually use a web framework for our web design and development projects called Wombat Juice. Developed by Tim When we started wanting to do personal projects outside of work we decided to form a think tank group so that we could explore our passions. I think Wombat Games and some other names were already taken. So we settled on Source as an extension. Kind of boring story. If it was up to me we would call ourselves PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA. Or something dumb like. . Were not sure yet. We do want to wrap up our iPad game Super Treasure Adventure superta.net  that is what we were working on before we got a call from Nintendo letting us know we could make an eShop game. I have to redo a lot of art on it. We are going to go bigger with our next Wii U game and probably use Unity. Apple Watch is pretty interesting maybe something with that. We also have some other game related stuff in the works too. We see GetClose as a fun party game that hopefully leads to bigger things. ,wiiu,cmflf5m,1,t5_2sjnz

Nintendo only has  more home consoles than Sony. I still for some reason see Sony as that company that jumped in the game in  where as I still see Nintendo as like the definition of video games.

2463046,0,t1_cm2jzfo,You dont have to use gyro. It just adds an immediate layer of control into your conventional analog controls. With it you can immediately point where you like or just fine tune the rough movements of the analog controls.With analog controls the developers have to either make easier challenges orAND include automation into gameswhich is antigaming. Gyro is like a autoaim that you control YOURSELF! Gyro aiming can make big movements immediately or if you just have to adjust your aim for just one pixel you can do it immediately as well. You cant have both with last gen controllers! If you crank your turning speed into max on last gen controllers you can just forget any ideas of hitting fast enemies that are far away and if you slow the controls down you lose every close combat.Gyro fixes that and also makes the game feel more immersive as it is you who are in control of the game and your movements are transferred into the gameworld.,wiiu,cmg4t3w,1,t5_2sjnz
2463527,0,t3_2neqgg,As someone who missed out on the Wii and just now bought a Wii U after  years I feel kind of lost. So I have a few questions Should I buy an extra remote? I have a PS and it seems like the batteries never last as long as youd expect them to. I find myself often switching controllers mid game. What kind of remote should I buy? GamePad? Pro? Wii Remote? Ive never played any Zelda ever but Ive wanted to play one of them for so long. The truth is I dont really know where to start. I bought a DS not too long ago  months and the only game Ive bought so far for that is Pokemon Y. Ive told myself I wouldnt buy another game for it until Ive finished Pokemon Y but what system and Zelda game should I play first? Is story relevant? I want to get games that either have a good storyline or have a good multiplayer experience. I realize that the Wii U is backwards compatible. Are there games that I should absolutely play or buy? Is there any cool interactivity that I can do with my DS and WiiU? What are some good upcoming games?Im already planning on getting Mario Kart . Any other games I should check out?

2483431,0,t1_cmiptgf,Oops basically that is the colour of the cardboard when there is no printed picture on it for these packages. If you can see that colour in that area it means that the plastic is no longer flush with the cardboard. There has been movement.That usually only ever happens when the packaging has been separated and reattached. And that would mean that the guy has opened the package and closed it again. Both were done extremely carefully but it is almost impossible to do this without a beige line appearing somewhere.This is because cardboard doesnt just separate when you cut it. It frays even when you cut it extremely carefully there can be a small amount of fraying. This is why cardboard is so difficult to reattach without people noticing.,wiiu,cmiq13a,5,t5_2sjnz

2546460,0,t1_cmqy50c,OffTV play needs to be supported by the game itself and is usually dependent on whether the game was designed to be displayed on one screen or two.  Most games support it and automatically display a copy of the TV display on the gamepad Mario Kart Super Smash Bros etc.  To use offtv play with these games simply turn the tv off and look at the gamepad screen.Other games support it but do not clone the tv output to the gamepad by default ex Wind Waker HD.  In cases like this theres a button that you can press usually the  button to make the gamepad the primary display instead of the TV.As for having the Wii U off thats not possible as the gamepad is merely a screen and a controller it still requires the Wii U to be on to actually run the game and output the display to the gamepad.  You dont need to have the Wii U hooked up to a tv at all to use offtv play though it just needs to be plugged into a power outlet.,wiiu,cmqyjie,4,t5_2sjnz

2554349,0,t1_cmrz5x5,gtThis is only true because of Nintendos lagging online capabilities and graphical capabilities.The lagging online capabilities is the fault of the developers which yes Nintendo is a developer that sucks at online.As far as graphical capabilities go Nintendo intentionally has it lower to reduce the price of the console. Graphics themselves arent needed at all to make a good selling console. Look at DS vs Vita and DS vs PSP.gt Nintendo pretends that they want rd party but they pretty much made it impossible for any truly next gen games to be ported to their system.I think they want rd Party but not multiplat. Which would be the ideal. Multiplat games are largely uncreative and bland anyway.gtWhat developer is going to want to limit their product to the lowest selling console? Marvelous Atlus Square Enix Tecmo Koei Bandai Namco Level  amongst others. Just because not all a companys games are exclusive doesnt mean none of them are. All of those companies have released Nintendo exclusive games.gtWhat would be in it for them unless Nintendo money hatted them?You know the entire point and goal of a Nintendo console? The target audience control scheme etc. I dont buy an Xbox if I want anime styled games. Id go for Sony or Nintendo for that. So if a developer wants to release such a game theyd do it on an appropriate console SonyNintendo. Nintendo narrows the niche further. You wouldnt see something like Rune Factory or Fantasy Life on a Sony or MS console. Nor would you see something like Battlefield on a Nintendo console regardless of whether its the strongest console or not.Theres a lot more to releasing and marketing games than just throwing them on as many consoles as possible.,wiiu,cmrzo4j,1,t5_2sjnz

2678326,0,t3_2qp2bb,. AFAIK all Wii games are compatible with Wii U. They run in an emulator that comes preloaded on the Wii U. You will need Wiimotes to play them.. Depends on what you like! What kinds of games do you like to play? The Wii was pretty good to Nintendos first party games so pick up Mario Galaxy  and  to start. There was a strong but small library on the Wii. Let me know what youre into and I can throw more recs your way. Lots of good Nintendo games some JRPGs etc. if we know what you like . Hmmm not really no. Ive yet to encounter a third part Wiimote that feels good in my hand is well made and functions well. I also dont think many any? third party controllers work with Wii Motion Plus.. Again what kind of games do you like? So far Ive really enjoyed Mario D World New Super Mario Bros. U. Hyrule Warriors Smash Bros Mario Kart Wind Waker HD WarioWare. Bayonetta...is not my thing...but users around here seem to have liked it. Wonderful  Pikmim  and Donkey Kong also get recd a lot but Ive never played them. Really most of the big games have been solid. There are some good looking games coming out like Xenoblade that Im excited for. eShop games like Shovel Knight and VC games like Golden Sun also top the list.. The Pro Controller! OMG I love the Pro Controller. Theres also a GameCube adapter so you can use those controllers with Smah Bros. Apparently they are hard to find. There are tons in my town though so who knows. Other than that the Wii U has not been as big on peripherals as the Wii was.. Yes! It will need to be formatted in a certain way though I think. As utapwater says it will need the YCable.,wiiu,cn86f5v,1,t5_2sjnz

That is the same argument that was used in the comic book industry for years and DC is still kind of following it... You cater to your core. But the problem is that the core will inevitably leave for whatever reason and you have a hard time getting the new folk. It sounds great on paper Brand loyalty etc but in practice it is the sign of a dying company.But yeah I will definitely agree that Nintendos family friendly angle avoids a lot of the stuff that has led to the discussion of women in gaming. It is a cop out but it is safe.And yeah I got the Wii U because I have enough disposable income and there are enough games that interest me otherwise I would skip it.

2786448,0,t3_2rztmy,I dont think its possible for that to have done any damage to the Wii U. Plugging in a Y cable as far as the Wii U is concerned is just another V device on the power supply. Couldve plugged in a keyboard DS or table fan its all the same power. It is possible for the Y adapter to do damage to the drive though. Be sure its a drive that can operate with both wall power and bus power. If its just a wall power drive the power from two buses might not be enough. The drive spins too slow for the read head. Conversely if its a bus power drive the extra power might cause it to spin too fast also causing damage.

2825435,0,t1_cnp67yf,Yes you can access the Wii Shop Channel and buy any VC games available on the Wii but then you can only access them through Wii mode and you can also only use Wii controllers Wii Remote Wii Remote  Nunchuk Wii Remote and Wii Remote  Classic Controller Pro the latter two being required for N games.VC games bought from the Wii U eShop however can be acessed directly from the menu and played with the Gamepad and Wii U Pro Controller in addition to Wii controllers. Unless youre itching for some Nintendo  games or SNES games not yet released in the Wii U eShop you should be buying all VC games from the eShop.Edit I see you mentioned an Wii emulator so Im assuming you mean the Wii mode on the Wii U which is not an emulator but rather the Wii OS running on a Wii U which is part of every Wii U system.

2828801,0,t1_cnpmoda, Splatoon Will Feature Full InGame Voice Chat posted by Elephox on Fri  Jun   GMTampampampgtgtgtThis is really exciting because its a sign that Nintendo may be looking to embrace a competitive scene for the game. Well have to see how things develop but combine this with being able to queue as a team and a ranked ladder and I could see Splatoon turning into a fullfledged esport.Comments gt Mithost gtgtI love how the collective opinion of Splatoon has evolved from What is this cartoony thing? to Hey guys I might actually want to get good at this. I think this kind of attitude is a good thing for the game and for Nintendo. The devs have marketed and shown off the game extremely well even providing some cool tech the ability to jump out of a puddle and instantly shoot to make another puddle you can jump in is neat. The game should definitely have a high skill ceiling.gtgtgtgtInGame Voice Chat will do wonders towards this competitive image. The community may suffer when you play with randoms but I can imagine some really good things coming from it. gt deleted gtgtdeleted gt LManD gtgtOK Im gonna say this. This seems like a fun and gasp actually interesting game but trust me this isnt going Esports. Look Im gonna admit I havent actually played it but based on what Ive seem so far overall the actual individual player stakes are fairly low. gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtFor better or worse competitive gaming in general because Im throwing the FGC into this too and Esports ! the FGC favors games with high player stakes v fighting games read all of them played competitively Quake  CounterStrike LOLDOTA Starcraft . Games that sorta minimize the impact of the players in favor of basing themselves on the impact of the overall team like Call of Duty Battlefield and this game Splatoon it seems just arent played competitively for the most part.gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtBasically because the latter minimizes the impact of individual players they tend to not be played competitively and yes I know COD is played competitively but they only play in v and disable killstreaks in order to bring back the player focus. gt ExplodingBarrel gtgtI would love to see this actually become an esport.

2868214,0,t1_cnu3ngl,gt But Metroid Prime obfuscates it very well much like Super Metroid there are worlds and major milestones but they tend to intermingle in a complicated web. Echoes like Corruption has three clearly distinct worlds that you basically delve into entirely in one gobut unlike Corruption Echoes doesnt mix up the formula dramatically within the worlds either.This i can see. I imagine part of the problem would be that it has effectively recycled the dual worlds concept The fact that it calls them Dark World and Light World doesnt help given the same names are used in A Link To the Past...gt had a fetch quest but IIRC it was simplified a great deal.This is good. My first playthroughs of Wind Waker MP and MP were all significantly delayed by literally years because I couldnt be assed to go find the endgame macguffins. Actually thats sort of a lie since Ive yet to beat MP for that very reason. Ive been putting it off because MPs final boss pissed me off.At the price point it is being offered I think the Trilogy would be worth it to me just for MP really as Ive never played it even though I have MP and MP on Gamecube and perhaps it will be more enjoyable with the motion controls. ,wiiu,cnu47xh,2,t5_2sjnz

I know phones and whatever have done it forever but those emulators always have some issue that Nintendo really cant let pass their QA whether its sound or some graphical glitches or whatever. The current VC for NES and GB games even still isnt exactly accurate either. Top this off with the fact that the DS has its own VC platform running in the background of it all.Im predicting the New DS will usher in the age of handheld SNES VC.

2937782,0,t1_co1z5gm,gt For those of you interested the story of the binding of isaac or the akedah is really important in Genesis bereishit in that moses defies god and doesnt kill isaac and it is the last time god talks to moses. Its kinda important in jewish stuff about why moses never saw the holy land but why christians would care I have no idea. source religion and jewish studies majorI also have studied the Bible and I think your source is severely mistaken. First of all Isaac is the son of Abraham. Secondly the Biblical record doesnt state he defies God but is completely obedient and God rewards the obedience by sparing his son and providing a ram to be sacrificed instead. I dont have Hebrew words to reference but I can point to the source of the story Genesis Whether or not you believe it I figured you might want to get your facts straight since you are majoring in this stuff.,wiiu,co21ele,15,t5_2sjnz

2989803,0,t3_2udej4,gtWhy advertise this? Its a Nintendo given. Its not a given unless parents have experience with consoles and even if they do many seem to think Wii and Wii U are the same thing.Many many people dont research the products they purchase. Im at Costco. Oh look PS and Xbox. Ill get my kids a console for Christmas. Hmm the PS box looks better and Minecraft for Xbox is sold out. Ive heard Minecraft is popular.  Ill buy a PS.  Nintendo never enters their mind if they havent been told its a familyfriendly platform. Virtually all of the advertising they see is for notNintendo consoles.As for mainstream blockbusters Wii U is overpriced. Its great for Nintendos profit margin but today investing in a game console is a  proposition when you add controllers charging stations sleeves and games. Nintendo would get a lot further with family sales if the Wii U dropped to  or  or made the gamepad optional and instead put a couple Pro controllers in the box.Why did I mention mainstream blockbusters? Because when people invest  into a console they want the games that have a wow visual factor which is exactly what mainstream games deliver. Nintendomade games are fantastic but people dont realize theyre fantastic from advertising.

This is no longer going to be possible...once the servers that serve up the old games get shut down its game over for those games as soon as consoles start breaking down.Think about it this way with the awful reliability of the XBOX  imagine when someone who has a bunch of digital games on theirs has it go belly up on them and they cant redownload them if they find a working replacement. ,wiiu,cojn8af,1,t5_2sjnz

3288257,0,t1_cp313q3,I think the excitement of the visuals comes from the artstyle and details. It  looks about as graphically good as Team Fortress  does which fulfills your  year old PC FPS comparison but it has a unique look about it kinda reminiscent of Jet Set Radios use of funky colors like lime and orange against city arenas which isnt a combination you see all that often. Its fairly plain but I like that its relatively easy on the eyes. Some shooters these days really go over the top with graphical effects and particles and it kinda makes it hard to tell what youre doing in a competitive environment so I for one am glad its keeping things relatively simple. I dont think thats a copout opinion either I know at least a good few competitive players  in Team Fortress  will dial down their graphical options to maximize what they can see. Still I get where youre coming from. Its a bit crazy to say it looks absolutely incredible but Im fairly sure most people are just talking about the art rather than any advanced graphical fidelity techniques. I think most of the excitement of the game comes from its competitive potential though. Lots of old school shooters were just as much about maximizing your movement options rocket jumping bunnyhopping etc. and team play as they were fragging and it seems Splatoon is keeping in line with that idea. I mean you can to warp to other teammates on spawn slide up walls hide in paint for stealth approaches or control your paint placement to find optimal ways to navigate the map. If anything I think thats what Im most excited about so long as Nintendo keeps in some solid matchmaking options to keep a good connection balances equipment properly and provides good map and weapon variety. ,wiiu,cp335y7,11,t5_2sjnz

3294536,0,t3_2xugyk,Im not sure this is the right place for the issue Im having but I cant find anything else across the internet that helps me.  Ive shared a Wii U for a little over a year and could very recently afford my own system.  I got the Super Mario D World deluxe bundle and kept the Wind Waker HD consoles gamepad from the one I was sharing.  that was an easy thing to switch.  I dont know why the software cant be as easy to move as the hardware.  one thing thats bugging me is that I really hate digital games and this bundle was originally released with physical ones.  its not just me I saw unboxings and other things and I was very happy to see physical games.  apparently between its initial release and now they changed it and theres not any way for me to put those digital games onto the older console as they were preinstalled and not given as codes.  since the person I was sharing with cares much less than I do and we had the physical games also I want to make that exchange if that would at all be possible.  if theres nothing I can do with that I can deal with it but the fact that I cant move them anywhere myself is one of the things I detest about digital games.  another problem is that Nintendo apparently makes it a massive headache to move my Network ID from one console to another.  on a support page on their site it says to contact them to move an account and when I try to go through the form I cant find anything specifically about moving a network ID and when I try to go through the topic of transferring content it sends me back to the Wii U to Wii U system transfer support page that I was just on.  I looked into the Wii U to Wii U system transfer while trying to fix the issues Im having and at a glance I thought it could help me with both problems but it doesnt let me choose what to transfer it just does everything and wipes both consoles.  why couldnt the feature just let me send my digital games one at a time and transfer single accounts?  would that really be such a difficult thing for them to program?  why must this be so complicated?  even if I transfer both accounts and all the content to the new system which I dont want to do anyway because hes keeping the old system and bought all the digital games that are on it Im likely to lose the two preinstalled games just to get my account working.  another reason why I hate digital but as much as I hate it I still want my games.  I have no idea why this isnt easier to do.  I work with technology and this is bothersome to me.  perhaps its because I work with tech that Im so frustrated with my lack of control over it.  I honestly have no idea how somebody who doesnt know about technology would try to fix this problem.  my main concern is getting my account on the new system.  I shouldnt have to make a new account for this.  I also really dont want those games digital if I can help it but Im much more worried about the ability to get my account working on the new system.  despite my reasons at this point the hatred of digital games is me being stubborn and picky.  not wanting two separate accounts is much more worrisome.  I got my username I already added all my friends I used Miiverse and its completely illogical to start over with everything Ive already done from my account.  if someone here can at the very least direct me to a page that actually lets me contact someone from Nintendo about either of these problems that would be great.  tldr I hate digital games want to try to move them but my main concern is moving my Network ID to a new console.  the contact form that Nintendo sent me to in order to do just that doesnt let me write anything to them.  what can be done and how do I do it?  ,wiiu,cp3sxxm,1,t5_2sjnz

3477755,0,t1_cponodj,Instead of attacking you here Im going to try to teach you something... then maybe we can be friends.p or  progressive is actually the vertical line resolution people reference when talking about x content. You see display resolutions are made up of X and Y values like x. You cant display much with x as thats just a single vertical line of pixels  unitspixels tall.When someone is talking to you about p they are referencing the vertical resolution or Y maximum. So if the content is widescreen or  you can easily figure out what the horizontal resolution might be for p content.Simply  figure out the ratios of  vs Unknown divide  by  then multiply the result by  which is . round it to the nearest integer because you cans have fractional pixels and that gives you .x is the full X and Y dimension of that p content. Get the product of that to see how many pixels are actually being displayed.x is  individual pixels on screen.  Do the same for p content x and you get  individual pixels on screen. Now we divide the p total pixels  by the p total pixels   and we get . just round that up to . So you see there are  times as many pixels in p content to render than in p video.Here is a cool chart from wikipedia showing various resolutions all the way up to k content,wiiu,cpoou6e,1,t5_2sjnz

3538880,0,t1_cpvl6ui,Id say it depends on the agreement that was reached between the buyer and seller. If it wasnt mentioned then I would assume that the seller just didnt know what they were doing and didnt know to reformat it not that they meant to include the games.Selling hardware is not the same thing as selling an account. When you sell a Wii U to a reseller it gets formatted. Theyre selling the console not games or an account with it.NNID is meant to be associated with a person. This person owns these games not the Wii U despite the NNID being tied to the console without big Ns intervention.My default assumption if the user didnt specify is that if a buy a used Wii U that I dont get games with it that the pervious owner installed. Obviously this is moot if they seller told the buyer that the games were included.Edit Also likely its against the TOS with nintendo to sell a NNID and the games associated with it but I havent looked in to it.,wiiu,cpvnl0c,1,t5_2sjnz

They arent the same thing at all because platformers often are timebased requires movement like jumping and require getting from point a b quickly while Pokemon is and RPG with turn based strategy and puzzles. Puzzles and RPG in my opinion just do not translate well on the big screen TV. If Nintendo wanted to market a console game that was for personal gameplay experience it can work but it just doesnt seem like Nintendo would do that if the handheld does it better. ,wiiu,cpx60ex,1,t5_2sjnz

I dont know if it matters to you but the first  DS games are their own trilogy and the next  are the prequel trilogy taking place before the first  games. In terms of progression and features Id recommend playing them in order of release if you want to do them all. Otherwise enjoy!,wiiu,cq54uep,1,t5_2sjnz

3624334,0,t1_cq5c7gt,Ive played single player for a few hours did the board gameish mode unlocked a few characters did online a few times. I could never really find a character I liked. They all seemed pretty unbalanced. I started with Mega Man but he seemed really week closeup. I switched to PacMan and he seemed a lot better. I usually use Pacman and Toon Link now but I guess Im just not that good at the game because it still feels super sloppy and random.,wiiu,cq5eg0m,1,t5_2sjnz
3624518,0,t1_cq55xwk,what? are you saying that not every one will get in and than saying characters like shovel knight have a chance?

The only place on the internet that he is getting any votes is the smash sub and thats because they are voting for whichever dev says they would allow their ip in the game,wiiu,cq5f78q,0,t5_2sjnz
3624644,0,t1_cq5beee,Well Nintendo versions of Shovel Knight were planned very early in the kickstarter.Not sure if they were there from the beginning but I think so.In any case it was not a stretch goal. Lots of developers throw console ports in halfway hoping for more funding but that was not the case here.Also this is pure NES nostalgia done right. To me it feels like a game made for Nintendo platforms and ported to others not the other way.,wiiu,cq5fpwj,10,t5_2sjnz

3642425,0,t3_322b2c,Consoles generally seem to be faster than PCs with streamlined operating systems and standardised hardware. With a PC you can play games and browse the internet perform image editing and a heap of other stuff. They need to make an OS to accommodate all of that stuff and because of all the different and strange programs it can bog down your computer. Consoles do like three things play games browse the internet and watch Netflix and nobody can just make a program for it unless you use homebrew. Computers also have heaps different hardware because there are so many kinds. With consoles theres only ever going to be one kind of Wii U or PS or Xbox and they all have the same hardware. That way developers can put lots of effort into making it run as well as possible on one platform instead of making it compatible with all different platforms.,wiiu,cq7gpi0,1,t5_2sjnz

Rosalina and the Lumas stand out as a very maternal creation mythos compared to other stories framing Godhood as more of an ultimate construction job. Being a mother is about providing what is needed for the small and weak to become big and powerful getting them ready to face down a daunting challenge so that would be reflected in the gameplay somehow providing direction to the planets under your care so that they become big complex and interconnected enough to handle Bowser or some other big threat on their own.Thats very vague I know but it thematically fits for this theoretical Rosalina game.,wiiu,cqhpd2z,2,t5_2sjnz

I mean once your NNID is unassociated with the original Wii U how would they know you had already downloaded a game to that one?Of course if you want to sign into the new Wii U using your old NNID youre going to have to contact Nintendo as you can only be signed into one Wii U at a time.

3789736,0,t1_cqo1dp7,The gamepad improves aiming similar to what we see from Wii Remotes. Its a sort of midway point between analog sticks and mouse aiming.Moreover the second display on the gamepad gives a tactical overview and a tactile method to warp to teammates. And if you think the gamepad is just a gimmick you must not be very aware of the industry because Sony Microsoft and Nvidia are just a few who hopped right on board with second screen gaming and off TV play and none of their solutions works as well as the Wii U gamepad.Finally your idea that we could have both is probably a fiction.  fps is widely regarded as necessary to proper aiming and gameplay in modern shooters. It is unlikely that the Wii U could handle  player local multiplayer online and still offer  fps without major graphics downgrades.So noyou cant have both.,wiiu,cqo9dbf,0,t5_2sjnz

That is why VC is too slow as well as the fact that the matches are only  minutes long and youve got major skirmishes that break out and end in  seconds and a hallway can completely change which team its under in less than . Taking the few seconds to describe the situation and then for someone to get there is a lot longer than it takes to see the situation on the map and get there.

Not totally independent but more than luma and the official line at launch was that they didnt make it in because this AI for the second climber would be too much for the DS.  and since sakurai wanted the rosters to be the same across platforms they got taken out of the wiiu version even though there was no limitation there.,wiiu,crl0gff,14,t5_2sjnz

Personally for a game like this Id rather be able to play as soon as possible. Ive had a chance to test it out and I know Im interested. While it is said to have a largerthanexpected solo mode the games main focus is on multiplayer. If the multiplayer is in tact in a form that we can spend a ton of hours enjoyably playing why not release it now so that we can all play as soon as possible?

4121804,0,t3_37ofhf,Some thoughts on why Nintendo did the map  hour rotation and no weapon select during a match.  This is obviously a game you want to play with friends but what about when everyone is at your house for Splatoon party?  This is where map  hour comes in.  You have a group of friends over.  Instead of doing  or  player split screen you do  player online.  You play a match next match hand the controller over to your friend so they can play a match.  The friends who arent playing get to watch the matches and help out by yelling info or cheering or whatever.  Then friend hands it to next friend and the controller makes the rounds.  That way everyone gets to experience the same map a couple times to get used to it without being overburdened by too many complex maps the other players get to learn the layouts before playtime starts and each person would get a couple turns each hour to play since matches are only three minutes long.Weapon select before you even join a lobby I think is a good thing.  There will be numerous unlockable weapons as you advance levels.  If you find you are getting creamed by paint roller a lot it will make you find a weapon in the next match that has shield or can kill paint roller quickly.  It could make the game very unfair for teams if you can change weapons based on what others are using.  Basically in every COD game you can change weapon next time you spawn which helps counter whatever the other guy is using that is wasting you.  In this game you have to learn to adapt to it instead of avoiding the problem.  I think its a good thing actually.,wiiu,crq3zu9,2,t5_2sjnz

4210906,0,t3_393yiq,First some clarifications.A Mii is simply the character you customized to look like your face. It appears on the consoles boot up screen and is used in some games but is not used in Splatoon.Only one Mii at a time and one NNID can be linked to your player account on your console. An NNID is optional for linking to your console player account but necessary for playing online. If youre asking how you sister can play Splatoon under her own account... simply create a console login for her with a Mii that looks like her and then create a NNID account and tie it to her console account.Now she just needs to log into her console account and provide her NNID password then load Splatoon. If youre asking how you can easily swap player profiles between yourself and your sister within Splatoon then the answer is you cannot. The only way to play with more than one person in the room and properly give ingame credit to the appropriate player is to hit the Home button close Splatoon click the face icon in the upper lefthand corner click switch user and then log into the second account and then load Splatoon again.Yeah so if youre handing the gamepad around the room so every person plays one minute game before passing the gamepad then youll be spending half your time logging in and out.Yes this royally sucks for anyone who is not a bachelor who has no friends and it makes utterly no sense for a game console oriented toward family use.Accordingly what is likely happneing is multiple people are playing under the same account... which wreaks havoc with the level and ranking system in the game. It means pros could be tossed in with novices and novices tossed in with pros. Ultimately if a family or group of friends plays long enough novices will be the ones hurting because a Splatoon profile will level up simply by playing regular matches even when playing badly.,wiiu,cs08auj,6,t5_2sjnz

4292977,0,t1_cs9gyob,This. Besides a handful of meh titles in general Sticker Star comes to mind pretty much everything Nintendos released has been gold. The meh titles are only such because they dont capture my interest and arent really fun compared to other games Nintendo makes. But they are still fantastically polished and incredibly ambitious games. And when compared to the rest of the industry.... theres a reason I immediately preordered sticker star but still dont own a PS.As for Wii U stuff the problem is quantity not quality. Im having a hard time calling that Animal Crossing Festival game bad. Its not bad. Its expensive. And honestly? I could see myself having a blast with it. Is it what I expected of a new animal crossing game? Fuck no. Does it look like something Im gonna skip because of price concerns and a weird multiplayer focus on a game that I mostly play alone? Yup. Does that mean it sucks? No! Just look at all that polish on the damn game.Everyones sitting here complain about Star Fox. WHY? Star Fox looks fanfuckingtastic. I literally cant see a single thing to complain about. Perhaps its not multiplayer vs? But we dont know that yet. We literally just got a first look.IMO the real issue isnt the quality of the stuff announced it all looks great honestly. Its the quantity and the lack of major releases which appeal to everyone rather than niche audiences.Nintendos design for their latest creations is indeed ambitious and they are certainly stepping outside of the usual stuff to try something new. And I applaud them for that. Id honestly hate for Nintendo to get stuck in the CoDHalo rehash cycle.I enjoy Nintendo games because they are weird and innovative.

This has immediate serious ramifications as it will indeed deter people from buying a platform that still has  months in its life cycle. Nintendo showed a total lack of confidence in their product which will ultimately lead to a lack of confidence from the market.Had Nintendo shown something big something splashy that was due in say summer to fall . You know like Zelda or Retros big project people could feel more secure in their purchase and basically feel that they werent making a bad investment for that .Now though?

4300124,0,t3_3a69wt,Im actually extremely worried about this game. With the poorlydesigned Chance Shots from the DS game and the frustrating inmatch cutscenes from GCN its looking like the worst of both worlds. I also have no idea what causes Mega Mushrooms to go into play or what they actually do for you  not a good sign. Also not a fan of how the excellent music keeps getting interrupted for the Mega Mushroom theme.Mario Tennis Open DS is easily the worst in the series due to all the missing content. For a sequel to Mario Power Tennis GCN theres no option to disable chance shots no Item Mode no gimmick courts at all !!!! and lackluster minigames and character roster. By the devs own admission it was a bit rushed  its the reason why that game has Luma but not Rosalina  but its worrying that MT Ultra Smash looks happy to just pick up where Mario Tennis Open left off.Things Id like this game to do to inspire confidence in me Better conveyance of what Mega Mushrooms actually do and why you get them. Also make them less frequent or tone down the bloated spectacle when you get one  maybe both. Toggle options for the change shots and Mega Mushrooms. Options in general really. Deepcut characters on the roster. I dont just mean your Birdos and your Wigglers and your Peteys who I want too of course  give me Captain Syrup or Pauline or Wart or Wingo. Or they could acknowledge characters from the RPGs but lets not get too carried away here. ACTUAL GIMMICK COURTS. Here are some free ideas A Diamond City WarioWare course where you play minigames or whatever. A Mario Kart Galaxy course with some weird gravity shit. A course like Ricco Harbor with shifting inplay areas except the the shifting inplay areas are controlled by Beat Blocks. Seriously anything.I loved Mario Power Tennis but after the backtoback letdowns of New Play Control MPT and Mario Tennis Open Im gonna definitely wait for reviews on this one.,wiiu,csacjoj,1,t5_2sjnz

4303533,0,t3_3aa66i,Whats really interesting is that back when Nintendo was first exploring motion controls  before the Wii they had integrated motion controls into the GameCube controller and were experimenting that way. Its amazing that its taken this long to run with that take on the idea. I know Sony has something similar  but Nintendo could probably do a good job with it. Then again  they may fear that Sony could just copy them if they did  but I think thats an acceptable risk  and its a risk thats always going to be there with just about any idea.  Jumping from the now standard kind of controller with motion sensors built into it to a pointer enabled device was a long term mistake in my opinion. Yes  it helped drive Wii sales  but it also forced consumers to choose between this or that  rather than having both. Well  either that or it makes them buy more controllers. Its also greatly complicated backwards compatibility. ,wiiu,csaqed5,3,t5_2sjnz

4315414,0,t1_csbzpba,Id say thats overall all accurate. The one thing though is Kamiyas audience is a bit more spread out between various series and his games tend to scratch an itch that many other games do. While DMC and Bayonetta have their own spice they still provide a similar playing experience to something like Batman. Thus far all of the Xenogames have scratched an itch thats harder to find a really really complex lengthy and amazing story. The stories from Xenogears and Xenosaga rival even the best fantasy and scifi authors. Among RPG fans Xenogears will always come up as one of the best games of all time.Its also hard to estimate what Xenoblades sales would have been. It had so many launch issues in North America and still sold about half a million copies in the region. It was completely sold out and people were forced to buy used copies at inflated prices. DMC by comparison sold . million but was a multiplatform game with unlimited availability that you can still get on Steam for .Its also pretty tough to gauge what the current traditional RPG audience is. Companies seem to think its a dead genre but a lot of them still seem to sell well and the world collectively blew their load at the announcement of an FFVII remake demanding that more FFs be remade. Bravely Default sold well over a million copies Persona  sold nearly a million on Vita and close to the same amount on PS and Square has a new studio for console RPGs.What complicates this even further is that Xenoblade X isnt necessarily a traditional RPG. Traditional RPGs have exploration but the tend to be predominantly linear with side areasquests to explore. If Xenoblade X is truly open world it makes me wonder how much it will actually feel like a traditional RPG and how good the story will be.Regardless its very different from anything currently offered on the Wii U and there are a good amount of people out there that would buy a console just to play a Xenogame. As for how well it will actually sell and how many console sales it will bring definitely really hard to tell.,wiiu,csc2opy,1,t5_2sjnz

The time lapse is awesome too. If youre interested in learning the fundamentals of drawing and paintings this is a super fun way to get started.

4599208,0,t1_cta9tjv,The problem is that Nintendo can only make so many games on their own. Heck they got Platinum to help them with Starfox. This is what the lack of rd party support does. It makes it harder to release big games consistently.So I wouldnt say that theyve been neglecting the Wii U as much as Id say they just cant support it all by themselves no matter how much they want to.So since Nintendo said that they wont talk about NX until next year Id expect NX to come out in  or . But I suspect that it will be backwards compatible and that Wii U support will continue for several years after NX comes out albeit in a small way Im sure.I think the best thing they could do for NX is to get rd parties on board somehow.

And then do that same cycle two or three times in a match?Just everything about their behaviour screamed bot.,wiiu,ctbx8la,-4,t5_2sjnz

4645742,0,t3_3ek8rh,SplatoonNintendo finally takes a shoot at a shooter game and we are given a fantastic and unique game called Splatoon. While the game does have a rather short single player campaign the real meat of it comes from the multiplayer and I have already dumped well over a hundred hours into it. Awesome weapons good music tight gamplay and Nintendos polish makes this an incredible game. The focus on territory control is what really makes this a unique experience to any rd person shooter that ive played with the goal being trying to cover more ground than your opponent rather than the typical Team Deathmatch type game but just because the goal is to cover more ground there is more than enough reason to splat kill the other players during a match. Contributing to the territory control focus is the Squid Form which has players hiding swimming and darting through their colored ink which adds a good bit of depth to what might look like a simplistic shooter. Throw in a wide variety of weapons side weapons and specials and there is a lot to keep each match a different interesting experience.  The game isnt without some faults though the map rotation while I dont mind may put players off a bit with being able to only play  maps different for either ranked or normal play though for about  hours before a new rotation comes up. Also I feel as though there should be a loadout feature which would allow you to create and save a loadout of gearweapons to use for the convenience of quickly changing what gear you go to battle with. Speaking of changing weapons my number one issue is having to back out of a lobby to change gear its an odd decision that I hope gets addressed in the future. Faults aside this has quickly become one of my favorite games on the console and one I am sure I will put hundreds of hours into. Nintendo has a big winner on its hands here and any Wii U owner should check it out its a damn good game.,wiiu,ctg5rxw,1,t5_2sjnz

Dont even bother defending EA they just pump out the same crap each year. COD barely changes it just changes its skin and adds a couple features each time. Everything has been done before. No one innovates or changes things up. They make another modern war shooter or another open world exploration game or another puzzle platformer or another D fighter. Everything has been done to death its the same shit over and over. Every once in a while youll get something that switches up the formula like Splatoon which made the aim to shoot the ground instead of people but even thats the  billionth online multiplayer shooter weve had in the last year.

Alternatively you could keep the money in your wallet thereby slightly postponing the next time you have to make a withdrawal from your account.Or you could just spend the money on chocolate instead of the dlc its your money after all I cant tell you what to do with it.,wiiu,cv2h041,5,t5_2sjnz

5175915,0,t1_cv9b0y4,Nintendo did outsource GBA emulation to M and they did a superb job. If Nintendo contracted M to handle the entire Virtual Console for NX to M Id be more than happy.The original Wii VC didnt have the brightness issues and far more acceptable input lag. Nintendo just did a rush job on Wii U and people bitch about it rightfully so.As for investment Nintendo is incredibly solvent the money they use for game development doesnt need to be contested to engage in other projects. They could buy a few more baseball teams if they wanted and it wouldnt effect their ability to make games at all. Nintendos commodities are time and staff which outsourcing to M would consume neither of.All that would matter is whether outsourcing the VC would be profitable and right now I doubt the VC is profitable or at least not enough to pull staff away from other projects hence why Nintendo periodically abandons the VC. But that is circular reasoning. It doesnt sell well because it is a subpar service. If they actually did things properly cross buysave good emulation etc and made it accessible think a  streaming box in the NX family that can play emulators itd do really well. Not to mention doing it properly would mean theyd have a portable emulation core that could basically be used forever.The NX will obviously need new software to succeed but it also needs to be a value proposition and including some Virtual Console credit would be an easy way to establish that.The Wii U is mostly owned by fairly devout Nintendo fans but just reading threads like this you can see quite a few people are considering passing on NX. Nintendo has a steep climb ahead and they cant afford to lose the customers they have left. Plus the Wii U was a box focused around  games and it didnt get them far the Wii U needs that and more and this is a nice easy way to add more.,wiiu,cv9vz7v,1,t5_2sjnz

5690045,0,t3_3t153e,Ive been a pretty big fan of FZero ever since the I first time I played it on a Super Famicom a local Mom and Pop video store had for rent nearly a year before the SNES was released. Following the series up to the GamecubeArcade release I can see why Nintendo has been a little reluctant to make another. As Miyamoto states  they dont really have an idea as to what to do with the series. You cant really ad weapons because then all you have is a high speed Mario kart. So what do you do?Add height controls using the second analog stickHave the player constantly have to adjust their hover height as they zoom around the track to fit perfectly through obstacle walls that have various holes at different heights. Start off with big forgiving tunnels at first but then progress to smaller branching holes that lead to different paths.Add player triggered environmental changes I guess this is a bit like Mario Kart but have the player trip switches on the track that transform the raceway either ahead or behind them invoking temporary hazards or dead ends that force dangerous detours.Maybe slow it down a bitI found that the last game really made it hard for new comers to enjoy it was just too fast. I love speed but when you cant even enjoy the visuals its simply wasted and lost on the user. Speed should be conveyed through better visual cues and motion blurring. Its like that Sonic problem they want him to go fast but you quickly reach a point when youve lost all control. A simple solution would be to just increase the track size and width so that the speeds can still be attained without the pinball bouncing off the walls effect. Maybe the crafts are equipped with a new kind of shield that dampens this effect by slowing the player down slightly before the crash into the walls. Although I still would like the wall to penetrate the shield to the point where you can scratch the craft and see sparks fly. But should your shields be completely depleted you should crash and burn like any other FZero game before it.,wiiu,cx2elqy,-2,t5_2sjnz
5692771,0,t1_cx220o6,Namco puts Tales on PS platforms because thats where they sell in Japan. When Vesperia is put on  and sells K and then sells twice as much on PS and similar things happened with Graces F w Wii vs. PS Namco decided to go back to their PS fanbase. However they dont like doing multiplatform releases and thus the games get localized on PS. Ideally I think that the best route for the West is to go multiplatfom PSWii U would have been easy for most companies but for we reason the Tales team wouldnt do it rest of Namco Bandai releases games on Wii U relatively often in Japan. At least theyre doing Tales on PC now so that makes me a little happy.,wiiu,cx2qs80,3,t5_2sjnz

WTF is wrong with you guys?  The Legend of Zelda franchise changes mechanics very regularly and reboot the story without a direct continuation of lore that occurs in the game itself.

I say licenses because you dont legally own games purchased in the eShop nor any other digital products you buy elsewhere.So yeah between ownership rights and the Wii Us tiny hard drive you should consider only buying physical discs... unless the convenience really is that important to you.

6112250,0,t3_3z9p70,The first twothirds or so of Sonic Lost World is almost as good as Sonic Generations but the final stretch really annoyed me.  One of the late boss weakness is really poorly telegraphed. He shields and you are suppose to either homing attack or ground pound him multiple times but it doesnt look like you should be able to do that and he counters you earlier if you try to do it to him.  Keep an eye out for a used version that has a preorder bonus with a NiGHTS themed boss rush in it. They never put it on the eshop for late adopters to buy.Sonic Allstar Racing Transformed is a good alternative to Mario Kart it has more balanced items in exchange for Karts that feel less comfortable to control.  The WiiU version also has a few minor graphical glitches. Samba de Amigos track has a normally invisible giant character clipping through the skybox of a section of track shes not suppose to be seen in.Sonic Boom is a dumpster fire.Why didnt they port Generations to the WiiU  that game was awesome!,wiiu,cykeess,6,t5_2sjnz

The second tech was rude right off the bat to the point that I wished I could just do it all online.So again it was the stuck disc then the computer problems the phone cutoff then the rude tech with everything prior that had me at the end of my rope yet I was still polite if a little impatient at the end.  Nowhere was I flat out an ass about anything.All of that together made for a bad experience.

6402062,0,t3_438urs,I think the NX will more than likely be backwards compatible with the Wii U. I dont think itll come with the gamepad but without the gamepad the Wii U hardware costs like  for Nintendo to make tops. They can easily stick one of those in there and let it sync with the gamepad for Wii U owners and have a market for gamepads for those that didnt get the Wii U but want to be able to play the games on the NX.I do think this will likely be the gen that Nintendo starts to make its franchises continually produced throughout the consoles life. Think MK and SmashU but DLC and new characters at a more rapid pace for the lifetime of the console for each game over the course of  or so years. Its somewhat of a waste to do otherwise. Everybody wants more characters in smash. Why not just keep them coming and bank on it the entire gen? Maybe even thereafter.,wiiu,czhclrz,1,t5_2sjnz

Thats not an afterthought unless its being released right at Christmas. Sure before Black Friday would have been better but they gave it time.Nintendo also released a lot of marketing to fans on this game.

6644362,0,t3_46ntmn,. I have component cables plugged into an RCA to . mm audio heaphone plug and have it connected to my monitor. You have options like that even if its not the most convenient thing to set up.. Depends. Generally youre going to pay full retail price on the eShop. Some games like the indie titles are download only through the eShop. On others you may save a few bucks on Amazon but Nintendos first party titles hold their price for years. For the occasional third party game you will save a lot of money over the eShop by buying the disc on Amazon.. Once you have the external hard drive plugged in its pretty easy from there. The Wii U insists on formatting the disc so the drive will have to be dedicated for the Wii U. After that the Wii U will simply put games and saves on the external drive once the internal storage fills up.,wiiu,d06l225,2,t5_2sjnz

If you can only give feedback after a game is out that feedback wont be very useful if you have a significant problem with the game.People had reasonable complaints about Star Fox Nintendo took those on board and we end up with a game that everyone will be happier with.What matter is just making informed criticism instead of kneejerk reactions. If you take a look at the new Paper Mario trailer there are many indications that it might have some design issues that people wont like. Nobody has played it yet but I think people are right to be skeptical.The problem is when people talk out of their ass and make stupid assumptions like many did with Federation Force.

6937360,0,t1_d10s6yr,Sucks even more that rd parties have a tendency to play the game Sega started way back in trying to appeal to tweens by having M ratings and such. Not that there arent plenty of wonderful M games  Im sure Dark Souls is probably M and if its not then someone should be shot  or adults like myself dont enjoy them. But based on the amount of little kids I know theyre still highly drawn to the thought of playing something mature or grown up in the form of blood and guns and such and take the rating of a game seriously as to whether or not theyre interested in playing it. PS and XBox One rock that market way harder than Nintendo not that Wii U didnt get an initial run of lots of M games from rd parties. Billing yourself as mature is itself a marketing tactic that works well at the moment and has since Sega kicked it off before it turned into the mobile licensing company that made Sonic ironically spinning him now to be the blue Mario when he only ever mattered as the antiMario. He was the Mario that smoked pot and your parents werent supposed to like which when youre a kid makes him the coolest thing ever.Im a grown ass man. I never ever think of the rating of a game or take any of the ratings boards seriously outside of their involvement with products Im involved with. If someone mentions a rating it wooshes over my head as whatever.

But of Course if you used the Fire Emblem amiibo on a game like Mario Maker or Yoshis Woolly World the amiibo will give you a neat skin of that character to use for the game. No where in the Smash section of the site says that buying an Amiibo will result in you unlocking that character. ,wiiu,d1q1qvq,3,t5_2sjnz

I clicked During Regular Use and flashing blue light and it only says to call them. When I called them they said to send it in for repair. Im fairly certain my console wasnt simply overheated and I did everything I could to help it recover without taking it apart. But its still bricked.

7349364,0,t1_d2djqk9,gtI think the problem is that its exactly the same as the original game with updated graphics but no new mechanics of note.It... Really isnt though. The levels have some similar areas but really they mostly just have the same motifs. Even the first level alone changes up a lot with a similar intro that quickly shifts into entirely new layouts and enemies and a completely different ending and boss. And on my current playthrough most of the areas have been completely new. So I really dont get how people are complaining that its the same game.And the new controls are actually a really important mechanic. Being able to aim in a different direction than youre moving is a big help in shooting down more enemies and getting a higher score. The Walker isnt a bad addition either though it takes a little more getting used to controlwise. But the Gyrowing is pretty meh.I personally didnt have a lot of trouble with the controls though. You pick up pretty quickly when youre supposed to look where and the motion controls are very fluid and surprisingly accurate. I only wish the game had more onrail segments so far.Edit OP deleted their post. I tried to give context.,wiiu,d2dkm8e,5,t5_2sjnz

Quite the opposite as it indicates either an unwillingness or inability to read the other persons statement.Anyway.I would disagree with your fundamental assumption that rail shooter is a genre. Its not. The genre is flightcombat. Placing the player on rails is no more than a trick to provide more cinematic or visually pleasing experiences for the player which is why onrails segments pretty much disappeared from games decades agotheir affects are better replicated by modern tech or QTEs.Railshooting is a very obsolete technique and has been for quite some time. Making a flight combat game with onrails segments was already embarassing back when Starfox  came out and its just as embarassing now. Also the supersmall environments that forcibly turn your aircraft around if you move even the slightest bit away from the combat zone? Yeah thats just as hard to justify in a  games as the onrails bits.,wiiu,d2gx979,0,t5_2sjnz

Hell even Mario Bros U is fun. Smash was super meh. Especially with all the BS with the  bundle for the controlleradaptergame. Yes I bought WWHD and TPHD.  I even enjoyed playing those again. But at the end of the day for the amount of money I sunk into this console I do not feel like I got my moneys worth. Its sad to say but the most fun I had with the WiiU was playing Rayman Legends.

7455483,0,t3_4hch62,For the Wii U generation they needed to rapidly expand the size and number of their development teams to make up for the lack of thirdparty support. They contracted the help of thirdparty developers like Platinum Games for Star Fox Zero but they shouldve been building their own teams to accelerate their development times and expand the number of big projects that they had concurrently. Especially as they began their NX development.It never helped that they often made divisive choices in their titles that turnedoff fans like Star Fox Zeros motion controls was an unnecessarily risky design choice that displeased a lot of potential customers when the game couldve been designed without motion controls or dualscreens in mind. Instead Id rather wait for Star Fox  to hit the Canadian eShop if ever than buy their  release. Since they cant even do that I might as well just emulate it.The issue being that the library is quite sparse so turningoff fans from one of your flagship releases is a poor decision. Releasing SF as a budget title wouldve probably garnered a lot of sales because it would be a much lowerrisk purchase for consumers if they didnt like it.Nintendo also fails to see that they dont exist in a vacuum. Why would someone buy Star Fox Zero as a fullpriced title when they could buy any number of highprofile games on other platforms that offer far more content? Its apples to oranges but its dollars to dollars and thats why people were going elsewhere. I could buy Doom for PC play the single player play the multiplayer and probably get  hours of fun out of that easily possibly more. Or I could buy SF and hate the controls and play it for three hours. Without a demo SF isnt worth risking my money on. Why would they greenlight a project where consumers would say Its not worth risking my money on.?,wiiu,d2pn3ej,5,t5_2sjnz

7609719,0,t1_d36ccny,I think my point is that I think it has been fully utilized but that the full potential of the Gamepad is more underwhelming than we initially hoped. At its best its a really fun party game tool. At its worst its just really convenient. But I think usually the Gamepad ends up a convenience rather than something that changed the way we play in a significant meaningful and irreversable way. Most games can go without the Gamepad but are slightly better with it.,wiiu,d376pch,1,t5_2sjnz
7609818,0,t1_d372lj0,I definitely agree that it doesnt seem like they failed with the story it truly seems like they did not even try. Im not really sure what they were going for with that game but whatever it is its not for me.Even a lot of MMOs have better story and gameplay than Xenoblade as well as much bigger worlds that actually have stuff to do in them unlike Mira which is essentially just a giant nature hike. Very rarely you might find a BLADE agent out in the field with a quest but theyre almost invariably fetch quests. Fetch quests in a game where none of the items are labeled and are just the exact same floating blue thing. I had to look up where some of the materials were for the Skell quests because none of the names even make any sense.Anyway Ill be far more cautious from now on if Im going to purchase something from Monolithsoft. They had a really good track record before but I can no longer ignore the possibility of their future games ending up so unbelieveably bland and unremarkable. And for a company with a good track record pure mediocrity really stings. I dont know what happened. They had  years to make the game. What were they doing? Sure the world must have taken a long time to make but why put that much effort into making a world look pretty and then just put nothing in it. Its a game not Alien Arboretum Simulator .,wiiu,d3773xl,1,t5_2sjnz

Its mostly why when most people talk about the gamepad being a gimmick that was never explored properly its still my favourite next gen feature of any console.

7951524,0,t3_4o2vo6,I really hope they do something crazily different again.  I enjoyed Sticker Star so much more than every Mario amp Luigi RPG but thats probably because sticker collecting and trading was a real thing when I was in school and you had to be careful about what you stick your stickers on.  Sticker Star let you use your rare stickers without worrying about wasting them ie you could always find them in the same location or craft them the same way and they tended not to be costly to replace like real stickers.  Even the little details such as how your shiny stickers would shimmer as you moved your DS about showed that they were really into the sticker idea and the various ways you could use them.While Id prefer that I.S. make something more emotional for the Wii U and they just got done with  fullfledged Fire Emblem games and a Fire Emblem SMT crossover on the scale of Chrono Trigger. They deserve to take it easy with whatever experimental ideas are flying around the office.  Paper Mario is their IPplayground in which to do just that and after  serious RPGs Im looking forward to seeing what kind of fun ideas have been brewing behind the scenes that would just not be serious enough for Fire Emblem or IntSyss other franchises.,wiiu,d49trwm,4,t5_2sjnz

Im not saying your opinion of the game is invalid but saying that it has to do with age makes you sound like a child. People complain about the linearity of it but I didnt mind that at all. Sure it was more linear than most others but hardly any of them have been real open world games. And even when you had to backtrack in SS there was always a new section to play through.

8021674,0,t3_4oypgq,As a big fan of the Mega Man series and backer for Mighty No.  I really wanted this to be good and Im really disappointed.I know theres plenty of other D platformers but Mega Man always had unique things going for it. It helped get me interested in robotics and transhumanism as a child. And I always loved the fantasy of getting mechanical power ups in my body.And it was always my favorite Capcom franchise with its cute and anime inspired look it distinguished itself and stood out from other Capcom games which often had a more dark decidedly uncute and often more Western look to themStreet Fighter and Darkstalkers and Okami not included. Ive always been a big fan of Roll since I was a kid. And always wish she got a more heroic role in the series or some other female robot. Thats why I was one of the more enthusiastic Call supporters during the Mighty No.  Kickstarter.But now I fear that my new hope was taken away from me. I channeled all that want for a new Mega Man game and for Roll to star in a leading heroic role. Only for Mighty No.  to turn out to become very little.I guess these desires Ive had will remain unrequited. Ill be lucky to ever get another great Mega Man game much less my desires for an important and heroic Roll.I dont understand why Inafune and IntiCreates would let this happen. Or why Capcom dont think that another Mega Man game would be profitable. When D platformers are still so popular and Nintendo makes millions of dollars on them and is starting to focus their platformers more on D and less on D.With Nintendo I worry that Ill not get to see another Mario  or Mario Galaxy style D game in a long time. But with Capcom I fear I wont get to see another D platformer like Mega Man in a long time.Honestly at this point I just want a nice and fun return to the interesting robotic world of platforming and robotic upgrades that Capcom and Mega Man have been building on these so many years. Funny to think that Rokko chan a free game by a small team of indie developers doing what they did for the love of Mega Man and Mega Man style games made and released the game for free. And did a much better job creating my dream game as a Rock and Roll fan than Capcom or InafuneComcept have any chance of doing.I miss Mega Man games more than ever now. lt,wiiu,d4hpmod,2,t5_2sjnz

8055445,0,t1_d4lhyew,The hardest would probably be the Nintendo Gallery if you dont know what youre doing. There are some photographs Pictographs that you can miss permanently if you dont take the pictures at the right time. For example the only place in the entire game where you can take Tetras picture is in a small portion where youre leading her into Hyrule Castle. This is made easier in a New Save file though since you start the quest with the Deluxe Picto Box allowing you to take Tetras picture in the opening of the game.However there is a lot more characters that you can miss. There is one random Rito named Kogoli that disappears from the game entirely after a certain point. If you dont take his picture before then you can never complete the Gallery. There are several characters like this such as the Big Octos and the Wizzrobe miniboss in the Wind Temple.,wiiu,d4liauz,12,t5_2sjnz

8188675,0,t3_4rfe7w,Imho the wii u bombed for three reasons. . Marketing. The console reveal was incredibly confusing coming off as an accessory to the wii rather than a successor. Having wii in the name didnt help much either. Super wii or Wii  would have support least told people that it was a new stand alone console. . Unnecessary gimmick. Now dont get me wrong I liked the wii u but the big selling point was supposed to be a unique gaming experience exclusive to the wii u. The only game that delivered was star Fox zero and thats very polarizing at best. The wii I had great games but did any of those games really require a motion control touch pad? Not really. I bet all of the games could have worked just as well on a traditional controller. . Hardware specs. I am not saying Nintendo has to enter the graphics wars but the wii u was not that huge of an upgrade over the wii.

8648113,0,t3_4yc0dz,Pokken is made by the folks behind Tekken and draws heavily from the player v player fighting game style. Smash is a different style of gameplay sort of a mix of fighter and beat em up. That said It is normally easy to find Smash even years after it isnt being sold in stores however we dont have historical data to predict how easy it is to obtain Pokken going forward. Not sure if that factors into things for you.,wiiu,d6mmjmw,2,t5_2sjnz

8786245,0,t3_50efbu,WarioWare Touched!Highly RecommendedTime Played About  hours Status CompletedTouched! is by far my favorite game in the WarioWare series. Even as one of the first games I owned for my DS I found that few titles on the system used the touch screen more effectively. There are also Nintendo references galore and an absolutely mindboggling number of microgames. Its addictive to say the least.Affordable Space AdventuresRecommendedTime Played About  hours Status CompletedASA is definitely not for everyone but I enjoyed my time with it well enough and I can definitely commend its unique use of the Gamepad. That said theres no denying that its hard  like really hard especially without any hints in the latter half  though the forgiving checkpoint system mitigates some of the frustration that can occur. I was a little underwhelmed by the ending and I dont think that the game tells as compelling a story as it should particularly with that lackluster ending but if played for the experience and challenge there are definitely good times to be had.Donkey Kong Highly RecommendedTime Played About  hours Status CompletedUntil I got my own hands on it I had heard a lot of mixed things about DK. Personally I loved it. This is Rares trademark excellence through and through with tons of collectibles secrets and enough challenge to keep you invested without making you frustrated. I wouldnt compare it to the platforming perfection that I consider BanjoTooie to be but this is still a truly enjoyable and important piece of both Donkey Kong and Rare history that holds up well even today.Mario Kart DSHighly RecommendedTime Played About  hours Status CompletedIve played most of the Mario Kart games out there and Mario Kart DS is one of the franchises better installments. The track designs are great and the enhanced selection of stats for each characterkart over previous installments transformed the series from here onward. Its a truly great racing game.Paper MarioHighly RecommendedTime Played About  hours for one playthrough over  hours total Status CompletedPaper Mario is easily one of my ten favorite games of all time. Aside from it being a bit on the easy side I really dont have any complaints to throw at it. Its charming it looks great for an N game it controls wonderfully and has one of the catchiest soundtracks youll ever hear. The worlds Mario visits are diverse and colorful the enemy designs range from typical Mario fare to actually quite original and the story is basic but very entertaining thanks to the great writing that has become a staple in the series since. I cant recommend this game enough.,wiiu,d73ycgw,2,t5_2sjnz

Since neither of us speak French for example we didnt realize the language was formal until you just mentioned it. The Japanese translation was done by a friend of mine but the rest were done through different translation companies.Id love to do something like what Lucas Pope did with Papers Please.

Ended up finishing it  by Sunday. The battle mechanics were a lot of fun! During development had you put any thought into having more bosses? Or maybe some kind of endless battle mode? The fights that went on for a long time and that were really involved were definitely my favorites. I know theres that door under the Home revisit that you can pretty much spawn dudes forever but itd be real cool to have some kind of true test to see just how long you can hold out against an endless barrage of enemies. Also any reason why there was only one battle outside of the final boss that had more than four enemies? I was really caught off guard when that happened and the fight was pretty memorable. I guess really what Im saying is I am dying for some kind of Hard Mode. Lastly I just wanted to say the soundtrack for this game was killer.

Then at his wedding when all the grooms men and I tripped and needed to go inside and and get away from the world a bit the wiiu was there. That nostalgic feeling I got growing up just playing games and filling the room with laughter and shit talking has been worth the price of the console many times over.  Its amazing the amount of entertainment I have gotten from it considering the amount of games I actually own.

9358016,0,t1_d925yv6,Id say its a bit more relevant the more I think about it. Like if you have a big TV set up in the living room and just want to play on your bed while some netflix plays in the background or something. And next gen mobile console sounds pretty cool especially if we can play movies and such on it. I spend so much more time in my room in my apartment with my computer than I ever do in the living room to play video games alone. Plus its good if you live with someone else but dont want to disturb by playing in the living room at night or while they have people over or something. It has potential. Id say the main thing bringing it down might be possibly low graphics? as that is a nintendo norm lack of backwards compatibility and if there are enough good games and features.

9366453,0,t3_58t721,Let me preface this with saying I love my Wii U I bought it day one and own nearly  games for it. My Wii U and my PS remain tied for my favorite game consoles. I love them for different reasons and for different games. This is a good idea for Nintendo though to cut out backwards compatibility. The reason being is Im sure as much as we all love the Wii U it doesnt change the fact it did not do well and it did not sell well. A combination of Nintendos childlike and family friendly marketing coming right out after the Wii which suffered from a game drought late in life and didnt appeal to the hardcore market and being named something that sounds like an addon rather than a new console to people and being underpowered and lacking third party game support did it in. This is Nintendos Operation Scorched Earth. They cant detach themselves from something if they are still carrying it Ill keep my Wii U front and center on my stand and still love it and play it regularly with my four friends piled on a couch playing smash and mario party til new ones come out and replaying old favorites Ive come to love. This is a good thing it lets them change the architecture of the system and rebuild both the platform and their brand recognition which is why we saw a trailer full of adults and young adults rather than children and tweens. Im looking forward to the Switch and Ill likely buy it on launch day. Years down the road I will look at it sitting next to my launch day Wii U and next to my launch day Wii and have no regrets at all. Im really excited for the move back to cartridges and Im really excited for a full mobile gaming experience. The attachments open up a new world of customization and possibilities. The future is bright all I hope to see many of you on rNintendoSwitch but Im staying subbed to rWiiU in the meanwhile. ,wiiu,d939jty,1,t5_2sjnz
9366904,0,t3_58t721,Im ok with it especially since there will be remake of the good Wii U games I hope Wii U owners of these games will get a discount it would be nice. I think it also proves that Nintendo learned from it mistakes if they made the system BC then the same flaws would have been there.I just hope the system will be powerful enough Im a bit skeptic about tablet chips but well see and I hope the battery life will be decent. Custom Joy Cons would be awesome too.My last concern is about the nintendo network since the trailer showed the new target is yo people I hope the online will be easier and will have normal features youd expect and not a dumbed down system for kids.,wiiu,d93bltm,1,t5_2sjnz

I usually hate cut scenes in games but not only were the Pikmin  cut scenes excellent they really added to the game play sections.Feel free to gush about it all you want Pikmin  has sold less than m units Mario Party  has sold m and Yoshis Wolly World has sold .m.

9476287,0,t1_d9h4cus,The thing with third party games is that most consumers learned from the Wii that Nintendo consoles probably arent going to scratch the noncasual gaming itch. So everybody bought a PSXbox in addition to their Wii barring the casual gaming types.So like you mention a lot of us already had the third party games. So they didnt sell.One of Nintendos core marketing problems is this Nintendo is for casual gaming perception. Why would I buy Skyrim on the Switch when I already have it for PC or Xbox One in two different variations? Being portable is neat but is it enough?No. The answer is a firm no. The Switch will launch with third party support that will almost immediately die off because the rest of us already have XboxPSPC. Third party exclusives could change that but no developer is going to spend the time and money on a AAA title exclusive to a Nintendo platform with unknown future. Its a poor business decision so well mostly get ports. Again.,wiiu,d9h5ncm,4,t5_2sjnz

What pisses me off is that Nintendo created a lot of hype with false pretenses surrounding BOTWs release date and they likely kept Wii U owners from playing the game not to continue polishing and working on they game but so they could use it to pimp their new hardware.  Its no coincidence that the Wii U version of BOTW is finally ready after all these years just in time for Switchs release.Theyve been using dangling this carrot in front of our faces for literally years and I find it insulting that the reason was because they want me to drop even more money on their gimmicky hardware.,wiiu,dd7op4r,7,t5_2sjnz

HOWEVER the key word is investment which means in this case a return will not come back to you vs so many other investments that would take equal or less  time and money can earn you a lot more.Now if you are very pleased to have a collection for playing for keeping on a shelf for personal satisfaction reasons of any kind then its a cool thing to do.  If you want to spend your time wheeling and dealing to get cheap deals you know go for it. That same time spent towards learning some kind of craft that you can make money from will get you a much better return any day of the year.  And so will decluttering your life investing all your spare cash. That return is the best way to make money. The era of CDs were great for gaming but really killed collecting potential. And emulation has killed collecting and digital libraries make collecting just unappealing for a lot of people. And so demand for a shelf full of CDs of games that can just be emulated will always be stifled demand.,wiiu,ddwnshu,5,t5_2sjnz

This was almost  weeks ago.Now that we are pretty much a week away from release I am assuming it will be either today Thursdays tend to be release days in North America or next week at some point.Though Im not sure why Nintendo hasnt put it up for prepurchase on the Eshop yet? Either they are selling insane amounts in preorder physical copies or they are rushing to get it set up properly because it makes no sense. Wii U owners seeing a digital advertisement on their gamepad would more than likely preorder a digital version and right now Nintendo needs not only great reviews for this title but also really strong first week sales to garner headlines. I know their focus is on the switch and moving those units out is a priority but amazing first week sales numbers for the game on either system is gonna help move Switch units and sell more copies As much as solid reviews will,wiiu,de3pv6l,3,t5_2sjnz

11027145,0,t1_dehwasb,I can plug a laptop into the TV and I can play games on it out and about. Is it a handheld console? No laptops are still considered home gaming.Does the Super Game Boy make the Game Boy a home console? No its still considered a handheld console.Its a pretty vague distinction. Nintendo has stated multiple times that the Switch is their new home console and it fits more as a successor to the Wii U than the DS. Nintendo says its a home console you can take on the go and it ultimately comes down to that. If they were to launch another dedicated handheld console the Switch would be considered more of a home console.,wiiu,dehwhcc,3,t5_2sjnz
11032468,0,t1_deihjtw,gt Can I ask why you recommend the  Gb version over the Gb? Because its not  gb free space. The OS uses  gigs leaving you with  usable. Some games like Breath of the WIld have manadatory installs  gigs for BOTW plus game updatespatches and DLC. That  gigs will disappear fast.gtWhat kind of functionality am I giving up without the gamepadThe console is designed to work around the Gamepad plus there are some gameplay elements in some games that require it.gtwhen you said dont buy digital games is that related to your first two comments?It means some people sell their Wii U with digital games included. However with Nintendo systems digital titles are tied to your Nintendo account not the console. All the seller would need to do is transfer their ID to another device and you lose access to those games. You cant even dispute it with Nintendo because Nintendo does not recognize the transfer of Digital titles to anyone other than the person who bought it. ,wiiu,deii70q,3,t5_2sjnz

11241616,0,t3_60grkm,So I bought this Wii U from Gamestop about a year and a half ago for MarioMaker. I actually had a Wii U not too long after Launch but there just wasnt anything on it I wanted so I sold it. Well I knew the new Zelda would be on its way and I wanted to play Mario Maker so I bought this from Gamestop  GB version supposedly Refurbished. The right shoulder button always kinda stuck but would free up after a few presses and would be fine and since I didnt play it much it didnt bother me. Well here we are Breath of the Wild is out and im playing with the gamepad A LOT. So its starting to bug me. Nintendo wants  to repair it and I would rather put that money toward a switch so I ordered a tri wing screwdriver off of amazon and figured I could see whats causing it to stick myself. Well...here you have it. If I had to guess id say someone got CokeSoda in there somehow...and Gamestop clearly did not clean this out when they Refurbished the unit.

There are tools all free that you can run to help diagnose a disk. DBAN can do a pass scrub of the disk. This will give the drive a good workout and remap any failing sectors. Once the drive has been scrubbed run MHDD to do a surface scan. It gives a nice visual representation of the physical sectors on the disk and will let you plainly see if there are any issues it colorcodes trouble sectors. An optimal disk will have no colored sectors but Ive seen some trustworthy disks show a few greens. Both tools can be ran from a Utilities disc or USB boot drive.

11511438,0,t1_dg0q8fp,Honestly Horizon Zero Dawn does everything well but its not something you get for the narrative alone. Its a game that highlights how best to do the gameplay of an action sandbox adventure game. Its got great varied combat movement feels fluid and rewarding and the characters have a certain quality about them that makes them leap away from uncanny valley more than most. Its more dynamic than the likes of the Far Cry series and its certainly got more attention to world building and background. They do explain the whole tribal culture and robot dinosaur thing too and its pretty well done... a bit contrived but it works as an excuse to have a tribal women fighting robot dinosaurs with a bow. Its FAR more in depth than Zelda thats for sure.Id say its potentially a contender for Game Of The Year. Its polished in all the right places and has no real flaws to speak of. Is it a system seller? Alone not for me but then I refuse to by a system for only one game. Combined with some of the other PS exclusives though and damn. Its certainly in my top  recommended PS games.If you add in The Last Of Us Remastered Infamous Second Son Bloodborne and the Uncharted games and I feel theres plenty of reason to get a PS if you dont already have one even if you game on PC. Horizon Zero Dawn is certainly up there with the other stand out games for the system and theres something about playing on a PS over a PC that I just prefer if Im honest.That said if youve just bought a Wii U look into some of the other titles on Wii U. I highly recommend the Bayonetta games and Super Mario D World is incredible. Theres also the Darksiders games which are pretty good. The first one is coming to Wii U next month as a remastered version for a really low price  if I recall and Darksiders  is already available. Really it depends what you want out of games. What genres interest you etc.Im happy to recommend a few games if you want. Got quite an extensive Wii U and PS collection at this point.,wiiu,dg0tnb2,2,t5_2sjnz

If they dont reduce the frame rate to a factor of your monitorsTVs refresh rate you get stuttering which can be much more jarring than an even albeit lower frame rate.
