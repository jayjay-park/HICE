4590705,0,t1_ct98q8g,Yep. From just left and a bit north of where Google puts the marker on your map.There were a few boaters out there this weekend but about  of people fished from the shore.Its a pretty popular spot around here. Has a good campground plus there are firepits and picnic tables all around the lake so you can camp at any one of those.The scenery isnt much unless you love prairie! But its a little gem of a stocked pond. Also have some great fishing a little farther west at Carolside reservoir. Get trout pike and walleye in there so can be fun to target different species.,FishingAlberta,ct995cc,2,t5_2xrug
