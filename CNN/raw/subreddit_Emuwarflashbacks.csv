8391631,0,t1_d5qgm88,Wanted.  I find it is very different from them.  theres a lot more OC.  i was expecting reaction gifs but this is much better.  there are stories behind the posts.  as for your post it shows a guy before he dies.  i guess the rule should be that if the image is an accepted historical image it is fine.,Emuwarflashbacks,d5qi21j,2,t5_3box8

10251504,0,t3_5mdxo0,Upon hearing the news of the surprise checkpoint the first thing to cross my mind was my coworker Sarah and her previous family ties to the Emu Sympathizers. The Emu involvement during the late s isnt documented by more than stories told to close friends during the Rising of the Neck ceremony which takes place once every decade. Sarah and I graduated from high school together and before our Halloween dance in th grade we skipped out to her barn behind her house. Unfortunately tonight was the night of the ceremony and we waited quietly outside the window to the voices inside. Sarah recognized them as her  family but what she heard made them feel like complete strangers. Treasonous acts against the US in the name of a secret Society of Emu following the Treaty of Paris that would make McCarthyism seem like a necessary evil. We fled once we heard of the plans mentioning her as a possible pawn in future endeavors in the hopes of one day reuniting the Emu to their dominate status over humans or with humans if you are still a supporter of the cause. We never spoke of it again and we kept in touch over the years which lead to her getting a job with me after some anxiety issues that lead to problems with employees at her last job. I hope she is ok. If you have any information on her whereabouts call TALKEMU,Emuwarflashbacks,dc62bre,1,t5_3box8

10762685,0,t1_ddq2yc1,Your old friend Caaw had a way with words always crowing inspirational prose through every battle none of which he managed to achieve descisive or lasting victory in. I can see why you killed him that was one bird who simply couldnt shut up. Worry not. I will make certain that whoever you send at me next will never speak again. And as to my captivity your plan has backfired General. Instead of creating your own monster you have made one for your enemy,Emuwarflashbacks,ddq3aqs,2,t5_3box8
10775498,0,t1_ddqa9jv,Sir Id like to go over the approaches on Townsville again. Something doesnt add up with all of my Abrams units diverted to a single flank.

11251277,0,t1_df7b5sh,Well it makes sense. If you have an agreement that anyone within your country can go to any number of other countries you want an agreement as to who is allowed into that country...we should probably not discuss this while the birds are listening lol. ,Emuwarflashbacks,df7bdjx,1,t5_3box8
