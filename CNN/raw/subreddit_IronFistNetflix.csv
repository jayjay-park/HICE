8751486,0,t1_d6zgb8z,What I suggest they do but too late now since its a done deal but Danny meets up with daredevil and a mysterious black outfit that was Daredevils first iconic black costume somehow gets to him.  He changes a few things and bam it works!,IronFistNetflix,d6zlc8f,1,t5_3g1jf
11226231,0,t1_df43304,It is a complete rip off.  If you have seen the Arrow then you have seen the iron fist already.,IronFistNetflix,df4h95x,-5,t5_3g1jf
11233334,0,t3_60cfwt,The letter is pretty obviously from Luke Cage who is currently in Seagate Prison. Claires experience with the Hand is from Daredevil Season . Hulk is referenced by the crisis management guy who says Rands apology got more views than the green guy obviously the Hulks destruction of Harlem from TIH. The Incident is referenced once or twice. Madam Gao refers to the Devil of Hells Kitchen and the man with unbreakable skin. And yes Joy mentioning an effective PI she hired being great when sober is almost certainly referring to Jessica. Also Hogarth but thats pretty obvious.,IronFistNetflix,df5a7el,2,t5_3g1jf
11236138,0,t1_df58jud,He was corrupt. One of his last lines in the season confirms that he was a dick long before Danny back to the start of Rand.,IronFistNetflix,df5lmtb,6,t5_3g1jf

11252201,0,t1_df7dxxo,Ok yeah that makes more sense then. More like a fight club style organization. Wish they had emphasized that a bit more in the story.,IronFistNetflix,df7f54r,1,t5_3g1jf
11256551,0,t1_df32zea,It gets so much better after the first episode.,IronFistNetflix,df7wvnt,5,t5_3g1jf
11265170,0,t1_df85pyl,Wow.  Cool stuff.  Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Kind of like the Asian version of the Asgardians being the inspiration for Norse Mythology then?,IronFistNetflix,df8w2nt,2,t5_3g1jf

11335577,0,t3_60jaic,So we are now  episodes in and even though there was a few duds this is still much better than what the critics have been reporting. What do you guys think? ep  amp  ,IronFistNetflix,dfgv932,1,t5_3g1jf
11345889,0,t3_61uhiv,Shit... I like it. But fuck me right guys? Im only five episodes in though so in my mind its going to be a roller coaster ride of mayhem from here on out. Ill just make sure Im drunk enough watching that I wont be disappointed.Edit also in my imagination hes going to meet up with cage at some point and theyre going to bro up and reality be damned I refuse to let go of this hope.,IronFistNetflix,dfi1bm0,2,t5_3g1jf
11397239,0,t1_df4h4u2,I think theres a wide range of personalities and an even greater range of responses to crashing in a private plane in the Himalayas at  years old only to outlive your parents and be saved by monkdrillsergeants and trained for  years.The likelihood that anyone commenting here comprehends what this would be like and how Danny wouldshould process it is a bit of a reach.Even so as difficult as it is to watch his performance sometimes perhaps Dannys character is portrayed exactly the way its intended to be portrayed. Perhaps he genuinely believed himself to mostly be ok but in actuality has suppressed everything about the incident and is finding himself in a situation where he must confront things he thought he forgot years ago on a daily basis. Perhaps hes still trying to do the same thing daily suppressing everything and acting like hes the monk hes supposed to be without even processing any of the new emotions and experiences either. Im pretty sure anybody would break down fairly quickly in such a situation with similar coping methods.However I completely agree with your point regarding differences in processing anger as a child vs as an adult in regards to acting. I think Harold or Ward are far better examples of good and occasionally decent acting as far as portraying anger goes.Ward attempts composure until hes nearly a nutcase and Harold is a man devoid of anger but teeming with rage.Far more compelling performances than Dannys imo.,IronFistNetflix,dfnv1ih,1,t5_3g1jf
