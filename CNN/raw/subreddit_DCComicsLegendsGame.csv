It makes the competition much more intense. Also you can beat any top players if they show up as weaker than you. literally ranking is about who spend more...Thus if it is intended or not they wont change anything about it.

10065837,0,t3_5jx1rl,Youve had plenty of time to understand how mobile games work Im not sure why this is so shocking. Youre not entitled to a free game that gives you whatever you want with no limits. People with the willpower and patience will play this game and not pay a single cent. And in a few months or a year theyll have solid teams capable of taking on any events. Those of us with money to spare or with like gambling addictions unfortunately to be honest will spend money to get our teams going faster.Thats it. Theyre not being dishonest or scammy. They need to make money of this free game to keep it going. Of course theyre going to try to tempt you a little bit. Do you yell at the manager at the local grocery store for putting things on sale for  that you didnt need but ended up buying anyway because of the deal?You dont need those characters to play the supergirl event theres others. And you have a week to get them up to par if you like supergirl. And if not then dont worry about it. You can still clear up to the rd or th node with any decent team of  on that list. If this refreshes daily youll get a metric ton of shards just doing the first  levels. This is more than theyve ever given us before and we need to encourage that not yell at them more so they go back to being uncommunicative and locking even more content behind paywalls.

10352397,0,t3_5o8qa4,On my end I think its a good idea to get them to L at least.  Though itll take much longer if DCL retains the system from Oa Under Siege the minimum requirement for those events would be to have certain characters at least at a minimum of L with the net result of having a character at possibly L at the end of the month.Also going for L on particular characters is pretty much the way to go with or without completing the roster in mind.  Most characters become semioptimized with L or L and proper gear then you can leave them off for and work on other characters.On my end I made sure to get Zatanna and GL HJ to L before I started work on GA EA who is currently at stars.

10495194,0,t3_5qao6d,First of all the difficulty is all off. I get one or two  trophy fights every refresh that I can all but auto. I dont lose those ever. I get a single  trophy fight every  refreshes or so. These are more difficult. I tend not to lose them but it sometimes comes very close. Such as my last toon vs. their last toon and it could go . The rest  of the available fights are  trophy fights that are completely unwinnable. Like not even close with opponents at least k power above me. Id get slaughtered in  turns if I tried waste the energy and lose the trophies not to mention the PvP gems  for a win  for a loss. In short there is no reward there to make the risk of trying those  trophy matches. Now Im a purely FP player. I usually sit in Champion  or . Depending on how interested I am in the shard reward that week. I read a few guides. Try to optimize my teams. Currently Im running Cyborg Arrakis Harley SS and Zatanna as my team in PvP usually. Less by choice and more by necessity as those are my highest powered toons. I wouldnt mind getting old broccoli head involved but I missed the boat on him a bit and hes  and underleveled at best. I understand that the reason I get so many  trophy matches per refresh is that Im in a higher league than I should be but I say all this to make a point. For me to start attacking those  trophy matches in PvP I need a reason to do so. Otherwise the math doesnt work out. So maybe you tie the number of PvP gems I get to the number of trophies the match is worth. So I get a base number of PvP gems for starting the fight and bonus ones if its a tough fight but no bonus if its an easy one. Maybe you lock down the trophy numbers so I always get  matches of  trophies  of  and  of  per refresh. Right now I only get  or  cleared each time  not much reason to push for clearing. As far as trophy loss goes. As soon as I pushed to champion  the number of attacks against me went from  a day to  an hour. I understand Im in a more competitive tier now and Im the little  trophy fish so Im going to get hit more thats fine. But if others were offered more  trophy opponents maybe Id not get hit as often as Im not the only option. This got rambling on a bit more than I intended. Sorry. Last thing just let us choose our defense team please? I like using Cyborg for offense but i have to take him out if Im auto attacking. He invariably uses his charged cannon before is triangulating blast therefore missing out on an instant kill in many cases and crippling his own usefulness. Fix the AI or let me pick who defends me. Really last thing replays of PvP please? I want to learn from how others beat me see what Im missing. Where I need to get better. Right now its like throwing darts in the dark. ,DCComicsLegendsGame,dcxqo4r,4,t5_39bi0

10809201,0,t1_ddu26bs,Having a lot of stars gives your team a high power rating giving you a false impression that your team is so much stronger than an opponent team with higher gear but lower star count.  Moreover it looks like superpower rating has little or no effect on power rating so the opponents superpowers might have been much stronger than yours and you wouldnt know it.ampnbspLets not forget that you cant really judge how good any team is by the way the AI uses them.  So your team could be a killer when you use it but sucks ass when the AI does.ampnbspThe bottom line is that determining victory by power rating alone is a guessing game unless the difference is huge.

10863060,0,t3_5v9zkz,I agree that the game is unwelcoming to new players. Everything is geared towards level  and up players. The good news? It takes like... A month of daily playing to get there. When you do you should have about a  star team which is enough to L that months  day challenge char. Netting you a legend. Youll also come into some legendary arena chars and be able to start aquiring gear and skill materials and your team will catch up quickly. I started early December. I got frustrated and almost uninstalled the game at one point. But by mid January Id reached a point where I could one maybe  big PvP packs a day Id started farming specific characters I liked making progress towards Arkiss Chummuck who I ended up getting to L. Now after  months Ive got enough shards to L Robinno thanks Im level  and in the progress of finishing my teams gears and skills. I dont have a lot of rare characters but I have  legendary characters to pick from if I want to build a new PvP team. That frustration and feeling normal being behind is pretty much gone at this point. Now Im just bummed about how long I have to wait for legendary Grundy At some point well need some kind of catch up system for new players but right now newbies just need to put their nose down and grind for a while.

I didnt try for Robin in Feb and I would not make so many for Siren in Mar I dont think. Feasibly I would be able to clear up to node  in the events with my characters being available which would at most net me  shards per event with both events and login I would have enough to L Siren with a total of  shards obtainable. so it is possible for an L character on the second month in if you get lucky with your roster being usable.While an L character is perfectly usable for your roster the downside of the energy expenditure may be a heavy burden on you main story team as you will miss out on a lot of farming this way. however the lower nodes are a low energy count I think  for first  nodes. and because you will not need to do them every daycomplete all  nodes day  days  complete node amp second challenge complete node  on day  and days  node  and twice node ...this should get you to exactly L at the end of the month assuming that the drops dont change...again.,DCComicsLegendsGame,dedgzuo,1,t5_39bi0

11217649,0,t1_df3hols,Its not necessarily a set turn order its a initial turn meter manipulation to promote  give extra chance for a certain order.

So in the extreme case of the  fastest vs. the  slowest it would be possiblelikely for one or  fast chars to have their turn sooner.But yes thats another great counterexample we dont want the meta changing from the speediest chars to the slowest chars.No worries Im just trying to get some ideas out there and gauge what people think.

11254374,0,t3_60lq9y,So the takeaway for me here is CA GA is S tier in nearly every competitive PvP comp that not actively trying to avoid bringing him on for flavor reasons.  Both the fact that he is gated behind PVP pack RNG and was already a PvP reward pls correct me if my information is incorrect is pretty disheartening to me as a player who got a late start in this game.  As you stated in your original post not having him gearedskilled could be easily debated as a disadvantage as highlighted by the fact that your from dependence springs diversity still puts him in every theorycrafted team comp Save only for the additional requirement of cheetah.  Isnt this how folks are using him anyway?  Pick  and pop him on to balance the other teams inevitable castaway?If I say that a nerf to either arrow is needed Id venture a guess that Id be downvoted and sent to the bottom.  This isnt a cry for a nerf though but hope that as the game matures an expanded roster will help shake up the current turn max PvP experience that Ive seen posted here.  That being said aquaman was originally touted as a metakiller and slid behind a paywall when introduced remember those threads?? The jury is still out on that claim but I bring it up to highlight that WB probably does look at the patterns that develop in high ranked play.  My Question is are they looking to balance it or turn a profit from it.

11262258,0,t1_df8f0cj,Because in PvP the competitive heroes come in at L.   heroes at L or R are worthless for PvP. Example Supergirl at L gets boulder str up and leader ability. Her Boulder is devistating defense solid and if she gets crit she hits even harder. Example  Arkkis gets debuff immunity death immunity and counter attack buffed to the point he rampages the enemy team specially called with GLHJ.Example  recently Mera gets  key abilities. One being her turn meter up for mends two being her extra end buffs and lastly immunity from damage on her heal.

Im sure some team can beat it but in my experience the team I mentioned gave me all I could handle and more.

11472624,0,t3_63n28e,Huzzah!  More Chemo retooling suggestions!  Hopefully with all our suggestions the devs will see that there really is a lot of room for improvement without breaking the character.Enjoying the suggestions but what with his really low speed Id think it wouldnt be too much to give all his actions a little bit more oomph when his turn comes around kind of like Grundy and Sinestro who take forever to come around but do some beastly things when they do get a turn.Youve seen all my old ones really but I hope you dont mind that I throw in a little bit more oomph per move without eventually just rehashing my suggestions from my first two previous postsChem Trail Id suggest that the Mend buffs be unconditional.   mends whenever he gets a turn would be helpful but not broken in a slow character as mends only trigger every time he gets a turn.Legendary  make it unconditional as well.  What with some characters getting two turns before Chemo gets one again it doesnt seem broken even when Chemo ends up in a onlast vatoftoxicsludge standing situations.Toxic Spill Id make it apply  bleeds on all enemies with a  chance to add  additional bleeds on all enemies.  I dont think its broken to give him the chance to do  true damage to opponents when most other characters deal a whole lot more damage than that when they get a turn.  As to the  proc rate its the equivalent of GA CAs AoEs proc rate.  And as we know when GA CAs AoE procs it does some massive control for the player while still providing a chance for a  nope moment where a team may end up losing because it didnt proc when a player needed it to.  Id have suggested making it a  chance for  Bleeds but the fact that theyre perma bleeds would be too much even for me I think.Legendary  Love that how you gave him taunt as it synergizes well with Corrosive Anatomy making his passive a lot more relevant.  Though Id suggest giving it a little bit of extra push and so that we dont have to go into fiddling with his stats either Make the Taunt last for  turns  chance to Enrage enemies with bleed this way we stick to the theme of ingame Chemo being an undervalued control character I note that or Gain Stamina Up always equal to half the number of Bleed on all enemies rounded down Gain Mend always equal to the number of Bleed on enemies rounded down for a chance of  to  Mends on Chemo depending on the number of enemies are still on the map when he gets to use this  by the time Chemo moves there might just be  or  enemies left on the field making this a move thats only maximized when there are  enemies on the field.  That and Chemo does not get the instant bonus from this as he would have to survive till his next turn to top up massively with the Mends hes received.Personally I like the idea of letting him have the ability to gain massive amounts of Stamina Up or Mends because it really reflects how difficult it is to deal with him in the comics as well as reflects his undying nature.  Id think Mends though would be good without being broken since Chemo would still have to reach his next turn.  Stamina up has instant benefit which is why even I made it just half the total number of bleeds.FalloutYay someone else pushing for a new Trigger Bleeds mechanic!No suggestions really for this.  Trigger Bleed in itself is something Ive really been pushing for.Corrosive Anatomy Id suggest making it  the magical GA CA number chance to apply  Bleed  Str Down  turns  Int Down  turns and  Agi Down  turns whenever an enemy hits him.Legendary  since I already placed bleed with the rest on the base ability make the debuffs Always.Cancer always wins even if you beat it.,DCComicsLegendsGame,dfwf0gj,1,t5_39bi0
