2024159,0,t3_2hwtmc,I cant give any direct advice but if you have an account at Devex you could probably reach out to someone on there.  Alternatively and I always rolled my eyes at my career advisers that told me to do this a LinkedIn search international development water issues etc. for whatever region youre interested in could match you with people you could contact with.  You could also look at larger established development orgs and NGOs for people to reach out to or perhaps partner orgs of the WHO and UN  Water.  Here is a link to the UNWater partners webpage  All this is really broad but I hope some of it helps.  Good luck.,InternationalDev,ckx43ny,1,t5_2wm61
8769098,0,t3_506wgo,Ive been in the same situation as you having settled on doing a post grad at SOAS in Anthro of ID which I start soon. Theres such a spread of choices out there and its hard to work out which would be best. I also applied to PGs at the University of Amsterdam Sussex anthro of ID again Birmingham straight ID Nottingham llm in international law and development Bradford straight ID and East Anglia straight ID. During my research into different courses I also saw there were some cool pgs in peace studies and other subjects like it that are run by multiple unis which could see you spending a term at Maastricht  Venice Amsterdam etc. Theres also a graduate school in Geneva that does ID though it might not suit since they have strong ties to UN agencies.Sussex looks great and is incredibly well regarded and I would love to do a PhD there but I opted for SOAS for my masters as it seems to offer more for me right now. To get onto the PhD track with a chance of getting esrc funding at Sussex you are required to do an additional Msc in social research methods. ,InternationalDev,d71sv58,2,t5_2wm61
