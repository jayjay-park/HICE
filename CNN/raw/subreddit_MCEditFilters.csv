3251950,0,t1_coz2g3m,Brilliant! Thank you!In the lines that start with schematic. are the box.minx box.miny etc x etc. are those referring to the coordinates in the level or the schematic?  As I understand the basic structure of this code it is essentially saving the schematic based on the calculated locations FROM THE SELECTION BOX. However it is not updating the actual level. Correct? Finally what does that first line mean?P.S. I would give you crazy amounts of reddit gold if I wasnt trying to pay for college lol.,MCEditFilters,coz2otk,1,t5_30996
