The Vikings more martial take on Christianity empowers them to move eastward subduing the nomadic peoples of Eastern Europe. The Huns Scythians and Avars have no choice but to move south. The Eastern Roman Empire falls first while Western Rome survives until the Arabs move north from Sicily in the th century. Stymied by the Alps and Pyrenees the Arabs attempt to convert the various mountain tribes that now inhabit Asia Minor. They succeed in the east but come up against Medieval Greek citystates who manage to keep the Arabs out evoking past legends of their victories against the Persians. There are three centres of Christianity Stockholm to the North Constantinople to the East and Avignon to the West.

1027144,0,t1_chl1j7m,ampampampSection . First national flag The Stars and Bars of article  Flags of the Confederate States of America sfw gtgtThe first official national flag of the Confederacy often called the Stars and Bars was flown from March   to May  . Inspired by Austrias national flag it was designed by Prussian artist Nicola Marschall in Marion Alabama   The Stars and Bars flag was adopted March   in Montgomery Alabama and raised over the dome of that first Confederate capitol. Marschall also designed the Confederate Army uniform. gtOne of the first acts of the Provisional Confederate Congress was to create the Committee on the Flag and Seal chaired by William Porcher Miles of South Carolina The committee asked the public to submit thoughts and ideas on the topic and was as historian John M. Coski puts it overwhelmed by requests not to abandon the old flag of the United States Miles had already designed a flag that would later become the Confederate battle flag and he favored his flag over the Stars and Bars proposal. But given the popular support for a flag similar to the U.S. flag the Stars and Stripes the Stars and Bars design was approved by the committee.  When war broke out the Stars and Bars caused confusion on the battlefield because of its similarity to the U.S. flag which was used by the U.S. Army exacerbated by the fact that some Confederate units still wore dark blue coats early in the war prior to the adoption of gray uniforms. gtHowever the flag received criticism on ideological grounds for its aesthetic resemblance to the U.S. flag. As early as April  a month after the flags adoption some were already criticizing the flag calling it a servile imitation and a detested parody of the U.S. flag.  In January  George William Bagby writing for the Southern Literary Messenger wrote that many Confederates disliked the flag. Every body wants a new Confederate flag Bagby wrote also stating that The present one is universally hated. It resembles the Yankee flag and that is enough to make it unutterably detestable. The editor of the Charleston Mercury expressed similar a view stating that It seems to be generally agreed that the Stars and Bars will never do for us. They resemble too closely the dishonored Flag of Yankee Doodle  we imagine that the Battle Flag will become the Southern Flag by popular acclaim. In addition the editor of the Savannah Morning News also objected to the flag on account of its resemblance to that of the abolition despotism against which we are fighting.  gtInteresting American Civil War | Confederate States of America | Bonnie Blue Flag | South Carolina Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchljcl oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechljcl.

The emblem from the Georgia flag was modified removing the circle of stars and only keeping three at the top representing the three former states.It may not have a equal representation of emblems from each state but I think that would clutter the design.

2383971,0,t1_cm5stx0,gt Seals are generally for a corporation of some sort like a government or business.A seal is exactly what its name implies a device for sealing correspondence with an imprint of its originator in order to verify its authenticity. In other words its the traditional version of a cryptographic public key.  Theres nothing particularly institutional about them though individuals can and do have their own seals.A seal can include a coat of arms or any other image or design that identifies its owner but the one thing that a seal shouldnt depend on is color since seals work by making embossed impressions  traditionally in wax but in modern times also directly onto paper documents  theres no way to actually convey color when a seal is used to make a physical imprint apart from using crosshatching but that can be difficult to implement.  Thats why seals usually contain designs that are more complex than a simple reproduction of a shield from a coat of arms and often explicitly include identifying text e.g. in a ring around the graphical design.OPs design would look great as the shield of a coat of arms but to function effectively as a seal it actually should include text e.g. The official seal of uWarqer encircling the design.,vexillology,cm6d7y3,1,t5_2rygj

If the GOP is probusiness and against most market regulation and constraints then how does it justify keeping legitimate American business interests out of Cuba considering that our competition in the EU and China are free to do business there?  .

4175951,0,t1_crw06sn,Thats partially true but it was also used by Germans in the Iron Age and by Vikings.  There were four swastikas carved into a bucket found on the Oseberg Ship from about the seventh century.  There is a swastika found on the Snoldolev Stone in Denmark dating from the ninth century.  Its a very simple and aesthetically pleasing design that anybody can copy with ease and so numerous cultures not only Persians and Vikings but also Slavs the ancient Chinese and various native North American tribes made frequent use of it.  Heinrich Schliemann found one among the ruins of Troy.  Its nearly universal as a symbol although its meaning changes dramatically over various cultures.The NAZIs were pretty bright when it came to fashion and design but their understanding of history linguistics and symbology was deeply flawed arguably the least of their flaws.  They latched onto the Vlkisch movement which tried to find a link between various Aryan and Persiac tribes and modern Germanic peoples.  Their theories are rightly regarded as hogwash but they used some similarities between Viking runes and fragments of text found around the Indian subcontinent as well as the swastika to spuriously support this theory.  So both you and uSilvester are both quite right and a little bit wrong.  Hitler did not choose the symbol for the party he wasnt made leader until  and the symbol was chosen in  but he did design the flag.  In the end the swastika was chosen for both reasons a historical link to German people a historical link to Aryan people and its meaning as interpreted by the Vlkisch.. Dottie Indyke.

He was in Germany to meet some family and was chatting away to this young German couple his sleeve rode up and revealed this tattoo from the camp on seeing this the two became very uncomfortable. When asked they kept saying sorry and became very emotional. They were not involved in the Holocaust there were in no way responsible and had only ever been sweet to this old man they had known for an hour but felt so ashamed and sympathetic they cried... its beautiful.

What about regular gay people who want to have a family of their own? Do you think it is wrong for those people to want to live their view of what family is while supporting the concept of gay pride?gtWhat I mean by it being shoved down our throats or pushed upon us is how everywhere whether it be on television billboards etc. Another goal of the Gay Agenda is to limit free speech. In what way do billboards and TV want to limit free speech? gtJust think of all the tumblrisms and triggering and how that might turn into laws forbidding certain words or phrases.I mean sure but what does that have to do with the concept of gay pride?gt Actually right now in California it is illegal to say the words husband and wife because its offensive. ....

DONT have the legislature choose the candidate  run the competition with a public vote and a panel of flag experts  and then start lobbying. Write to your rep and senator and get other people to write to theirs. Petition the governor. Get newspapers to write about the competition and the winning flag try to get newspaper editors to endorse the idea of changing the flag etc.Note that Pennsylvania has had its lousy flag for over  years  and the last proposed change was to make it worse by putting the word Pennsylvania on it which passed the state House.

For the San Diego Worlds Fair somebody designed a dark blue banner with a tackedon desksize us and crudely embroidered New Mexico   in silver thread. It was about   cm wide and hung down from a stick. I just noticed that one image shows the original state flag on a stubby pole ... this is incorrect. I have seen the thing and its hung from a horizontal stick at the top not flown from a pole or staff.gtOnly one of these was made ... and it hung on the wall of an exhibit hall at the  Worlds Fair in San Diego. In fact it was put together for that exhibit and never actually flew anywhere.so it never flew in New Mexico or anywhere outside of one building in San Diego?,vexillology,cwrsz3n,9,t5_2rygj

It is often anticapitalist in tone and sympathetic towards certain nationalist forms of socialism such as Stalinism and Maoism.National Bolshevism is said to have roots in World War I Germany where nationalist writers such as Ernst Niekisch and Ernst Jnger were prepared to tolerate the spread of communism as long as it took on the clothes of nationalism and abandoned its internationalist mission. This tendency although minor continued into the s when it became associated with the National Socialist Combat Movement a dissident breakaway movement from the Nazi Party which espoused leftwing economics and which was led by Hermann Ehrhardt Otto Strasser and Walther Stennes.The current National Bolshevik Party was founded in  as the National Bolshevik Front an amalgamation of six minor groups. The party has always been led by Eduard Limonov. The groups early policies and actions show some alignment and sympathy with radical nationalist groups but a split occurred in the s which changed this to an extent. Opposed to the Vladimir Putin regime in Russia Limonov has somewhat liberalized the NBP and joined forces with leftist and liberal groups in Garry Kasparovs United Civil Front to fight Putin.,vexillology,cxueqaj,1,t5_2rygj

If you really want to though make sure it has greater contrast from the background. Light colors on dark and vice versa. As for fonts try Trajan. Its based on Roman lettering and looks pretty statesmanlike. Copperplate gothic isnt bad but it definitely needs to be bigger or bolder than that.But really try to make it work without text and your flag will be better off for it.,vexillology,cytdrtn,6,t5_2rygj

6713689,0,t1_d0d9tjp,gt the reason is that red on blue doesnt look good.Many here will already know this but for those who dont....  In European heraldry white and gold were treated separately from the other colours in fact theyre referred to as metals using the terms argent French for silver the metal and the colour and or French for gold the metal and the colour. And one of the general rules in heraldry and later in vexillology was Dont put colour beside colour or metal beside metal. Yes there are flags etc. that break those rules famously the Vatican flag but most national flags and most flags that people say look good continue to follow that rule.  And yes one of the key reasons behind that rule is because very often colour beside colour in the sense excluding white and yellow often looks bad. Consider the flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti I find the bluebesidered thing just doesnt work very well.Anyhow I threw together what the new flag would look like with no stars no white outline on the stars black stars white stars.,vexillology,d0dr4bl,8,t5_2rygj

7267786,0,t1_d23yb6e,I meant that design wise making a crescent with the same color scheme isnt very creative. I tried to at least put something interesting together that would be more recognizable as Sweden via making it look like the current flag. I dont know. Id be fine with rewording my title as uncreative. I actually think the guys flag looks nice. The title doesnt even mention him specifically though just the subreddit he posted it on thedonald. It could also be this one which also got posted there and upvoted which Id say actually is lazy since its from a Google Images result from some page that had made this flag in  way before the memes war started. Many flag memes got posted on thedonald yesterday so I couldnt have been singling out anyone explicitly just the ones with crescents most of them.    As for how much effort I made well these are basically memes dude. I put just as much effort as I think should be put into making good quality memes. Recoloring something on MS Paint seemed like not enough effort for a meme for me but actually rearranging some symbols from existing flags seemed good enough. I mean while the Allahu Akbar and the Shahadah were taken from Shia and Sunni countries I didnt think of them so much as characteristically either one that it would be an immediately glaring mistake on the picture. I know that those types of scripts and the sword are specific the sword stands for the House of Saud but that seemed enough like just a detail that taking the time to find andor make and then import actual appropriate script and sword resources to fix them would be too much work for what is basically a meme specially since the meme had to be made yesterday to still be relevant and it was late at night. Taking resources from existing flags seemed enough like fair game for that purpose.  Also Id made this one with only things from Saudi Arabia so at least that one is consistent.,vexillology,d24ap3k,11,t5_2rygj

7438760,0,t1_d2nh9kz,Yeah the difficulty is... There is no official all Ireland flag as far as Im aware. Political reasons obviously.Id really like to see rvexillology attempt to come up with an all Ireland flag. The Irish rugby hockey and cricket teams to name a few are allIreland and have used variants on this four provinces flag. Football is slightly more political and considerably more divisive. So youll find the north and south will use their national flags and national anthems. The flag of N.Ireland and the union flown and God Save the Queen sung at national football games.Im from Belfast Presbyterian therefore Protestant by religious practice! and will be heading to France to support N.I. in the Euros. But Im also massive fan of Ulster rugby the Irish rugby and Irish cricket team and have friends who play in both. Its all very complicated here regarding the politics and the flags. But political opinions on a united Ireland aside its great to have a world topping rugby team this entire island can get behind. Its just very difficult to see it a  neutral or joint thing all the time when Irish national anthems are sung at the rugby games and the games all happen in Dublin although that ones very understandable.,vexillology,d2nqlxz,2,t5_2rygj

7584615,0,t3_4j7lko,I decided to create a new Communist Britain flag as my last one wasnt received very well. Im going to explain in detail why I chose this design.I chose red because its the color of communism however I made it a slightly darker red than the usual red so it can be more recognizable and unique.I also used white for the things on the flag instead of yellow again to make it more unique whilst still keeping true to communist colors.I didnt use the hammer and sickle as it represents workers and peasants. Britain is a developed country with a fully developed working class and no peasantry. Therefore I feel a hammer and sickle would be a little inappropriate so I instead chose a symbol with two hammers representing the working class. Also I preferred to keep the hammer and sickle out due to its affiliation with the Soviet Union in which this country would not be rather a much more democratic communist state. The three little stars at the bottom represent the three states England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland has reunified with Ireland. The large star at the top represents the revolution. So as a whole the flag represents a workers revolution in the three states of Britain.,vexillology,d34c0vi,1,t5_2rygj

7592913,0,t1_d3531b1,Firstly since english is obviously not your first language Ill give you a little help on that. You should have written  It sounds like a bad design to me says a Kiwi.  That makes more sense doesnt it? And its more accurate because it uses what I actually said in quotes. Also I would not consider myself to be the Kiwi as there are many more New Zealanders that deserve such a grand title before me plus the  actual birds.   Now we can address the connotations behind your statement. I gather that you are insinuating that the flags that were put up for our recent referendum were badly designed and that my being a Kiwi is somehow responsible for this. The first part I totaly agree with as I have stated many times on multiple platforms including this subreddit. I can go into detail for you if you would like?   As for the imaginary tie into these bad designs for merely being a Kiwi I would like to point out that myself and many Kiwis voted against them. This would indicate that a majority did not like the flags either. Given these facts I am not sure that your argument holds much water.,vexillology,d359y4k,1,t5_2rygj

They borrowed it straightup from some archaic variety of Slavic where it also means river mouth.They split the difference with Oldenburg. Thats a translation of its former name Stargard both meaning old city.

On that occaision the flag was broken out by Australian media personality Mike Bailey on behalf of the Irish Week Committee.gtThe flag features the constellation of the Southern Cross taken from Australias National Flag combined with a golden harp a symbol of Ireland since the th century.gtThe winged lady a representation of the Maid of Erin appears inspired by the Southern Cross alluding to the contribution that Irish settlers and their descendants have made to the development of Australia. The maid wears a garland of golden wattle in her hair.gtThe green and gold colours of the flag reflect the links between Australia and Ireland. Green and gold were adopted as Australias National and Bicentennial Colours in April . According to the Vexillological Society of Ireland green and gold are the traditional colours of Eire and are believed to have been first used in the th century as a symbol of the Irish people.gtThe flying of the Irish Australian Flag commemorates over  years of Irish influence on the Australian landscape and lifestyle and denotes the importance of the Irish contribution to the Australian way of life.,vexillology,d673c8r,3,t5_2rygj

8672475,0,t1_d6pngin,First Fascism is based on a core belief of antiliberalism and anticommunism and is very nationalist. Sounds like National Socialism right? The main difference is that the NS movement goes a step further and blames these philosophys and all the other ills of the world on the Jews. Fascism is basically not antijewish and as a matter of fact had many Jewish members including the grand Rabbi of Rome! Additionally while they believe in the ideal of superior leaders rising to the top of government Fascism is not racist.Second in the area of economics Fascism is based on more of a traditional form of socialism whereas National Socialism rejects traditional socialism as being just another Jewish swindle. The main difference is that Fascism is more rooted in an economic form of government while the NS movement is based on race and the folk community. While there clearly were socialist elements in the Third Reich these are actually closer to what we today have in America with things like old age pensions and public health care. National Socialism uses any economic element that will benefit the people of their nation and is neither a left wing nor a right wing movement.,vexillology,d6poioz,-18,t5_2rygj

Ah well I doubt it would have changed much considering the margin of victory. And yeah I didnt expect th at all I am very pleased with that especially considering how many good flags are entered into these competitions. A was trying to go for a similar colour scheme to Macaus flag I had no idea what people would make of it. Overall I wasnt  satisfied with this one either but I didnt really know what else to add.

9523351,0,t3_5bakfh,The actual Brazilian flag has a lot of issues. First of all it has lettering. Tiny green letters which cant be seen at distance. Second too many stars scattered across the circle. Okay its clever use a real night sky in a flag but no one can draw perfectly a Brazilian flag without a giant book of rules. Third and maybe its not a problem per se but i believe that it counts no red on flag. The origin of the name Brazil is the brazilwood a red wood extracted by the Portuguese settlers at  century. So... Where is the red on flag? I think that the name of a nation is a important thing isnt?The flag proposal include the national colors green and yellow and red for brazilwood. It suggests the lozenge shape but in a different way. The flag also resemble a explosion like the spirit of Brazilian people. The immigration is represented by all the lines poiting to the center and the actual Brazilian emigration is also showed in that explosion. Also the green and red cross pays homage to Portuguese colonization colors and Christianity cross.Finally the flag resembles a brazilwood flower ,vexillology,d9mydxd,2,t5_2rygj

10039996,0,t3_5jhmgl,From the sourcegt The flag shows the sun on the horizon behind a layered tower. The colours represent creative energy and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety.,vexillology,dbg8kef,3,t5_2rygj

Nonetheless I think Id still prefer it to an undecorated triband. I could say pretty much the same about the two variants of the modern flag of Spain although the problem with the coat of arms is a bit worse for this Republican flag because it is confined to a smaller area than in the rojigualda modern Spanish flag.By the way I think that the flag would have looked better if the lion representing Len was coloured purple matching the lower band.

Having said that the white ensign did form the basis of quite a few not so official flags for some colonies parts of them and the federation movement.When the Royal Navycivilgovernment split came into effect the colonial navy ships fell in the government category and the first uses of many of the blue government ensigns was in fact for colonial navy ships. This remained the case after federation  the now combined Commonwealth naval forces did use the blue Australian flag as a naval ensign. It was also more generally the government ensign and like the red civil ensign also used on land although in some sense it was still the Union Jack rather than either of these that was the national flag.This lasted until  when the eventual agreement on the relationship between Australian forces and the rest of the Empire resulted in the formation of the RAN using the British White Ensign and the Australian blue flag as a jack.The white ensign in the OP was introduced in .

The above attitudes invariably lead down similar roads to banning antiracist books for using racist words or trying to remove statues of someone who is now perceived to be oppressiveracistwhateverAnd yes I realise most comments are probably flippant which is fair enough!Essentially all Im saying is that because something now appears racist or ignorant unless it was created with that intention or an equivalent lack of understanding it shouldnt be held as such.,vexillology,ddlaabj,20,t5_2rygj

11197236,0,t1_df13ou0,I see what youre saying. But the flag is actually exactly the arms rotated to have horizontal stripes rather than vertical. This is close to the most common use of arms in flags  the banner of arms where the arms are simply put on a flag rather than a shield. In the case of Amsterdam before this flag was adopted there was a tradition of using the arms not in flag form but as a device on the flag. And the device was not only the coat of arms but an armorial achievement including supporters and crest. In this context the switch to something close to a banner of arms is clearly a simplification but rather than abstracting anything in the arms it simply sticks to the basic translation of arms to flag.Obviously part of what Im saying is quibbling about whether coatofarms means just the coat or the achievement as a whole but even apart from that what Amsterdam did is different from anythgin that could be done with the Welsh dragon. The Amsterdam change was ditching the extra elements in the achievement while the dragon is a single element to start with. Any change there would be some sort of extraction  either keeping the whole charge but simplifying its depiction which is not a change at all by heraldic standards or picking out a part of it to represent somehow.Youll notice also that the actual arms of Amsterdam are an example of a coatofarms that is not particularly visually complicated at all. There are plenty of these and plenty more that are more or less complicated depending on the style the elements are drawn in. An armorial achievement is inevitably more complicated than the arms alone and probably only used when you want a complicated look in some sense but even that depends to some extent on the style chosen by the artist.,vexillology,df16yse,4,t5_2rygj

Although they absolutely have an understanding of the notion that Scotland exists.Although Im no authority on Japanese I suspect its a similar story with their language.
