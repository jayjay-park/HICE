6891019,0,t1_d0prc0u,I read your question as What kind of magnet should I buy?I would spend what you could afford to lose. Some days your rope snaps. Others you simply cannot get the magnet to let go.  Or its tangled up in something below the water and you have to cut the rope.I started out with a magnet from Harbor Freight and a sturdy rope. It worked ok. I did recover quite a few knives with it from fishing spots.In the U.S. a hundred kg pull strength translates to  pounds pull strength.  Ive linked to the KJ magnetics catalog page that would have different ones similar to what daypatch is referring to.A  magnet plus  of Polypropylene or Nylon Rope from Home Depot would make for an efficient rig.When I made my drag bar it ran me . Its pictured in the below instructable linked to below.  KJ MagnetsMagnet drag barHTH!,magnetfishing,d0xexvv,1,t5_2yosz
