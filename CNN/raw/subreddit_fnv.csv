22978,0,t1_cegsb38,Every time it says You feel lucky. the games cheating on your behalf.  How often that happens is based on your Luck.  Even a character with Luck  is still a little luckier than a real world gambler.However that also means that even a Luck  character can clean out casinos without too much time and effort by saving before playing and then using basic strategy  That is if your character isnt already so implausibly loaded down in caps that you ought to have a significant stealth penalty.  ,fnv,ceh1sa6,2,t5_2rzr5

1796676,0,t1_cjzwa6r,Some good sniping weapons eh? Well outside Vegas is the ncr place McCarran field. Theres a guy in first recon who uses a cowboy repeater called la longue carabine but I havent gotten that yet so I cant attest to its power. Ratslayer is nice which others have said. Actual sniper rifles are rare in this game considering that I could get four of them and two special ones before level  in fallout . But they are excellent with mods in New Vegas. Gun runners sell them occasionally. Now the heavy hitting ones are all I use on my older playthroughs. The fully modded antimaterial rifle is a sweet piece of ass especially with its mods. It has standard . caliber rounds armor piercing . cal rounds incendiary . cal rounds and my personal favorite deathclaw destroyifying option. Exploding . cal rounds. Yeah. You heard me. The other option is the Bozar. Its basically my favorite gun.  round clip of . rounds Armor Piercing Hollow Point or . rounds. A sweet scope and a surprisingly fast reload. I highly recommend it later in the game when you can afford it. It costs close to  caps. ,fnv,ck5mb90,1,t5_2rzr5
1812744,0,t3_2fahlf,I actually started this today after seeing your last post. SPOILERS The start is really easy leveling sneak then walking straight to Vegas getting in through the monorail lets you bypass the caps requirement. Also you can pick up some mods in Good Springs including a silencer which simplifies conflicts quite a bit. Next Ill level science and speech maybe barter and maybe guns if I have to fight a lot more. Is barter required to bypass Lanius?Im doing the Yes Man story line and stopped at the bunker at Cottonwood Cove. You need  science to be able to turn off the defenses in the bunker so Ill be doing some leveling before moving past that.Also I had to break the rules a bit and punch Benny to death in his suite since they confiscated my rifle and I didnt have the skills leveled to get him to get captured by Caesar.,fnv,ck7m4gf,3,t5_2rzr5

2038979,0,t3_2i54r0,The only problem I see with not playing Fallout  is that you played New Vegas first. In doing so if you were to play FO now it would seem like there were a few things missing. Some can be replaced by mod PC but only to an extent and you would still think your simply playing a watered down version. If you have time and the resources to play it PC is highly recommended. If you dont want to deal with the hassle of going through the game on your own watch a Lets Play I highly recommend a man by the name of Gopher who does amazing videos. There is no need to drop Destiny for FO I just recommend playing Fallout when you have time for it. Try not to wait to long to play it because some people get turned away from it when there are new and better looking games like Destiny to play. TLDR Try watching a lets play if you have no time for it or dont want to put Destiny down.,fnv,ckyzzwz,3,t5_2rzr5

3990715,0,t3_366j40,Id like to note you can and should do this at the very start of the game. Make sure you never leave Goodsprings and fully max out your characterwill take awhile and then save.  Now that save is important cause when you finally leave goodsprings the game will ask you if you one last time to change anything of your characters stats and what not. This save is now  where you can come back and make a new character whether its the ultimate handgun shotgun or melee character. Also due to a glitch the game will actually give you more perks. At the beginning character creation choose better convos with males or females. Then when you leave goodsprings and reconfigure your stats choose the opposite one and you will end up with both. Cant remember too much on this cause its been a long time since Ive done this. Sorry if im wrong here. This is Good for trophy hunters who want to max out there character and breeze through the game as quickly as possible. ,fnv,crb6c54,1,t5_2rzr5

If it isnt there add bAllowConsole then go into your Falloutdefault.ini in your FNV instalation e.g. SteamsteamappscommonFallout New Vegas then doing make sure its in that file and any instance of it is set to .I had that one issue with menu mouse acceleration a couple times and even when I fixed it in the Fallout.ini it would just reset it every time I opened the normal launcher. Eventually I found out that it was because it checks some things against the Falloutdefault.ini and if it isnt the same the launcher will fix the problems with the other INIs. So maybe you are having the same kind of issue maybe check FalloutPrefs.ini as well could be wrong but it seems like it ignores the others for that one sometimes and it has bAllowConsole in it too.,fnv,crbp5qg,3,t5_2rzr5

Perhaps edit the NPC inventory directly in the GECK delete the default outfit and leave them with only the armor you want instead of two outfits.

4395690,0,t1_csl4e8f,Well Ive put  hours into New Vegas on XB with the intention of eventually getting a new PC to play it on as well as FO. I highly suggest giving it a shot. Every mod I listed is available on Nexus Mods. The only huge difference in the game with the mods Ive chosen is the Mutant Mod it adds quite a lot of new very tough enemies. Example I went into Repcon to do the Come Fly With Me mission just as I had time and time again. As soon as I walked through the door I was attacked by something Id never seen before. After Boone and I dispatched the creature two other very tough creatures came bounding in. I jumped on top of the reception desk to get a bit of high ground while Boone charged in on his own. Boone was knocked out within seconds by these things. I wound up spending almost every bit of ammunition I had on me as well as the last of my dynamite just to kill two creatures. It was almost like they were immune to damage. It is exactly what I was looking for as far as something new and interesting to add to my first PC playthrough. It really feels like playing it for the first time. Do it. Mod the game. Share in the glory that is modded FONV!,fnv,csl4oid,3,t5_2rzr5

4903756,0,t1_cuc6k3g,Just a noteWhile it is awkward at first once you get used to no iron sights its really not so bad.I would go as far as to say it does have its benefits. With the Iron Sights parts of the screen is blocked off and sometimes the sights can be off. meaning even with  guns skill you may miss due to thinking you are on target when you arent.Without the Iron Sights you have your aiming reticle on the screen at all timesunless using a scoped weapon. What happens in F is the screen just zooms in a little with your reticle still there. which depending on gun skill and gun spread may actually be easier.for example i mainly use Ol Painless. which has  spread. meaning at  small guns skill the shots go exactly where the reticule is aimed.Whereas with New Vegas a gun skill of  you are still left with the accuracy of the Iron Sights. which can be off or misleading at times.I will say ive had better accuracy in F without Iron Sights than i have with Iron Sights in NV.Taking into account  in gun skills. using a Hunting Rifle or its unique variants.But as always your miles may vary.Just my two cents.,fnv,cucnmos,2,t5_2rzr5

5674402,0,t1_cx0ghmm,I seemed to have missed the first playthrough bit PIn that regard I would go for a balanced point distribution in S.P.E.C.I.A.L or traits that you prefer over others such as perception if you want to be able to detect more enemies at a distance and strength if you wish to carry more and deal more melee damage.  Make sure to put points into speech while playing.  It can get you out of sticky situations where you can potentially avoid combat with higher adversaries.  Other than that place points into any places that you want to follow Like your lockpicking and science skills.  These skills will work really well with all of the terminals and safes that you will come across. As its your first playthrough avoid putting points into survival.  I would pick three or four perks to focus on and build the other ones from there.  For example you like science and lockpicking so add sneak and guns onto there and you have a decent stealth character where you can sneak around disable turrets from terminals open locked doors to sneak around enemies etc.  ,fnv,cx0grwe,1,t5_2rzr5

As noted pasta is doable. Mac and Cheese and Cram  is a mod and it with spam is a real dish. Its well an acquired taste and way high in carbs and salt not that a radioactive courier would care. If you have Brahimin you probably have some lard so and with potatoes french  fries I dont know if you plan to add any of the food items from Boom to the Moon which I just finished for the second time  great mod BtW but many of those prepared would fit nicely Also I dont know what kind of resources you might have but anything that can grow in the region NCR to Utah roughly  might fit. Here is an egg  one I use two food mods these days My First Cookbook  and SW Recipes . Either of these might inspire you andor  maybe the authors would be kind enough to let you use their work.

Its just a side effect of these being independent usermade freeware type things  which its always flagging.  I once had a lot of trouble getting it to let me install a preview of a game my friend had been designing and emailed to me.  Whenever Id try to unpack it Id get told it was suspicious and that the files were being quarantined for my safety no matter how many different ways I tried to exempt them.  Was really frustrating actually not least cus I eventually went to their help forums and the most theyd offer to do was let me send them individual files to whitelist... instead of yknow telling me how to bypass the programs restrictions on the off chance I actually knew the origin of the file and wanted to make the decision to trust it all by myself... still not sure how I did get it working some amount of deleting and directoryshuffling but I think I had to destroy Frontier Secure in the process or maybe I didnt have to but I did.Anyway I really doubt your NVAC file is somehow dangerous especially if it came from a reputable source.  You could always run it thru another program if you wanted to be sure but if it were me I wouldnt even sweat it just knowing how often that stuff is wrong from being oversensitive.Obviously from where I sit I cant say for absolute sure but I just know that I get the same false positives pretty routinely and NVAC is a prime example of the type of file that sets it off.  Sometimes it flags custom installers debugging programs .bat files for renaming mps en masse stuff I absolutely know the origins of have used on this computer before maybe even for awhile now and which Im just plain certain isnt harmful.I dont wanna tell you its nothing and have it be something but put it this way...

Before that your best options are ratslayer and modded sniper rifles. MeleeUnarmed sneak attacks are also silent and do triple damage compared to ranged weapons double. I think the ballistic fist is the most damaging option herePerks  fast shot trait is ironically great for snipers. A  spread increase is nothing when your base spread is tiny so its basically free attack speed. Built to destroy is nice for gunfights small frame and skilled are generally good. Youll want better criticals for sneak attacks and its worth getting chance boosts finesse luck equipment as well for direct fights. Ninja if you want to try melee sneak attacks.

7128414,0,t1_d1odreb,Fair warning there are some odd random respawning containers out there personally I perceive no rhyme or reason to their wheres or whys but like you say if you are coming back to a container weeks later and its still how you left it chances are its safe.I actually like to leave something distinctive but worthless in a container I want to potentially use cus I pass by it often.  Like I have a morechems mod on that among other things adds different brands of cigarettes with varying effects so Ill leave like three camels and three lucky strikes something that wouldnt appear in a random loot drop and two brands that both served as my brand over the course of the time I smoked cigarettes in real life not my fuckin fallout character.  So even if I forget I did that Ill notice later and remember when I eventually refind and open that container again.Cus its not often that you put your trust in what turns out to be a respawn in container but its a total bitch when you do.Heres something Ive wondered before tho can NPCs loot containers when youre not around?  Cus I mean youll see em take a better weapon off a fallen comrade in battle sometimes you see em rifle thru a footlocker in the same manner or just randomly walk over to something and pick it up as part of an idle but is it possible to have that happen while youre in another cell?  How does time progress while youre not around?,fnv,d1of4s2,2,t5_2rzr5

7794108,0,t1_d3rqrn3,Well while its true that Fiends and the like are hostile from the get go I find it somewhat excusable in the base game. The base game already has nuanced and morally grey stuff going on with all the main factions. However when it comes to DLC I think theres a standard that it should really jam in quality content for it to really shine. Like imagine if DogGod was written in a way that always hostile to you in Dead Money. Hes the most unstable companion but he still had depth and the more you progressed got to learn his duality so that you could eventually resolve it or end him. The White Legs are a major player in HH and for a DLC to not let me explore these tribes or at least be given the opportunity to make resolution without running away or exterminating the main antagonistic tribe its a little disappointing. Yes I realize thats how White Legs are written and I understand theyre not willing to negotiate but Im just pointing out why it seems like lazy writing. ,fnv,d3s46sx,2,t5_2rzr5

You help them here and there and decide their leadership by either admin or action realising you could do it just by playing the virus purge minigame was interesting if ridiculous McNamara has done well by them but because of bureaucracy he gets deappointed? Nobody stuck up for him against hardin? The point Im getting at is choosing the brotherhoods path should have been a difficult affair  its unlikely theyd suddenly just change their minds about their only driving tenet because theyd have to face that Elijah got most of the chapter killed for a falsehood. If they went through such a terrible war and still believe strongly nothing will change their minds. Id have liked Hardin to have a little dissenter faction and a long quest line involving convincing them outsiders can be useful to their goal  saving them in the long run then deciding who to appoint. Who you appointed would change how the BoS operated you could leave them as traditionalist and then theyd be linked into the main story you could convince your chosen faction to fight with them and thus have them as back up in line with how you set them to advance ie more numbers is good theyll send a bunch of recruits as well who will distract fire and so on.

Go here killfind this return for like  of them.  The main quest is a one way railroad with like two total endings. Bad dialogue.  Vague interaction options though the voice acting is okay. Virtually no RPG elements.  No skills is a very large flaw imo.  I was hoping for a Skyrimesque leveling system where you increase skills by practicing them.  Instead they removed them entirely in favor of SPECIAL stats and perks. Very few base weapons.  As a gun nut I miss having a pumpaction shotgun a real LMG and assault rifle a grenade launcher and C explosives the most.  The leveraction rifle added with the DLC has a broken reload animation and has yet to be fixed as far as I know. Too many essential NPCs.  Literally everyone is killable in NV.

11163772,0,t3_5zdng6,My last playthrough was the most RP heavy. My character was called Apollo and was the first character I completed both the storyline and all of the DLC with so this was my highest level character yet in the end. He joined the NCR was pretty ruthless when it came to Legionaries Raiders and Powder Gangers. He was also an opportunist always trying to find the way that most benefitted his finances and ideology. He was more of an antihero than a straight hero and it was pretty fun while playing. There were moments when I told a friend of mine through Steam chat what I was doing with my character and he was just extremely disapproving. However he could also be extremely kind and generous to innocent souls if they really needed it. He wasnt  an asshole. Just .After playing so many straight hero characters this was a fun character to play.,fnv,dexeh27,10,t5_2rzr5

11467116,0,t1_dfvpvvb,I like using multiple weapons cause its fun and interesting I tend to carry at least  or  with me at all times its ridiculous.Ive never been able to kill many of anything with the riot shotgun in my experience it absolutely sucks.How does the multiplay have a crit rate of only ? I swear Im constantly getting messages telling me I crit with it does the crit rate apply to each shot? How does criticals with shotguns work? Is it applied to every pellet or collectively?DPS isnt all that important if you can kill them in one hit and dont have to reload after each shot the multiplas seems to work almost the best of any weapon on cazadores in my experience Ive only seen the chainsaw Sprtlewood and cleansing flame out match it and theyre god teir weapons in closeand even medium range for The Sprtlewood combat. Granted Ive never actually used a plasma caster so that might do better as wellnote Im not bringing up the FatmanEsther because those are fucking nuke launchers and are in an entirely different class.Christines COS silencer rifle is the best gun screw the AMR screw the YCS screw the hunting rifle the Silencer Rifle.Now I have an urge to make a character that only uses automatic weapons because Ive rarely actually touched them.,fnv,dfvshq9,0,t5_2rzr5
