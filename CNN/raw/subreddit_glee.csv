1209267,0,t3_27wtz4,The Peter Pan episode was written by KurtChris Colfer so thats part of why it was so cheesy. Hey we know you wrote a childrens book and youre on the show go ahead and write a tv episode. It was commended slightly for recognizing continuity. For example Sam mentioned his poor starving family which was nice because it was some of his only character development ever until they gave his dyslexia and poorness away to the new characters. seriously I get that dyslexia is an important issue but why not focus on the character who already has it instead of identically repeating the same plotline and hoping viewers dont notice But his episode had no good jokes and felt more like cheesy fanfiction than an episode of Glee.As for the season finale theres some crazy theories that they were going to write Darren Criss off the show and then decided that he was too popular hence the anticlimactic ending. Naya Rivera was going to be on it and then there was real life drama and so that had to be altered. And I think Ryan Murphy is setting up his crazy totally meta ending for Glee which is going to be insane. I rewatchedfinished up NipTuck last season on netflix which was another Ryan Murphy show where I liked the first few seasons but stopped watching for some reason or other. Thats another show where he goes completely insane towards the end and kind of gets too meta towards the end. Im guessing next season is going to be his crazy trainwreck season where he stops trying to fix it and just rolls with it. Will he send Kurt to Russia like he said he would in one interview? Who knows. But as long as theres some songs and jokes Im going to see it through to the end.,glee,ci5nsr5,3,t5_2royn
