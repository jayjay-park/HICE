5907808,0,t1_cxtxnle,I kinda hope she cuts it early next season though. She is starting show a bit of growth and maturity. Hopefully this reminds her of why she knocked him back initially she was unhappy with him. ,YouretheworstFX,cxu1ony,16,t5_32hlu
5912154,0,t1_cxu7dtj,I actually understand completely where youre coming from. I mean I think Arrested Development is possibly the smartest and most interesting comedy ever but it definitely doesnt have enough heart. The seasons of Community I saw had the same problem for me.Thats why I wasnt sure if Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia might be up your alley. The humor is very dark and theyve kept the quality quite steady for the  or so years its been on the air which is amazing. But theres no character growth or arcs and at the end of the day they dont feel like realistic people to me.So.... I dont think Ive seen anything quite like Youre the Worst but as someone who always complains about shows not having a lot of heart I feel that theres a few worth checking out that havent been mentioned in this thread yetDead Like Me Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls All by Bryan Fuller. To me hes a master of dialogue dark comedy inventive premises and creating likeable characters.The Office UK US Lifes Too Short and Extras. Out of those the one with the most likeable characters for me is the US version of The Office but theres still some dark and cringey humor.Raising Hope. Theres some dark humour especially in the pilot but at its core its a great crazy show about a family. I fell in love with every single character.Also worth checking out the early seasons of Weeds. The creator of Youre the Worst worked on that show.And well not sure if there are many similarities but I should recommend my favorite comedy of all time Parks and Recreation.These are the ones I can think of now that havent been mentioned before but Im sure theres a lot Im missing.,YouretheworstFX,cxum6n3,1,t5_32hlu
5967775,0,t1_cy0ssz1,I would love it if the show somehow got rid of her. Shes just one of those terrible people that just doesnt deserve to be happy. I do agree that Verne could not raise a child on his own because it in a way hes still kind of a child himself. But I would much rather see that child be raised by someone else other than that horrible bitch and that absolute moron. I would love it if the writers somehow I know this is farfetched but if they somehow made it so that Jimmy and Gretchen will raising that child instead of those two people. I just think that would be better. Here I am acting like its real life situation but As for my personal preference I would much rather see that youre no longer in the show. But if she is there should be a running gag of her being constantly unhappy and things going wrong. Because thats what a person like that deserves. Im not saying I dont like Lindsay I just think shes the worst of the four main characters. especially with the way she actsreacts to everything that is Paul. And Im not sure if youre agreeing with me or if you misunderstood what I said about Paul but I like Paul. Yes hes weird but theres nothing wrong with Paul. And Lindsey acts like HES the worst. I just feel like Lindsay needs to I guess stop being a moron. She has this person in her life who will and has done anything to make her happy. And shes just not for it at all. thats just my opinion about Lindsey I like her but I think shes just the worst of the four main characters because of how she treats her relationship with Paul. I do admit wishing death upon one of the characters may have been a reach. But thats just how much I hate Becca. She at the least deserves no happiness.I think that may have been what got The show a third season. The raw emotion and tear jerking moments of the last two episodes. I really cant wait to see when season  is coming out and what theyre going to do with these characters.,YouretheworstFX,cy1wnbu,1,t5_32hlu

9416427,0,t1_d99h708,I mean the show is about shitty people finding solace in each other but the show also highlights Good people at risk of becoming bad people. Lindsey is far in a way the worst person on the show by miles. Shes unaware selfish abusive manipulative and cold. Lindsey is damn near Psychopathic to anyone who is not Gretchen.  Paul while being good if not a little dry can not escape her and is doomed to turning into Jimmy. Where as Paul is about people turning other people shitty Edgar is about someone making himself shitty.  ,YouretheworstFX,d99liw8,19,t5_32hlu
