5404879,0,t1_cw2i98e,The problem is that a lot of people dont even realize the game has VoIP because the game defaults hearing VoIP broadcasts off which is a bit unusual. Push to talk is enabled by default once youve turned VoIP on meaning unless you hit the default key for it G you wont be broadcasting anything.So you run in to the situation of people trying to communicate through VoIP and the rest of the team not responding because they cant even hear them. By default. Its just a little odd and can be a bit frustrating since theres often not a lot of time to stand around and type.,Vermintide,cw2j7w3,6,t5_36d6l

5423885,0,t3_3pb3v7,Two Handed Hammer and Handgun. Basically find this the best way to take out armored and specials effectively from most ranges. Handgun allows me to one shot head shot anything generally except an ogre at range. Zoom also allows me to spot potential targets for team that could cause problems. Two handed hammer kills most clan rats in one strike and I believe stormvermin in two hits on the head. The charged swing can be done at varying charges to push enemies back to give you some breathing room to maneuver for some single crushing blows.Im just waiting for upgraded versions of these I seem to be getting single axes and hammers instead DPlaying on Normal atm.,Vermintide,cw4yhhf,1,t5_36d6l

5443156,0,t1_cw7ewfy,The problem is however I cant target farm blue beamstaffs if I want an orange one for example if I could target farm white items Id already be happy with that system because eventually Id get the right item through forging.Maybe just maybe when you reach max lvl set a bonus exp cap every k exp or something like that and award us with a white item of our choice. Problem solved for ME at least.Btw you can even target the specific item you want by melting  of those  chance for each item. And you are right people seem to not know about it But the game does a bad job at expressing that other than with the symbol when you are fusing.Would people that say my changes would make the game too fast and easy be happy with this max lvl white item solution?,Vermintide,cw7ez0e,1,t5_36d6l

5463901,0,t1_cwa1ndr,See it is elitism though  just because someone has a lower level doesnt mean theyre incompetent.  I am level ? havent looked recently.  I know. where all the loot in each level is tomes and grims included.. to check whose hp is lowest before taking medical supplies. to hide from stormvermin patrols rather than fight they will pass you and are not worth the trouble.. to use the block button if isolated till an opening pops up. you can block and dodge simultaneously allowing for quick escapes running is slower than dodging you can dodge backwards faster than you can run backwards. to block ogre hits at the cost of the whole stamina bar.. how to aim and avoid shooting friendlies unless they run right past me as I fire cant help that.. To always choose speed pots because every level has a point where they help you can carry explosive barrels and sacks of grain faster you can also run to the last carriage faster on smugglers run and they help go between markers in mages final room. to stay with the group or at very least paired If I see someone run off on their own I try to have their backGenerally I know how to play the game I know how to plan for success but because my level isnt  Im assumed to be a bumbling idiot wholl run around and get my head cut off.  When I die its usually unfortunate corner turning trying to protect someone else getting ambushed from behind or getting a tome not a grim which I refuse to pick up without consulting the group first that the group hasnt headed for yet.Am I missing any important points?I can do hard easily but I cannot get any nightmare matches because I get kicked  of the time due to my level and the only good way to prepare for those is to practice in them.

So dodging back gives me another second to finish.You can dodge gutter runners too but its pretty situational and easier when they are far away.Ogre punches you can dodge back to avoid some times. Allowing you to distract him for  full hits before taking damage.  Dodge the first one and then block the nd one and hopefully get knocked away by it.Stormvermin over head swing is easy to dodge too. But sometimes they swing from side to side and idk how to dodge that one and it is hard to tell which they will do. Best bet with them is to just kill them as soon as possible.

Hell I have about half the game done on cataclysm and I do not think I used a BW once in any of them. She just consistently underpreformed because simply put in cataclysm she cannot put out enough damage without constantly being overheated and having a CC bot that literally does nothing but CC and very occasionally kill something is worthless. Far better to bring a brace of pistols which can clear a rat ogre in about  seconds and a Zweirapier. When you have a dwarf with a grudge raker and two handed hammer groups are not a problem. I have a rupturereload speed grudge raker and the CC is not really required since if they group up enough for a comflag bright wizard to be good they are all dead from the raker anyway since it cuts through large groups with hilarious ease even on cataclysm.

5548281,0,t3_3r4ejl,Mmm well it varies a bit. Ill be doing some comparisons to the tabletop rules in addition to the fluff since theyre a fairly concrete place for analysis and for the most part reflect power levels alright. First its worth noting that  characters we play as are hero level units which means they outclass everything but Rat Ogres rather easily. We dont know the exact power levels of the folks in the game so I wont be comparing them to named characters since that would be rather impossible. Its hard to measure the skaven since pound for pound everyone we play as would measure favorably in a oneonone melee against any nonrat ogre in melee. Most of the Skaven specials are ranged or onehit wonders assassins. Witch Hunter Fluff wise their power level varies since theyre all individuals. In terms of the tabletop they make for powerful assassins as theyre good in oneonone challenges. Generally spend their days rooting out various infestations of monsters and heretics within the empire as you might have gathered. Fluff wise theyre usually around the level of an elite soldier.Bright Wizard While technically the magical equivalent of a line soldier bright wizards are still powerful. Specializing in all things fire one or a few bright wizards are often found supporting the armies of the empire when they go to war. Another hero level unit shes as powerful as most other common mages. The higher tabletop version of a mage is a Wizard Lord a position I suspect the grey wizard encountered in the wizards tower holds.Waywatcher These are effectively the Delta Force of the woodelves. While not herolevel theyre still extremely powerful. They protect and patrol the entrances and exits of Athel Loren and are one of the first lines of defense against intruders. Unmatched archers each one can fire a hail of arrows or shoot so accurately as to ignore armor. Also extremely sneaky and as you might expect theyre the woodland experts par excellence in warhammer. Its rumored that theyre also in charge of dealing with making sure nothing gets out of the dark heart of the forest.Dwarven Ranger In tabletop terms were leaving the super elite pools now. Dwarven rangers are still elite but theyre not quite the creme de la creme for Dwarves that would be Hammerers. Rangers are dwarves who for one reason or another live a lot of their lives above ground and become quite good at scouting and skirmishing. Skilled for dwarves but they occupy a niche role on the tabletop.Empire Soldier I havent played the soldier much so I dont know quite what unit he is from the tabletop. However it seems likely he was a Reiksguard knight or something similar putting him at a very elite level for humans. Less powerful than the first three fluff and crunchwise but still a skilled and dangerous opponent. Hopefully that helped  Let me know if you have more questions I love talking about the lore. The tldr is that all five are elite units with the most elite being the WH BW and WW in terms of fluff. All of them are deadly opponents who in fluff or tabletop could tackle any nonrat ogre opponent with a good chance of success special bits like an assassin surprise attack aside.,Vermintide,cwktd9b,32,t5_36d6l

Sure it happens in other industries but its just become accepted that currentgen games will suffer from a bug and performance standpoint but might be fixed eventually.  They should have had a more uninterrupted beta period. No question about it.  Its a fun game and Ill continue to play it but people saying that well Skyrims launch was worse is a horrible excuse.  These people didnt make a game that even scratches the surface of complexity that Bethesda did with Skyrim and I believe that Bethesda did an outstanding job supporting the game directly and allowing the modding community to jump in and patch the game as they see fit.

5593215,0,t3_3rq9fq,I spend a lot of time playing Dwarf with AxeShield and either Handgun or Crossbow. This is an absolutely devastating combo but the trick to it is you must use the charged attacks the shield attacks against groups. If you learn the timing on them youre good to go. HandgunCrossbow can one shot specials on headshots on all but the highest difficulties NM and Cata but it depends on what youre shooting at. This means you will almost never have to melee a Stormvermin but if you do just play it safe with the shield and get some good axe strikes in axe is armor piercing.I have also spent some time playing Bright Wizard and while the Flaming Sword seems like the solid melee choice I find myself switching between Conflagration and Beam staves constantly.

5661290,0,t3_3sn1re,I can only speak from someone that purely plays it casually with friends. I tried playing it on my own but it seems everyone is just farming HOM or whatever for items. The real fun I had with the game came from trying to get through the levels with mates and getting better at them and trying them at harder difficulties.I saw something similar with Evolve which I loved as well. In that the game requires an insane amount of teamwork especially at higher difficulties. Similar in Evolve people just got tired of playing with new players that would ruin the game. The community itself was great but due to the game having to rely on every single player to be a competent team there was no margin for error. So in Vermintide players who play alone eventually would just get frustrated.The loot system is frustrating and basically most of the time you are rewarded with nothing. I wish the game would provide you  a currency or like coin drops instead of extra dice. Then you could approach the inn keeper and buy items or buffs for the next map. Have a blacksmith sell you weapons even.Also the game kinda runs like poo for me will constant frame drops and there are still bugs.Well thats my take on things its still fun for me though because of how little I play it ironically.,Vermintide,cwyu5ul,1,t5_36d6l

Any reason for such low levels?  I feel like attack speed would help kill but also mitigate hits really well.  It would only be bad in my eyes if it just rarely ever procs which could be the case.Maybe I have higher ratings for everything simply because I think youd want to upgrade your favorite orange fully no matter what.  Thus most of the D ratings I would consider in BC range personally unless its truly an abysmal D affix like Hawk Eye.  Perhaps youre thinking youll just get a better orange so unlocking it would be a waste.. but my RNG gods say Ill probably get enough blues to unlock all my affixes before I get another more perfect orange of my weapon type.

5906595,0,t3_3vzeww,I play Kruber primarily.  I started out with swordshield got an exotic hammer as my first exotic but didnt play with it much  but once I figured out HOW to play with it I use it  of the time.  With a rifle to snipe specials.Heres what Ive found to be key for using the hammer effectively on NMCata. Always use charge attack unless you are certain there is only  rat. Step back when you start to charge up step forward when swinging. When swinging rotate your view slightly to gain an extra  degrees on your arc. Dodge is your BFF.  Use it when you miss use it when you need to reposition in the middle of a fight use it as needed for each special. Be aware of your environment.  Because of how you need to move when using the hammer if youre backed flat against a wall or in a thin hallwaydoor frame youre gonna have a bad time. Always have your head on a swivel.  If you have an extra split second at ANY time check your surroundings for rats you didnt see before teammate activity etc.. Know your vulnerability. When youre on your routine charged attack you are a massive powerhouse.  If you get interrupted youre boned.  Engage on your terms and you wont get interrupted.Having the immense power to killknock away everyone in a wide arc in front of you and position yourself to hit them again by the time they recover is awesome.,Vermintide,cxtvyy2,1,t5_36d6l

It is as hard the game is ever going to be. If you master it there are no more progression. For a a more casual experience play more casual difficulties. Whether it is because you cant devote as much time to the game to truly master it or if you just dont want to deal with the stress  that is okay. And the game truly do cater to those people as well. There are nothing inherently gained by more powerful loot if the enemies are not more powerful either. It might only hurt your ego to not be able to be among the top . players.

Pretty anecdotal to say the repeater is capable of landing all its shots especially while you and the ogre are moving Lol.. Are you sure I have bad aim or are you lying?

Did you know that other people play Cata too? Lol at assuming only Shadowthief is good enough to play Cata. Let me substantiate my claim since you are not smart enough to read my post for a second time so I will make it clear for you a third. You are lying if you say you land  of your shots clicking as fast as you can while moving with the repeater. I mean honestly its like youve never even played the game before.

Perhaps latency is indeed related to the issue which would explain why internal testing is failing to reproduce it.  Could a health check process be run that reports some game data including regional information? Then if a game concludes successfully the data is disregarded or moved to a normal functionality bucket but if the game is launched anew without a successful resolve then its flagged as questionable?Im happy to optin to data collection if theres privacy concerns or run in debug to help resolve the problem.  Ill even informally poll for geo location to pass along anecdotal issues.On a side note the game also periodically locks up when someone joins your game during map load. Perhaps theres a CPU load issue somewhere and these are similar aspects?In parting perhaps if internal testing isnt showcasing the issue try having your testers play in the open lobby? Join games in different geo locations and with random teammates so you have the same conditions live players have?

8815238,0,t3_50tur9,Eh... um.. er.Hi?That title was sucessful in making me do a doubletake if anything.Anyway while I do find the idea amusing I dont think Fatshark needs to hire me to see and consider whatever ideas I may have for the game. Im sure most devs browse the sub often enough that they see all of it.One thing I do want to say is that while game balance in fact shouldnt be done in accordance to your average complaining individual or even with only the top  in consideration there is value in considering the opinion of those who have extensively played the game.As said though an experienced player alone isnt enough to make a good voice for game balancing since many may indeed feel inclined to simply bend the balance so that it hovers around their particular playstyle we dont want that.I am way past the point of only playing bolt BW or trueflight elf even if Sienna is still my favorite hero. And yes if I were to actually have a voice in rebalancing weapons the bolt and trueflight would both get a sizable reality check even though the power hungry player in me would be sad for doing it.But make of that what you will really. Ill let the folks at Fatshark decide themselves on if and how the weapons need to be rebalanced and Ill just hope theyll be smart enough to not simply throw all the autoaim into oblivion with a nerf so massive that they basically become trash tier weaponry.,Vermintide,d77gzqk,6,t5_36d6l

9786178,0,t1_daionr0,gt The problem with the handgun isnt simply that active reload doesnt work it is also the mastercrafted nerf and the fact it still works on the blunderbuss. Without mastercrafed or active reload the rifle becomes one of the less viable weapons for cataclysm. Being only able to have a single usable shot during a horde without becoming a noncontributing burden whilst reloading. There is no real reason to take any other trait over mastercrafed even at .gt Ideally  get rid of the recoil animation altogether. With the nerfed mastercrafted this will likely balance it out to be the same weapon only making mastercrafed itself less mandatory still mandatory.gt Blundergrudge and drakes were also quite viable in cataclysm.All handguns got a reload buff on top of the tweaks to Mastercrafted and the removal of active reload. While I agree I think it needs some more tuning I think right now Handgun is extremely strong and probably the best option for both the Dwarf and Soldier both at lower difficulties and on Cata. The removal of active reload doesnt make it completely worthless by a long shot but it gives the other weapons some breathing room even if you need to stop and reload for a few seconds after. With a good group this wont be much of an issue if youre oneshotting a Stormvermin.While the Gruderaker Blunderbus and Drakefire might be viable on Cata for a chance of pace they were nowhere near as good or useful as the Handgun.gt Im not sure you understood the point OP was trying to make about the h sword nerf. The weapon is supposed to favor charged attacks the new balance makes its secondary attack worse for crowd control and the primary attack more viable. Adding more targets with the faster speed of the primary attack will make the sword better at crowd control that the secondary attack.Theres nothing written anywhere that says the h Sword has to favor charge attacks. The weapon did previously but that doesnt mean it needs to going forwards. At the end of the day the devs are the ones who decide how the weapons should be balanced.gt This seems backward to me if you are doing faster attacks then you leave yourself open to enemy attacks far less often and for much shorter durations.This only holds or works against small numbers of rats which are fairly easy to deal with anyway. While its certainly possible to use primarily lighter attacks with some weapons the heavy attacks generally push and stagger more targets making them better for handling rushes in general. If you want to use primarily light attacks on a rush then you need to be more careful with your blocks pushes and dodges because its more likely that your light attack will hit a few rats and then any it didnt hit will stab you in the face.As someone who plays with newbies a lot one of the biggest mistakes you see them make is trying to play like this is LD and just melee spamming their way to victory as they get wrecked due to not blocking pushing or dodging.gt Oh dear This has not been my experience. Whilst I normally use a combination of charged and normal attacks on lone or small clusters of rats lmb spam is a easy way to keep a few rats staggered without the need for pushing.A few rats arent the issue ever unless youve barely played the game. The real danger is specials and rushes any weapon can deal with a few rats quite easily in the current meta except maybe the Bright Wizards mace and even that can with correctly timed shoves to skip bad attacks in the chain.,Vermintide,dajcyc2,1,t5_36d6l

But in cata it falls off since you have to commit  shots for clan rats.Dual Dagger though not as versatile as the SampD still has a its uses but it relies heavily on your team you have to adapt a whole different playstyle where you wait to go into melee so your shieldhanded user has time to get some control and aggro on the horde thats when you strike with backstabbery and melt the rat bastards it does insane damage to the rat ogre and because of its quick charge attack you become a good anti storm vermin slayer. ,Vermintide,dc2oiby,1,t5_36d6l

10790463,0,t3_5ubs2b,Soldier h has pretty good crowd control but the h hammer does that pretty well as well.h hammer for bardin can potentially be one of his best weapons with KB as it hits infinite targets. It also has better dodge than his other weapons which are all low dodge and very slow block walk speeds so this is a good option if you like to joust more than hold the line. It also OHKOs clanrats on cata with its charge attack which also staggers and hurts SV. So its a great all in one KB monster that allows bardin to also move freely.

They dont need more. P.S. There was a translation well that was mental effort gone to waste.

11087803,0,t1_deos5t3,For beginner great axers in NM pair with drakefires. One charged blast from the drakefires will make your charge attack straight up kill all four targets maybe with the last one getting killed a second or two later via DoT. Slowly you will accustom to great axing by itself and then will be able to pair it with the other choices of Bardin like the grudge raker or crossbow. If you are really good with the grudge raker you can try using it as your protection from running rats and such and your wave holder switching back and forth as you shotgun push and then charged swing repeat. ,Vermintide,deosjrp,2,t5_36d6l
11092326,0,t3_5y88pq,Bayonet became a thing by the end of th century in our world yeah but Ive not seen any mention of bayonets in warhammer and even then it were plug type bayonets  you inserted them into the barrel which prevents firing. The typical ring bayonet you were probably describing was used from the beginning of th century.I like the idea of wizard buffing melee weapons while increasing heat could work for swords as well as mace and provide interesting way of dealing with stormvermin or ogre by melee.Throwing daggers sounds cool though Im not sure if you want to throw a rare mastercrafted elven dagger thats not made for throwing. Im not sold on the boomerang thing either. What could work however is a new trinket that would give any character throwing weapons knives axes darts etc. based on character that would recharge at ammo drops rapier would get increased offhand ammo instead.If I understand it correctly you want to place shield slam current charged attack with shields on special attack and have the charged attack of the h variant of the weapon available for the shield variant as well. One thing is that h charged attacks use two hands for the animation another is that they would become obsolete if shield variants had their full moveset plus more stamina and shield slam. The special attack does feel unused however so Id suggest an offhand weapon one drakefire or pistol for kruber same as rapier that could be fired while blocking. If saltzpyre can carry rapier a dozen pistols and volley crossbow with  full quivers of blots bardin can sling one more drakefire pistol on the side.The alternative fire modes for pistols and handgun  not sure how that would work. You can be pretty accurate with pistols if you wait a bit after each shot take targeteer if you feel like its still crap. Were talking about pistols its a miracle they are as precise as they are right now. Not sure how volley fire or quick fire would work on the musket technically. You could switch to alternative ammunition maybe some high quality gunpowder or add zoom like with longbows reduce normal zoom and add more zoom on special attack.,Vermintide,depazx1,1,t5_36d6l

This is ideal for farming  grim  tome  cursed dice on nightmare maps to get as many red items as fast as possible. This is what most people do this is what i do and in this scenario it is optimal to run stability as top tier trait.For somebody who runs cata or deathwish they probably do not care about time lost while venting a bit more and care alot about stunning storm vermin. But this is minority of people. I supose you guys and your pro friends are part of that minority group. I think disclaimer is in order. Something like for cata and deathwish stability is useles.

Take in note than when you have to revive a mate blocking is good pushing before more without db you will not take the aggro of the rats because the AI use a perception and not a real aggro system the behaviour is nicely done for this. Also the angle of h hammers is less wild than a h hammer or hammer and shield. I understand the thing im used to also do it.

Many of the new objectives seem... like how youd be playing anyways. I dont know many teams even pubs that wont hurry to rescue someone getting wreckt by a special for instance. Id be more excited for challenges such as speedrun or complete mission with only two players that would actually mix the gameplay up a bit.Speedrun would encourage newer players to pick up some basic runandpush and kiting skills and duo brings depending on your teammates to a whole notha level.

11499701,0,t1_dfxeq8l,I can see it as a final boss for the DLC like a better version of the White Rat.But honestly if anything I think wed get the Grey Seer as an enemy simply because in patch . theres a new version hiding in the game files. Unlike the smoke and mirrors version in White Rat its got  health and a shield that reduces all damage to . I could see it teleporting around sometimes activating the shield and forcing players to seek coveravoid it till the shield goes down.They could even make it like Killing Floor  and have a  chance of a random Ogre spawn being either an Ogre or or a Grey Seer.,Vermintide,dfzhomq,2,t5_36d6l

11544915,0,t3_64sb2s,If memory serves and I dont remember where I initially read this so take it all with a grain of salt the White SV are higher ranking SV.  Essentially the highest ranking ground forces.  As far as game functions go theyre just cosmetic.  Unfortunately as far as I am aware whether a SV is red or white is client side so while you may see a white SV others may see a red one.,Vermintide,dg4m9e9,5,t5_36d6l

11554379,0,t1_dg5nnil,Hi Because the framerate was also involved. Just not a matter of decrease buff movement. Lot of mechanics are linked to the framerate in this game. ,Vermintide,dg5oy1c,2,t5_36d6l

11635784,0,t1_dgerfwm,All staffs viable? Youre kidding right?Fireball is simply a joke now that only pushes rats around. Bolt generates way too much heat and takes ages to mark a target red  which makes it s impossible to aim for a headshot and only shoot a st charge bolt.,Vermintide,dgexgao,1,t5_36d6l
11654010,0,t1_dggzkoy,It depends on what you mean by density.  If you go in a small room like the ammo room at the end the density will go up to much much higher that  rats per beam radius.  Try and put yourself in a corner vs dense horde and you will see what I mean.  Also you cant control sv so you need room to move.,Vermintide,dggzvwq,2,t5_36d6l

11698152,0,t1_dglw5ts,I usually grab a grimoire so I dont use potion share and therefore I dont use the dupe on consumption trinket. But yeah the  is better for not consuming than duping so that would give you more mileage. But the dupe is also for heals and bombs so thats why I run dupe myself.I just dupe stuff for others,Vermintide,dgm05ms,1,t5_36d6l

11733818,0,t1_dgq12ta,I fully agree with you. This DLC looks pretty dull. They dont even bother to make a good trailer... I was really hyped about previous dlcs but this one just looks dissapointing...,Vermintide,dgq23pz,2,t5_36d6l
11747593,0,t1_dgrm3vg,Thats not a bad idea but its also not particularly exciting and most of the DLC weapons follow that pattern.  I honestly think both h sword and mace fit her kit well without being overpowering.  In some ways Id rather see them clean up weapons that dont currently work well or have an identity.  For example the flaming sword is just worse than the regular sword Id rather see that fixedreworked than a new weapon.,Vermintide,dgrmaqp,1,t5_36d6l

11766301,0,t1_dgtpmzk, hp slaves. And it matters noticeably for all those  damage weapons.KB definetly gains alot of value in DW over cata but at the same time isnt the endallbeall since stormvermins survive it.Falchion is noticeably still not going to run killing blow and becomes a skill show of being able to chain headshots to reliably dispatch things.A strength pot in deathwish effectively makes the clans and slaves die exactly as fast as they would in nightmare without strength. Most meta weapons are capable of  damage headshots which means they can oneshot clans under strength and not rely on killing blow to do it.,Vermintide,dgtqo3z,3,t5_36d6l
11778340,0,t1_dguybqj, of WHs suck anyway.  Theyre usually just playing him because elf was taken so they snarf every healthkit they can find and hope nobody notices.  But we notice.,Vermintide,dgv41w0,2,t5_36d6l
