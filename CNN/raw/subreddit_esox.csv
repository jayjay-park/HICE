2548265,0,t3_2b5z4x,Good to see a musky take off like that although you were holding it downstream rather than upstream. Fish collect oxygen in their gills by sitting still or moving forward through the water. Always face the fishs face upstream and hold it still dont pull it back and forth. It will correct its equilibrium breathe and then take off. If you hold its head facing downstream youre drowning the fish.,esox,cmr71gp,1,t5_2war2
