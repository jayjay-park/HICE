6454197,0,t1_czmuroo,Many people have died on waves smaller than this.  They get rolled around so much they dont know what way is up or down cant see anything and the weight of that water pushing down holds them under.  If that doesnt kill them many times they will be smashed into a reef or the seabed.  The big wave dudes usually have a dedicated jet ski guy to come in and save him if he surfaces before the next wave hits.,sfw_wtf,czmwmls,3,t5_2tipv
