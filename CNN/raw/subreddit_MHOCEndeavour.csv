This is an important factor in engineering.Maybe they prefer to employ young people because currently it is cheaper to employ them?,MHOCEndeavour,cy607ru,2,t5_3bb4z

8722429,0,t3_4zf0it,I find it odd that the Endeavour can only muster the drive to critique but a small section of a manifesto. Furthermore you have simply glossed over policies regarding immigration and international development which I believe are also integral to any foreign policy. These include policies such as accepting more migrants originally from Syria in order to help them escape Daesh a more open overall immigration policy and supporting the Scotland Malawi Partnership.Finally the notion that the SNP does not care for Scottish people is simply untrue. As it states in the section you reviewed the EU supports over  Scottish jobs and so staying in the EU will only help the people of Scotland. The result of our model referendum in my opinion became a meta issue of poor moderation and implementation of the mEU. Thus it is wrong to say that Scotland rejects the idea of a European union we only know that they reject the mEU.Id give this article a  for Tory spin however.,MHOCEndeavour,d6vy0fy,1,t5_3bb4z

9079052,0,t1_d835c7m,Nope Im not overlooking anything.The speech in question can be found here.gtThe rest of the United Kingdom can learn from this Assembly. The current political stalemate is an absolute disgrace and it is damaging the United Kingdom. We need to be able to provide progress for Northern Ireland and we cannot allow stalemate in Westminster affect us harshly here in the North of Ireland. I propose we call on the parliament of Westminster to allow us to have more power to govern ourselves away and be free of their own parliamentary deadlock and their negative effects on Northern Ireland. I also propose that this house affirms support in the implementation of a caretaking government by the incumbent coalition in order to keep the country stable whilst a majority coalition is created by the opposition in Westminster.This speech specifies the make up of the caretaker government being the incumbent government. Whilst yes they could support a more wider spread of the Commons being included in an incumbent government there is still widespread support for even the incumbent government forming a caretaker government.,MHOCEndeavour,d835kuh,2,t5_3bb4z

He backs research. These two things are very different. The fact is you have given the impression that he supports something that he doesnt support.
