Nothing more.Drag blues is a style of bluesdancing done in parts in close embrace.Joe and Nelle Demers have a video about drag blues on youtube and since they created it or at least codified it they should know.Blues can be really tricky to categorize at times but this question is also malformed. You dont use drag blues in ballroomin drag blues consists of elements from traditional juke joint blues and ballroomin but was created way later than ballroomin was.What they may be refering to could also be slow drag which is a vintage dance which can be observed as the dancers moving and letting one foot lag or drag behind slightly. But this is also NOT close embrace. It is however as far as I know always danced in close embrace something not true for drag blues.It may be that the instructors know the difference between the two but simply dont talk about the dance in a way that distinguishes the concepts but I digress. ,BluesDancing,cfkuwl1,7,t5_2uefw
1323487,0,t3_24e5xj,I think one of the biggest difficulties our community has in terms of accurately representing Blues is in making the distinction between what my scene does and what Blues is. A lot of what the people describe in the video has nothing to do with Blues dancing as such.All that said its a nice video that shows what people love about your scene.,BluesDancing,ciiicc1,1,t5_2uefw

7123078,0,t3_4d5214,So not sure if this is the best place to ask but it seemed closer to a blues crowd question than a lindy one. If theres a better subreddit for my question please let me know.     I took a class at our local swing dance place a while ago and they taught a dance that they called the Dallas Fort Worth Swingout which makes it sound like swing music but its actually danced to soul music. They have instructors choice lessons every once and a while where theyll teach something different like a line dance or a new style and this was one of those.     Its a bit confusing so this is a video of me trying to demonstrate what I learned in that hour just to make it clear. You have to turn the volume way up to hear the music.  The basic step rhythm starts with a stepstep pickup that then goes into a repeating triplestep triplehitandhitandstep  or kicks instead of hits.     Im looking for instructional youtube videos as it was fun but an hour wasnt really enough time to learn more than the basic and one turn. And all I get when I search Dallas Fort Worth Swing out is lindy hop from Dallas. Is there another name for this? Do you have any suggestions?,BluesDancing,d1nt6yt,1,t5_2uefw

I think understanding how it was felt and made at the time would and should greatly inform our understanding of the music and dance as it stands today. How would you rate this understanding in regards to its contribution to your enjoyment of the dance?,BluesDancing,d8jxkhl,1,t5_2uefw
