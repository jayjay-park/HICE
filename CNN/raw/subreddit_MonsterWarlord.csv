3511313,0,t1_cpscx79,You use a well known person for it usually otherwise you have a chance of being scammed. Well you always have a chance but a well known person will typically be less likely to scam you.You attack a person a set number of times for a boss. Like me I sell bosses for XP at a rate of  Attacks per boss or  Attacks for a set.,MonsterWarlord,cpsihwl,1,t5_2wk0f
