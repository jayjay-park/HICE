The way I order snus now is I make  purchases with  cans in each package at the same time. So if one gets taxed Im still good. But recently they have all been coming through so Ive been getting lucky. Even if one gets taxed occasionally youre still coming out ahead buying online rather than buying in store here you can find General at Macs but theyre like  a can. Also I started using my girlfriends name and address but I dont know if that has to do with anything. I used to order from buysnus and I got taxed a lot then I switched to northerner and barely get taxed. Might be the different package I dont know.
