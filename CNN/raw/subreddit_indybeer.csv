462046,0,t3_1zdcpa,The liquor store with the most diverse selection in terms of different beers has been Kahns for myself.  Wish they had a store on the westside or at least out near AvonPlainfield but the downtown store off Penn isnt too out of the way.  In terms of other places you have Big Red Liquors which has started popping up everywhere around Indy which doesnt seem to carry many craft selections other than some obvious ones and Payless Liquors which has a better beer slection than BigRed but not as immense as Kahns.  Granted these are just the places around Indy west side that I have access to so Im sure we have some other nuggets out there.  ,indybeer,cfssa5b,1,t5_2z0g9
713766,0,t1_cgk1o3w,There are at least  other farms in operation and possibly a half a dozen or so more.  Hammers and Hoosier Hops I know have been around for the past few years. Weve been telling people that early to mid summer will be a great time to come up and check us out as the chaos of trellis work stringing planting and training will have slowed down. I think theres a meeting in the works between Indiana hops growers the deparment of agriculture and brewers in the very near future so by that time a better list can be put together. There are also some people working on a local malt house as well as Indiana yeast programs so soon we can have a locally grown locally brewed locally drank beer. ,indybeer,cgleq2u,1,t5_2z0g9

2511537,0,t1_cmm9c1b,I suggested in the last few weeks in this sub when there was a question of what could be added to make the sub overall better but it didnt get asked since then. It really should be a weekly thing though. There is so much beer coming in its hard to keep track of it all. ,indybeer,cmme9zs,1,t5_2z0g9

4499204,0,t3_3bpidd,Thats not a bad place for a brewery. Its convenient to those going downtown. I dont make it downtown as much as Id like and when I do I dont have my growlers. ,indybeer,csxs2av,1,t5_2z0g9
5059161,0,t1_cuurmb3,Ive been going to beer festivals for over  years and had all but given up on the regular festivals. Im not a hip things were cooler back in the day type but theyre just too big way too crowded and with all the JohnnyComeLately types who are now all about beer the festivals havent been as fun and lowkey as they had been in the past. I kinda got over it when I saw three people puking into bushes in degree weather in Broad Ripple a couple of years ago.      The CANvitational however is the best festival Ive been to in years. Its not too crowded last year they spread it over the entire PanAm plaza so there was a lot of space you dont wait very long in line and its not just the same breweries I can visit around the state  its breweries who specialize in canning. I dig that because hey canned beer can be shipped and travels well so we can get stuff from outside the area.  Last years iteration was great. I got to try a lot of breweries Id never heard of it was very well organized and even the weather couldnt have been better looks like itll be the same this Saturday.    Even as cheap as I am its worth it for me.,indybeer,cuvtivw,4,t5_2z0g9
