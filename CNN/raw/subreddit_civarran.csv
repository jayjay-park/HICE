2024720,0,t3_2hst07,Alright then you all are probably going to be the closest Nether Factory to Xiphias.  So we would be will to help fund the endeavor.  My suggestion would be to put the factory in Arran and having a private rail between Arran and Fort Knox.  As far as cost I would recommend printing tickets that would be needed to access the Portal.  Each ticket would cost a certain amount say i.  The people who donate would have their donations tallied in d based on global average prices for an item.  Based on the total percentage they contributed as far as cost that would be their share of the ticket sales.  Yes they would have to purchase tickets as well with those involved in facility maintenance being exempt from paying with the caveat that they do not use travel for commercial purposes.  OnceIf we have an idea about what the factory looks like and exactly how it operates we should set up a cooperative to begin drafting designs on a creative server.  I can assist with security and redstone features.  I think its important to remember that this Nether Portal is not a community service at least at the beginning and travel through it is a luxury product. ,civarran,ckx6o1g,1,t5_2xjpe
