2726854,0,t3_2r5hrp,OK  my solution is a new sec field and that is only displayed in bright mode. An value for second only in bright mode would be the solution. So we could set only one code for time and the seconds will displayed in bright mode and no seconds in dimmed mode.,WatchMaker,cne15pq,1,t5_347l3

3280785,0,t3_2xpgi2,Ive got several faces on Facerepo. The way I see it Im not selling them so why would I care if someone wants to copy them? And if you dont have them copywrited you dont even have the right to tell them that they arent allowed to copy it. If you think you DO have the right to tell them they cant copy it just Google sriracha sauce and see who created it and who holds the patent for it. All it is is a case of rudeness on that guys part for copying it. ,WatchMaker,cp28ii4,10,t5_347l3

4156981,0,t3_38a9gw,the faces are in fact .zip files with xml markup inside you could edit those directly Ive seen some web apps that can read .face files an you can edit stuff but the apps are way at the beginning and dont work as they should. Starting from a .face file and editing will most likely be easier than building from ground up but I decided to wait for a better tool.,WatchMaker,cru3vvv,1,t5_347l3
4780526,0,t3_3gdjt1,Make a circle and use the segment shader option on it. For the degree setting on the shader use drs for seconds that tick or drss for a smoother movement. Then put another slightly smaller circle on top of it thats the same color as the background.,WatchMaker,ctx4jmr,1,t5_347l3

6553887,0,t3_458pvq,Question as someone who uses WatchMaker daily to make watches I can integrate all of these items without using Tasker as I never have. What are the advantages of Tasker over the default Watchmaker elements which would make the same or similar watch,WatchMaker,czx84d7,2,t5_347l3

6727771,0,t1_d0f6txl,I recognize it isnt an ideal solution since it doesnt effect apps but with an amoled screen like on my Huawei watch I believe that darkening the face with a black overlay ultimately has the same effect as reducing the brightness since each of the oled pixels actually emit less light when set to be darker.  Also I dont have tasker but Ill check it out.  Thanks for the tip.,WatchMaker,d0f7kw6,1,t5_347l3

7420010,0,t3_4gq9ra, Ive been fiddling with similar ideas. I would suggest setting up a lines of text then give the text values the dht and dmat for hours and minutes and set each text a rotation value appropriate for their operation drh drmWith Watchmaker v.. you can adjust these values easily. Or if you dig up the xml file youll edit a bit of code like this     ltLayer typetext                x                y                gyro                rotationdrh                skewx                skewy                opacity                alignmentcc                textdht                textsize                animscalex                animscaley                fontRobotoRegular                transformn                colordimffffff                colorffffff                displaybdgtFortunately mostly all of this is on a programming scale fairly easy to understand. Everything is in the wiki too.if you want the text to stay upright as it rotates then itll require some wacky AND OR statements Im not prepared to detail. Good luck.,WatchMaker,d2lluxx,1,t5_347l3
8128153,0,t3_4n024t,Also there is source code on the web for converting lonlat to UTM MGRS coordinate system. You could with some effort transliterate this code into LUA and run it in Watchmaker.,WatchMaker,d4toeun,1,t5_347l3
8974276,0,t3_52wkdh,I see from this post a year ago that there is a bug in the step counter so this is pretty frustrating to me as a good portion of the reason I got the watch was to track steps in place of my fitbit.,WatchMaker,d7qklxx,1,t5_347l3
10296806,0,t3_5ndmxi,Writing it in the watch face may be better if you dont want an extra program running in the background of your phone or installed at all. You could calculate your average calories based on your weight average heart rate and total steps. You could even include a script for heart rate if your watch has a heart rate monitor.,WatchMaker,dcb75zx,1,t5_347l3
