4552647,0,t3_3cwqo8,I assume multiplayer would be only for VS. Its the only one with the multiplayer tab anyway. I think itll be something like the ally shifters but using alliance members heroes for VS. Or maybe itll be a totally new type of VS for alliance like those boss raid that will be sooooooo awesome!Anyway looking forward to its release end of this month.
