And since there is nothing crooked or perverse to such a person on this account he sees an abundance of peace in all the Scriptureseven those that seem to contain a contradiction and to be opposed to one another...Armitage RobinsongtTo the man who is both ways a peacemaker there is no longer anything in the Divine oracles crooked or perverse for all things are plain to those who understand and since to such an one there is nothing crooked or perverse he sees abundance of peace everywhere in Scripture even in those parts which appear not to agree and to be contradictory to one another. But there is also a third peacemaker he viz. who shows that what to the eyes of others seems like disagreement in the Scriptures is not really so and who proves that harmony and concord exist whether between the Old and the New or the Law and the Prophets or Gospel and Gospel or Evangelists and Apostles or Apostles and other Apostles. For according to the Preacher all the Scriptures words of the wise are as goads and as nails well fastened words which were given from collections from one shepherd and there is nothing superfluous in them. And the Word is one shepherd of things relating to the Word which do indeed sound discordant to those who have not ears to hear but are in truth most harmonious.ANCFgtBlessed are the peacemakers. ... To the man who is a peacemaker in either sense there is in the Divine oracles nothing crooked or perverse for they are all plain to those who understand. And because to such an one there is nothing crooked or perverse he sees therefore abundance of peace in all the Scriptures even in those which seem to be at conflict and in contradiction with one another. And likewise he becomes a third peacemaker as he demonstrates that that which appears to others to be a conflict in the Scriptures is no conflict and exhibits their concord and peace whether of the Old Scriptures with the New or of the Law with the Prophets or of the Gospels with the Apostolic Scriptures or of the Apostolic Scriptures with each other. For also according to the Preacher all the Scriptures are words of the wise like goads and as nails firmly fixed which were given by agreement from one shepherd and there is nothing superfluous in them. But l the Word is the one Shepherd of things rational which may have an appearance of discord to those who have not ears to hear but are truly at perfect concord. For as the different chords of the psalter or the lyre each of which gives forth a certain sound of its own which seems unlike the sound of another chord are thought by a man who is not musical and ignorant of the principle of musical harmony to be inharmonious because of the dissimilarity of the sounds so those who are not skilled in hearing the harmony of God in the sacred Scriptures think that the Old is not in harmony with the New or the Prophets with the Law or the Gospels with one another or the Apostle with the Gospel or with himself or with the other Apostles. But he who comes instructed in the music of God being a man wise in word and deed and on this account like another Davidwhich is by interpretation skilful with the handwill bring out the sound of the music of God having learned from this at the right time to strike the chords now the chords of the Law now the Gospel chords in harmony with them and again the Prophetic chords and when reason demands it the Apostolic chords which are in harmony with the Prophetic and likewise the Apostolic with those of the Gospels. For he knows that all the Scripture is the one perfect and harmonised instrument of God            which from different sounds gives forth one saving voice to those willing to learn which stops and restrains every working of an evil spirit just as the music of David laid to rest the evil spirit in Saul which also was choking him. You see then that he is in the third place a peacemaker who sees in accordance with the Scripture the peace of it all and implants this peace in those who rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a genuine spirit. ,UnusedSubforMe,d6doyez,1,t5_39sra
