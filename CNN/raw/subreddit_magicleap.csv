Maybe any book if it can manage the high resolution masking required to remove the words from the physical book.Also hand axe totems would be the ultimate ironic turn for technology. And with all Ronys talk about technology working with physiology basing totems on a tool invented by prehomosapian sapian homonids makes some sense.

8181975,1,t1_d50abnw,Yep! At least four years ago Apple was already messing with presumably iPhone powered augmentedmixed reality headsets that other companies havent even been able to get in the hands of developers yet. They also own what me a layman would say is the patent on GearVR and Google Cardboard  That patent is from  just a year after iPhone was released.Apple isnt only in the game they are way way ahead of it. In  just one year after patenting an AR headset Apple goes and buys PrimeSense presumably for their incredible technologies in hand tracking and world mapping. Apple has the hardware Aseries chips and motion processors and platform experience needed to be way way ahead of everyone else out there by now. Its going to be an exciting year or two as the competition really heats up and consumers are able to get their hands or some sort of Augmented Reality headset.,magicleap,d50ap29,-1,t5_32wxt

The only question is how many discrete depths of field can the machine do and does this come close enough to trick the human brain into believing that the light field is real.

9604676,0,t1_d9wapq1,gtI think you hit it right on the head. Google has bought Magic Leap to attach a story to their version of augmented reality. It helps that Magic Leap has a unique ish? display technology but Google had to escape the perception of Google Glass and a camera on every temple that they thought was right.Google has a story as company its transhumanism. AR VR AI robots brain upload etc. fit all into that. I meant that Magic leap was born because the technology already existed in similar form as MagicBook before and they had access to the technology. I dont think theyd have developed this from the ground up having only the story or vision in place. ,magicleap,d9wz15f,1,t5_32wxt

9786226,0,t1_dajb1q3,Why are you so suspicious of me and no ML? FYI I make nothing on any clicks on my blog.  Most products that the layperson thinks comes out of nowhere are actually refinements on what people in the industry already understands. It is just that the big winner puts them together better than everyone else.  There are huge technical holes in what ML is doing yet no one has pointed them out to now. There are just a lot of puff pieces in the media talking about how wonderful it will be.  ,magicleap,dajd5zq,2,t5_32wxt
9787286,0,t1_daje2rv,Good questions.  I have a lot of reasons to doubt that they have perfected the FSD.  I think there is a  change that they have a high resolution FSD working.  They probably only have low resolution and very distorted versions working as it is an extremely difficult problem even if they could get the scanning to work which I highly doubt they would then have to control the lasers to a degree that nobody has before.  Then not only would they have to perfect the low resolution FSD but then they would have to perfect the Dynamic Region Resolution DDR drive to get any decent resolution out of it. There are a series of dominos that start to fall without a cheap and very small FSD. They are back to using the technologies that everyone else is using most likely LCOS with a chance they would use DLP or MicroOLED. This means their resolution is the same or less than everyone else. I expect that Hololens will be moving on to p with their next generation.  What I dont see is how they are going to support optically focus planes each focus plane requires the ability to display a complete image for this they need to either generate the images time sequentially the cheapest and smallest option or via multiple displays big and expensive.  LCOS and OLEDs will have a hard time generating more than two independent images at hz  per frame and DLP could maybe do double that or more if you accept much lower color depth bitspixel color  leading to contouring.It could very well be that ML has punted on the whole optical focus plane concept.  The alternative is to measure the focus of the eye andor the two pupil locations and then generate the image with blur based on computed distance accordingly. But then Microsoft Hololens and others are likely working on this too.   ,magicleap,dajhv6h,1,t5_32wxt

9924541,0,t1_db13c1m,I agree with you. I think technology and display wise it wont be a much of a difference between ODGs new glasses and Magic Leaps but ODG and Visux and all those companies dont target consumers. Magic leap does and if they have the tracking right and arrive sometime next year they will this generation. But its allways worth looking out for MS and Apple.

9993107,0,t1_dba2gm3,LCOS has very low persistence which is why it can support field sequential color. The problem comes when you have it supporting focus planes as well and the color repeat rate drops. Support field sequential focus planes also increases the lag. These two factors combine is why I think having focus planes by ML is a bad idea. OLEDs have the advantage that they display RGB at the same time on every pixel so they dont have to worry about FSC breakup. The downside is that they have bigger pixels and their cost is a lot higher for a microdisplay for use in a near to eye ARMR application. Because Oculus does not have a see through display it does not have to worry about getting the image into a combinerwaveguide which would requires a microdisplay. They just put a couple of lenses in front of a flat panel. Meta  shows how big the optics get if you try and make a transparent display using a large flat panel. ,magicleap,dba4om6,3,t5_32wxt

10596481,0,t1_dczuf32,The downfall for DLP though is the use of lenses and hot lamps to project.  Laser projectors are always in focus and use very little power to create a projected lightlaser.  Also laser projector modules can be miniaturized much more than DLP since the DLP uses a screen type device that blocks light.
