You guys wash their clothes? Thats awesome! We cant do that because the washing machine and dryer are both up in the kitchen area and we cant be leaving every so often and checking to see if its done etc. Its supposed to be the cooks job but it never gets done. We also have a no personal items in the laundry policy but probably just because we dont get our regular laundry cloths bibs etc back in time.And yeah I hate days like that.  I had a parent ream me out well actually my coworker today because we had to send an infant home with a fever of . She argued that it was teething and its our district health units policy that anything over . cannot be attributed to teething.

5473339,0,t1_cwb9g8z,Thanks. I find the most stress comes from other educators preoccupied with fairness. My strong belief is that children should get what they need not all get the same. An effective supportive team makes such a difference. Not to say this little boy shouldnt have consequences but he should a be given the same chance as everyone else first and b the consequences need to try to move his mental health in a positive direction. Talk to your coworkers about this exact scenario and have discussions about it. Really in my opinion the kids are the least stressful part of the job when you have a good team. Make sure you go somewhere that is a good fit. ,ECEProfessionals,cwb9qvo,4,t5_2t05v

6864360,0,t1_d0udjz8,See I dont find it hilarious. They definitely misjudged the situation amp are now sharing his very real feelings with the world for their amusement. Some kids would have been happy with the surprise but many children prefer to be involved in decision making or at least be told what is happening so to be set up for one thing amp have things drastically change can be unsettling for some children. It could have been handled sensitively by the parents acknowledging they misjudged things but instead they laugh record amp share. Not really putting a childs emotional wellbeing first in this case.I agree with you that the most important thing is to set up amp manage expectations.

10115599,0,t3_5kev93,I have watched a few of your videos now and what I see is that they are visually entertaining for kids.  I feel however that its missing one big component that is a hallmark of best practice for kids and a reason Sesame St. is so successful interaction.  You need ways for children to sing along this song is not very singable.  You need a way for kids to movedance along with the song.   You also need to incorporate interaction with questions.  A host asking I found an egg which bird does it belong to?  The egg should correspond to the same color bird.  Give a pause in the video  seconds so children can shout the answer and then reveal it.  It will be more meaningful to kids than just mindlessly watching. Great start but I think that is the big piece you are missing. ,ECEProfessionals,dbq2jxs,2,t5_2t05v

If its for the class it could be a poster a tree  etc. that you and the whole class adds nice things to throughout the day. i.e. Oh I saw Jeremiah helping Sarah with her coat! Kindness trees are part of Conscious Discipline if you ever work with that.Or if that seems like a lot of work right now because I know were all busy maybe a personal gratitude journal? I write in one at the end of each day where I just write ish things down that I am grateful for that day. Sometimes I write just a word sometimes I write about something that happened. I thought it was silly when I started but it definitely makes me feel better. I like keeping specifically a gratitude journal rather than a general journalreflections journal because I find that I dwell on negatives in those. Maybe if you kept a running gratitude journal or scrap paper throughout the day?

10484754,0,t1_dcwhhfm,gt We cant go outside when the weather is F or below. Even if the children are appropriately dressed. I disagree with it but we cant change it due to licensing.Oh my goodness!  Is that something youve read for yourself in a licensing manual or something youve been told is a licensing rule by someone else?  A quick peek at your post history suggests that youre in Ohio which seems to be governed by these regulations  The regulations indicate that centers must have written policies regarding outdoor time  including limitations placed on outdoor play due to weather or safety issues.  Considerations may include but are not limited to temperature humidity wind chill ozone levels pollen count lightning rain or ice.  To me this means your center may have a policy stating you cant go outside when the weather is F or below but unless someone can show you that policy in writing I would be taking the children outside.  If someone tells you thats the policy and they cant change it because of licensing show them this document page .  It is absolutely within your centers power to change.gtWhen its not nap time I find myself to be very effective. The children typically listen to me and I enforce consequences equally. Its just that during nap these kids can get so loud that it keeps everyone from sleeping and then its just chaos. I think they know that I cant really do anything so Im at a loss at what to do.I find the same thing can happen to me during nap times too.  Especially when I am feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the children not listening.  Are you alone in the sleep room when this happens or are there multiple people trying to control the situation?  I always find it helps if I can close my eyes and count to ten silently to give myself a bit of a chance to regroup and calm down.  I really believe that the children feed off of our emotions and when were feeling overwhelmed and frustrated they have a hard time relaxing.,ECEProfessionals,dcwk0qh,4,t5_2t05v

One thing I may add is not allowing killing at school. No killing bugs in real life. No pretending to kill. I dont like restricting the play of the children but if Im going to restrict anything its killing. I always say We dont kill. Or We dont pretend to kill at school. That scares your friends I wont let anyone scare you so I cant let you scare anyone else. If they know what death is start a conversation around that and why you dont allow killing.
