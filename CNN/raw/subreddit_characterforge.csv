10402633,0,t1_dcmumrm, Aradias potion and herbology skills put her far above Seren on this one. Not only does Saren not cook shes been trained to subsist on military rations and even then can barely do the miniscule amount of cooking required for them. Serens Welsh which is halfway to Scottish already s but maybe not?. But Aradias disguise magic could convince you she was Connery. Aradia has ancestors in s Berlin and he could convince them with her magic that shes from the future and ask a loan. The Frsts have always been a superstitious bunch. Seren could pull some superdickery and crack open a bank Vault if she could rationalise to herself that the reality shes in isnt real classic superdickery tactic.,characterforge,dcn7elq,2,t5_3enf1
10403721,0,t3_5ov2le,Alright. This sounds fun. The setting is somewhat realistic scifi about two hundred years in the future with a bit of magic involved. Here are two characters. Lets just call this one the Red Mage because she doesnt have a name yet in the story. Shes somewhere around the rank of Admiral in their space navy. Besides being a brilliant tactician she has access to Sanguine magic which allows her to manipulate the four forces of nature with varying degrees of success and difficulty. This character is James True. Hes a monster hunter of the future. His job is to hunt and deal with space monsters that are causing problems for human colonies or space ships. His main item of power is his Venator armor which is pretty close to being an Iron Man suit excluding the flight or the weapons. As in it gives him short bursts of extreme strength speed and overall incredible resilience along with a super advanced AI system. Think a Witcher in the year .Also while Im all up for silly situations I would actually really appreciate an actual serious situation in the suggestions because I need to write more of those to flesh out their characters,characterforge,dcnbujy,2,t5_3enf1

10512250,0,t1_dcz2x8l,Lilith Ive wanted to be a student in the Citadel ever since I first heard that it had the grandest library in the entirety of the continent.  Its a place of knowledge and learning and no other place could compare. No I do not often miss my home and people.  I am one of many siblings because Lamia are born in large batches and it is so commonplace for us to go out on our own its something that is taken for granted.  Though I do sometimes worry that my siblings are in more dire situations than I am. Assuming that everyone at the Citadel treats me like a human on this free day?  I would spend the entire day studying with the astronomy and poisonmaking mentors.Adelphos The prophesy seems very vague in my opinion.  But they are both really good at what they do so I guess that I have no room to insult it. Other magic specifically? Fire and Wind magics.  Other strength?  Just being stronger in general would be great. Being a guard is a good way to grow and mature as a person you are responsible for the people around you so you have to push yourself to become better at being aware of the world around you and improve your ability to deal with threats.,characterforge,dczobr9,2,t5_3enf1
10542057,0,t1_dd30r04,To Tara Thats just what I expect a disgusting Earth woman to say.  How do you choose your successor then? Youve been oppressed so the key way to free your people from your oppressors is through attack your enemys weak points.  Specifically noncombatants.  More specifically children and hospitals.  What are your thoughts on that? A light...bulb?  Sounds weird.  Break it end the research on it kill everyone involved.

10617122,0,t1_ddavaeg, Not sure I could call it sort of life but we become one with the Sun. No. They are danger to us who must be wiped out. I did have some conversations with more calm heathen and heretics though.  It would be too long but I will try to give easily understandable summary.At the beginning there was Void that consumed all but within it the Sun came to being and filled this World with Light and Warmth.But alone the Sun was lonely and wished for company.Thus planets the direct offsprings of the Sun came into being. We record our own history next to our ancestors and try to preserve a bit of our remains in hopes of someday meeting others from stars one day. I was. But back then I was really young and it was only thing they taught me. Personal favorite is spheres that seems to be globes of other worlds our ancestors seemed to have visited or even lived. I hope we can someday go there somehow.,characterforge,ddb2qnl,2,t5_3enf1

10722899,0,t1_ddlwq1f, That young kid has spirit. You have to remember if the princess wouldnt have forbidden him to drink the water I would have easily accomplished my mission. My backup plan was to simply kill those who were not affected by it. He outsmarted me and honestly? After he told me that he agrees with me that there should be equality amongst all races but also that he explained to me that forcing a change from the outside would only be a continued circle of oppression. Changing it from the inside however might work. Ive seen a passion in that kid Ive last seen in the mother of my children. She was a peaceful protestor and died during the birth of my last child. Besides I did work hard its just that I am not the youngest anymore but I was still too much of a coward to turn this assassination into suicide attacks. After all I wanted to see my children.  No although humans compared parts of my race to the extinct Panthera specimen that lived in their old world. Indeed I have features that can compare to that of a lion but there are entirely different reasons for it. My hair for example has such a structure that it keeps me warm even if I became wet. Originally my race is from a cold country that has now been occupied by Ashaitans. Sadly they realised quite early that we were way better workers in the cold than they could possibly be.  I know the fact that some youngling has bested me speaks against it but I was a quite efficient and feared fighter in my early days. Until I met my wife I was restless and fought a lot. I actually met the king more than once but every single time he got away from me. I guess he only trusted me to do the job. ,characterforge,ddlzkbh,2,t5_3enf1

My vendors all over the Lock District have my respect and I have theirs see.gt  Have you ever considered replacing your other arm and your legs with robot parts as well?I think one lost limb is good enough. It hurt like hell and is pretty inconvenient at times to be honest. Its kinda preventing me from visiting places like the Aria Desert or southern Xia. Too hot. Sad.gt  Yeah but there are a lot of thieves. Doesnt it seem a little too generic?I think of it like a medal of honor to be honest like the Class System considers me so good at my past profession that I basically represent it in its entirety. Its very flatterin to be honest.Rosegt  Have you ever been discriminated against for being from Lizhang?Hmm over the last few years I don think so. I sometimes get people who meet me at the Class HQ or Capital City asking wow your accent is verwy weird or is your hair color natural? But aside from that not really. Gaia has been very accepting of others over the last decade or so an I think its all great though there is some confusion every now and again. Just give it time I suppose.gt  Is there a high risk of Ash dying?Oof I dont like thinking about that much but I dont think so. Xia has been in a relatively peaceful state since... youknowwhat and Ash is basically like a security guard right now. Its just business and if something actually bad happened again Id be verwy surprised.gt  What is your favorite meal?Hmm... crystal vermicelli in tomatopumpkin soup with beefr. Not very healthy I suppose haha but I like it a lot. Pretty simpo to make too.,characterforge,ddy9ntf,2,t5_3enf1
10856880,0,t3_5v6l81,Miranda Teller was born on the Planet Minerva in . When she was ten her father Orwell Teller financed the Colony ship to the most recently discovered habitable world. When the ship landed Orwell named the planet Miranda after his daughter. Miranda the person enrolled in the United Earth Federation Navy when she was  where she went through boot camp with her childhood friend Chloe Verhoeven. They served together until they married in  after which Miranda left the Navy to follow her father into politics becoming the regional governor of Mirandas capitol district. She served as governor until the breakout of the Human Civil War where she reenlisted as an intelligence officer. Across the  years of the Civil War she became intimately familiar with both UEF and CounterSolar Faction secret projects and superweapons and used her connections as a politician to leak mutually damaging info on higherups of both sides which later on was critical in assuring the peace between the UEF and CSF dissonants after both sides became disillusioned with the two leaderships throwing cannon fodder at each other. CSF extremists refused to make peace and detonated a massive dirty bomb at the Miranda Planetary capitol building killing Orwell and a half billion others almost instantly. Miranda resigned from the military again and returned to public service organising rescue efforts and refugee aid. When the next planetary election occurred Miranda won the vote for Planetary Governor by a landslide by writein having become massively popular among the citizenry for all of the work she had done during and after the war. She served as Planetary Governor for  years winning each election with at least a  margin and only losing the position because the planet itself had been deterraformed by the reestablished CSF. She once again organised rescue efforts and refugee aid while also staying close by to her wife who had become The Grand Admiral of the navy of the government which had replaced the UEF the Central Galactic Government.When the President of the CGG resigned unable to take the stress of a Galactic War and his entire cabinet was assassinated by CSF terrorists Chloe was unwillingly promoted to President and Miranda to First Lady though Chloe continued to function as Grand Admiral while Miranda picked up the bulk of the job of the President. And thats where they are today trying to resist the massive technological advantage of the terrorist Faction not knowing they specifically were being targeted for their treasons against the UEF thousands of years earlier.,characterforge,ddzt6vf,3,t5_3enf1

11318034,0,t1_dfettpx,No you pretty much said what I was thinking.  The personality was inconsistent and your having your cake and eating it critique summarized what I felt.  On a first read surface level the characters personality is being edgy because being a tortured soul is cool.If that isnt what you want then look at what was already said.  I say it is sound advice for fleshing out the character.  Being depressed wont make him a bad character it is bad if it is an isolated part of his personality until the plot tells him it is affecting him.I think something that might help flesh him out is thinking of what the best case scenario would be.  What is the best outcome the character can reasonably hope for and how can they reach it.,characterforge,dfevpir,1,t5_3enf1
11628699,0,t3_65pbjy,I have a bunch of questions about the family dynamics. Why were the parents only around to raise the first two kids and not the rest? How do the kids raised by other people feel about this? Do they resent their parents for not being around are they jealous of the oldest brothers? Im especially interested in the relationship between Jane Kody and July after Kodys banishment does he resent Jane for getting what he couldnt? How does Jane feel about the whole thing? What about July since she was raised by them?Do the kids besides the twins have powers? How did Kody mess up on his rite of passage? Is messing it up in any way going to lead to banishment or did he in particular just screw up so spectacularly that an exceptional punishment was needed? ,characterforge,dge4j1z,2,t5_3enf1
