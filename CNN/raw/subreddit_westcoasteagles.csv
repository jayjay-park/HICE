2064892,0,t3_2ihttr,Varcoe would be a great pickup but Im far from confident we could secure the deal.Hes got a couple of kids and his family and friends are all in Victoria would have to be a significant offering for him to move.Perfect fit for our midfield seasoned footballer played every game last season has speed and good foot skills.,westcoasteagles,cl2akbv,3,t5_2xeg2
3135358,0,t1_comyxod,For sure! Considering he does everything on the sub it would be hard to replace him. Glad to have solved this mystery!,westcoasteagles,comz694,1,t5_2xeg2
3545588,0,t1_cpwcd93,Just from the NAB games I dont rate Nelson anywhere near as high as the club seems to. If someone like Bennell misses out for him in round one I think that would be a bad move.,westcoasteagles,cpwf4is,2,t5_2xeg2
3609677,0,t1_cq3q23m,Haha me too. I was loving that game against GC. Ive always felt bad for Watts he never looked like he had any confidence but he looked really solid in that game.,westcoasteagles,cq3q9vw,3,t5_2xeg2

3712429,1,t3_32x6y1,Gotta love how defending your team or players against obvious media bias is enough to drive some of our fellow raflers downvote crazy.  But its good to get some irritation off the chest now and again though.  Have to admit Im surprised at the reaction.  Expected more folks to agree with the obvious proof of bias.  Oh well.,westcoasteagles,cqffxeg,-1,t5_2xeg2
4051363,0,t1_cri1j8a,Brants a cm big bodied midfielder who is still only . Ive been one of those campaigning for his addition to the side but with Hutchings and Selwood back in and Rosa still to come hes probably just missed out for now. Hes averaged  disposals in the WAFL and kicked bags of goals but his disposal efficiency hasnt always been great and his consistency is one of the main things holding him back at this stage. At  years old hes still got a lot to offer and plenty of time to do to it should feature at some point later this year and then resign to get more of a chance in the coming years.McInnes is still quite raw but it isnt just his marking and goalkicking that hes bringing to the side but a bit of structure. Simpson said after the Port game that having him in the team gave us a few extra goals and that it freed up Kennedy a lot as well. Having said that Darling can do that job much better and it should be a straight swap when he returns.,westcoasteagles,cri34te,3,t5_2xeg2
4182354,0,t1_crw9mev,I think well have to get a lot more game time into Darling before hes back.Missing all of preseason is a big one but Darling has always had a big engine plays like a  year old even when he was still a teenager. Still need regular game time into McInnes if Kennedy goes down.,westcoasteagles,crwzpi6,3,t5_2xeg2
4193797,0,t1_cryaeuu,Im more saying that Duggan seems to have surpassed Colledge Hutchings drafted from  and Sheed .,westcoasteagles,cryahkl,3,t5_2xeg2

4465645,0,t3_3c9nfz,Based on skill the Eagles should win this but saying this is an ordinary match is as far from the truth as possible. I have quite literally no read on this match other than it will probably be the most emotional game Ive ever watched ,westcoasteagles,cstklki,8,t5_2xeg2

4678464,0,t1_ctjsfju,Eh so one or two might have smoked a joint in the off season I couldnt care less about that. If they were using during the season that is another kettle of ice. ,westcoasteagles,ctk9odh,3,t5_2xeg2
4759517,0,t1_cttg5xs,gt The problem is hes a terrible footballer who can barely perform any role let alone this one.Quite the setback for a professional footballer that particular ailment is P,westcoasteagles,ctuhdnl,3,t5_2xeg2

5084754,0,t1_cuyuwlm,Absolutely.  Weve been rightly criticised for laying soft tackles in the past.  At least last night they stuck.  ,westcoasteagles,cuywmhd,2,t5_2xeg2

7712433,0,t3_4kymqy,If we are to be short players then this is the week for it. Very much want Brown back so we can swing the Governator forward to fuck with opposition coachs heads.  A forward line mix with Kennedy Le Cras Darling alternating from midfield to CHF a resting LycNat and a popup McGovern with Cripps and Hill buzzing around at ground level would be a tough outfit to counter. Just need Sheed back for midfield depth now. And more away wins boys please. ,westcoasteagles,d3iunrk,3,t5_2xeg2

11091835,0,t3_5xx5gh,gtHow is Adam Simpson going as coach? Are we happy with his progress and his abilities as head of the team?   Simmo is God. GF delivery and the much talked about brand of footy we play has been generally terrific under his tutelage.   Someone mentioned that when things go awry he doesnt have a Plan B but I think its more of a case of the players being unable to adjust either because theyre not good enough or just dont figure things out quick enough.  I thought we were better in  at fighting games to the end and maintaining a contest even when we lost than we were in  but  will show whether thats all in my imagination or not.   gtWhat games in the  fixture are you most looking forward to and why?   Anything against Hawthorn. I know it wont count for much but if we can hurt them hard in Victoria with club legend Sam Mitchell in our side I will be able to live off the tears of my Hawthornloving friends for eons.   gtWhat were your favorite and least favorite moments from  specific highlights favorite games a new star being born etc    Barrasssssssssssssss so young so much upside learning from the Governator down back. It warms the everloving shit out of my heart.  Also Jono Giles when he got going was a pleasant surprise.  As for least favourite moments... Getting knocked out first round stung.,westcoasteagles,dep8zxp,2,t5_2xeg2
