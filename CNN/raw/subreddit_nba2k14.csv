188594,0,t3_1w91qs,Try being on the Hawks as a point guard no one can score a basket so no assists and you have to win every game yourself. I average  points a game because my team is horrible,nba2k14,cezx53w,1,t5_2x0gp
226838,0,t3_1w1ttb,sorry. just had to comment on this again.The camera spinning is the most fucking ridiculous thing ever in a video game.  At least in NCAA football the game basically pauses for a second while the rotation happens. Why the fuck would I bust my ass to pick off a pass and instead of going in for a major dunk to have some fun with this fucking GAME I take  steps in the opposite direction wait for the defense to get there then do a layup or pass.  This bug actually ruins the game for me.Whoever put this in the game is a fucking retard. End of story.,nba2k14,cf49c4u,1,t5_2x0gp
