One of my pigs was sneezing and had heavy breathing for a while and I thought it was a URI. It turned out to just be a cold but we put her on antibiotics anyways just in case it developed into a URI. I would suggest antibiotics just to be safe and Vitamin C! Hope your pig gets well soon! ,guineapigs,cejd317,2,t5_2rqn4

The male we kept redpig was separate but next to the girls. We could tell he was lonly. Sitting next to the girls threw the cage was not enough. So we had him neutered and after a month we introduced him to the the girls. And they all for the most part are friends.  Hes a very low key pig anyways. What area are you in?

1480744,0,t3_2b3gu6,Looks similar to ringworm to me. It generally starts on the ears or around the eyes when it comes to piggies. You can try using athletes foot cream on it if you want but if its mites or something else that wont help.

1528163,0,t3_2bn0zg,Had a pig do that for a while. She had it for over  months. Over time it went away. Two things come to mind. First guess is he got some dust or piece of hay particle up his nose and just has a runny nose to clear it.My second guess is it is an upper respiratory infection. Treating with vet prescribed Baytril does the trick of getting rid of it. Spot clean the dirty areas a little more frequently during this time.Something that happens from time to time. Its gone away so hes fine. If it keeps recurring and youre still concerned call the vet office before hand and ask if one of their vets can see a guinea pig. Visit will probably cost ish  liquid Baytril.  Syringe feeding them the nasty tasting Baytril will make them upset with you. Give them a tasty treat and lots of love afterwards.

1691959,0,t3_2dozj9,How old is he? If hes a bit older he might not know how to act with another male  so if youre willing to spend the money to neuter him and get him a female I think that would prevent a lot of frustration this is just my experience so I cant say this is exactly whats going to happen with yours but as someone said you wont know until you try. I had this same issues with my piggy. Heres my story if you want to read it Last year I was basically handed off a guinea pig that someone didnt want. He was about  years old and we had no clue on the care of the guinea pig.  After tons of research I saw that they need companions  so I decided on getting him one.  I first tried a local petco and brought him home.  They seemed to be getting along great until a month passed by  and all of a sudden they started teeth chattering at each other and before we could react they were fighting and in the end one drew blood.  So  we had to take the petco one back because we read once they draw blood theyll never get along.  So we waited a few months and then went through a guinea pig rescue that was about an hour away  and basically the same thing happened.  My pig would be head over heels the first month or so and then start fights afterwards. We tried this with  different pigs from the rescue. We were so frustrated because he seemed so happy at first.  In the end we decided to neuter him and now he has  female companions!  Hes in heaven no doubt  and its been a good  months and they all get along great. ,guineapigs,cjsfoev,0,t5_2rqn4

3227948,0,t1_cowkpnu,Critical Care is a powder Oxbow makes which is basically all your piggies nutrients in a powder form. You mix it with water or water and a tbsp of sugar free apple sauce into a gruel and syringe feed it to you piggie. Its also good for rabbits mice chinchillas and other herbivores. I was feeding this to Squeekers while waiting for him to eat on his own. That gruel you make sounds similar and would probably do in a pinch if you dont have Critical Care. But I thought you were doing both your gruel and Critical Care to keep your piggie fed until he ate again. ,guineapigs,cowkxws,2,t5_2rqn4

Please be aware that not all vets are well versed in exotics. The vet should do a scraping to check for mites and then an injection of Ivermectin. The guinea pig will need a few treatments over the next several weeks. The topical meds for this like Revolution only seem to work if it is a very light case.

5862674,0,t3_3vhzs6,Actually I have had great luck socializing smaller pigs and older pigsnever did two babies and one older but the same might apply.  Introducing two pigs more or less the same size has always been harder.  I figure its because they are hierarchical and if more equal in sizeweight they are likelier to fight.A broad imbalance seems to mean that the old pig is already the winner and doesnt have to do more than an initial session or two of laying down the law.  The little guys accept this usually so everyones happy.  Since weve had mostly males there does come a point where the little dude becomes an adolescent and starts challenging the old guy but by then they almost always have a great relationship.  YMMV but my take is that babies and old pigs can be introduced successfully.  ,guineapigs,cxo4kod,1,t5_2rqn4

Assuming you handle them regularly and correctly its my experience that generally they are much more docile than other pocket pets.

6040382,0,t1_cyb93iw,you most likely wont be able to tell if its unhappy.Firstly because you wont know it very well  if you had had it for years and its friend died then you would know its emotions more.secondly they are prey animals so they try not to show unhappiness pain or disability.this is copied and pasted from another post I made beforeI agreed to take on a pig that had had a friend die. Because of the distance and lack of transport it took about a month to get her so she was alone for all that time. Her owner gave her to me soley because she did not want her to live alone.She had to be quarantined at first. You would not have known this pig was unhappy in any way because she acted normally and cuddled she ate fine.When we introduced her to our little herd she had such a change of character and you could instantly see how much happier she was. Since seeing that I have felt really really strongly about the subject because when pigs are unhappy they dont show it so much and when you are interacting with them in that moment they are happy so you dont see that they are lonelyPlease reconsider. It is not harder or much more expensive to have two rather than three. Please dont make your guinea pig live a lonely life.

6921030,0,t3_4aje8r,Yesterday Marshie had a minor operation to remove a sebaceous cyst on his right rear. Heres a pic of the aftermath  note this is a picture of a wounded allwhite guinea pig. I didnt include it in the OP in case it might upset someone to see even though it came from the vetMarshie has had a lump here since as long as Ive had him and as it hadnt been causing him any pain or enlarging Ive just been keeping a close eye on it and feeling it every time I had him out of the cage. I felt that it may have enlarged a bit in the past week or so and decided to take him in. Other than the lump the vet reported hes in very good health and were all optimistic for an uneventful recovery. No stitches so no cone of shame but I do have to keep him separate from Penny for a few days until it heals enough. As soon as I got him home and installed the temporary divider in the cage they both ran to each other and started trying to break down the wall with their teeth. And theyve been trying off and on continuously all day rumblestrutting with his nose stuck through the cage holes.. I guess if hes more interested in doing that than messing with his wound I should be happy lolShe actually did a really nice job. Had it enlarged much more it would have been a lot more difficult to remove and required a lot more wound care. As it is she was able to keep a skin flap pretty well intact so it should heal nicely. ,guineapigs,d10tmcn,9,t5_2rqn4

7550812,0,t3_4iqtki,Dont use any pet store cages they are way too small for two pigs. Read this Getting a guinea pig from someone else that comes with their own cage is probably a bad idea because the pigs scent will be all over it and it will cause friction between the pigs. Its better to get a cage that neither of them has had time to get used to. Guinea pigs dont usually fight if they dont get along one will end up bullying the other a lot and theyll both be unhappy but its really unlikely that theyll seriously injure each other. As long as no blood is drawn and both pigs are able to get to their food and water dont interfere with their dominance behavior. Have them meet on some blankets or something with some hay and veggies so they can get to know each other before putting them both in their cage. If they dont get along try giving them both a bath at the same time that sometimes helps. Make sure you know the pigs sex so you dont end up with a bunch of babies. If theyre both male they both need to be neutered or else they could fight. ,guineapigs,d30hovj,7,t5_2rqn4

8933764,0,t3_52n31o,A new environment means new smells and new noises. Guinea pigs dont have the best vision so they rely heavily on their other senses. You might not notice that when you walk in your new home it sounds slightly different but they do. Or the paint on the walls adds just a bit of difference in the smell of the room but they do. They are going to need time to adjust it may take a few days or a few weeks. Eventually they will learn the squeak of the flooring and the clicking of the ac starting up. Give them lots of veg and love they will come around.,guineapigs,d7lpfwr,4,t5_2rqn4

Clean their bottles food bowls and launder the fleece and cuddleecups with un scented detergents. Their were no symptoms leading up to death except hearing some squeaks before they died. There is only one person that lives in the house and he knows how to handle a guinea pig. I was thinking something in the house could be killing them since their is no symptoms and they are all dying the same way by just dropping dead.
