141147,0,t3_1vp46d,i actually have to agree with katz on this one. St.Louis went through  more bad years than we have since we started the rebuild. i know its been  years since the playoffs but  of those yearswe tried to make the playoffs and we spent to the cap. these last  have been the true rebuild where we trade eveyone and tank. k lowe isnt a puppet master. mact has been aquiring pretty good players for a st year gm. i feel hes improved the depth of our organizations goaltending. hes smart.  i knew this year was shot when hall was lined up at center ice as the  guy.nuge and gags gone was brutal. Also our d werent gonna magically become playoff caliber players. dubnyk fell apart under the pressure tha fans and media put on him. bryzscrivensbachman and labarbra are all apparently bad goalies with no fault put on our D.were still figuring out the core players and i like that mact has been trying out our young guys in the NHL. Hes figuring out who belongs in the organization.katz is also right about how were developing players better now that we have a farm team.  the new scouting staff has done great the last few years.i know some moves by mact have been questionable but i still have faith in him and the organization. sometimes you have to take a step back before you move forward. Next year is the year that we need some solid improvement. we all know the years a write off. its time to quit acting like we have an NHL caliber roster and were mad at how theyre underperforming.

1259984,0,t1_cibafol,I will agree that Boychuk is more experienced but its not a big plus in my opinion unless he can serve as some sort of mentor which I have no idea if he is suited to that role. Also he is  which isnt that old but must be considered as Petry has just entered his prime production yrs at . I will agree that Boychuk is a better D as he fills D better than Petry but Boychuk had the benefit of playing with Chara and a far deeper defense corps. Sorry for the meandering but I would rather we not move laterally in regards to the D and instead trade from a position of strength which is wing. Instead of Petry for Schenn we should consider trading Perron. Before the downvotes come consider that we have  quality wingers possibly  if Gagner changed positions. Also wingers are less valuable and can be had more readily on the UFA market than Cs and Ds. Schenn is  and is on the cusp of his prime yrs after learning the ropes as a rookie. Perron just came off his best career year and we would be selling high so to speak. If we got Boychuk and Scheen for Perron and Gagner we just addressed our two biggest needs. CC would be set for the next few yrs at least and we would have two legit veteren NHL D who could log heavy minutes.

2095260,0,t3_2iwi67,Lots of people talk about trading Yakupov. Watching these highlights from the half season gives me chills. Tying rookie of the year Jonathan Huberdeau for points while beating him in goals in  season. Not only that but he topped the team in goals that year and his  was only  while Justin Schultz hit .The following season his play rapidly declined.   Justin Schultz  and Sam Gagner  for comparison is pretty bad but what would you attribute this with? I feel like Krueger just let Nail play his game and then when Eakins came in he totally altered the way the kid plays. Now Im not calling for Eakins job or anything and please do correct me if Im wrong but wouldnt it be better to let him go back to his  style of play? He always seemed clutch in his first season scoring big goals. Then in his second season he was basically sidelined playing rd line grind while his style is clearly top . Is there something Im missing? I watched almost every game for the past two seasons and obviously saw a big change under the two coaches... Ive written a post like this before but didnt get many responses.Finally if this season he finds his game again why would we trade him?

Maybe the Oilers have  shots in a game but that doesnt include  blocked shots and  attempts that were deflected wide. The Oilers Actually had  corsi events For in the above scenario.Generally youll see corsi expressed as a percentage. This is because its the percentage of the total corsi events for each team. I.e. if there are  shots total in a game and each team gets  then each team has  of the shots.Why is it important?For the same reason its important to out shoot your opponent. The theory goes If a team is shooting more then they have the puck more which should indicate superior play. This theory isnt exactly proven but what has been proven is that corsi correlates to success over long periods of time. This means that teams with poor corsi almost always end up losing games eventually while teams with good corsi almost always end up winning games eventually.Its not a perfect stat and theres plenty of work being done to find new more interesting metrics to use.,EdmontonOilers,clgjx09,2,t5_2rptq

2434722,0,t1_cmckhid,People keep saying Stop Opening Your Wallet but theres a problem with that statement.This is oil rich Alberta. Every company and their brother has seasons tickets. These companies give tickets away to people who may not normally get to go to Oil games so they show up and watch them lose because hey its all about the experience and I have nothing invested.I go to  games a year sitting in row  behind the away bench. I dont pay for tickets. My boss gives me his tickets when he cant go or cant find anyone else. Even if the Oilers lose  to Chicago Im taking those free tickets and going to the game.You want to know what my boss said about still having seasons tickets? Hes buying them so he can get first crack at tickets for the new arena.Its not so much about stop opening your wallet because half the people at the games are there with corporate seats.,EdmontonOilers,cmcmyrj,10,t5_2rptq

Its not like we expected them to shit the bed or Perry to become the player he is. I mean I dislike Lowe as much as the next person but that doesnt mean posting a  year old article is a valid reason to evaluate his decisions as a GM.Were the comedic relief the benchmark for shittiness so basically until the Flames continue to regress to where they should be i.e. where we are no one is going to give a fuck. Theyre the cinderella team this season along with Buffalo for rhockey. Doesnt matter how bad they play the Flames will get no bad attention because people thought they would be shit and they played well for  of the season. Regardless of how they play for the rest of the season hockey fans will fail to see it as a problem because they had a bit of success. I can almost guarantee if we started playing well people would chalk it up to us deciding not to tank anymore or something of the sort.I will give credit where credit is due though most Flames fans Ive seen while shitting on the Oilers do know that their success was remarkable and probably wasnt going to continue. There were still the douchecanoes but for the most part I think they were just enjoying the good hockey while it lasted.For me though as long as I keep commenting on rhockey I cant really complain.

3166376,0,t3_2wekj9,I mean Im on reading week and am a little bored. Did we want it to compare Eakins vs. Nelson with MacT time included or Eakins vs. NelsonMacT vs. Nelson?Also if I were to make it shouldnt take too long frankly whats the easiest way to share it?Edit Ill make it on excel right about now. am alcohol fueled spreadsheet. Fuck yeah.Edit  Im only going to take data from players who played for both coaches this season as that only make sense if thats okay. We have a few guys who played for one or the other. I can include them in the stats if wed like but if we want overall stats like goal increase or goals for vs. goals against increase or decrease if I can find that the players who played for one or the other may fuck with those results.Edit  This may take longer than anticipated due to sleep needs but Ill get it done.Edit  Its am. I think Im going about this the long way but I want to make sure I dont mess anything up. Got through Nuge Ebs and Halls stats. My plan right now is to compare the PPG average for each player and as a total between each coachcoaching set. May also evaluate the  change in scoring for the those contributing the most Eberle Hall Nuge Yak Pouliot Hall although that will be skewed heavily towards those who have played with Nelson more Hall is going to look like crap. Hes only scored  goal under Nelson but has  points in the  games so I may also do  change in PPG.I cant believe Im going to say this but SPSS may actually come in handy as fucking annoying of a program it is and as much as I hate it. I may also take some extra time to properly organize my data its pretty scattered and disorganized at the moment.Let me know if you guys have any specific pieces of data youd want me to look at. Point production will be rather limited between the data sets. Between the overall lack of production of the team and some players only playing for certain coaches the data is going to be a bit skewed. Itll work much better for guys like Eberle Nuge Yakupov Pouliot Purcell Schultz etc who have produced points and played for all  sets of coaches this year. With that said itll also give us a good indication of what impact both the new players and new coaches have had on the players who were on the roster from the beginning of the season.As a side note the MacTNelson coaching pairing data is going to nearly useless. They constitute an extremely small sample size  games all of which were losses but were also fairly high scoring games. Well just have to keep that in mind when comparing the results.If this works out well I may actually just update the charts after every game for the rest of the season and post them again when golf season starts up so we can have a better comparison. By then Nelson will have coached a similar number of games this season as Eakins and barring injuries a number of players will have played for both coaches for a similar amount of time.Like I said above please let me know if theres any specific comparisons you want me to do and Ill see if its possiblenot overly time consuming.,EdmontonOilers,coq6zay,7,t5_2rptq

3313810,0,t3_2xve40,I want to preface by saying that my coworkers and I have discussed this very topic extensively. We have developed a series of strategies and contingency plans directions wed like to see the team move in.Firstly rumours out of San Jose are that Thorton and Marleau are on their last legs out there. If things dont go well for them this year it has been said that management there could be looking to move the team in a different direction. Now Im not saying either would come here but Jumbo Joe would look good in between Hall and Yak. Leaving a second line of Pouliot Nuge and Ebs. Convincing him of that would be  of the problem.Secondly sign Roy and Keep Todd Nelson  unless  Babcock agrees to for some reason or another come here babs is the only exception. Its not worth wreaking what Nelson has built to bring in even a Jacques Martin Andy Murray or Randy Carlyes. Nelson is showing hes a team guy and Roy is like a coach on the ice. Even if Roy ends up playing third line left wing hes probably be doing it with Draisaitl and PurcellpakerinenPitlicksomeone. He could even slide up in case of injury and has shown he can play with Yak.Third Boychuck should be a focus. Buyout Nikitin sign Boychuck play him with Nurse if hes ready if not  its Boychuck. Other Dmen to try for Dan Girardi in New York. The Rangers will be looking to save some cap space I think a deal could be had here. Keep an eye on the Predators D situation  they have Weber Jones Franson and Ellis on the right side. I think one of the last three could be available at the right price but Id shoot for Jones. I dont think theyd part with Weber hes already been paid a good chunk of that front loaded deal and Jones will be due for a raise soon.Lastly goaltending. Id like to think Craig Anderson would be the perfect bridge player till Brossoit  lbs  in OKC with a . s and a . gga is ready. I would personally like to see Brossoit take one more year in the AHL then I think he could challenge for some playing time. Not start but challenge maybe make  starts. I saw him play for the oil kings. Hes got some potential Id like to see it get developed properlyIm not saying that with all these moves the oilers could even make it into the playoffs next year.

Now sure it wouldve been a mistake to trade the guy who entirely changed his approach to the game in the offseason and coupled with a highly regarded goalie coach has been in fine form and has really taken off behind a strong team that was in desperate need of competent goaltending. Realistically its likely that Devan needed to get traded discarded by Nashville and completely reevaluate what he was doing wrong in order to rebound the way he has. Its not realistic to assume that wouldve happened if he wouldve continued to be handed the starting job in Edmonton despite his play consistently showing he didnt deserve that spot. ,EdmontonOilers,cpodmev,10,t5_2rptq

Itll be sardine packed at the end of the game but its still the besteasiest way to get to and from the game.  If youre at WEM you can take a bus to the U lots of them go between them and then hop the LRT or you can just cab it.  Either way may take up to an hour the cab taking hopefully only about  minutes since itll be a Saturday and youll only really have to contend with the other traffic going to the game.There are a couple different entrances to Rexall.  If you want to see the Gretzky statue just follow the building around its hard to miss.  FoodBeer at Rexall is pricey but the beer hits pretty hard.  The lineups can be pretty long but generally move fast during intermissions.

3973309,0,t1_cr967jl,You need to understand the significance of what these stats imply because reading between the lines theres more to it than Schultzs numbers being higher therefore hes better.. Schultz is given the easiest possible competition and is paired with a defenseman far superior to him in Klefbom.  This is opposed to Petry who was the best defenseman on the team for most of the last two or three years was generally placed against the hardest competition and had nobody better than him to play with.. Same thing applies. Petry had to be THE guy for the team defensively and had to spend way more effort actually managing the defense and trying to shut down the opponents best lines whereas Schultz is played against chumps and gets top PP time to basically be a th or th forward on the ice where his defensive woes only lead to disgusting shorthanded goals against.. I never said Petry was doing great before this year but he had his upsides. Yes he was making giveaways a lot but fucks sake we were trying to develop him while simultaneously playing him against the best of the league of course hes going to give the puck away when hes a fish out of water.  We had no other option. With Schultz we have plenty of other options because hes seriously the worst defenseman we can put out there so we play him against the worst competition where his defensive incompetence doesnt get exposed so easily and his admittedly decent offense can shine a little.  Klefbom is in every single factor better than Schultz as a player but Schultz has less responsibility and gets even easier taskloads than the other bad Dmen i.e. Ference and Nikitin and as such his mental decision and probably coaching orders to just stop trying to defend and just score gives off the illusion of his utility.  Well be paying four million to keep this guy next year. Four fucking million.  Thats four Klefboms one Giordano or about ths a Karlsson.  Look me dead in the eye and tell me you think hes worth holding on to wasting more cap and more time having a sinkhole on defense  a position were already suffering at  JUST IN CASE he maaaaaybe turns out to not be dogshit.  The guys a bust whether its coaching his determination to improve or that maybe he was dominant in college because he didnt need to defend there either and now when he needs to learn how to play hes swamped.,EdmontonOilers,cr96v7c,2,t5_2rptq

4158717,0,t1_cruaby0,Its not just that he was a bad pick it happens but the thing is he was nowhere near the BPA at the time. I think most Oiler fans wanted Boone Jenner because we needed C depth as well and he was the th ranked NA skater in that draft. We took Musil because we needed D which is my point taking position over BPA. Very little people thought he was a good pick at  so Im not basing this off of hindsight bias. Plus having his dad on our scouting staff probably made him go a little higher than he shouldve which is another reason why most fans didnt like the pick. We shouldve done the smart thing and traded down if we wanted him.

Sekera and Oduya seem like they could be good options in free agency though. Yeah his drafting was just awful same with his cap management. Actually one thing he mentioned about drafting I cant remember his exact wording but it was about focusing on harder players and a certain emphasis on size. If his drafting record wasnt so abysmal it wouldnt be a problem but it sounded like how you end up with th line fringe players because of an over emphasis on grit. I think his trading record was pretty solid overall but Im still worried about his drafting and cap management in general.

4324557,0,t3_3aix7f,Assuming teams not named The Oilers take players in the order of Bob Mckenzies list here are my first and second choices for each position in the first two rounds. CSP  C  No shit.HM Literally impossible for him to have been taken.. Oliver Kylington  LD  He was ranked in the top  at one point but has started to fall. From what Ive heard his fall completely baffles Euro scouts and fans. Amazing skater with excellent puck movement abilities. One of my favourites from this draft. I think hed be a great pick at  and a steal if he somehow falls to  apparently not out of the question.HM Nick Merkley  CRW  High end play making center. Sounds like a Henrik Sedinesque player from what I understand. I dont think he gets this far.. Daniel Sprong  RW  Incredibly skilled winger. Arguably one of the most skilled players in the draft. Seems like a good bet with a solid development coach damn you Grand Rapids!. Also I took him as a late st in NHL a year ago because of his awesome name and he turned into a beast.HM Dennis Yan  LW   Solid twoway guy. Listed as a LW but its implied hes a center? Either way it sounds like he has a lot of untapped potential. If see him as a  Landertype player.. Mitchell VandeSompel  LD  High potential offensive defenceman. Also plays forward. An Eric Karlssontype player apparently. I get the feeling Detroit selects him. Vande Sompel is such a Detroit name.HM Rasmus Andersson  RD  Scouting report makes him sound like another Klefbom. Seems like a really solid defensive player with serious offensive upside. The only reason hes the HM instead of MVS is because I actually watched MVS play and was impressed.As you can probably tell Im biased towards high potential players as opposed to safe solid players.Holy fuck I love the draft.

4393534,0,t1_cskvs25,gt You mean in Nashville where despite being loaded with right shot defenseman they traded for another one at the deadline to get through an injury and barely put him on the ice once they got their boy back? His play didnt fall off in Nashville his ice time did. Wasnt on the power play was behind Jones and Webber for on ice time. Third pair guys not on the PP dont put up points. When their third Right shot Dman came back from an injury he got squeezed out even further because they wanted to go with the guy that had been in the system all year.I understand the circumstances in Nashville he was badly misused but the point of the poster above is that he can put up points but just ignored the last  games of the season to fit his narrative. Regardless my point is not his offense as Ive said but his play without the puck.gt And the Oil was repeat was a team built on skating. Not sure if you caught the trades the last couple days but everything they brought over was a tree on the back end.

Sekera is much better at that than Beauchemin. The aging defensive guys havent worked out for us. Ference Nikitin Foster Barker Sutton...And as far as next year goes like I said in another comment we have Purcell and Nikitin off the books which will give us enough room to deal with a Dman in next years FA class.

5378564,0,t1_cvz2kvm,I dont think thats necessarily true. For one we arent going to let through  shots every game but if we hover around  shots per game it should be decent enough. We have two goalies now who are capable of covering for a porous defence so on a rotation theyd get enough downtime to sustain those types of performances. Moreover as the season progresses our performances will improve. Both Chia and McLellan will make sure of that. Theyre both winners and know what it takes to get there. At this point Im honestly not worried at all. I think everyone thought we could pull a Colorado or Calgary out of the gates and that would have been awesome but this kind of start was to be expected. We finally have a management team in place who know what the team and the performances should look like and that is a much more valuable asset than any player on the ice. I also think that McDavid will start to express himself more on the ice now. Historically he has always needed that first goal to get the monkey off his back and begin playing more freely. Hopefully Yak stays on his line because I really liked the way they worked today.,EdmontonOilers,cvz67ax,5,t5_2rptq

5838870,0,t1_cxkzquj,I personally dont move RNH bc right now it makes no sense for either side. Sure the defense is better but now you got Drai Letestu Lander ??? as your center depth. And the Isles right now dont need centers they got a ton of them but they need to replace Hamonics .mins on the back end.If I was Chia? I wouldnt trade Klefbom not that it works well cap wise anyways next year for the Isles since theyre gonna be stuck with over M committed on both guys next year while KO probably walks and Hamonic is only owned .. Isles need the cap space for a few of their RFAs. And moving Klefbom for Hamonic is a lateral move you can even make arguments with adv. stats that Klefbom is more valuable.I personally dont like trading for UFAs. KO will definitely test the market so I doubt he agrees to an extension with anyone assuming he even wants to play here.

You do make some points about both guys being weak compared to your standard NHLer especially at centre and that costing our team puck possession when they take a faceoff. Also youre right that Nuge often opts to use his stick even in situations that call for use of the body. Fear of injury or too many memories of lost puck battles due to lack of size? Ive often thought back to that draft and wondered if the better pick wouldve in fact been Landeskog. Sure he isnt as high in points per game but hes more sturdy less injuries and Colorado certainly thinks he was the right pick. They made him their captain at  years of age. Apparently he brings a certain je ne sais quois that makes players around him better in addition to his own abilities. I disagree with the idea that Nuge is Gagner hes clearly better but I think its too harsh to lambaste ubigfatphony over the comparisons hes making. He has a point and its nice to see someone brave enough to eat their downvotes to make it. ,EdmontonOilers,cyi4yrq,1,t5_2rptq

6149567,0,t1_cyo99wu,The difference is Hall is turning into a top  LWer in the league. Hes not a generational talent but he isnt a generic st liner either. So your entire skill gets the C is kinda redundant at that point. CSP also hasnt been active with the team due to his LTIR. So he isnt a big of a presence to the team today as he was in October in comparison to Hall.Youre also forgetting that a lot of the time great hockey players  any other talent in any field ussually are great leaders. Theyre motivated and determined to win. It takes a lot of spirit to break into the NHL its unbelievable to be competing at the level Hall is both emotionally and physically. Basically the Toews Crosbys Ovis Benns Charas Getzlafs Zetterbergs Tavares Webers Sedins . . . I could go on and on but point being is talent usually carries good leadership characteristics as well.

They have a leadership in the dressing room problem its been this way for many years. They need to solve the problem now because its not just Nurse and Draisaitl that are going to be effected. McDavid will too. I know people dont want to believe it but the Oilers dont play for each other. Our team isnt a tight team. Todd Nelson told us flat out. He knew. This is a team led by selfish individuals who play selfish individual hockey and create a selfish individual atmosphere in the room. That attitude trickles down to the rest of the team. They think they care they lie to each other and to us. But you can see it in how little they do for each other on the ice and how stilted the office interaction is compared to other teams. These guys arent together.If Im not being clear enough the best way to help ALL of our young players succeed is for management to stop listening to people who only look at points and think skating fast  effort.

7087949,0,t1_d1jqxkn,gt Okay well if hes played that much with top  level centers then why is everyone complaining that he hasnt had his chances to show what he can do? of his TOI with a th line center is substantial not sure why you think otherwise. Outside of the beginning of the year and after the TDL he hasnt had any stretch where hes played with one of those centers. There was a large chunk in the middle where he was with Letestu outside of some sporadic line juggling midgame. Essentially most of his time after injury and before the DL was in the bottom  with LanderLetestu.gt Surely his production would be higher. Every single productive player on this roster has had to play with less than ideal lines considering the injuries weve had. Its the laziest possible Yakupov copout Actually if you look at his production when he is with McDavidDraiRNH it has been good. Even with  of his TOI with a C his EVP is still th on the team amongst forwards so top  production. Most of the wingers above him didnt play substantially with Letestu or lander.gt the fact that he has extremely limited usefulness without a  ideal situation for him is more of a negative than a positive.I mean if you stick any other wingers with Letestu Im pretty sure their production would drop too. If you consider an ideal situation to be on a line with other offensive minded players then that applies to any player expected to score.gt I dont think thats true that he has no problem playing on the bottom . If that was true then there wouldnt have been a trade request. And very rarely is he going to get to play with a high skill center playing on the rd and th lines. Not to mention the fact that his effectiveness in that role can be questioned. He is ineffective at best in a checking role which is unfortunate because we have more reliable weapons in our scoring roles. This notion that your rd line is a checking line is dead. If you look around the league they have  scoring lines with a checkingpossession line. Again no one is asking for an elite center he put up points with Gagner and Roy one played in the minors this year and the other isnt even in the league anymore. Theres a lot of wiggle room between Letestu and highly skilled center which you said is rare but the Oilers can actually field if all  C are healthy.gt If hes not scoring points which is rarely he isnt doing much else. You can say that for literally every offensive player. Like I said above when put in position with anyone outside of a C he has put up points.gt And thats why I think its time to cut our losses get our nd rounder and move on. He would be a reclamation project for whoever he goes to nothing more. gt If I keep Yak I would just be doing it to make him available in an expansion draft environment. I think the team is better with someone else occupying his roles. Whos the replacement you have in mind?  You make it sound like other teams are doing you a favour by taking him and freeing up a roster spot. I mean if hes so useless that he cant even contribute on the worst team in the league yet you expect other teams to give up assets roster space and cap for him?

Theyre worth millions of dollars and always in the spotlight especially in cities like Toronto Edmonton Montreal etc. so a lot of their personal lives for better or worse are public. Medical information however is one of the few things they could theoretically control. With minor stuff like a broken bone or sprained knee itd be easy enough to release but with more serious stuff like a staph infection or injuries that may cause long term effects even year end or career ending stuff may be better if left in secret simply to protect the player. People knew Nathan Horton was in pain and not playing but didnt know to what extent until a Players Tribune article was released I believe may not have been PT. But at that point it was him releasing the information not the team.I mean theres two sides to it.

7447332,0,t3_4h9q69,Dubois is the pick at  imo. Hes a better all around player has more size and a better skater.

His linemate was Mitch Marner too.While Dubois did play in an easier league he scored  goals to Tkachuks  while playing with Svechnikov a very good prospect who is not on Marners level.So when it comes to down to it Dubois and Tkachuk might have similar offensive potential but all things being equal I take the guy with more to his game and thats Dubois.

7678158,0,t1_d3ey730,I think Gryba is coming back. Id be really surprised if he wasnt resigned. A  year deal with a slight pay raise would be a good deal. He brings that physicality Chia likes and I think hes a fine bottom pairing guy. Yeah its probably unlikely that those guys are available but I do think it could be good to leave flexibility to see if someone shakes loose because of the threat of expansion. Of course that would mean they would need room to protect them leaving guys like Nurse and Davidson exposed. Im not sure about Joey Legs and how he did. I heard he played well but didnt hear how much he played there. I figure with him its better to have him trying to make it as a puck moving d but if hes more likely to make it as a forward maybe thats a better idea. Yeah Davidson and Oesterle both had some time there and both looked decent on the right side in Edmonton. Davidson actually looked like a natural on both sides his progress from game  til his injury was very nice to see. Nurse will burn a year of his contract either way because hes over  but I think itd still be good for those guys to get that extra seasoning. Injuries will happen eventually and theyll get an opportunity to play. Im actually not a big fan of Clendening. I like his offensive ability even though sometimes it leads to him crossing the blue line and making a pass to a player that isint there but hes not very big and he skates like Gryba. He seems like a guy whos a tweener but hes still pretty young  in October so maybe theres more potential there. ,EdmontonOilers,d3eylwt,1,t5_2rptq

Draisaitl showed he could play against other teams top lines and dropping him down to the third line would essentially put him back in the same situation Yakupov was in. Gotta keep Leon and Hall together. They did well together it was just a cluster fuck trying to find a RW that gelled with them and didnt bring them down as a pair. Your scenario is interesting to play around with though. Losing those contract would clear up  million and added to the  million wed have after expiring contracts wed be able to go big game hunting in free agency.  It would also be easier to try Nuge on the wing and bring in a cheap C. Its possible PC blows up the forward core but I think we can fix things with minor trades and being aggressive during free agency. It would still be a smarter move to play McDavid with a few of our wingers wed like to offload and see if we can bump up that trade value for next years deadline. ,EdmontonOilers,d3h8qc2,3,t5_2rptq

Minnesota for example will likely want to protect  forwards because they must protect assuming they dont waive Parise Koivu Pomminville and theyd want to protect Coyle Niederreiter Grandlund and Haula. On defense they must protect Suter but they also have Spurgeon Brodin Dumba Scandella who would be desirable players meaning two would be exposed. Thats an opportunity for a team like Edmonton they could pay a heavy price and try to pry someone like Brodin plus if they dangled NugentHopkins but the smarter pay is to try to snag someone like Scandella or Dumba without giving up big assets. ,EdmontonOilers,d4c46a2,5,t5_2rptq

Cairns will be a flagbearer in  thanks to his big frame hes foot  already and great skating ability from the back end. His Raiders are in the league final and Cairns is tied for tops among OJHL defensemen with  points through  games.Cairns actually won the title last year as a member of the Toronto Patriots but was traded to Georgetown in the summer a destination he was quite happy with.That was very exciting for me he said. Playing in the OJHL you hear about Georgetown being a premier place to play.The Patriots had an older defense corps so Cairns is counted on much more in Georgetown. That can get him in trouble and scouts think he tries to do too much sometimes but Cairns is aware of that.I get kinda carried away on the rush sometimes he said. I have to learn to stay in my role.Cairns would also like to work on his Dzone coverage but the offensive skills are impossible to ignore which is why scouts are excited to see what hell do next season. He has done all he can in Jr. A and his plan for next season is to join Muskegon in the USHL. After that hes slated to attend Cornell.Ive always been a good student and that has been a big part of my life Cairns said. I wanted to get a worldclass education and play hockey as well.The Big Red will certainly give him that opportunity and by then Cairns will likely be ready to make an impact as a freshman.

8479792,0,t1_d60xlqe,Well he had a draft during his time as director of scouting without getting a single useful player . Multiple drafts of only getting a single player   .Compares fairly well to Stu MacGregor. Actually I take that back. I think Stu did better over the drafts we can actually reasonably critique .Stu had one draft without an apparently useful player  although Im being harder on Stu since Lander is still a regular in the NHL but he got  NHL players out of  and already  so far.Stu got as many NHL regulars from  than Gretzky did from .Eberle Lander Hall Marincin Davidson vs. Turris Boedker Stone OEL Lindberg.Phoenix probably got the better group of players though.If you go into  although Id say its too earlyThe Oilers add Hopkins Klefbom Rieder while Phoenix adds Connor Murphy.Now whats to be expected is a little shakier. I think in order to be considered an average drafting team you should get about . players per standard draft one pick in each round.,EdmontonOilers,d61imko,2,t5_2rptq
8480984,0,t1_d61j43n,gt He doesnt have a proven track record as an NHL head scout until his nonfirst round picks actually make it into the NHL and become successful.Right but his picks so far are doing better than any pick I can remember in the last  years. Youve got to give credit where credit is due.gt Its not simply about whether the move worked out or not its the fact that the Reinhart trade made no sense even at draft night. I think its fair to criticise managementscouting for bad moves if were allowed to bury them into the everyone makes mistakes pile then you can do the same for the past GMs that failed.Im not saying you cant criticize the trade. That is your prerogative as a fan. However that was literally his only mistake so far that we guess so if that trade upsets you so much that you overlook what hes done in the last two drafts and for the Oil Kings then youre wrong. Also if youre going to criticize Green for the trade where he gave up two picks neither of whom have reached or established themselves in the NHL you should also give him credit for the draft picks hes converted into great prospects. You cant have it both ways where you criticize him for giving away draft picks but ignore how hes drafted because it doesnt go on his record till his nonfirst round picks actually make it into the NHL and become successful.,EdmontonOilers,d61o0f1,3,t5_2rptq

Its mind boggling that we have been watching this team be the worst shitshow in sports for  years and yet some are still sitting here going oh boy it sure could have been so much worse!No. It is THE WORST. We have been in the darkest timeline since Hall was drafted. The Oilers are THE WORST.Management is part of it. Hall Nuge and Yak are part of it. They all played a role in being shitty. Somebody needed to lead and nobody did. And no scoring isnt leading we should know this by now. ,EdmontonOilers,d6p8opz,13,t5_2rptq
8698713,0,t1_d6srh4e,gt on one of the most defensively structured teams in the league.This may be true but he played with the worst forwards on that team who were corsi blackholes. It wasnt so much that they were a defensively poor team it was more that they just couldnt keep hold of the puck up front.Also note that Woodguys study is  while Larsson had a big growth season in  under Hynes so Im sure that his numbers from  will show him to be a lot better. In  NJ were th in Team Goals Against per game last season they shot up to th in the entire league.gt And frankly the Griffin Reinhart trade makes me nervous that they might be backing the wrong horse this time around.I dont know why people keep making these faulty comparisons. Chiarelli had almost no input in the Reinhart trade. He went with the information he was supplied and decided to trust his new colleagues.Yeah its possible that Larsson could be a disaster of a defenceman just like it is possible that Hall could be a disaster of a forward in Jersey because quite obviously anything is possible. But everything points to the fact that Larsson is a legit top  if not top  defenceman who was made to play some horrendous minutes matchups with a horrendous group of forwards. Im  certain that he is at the very least as good as Klefbom defensively if not better. He is also very capable of putting up points so on a team like ours he will have more points. I wont be surprised to see him become a  point defenceman on this team in two seasons.At this point having researched him all summer Im pretty confident that he is going to be a very good player for us. The only ones who are still skeptical about him are those who have not yet accepted the trade. We might have lost Hall but weve got McDavid. It really is not the end of the world. I wont be surprised if some people jump on Larssons back if he doesnt turn out with his seasonal best performance on the first day of the season even though that is an absolutely ridiculous expectation to have of anyone let alone a brand new player.,EdmontonOilers,d6syyoo,0,t5_2rptq
8698743,0,t1_d6sz0au,I guess by wilting I mean staying the same. The team was shit and if they stay shit then it will say a lot about the trade.

9745840,0,t1_dae4duo,Im curious does anyone know of a site that takes into consideration whether a shot was made when we have the lead vs when were behind?When were losing a game it seems as though we get into a tendency to throw everything at the net regardless of quality of the shot in the hopes that something will work.  Also our defense will step up more and take bigger risks the more we need a goal to stay in the game leading to more oddman rushes against us.Im not sure if the stat exists out there somewhere but after all those games where we outshoot the opponent and loose Id like to see a stat of shots per minute broken down by when we have the lead when the game is tied and when were behind.  I suspect that when we have the lead our shots per minute average goes down since we have a degree of comfort and can take time to set up a quality chance and when we are losing our shots per minute average goes up since we need a goal and are trying anything to get one regardless of quality of chance.  But I havent run the numbers myself.  And admittedly I havent looked to see if any sites out there track such a stat.,EdmontonOilers,daedy22,1,t5_2rptq

Like Dallas Eakins feeling. I just feel were going to find a way to fuck it up. Dont get me wrong Im jacked we came out with the win but with the injuries that Tampa has and playing a back to back in the west while we had three days rest we shouldve dusted them.

I mean really... There have been games this year where the Oilers  as a team  have been at a level of coordinated play they have not played at for over  games.

But in Edmonton so was everybody else right? He got away with it because everybody else was just as delinquent. Theres a saying that people have applied to the Oilers in the McDavid era A rising tide lifts all boats. Well thats true. More good players should raise everybodys level. But theres another part of it A rising tide submerges all wrecks. Players who have holes take on water. And if they dont get rid of those holes in their game? Thats exactly what were seeing with Pouliot. He cant hide anymore. Eberle and Nuge are going through the same thing. Theyre trying to patch their holes too. The difference with those guys is that theyre not  years old and theyve actually scored consistently. So they get a little more rope.Well see if Pouliot can patch his holes.

Apparently he can be had for a rd round pick or a mediocre prospect. Anyone else think it might be a good chance to take a shot at him if the price is low enough?

10585851,0,t1_dd7t1x8,Over the last two seasons only  separate players have scored  goals with a handful of them doing it in back to back years. Nuge has only scored  one time if you include his junior career and has only been over  twice. He is a playmaker not a goal scorer and there is nothing wrong with that. His shot is good but its not good enough to be a pure goal score at the NHL level. If we are gonna mix things up by taking Drai off of the McDavid line I think there are a few better options to try first especially since Nuge has never played wing in his life. I think its a great thing to have a defensively sound second line center capable of  points a season in todays NHL in Nuge a dynamic and versatile all round player built like a truck in Leon and a generational talent in McDavid capable of stacking up  down the middle if we want it. I dont see a reason to try to completely overhaul the way that Ryan NugentHopkins plays the game.,EdmontonOilers,dd7uky3,1,t5_2rptq

10782259,0,t3_5u8gks,What I noticed from the highlights The Oilers killed Arizona in front of the net this game. What I mean is they were the more physical team around the crease and you could see that on a couple of the goals where they just had better positioning near the net and Arizona couldnt do anything to pick up good defensive positioning. Looks like Draisaitl in specific was able to get into good positions but Im not  sure since I just watched the highlights. Maroon breaking his scoring drought is good for the first line obviously. The passing in this game was pretty good and Draisaitl should have had another goal or at least an assist when the game was  and his shot was blockedsavedOnto the Flyers now hopefully the good momentum carries over before we have to play Chicago and Tampa.,EdmontonOilers,dds40xu,14,t5_2rptq

This place is just ridiculous sometimes.Besides how much I hate the gloom and doom people here who relish every loss I dont know what we should do with Drai. I used to think we should mix up our lines a little but now the the second line has started playing like they should I dont really want to mix that up. Hopefully its just a slump or tiny injury.

11491821,0,t3_6410uo,A couple of thoughts about the Oilers in relation to Calgary.  Im more excited than I should be that the Oilers are guaranteed to finish higher in the standings than the Flames.  Once they clinched a playoff spot this became the most important thing to me.  That god damned  game winning streak they were on a while back really annoyed me..  Im glad that its looking unlikely that well see a BoA in the first round.  Based on the current standings Id say we have a what  chance of facing the Sharks?  That I can deal with.  I have no strong feelings for or against San Jose so that series would be much more enjoyablerelaxing.  If the Sharks win Ill be disappointed for sure but Ill tip my cap and move on.  I know Im in the minority on this  pretty much anyone I talk to is praying for OilersFlames because of how crazy it would surely get but not me.,EdmontonOilers,dfylhsx,15,t5_2rptq
