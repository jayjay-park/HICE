In its infancy the army was trained by Prussian officers and used Prussian equipment and continues to maintain that tradition today. A significant portion of the Chilean population are actually of German descent!EDIT Upon further listening my meagre grasp of Spanish tells me that these are cadets from a Chilean military academy.,monarchism,citrg0x,3,t5_2s6v1

2820320,0,t3_2scjtr,A couple of notes. Germany and the little Entente would have have intervened in case of a Habsburg restoration. They both feared and hated the Habsburgs and their potential to claim Austria and Hungary.. Britain wasnt alone in their war against Germany from .They were allied to the country which had what was supposed to be the best army in the world France. The British counted on the French and their Empire to do a fair share of the fighting. They counted on them and the US and Netherlands to maintain control of French Indochina and the Philipines and Dutch East Indies and thereby secure Singapore and the routes to India and Australia from Japan.In the Mediterranean they counted on the French fleet to help offset the Italians while the British would then be free to operate globally and not have to commit such a large number of ships there. And on the French forces from Tunisia preventing the Italians from concentrating their African forces on Egypt.When Germany attacked Poland the British Empire and France could have invaded the poorly defended German borders and entered the Rhineland effectively ending the war in Poland as Hitler would have had to redeploy almost the entire army to try to breakthrough across the Rhine as I think Napoleon put it the only naturally defensible eastern border for France and hope that the Soviets mop up the Poles without continuing onward into Germany.tldr I blame the French.,monarchism,cnonwaz,4,t5_2s6v1
2962061,0,t3_2u3n4s,What benefits of democracy? Representation? Nah democracy doesnt mean representation just the pretense of it. There are no benefits to democracy except for those who can manipulate it. What we need is nondemocratic minarchy minarchy which could be monarchical but doesnt have to be as long as there are constitutional restraints to stategovernment authority. edit.gt Democracys strength on the other hand is that it ideally draws from the entire populations collective knowledgeDont you mean collective ignorance? gt It also increases the legitimacy of the government since the goal is for the peoples will to be done.Democracy is incapable of achieving its raison detre representing the will of the people. Something of which the existence of is hard to define and conceptually dubious anyway democracy is an impossible ideal that has never been realized. What we get instead is populism and demagogues ignorant and often ideological masses misled by status quo bias the media and so forth into voting for shitty policies that do more damage than good. How the hell is that more legigimate? Legitimacy is just a mirage anyway based on common belief in certain things being legiitmate and other things not being legitimate and is influenced by the status quo.  ,monarchism,co4suiv,3,t5_2s6v1

4088767,0,t1_crlxqrv,The Christiansor the Jews did not invent monarchy it came from Messopotamia where neither of these religions had yet come into existence. And thousands of years after that There were the Japanese Shoguns and the Chinese emperors and the Mongol Khans none of these ruled by the Divine right of Kings or if they did they did not believe that They were neither Christian Muslim or Jew. Their right to the throne in my mind is the fact that they were trained from birth to rule and if they were not they changed the course of history in a way that would allow them to rule such is the case for Genghis Khan. In short they deserve to rule. If your looking for an absolute monarchy that is.,monarchism,crmcem1,2,t5_2s6v1

7988625,0,t1_d4dvbvq,More than likely not as the previous constitution gave a lot of power to the Emperor. If and hopefully when they do restore it they will more than likely adopt a constitution similar to Norway or Spain. Where the Emperor is head of state and commander in chief of the military and has primarily reserve and ceremonial functionspowers. While the Prime Minister or whatever they it will function as head of the government and be in charge of running things just as the PM in the UK does. But in Brazil and in much of South America is wager the Emperor would take a more active role in governing than his European counterparts would. As South America has had a strong tradition of strong national leaders.,monarchism,d4dzxmi,4,t5_2s6v1

10562652,0,t3_5r95ye,gt Do you guys think theism is a requisite for monarchistsNot necessarily. Im reminded of the quote about conservatism I heard a while back that you can be a conservative and not be religious but you cant be a conservative and hate religion. I think its a similar situation with monarchism.As Ive wrote here before I support both monarchy and religion but the two dont really overlap with me.gt the role of atheism in the collapse and fall of many monarchies ingt the world.Are we talking the role of atheism or the role of communism? Because while all communists are atheists not all atheists are communists. I cant recall a monarchy being overthrown for purely atheist reasons nor do I think monarchies overthrown would have survived had the communists somehow been Christian.All is probably too broad since Christian Communism is apparently a thing.,monarchism,dd5e9lm,9,t5_2s6v1

Instead I will say the legitimate monarch would be HIH JeanChristophe The Prince Napoleon.Not only did the French secure our independence and give us a  of our nation they also symbolise our national ideals Liberty Equality and Fraternity! These ideas were cemented in France by the House Bonaparte.Also since they are not the head of any nation we have our own monarchy rather than once again being a dominion of the empire.,monarchism,dfh14e7,2,t5_2s6v1
11658170,0,t1_dghgn6w,I agree with you completely. Even within the states there are great differences in the types of people that inhabit them. I brought up splitting along state lines to make my point easier to put in the post. I have seen several maps of the United States that are split along cultural lines instead of state lines. I think that would be a better way to go about things rather than just split the United States crudely into its respective states.,monarchism,dghgv46,2,t5_2s6v1
