4793496,0,t1_ctypopz,Thanks.  Its a neat idea.  As I understand it its more important to get high CFM at low pressure in mutliple stages.  High pressure air may have the highest power and power densities but its what entails energy innefficiency.   psi air on a  square inch cylinder is lbs of forcetorque.regen and power storage is useful but the primary design consideration should be pressing hard on drive train.  Its also  better suited to velomobiles who have much more air storage room  and relatively long heavy and innefficient chain drive systems.They also go dangerously fast downhill and so can benefit the most of regen because they also need more help going back uphill.,humanpower,ctyrcel,1,t5_37bns
