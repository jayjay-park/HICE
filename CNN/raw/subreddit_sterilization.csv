3902786,0,t1_cr11exg,Thats good advice actually. I didnt have a jock strap and did well without it but recovery would definitely have been even nicer with it  worth it even if youll never use it again. Consider framing it as a memory or so PMuch success and quick recovery for you! ,sterilization,cr15heh,1,t5_33k4w

4555334,0,t3_3dfamx,.Schedule a consult for a tubal ligation. No need to email before. .Be super informed and knowledgable  about the method of tubal ligation you want. .If she says no or is rude say After all my research this is the best option for me. If your personal opinions prevent you from performing then please refer me to another doctor by X date. If she doesnt perform an actual consult because she said no immediately. Refuse to pay and state that you will notify your insurance that a consult wasnt performed and she would be commuting insurance fraud if she submits it. ,sterilization,ct4tjsh,9,t5_33k4w

4641632,0,t1_ctfjkre,There are methods to shut the inappropriate questions down. Several approaches. .Ignore and change the topic.ExampleWhen are you settling down?When I do you will be the first to know. Oh have I told you about what happened yesterday? It was the funniest thing ....Head on but shut down the discussion. When are you settling down?If you mean kids I might never. But as it is my life I hope you respect me enough to allow me to make my own choices and not force your choices for my life on me. I know you just want me happy and believe me  Im very happy. Oh have you heard X ... .If they get very nagging you can stay.I understand you want this for me but instead I would ask you to understand and respect that Im an an adult and this is my choice. You want me to make choices so I am happy correct? Then dont worry. Then..We have already discussed this please respect me enough to drop it. .You must have a fetish about your family members having sex bareback. Im not judging but please stop including me in your sexual fetuses. ,sterilization,ctfn74l,1,t5_33k4w
4774763,0,t3_3g96ug,Ive got this issue as well so when my first appointment hits Im gonna bring it up. What Ive done is have the removal as first choice then have another version as a backup. My backup is the burning method. Having plastic in me just sounds odd to me This may be an option you could look into.. Hope they get back to you..,sterilization,ctwegnl,1,t5_33k4w
5012540,0,t3_3jiffa,There are probably lots of doctors that will listen to you and do it that are not on the list. Each doctor is so different. The important thing is to keep on keeping on  dont give up. Someone WILL do it. You just have to find them. ,sterilization,cuq78f6,1,t5_33k4w
5264508,0,t1_cvke1gq,Looking through all my stuff this is how the timeline went for me August  was the first appointment where I filled out the consent. September  was the day of my preop appointment where they did bloodwork and stuff. So exactly a week before the surgery. September  was the day of the actual surgery. October  today is my postop appointment.And then of course I had my little bladder emergency where I had to go back in to the doctor the day after the surgery but that was an emergency and probably shouldnt count. Of course I also got very lucky and really didnt meet any resistance about being sterilized.,sterilization,cvkll7u,2,t5_33k4w
5409034,0,t3_3p3lhv,The only  guaranteed sterilization method is a hysterectomy but that isnt low risk. A tubal ligation with an ablation comes pretty close though.,sterilization,cw32bud,5,t5_33k4w

6069511,0,t1_cyf3g5c,Aw thanks so much! And like you said for the most part this will be a very uncomplicated procedure and should go pretty smoothly. If you want to get it done you should definitely have it donejust get informed so you can have the best experience possibie. Just as an examplehad I simply knew beforehand that placing an IV can cause a vasovagal reaction I would have taken my time to inform them and made sure I got some anti anxiety meds. Just that simple act might have made a big difference for me! ,sterilization,cyf7a94,1,t5_33k4w
9040223,0,t3_542ebq,Hey! I dont have any advice because mine was bestcase scenario we talked in the other thread but I do wish you good luck in getting what you want!I did find this link  when googling the code listed on my insurance form. Mine was billed as  and my insurance covered it. Im not sure if it was  covered because I met my outofpocket max or because it was considered sterilization. As for adverse effects I still get twinges of pain every once in awhile but Im not sure if its because of the BS or because of endometriosis. But the pain is totally worth being sterilized and never having to worry about babies.Again good luck. I hope you get everything you want and dont have to pay a single penny. ,sterilization,d7yhorw,2,t5_33k4w
