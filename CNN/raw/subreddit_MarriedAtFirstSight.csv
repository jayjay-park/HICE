1943217,0,t1_ckmveqq,Ha ya. Also Vaughn gave him props a couple times too now that I think about it. And I would sure hope so for those psychological screenings lol. Id have to imagine that those online ones are just to weed out candidates and that the four experts go into much more detail offcamera about much more. Ya he was a bit traditional but that is not a crime. People that are overly politically correct calling Vaughn chauvinistic seem ridiculous to me. There are plenty of women that want to fill a traditional role themselves. Courtney is a pretty good example with wanting to take care of Jason. Those people definitely still exist male and female and Vaughn wanted someone on the same page. This should have been a red flag for the experts because to me that sounds like a pretty big dealbreaker for most couples. I think Vaughn and Monet both acted immature at times to each other. Nothing really seemed that extreme other than it being obvious they werent a good match. Him wanting her to cook sometimes or do other things for him seems reasonable for what he wanted. Monet is a very independent woman and obviously wasnt going to be filling such a traditional role so its still kind of astounding they paired the two. ,MarriedAtFirstSight,ckncwso,2,t5_32lsa
3845092,0,t3_34dbes,With Ryan and Jessica I just see a train wreck. She bottles up everything and he walks away during their arguments. I expect them to divorce unless they can pull a complete  with their relationship.Davina and Sean can salvage their relationship in my opinion. He just needs time to adjust because he basically uprooted his life and was put outside of his comfort zone I get that. I understand that hes anxious but rather than run away both of them need to take it one day at a time. Im suprised with Jaclyn and Ryan because in the very first episode she got on my nerves.you signed up for this why would you leave your husband at the altar smh However they are quickly becoming my favorite couple. Shit looks like its gonna hit the fan in the next episode so I want to see how they overcome it. Im glad they are comfortable with each other and can communicate their problems to one another.  ,MarriedAtFirstSight,cqukp0g,3,t5_32lsa

6283998,0,t3_40tg3v, Does the production company pay for the rentals the couples live in? Do they pay for the mortgage or rent of the participants own homes whilst they are on the show? When we see couples divorcing is it a failing of the analysis that matched them or a failing of the couples to make an effort to stay together? Did Neil apply for the show independently or was he approached to apply for the show? How often are cameras filming the couple over the six weeks? How many days per week? How many hours per day? Do the couple plan with the producers what the best things to film are in general fights may not be planned but discussions about important topics or moving belongings into the new home may be etc?,MarriedAtFirstSight,cz3x4cg,1,t5_32lsa
6301581,0,t1_cz5v8zj,Honestly in this situation I dont know. Its different when youre naturally attracted to someone looks or personality and choose to go on these dates versus having an expert see the possibility of an attraction for you and trying to see it yourself. These dates are forced and theres A LOT of pressure and expectations. You cant force attraction but you can try by getting to know them and giving them the chance to gain your trust. That takes time.You dont even know this person when you start dating so the whole process is different than normal its not fair to compare their situations to ours because they are totally different. ,MarriedAtFirstSight,cz5x2r5,2,t5_32lsa

8683323,0,t3_4yvtfc,I dont think thats it.  Hes a bit withdrawn and doesnt seem to find it easy to express emotion.  Perhaps partly because of his apparently rather overwhelming mother.  But regardless Ive noticed that in the interviews he says shes pretty and hes attracted to her and looking forward to being intimate.  Yet when he is actually talking to her he cant or doesnt say those same things.  Thats what has her feeling insecure imo.  She wants someone to say how pretty she is and stuff and he isnt doing it.,MarriedAtFirstSight,d6r1h7l,12,t5_32lsa

9043190,0,t1_d7yu8tk,gt but all official articles inclusive of interviews and so on include payments to the company behind the showI dont believe thats the case as it would completely go against having a free independent media. Ads are what generates revenue for everyone. If a website had to pay MaFS to talk about the show it would mean less of them would talk about the show which would mean less people would know about it less people would watch and they wouldnt be able to charge their advertisers more money. Thats a pretty terrible business model. ,MarriedAtFirstSight,d7yuhpl,0,t5_32lsa
9269539,0,t1_d8qwrlu,Tom and Nick kind of have opposite problems. Tom says all the mean things about Lilly to the camera and Nick says all the nice things about Sonia to the camera.  Yet Tom and Lilly are the ones getting along better on the show. I wonder how Lilly reacts now seeing those comments on TV. I think its funny that Sonia wore such a revealing dress to show Nick what hes missing yet he is wearing a hoodie and tshirt. Why does she even bother? She can do better. Im not sure if their social media accounts can be taken as indicative of their current relationship status. For all we know Sonia could have convinced Nick to hide their being together like she did about their physical relationship. Maybe she wanted a shocking relationship reveal?,MarriedAtFirstSight,d8qzb10,4,t5_32lsa

10707254,0,t1_ddjle8x,Yes a lot of them were superficial and I think that was the producersexperts choice to do that. And because its superficial the participants feel its harder to leave just because of that. Lauren definitely left for superficial reasons and she used her son as an excuse. They obviously did not vet her well and she did not seem stable and ready for a real marriage that is based more on looks! The deal breakers I was concerned about was living in different places and relocating would be an extreme concern cheating wanting someone of a certain ethnicity etc. The stripper thing was certainly a surprise. I would have forgotten to write that down if I filled out an application for this show eyerollI will certainly continue to keep up with this sub but everything Ive read so far hasnt convinced me to watch another full episode. I am unwilling to watch this season because it may cause me to start disliking this whole show as a whole  ,MarriedAtFirstSight,ddkdga6,2,t5_32lsa
11435182,0,t3_62zdjt,I am so team Anthony.. In my opinion Nadia is so flaky that I was also  getting confused. It could be editing but who knows. How did she get from I can only move for love to do you want me to move now? No wonder he ran.. I have a theory that the producers were encouraging her to push him and it backfired.  In America months notice is given by the landlord when the lease is about to expire. How come she only knew after the vow and was willing to move immediately? That lease story seems cooked. Still on my theory... Anthony felt it would be easier for Nadia to move from their last weeks prior to the vow discussion. He felt they would have some time before she relocates. After the vow he moved back home. It was obvious that their communication was lacking during the time apart. Then there was the pressure of relocating that he didnt anticipate. Reservations started growing. During the visit he expressed his fear to Nadia and asked her for more time but she wanted an answer since the alleged lease was expiring. He went practical and examined his unchanging feelings and her feelings  that were not expressed and we never saw until this visit episode and decided to walk away before anyone got hurt. I understand Nadias frustration but I also understand Anthonys POV. If Anthony were a narcissist he would have allowed her move use her for post show fame then dumped her. Maybe if they were in the same state they would have tried dating.  Having someone uproot their live for another person is very daunting so I understand why he was driven by fear and practicality to end the relationship. ,MarriedAtFirstSight,dfs607z,2,t5_32lsa
11776431,0,t1_dguoicu,I feel like if they do another season of this show it will be with the season  people probably Derek and Sonia. Derek definitely wants to do it based on his social media. Sonia said shed consider it. Nick said hed be open to it too but Derek probably has an edgemore sympathetic story what with being dumped so quickly. ,MarriedAtFirstSight,dguw98t,7,t5_32lsa
