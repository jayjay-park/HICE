6830218,0,t3_485cmq,If you liked Mr. Show which is absolutely worth checking out you will love W Bob and David. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross return to their unique brand of screwball sketch comedy with a vengeance. Packed with plenty of humor sometimes offtherails hilarious and sometimes politically charged this is a show that is very easy to watch with only  episodes so far. I think this is some of the best sketch TV around. Even if you dont like sketch comedy too much W Bob and David is worth a try because their type of stream of consciousness comedic flow is unlike any other. There are a few sketches in here that are absolute gold and will never get old and even the weakest sketches had me well entertained. They all blend together beautifully in a way that  creates an amusing journey within each episode. All in all an incredible program that benefits from the crazy minds chemistry and talent of its cast and writers.The show includes some references and nods that will be much funnier if you watch the original program Mr. Show but I have showed it to many friends who have had no knowledge of Mr. Show and have absolutely loved it.A perfect score is hard to earn but Mr. Show is definitely within the top percentile of Netflix originals. The first two episodes take a few minutes to rev up but mostly I just wish there were more to enjoy.,netflixreviews,d0qi7o2,3,t5_37gg3
