1668977,0,t3_2deheg,Possibly a low content definitely not above that. Low content or regular dog. I work in wolfdog rescue and dont like to phenotype such young animals but this one is pretty obvious.,Wolfdogs,cjpjbbe,2,t5_2sv60
4162908,0,t1_crulbr7,Oh yeah her nose is black. Definitely German shephard heritage but she does not look like a malamute at all I wonder why they thought that. Can you show us any pictures of her pup I love puppy pics.,Wolfdogs,crus4m5,1,t5_2sv60
5373287,0,t1_cvyguyu,Yea these looked to be bred intentionally with the fluffier coat. Honestly they are quite stunning. I wish I had more info to share but I wouldnt be soliciting help if I did.  Knowing how this company works it would be nice to know the actual breeder and not use their middleman ring they use.,Wolfdogs,cvyhxqj,1,t5_2sv60
6008045,0,t3_3xrfpl,First off you cant confirm wolf heritage in a puppy you can really only discount it. I could believe hes a low content but only a low content at most. You didnt get a miracle wolf dog. Possibly a low content but Id also more likely believe a GSD crossed with husky or malamute. Definitely mostly dog. Heres whyWolf puppies are born solid colored period. Any markings develop only as the puppy ages. Dog puppies are born with markings. A  week old wolf is solid period. Your dog has white feet pads and nails. Wolves never do even white wolves. Your puppy appears to have blue eyes at an age where wolves do not. No wolf has blue eyes and that trait is only seen in dogs with a strong sleddog influence. Your dogs skull isnt flat enough and the muzzle is already too course pointing to strong GSD influence. Wolves ears are thickly furred and your puppys ear are not. I would bet you have a GSDhusky though maybe malamute. What wolf sanctuary sold you this puppy? That would go against the whole purpose of a sanctuary which are unequivocally not breeders. I think you may have been duped. Also I see youve labeled your video as timber wolf puppy. You do not have a wolf pup. Thats  certain. You dont have a high content animal you are simply ignorant at phenotyping wolves and its very obvious you want your dog to be a wolf up to thinking something special and magical happened with his litter. If you want to know with reasonable certainty what your dog is please consider ordering a DNA test. They are now able to test for wolf content. I think you might be disappointed though. What youve got is mostly a dog if not purely a dog. I see this all the time. People want a wolf dog so darn bad they convince themselves theyve got one even up to telling people its a full wolf. Please dont. You dont have a wolf or high content animal at least not one with wolf in its recent lineage which does make a difference. Since this animal purportedly came from a sanctuary please let us know what the name of the sanctuary is and who the parents are as I would be interested to see the parents who are much more easily phenotyped and to find out what kind of sanctuary would sell wolf dog puppies of any content. ,Wolfdogs,cy76pc2,4,t5_2sv60
6025859,0,t1_cy9htpp,Its called Google. Look it up. Anyone who knows anything about wolfdogs will tell you they need to be bottle fed and raised by their human. ,Wolfdogs,cy9ifhf,-1,t5_2sv60

6805054,0,t1_d0nj0ct,You werent in the wrong at all! and dude dont worry same shit happened to me but I just didnt give a shit. In the end they are OUR puppies and we know more about them than anyone else. I would get it if they were like ..obviously huskies or some shit but when a puppy has wolf content in it they just need to shut up. lt come back me likes you.,Wolfdogs,d0nnbd6,2,t5_2sv60

8487046,0,t3_4vygjf,This is Bruce my two year old Utonagan. We get a lot of comments about him having wolf in him but he is actually a first generation Utonagan. His father was pure Malamute and his mother was GSDCollie. He has a wonderful temperament  not aggressive destructive or dominant. Utonagans were the dogs used in Game of Thrones to play the young Dire Wolves. If you are looking for a dog with a bit of a wolfish look but easier to care for than a wolfdog the Ute could be for you! They still require lots of exercise and mental stimulation and with the Malamute heritage they do shed! A lot! If youre interested please visit rUtonagan to find out more.,Wolfdogs,d62fe01,1,t5_2sv60
