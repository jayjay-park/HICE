To enjoy the scenery you can choose between Red Rock Canyon Charleston Peak Hoover Dam and Valley of Fire. If youre willing to go farther Death Valley is less popular than the eastbound excursions and more stunning to someone looking for pure desert. If youre determined to speed US  probably has the lowest traffic and highest visibility. Its not particularly attractive and wont take you anywhere particularly interesting. Thats why its not crowded so theres your dilemma. I feel like supercars are made to sit in traffic and impress people or to go around a track.  of the ones Ive seen on the road have been in central Los Angeles going the same speed as the Honda in front of them.EditYou asked for food recommendations so if you like fast food here are my favorite chains they dont have in the east InNOut BurgerLampL Hawaiian BarbecueRubios Mexican SeafoodJack in the BoxPinches Tacos,LasVegas,d67nmjc,1,t5_2ra8w
