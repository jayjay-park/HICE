5422910,0,t1_cw3siga,This is the face of a man who has had  years of tools that allow him to make completely custom Halo content at will and has a healthily skeptic mindset that allows him to not get hyped about things that havent happened yet.,halospv3,cw4u0dp,0,t5_3a0t7

8073986,0,t1_d4nk8si,nah this was like just after leaving the bridge got stuck by a grunt right on the magnum ammo spawn at the same time it gave me the checkpoint. reverting was instant death wich eventually just stopped respawning me all together.but i guess iwas just unlucky but i thought ill let you know anywayother than that POA ran fine for me.the lfashing didnt happen in POA just Halo right at the start after picking up sprint ability and then the enemies come with the dropship. whenever i or my allies shoot the enemies my screen flashes red with the red areas as if i was getting shot and take damage but the thing is that im not taking damage. same happens when i progress and shoot the banshees and its almost flat red screen when i get to the marine area as theyre shooting the dropships,halospv3,d4nlbns,1,t5_3a0t7

8077326,0,t3_4ptgf0,SPV is what it says on the tin.But of course I wont just leave it at that. Ive played SPV and SPV over the years and was a part of the halomaps forums I do sorely miss the MAK but thats for another discussion.This review is straight off a straight play through from PoA to AoTC on Heroic.If SPVs goal was to revamp and remix Combat Evolveds gameplay and level design to modern standards while still falling within the range where it feels like it was always a part of CE then yes CMTs succeeded. I played the first Halo again to the extent of this first release has allowed me and I had fun because of its own merits while also intermingling with several modern standards most namely the ability to choose a starting loadout and combat flow. Its fast and hard not to discredit the original but moreso in this regard because the enemy difficulty.There were several encounters which I had to raise my eyebrow at over a combination of minor issues that I couldnt discredit on their own individually save for weapon balancing most namely the dark room engagement during PoA which ends with two Hunters breaking into the room and the initial breaching of the Command Deck on the Truth and Reconciliation. On your own in each of these encounters and I can imagine in many more sprinkled through the levels you get overhwelmed very quickly regardless of anything you can do short of power weapons. Not to say you can fight out of it and perhaps that was the intent of some of these engagements but its the little things like Isolating a Red Elite and magdumping an AR into them which only results in shield breaking that piques my annoyance in well planned moves and manuevers that should have payout only to come up short because the player overestimating what the AR can do a flinch from the focus or beam rifle especially prevalent during Truth and Reconciliations plateau section or getting fucked by the special Plasma Pistol variant.Its not a constant thing that happens this frustration but it flares up sometimes in what I can only call a difficulty spike which Im sure is something that is allowed but Im just gonna voice anyway. Its not something I encountered in any other of the Halos.Audio mixing regarding custom dialogue and music is also a note dialogue is often too quiet and the music is too loud this seen especially during the PoA intro.All this to only list my only upfront complaints about SPV. I found myself really only using VISR or Health not really bothering to switch out any armor abilities running an AR usually. MS should have its spread tightened I feel as well. Never used the Gungoose too actually.I did enjoy the fact that the Assault on the Control Room was an actual Assault as well as the extra encounters on Halo and the Gravity grenade was a very useful implement.,halospv3,d4nytk2,4,t5_3a0t7
8085389,0,t1_d4ncx9r,I like doing this at the beginning of Crows Nest in Halo  since the marines arent invincible but its still really hard.,halospv3,d4ove0m,2,t5_3a0t7

9606334,0,t1_d9wk7oo,Yes but the part  sneak peak said it was putting Prometheans into the game and since Prometheans use forerunner weaponry it would make sense to have them be modified by  Guilty Spark. Do you agree or am I way off?,halospv3,d9x6e4p,1,t5_3a0t7
