982619,0,t3_25c3v9,Just because Hank is loosely based on Charles Bukowski doesnt diminish Charles at all.  Without this article I would have had no idea Hank was based on anyone.  Also the author being critical of Hanks musical taste is plain stupid.  It makes sense for Hank to like the music of his generation just like Charles like the popular music of his generation.,californication,chfzct3,3,t5_2rdht

1194964,0,t3_27rwgs,The ending will either be  Hank and Karen finally get together or  They do not end up together. This was the first decision made before writing started this season. Once that was decided they wrote the other episodes literally as filler. It obvious that they get together at the end  given Karens accident... I hear wedding bells... ,californication,ci41vwx,2,t5_2rdht

1342488,0,t1_cikj1rp,I definitely feel like it was a good ending. I mean it wasnt really in tune with the rest of the season but it did work out. Hank ends up happy. Karen ends up happy. Julia ends up with someone that can probably make her happy. Levon learns that theres at least one woman that will pay attention to him without him paying her first. All in all I think it was a good end. ,californication,cikn8xf,7,t5_2rdht

1360730,0,t3_29ky11,Youre not alone at all...some people want more than others. I for one have always loved the show for what it is to me which felt like real humor with witty dialog by characters that are memorable. The story line wasnt about the situations he was put in or found but the real struggle of what you want and what you get and the never ending chase of those two realities and that shit can sometimes be fucked up no mater what you do or dont. He never lost sight of what he wanted no mater how many times he fucked up Just kept at it until the wheels fall off if you will. You cant always get what you want.But if you try sometimes well you might find you get what you needFor me Rocket Man and You Cant Always Get What You Want are the two songs that encompass the entire show as a whole   ,californication,cimuvgh,2,t5_2rdht

2609522,0,t3_2pivah,Levon and the entire seventh season was a drag for me. I just finished watching yesterday actually. I think Season  would have been the best place to stop. I never felt like Hank deserved the perfect ending and thought him leaving on that tour bus with Faith having reconciled with Becca was the best place to end.The seventh season was a season out of fresh ideas or fresh laughs. The first four seasons were incredibly addictive. I found a bit of dip in the fifth but enjoyed the sixth. The seventh was akin to a slow death though the final episodes were decent but never to the quality of earlier seasons.,californication,cmz7acf,3,t5_2rdht
2755074,0,t1_cnh7jnw,Hahaha its good to see its still getting new viewers.  I also love that most of them post about hating   and  disliking Becca etc. like theyre the first ones to feel that way.  Either way good financially for the show and its producers.  ,californication,cnh8nna,1,t5_2rdht
2950130,0,t1_co3fmha,Also Showtime has a hard time letter shows go. I remember an interview Ill try to find it where Kapinos said he couldnt imagine the show going more than  years this was after season  when they got a season  renewal because of its limited premise then he added on Ill run the show into the ground if they let me which he did. Showtime renews shows way passed their expiration date and ignores fantastic series finale type endings because they care more about the ratings than the show makes sense I guess but nurse jackie weeds Dexter Californication all passed their natural end and Im worried Shameless may be heading that way.,californication,co3fz6b,2,t5_2rdht
