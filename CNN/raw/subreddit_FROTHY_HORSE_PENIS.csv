3097314,0,t3_2vmnum,Better Know a Matchup! Week   Fox and Falco!Better Know a Matchup is a series that helps new players learn about little tricks with every character in the game. I will be covering Project M a mod of Brawl. Each character will have his or her own week where I make at least five posts about five techniques relating to the character. Although I cant keep a perfect schedule I should be posting nearly every week day and any planned breaks or updates about how much time I have to continue this series will be mentioned.The Multishine is a situational technique that Fox and Falco can do. Although Wolf can perform this as well he is not including in this week. The explanation and captions are found in the imgur album please look at that for specifics!A basic rundown of how multishining works is that Fox and Falco can jump cancel their Reflectors or shines on the th frame after the attack was executed. After inputting a jump there are a few frames of an animation that looks very similar to a crouch often times known as jumpsquat. Fox has a  frame delay before he is able to input a shine while midair while Falco has a  frame delay. While midair Fox and Falco slowly drop back to the ground. After landing they can jump again and once their period of jumpsquat is over shine. This can be repeated over and over again and in real time will look like shining multiple times in a short amount of time without leaving the ground.Multishining is a mostly useless technique when done for prolonged periods of time but can be very useful to use once in a while. Mixing in aerials with doubleshines or even triple shines instead of just regular shines can end up helping you trim down your opponents shield a bit faster but multishining for too long is risky and will probably just end up with you getting punished. Changes in timing can also end up with your opponent getting hit with a shine which can lead into a combo.As Fox a small multishine when your opponent is near the ledge can sometimes aid in shine spiking them. Falco cannot do this as his shine sends opponents upwards.Its important to note that the uses of this technique only work well in certain situations. Multishining is mainly a flashy option and other easier options will normally work just as well if not better.Index of all Better Know a Matchup postsIf youd like to request a specific gfycat please message me!
