5484171,0,t3_3ot19x,Unfortunately this is no easy task. Ive given it a lot of thought in the past and realize that there is no easy way. The most efficient way to get users is probably to repost in rInternetIsBeautiful but Ive already posted chatnon so I cant do it again.One possible solution would be to program a new channel with exciting properties similar to textspeech and maybe post that specific channel on internetisbeautiful. So maybe we can come with ideas for a new channel? Maybe it could be a simple game or something else that would integrate well with chat.Im very busy with school currently but when winter break swings by Ill have time to work a little more on Chatnon again.
