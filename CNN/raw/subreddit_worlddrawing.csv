4774560,0,t3_3ga3rp,Sure! I need my main hero at the moment drawn.Male archanist age . Dirty blonde hair to his shoulders after months stranded at sea. Dark tan skin hazel eyes. A scene of him washed up on a marshy shore would be great. He is mostly human save some odd features like ridged earlobes and small black shards protruding from his body at various symmetrical points. He washes up in a torn white tunic and woven pants down a bit below his knees. He is gripping a sack with food strange mystical objects and a staff attached. Thanks!,worlddrawing,ctwdjj1,2,t5_39h08
