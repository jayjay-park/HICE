LO did dada dog and uh oh at that point so he got the thumbsup.One thing to consider is receptive language. If you can say things to your kid and they obviously understand then thats a good sign!  Do you want your cup? or More crackers? or What do you see over there? with an appropriate reaction are all good signs that the toddler brain is growing appropriately.,toddlers,dg4yxzd,1,t5_2ta5v

You want your kids to eat them to get the nutrition now for their growing bodies not because in  years they will look at broccoli and not know what to do. Put some in smoothies make purees and put them in those pouches or buy some already made then start experimenting. Dont make it a thing but give him some beans then next time maybe some corn or peas or edamame or carrots for a snack or whatever. Figure out what he does like preferences can change hourly with kids and dont stress when he doesnt want to eat them. ,toddlers,dgcptzb,1,t5_2ta5v

She was no longer eating just comfort nursing and eating tons of food during the day and drinking water. You didnt say how old your kid is but if she is toddler aged you should definitely expect solid foods to replace daytime feedings! ,toddlers,dgde128,2,t5_2ta5v

My  month old just went through a  day stretch of not wanting to sleep alone even though hes been sleeping alone in his room since he was like  months old and sleeping through the night for months now. He is cutting  teeth at once I didnt think it was that many but our pediatric looked and confirmed it so that could be it. Hes also talking up a storm so maybe his brain wont shut off. Long story short...Im convinced that when it comes to sleep issues its always a phase because almost everything is a phase at this age. I hope you and your little one get some rest soon.,toddlers,dgkhwdx,2,t5_2ta5v
