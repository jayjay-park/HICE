4519285,0,t3_3ctso4,Hi I am currently going into grade  at a school in ontario. I am interested in the engineering physics program at UBC. I was just wondering if you could give me some information on what current engineering physics students think of the program and if they have done any coop placements yet. Also any information you have on campus life and what it is like to live in Vancouver would be very helpful!! thanks so much,ubcengineering,ct0arm9,1,t5_31d77
