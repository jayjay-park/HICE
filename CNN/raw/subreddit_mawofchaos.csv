I was brought to a party there by someone who saved me when I was lost in the desert. But the host that was Bezumius lost his mind and held all the guests captive.,mawofchaos,d5h76qx,3,t5_35yc6
8560123,0,t1_d6bkzxj,I had a nightmare Null. The Trickster was in it taunting me and well... thats why Im a bit worked up.     We should also go to the Beach sometime too. Ive asked ZaneuResidentno  to train me in combat. I think I need to integrate mental and physical skills if Im going to stave off the Trickster...    Do you have a little something to eat and drink? Im hungry. And I dont think learning on an empty stomach is a good idea.,mawofchaos,d6blc2l,3,t5_35yc6
