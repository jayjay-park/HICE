2596972,0,t3_2p05ow, The reassurance of secure payment didnt become clear until I viewed the item I added to basket. Id like to see some indication of secure payment much earlier in the coversion process. Consider adding them into your header and near the add to basket section on your product pages. Your view basket button is tiny and once Ive added to basket that button becomes your primary call to action. Why should it be so small and the same colour as every other button in that row? Arguably the link pops up to view the basket once youve added an item but that disappears fairly quickly and not everyone will be ready to head straight to the basket at this point. The  gold stars below reviews by YOT PO are hollow indicating the item has no stars. Im not sure if this is carried through by some kind of widget Im a UK CRO consultant so Ive never heard or YOT PO presumably its a US review platform. Id either fill the stars in and move them above the fold or lose em.Hope this helps mate let me know how you get on.,webmarketing,cmxk7js,2,t5_2qn3q

3079904,0,t1_coh7rb9,Awesome thanks. Can I ask what your website is? Id like to check it out.The pricing seems so arbitrary to me right now that Im afraid to make any set ad costs that we might later find are too high or low.,webmarketing,coh8a9r,1,t5_2qn3q
3098063,0,t1_coizlp4,Im sorry but thats not at all what Im asking. I know how to schedule posts. The issue is what time to schedule them at. As I stated most advice Ive read boils down to posting when fans are most active. Okay. If you see the linked pic youd notice that the graph is highest at night but declines rapidly thereafter. On the otherhand its lower in the morning but by and large the graph is increasing from morning till night. So even if I post in the morn I might have a lower number of fans in that particular time period when i post but the sum of my active fans over the next couple of hours is going to be higher. This with these two parameters in mind when should I post? Has somebody figured this out? Is it just trial and error? And so on. ,webmarketing,coj42xa,0,t5_2qn3q

Approach audience and say you solved the problem. Profit RepeatForget money and profit for the first year or two AT LEAST. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT QUIT YOUR DAY JOB!
