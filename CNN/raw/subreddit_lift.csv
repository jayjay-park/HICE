1838373,0,t3_2fmk5j,Ive been doing a hybrid sort of strengthbb program and doing  to  sets of  to  reps between  and  of max depending on how Im feeling on the day. About a month of that and I got a new squat pr the other night pretty easy. Think I could have added another lbs and still gotten it. And my legs have hardened up. So I think if youre  smart about how you do it and make sure to get enough rest and recovery it can work well. ,lift,ckapxuy,1,t5_2qjhv
