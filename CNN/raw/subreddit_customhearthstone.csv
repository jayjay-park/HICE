Its hard to evaluate this card given its uniqueness but I think this is a pretty devastating cards against a decent amount of decks. It easily has the potential to burn  cards and I personally think it would be better if it only forced the opponent to draw  cards.Bank Investment. Its a little weird given its wording but I assume it works the same way as wild growth? If so it would prob be better if it said At the start of your next turn gain a mana crystal.Air Strike. Past turn  this is a pretty insane card and certainly needs a mana increase of at least  or . On turn  you have a consecration for  mana or on turn  a flamestrike.Kezan Vaults. Im not too sure if the Vaults have some special ability but right now this is a overcosted mirror imageEquip Shredder. Given that Mark of Nature costs  for a similar effect I think this card could be brought down to  mana.Upgrade! Balance is fine for this card I just want to let you know it has the same name as an existing warrior spell.Demolition Squad. Its not strictly broken but this is a card that I would be very wary of. It does the same job as prenerf leeroy except its harder to combo with in this class but you also get access to  copies of it in your deck.Steamwheedle Thug.

2365906,0,t1_cm44rpn,Thanks! I put it at  mana to ensure playing it on curve wouldnt be helpful. You cant play him on T with any overload and get minimal value if you play him on T after having again broken curve by using Lightning Bolt on T along with playing a  cost minion. Thus the turn where you begin getting real value from him is around  a turn where youll often see Shamans having been forced to use their first Lightning Storm or try to stem the tide of an aggro deck like Zoo or Hunter by using Feral Spirits. Then youll play him and hopefully clear the aggros board balanced by the fact that your overloaded crystals wont really let you pop the deathrattles and so totally clear the board. ,customhearthstone,cm44vlp,2,t5_30mve

2650830,0,t3_2qb2st,I actually think the lack of these is one of the great things about Hearthstones design.  Most card games have something like this Enchantments in Magic but because they bypass the primary way you interact in the game minions every interaction with them is less rich than it would be if it was attached to a minion.  Imagine the card text it would take to make a minion work the way it does in HS by hand. All of that is basically free interactions that you dont have to pay for with the main currency of card design text.I occasionally see attack minions attack weapons and the like to get around this but I think those can almost always be more interesting on a normal minion.  Steamwheedle Sniper is a great recent example of something thats more interesting because it can be killed in normal ways.I think your Rally Thick Skin and Continuity examples would all be excellent ideas though its just that theyd be more interesting as abilities on minions with relatively normal stats.,customhearthstone,cn4leva,8,t5_30mve

3181229,0,t1_cormsez,Blood Pact I knew I was wording it wrong just couldnt figure out how. Thanks.Soul Stone I see this as sort of a combination between Ice Block and Ice Barrier that takes the worse parts of both. It can only trigger when youre about to die like Ice Barrier but it gives you flat health when it goes off instead of a full invulnerability like Ice Block. Depending on how far ahead your opponent is it might not even buy you an extra turn. I can see where  health might be a bit much though I was struggling to find a middle ground thats not too strong while also not being a useless amount.Banish Im not too concerned with making a new mechanic since a it could be worked into other warlock or shaman cards and b its all just for fun anyway but the Freezing Trap comparison is valid. Originally I was trying to work out an idea based on the warlock spell Howl of Terror in WoW having it be something like fear all enemy minions but I couldnt really figure out a way to make fear different from freeze so it ended up turning into this.,customhearthstone,corqeze,2,t5_30mve

But looking at it that way this card just doesnt have as much potential or usefulness.,customhearthstone,cpi2a56,1,t5_30mve

3451572,0,t3_2zrkm4,I wasnt going to comment but since youre planning on making your own card game based on Hearthstone I figured I might as well leave some feedback.  On a side note there are some crazy detailed guides on this subreddits wiki in the Resources section.Gwyn Lord of Cinder Shouldnt bold all because its not a keyword and should also probably specify all other characters because it could be interpreted that this minion destroys itself upon being played which I doubt is the case.  Pretty good overall but I dont think it really has that much of a negative effect. Its a  for  which is good but not great because of mana warp. The effect could be used to remove your own hollow minions if youre playing a deck with them but I doubt youll have a very full board by turn  anyway. Not sure how fitting this is for warrior considering it heals all characters ala Tree of Life. Im not sure what I would change about this if it was a class card for the emerald herald hero you made then that would probably be a lot more fitting.The Four Kings Pretty standard and yet cool enough to be fitting of its rarity.Knight Artorias Attack should be capitalized. I dont know why its just that stats like Mana Attack and Health are always capitalized on the cards. It should also read if you control Sif give him  Attack that way it makes it clear that Sif needs to be on the board. I think he needs more of a drawback though.Royal Sorcerer Navlaan The human tag is probably unnecessary unless you want to apply that to  of the other cards in Hearthstone. Very solid card nonetheless if your opponent just kills the  another will spawn and if they just kill the  youre left with a .  Its like a  but it really isnt and you can avoid having to divert  damage to this card by just silencing it and killing the .  Very nice although you should specify that the Invader Navlaans summoned are ranged.Invader Navlaan Really cool keyword. Not much to say here for a token.Smelter Demon Needs more collateral perhaps about  or  because its not really comparable to Fel Reaver otherwise. I like the keyword though.Creighton the Wanderer Should probably state his full name Mild Mannered Pate. It also needs a drawback that doesnt rely on your opponent having Pate.Mild Mannered Pate Again should probably state Creightons full name for clarification purposes. Also needs a drawback even more so than Creighton.Chaos Witch Quelaag Its King Krush but its a Demon and its neutral.  Firstly demons shouldnt be neutral most of the time so that theyre more of a unique trait to the warlock class and secondly it should be worse than King Krush because its not a class card. It could work as a cheaper less efficient King Krush but otherwise there really isnt much room here for change.Smough Same as before needs to specify the full name. It also needs a drawback.Dragonslayer Ornstein Needs a drawback.Emerald Herald You didnt specify a hero power andor the type of class cards to go along with this so Im not really sure what this is supposed to be. Nice art though.It may look negative but a lot of these cards are really good. I noticed one thing though that really prevented these from being overthetop perfect which is that most of these cards lack a drawback.  They have slightly above average statlines  for   for  and a lot of card text but that text is for the most part situational and doesnt really have any sort of drawback. Many of these cards have very specific interactions with each other that wont be seen most of the time and are otherwise strictly better than their nonlegendary counterparts. As a rule legendary cards may have extra value but that value cannot be put into raw stats. This means that you cant have a  for  legendary minion with no card text but you can have a  for  legendary minion with a small bonus effect.The keywords some of these cards have dont really feel like theyll be used enough to warrant having a keyword but assuming an entire expansion was made around the Dark Souls theme that wouldnt really matter anyway.Theyre lovely cards overall and I wish you luck in your carddesign endeavors. Again check out the wiki for this subreddit there are a lot of really useful sources there that helped me a lot with card design. Some of it deals with raw numbers and balance while some deals with ethics but overall its extremely helpful.,customhearthstone,cplpfg1,2,t5_30mve

Albeit they are easy to destroy by focusing the dualblademaster but if left untouched can perhaps swing the game around with buff cards that complement it savage roar bloodlust blessing of kings cult master.It may be a very hard to fill niche in both constructed and arena but can offer some big rewards for this gamble.,customhearthstone,cq6ngri,1,t5_30mve
3642031,0,t1_cq7ende,Heres my biggest issue with the card from a design perspective and it is because of this that it makes it difficult for me to accept the concept of this card.The main issue for me is that the card is called Hostage. It doesnt make sense to me from a flavour perspective. It would make sense if I take an opponents minion as hostage and he had to ransom it back so I get coins. However with its current design I am murdering my own minion and I somehow get coins. So did I kill him to take his money? If it was ransom money who paid? Also why did he pay if I already killed the hostage?One solution is to change the mechanics to actually fit the idea of a hostage or change the flavour of the card to match the mechanics. I would personally lean towards the former solution.,customhearthstone,cq7f3cp,1,t5_30mve

4283382,0,t3_3a11th, cards eh? Well here we go.Raised Warlock Interesting stat allocation. Im pretty sure this wouldnt be used much because of that. If I remember correctly its the same stats as Hemet. Then again it will still be used more then Hemet because Spell power is actually somewhat usefulGhosts of Lordaeron As someone who actually hasnt played WoW logic behind cards doesnt matter to me much but damn this is a cool idea.Undead Tailor I could see this being played if it was  cost. I dont think this effect is worth no attack for  mana.Mad Monk I assume you mean restore health to your hero?  Im not sure  health and  mana of stats is worth a lost minion for you and I think if you can use this on your opponents Undead then that is broken. Addled Alchemist Do Mechs count as living? Still nice design on a beefier version of Fel Cannon.Forsaken General I really like this card. Id be interested to see how having Taunt will affect this effect.Scarlet Menace Ive been seeing this effect in a few places recently. Personally I like this idea but I dont think many others would considering how they dislike being able to bypass Taunt and Stealth. which I do sort of get for those last to but I dont mind a card that breaks Divine Shields so Idea based off a card I designed a while back drop its attack by  and have it deal  damage to any character it attacks first.Lights Hope Read what I wrote about Mad Monk. Although this ones slightly better as you dont get good stats for its effect when you kill your opponents.Putriss  Is the Undead tag going on any current cards? And does living characters include Heroes. Its OK from my stand point. Not useless but not spectacular.Priestess of Lordaeron Uh... I dont get the last part. Return an Undead minion to your hand that parts good if situational. But resetting Battlecry? Doesnt adding a card to you hand already reset its Battlecry for when you play it again?Scourge Priest Make it restore  health to give it an edge over Earthen Ring Farseer.Scarlet Stalker See Scarlet Menace entry. Still want to reiterate that personally I like this concept. Im just thinking about what other people might say.Ghastly Knight Youve made Goldshire Footman an Undead. I bet thats actually happened at some point in WOW.Grave Riser If an Undead Dragon is called a Frost Wyrm what is a Undead Jungle Panther called?Bane of the Living Firstly give the Broken Bones a mana cost.   doesnt matter. Just make sure it has one. Secondly you used the word cursed in Ghosts of Lordaeran as well and its a meaningless keyword. You can just say Give any minion this minion attacks Deathrattle Summon a  Broken Bones for your opponent. And as for the effect I think its a good if a little on the strong side. Isnt it just Noths Hero Power placed in a card?Undead Horde Simple. Effective. Possibly a little low costed for its effect. Nice.Crypt Spinner I understand what you are going for but i think it would be easier to just be  Battlecry Freeze a minion.  I just think your idea might be a little too complex.Restless Squire Okay design but Im not sure how effective the Enrage will be on a  health minion. Unless it goes the Angry Chicken route.Recently Risen Very intriguing design. I think this might see quite a bit of play.Battered Warrior I dont really see the point of this card. It dies after  turns but doesnt have much of an upside. You need to make it have stronger than average stats say a  or something so you can use it as a large tempo swing for a short time. I see your logic behind it but that logic also works better for cards that are actually a threat. Case here you drop a  for  mana that is going to die your opponent doesnt really need to go to much effort to kill it. But drop a   turns early and now your opponent has to decide whether to wait for it to die or destroy it now to protect what is coming next. It just seems more logical that way.Scarlet Scourge See point already made twice so far.Shadefright Simple and effective.Shatter Firstly this is the name of a spell card. Okay its not actually but it sounds like it should be Secondly read rant about Battered Warrior again. This effect is of no use on a weak health minion.Animated Armor Is  mana over Mad Monk just worth  health and Taunt? Just dont see why you would run this over Senjin.Stalwart Protector I swear Ive heard this card name somewhere before. Other then that its  taunt for . Not much else to say. Actually there is a slight point. While this doesnt bother me so much look at this article specifically the third point under Ruby Dragon. Its harsh and kind of demoralising but he does sort of have a point.Frail Fiend I dont think this ability is suited for a  cost minion because unlike midlate game cards there arent that many efficient removal early game to counter a swing like this. Compare to Zombie Chow. At least there is the unwritten caveat that attacking face is relatively useless. Here its just  damage for  mana.Walker I think  mana is about the time when you can start to use this effect as this is when the more beefier cards come out. Make it a  and youve got something here.Departed Soul A Drain Life if situational on a decent body? Possibly too strong for  mana. Maybe ?Grave Robber So Dr. Boom but actually balanced? START TAKING NOTES BLIZZARD!Death Charger I double checked and you actually didnt copy a card name. The Deathcharger in the Naxxramus fights doesnt have a space between the words. I actually had a debate a little while ago about how you could use Reckless Rocketeer as a template for charge at  cost for . It was pointed out that not many people use Rocketeer but maybe you stick an Undead on it and it might be worth something. On that point though Im more than half way through this list and aside form the Broken Bones cards and the Restore Health mechanic that you claim is meant to use them and which I still think is awful by the way there arent that many cards that actually synergise with the Undead tag. Ill give you a pass this time because Demons didnt have much internal synergy when they came out they still dont have much but its better now but just keep that in mind.Necromancer Still using the term curse I see. Well of coarse you are this isnt constantly updated by my opinions. That said I like that you have a targeted Redemption Spell and its actually pretty balanced for stats. Well done.Im getting close to  characters now so To Be Concluded in Part ...,customhearthstone,cs8gg7t,1,t5_30mve

4301093,0,t3_3a89qf,great feelings about the card.the damage itself may need to be dropped to  as it gives indefinite board clear. but it may be fine due to how the mana cost belays it. until after lt hp minons lose relvance. it is positioned as a drawn out alternative to flamestrike but the minons of the opposition also dont lose board control or act of damaging when removed so the curve improvement also could quite reasonably be under powered. and that makes it even more exciting. i love how you said killed by hero thus including spell damage. it is a more interesting cardtext and actually something so themantic i hope an expansion centers around it. with introduction of cards focusing on the role of the hero spells and weapons and mana and draw and leader cards which focus on traps and minions changing heros circumstance,customhearthstone,csaghk0,2,t5_30mve

4363608,0,t1_cshfdfp,Well maybe youre right since I went with a very conservative version but Id like to give you some counterpoints nonetheless.The biggest downfall of the Volcanic drake is its low likelyhood of actually attacking due to low survivability but the stealth should take care of that so in a way the stats are better.Furthermore I would argue that in the right deck a cost reduction is not that hard to achieve. A good vanish makes her cost  or makes her completely free something that is a lot harder to pull off with the drake.In general she was meant to work similar to Edwin. Combo a bunch of cards together and boom suddenly a minion that looks very scary only this time in mill rogue.

Megaclumsy is actually better than Clumsy in most cases because the effect is more predictable you know hes going to miss. Should be a  or  not .EDIT It actually hits a random character not just enemies. In that case stat distribution is fine. Fearsome GronnDecent enough but Dire Wolf Alpha is probably still the better buff card cause youll need at least  other ogres to make this give more attack than direwolf. Gronn TyrantThis one is nice. Sacrifice one point of attack to give ogres more health. Could be a bit too strong but it looks good. Gronn SubjugatorLike the idea. Stats are balanced and the effect is good. Ogre WarmaulLike this. Gives it another benefit and works with ogre synergy. As is it was a very mediocre card. Dreadmaul AmbusherInsane. Super sticky if you get one inspire off. Either nerf the stats or make it summon different minions with the same stats if you want so that it doesnt just win you the game if they cant answer two of them immediately. Ogre GladiatorGood card not sure if its too strong. On the one hand youre getting  health which is pretty tough to deal with in exchange for clumsy but it also has an additional upside of gaining armour even if you miss. I would nerf the stats a bit maybe . Stonemaul MagiFine. Not as easy to pull off as Thunderbluff but its got much better stats. Ogre WarlordCrazy potential value but costs a lot and requires you to have a board of ogres already. I think its fine the buff could maybe be reduced to only  attack but its still balanced imo with .Imperator MarGokPretty bad.  mana  is bad the effect isnt going to be useful against most decks would not run even with ogre synergy. ChoGallIf the effect lets spells hit your own board or face then this card is horrible. No one would consider spell damage  worth if your spells could hit your own face. This also screws up buff cards like demonfire and demonheart cause they could misfire and hit something else. It should only affect spells that deal damage and only allow you to redirect them to different enemies or else this card is just horrible. ,customhearthstone,custtrg,3,t5_30mve
5037677,0,t1_cut3o06,If this was a Rogue card I would probably increase the cost significantly because part of their theme is buffing weapons.A change like that doesnt really follow any known exceptions or formulas but in this case I could justify it with common sense.

5089045,0,t3_3kpr4o,I mention it in the album but the general goal of this set is to make cards that are borderline OP in arena while simultaneously not impacting constructed.  That is  these cards should be strong individual cards that dont really fit any constructed archetypes for their various classes.According to this post from a week ago these four classes are performing noticeably worse in arena than their counterparts I believe this is a problem that is solvable by introducing new overpowered cards Paladin got a large boost in GVG thanks to both Muster for Battle and Shielded Minibot if other classes got similar power cards they may be able to catch up.  Because these are targeted for Arena theyre all Commons though the effects on a few of them warrant rare normally that would defeat the purpose of making a stronger Arena class.Among the set I think the Hunter and Warlock cards are the most interesting to talk about.Let me know what you think and Ill probably update it later on.  I play a lot of Arena and have my own ideas about what would help various classes but Im aware that I basically only play Arena as a tempo game and that its reasonably viable to go for Control or hard aggro in Arena as well sometimes.  You may have some Arena perspective I dont have so please share your opinions and comments.  Thanks!,customhearthstone,cuzf7r4,1,t5_30mve
5092823,0,t3_3kq9fs, Transforming a minion into a  Treant should cost  mana alone. gt Please Polymorph Boar is a whole other story as it can be abused on your own minions. Dont you see that this is a much worse Hex? Summoning   Treants costs about  mana alone. Choose One effects should both have about the same value. I would suggest keeping the first effect the same but make the second summon  Treants which cost about  mana reducing the cost of the whole card to . ,customhearthstone,cuzvk79,0,t5_30mve
5092993,0,t3_3kq9fs,This is another one of those cards where people make invalid arguments by adding stats together and everyone goes wild.Theres something thats difficult to understand about cards that summon multiple minions so it might be confusing at first but its currently the most accurate way to judge cards like these. So hold on.Ill only talk about the second option. The card costs  so  it has  points. Its a chooseone effect which usually but not always means about . of those points is taken up. Were left with . points.The second effect summons  s. Its tempting to think of those collectively as a  but theyre not. Its difficult to explain but basically the  in the vanilla test is only there because all minions start out as s. This is because a minion with  health is absolutely useless above all else and unless its supported by another card it will not function as a normal minion. Really minions start out as s and then they gain bonus value equal to their mana cost times two. This is important because it means that the card itself Mark of the Forest is not summoning three  minions. Its actually summoning three  minions that each have . What this means is that the cards are judged as s instead of s and when you add them together  you get .Because of this the second option is actually underpowered. Its summoning  worth of stats for  mana. which is  points underbudgeted. Because of the choose one effect its more like . points underbudgeted. Its important to note that we do not add the bonus point back under any circumstances so three s s are collectively one . As for the first effect theres not much to say. The second effect needed some explanation though. Hopefully this helped your understanding of multiminion cards. All minions can be judged like this for single minions its merely a choice of how you want to look at the card but for multiminion cards this way of thinking is absolutely essential because it is the most accurate way. TLDR Three s are actually s with . Thus we judge them as s and they are collectively a . A  is good but its not good enough for the cost of the card.,customhearthstone,cuzwam4,2,t5_30mve

It is more versatile cheaper for a same effect and you can specify the target and can be used for burst damage. One of the ideas behind glacier was to provide synergy with scorch   turns of randomly freezing minions by itself. I feel it isnt too overpowered as it is  very easy to destroy as a turn   dies to just about anything  silenced to create a pointless  on the board but isnt rendered useless as you can use taunt atk spare parts on it to revive it and  the randomization of the freeze makes it reasonably easy to play around by playing many small minions rather than few big ones.

6134252,0,t1_cymw695,Hmm that seems really weak in my eyes. I could consider changing it into a legendary so you can only put one into your opponents deck.

6145017,0,t1_cynxcgd,It dont see how this card would be all that great for aggro. Playing on curve is a big deal for aggro decks and this card makes  cards cost one additional mana so your curve would be thrown off. Drawing cards isnt as important for aggro decks as playing on curve since you want to end the game before you need to draw cards anyway. I see this card working for control rogues or reno rogues. Control decks are the opposite of aggro they dont care about their curve as much but card draw is important. This card would obviously serve as a second Sprint in reno rogue. ,customhearthstone,cyo4gul,4,t5_30mve

Most playable  drops have a beneficial upside i.e. chow has boosted stats abusive grants attack etc. Although most  drops will be a downgrade from those usually played the Barracks General provides a soft taunt and a decision to clear the newly spawned  drop or take out the  health general.Another idea is to make him a  mana  with inspire or at the endstart of your turn.

That being said with a few tweaks it could be an interesting card. Some ideas Really no point in the double damage thing if you just lower the hp a bit. At  mana  attack with no instant effect is actually quite poor on something that dies to shadow word pain or a spare part.The mech deathrattle is Ok at best. Simply cutting it might simplify it enough.One way to make it an actual threat would be to change the hearts end of turn effect into a massive aoe tantrum from the encounter.

6258252,0,t3_4187i8,Extremely cool card. I think its honestly a strictly better Sprint for Oil Rogue since its not dead earlygame Oil Rogue rarely spends their turn  mana and often just daggers on turn  this card could replace one of those turns and drawing a single copy ensures that you will never run out of draw against control decks. It also combos well with Violet Teacher on turn  for example. or T Teacher Coin this card which in addition to the traditional Teacher Coin Deadly would add quite a lot of power to the Teachers. It wouldnt be run in Miracle which doesnt run sprint anyway and has enough cheap cycle spells.Its too slow for Aggro Rogue most variants dont run Sprint nowadays Coldlights seem to be more popular lately. In response to the person who said that  copies is too much I dont really see the issue. I think its fine since Rogue will very rarely cast more than  or  of the Sprints. I think that  and even  copies is functionally nearly identical to  so in the end it doesnt matter much imo. This card isnt enough to make Rogue play Mountain Giant considering how it doesnt synergize with any other Rogue cards at all Prep and Backstab  of the defining Rogue staples trade cards for tempo for example.

It is also something that triggers with Battlecry or Deathrattle. So Kaelthas makes no sense at all.Dragons Treasure is WAY OP as Dragons cost a lot most of the time and that basically shoves  coins in your handArcane Knowledge basically gives you  cards for  mana. Its over a select amount of time But that is still OP as well. Imbue Spellbook basically draws out the game way too long for an insanely cheap cost.Kirin Tor Witch would have troubles reading the damage a spell does as some spells dont have damage and the engine isnt built for knowing such. Arcane Stun needs to be atleast a  mana for what it does.

6771510,0,t3_48grnr,I think this card is a bit too strong. While class cards can be better than neutrals they usually arent that much more powerful. . The strength of pit fighter is that she had really good stats for the cost and thats it.  None of the other good stats for the cost minions have better class versions. The only contender is lost tall strider and savage combatant and tallstrider is crap. Pitfighter on the other hand is a very strong card in arena and if it werent for sylvanas she might even see play in standard.  I think this card would be better off as a  not too much of a downgrade but enough to where it doesnt one shot  health minions which is a huge breakpoint. ,customhearthstone,d0jtyud,4,t5_30mve

In addition to that youre getting a free reveal of your opponents deck very early in the game. Id say change it to either if it costs  or less gain  or if it costs  or less gain .As far as the other cards go Rocketeer should probably damage all minions as someone else already pointed out. Nothing else really seems jarringly out of place.

7206042,0,t3_4e5x2p,While I realise that the theme of Thunder and Shock etc. is usually related with Shaman I made Robin a Druid card simply because of the Choose One effect that Druid has available to it.I tried to make this as similar to Robins Thunder in Super Smash Bros as I could. For those of you who dont know what Thunder does in Smash it is an electricitybased attack that you can charge over time. You can cast it at anytime during the charging phase but the longer you wait the more powerful Thunder becomes eventually turning into the farreaching KOinducing Thoron.EDIT I have seen all the changes people have suggested and here are the tweaks I think are suitable.

7329172,0,t3_4fpuy3,I honestly dont see any reason for these secrets to deal damage to your hero AND cost  mana. Its pretty steep.Blood Pact seems weak dont see any reason to play it since youre still going to take partial damage and you may lose a minion on the board. It could function differently such as gain armor  to twice the health of one of your minions that minion is destroyed. Then it would see play easily.Archimonde isnt bad as a legendary but giving his weapon  durability seems silly. It would be just as effective to give it  durability because either way its destroyed by Acidic Ooze. Having it at  just makes it a hard counter to Harrison Jones.Giving it Spell Damage  is also kind of nuts. Its going to let you dominate the board as Archimonde with even a few cards. His hero power will give you hard removal as well. When it hits for  damage you got either an Jarraxus or a MalGanis on the board while  damage gets you nothing.Lastly the trigger for Archimonde is kind of weak. Fatal damage is unavoidable unless you win so having a guaranteed comeback for  mana is nuts. Maybe require a certain amount of minions to die while the secret is in play to trigger it? Or have at least  demons in play anything but fatal damage.,customhearthstone,d2b9zix,4,t5_30mve

Their biggest minions suddenly become unplayable until Thassarian dies  unless they die first. The relative scarcity of highquality standard deathrattle minions means that the deck will be short on powerful minions so spells would be in high number in a Thassarian deck accompanied only by the more powerful deathrattle minions.

Tricky to get decent value out of though especially next to Shield Slam I think you could stand to lower the cost to  or even .Seeds of the Lasher Slightly worse than what Twilight Drake was prenerf and I dont recall Druids being one of the classes to make use of it back then anyway. Its hard to say that this is a particularly good card I think Id prefer to just play Mountain Giant for a consistent  that might be more expensive.Worgen Flamecaster Seems pretty fair Id argue you could even justify it as a . As worded you could play it one turn and save the effect for the next two of these on turn  to follow up with a  damage Flamestrike for example but you cant play any nondamaging spell in the meantime without wasting the effect so the utility is limited in that sense.Draenei Flamebender Feels like a bigger Ironforge Rifleman with the potential for a bigger battlecry if you already have control of the board. I think its worth playing just because it would force your opponents to play around it by clearing your totems instead of just ignoring them in many cases.Quick Strike Comparable to what Blade Flurry used to be IMO. I think this would be a bit much if that was still around Buff gt Attack gt Quick Strike Face gt Blade Flurry but since thats been nerfed I think this could be allowed as a burn spell that encourages rogues to build up a weapon again.Northshire Guardian Slightly smaller Sunwalker essentially. Not too much to say really its thematic to Paladin and probably fair on the cost.Rain of Arrows Very interesting for a spell hunter it might even make it worth running some spellpower cards to get kills more consistently.,customhearthstone,d4joj6j,5,t5_30mve

8139845,0,t1_d4uzjw8,I wont deny the possible benefits of pyromancer however the main problem is you are adding weak spells in you deck that are not worth the card slot. Sure you can trigger a wirlwind effect but you cannot buff you pyromancer to do more than  and you are trading major late game potential if you put too many cheap spells for this effect. In NZoth Paladin you only have a few probably  x Humility and x equality that combo well early with pyro and that deck runs  pyro. And these are premium spells with extremely strong hard removal either with the pyro equality or humilitykodo. Also turn  Final Breath into turn  Hunted by Worgs and finally destroying them at turn  is so bad its funny. So much worse than Doomsayer for sure. Three turn delayed clearance is probably bottom three worst clearances in the game. As I said this class loses to aggro and tempo. This class could last well with its own tempo deck that counters other midlate orientated decks but has no burn for finishing. Whats the win condition? All decks have a clear win condition card but this one is missing that. E.g. Bloodlust Hellscream etc.,customhearthstone,d4v0yih,1,t5_30mve

Anduin being considered an equal power level to some of the other heroes something something priest is garbage.

I guess you are right in some way but the thing is since it is discovery you can choose the one you want that was kind of the problem with flare since you dont know the matchup beforehand.So when you play against freeze mage you simply have a  of discovering Disarm Trap and just simply winning the game. But if you are up against rogue you can pick Kick.I get the logic behind Kick being balanced but the problem is that Lotheb required you to spend some mana to disrupt your enemy.

9361038,0,t1_d92kev5,There needs to be a mechanism that both players can interact with even if only slightly. If it is a priest card lets just tie its cost to healing in some way. Perhaps each time you heal a character beyond full health reduce his cost by that much and set his base cost to whatevs. The card is revealed each time this happens and as such opponents now have to play around the idea of you overhealing. They will attempt to interact with your board to prevent you having a big board to cast circle of healing on. they will attack your face just enough so you cant heal face. Weapon classes will try to not be at or near full health as you can trigger off them as well you naughty boy. Naga sea witch is still a big problem here and honestly the card limits the design space of cards like this. maybe we need a clause that prevents his cost from being altered extraneously. Even if we bring him to a castable amount He simply needs to represent a large threat. a  with taunt and is untargetable by spellshero powers.

9641087,0,t1_da01wlb,Came here to say this. Lots of super cool ideas love the set dude. But Loksey is completely broken. Imagine this what if Justicar was  mana? Even if it was a  mana ? It would probably see play in all  classes because of the insane value. Imagine being warlock and getting to draw cards for free after turn ? Or being a mage with a  damage hero power turn ? It would just be so insane for every class except maybe shaman. This is why Justicar is such a high mana cost because it makes her awkward to play early. You have to lose tempo by playing her because the effect is so good and thats why only control runs her generally. Now then. This hero power is in my opinion far far better than ANY upgrade Justicar can give. First of all bodies with charge need to be balanced very carefully. Look at how many times Blizzard has nerfed charge mechanics in the past its clear that charge can have some deadly combos that break the game. This hero power makes hunter a PREMIUM combo deck class. Just load your deck with this card and lots of buffs and it basically plays itself. But possibly even more crazy is that its a beast. Look how many existing hunter cards ALREADY have If you have a beast X or Give a beast X. There are people who run cards like on the hunt and even unleash the hounds JUST so they can have a beast to activate kill command. If the hunter hero power can summon beasts even if they were  with no charge... it would still be totally insane to be able to NOT HAVE TO TOP DECK A BEAST TO PLAY SYNERGISTIC CARDS. Again wrote all this because I love the set and I think it should get more exposure! D But if I was playing these cards I would make getting this insane hero power one of the WIN CONDITIONS of the entire deck. Thats how good I think it is. So if you want it to be played in control you have to do what Blizz did to Justicar and make the mana cost very high. This will stop aggro from playing it. Otherwise it would be a MUST HAVE in every deck and possibly create some hunter OTK decks!TLDR Love the set! Make Loksey at least  or  mana though if you want it to be a control card and not a card that every deck must run. You could even make it say cant target heroes as a start? not sure. ,customhearthstone,da1gnps,1,t5_30mve

Id argue in favor of deaths bite personally because in addition to its ability to help clear the board it also has several cards that strongly synergize with it. Execute grim patron armorsmith acolyte of pain and frothing berserker not to mention enrage minions like bloodhoof brave all synergize with it very well.  There are very few synergies with silence in the game and those that there are are not used in even slightly competitive decks or in any rogue gimmick decks. Deaths bite is probably the second best weapon in the game behind war axe excluding ashbringer.Id say something along the lines of thisS Tier fiery war axe deaths biteA Tier in no particular order Eaglehorn bow truesilver champion doomhammer gorehowl tentacles for arms.

Of course you could sub out either one of the Abusives for a Prep  EvisShadowstrike but those tend to be pretty useful for helping survive to the late game and subsequently doing the combo. Im sure youd see people complain about power creep if this was printed and a lot of people trying combos but in the end I dont think this is so OP that it will warant rogues running all these combo pieces.

Not just because of the combo potential with malygos in hand but because even without having malygos being able to play sprint and every other draw spell for  to dig for him is too good. With shiv fan and sprint it would be way too easy to just play this card and draw half of your deck next turn and if you ever draw maly you basically just win. I think the best solution is just make it that spells all cost  or  less so that you cant double sprint for  mana to dig for malygos you have to actually have it in your hand or at least dig with cheap cycle spells.

That would mean you still have about  cards left in your deck. So when it dies the chances you will draw it again any time soon are slim.Then we have to think about how slow this card is. In order to start getting value out of this card it will need to die four times.

10851857,0,t1_ddz9ibx,I kind of think of it in comparison to that druid minion that gives an extra mana crystal so long as its alive.  That has okay synergy since the enemy wants to kill it while you want to silence it so you can keep its battlecry effect.  The opposite can be really oppressive.  Enemy doesnt want to kill it until they can silence it whereas you want to get a lot of value out of it at the severe risk of leaving it on the board.Not sure if it would be healthy for the game or not.,customhearthstone,ddzaj2d,6,t5_30mve

Now in regards to the mech hero power. It may be powerful but the current Mechs that are available I doubt UnGoro will have strong mechs as well affects this. By including mechs into your deck youre actually worsening your deck quality.    Realistically I see only Harvest Golem as the only contender at the moment and that will have to be saved until turn  at the earliest to proc the effect and that is a massive tempo loss.

It also gives your opponent a choice either get rid of their minion somehow by trading or other effect or keep taking damage. It also forces them to think about trades a little more. On the other hand you can trigger the effect yourself using Fan of Knives Blade Flurry or Wild Pyromancer.I made it  mana because it has a lot of different conditions that must be met opponent must have a relevant number of minions that have more than  health they must be enraged they must stay on the board for more value.
