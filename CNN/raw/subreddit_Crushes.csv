9118896,0,t3_5544ib,Well I suppose time will tell in this case. For most people its just an endless unknowing. If you are interested in him my only advice would be to make it almost blatantly obvious if you really want him to know. Most people including me are ridiculously thick when it comes to signals. I actually had someone ask me out last April and I didnt even realize it until a few weeks ago.,Crushes,d87xyza,2,t5_2udig

10283190,0,t3_5n31tn,Theres a few pieces of info that would help me help you. First off who told you that she likes you? Also are you completely sure that shes started seeing her ex again? Until you answer Ill just assume that another person told you and she hasnt started seeing her ex again.Personally I would ask if shes in a relationship first. Make it a simple question and dont make her suspicious. If shes in a relationship either wait it out or move on. Only wait it out if youre that desperate.Alternatively if shes not in a relationship take it slow. Be friendly and occasionally flirt. Dont use any cheesy pickup lines unless youre that type of person. If you find out youve become friendzoned youre out of luck. Wait it out or move on. But if youre more than  sure that she likes you back become more romantic per say.Im not an entirely credible source but either way good luck to you!,Crushes,dc9nmnu,1,t5_2udig

10378579,0,t3_5ogree, Sometimes that happens and thats okay. A long time ago I had a crush on a guy I couldnt understand my feelings at the time and I got nervous and pushed him away. We are friends still but sometimes I regret pushing him away. The good thing is though there are a lot of other fish in the sea. If you caught one you can catch another one. Dont stress me see where life takes you in the meantime. Maybe you can still catch this one or maybe life has a different guy in store for you. Good luck!  ,Crushes,dckh53m,3,t5_2udig
