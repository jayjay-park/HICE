143794,0,t1_ceub8k5,Just wanted to follow up we found that by using flash for safari and IE we could save  on storage and transcoding. Most likely we will put a message telling people that they are using flash and should get a better browser that supports webm.,BitVid,ceut4tq,2,t5_2z7ir
148286,0,t3_1vqma6,I appreciate the effort but I think that BitVid should go for minimalism over excitement. The page looks too busy. Of course I am not the one making the decisions here.,BitVid,cevbjwu,1,t5_2z7ir
152961,0,t3_1vt8wn,I like it but I feel that there is a lack of customization and branding at the top. I like the One Channel banner actually. Maybe there can be something like that above the featured video.,BitVid,cevuqt1,1,t5_2z7ir
431851,0,t1_cfphr68,People do it now. on a recent video i have a little over  views.  likes and about  comments.  dislike. If people like the video AND your are engaging with your audience people leave comments.People who like your videos have a MUCH higher propensity to leave a comment. people who just dont like you are more likely to just leave a dislikedownvote because they can hide behind the veil of internet anonymity. I want to know WHY someone dislikes the content. it may be something that is a disagreement and i cant do anything about it or it could be that my audio is a little high and i can adjust it.If its just a dislike with a fbalbfuk comment i can delete it and go about my business.,BitVid,cfpiyaa,-2,t5_2z7ir

2307352,0,t3_2lmtud,People didnt get used to it and that was it. There was still lots of complaints and Google IIRC a while back said they werent going to try to force it into it anymore and it seems like they havent comments dont seem to require you having Google anymore etc.,BitVid,clwwloa,-1,t5_2z7ir
