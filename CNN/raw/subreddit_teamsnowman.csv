5660631,0,t1_cwyr1ar,I used to do bodyweight stuff but I stopped because I hated feeling so weak and out of shape and the progressions didnt make me feel better. For whatever reason CK doesnt make me feel like that even though Im a slowwww runner. Im hoping to start Strong Lifts in a bit though Im really short on time at the moment so going to the gym is out of the question. ,teamsnowman,cwyr7qx,1,t5_3afl7

5710419,0,t3_3tc89z,Yes!It was my husbands birthday yesterday and I made him a homemade apply pie from scratch. Of course I m going to have a piece. I MAKE IT ONCE A YEAR.  I am finding that I can no longer drink more than a beer. I always go for the second one but then I cant finish it and I give it to my husband. So thats going for me. Also despite not being able to get a job I am not emotionally eating.,teamsnowman,cx4xlum,7,t5_3afl7
6168285,0,t3_40185a,Ending challenge stats SW   CW .  GW  in lbsWhile I didnt make my goal weight I did lose a little over eight pounds during this holiday challenge had been shooting for eleven. While I was far from perfect when it came to staying disciplined about Christmas cookies or Thanksgiving mashed potatoes and gravy and especially NYE cocktails! this challenge did throw sharply into perspective the way in which I ate before during the holidays in previous years.  I never really weighed myself regularly before this point but Im willing to bet if not paying attention with MFP I would have absolutely gained weight over this holiday period instead of losing it.  So even though I didnt make my GW thats a huge victory for me. I also had a couple of great growing experiences throughout this challenge in terms of how I look at the number on the scale fluctuations are frustrating but okay and my emotional relationship with food wanting to binge when youre sad is just wanting to change the emotion youre currently feeling which food cant do. Im still so proud of the midDecember K I ran.  I am going to be the team captain over at rteamconfetti for our next challenge.  I hope to see many of you participating in the next challenge and I hope even more to be working with you on my team!!  I hope to hit my overall GW in the next challenge  lbs.  Itll be tough but Im up for the challenge! Dont be a stranger! ,teamsnowman,cyqrqiv,3,t5_3afl7
