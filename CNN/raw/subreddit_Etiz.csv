9993233,0,t1_dba4ziu,Juice as in done? Etiz is the ONLY diazepine Ive taken with methadone that doesnt add to the sedation at ALL if anything I feel even more energized.   Ive even taken some pretty high doses for research.   While on mg done.   No sedation at all.   Its the weirdest thing  But I have to be Mr safe and say one person is a small sample size so start slow.   With how low of a dose youre on... Youre gonna be fine with pretty much any benzo.   The deaths you gear about are people mixing benzos with doses of done mg crazy stuff... ,Etiz,dba59wp,1,t5_3hrw4
10059559,0,t1_dbikvug,Right on looking forward to hearing more about them in the future. I will probably go ahead and place a small order after the holidays to try them out and of course to add a couple of blisters to the collection heh.,Etiz,dbis9mj,1,t5_3hrw4
10075033,0,t3_5k08ey,Very nice! Im hoping that one of my vendors was in the giving spirit with my most recent order of Clam liquid. Cmon Flam sample!! Lol.. Would be a nice holiday treat.. Happy Holidays man! ,Etiz,dbksr7b,2,t5_3hrw4
10116809,0,t1_dbq3e69,Lol nice indirect selfpromoting and I agree.  Honestly I think you deserve any new free samples that pop up due to all the research youve done so far that has most definitely saved people money and trouble and youve probably prevented anything bad happening to fellow researchers a few times from you personally researching bunk or mislabeled chemicals and that takes balls man Id be too paranoid of an unknown new vendor for all I know it could be ISIS sending me anthrax to research.,Etiz,dbq87xg,1,t5_3hrw4
