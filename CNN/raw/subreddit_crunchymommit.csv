6076247,0,t3_3ys1o0,Are you me from the past? I swear my kid was the same and we had the same set up. Im not gonna lie sleep has always been the hardest thing for this kid. But a few things helped! I think around  weeks I started letting him sleep in the swing at night in our room or just outside the door in the hallway. Before that he only slept well on my chest but woke a lot for nursing and after a month it was just too uncomfortable for me. The motion helped soothe his flailing. He hated and would just not sleep well on a flat surface like the cosleeper or pack and play. This eventually changed but he really liked to be held and the swing was cozier. With any sleep transition Ive found that gradual is better. I tried the swing during day naps for a few days before adding it at night. Worked great finally started getting a  hour stretch! Would bring him in bed rest of night. He didnt sleep through the night for a long time. Around  months he transitioned to the pack and play and around  months moved to his own room. I didnt have a schedule or any idea when to do these things but just tried to problem solve when sleep stopped working for a week. He has slept through the night since a year and we just transitioned him to toddler bed with little fuss! Hes  months now.,crunchymommit,cyg2xlf,1,t5_369v5
