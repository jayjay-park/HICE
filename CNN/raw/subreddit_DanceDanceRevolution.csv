For example the beginning of the chart shows a highly syncopated rhythm but had the chart been at the sane tempo as the song the chart would have had straight eighth notes. The tempo was deliberately incorrect just to invoke yellow arrow syndrome. Likewise later in the chart theres a freeze jump section with exaggerated accelerandos and ritardandos in the chart even though the song doesnt change tempo whatsoever during the section.,DanceDanceRevolution,cty26u7,2,t5_2s3qp

You can take as many shots at each round as youd like and Ill take your most recent answer as final. At the end of each round i.e. when the next round starts youll get one point for every song youve guessed correctly. Ill keep a tally of all users scores in a Google Docs spreadsheet. Solutions for each round will no longer be accepted after the end of each round and full solutions will be posted in the next rounds thread along with the number of people whove solved each song. In the spirit of fairness points will accumulate starting from this round so no points will be awarded retroactively. Congratulations to thsoe whove done well in previous rounds though! First solved by honors will still be awarded but no extra points will be given for them  Feel free to post all GtDDRS discussion in these posts! Since all answers have been moved to PMs well need more discussion to keep things lively around here!

Machines are new and in good working order.I havent been to Family Arcade or whatever its called across the street from LA City College in a long time... I used to go somewhat regularly about a year ago but the staff are really rude. The DDR machines are almost always super quiet and next to really noisy other arcade games... like theyre super loud even when theyre not being used. Ive asked them to turn up the volume and they make excuses to not do anything... so thats frustrating.

Local hardware store a  foot  inch diameter PVC pipe can be only a few dollars.Examples of parts though I recommend not ordering and just going to local store ft pipe  inch  degree connecting PVC elbowsPVC cementYoull likely need more parts than that but it depends on your personal setup. If you have a metal mat here are a few ways Ive seen it done.
