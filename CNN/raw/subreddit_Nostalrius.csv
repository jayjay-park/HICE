5377975,0,t3_3oomjp,Loving the game play server quality populationpvp pve everything about this server rocks.  I would just like to see a few things adopted that make sense.  Secondly I really hope that the Addons that make pvp easy are not allowed on the server.  I think that Vanilla WOW pvp was so great because addons were there to make the interface look more pretty help with auction house etc... Addons that tell a player to do this or that in pvp just takes the overall skill out of pvp. I am sure there are more people out there that agree with me on this topic. Addons that make the game more user friendly are great.. But please keep pvp addons to a minimum.,Nostalrius,cvz3hy1,-7,t5_36mxn
5378617,0,t1_cu7evow,I have a  or smth character on the PvP realm and it was annoying getting ganked in Redridge and stuff. Just like you I dont have the time and patience but not to start over but to keep dying for no reason because some people find it amusing to go around ganking people.Im not saying its bad it just gets boring over time Id rather spend my time leveling up my character than going around ruining the fun for other people thus wasting my time not achieving anything. If anything the battlegrounds will be more populated since world PvP wont be enabled and this makes perfect sense Im actually encouraged to start fresh with everyone else.A few days ago I deleted my WoW since there were still bugged quests on the PvP realm... I dont get this the game is  years old dont they have a ManGOS or whatever it was called core where everything is scripted at this point?!

With regards to the territory who said dont pick Mage lock priest etc. Yes if you do this you will compete for gear but gear is only so important and at the higher levels of play you will have a ton of ppl competing for gear anyways it wont matter.

7222049,0,t1_d1yz5gy,All I know is that the short time I spent on the vanilla version gave me more joy in this game than all the years after WotLK combined.I had forgotten how to socialize in WoW. Really at a time if someone told me everyone I saw was an NPC and not a player I would have given it a thought as a plausible scenario because I didnt interact anymore and nor did everyone else. While wandering around in vanilla people would randomly whisper me asking if I wanted to join as healtankdps for x dungeon. Now they dont talk at all inside the dungeon itself. I have been kicked for talking too much by saying hello and asking why they dont respond back. I also remembered all the zones I had gone through questing back then and I still did mostly while playing on Nostalrius. This cannot be said about zones after WotLK for example. Everybody did them so fast that they felt more of a placeholder than an adventure also azeroth changed so everything got messed up. Flying mounts were also a big contributor to this.With all these conveniences I wonder what is the real purpose of having to level up anymore. Its boring everybody does LFD everywhere else is empty and its not even a slight challenge. This has become by no means of sarcasm a Massively Looking for Dungeon game up until max level. Then it becomes a Massively Looking for Raid game obviously.,Nostalrius,d1z3byn,3,t5_36mxn

And thats alright too they dont really need to promote legacy realms.Releasing Legion gt Content Drought  gt Release legacy realms  gt New expansion comes out a year after legacy realms arrive and thus  the royalty would no longer be there so people would flock to the new expansion to test it and try that until the legacy gets updated with TBC.

7394204,0,t3_4gir23,Its been proven quite a few times that for MMORPGs which change drastically its a good way of getting some of the old audience back into subscribing. As various people have said including Boogie every person dreaming of trying WoW have tried it by now while there is still new people trying the game its not the main source for new subscribers anymore. Theres a potential large group of people to win by making legacy servers Nostalrius proved that and they basically shot down the whole rosetinted goggles nostalgia thing. People actually wanted to play the vanilla experience. million or how many current subscribers there is is paying to play the retail game. Is legacy servers going to bring in even close to those numbers? Not at all. Its unrealistic. But the k people they win probably closer to  or k will be the most stable subscribers there is because they are subscribing to a World of Warcraft they know. Theres no fear of them cancelling their subscription because they dont like where the game is going because of changes.We have to look at these two groups as people who loves playing World of Warcraft and not as enemies where whoever have the most players is the better version. Each version of the game Retail vanilla TBC WOTLK cater to two very different groups of players so it wouldnt be fair to compare the groups.As many people have mentioned it would be possible to play retail WoW and when you have a very boring period like now where were waiting for new content it would be a excellent idea to have legacy servers to fall back on where the timeline goes much slower and content usually is farmed for much longer due to the nature of raids and drop rates of items.I think pristine servers is bullshit and theyre offering nothing close to the vanilla experience but we have to be objective here. It will take some time to make the Legacy severs because of the fact that no developer or brand with any self respect would ship legacy servers like they were shipped at launch. Theres no DX support the view distance is garbage with random fog to give the illusion of not being able to see that far and other performance issues and countless of other QoL issues. The game runs worse than retail WoW. They would have to figure out some way for addons to be easier to install since anybody remotely new to the game would have a hard time finding . versions of addons. Also Battle.net will take some time to get integrated into the client which is something they will have to do. Thats their trademark and station for all of their games.Do I think honestly think its a showcase of a bad design team if legacy servers is a success?  Not at all it took WoW  expansions to become what it is today its not one change which made it into a shitgodly game but rather a lot of big and small changes. Retail WoW is the best version of WoW there is in terms of getting the highest amount of subscribers. Anyone who actually think WOTLK would net in  million players or close to in  is delusional.And before people call me a Blizzard fanboy. My subscription is cancelled until legacy servers launch or until retail WoW seems interesting to me which it doesnt seem like it ever will.

As much as he says that it is above his paygrade you definitely get the impression that his thought processes align with Blizzards and his thoughts seem to be that what we want is just a better levelling experience.He totally disregards the complaints about LFD LFR Transmog gold inflation player reputation and anonymity and what it means for server community.Seriously wondering how this discussion between Nostalrius and Blizzard is going to go because it feels like Blizzard either doesnt get it or doesnt want to get it. Theyre not thinking like players anymore like we see in their earlier Blizzcon panels. Theyre thinking about how to make the game more accessible more fun they treat it like a product rather than a game that they would like to play.

This subreddit and subsequently this push for legacy servers is to bring back the original format of WoW. Theres not much room for opinion. Its either you support and want to play vanilla wow or you do not. In which case have no reason to share your opinion....other than to let everyone know that you one were too young and didnt play the originalso arent sure what to expect or two just want attention for not wanting to play vanilla wow or dislike it altogether.Either way if you dont like wow in its original format really have no reason to be in a subreddit that is pushing to get support for legal legacy servers rather than keeping up on illegal private servers.,Nostalrius,d3anx4g,1,t5_36mxn

But I think we are kidding ourselves if we think that class balance as of the end of Vanilla was somehow a masterpiece.

7809832,0,t3_4m5y6f,Sure. Some quests are retarded and it would be fun with more tanks. Would of course be fun with some other stuff too. I love Vanilla WoW. Its not perfect though so Im going be a bit more aggressive with my suggestions than most guys in here.Quest related things Fix the lack of mobs that are required for quests. This could be when you have a quest that requires you to kill more mobs than there may exist at the same time. it could also be if a quest item got a really low drop chance and there only are a few mobs. Either improve the respawn time or increase the number of mobs.Itemization There are a lot of useless items that just gets vendored. My suggestion is to add fun effects to them instead of buffing their stats. Also since there is a lack of tanks add more tank gear to Paladins and Druids.Classes Warrior Make Thunderclap and Mocking Blow usable in Defensive Stance! Paladin Make this class viable for raidmt tanking but dont make it a copy of the Warrior. My suggestion is to change anticipation to increase defense aquired from gear by some percent say   or whatever. The reason is to make Paladins focus on getting Holy Damage and MP from gear to increase threat and sustainability instead of focusing on Defense gear like Warriors.Give it some type of Taunt.Increase duration of Blessings... Druid Make this class viable for raidmt tanking. Addchange talents to make up for the lack of Shield Block.PvP Add Arena with Arena Rating and Arena rewards! Dont make rewards casual though. You gotta aim high if you want those rewards. Also make Arena Rating progressive such that it would take several months to claim the final rewards but in the sense that it should be based on skill and not unemployment. Doing arena  shouldnt make you progress faster being skilled should. Do something about Alterac Valley it seriously sucks. Probably the worst thing in Vanilla Wow.Other stuff Move both the Alliance and the Horde flight paths in Searing George so that they are seperated and that none of them are in Thorium Point. Add summoning stones outside dungeons that requires  people to use. This is in case one group member disconnects or just go BM and leaves.  people still have to actually go there. Add LOS on objects and debris that are larger than or same size as Humans such as trees large stonesrocks etc. Things that makes sense... Make Resistance stats reduce damage taken from their respective school of spells instead of giving them a chance to resist a spell all together. Make AllianceHorde leaders drop better rewards. We need more city sieges  Continue adding more content after Naxxramas been released dont increase level cap though!.,Nostalrius,d3tw0np,-1,t5_36mxn

They have multiple VERY SUCCESSFUL games they are focusing on. Games much more popular than the Legacy servers. Games that arguably have more longevity in the current climate. Legacy WoW is not their top priority at the moment. Its silly how impatient the Nostalrius community is. Its like we should expect Blizzard to rush out Legacy and make an announcement all within a few months.They have WoW with the new expansion and a big patch being added. Diablo  Heros of the Storm Hearthstone and Overwatch.That is a lot of games they are working on and developing. And the Nostalrius community really expects Blizzard to shove all of that aside and make the biggest announcement at their show bringing back an old game that the vast majority of their customers dont care about?I know that last comment is just going to light a fire under your ass but whether you care to admit it or not Legacy servers are not top priority. The  people who signed the petition pale in comparison to the people playing WoW Hearthstone and Overwatch. Blizzard isnt going to ignore it. They will announce their intentions when the time is right. Blizzcon is not the right time for them. They want the focus of Blizzcon on their current games not on Legacy an old game.

Do you dispute that?Also there are multiple other servers around the world including in France that have received many CampD letters without any further legal action including for example Valkyrie which has been around for over  years and was quite popular at its peak. So while it may be true that Nost felt they had to shut because of legal action it looks like it was not the case that there was no other way around it.

The hardest part about vanilla raiding is getting the gear needed to do the bosses not the bosses themselves except a select few. Pretty sure any mythic raid is mechanically harder than anything that existed in vanilla.

Like I played mage and you get  stacks of a spell that allows you to cast while running a double blink usable while casting its like it doesnt matter if my positionning is good I can always dodge abilities and reposition and avoid dying my character just feels so strong.

10000245,0,t1_dbatx67,gt You cannot test your nostalrius password unless youve already moved your account over which there would be point in testing your password. The only way to test your nostalrius password if it is different than your forum credentials is to test it with the nostalrius realmlist but the old servers havent been up since it went down.To test your Nost password you must fill login and password fields. If both are OK then you will receive token otherwise error message will show.If you fill all  fields then it will behave exactly the same way as if you filled login and email fields.

So whatever you pick you save for being able to do pve. though if you are a shamandruidpriest you gonna be a healer in pve.pick hunter maybe if you want something uncommon. if you are skilled and enjoy this class they good for both pve and pvp. but it requies good hands bad hunter will be bad in both pvp an pve.though warriors are the best with a pocket healer ofc. though its traditional and nothing uncommon . warlock can also work with a priest since you help survive to each other and enemies die from dots.and mage can peel off melees for priest healer. so its good duo aswell.Tbh in vanilla its such a time investement you need to enjoy and feel comfortable in that charachters skin to play it its the most important thing.
