127115,0,t3_1vhuow,Im the commish in my league. I was  when I made a bet with one of the worst teams that I could beat him with Tim Tebow as my starting QB and if I lost I would start Tebow for the rest of the regular season.That weekend I went to the JetsRavens game down in Baltimore. Had a great time at the game with a couple guys in my league. I was on the highway driving back home when I got a text from someone in the league said Im a cheater. Not know what was going on I had to wait till I got home an hour later to figure out what they were talking about.When I got home I looked at my computer and saw that my account made two transactions mid game switching one of my WRs out for another WR. The entire league was out to get me and I was confused as hell. Turns out that a couple days before I showed my neighbor my lineup on his computer and never logged out. He switched my lineup because No commish should have the best record in his league as a joke. I was so mad at him and lost the trust of everyone in my league. They made me send out my lineup the night before for the rest of the season. I made it to the championships and lost but people kept saying I cheated my way to the championships. It sucks because I didnt do anything. From now on Ill show my lineup to people on my phone. ,FFCommish,ceswnbe,1,t5_2vtq9

Whoevers face it stops on does a shot so someone could theoretically do  or  shots each turn. Hold your shot glasses. After  turns whoever has the most shot glasses is last and so on.

At any time if anyone complains about the amount of alcohol being consumed comments on how drunk they are or expresses a desire to stop drinking they get slapped by everyone still alive in the game OR must do a body shot off of the fattest hairiest guy in the league. For example the first one to complain would choose between taking  slaps or a nasty shot. The next guy takes  slaps the first guy out is not allowed to slap or a nasty shot and so on.

That being said  hear them out they may have some interesting alternative but if all they have is bitching then you can play hardball.  Youre the commish ultimately in charge if you have a vision for how you want it to operate and they dont present any reasonable alternatives then you can shoot it down.

9274547,0,t3_57ftig,I guess that largely depends on the precedent you want to set here.   You have options within the system but the question is do you already have some sort of rule set external to the system that covers this type scenario at all.    What I would do personally is Call Team s Owner and tell them that they have to drop a player.  It can be the player they just added or a different player of their choosing.   Then i would have them resubmit the trade and manually approve.   You also have the option to enforce the rules as set by Yahoo which is why they received the error message in the first place.   Either way if you dont have an external rule set for situations outside the control of the game settings you should develop one.   If you do I would make sure to use this as an example and add it for next season.   ,FFCommish,d8rm594,3,t5_2vtq9

Nobody available on waivers very difficult to find reasonable trade partners and thanks to all the injuries this season most teams are already out of contention.
