3404079,0,t3_2z78fo,Representative ExampleRepresentative examples are a great way to get lots of use out of a single example. The representative example uses a single example to illustrate many different points from the single example. The example should be a complex strong example in order for the writer to be able to draw enough from the example in order to use it throughout the essay. The general rule to determine if the example is useable is the  to  rule meaning drawing at least  points from the one example. This feature of critical inquiry writing requires writers to draw out as much meaning as possible from an example by thinking beyond the example by analyzing it as well as focusing essay around the example. In my presentation essay I use the subreddit rIamA as my representative example. It is a useful example to analyze because there are numerous interactions between average people and famous people like actors celebrities and CEOs. From these interactions I used the example in my essay to make claims about uncertainty and curiosity. In one section of my essay I use the this representative example as a AMA from Peter Dinklage and Bill Gates to claim that perhaps the reason why users are so interested in celebrity AMAs is perhaps because they are curious about lifestyles that they cannot have. Due to this they use these AMAs to glean information from people like Peter Dinklage and Billgates.,ENG101Portfolio,cpgagw7,1,t5_37ezz
