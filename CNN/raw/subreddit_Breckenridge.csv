52721,0,t1_cekdpds,If youre trying to get from Breck to Colorado Springs Pikes Peak you do take  but only for about half mile of that trip.  Take Hwy  south out of Breck over Hoosier Pass to Alma and Fairplay.  In Fairplay you pick up  just as Hwy  jogs slightly.  Stay on Hwy  to Hartsel and then Hwy  to Colorado Springs.  I do this route often sometimes in an AWD SUV not a hefty WD by any means and sometimes in a little WD.  Unless youre in the middle of a blizzard it will be fine.,Breckenridge,cekfkud,2,t5_2rkss
