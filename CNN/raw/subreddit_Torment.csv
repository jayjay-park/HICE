3505699,0,t1_cpk1xs1,gt NWN MOTB expansiondlc is a gaming work of art. It was the first real spiritual successor to PST and has held up VERY well.Ive read this on many sites and it has piqued my interest as I finished PST a year ago and it became my favorite RPG of all time. The problem is that NWN as you put it yourself is a toolset more than a game. To get to Mask of the Betrayer Id need to play through NWN and expansions and NWN but from what Ive read NWN is definitely not held in high regard compared to the old Infinity engine games. I dont know if I want to begin this lengthy quest just to get to the Planescapeesque part.,Torment,cprvhtt,1,t5_2s7aw

10401794,0,t1_dcn2zjj,gt Computer Roleplaying Games cRPG is an outdated term by todays standards given the fact RPGs nowadays are mostly digital.No it isnt.  cRPG meant something specific back then and it means the same specific thing now.  As I said in the other comment cRPG refers only to computer RPGs that are based on traditionally penandpaper role playing game systems.  That distinction is why the genre cRPG was even invented in the first place.  The mere fact that an RPG is played on a computer does not necessarily make it part of the cRPG genre.gt  Might as well call them classic roleplay games because thats what they are  a call back to the oldschool RPG titles with isometric view.They are considered classics in the sense that they are old and beloved highquality RPGs but the term cRPG never morphed into meaning classic RPG as that would be silly and meaningless.  We do not refer to beloved older FPS games as cFPSs because thats not an actual genre of FPSs in of itself.gt Whoever gave my comment a thumb down needs to think outside of the box...Perhaps you should know what you are talking about before matteroffactly stating bad information and people wont feel compelled to downvote you.,Torment,dcn3z4w,7,t5_2s7aw

11030106,0,t3_5xehab,There were four joinable factions planned each with their own questline that would have introduced the player to their philosophy and would have allowed us to influence the political landscape of the setting dealing with protests undercover networks etc.. You can still find a few details about these questlines in the game files but they never seem to have made it out of the planning stage. Various NPCs in Sagus Cliffs who share no direct connection in the final game were originally meant to be important members of these factions. Membership in a faction was also meant to give you special abilities like eating the bodies of the dead to learn their memories. It looks like this ability was actually implemented at one point one check is still present in the game files but both the ability itself and the quest where the check would have been used were ultimately cut.In the release version one of these four factions was completely cut two more are present but are not joinable and offer no questline and the last one the Cult of the Changing God is joinable but does not offer a questline.,Torment,dei8k2o,5,t5_2s7aw
11035638,0,t3_5xkxqu,Ending Spoilers The thing that frustrates me the most is the ending and I dont mean the slides thats common thing with CRPGs. What annoys me is the lack of both choice and consequence. There are some consequences for your actions throughout the game but they have very little impact. Continueds Worse yet I felt that there could have been more variation in the choices. I was hoping to have an alternate to the merge castoff ending and have both the Last Castoff and Miika to become one new individual. It would have fit both the themes of the game and the setting. Also I just really like weird stuff that deals with identity.,Torment,deivbxv,2,t5_2s7aw

As a warning however the combat is still absolute trash.Personally Im back to a relative dry spell. I spent a shit ton of time waiting for Numenera and Im not ready for a second playthrough yet.

11092776,1,t3_5yeacj,I am a firm believer that people are entitled to have their own opinion about all things including games.Ive read several reviews good and bad and it seems everyone has some negative sentiment against the game. Even in good reviews youll see people giving disclaimers such as dont get the game in the current state or such.All these reviews together with the mixed rating simply echoes one thing one thing is wrong with the game. Theres one common theme among most of the negativereluctant positive reviews expectation.It seems TToN did not live to the expectation of the fans. The game started with a strong positive review on Steam which probably comes from excited peeps who played the game within the first few hours of its release and dwindled as people beat the game.Its been almost  weeks since release most people who played the game a few hours a day beat the game by now. The real opinion of the mass is starting to be formulated and were starting to see the real rating of the game.Theres always extreme when it comes to opinion. The average would reflect the general sentiment while a smaller group gonna feel either this is one outstanding game or its complete BS. Youre part of the former.All that said if you think the game is great and its worth several playthrough then go for it and pay no attention to peoples opinion.,Torment,depctzn,2,t5_2s7aw
11093213,0,t3_5yeacj,I think it boils down to this The game is good very good. Its just not good enough compared to how it was expected to be. A few things that couldshould have been better Not enough different locations two citites one part in between. Doesnt feel like much of a world to me. Seriously this is my biggest gripe and its part of the reason why the game feels short. If you compare this to lets say Baldurs Gate II the differnce is massive. In BGII you a Start in Athkatla which is fucking massive. You then travel around the Sword Coast for a bit for example you travel to a Keep to a small town Trademeet the Druid Grove Imnesvale some temple ruins the Windspear Hills including a dungeon with a dragon. After that you travel by ship to an asylum on an island which of course apart from the village on the island contains a whole dungeon. Leaving the island you arrive in a freaking underwater city. After that its off to the Underdark a huge area containing mulitple smaller dungeons and the fabled sicty of the Drow. After that its back to Athkatla and the Sword Coast where you travel around for a whole chapter again. And after that its off to the last chapter in the elven city of Suldanessellar to the Tree of Life itself and ultimately to Hell.The difference in scope is just massive. I for one would have exptected Tides to be closer to Baldurs Gate. It didnt have to be this massive but around the size of Pillars of Eternity would have been nice. Companions are kinda meh Rhin is great but her story ends way too quickly too If you wanted to make a character focused on combat youre screwed. Part of why PST was so great was that all dialogue and nonviolent options to solve a conflict were added to the combat system but it didnt replace it. Feels different in Tides.This just off the top of my head. Tides is a great game really good and I enjoyed it immensly! I just feel like I wanted a bit...more.,Torment,depem4x,14,t5_2s7aw
11099006,0,t3_5yg1lu,I have a lot of little gripes with this game but one of the biggest complaints I have is that the companions dont feel as fleshed out and polished as Id like.The companions in PST had so much more impact  they mostly felt like they belonged in TNOs story and had a purpose especially if you think of the first three companions you encounter. They had relevant history with TNO and the world and so many unique interactions  EG Dakkon when you run across all the manner of gith. The world felt much richer with them.Then there little polish issues in Tides like how the voice actors are just...ugh. I was kind of intrigued by Rhins story but I left her behind simply because her voice seemed so amateur. Callistege grew kind of grating on me by the end too. Whereas if you compare the VAs for PoE theyre much higher quality with more voiced content. I can still vividly recall Eders farmboy drawl.I dont think Tides is a bad game but I dont think it does much to appeal outside of diehard PST fans who really enjoy that text dump.,Torment,deq29ox,8,t5_2s7aw

11346873,0,t1_dfi3xzy,gt The unreliable narrator adds nothing to the story.So youre saying a device that automatically introduces multiple interpretations to a story adds nothing in terms of possible meanings or motives to hide a certain development. Okay. gtThe Claw of the Conciliator is a total bullshit plot token that is never explained.Well it is explained. Wolfe is a Catholic and the Claw of the Conciliator is kind of a miracle worker that sometimes works and sometimes doesnt. It mimics Jesus miracles from restoring sight to reviving someone to multiplying fish yet people still died while Jesus walked the Earth. In the th book its explained as just a thorn from a thorn bush found in a special place. The nuances of why it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt have been explored in some companion books written by other authors and I dont remember that too well but you can check that out on your own.gtThe constant use of outdated terms which are never explained is ugly and overdoneThat makes it dense Yes. Ive read Borges a lot and some of his stories rely on this method for its setting. Then again I read TBotNS and understood most of the terms with a dictionary then reread it with a better dictionary Lexicon Urthus which clarified a lot of things in the context of the book and presented contrasts to how I pictured these archaically named objects. Thats mostly from The Book of the New Sun. I think it threw so much people off Wolfe decided to avoid it as much as possible in the other series Long Sun Short Sun. At any rate imho it adds a lot and is one of the major themes as some objects are familiar to the MC and some are not. So you share in the MCs cluelessness. Also you can picture them whatever way you like. Other Fantasy authors just make up names. Whats the problem with using Latin roots? The end note of the translator clarifies this choice of words btw and it adds another layer of meaning. I utterly despise any kind of literature that spills everything to the reader because without the authors hand the text would be too difficult. Just imagine Tln Uqbar Orbis Tertius if Borges had added footnotes or explained every single text or object. The connection between author and reader would be entirely different. Whatever. Take it or leave it. Why should it be explained? Most of the terms are magical of fantastical in nature similarly to Vance. gtThe lead character shows no particular signs of intelligenceYou make it sound as if all the stories unfold in the same way. Some times the MC doesnt know what just happens and how he got out of a situation. Sometimes its part of the nature of the world sometimes its due to his nature as the New Son I mean New Sun thats the pun I mentioned earlier as in New Son of God.In part I suspect it has to do with the unreliable narrator thing and what Wolfe tried to achieve for his atmosphere. He is clueless as pertinent to a boy who grew up in a guild and saw nothing of the world. But he is under the thumb of higher powers. This is obvious from the get go so why would you complain about this creative decision? Not that the world shared much of its knowledge with anyone that world doesnt even register where the MC grew up. Its another theme related to the speculative nature of the book. How culture and common sense are not the same. But his PoV transfers this ignorance to the reader like few books achieve. I dont think it subtracts from the story but he is clueless most of the times and bad shit happens because of that. This is quite prevalent in other picaresque stories where the rogues simply get involved in shit and luck shines upon them. In Vances books the wizards pull stuff out of nowhere I invoke this special wand nobody knew of and win by default or stuff resolves without their intervention. I also suspect the dry solemn discourse from Severian is intentional and postfacto trying to make himself sound slightly more refined than he used to be. gtThe entire fourth book feels tacked on and like it doesnt know where it is going or why.I partially agree.gtThe protagonistbecomesking ending doesnt feel the slightest bit logical or earnedIts fiction. Why should it be logical? gtits just there because thats how shitty fantasy series end.Actually thats how this particular fantasy series began. Severian dies at some point and if he wasnt going to become the king then he wouldnt have resurrectedtraveled in timeetc.gtOverall the whole thing is like gtbad gtfanfiction gtfrom someone who gtcopied affectations gtand devices gtleft and right gtbut didnt understand any of what they were copying.Still very opinionated.,Torment,dfi5bv1,3,t5_2s7aw
