Obviously they made the joke ad for his shop and he obviously realised it was a joke sort of thing but it seems like every time that Goorgen has mad an appearance on GMM RampL are making fun of him without him realising.

10763726,0,t1_ddq5yia,I see what youre saying and agree in a way. I want lots of autobiography. I dont mind trivia or advice as long as it doesnt take up a significant part of the book or diract from the autobiographical aspect of it. I definitely hope that the majority of the book will be autobiographical. Itll also be interesting to see how they differentiate between perspectives. Will we be switching between first person Rhett and first person Link? Or will there be a narrator? Theres certainly lots of things to think and ask about but either way I trust Rhett amp Link have something truly amazing up their sleeves with this one.,rhettandlink,ddq75p4,3,t5_2u5cj
