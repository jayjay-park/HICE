3156744,0,t3_2wb55v,Hithat might be quite complicated to be honest. From what I know I might be wrong on this the buses to Girona airport leave from the Estacio del Norte bus station which is on the other side of the city with respect to Camp Nou. You might need  hour to go from the stadium to Estacio del Norte. There will be quite some crowd outside the stadium and therefore it will slow you down. It will also be difficult to get a taxi in any event. Leaving the stadium quite before the end of the game would be an option but that would not be the ideal one.  I check on this page and the only buses this day leave at  or . There might other companies anyway. There might be other companies. For example I found this page  but it does not look very official... EDIT it seems official sorry.  Some other redditor might have a more optimistic opinion I am the kind of guy who like to be quite in advance at the airport. But consider that you would need at least  minutes of public transport from the stadium to the bus station you will have to run through the crowd andor leave the stadium early. Getting a taxi might not be easy but a decent alternative  minutes estimated price  .  EDIT if possible for you flying from Barcelona Prat would be much easier.,Barcelona,cop6zy3,3,t5_2qosg

Definitely stop by this place at least once. Right in the heart of the old city in Plaa St. Jaume.Viena Also great sandwiches. If you go here get the Iberico sin gluten. Its just a simple ham sandwich with tomate on gluten free bread but this ham isnt your boring bologna sandwich in rd grade. This ham is on a whole nother level. Some dude at the NYTimes wrote about the place here. It might feel sort of fast food ish but I promise its fucking great.For a nicer dinner sort of deal check out Pepa Tomate It has a lot of more traditional Catalan dishes as well as just an overall great selection. Those were honestly my  favorite places to eat when I was in BCN. I just looked up where youre staying and its not really near any of them but if youre going to be exploring the city anyways those are in areas with a lot of stuff to be visiting and seeing. Im also celiac and lived in BCN for about  months so if you wife has other questions about phrases or anything feel free to send a message.Edit Just remembered that there are European style crepes made with Buckwheat so gluten free in the big market youll almost certainly go to called La Boqueria as well as on the other side of Plaa Catalunya.

After we were comfortable we loaded everything up and went out to the sea. We went down  meters in depth and we were under water for close to  minutes however that time can vary depending on how fast you consume your air. They fill your tank up to a certain pressure and one you hit the right spot on the gauge then you ascend back to the service. So if you want to stay down as long as possible is definitely a good idea to make sure you breathe very calmly but never home your breath. I should also say the Mediterranean isnt teeming with life like a coral would be. With that being said we did see some eel an octopus fish and quite a few jelly fish. Also please pay the extra  for the photographs. We had another instructor follow us around with a GoPro the whole time. ,Barcelona,csd2y5v,1,t5_2qosg

6061817,0,t3_3ykg48,I made a great itinerary just for you perfect for a oneday trip covering pretty much all the mustsees . AM hit La Rambla for some breakfast and a beer at La Baguetina Catalana . AM Walk or take an Uber to Diagonal Mar where you can soak up some local culture and great architecture and have another beer. . PM time for lunch! Enjoy some of the local specialty paella at any of the Paellador restaurants washed down with a great local beer of course. There are a few in the city just pick one nearby. . PM Shopping and sightseeing! Head on over to Les Glries to do some beerdrinking shopping and peoplewatching. From Diagonal Mar you can take the tram that killed Gaud to get there. . PM Afternoon snack and architecture! No better place to enjoy a coffee or beer haha and pastry than at Las Arenas in Plaza Espaa. While in the neighborhood you can also check out the stunning art deco architecture of the Hotel Catalonia Plaza and just a few blocks away the midcentury design of Estaci de Sants. . PM more sightseeing! Go back and pick up the tram that killed Gaud to take you up Diagonal to lIlla. This stunning structure is even more jawdropping during the holidays when it is decorated like a scene from the first Tron movie. Lots of great cultural activities there. Also beer. . PM time for dinner! We eat late in Barcelona so do as the locals do and head for Fosters Hollywood Have a beer but save room for dessert!. PM catch a live show! No trip to Barcelona would be complete without taking in a live show at the famous Sala Bagdad The area can be a bit sketchy at night but as long as you keep your wits about you you probably wont get mugged only pickpocketed. You can buy beer from the local street vendors there.  . Midnight dancing and beer drinking!

Much easier to blame the radicals fighting back.Peaceful protests yes because that REALLY gets us somewhere..Edit and trashing cars and trash cans is not violence.

8485287,0,t3_4vwqn5,What you could do if youre willing to extend the distance is loop up into the hilltop villages and then back down to the coast. E.g. at El Masnou turn left up into Alella then go to Tei Premi de Dalt Vilassar de Dalt etc... its not a coastal drive per se but you will get better views than down by the beach.IMO the best costal roads here are near Cap de Creus and then north to the French border. We often drive back along the coast after visiting France Collioure Banyuls Cerbre Portbou which is hideous but interesting Colera... then you can opt to turn off for Figueres or take the smaller roads to Port de la Selva and Cadaqus.,Barcelona,d627gjh,3,t5_2qosg

9699486,0,t1_da8m4ht,I agree with you and I would argue there is an explanation. The Catalan and Spanish dilemma is something that is very present in the Spanish consciousness. Its fucking everywhere people are sick of it. On the other hand the thousands of Chinese immigrants have yet not become a part of the collective consciousness in Spain not making it a problem in their minds. Let me be clear I think its fucked up but understanding why is important.

10519991,0,t3_5qg5jq,The biggest problem is that mass tourism of the kind Barcelona has seen has created major stress in the property sector. It doesnt help that it is so reliant on mileuroistas who then cant afford to rent a place. In my opinion the best course would be a big accomodation tax whose proceeds would be used to subsidise rent or pay for social housing. Also a bit of job training that would encourage a bit of dynamism in the labour force. At the moment the benefits of tourism accrue to a small Catalan monied elite with property portfolios and interests in the tourism sector. Its unsustainable and the stuff of revolution in the end. ,Barcelona,dd0jz99,1,t5_2qosg
