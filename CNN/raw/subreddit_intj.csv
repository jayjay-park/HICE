12169,0,t1_cefs3rc,When a relationship ends we tend to quickly forget why it ended and concentrate on the good memories. Every time you notice that you are hurting yourself by thinking of that relationship in a good way try to force yourself to remember the bad times and the reasons why it ended and didnt work out. It takes time but every time you do this you get a bit better and at some point in your life youll be able to think of it in a positive way and move on. I dont really know if it applies to INTJs in general but it is my way of going through rough situations. Always remember that you are at that point in your life for some reasons remember them and move on. You can never change the past nor control the future but a thing is certain if you live in the past your future wont be as bright as youve planned.,intj,ceftj0s,3,t5_2qowo

I can drop two balls of a different weight and see that they land simultaneously. I accept that because that is how it is.

Even if you ignore all the horse stuff which isnt that hard really the main point  the beautiful beautiful main point  remains.  Basically the story is about a character who was cursed that whenever she lost the attention for even a split second of the person she was talking to theyd completely forget everything about her.  So instead of just wallowing in sorrow or abusing people finding someone generous asking for donations rinse repeat she decides to help people from behind the scenes as many INTJs see as their only way of helping.Read it or dont read it but just let the main message bounce around your head for a bit.  Even if you cant get the satisfaction you want by being surrounded by friends and I swear to god if I get a reply saying but NOONE CARES ABOUT ME BUH HUH it feels just as satisfying to know that you made the world a better place.

Now I tend to default to it in almost all irritation situations except the more extreme ones in which I often need some reminders. Take a few long deep breaths. This tends to relieve built up stress and forces you to focus on the present instead of whatever is raging within your mind. If that doesnt help step away and meditate or focus on the breath or clear your mind or whatever you want to call it for  minutes. Essentially a more involved version of . If that doesnt help try to think through what you know about the person and why they may have done whatever irritating they have done.By this point Ive usually eithera realized that whatever it is isnt a big enough deal for me to get worked up about orb come to the understanding that even though this irritating thing seems important to me the other person may not have the same priorities and may not quite understand its effect on me.If its b then its a case where I may decide its important enough to me to communicate my position to that other person which I would do as respectfully as possible. Irritations that make it this far are almost always things at home or work so its not like Im going around telling random friends what irritates me about them. It mostly happens with my wife which is great because communication is of utmost importance in relationships or a coworker which is also great because those irritations are usually related to a perceived inefficiency or misunderstanding that is easily cleared up with a few minutes of discussion.,intj,cfilgk3,2,t5_2qowo

There have been several recent posts about religion and spirituality I figured in this thread paranormal was mean to be more about ghosts telekinesis clairvoyance etc.. All of which simply dont exist. If there was any possibility we would have at the very least strong evidence by now. But not one physical shread of observable scientific evidence have ever been found. There is no one who have ever moved something with their mind in front of scientists no on van talk to the dead anyone who claims to do so or believes you can I suggest you Google James Randi. There is not one single ghost to study. And no I dont buy in to some set of weird rules that dictate you are invisible and can only be contacted at night and can be tracked with a voltage meter. Thats so stupid its depressing.  If I told you I had proof a volcano was going to erupt but I couldnt show it to you cause it can only be observed during the witching hour youd look at me like I was an idiot. All forms of paranormal all of them are simply people choosing to believe something in spite of there being no evidence. A scientist who sets out to prove their own believes is not a scientist at all. Its the job if a scientist to gather data interpret that data and draw reasonable conclusions that can be tested independently by other scientists. Every one who claims to investigate the paranormal any form of it does so to confirm something that they want to believe regardless of evidence. Thoes stupid ghost hunters on TV have been to dozens of locations and yet no proof. So if they investigate every house in America and cant find proof that theres ghosts will they say they failed and theres no such thing no theyll say that they just havent found it yet.

437299,0,t3_1z1xlg,Im in my late forties. I live alone not because I cant find a relationship but because I value quiet and serenity more than companionship and drama. If I could find someone who could respect my needs for alone time Id happily reenter a relationship. Sadly the women Ive dated claim they understand but rarely actually do.My depression and anxiety got bad enough that I was put on a disability pension. Money is tight but thats fine you learn to do without the things you dont really need and concentrate on those you do.Most of my days are quiet and peaceful although my family still occasionally manages to force drama on me. But for the most part Im comfortable warm fed and content.I have a few friends I see occasionally usually I get together with someone once a week for half a day or so. Its something to look forward to and it fulfills my needs for companionship without overloading.I study some aspects of Buddhism especially the bits on attachment vs. love which helps me a great deal. Im always working on some aspect of my personality that I want to change. For example it took me more than  years to correct my road ragedangerous driving bad habit. Currently Im working on my anger issues as well as trying to be less judgmental.Things could be better but they have been much worse in the past so generally I am content. Just as long as I am left alone.,intj,cfq3aj4,6,t5_2qowo

468193,0,t1_cftfvl8,I dont have a huge problem with Harry Potter even though it is fairly vanilla and uninspired.  The problem I have is that nothing breeds imitation like success.  Harry Potter by its very success has created a slew of imitators.  Hollywood in their infinite laziness has attempted to cash in on this and pump out more of the same material with various degrees of success.  This in turn has an effect on the books and movies that will be considered for publishingfilming.  A lot of more worthy original and interesting works are passed over because they wont be profitable.Finally because of Harry Potters popularity.  The standards for what is considered literature or suitable reading material for adults has dropped.  I expect that it will continue to drop as people have less time to read or digest more complex thoughts.

Being someone who is almost always rational it was an entirely new feeling of fear and confusion. I ended up taking myself to an emergency room and after about  hours after they put me in a quiet room I calmed down. I had to isolate and just stare at a blank wall and stop thinking.INTJ and anxiety really do not mix well together. Anxiety causes our overactive internal monologue spits out things that we dont understand and that alone is unsettling. The two options I would say you should look into are finding a local crisis support center or talk to your doctor about possible anxiety meds. Anxiety meds for me were scary I took one and the world went blank and Ive never taken another. I just take more focus on actually finding a quiet activity to relieve stress.

Reading your post felt like I was reading something written by future me living in an alternate universe. One thing I would suggest is looking into companies that use computing to help people. I went to a few STEM career fairs and there seemed to be several companies looking for coders to do work in the medical field designing programs and processes to help people live a better life. I was always crap at coding so I never looked into them so much but I know theyre out there. Also if youd be into it you could look into some sort of religion. Im Mormon and I love it but I know that Buddhism is one that a lot of people find solace in without  believing in some higher power. It seems to be a very humancentric selfimprovement dominated peaceful religion that helps a lot of people even if they just practice for the meditation without all the reincarnation and such.

But there are a few things I would say to you that may help brighten your perspective.Ive always told myself you cant control what happens to you or what people care about in this specific case but you CAN control how you react to it. Ive been ostrasized my whole life because Im different and think differently than others. Ive attempted to assimilate to others methods of thinking and concern but I was really just hiding my true self. Which brings me to my next point.You are who you are. Why try and change it and why get upset when everyone else isnt quite like you? People complain whether its hot or its cold. They complain when they stand out and when they blend it. So stop complaining and deal with who you are. And dont give up because things didnt turn out as you expected. Be proud to be different and find what really makes you happy. If you want to find other people to share your hobbies with then its gonna be tough to find people who are exactly like you. But if you give up then it will be impossible.I guess in short Im just encouraging you to look on the brighter side of life. You cant change other people but you can change your perception of your own life and self worth! ,intj,cg01401,2,t5_2qowo

Unfortunately I cant really give much advice as all previous relationships have ended. It wasnt specifically due to that mind you. There were lies or life changes or all manner of reasons behind each of them. What I can say is that I generally have nonmonogamous relationships and that helps me not feel confined. I generally dont pursue anyone specifically in a sexual manner but I am free to have chats with new people and get all weird and tangled up about them and then usually find out theyre not all I thought they were. My partners is then able to call me out if I am getting weird or neglectful of our relationship as well. Mind you I am not specifically advocating nonmonogamy. Thats a tough road if your head isnt wrapped around it. What I would say Ive learned from my situation that can be applied in monogamous ones is that open communication with my partner is pretty important. I cant go long thinking in a bubble or I start to build up this world that might not even exist and I need their input to see whether or not it does.

Obviously I cant speak to the business school experience but Ill echo the comment elsewhere about it being possible to make a big school seem small but not a small school seem big. Its a little like choosing between living in a large city or a small town maybe the culture of the small town will suit you or maybe it wont. But in a large place you can FIND the culture youre looking for because I guarantee it exists there somewhere. Hell I go to a school in the southern US and dont fit in with the mainstream culture AT ALL but Ive still found a pretty sizable friend group of likeminded people. Plus the resources and opportunities youll receive at a large school are in general better. So Ive found it overall to be a good experience.Honestly Ive found that as an introvert its a lot easier to feel alone in a large crowd of people you dont know that a small crowd of people you do. So I wouldnt get too worried about being overloaded with social interaction. Sure that may be pushed as the ideal at a large university but there are enough people that you can do whatever the hell you want and never have to answer to anyone for it. You can be as social or not as you want.tldr Personally I can think of a lot of upsides of a large student body but really very few downsides. So I wouldnt get too concerned.,intj,cgmviye,6,t5_2qowo

But does that imply fundamental incompatibility? No not necessarily. There is no such thing as the perfect personmaterelationship statistically I want to believe it since there are so many people in the world. But that person doesnt exist or youll never meet them. The reality of the matter is this  finding someone to be with in a longterm romantic relationship is mostly about luck and compromise.

As with any forum there are extremists on both ends of the spectrum MRAs and Feminists alike. Hell there was a book written by a Feminist called the S.C.U.M Manifesto S.C.U.M stood for Society for Cutting Up Men.That is crazy and extreme and does not represent the the majority in the Feminist movement at the time.If you want to cherry pick random posts to try and shore up your superiority complex go right ahead. Or maybe you could actually try to understand the issues men go through and maybe see that it was a cry for help that had been going on for years and only now on the Internet where theyre free to speak their minds can they start to figure this out rather than being shut down by thought police like you.Heres an idea why dont you start your own sub giving out advice? A lot of young men have lost their way grown up without fathers and are just generally confused about a lot of things masculine. Build a better product and they will come.You can bitch all you like how wrong the views are but it doesnt stop the fact that people are looking for answers and will turn to the first source that seems to give them those answers. And to be honest a lot of those answers are just basic self help stuff increasing your confidence looking after yourself setting goals.

870969,0,t1_ch39iow,I strongly disagree with the first paragraph here.  The Bean series is intended to be read after the Ender series and is better that way.  Enders Shadow particularly suffers if you read it immediately after Enders Game rather than coming back to it and its quite possibly my favourite.  Plus Speaker for the Dead is the favourite book of a LOT of adults.   I suggest reading Enders Game then Speaker for the Dead and then starting into Xenocide. Xenocide and Children of the Mind become much more philosophical books and some people like that while others dont. So see what you think of Xenocide. If partway through youre just not into it go ahead and stop and dont bother reading Children. Move on.  But you should read whatever amount of the Ender books you end up wanting to read and THEN go on to Enders Shadow which with a bit of space is awesome and continue into its sequels.  All additional books short stories and all are better read after the  core books or whatever portion of them you decided to read.  Some people have turned them around and read them in inseries chronological order but the books are definitely not written to be read that way and youll miss out on things for doing it.  Writing order is by far the best.  I too love Madeleine LEngles books but both people Ive recommended them to who only read them as adults just didnt get into them.  ,intj,ch3a7rm,1,t5_2qowo

It was a surreal experience. Finding supplies was difficult and not dying was even harder. I eventually found a hunting rifle and decided to set up an ambush and steal another players supplies. I did so found a good route between two major points and sure enough after about half an hour of waiting a lone survivor appears at the edge of the wood line on the opposite side of the field I was watching it is common practice not to go into a field because youre easy to see so he was evaluating his options. Well he evaluated too long and I fired one shot. Sure enough it hit him and he bled out by the time I got there. He had maybe a couple cans of beans and a water bottle a crappy pistol and a shotgunvarious medical supplies. Useful but nothing I couldnt have found easily enough on my own. For the first time though I felt guilt from playing a game. I murdered someone who didnt pose a threat to me so I could steal his things that he may have spent days trying to find.Needless to say I only ever shot confirmed bandits after that point and made it my goal to hunt them.

I like talking with my sisters because their brain tends to move in the same direction as mine so its ok to skip a bunch of steps.And I feel like a big dumb too!!

1200426,0,t3_27tt8i,I was happy single for a good while. Then I met someone I like more than I liked being single. We wound up together. In the context of a longterm romantic relationship I believe in marriage the social custom in which people make commitments to each other in the presence of whoever matters to them particularly before any other such commitments like joint finances cohabitation children or other such big commitments.  Note that it is the commitment I see as the intrinsic part of marriage not the fact that you send in paperwork to notify the government after the fact.  If I hadnt met the person I met I would probably still be happily single today. And that would have been a just fine outcome as well happy as I am with this one.  I dont believe in single paths.  I worked with children for many years and go back and forth on whether I really like them or just happen to be good with them.  But I have always known I didnt want any of my own. Its simply a desire or urge that I do not feel at all. And I believe children deserve to be madly wanted by both parents.  And particularly when I did work regularly with children leaving them at the end of the day to return to my quiet home that was free of children was an absolute must. I enjoy my childfree life and will continue to do so.  As for general I think whatever works for any consenting adults is up to the consenting adults in question.  But if you are going to bring into the picture someone who is not a consenting adult like say a child then you owe it to that person to do the best you possibly can to set up a good base for them  and one of those prereqs is being in a stable relationship with your coparent.  Whether you want to formalize it or not is up to you. But if the commitment isnt there dont tie yourselves together for the rest of your life with a child.,intj,ci4nzuw,8,t5_2qowo

I dont think problem is the right word but the outcome is unexpected. Anyway with FiSe well experience something but NiTe being dominant and auxiliary respectively were going to process it rationally first. We dont really experience the emotion until after the fact. For example you just get out of an argument with a coworker. During the argument you might have been a little intense but not really mad or anything. Its usually until after the argument when youll think Wow what he said actually really pissed me off. WOW I CANT BELIEVE HE SAID THAT.

1385417,0,t1_cipwh8g,gtI take it you dislike it because it makes it more complex than it has to be?Correct. Its the sort of literary posing that academics of his era were infamous for and which has fortunately died down somewhat though it is still strong on the theory side of the softer sciences gender theory and the like. The dearth of precise claims is hidden underneath a thick layer of abstract metaphor. Its designed to make the author seem wiser and his arguments more profound than they actually are.For examplegtAlthough the intuitive type has little inclination to make a moral problem of perception since a strengthening of the judging functions is required for this only a slight differentiation of judgment is sufficient to shift intuitive perception from the purely aesthetic into the moral sphere. A variety of this type is thus produced which differs essentially from the aesthetic although it is none the less characteristic of the introverted intuitive. The moral problem arises when the intuitive tries to relate himself to his vision when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its aesthetic configuration and evaluation when he confronts the questions What does this mean for me or the world? What emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or a task for me or the world? The pure intuitive who represses his judgment or whose judgment is held in thrall by his perceptive faculties never faces this question squarely since his only problem is the knowhow of perception. He finds the moral problem unintelligible or even absurd and as far as possible forbids his thoughts to dwell on the disconcerting vision.Translation Intuitive types can get lost inside of their own perception since actualizing their vision would require the development of the judging functions. Pure intuitives have little desire to attempt the development of judgment seeing the knowhow of actualizing their perception as tied to the moral question of how one should relate to the world and of ones duties to the world a question that unsettles aestheticallyoriented intuitives and leads them to repress their judgement or to subjugate it to their perception.Jung is by no means the only thearly th century writer to use pretentious prose like this but hes definitely worse than many of his peers.,intj,cipy0hd,2,t5_2qowo

My relationship with my son and wife are most important with other family friends and coworkers in descending order of value. How do your relationships seem to develop?It really depends on the context here this isnt an easy question to answer as it depends on the type of relationship and the circumstances.  Ive had many different types of relationships develop in a multitude of ways.  Sometimes  I initiated conversation and at others the other person did.     How are you in the whole SO department? Family? Friends?Im married with one child.  I get along mostly OK with family though there is some tension with my parents.  I dont really have any friends at the moment outside of pen pals. What role doesdoesnt empathy play in your dealings with others?I try to approach things in a rational yet empathetic way with mixed results.

Its common for INTJs to have an odd relatioship with death. Odd being that we accept it. We know its coming so why make a big deal out of it?Your grandfather has lived a long long life and you think that theres no point in extending his life especially if its going to cause him pain. This is very logical but your family on the other hand is only thinking about their feelings and how they will feel after hes gone whereas you are objectively looking at the situation and how your grandfather is doing instead of getting emotionally invested.

1544425,0,t3_2brtz9,Story The first time I actively realised that I was visualizing things moments objects feelings situations was when I was about . I sat in the living room and was a little bored. I started spacing out for a moment and everything seemed to shrink. Like you were watching through binoculars backwards. I was very surprised that I could do that and started to think if I could imagine things that were not there already and manipulate them but I got distracted and lost my train of thought. Later that day I was laying in bed bored again. Did not really want to sleep but was tired. My thoughts were circuling about what would happen in my mind when I fell asleep wich effectively kept me from sleeping. To brake out of it I thought why not try to space out again and visualize something. My reasoning was that it would keep my mind distracted from looping arround the same thought over and over again. First thing I imagined a cube with flat sides like it was drawn in paint but it was spinning in D this did not however keep me from thinking about what I would think about when I fell asleep so I was looking for a more complex gemetric figure. We had learned in school something about angles and that round objects just have tons of tiny corners I dont really remember what we learned but i twas something along those lines so I forged the the cube into a sphere and the sphere into a raindrom mid fall wobbling arround at first seeing a lot of small corners and with time it became rounder and rounder. So I had this blue raindrop spinning in front of a black background in all its glory and I fell asleep.Sounds pretty boring when I write it down but it was magnificent. I used this technique of imgining gemoetric objects effectively to fall asleep for about two years.Nowerdays my visuals are a lot more complex and often directed like movies that I had seen or that I would like to see. This however can be very distracting. At Uni sitting in lectures I often space out and think about other things or about stuff that I had just learned and would visualize it. It is very distracting because I have not found a method to deactivate it or stop myself from doing it and I sometimes miss several minutes of a lecture. I am at a point now where I can imagine situations so lifelike that I am can for example get adrenaline rushes when thinking about exitingly dangerous things or get sad when thinking about others.,intj,cj9v8d9,2,t5_2qowo

There is something so innate about jealosy the need to preserve the atenttion and fidelity of your partner amidst the impending threat of a potential mate that shows interest in the partner. Personally I live in a constant search for excitement and sensations since it is hard for me to feel exhilarated and jealousy is one of the strongest sensations I have experienced. In my own experience the rush of gut discomfort and the imagery of my partner engaging in romantic or sexual rituals with someone else is completely infuriating the trick is staying cool with the situation. Keep a solid rationale. Shehe is in hisher rights to engage in whatever activities heshe desires and I am grateful for any heshe decides to share with me. I have absolutely no say in what they can or cannot do.Now when the immediate threat is gone and I can be intimate with my partner I feel grateful and honored for the priviledge Ive been granted and that discomfort that I was feeling before suddenlt transforms into a desire of making her feel as MUCH as I can in order to reinforce her feelings towards me and to preserve them.

1874457,0,t1_ckf13gy,I have been questioning myself quite a lot lately after having two really close friends cut me out of their lives after a long road trip. I went on the trip find myself and help out my friend going through some tough family issues and his girlfriend. I cared about them more than they cared about me I guess and when we got back I found out my friend had been lying about a lot of things he did while we were on the trip. When confronted he continued to lie to cover up his lies and was generally extremely manipulative. He refused to talk about it in person and further refused to even talk after that. So I lost two friends. The last I saw of them was in the back lot of a store extremely intoxicated and I gave them a ride to their house. I should have known it would happen considering what they do to their families. I think I get attached and empathise way to much with very confusing and emotionally draining people I am not sure why. Help resolve conflict as much as possible by working with the issues till thier resolved. No one likes that I guess. I am very passive never yell or get angry. Try my best to solve conflict without more conflict and try to talk it out. Never seems to work though so instead lately I have been recognizing problems and just keeping them to myself and internalizing them rather then bring them up I guess.,intj,ckf2d3c,1,t5_2qowo

Had it been the other way and I was talking to someone who was acting like I did I would have just kept walking and called him a dick.  In later years people know me as the listener.  I will listen to everything to have to say whether you need to vent or are excited to talk about something.  This allows me to be an an awesome position they tell stuff to me and I get to be sociable without putting the effort forward about having to find a topic.  I let people talk and talk to me and if I have an opinion I toss it in if it is sensitive I ask if they mind if I put my opinion in.  I give decent enough advice about general conversations or problems.  Some other people see my as a wealth of knowledge for my specific trade and ask me questions on what I do and how to do it. If i had to guess why people come back to me I would say as of now they will get someone who lets them have the conversation when they want to control it takes control when they dont want it and debates when necessary.

We may have altered that nature but its still there.And while its one thing to cut chickens wings so they dont fly away and keep them in a closed enviroment for the purpose of getting eggs feathers and meat its another thing to keep a cat inside all day when its used to enjoy the hunt outsider. same goes for instance for holding sledge dogs that get depressed and agressive when they dont get their time of running each day.

To maximize outcomes especially for the socalled knowledge workers it is ideal to have hone in on a specialization but to also keep an eye on the world at large especially in fields that are connected to but not obviously affected by ones specialization. This is how innovation happens someone with both a micro and macro focus first develops a deep knowledge base of their particular field and then extrapolate this out to related topics of interest to make connections that are new and useful.

Social awkwardness to wipe the smug smiles off their stupid smug faces. Loneliness to make their laughter ring hollow. Fear of failure to undermine each and every plot. And finally perhaps most devastatingly she cursed them to never find love. The timing would always be wrong the people never quite right the circumstances never conducive. She sent all of these masterminds to another world where they would not remember who they had been their previous confident and happy selves and would be deluded into believing that the world was too real too cruel too impossible for dreams and magic. In this mirror world the INTJs lived their lives. Lives devoid of laughter and love and confidence. Each of them felt a peculiar homesickness for a place they had never known a place they couldnt even name. A curse is only a curse if youre unhappy.

2032734,0,t3_2i18p5,Heres a few Western European nations enjoy higher living standards and cheaper healthcare largely because they enjoy the protection of the US military and high pharmaceutical spending in the US pays for a disproportionate amount of drug development costs. Putin actually wants his empire back.  This isnt about maintaining a balance of power or some buffer zone.  The guy is  years old and knows hes running out of time to actually make moves like this and likely doesnt have much faith in his successors to be able do the same thing.  By stating NATO wont intervene and not giving real military or arms support to the Ukraine were essentially ensuring that theyll lose this war and practicing the same policy of appeasement that led to further aggression in WW. Big complex issues like climate change are difficult to solve because we honestly dont have the technology yet to do it in an economically sensible way.  If it was really profitable to put solar panels on everything Wall Street would be the first one in line to make money off doing so.  We should be investing more in research and less into subsidizing the existing green energy industry.  Nuclear is the only technology that could solve all of these problems today but misguided antiproliferation regulation and NIMBYism has largely removed it as a politically viable option. President Obama was too hasty in withdrawing US forces from Iraq.  Theres a good argument to be made that ISIS wouldnt have grown to be such a large problem if the US had the troops in place to have stomped them out before they started taking over large swathes of territory. College isnt for everyone.  High tuition prices and waning public subsidies are partially a result of that.  Basically you cant guarantee the same return on public money if a substantial part of the college population is underachieving or dropping out.  Most people should be getting education in trades and general business practices. The post WW boom from the  to the s was more the result of declining competition from ideologically polarized world and half of Europe being bombed to crap than it was tax rates or public policy in the US. The most effective form of information isnt hiding things from the general public or preying on their fears.  Its confirming their existing biases and worldview while vilifying whoever disagrees with them.  Information is widely available and the only reason are ignorant of anything is because they dont really want to look that hard to find out the truth. Regulated capitalism works largely because it channels the greedy and competitive portions of humanity into something productive while putting some kind of boundaries on it.

2037348,0,t3_2i3rcf,Im with you OP. Its not a popular opinion I think theres something universal about the psychology of music but ultimately its pretty accurate. What is music but noises strung together into a specific deliberate pattern? Nothing. Thats all music is. The reason why people have a response to music is the same reason people have a response to paintings or poetry  the phenomenon of having psychological associations prompted by external stimulus. If you take that logic to its extreme no form of artistic expression music theater paintings etc. has any point. Fundamentally its all pointless. Id agree with that position but I also think the world would be less interesting and colorful in the absence of artistic expression. So I accept that artistic expression is ultimately pointless but nevertheless enjoyable. Of course thats not a romantic idea so people will try to refute it. Thats why you hear people say things like music is a universal language or things to that effect. People want to believe that music is something more than what it is. But it isnt. Music isnt a global language. To the untrained ear Chinese opera sounds like cats getting slowly raped to death. Nothing about that operatic story could be communicated through the music alone  cultural literacy and linguistic familiarity are necessary to understanding the music. Without that understanding the music becomes what I said all music fundamentally is  noises strung together into a specific and deliberate pattern.Edit I say this as someone who enjoys playing guitar. I dont need music to have some kind of grand universal point to enjoy it but Im likewise not going to pretend music is something more than what it is. ,intj,ckysixw,2,t5_2qowo

People can still do good things and bad things but its not a matter of them being a good or bad person  its a matter of whether they can see far enough in the future and delay immediate gratification for even better feelings down the road. Pretty much the same as working out and eating right vs. sitting on the couch and eating nachos every day.When you look at it this way there are essentially two ways to be happy but only one is sustainable.

Layman question though arent the majority of urban planning jobs in the public sector? That sounds absolutely miserable to me. The opposite of what an INTJ would enjoy.One of my best friends is an accountant and based on what hes told me... if you want to enjoy your career its a poor choice. If you want a paycheck its a good choice. Supposedly accounting is miserable for everyone going to school for it which isnt surprising to me.Still I was actually in your predicament when I was in school. I thought that if I was going to go to school for anything it ought to be psychology since it was the most interesting subject to me. Still I couldnt see myself really doing psychology... or anything related to it. In the end I simply stopped going to college. Its completely possible to pick it up later when debt is less of a concern.Depending on where youre located there are so many options out there that are often overlooked. My first job was a paid internship with a small political thinktankjournal thing and my second was a tradepay with a local CSA farm. I used discretionary incomefrom not paying for school to attend classes that taught me the skills I simply... wanted. Like childcare construction mechanics bike building and repair. This sets you up to take small jobs that you actually enjoy and eventually you can add this to your resume. The wide variety of experience is generally very attractive to small businesses if thats your poison. Or you could simply start your own.Ultimately my interest in college has always been for the experience itself. I like the environment and I like being around smart people. So many people treat college like the oneandonly tool for getting a job but thats simply not true. ,intj,clb7r69,2,t5_2qowo

2179274,0,t3_2k0p78,I love cooking. Honestly it doesnt take much education and practice to make food on par with a gourmet restaurant especially for your everyday meatandpotatoes kinda meal. For the most part all it takes is fresh ingredients seasonings and the will to try. Not to mention that cooking is cheaper than eating out at restaurants. The rule of thumb for restaurants if I understand correctly is that the price on the menu should be x higher than the cost of ingredients used to make the dish. But cooking can be very labor intensive and most days Id like to simply eatrest after work than spend an hour or two prepping cooking and cleaning for  minutes of actual eating. So I do INTJ things like cooking in batches and eating the same dinner every night for a week. Buying saucesbrothsbases at the grocery store and adding extra seasonings so it doesnt taste so bland. I also have a small cache of recipes that use ingredients Im likely to already have provide good nutrition use a minimum of potspans to make and dont take long to cook. ,intj,clgu78o,20,t5_2qowo

2261130,0,t1_clqsoob,gt Most people that I know make decisions entirely based on a long term strategy.The problem with this is that at what point do you stop making decisions based on your future self and start making decisions for your present self? You should strive to find a balance between the two I think. gt You cannot be successful unless you prepare but you also cannot gain the knowledge required in order to prepare without doing it successfully and then replicating the process.I understand youve been trained to think this way but you dont need to be successful at everything you do especially the first time you do it. Failure is an integral part of the learning process for so so many things. Think of a sport you can study the mechanics of what it takes to hit a baseball all you want but you are still going to suck at it the first time you do it. And thats perfectly acceptable.So I would take issue with your conditional logic here... trying and failing is a necessary part of preparation for many things. Theres just no way around it and so to be afraid or otherwise avoid failure is only going to limit your options. gt How many stories of doing stupid things while drunk can one person have? How many times will one complain about problems before one fixes them? What am I missing here?Im not going to try and convince you that people who talk excessively about these things are going to be great interesting people. But I just get the feeling that you are overgeneralizing. When I was in University I met a bunch of people who were interested in deeper subjects and I dont see why you couldnt either. I can totally agree that small talk is pretty boring and mundane but it is simply the social norm that serves to allow people to get a feel for each other. I would suggest that you dont dismiss people because they talk about some boring stuff at first thats what people are trained to do. They may be a lot more interesting and deep than they seem.gt I have so far attempted to compensate for any social shortcomings through greater knowledge and limiting the scope of social interaction. My issue is more figuring out how social interaction works outside an academic environment.The thing is that social knowledge is going to require actual experience trial and error as you mentioned. If you want to figure it out you need to experience it. I would suggest joining some clubs that arent focused solely on academics. What you need to do and what I did when I was at my most socially anxious is to just completely resign yourself to the fact that you are not going to be good at it all the time. Youre gonna mess up youre going to find yourself in awkward situations. Just be cognizant of it when its happening and realize that despite what it feels like you are actually learning and growing. Its a good thing to fail. You will learn what works and what doesnt and like any kind of knowledge social knowledge will eventually allow you to get a lot more out of your subject other people than would otherwise be capable without this knowledge. Anyways good luck man. You have an awesome ability to be receptive and reasonable and I have no doubt you can improve at it if you put some effort in. ,intj,clr72ey,1,t5_2qowo

I see no reason to think that any of them are true.You claim that people join groups to escape thought yet that to think is to be human and to emote is to be animal. I have some objections to this. Primarily one of the biggest things that sets humans apart form other animals is how much more social we are. Imagine if humanity were the best it could be.

2508334,0,t1_cmlpwx9,Love your neighbor as yourself appears directly in Leviticus and is quoted verbatim by Christ as summing up the law and the prophets along with the commandment to love God with all ones heartsoulmind. Luke  which directly parallels situations where Christ quotes the golden rule uses the version I quoted instead of the more common formulation. Note that here its another person addressing Christ and in doing so hes referencing Jewish thought that had summarized the Torah into the two commandments quoted.I cant give any more detail on the Jewish perspective than that other than to say that the Talmud echoes the sentiment that the golden rule is the whole of the law and that everything else is explaining how to fulfill it including the direct command to love ones neighbor as himself and the numerous subtle variations on the golden rule itself indicate that it must be read with far more nuance than most of the people in this thread are doing if you want to be giving it the appropriate JudeoChristian context. However in addition to Christs words in the gospels Paul repeats this understanding in Galatians almost word for word For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command Love your neighbor as yourself. Thus both Christ and Paul agreed that this formulation as well as the golden rule sum up the law implying a degree of interchangeability and it seems clear that they were at least acknowledging similar thought patterns in existing Jewish theology though obviously Christianity holds that Christs teaching on the matter brought a new context.,intj,cmlz6zt,1,t5_2qowo

2526764,0,t3_2oejej,From the video the cop let his adrenaline get the best of him and didnt show proper discretion when the man said he couldnt breathe. I would understand if he were the only officer there but there were several others so if you did release the hold and he got aggressive again theres enough manpower to get the situation back under control.This should have gone to trail at least. There is a case for a manslaughter charge from what I have seen and read.I do not buy into the hyperbole on either side. I hate and I mean despise the thin blue line mentality where cops defend each other even if one of their colleagues is clearly in the wrong. But I also hate the other side where narrative trumps the facts.This is a nonviolent crime though and never ever should have turned into a physical confrontation.

And what I mean by that is its fun to see if it holds true or not. I approach it like a science experiment. Here is a theory lets try it out and see if its true. So far my results have been inconclusive so I dont put much stock in it but I am open to it being true if it were proven. So many people seem to dismiss it outright without another thought. And vehemently and with prejudice. Same with anything remotely supernatural and I know its another can of worms but supernatural things are vastly understudied by scientists because of this social stigma. Its really an area that needs MORE study to either find what we can come up with or put it to bed definitively. Sorry wow tangent.I also like divination with runes and tarot.

2682620,0,t3_2qqr86,Your wedding should be the way you and your husband want it.  Your immediate family should be able to watch the ceremony if you love them and care about them and if theyd be hurt not being invited. Anything that you think should be done because of tradition but that you dont want to do should be ignored.  If youre not close with your family or if you think they may cause problems getting eloped is totally cool.My wedding only consisted of me my husband immediate family and a handful of cousins and family friends.  We didnt even have  people attend.  We got married on a cliff overlooking the ocean had lunch in a small dining room of an inn and went on a short boat ride.  We had a first dance but no dancing for guests.  I didnt have a bachelorette party I didnt have a diamond engagement ring and I didnt have a fatherdaughter dance.  My family loved the ceremonyreception but if I could change anything I would have made it even smaller with only immediate family and no cousins or friends.  My parents pressured me into inviting their favorite niecesnephews and one set of their best friends and I really wish none of those people were there.

2720633,0,t3_2r7mhm,Wow the soccer thing. I had long hair in braids and I would suck on my braids and pick flowers in the field. I didnt like soccer much but my brothers and a few friends did it so I did it so I wouldnt feel left out. I was much more extroverted than I am now although I was still an introvert. Most friends didnt know that I was an introvert. I tagged along with my two older brothers in everything and it took a lot of time to foster independent confidence away from my family and what was familiar. I sang and laughed loudly and my family would probably say I was a kind good kid though I was just a little spoiled since I was the only girl. Edit as a point of interest my husbandINTJ and I have a toddler who is far too young to solidly type. Ive often wondered where she will land on the mbti because neither of my parents or my husbands parents werequietly. She naturally wants to mimic our behavior at her age so shell flip through her books while were reading if were watching something on the couch shell want to snuggle etc.Ive noticed that although she loves our attention and the attention of guests she also has selfestablished a period of quiet private play for herself. She may spend most of the day playing with a big bouncy ball giggling being tossed around by my husband or me and shell love that play. But at some point each day she goes to her room closes her door and plays quietly. She usually flips through story books or plays with stuffed animals. I think its little distinctions like that which indicate to me that she may be an introvert though she loves playing with others and Ive taught myself not to interrupt her during that time. She also seems to understand when I tell her I need some private quiet time like her quiet playtime. I think that was the most surprising observation. After I explained to her that I needed my own quiet time she said okay and went to her room shut the door and played quietly for a half hour or so. ,intj,cndboo0,2,t5_2qowo

2892787,0,t1_cnvsywb,Whether or not you believe God has a plan for you just understand that either way life is still a journey that youre only just starting.  My advice is to accept what your mind and heart tell you but keep it open at all times.  If you find you dont believe in God embrace the fact that you dont have all the answers and keep open the possibility you might be wrong.  Likewise if you do accept God into your life keep living life with the understanding that you and only you control the circumstances of tomorrow and only you can make things happen in your life not God or anyone else.   Theres two many people on both sides of that spectrum who have become completely closed minded like naively believing they have it all figured out.  Close minded people are frowned up in culture food and entertainment yet we tolerate it so much when it comes to these types of discussions. Anyway this topic comes up over and over and I responded to this once.  Here was my take as a believer just to throw my hat in the mix. gtIm Catholic albeit not a churchgoing one. I still believe in the general premise of it all though.gtIn terms of how that reconciles with being an INTJ my logic is that theres too much we dont understand and I suspect much more that we as humans cant even comprehend to act like we know how things came to existence. If animals can only comprehend up to a certain point Ive reasoned that human comprehension is most definitely limited as well... and we dont know what we dont know so we automatically assume what we know is all there is to know if that makes sense.  gtWhen I look up at the sky and try to imagine how vast this universe really is or look into a random crowd of people and realize every one of those people have a story it just blows my mind. I believe in a higher power because I simply cant comprehend the complexity of our world.gtTheres also anecdotal things Ive observed or people whom Im close to have observed that contribute to my belief that there is more than we know but thats a whole discussion in itself,intj,cnwwwmt,2,t5_2qowo

This would be similar to our eyes compensating for a bad sense of smell. The benefits of rational thought are that you can make decisions in a traceable manner. There is value to that.

2960812,0,t3_2u2apu,Ive done it once. It was really fun and interesting. I flew and my brain replaced free fall with the sensation of being on a rollercoaster. I tried to have sex but then I woke up... Dammit. The thing was you had to stay calm when you realized you were dreaming. This is usually when you wake up. Staying calm and looking for signs of dreaming. I used two signs that I had read about. Firstly I looked at my clock. The time span around uncontrollably. Secondly I looked at my fingers at first they looked normal but then they sort of melted together. Very bizarre. After I realized I was dreaming I could control it a lot more. I could not control the scenery that changed a bit at random. But you have to do a lot of things to get aware of your surroundings. Every time you wake up you need to write down what you dreamy about because you forget that within minutes. Throughout the day you need to do reality checks and stuff. I mostly wrote down my dreams when I wake up. Which in turn made me remember more cool dreams and then one night I was aware I was dreaming. ,intj,co4npz9,2,t5_2qowo

Maybe try watching one episode a night when you both first get home from work. That way you guys can be together and he can still get some recharge time.

Since I never broach or moderate the topic they must have felt like they had to come out with strong hyperbole in order to make me take them seriously.gt I guess brings me back around to our different goals in our relationships.Ive tried quite a few ways to bring my relationships to a healthy result.  With only one exception the rule has been that the more Ive wanted from a relationship the less Ive gotten out of it.When I was very young I reasoned that I would never get married because I didnt believe there was a woman out there who could make me happy.Over a decade later I wish I had listened to myself.  I spent a long long time and immeasurable effort trying to get a normal slice of life in relationships.  Once I tricked myself into thinking this was as close as I would get to that idea I married and was divorced before my twoyear anniversary.After that point I reasoned that I was naive to believe that just because a woman wanted to make me happy didnt mean that she could.  And darker still just because a woman can make me happy doesnt mean she is willing.Ultimately I dont have real goals in my relationships anymore.  I used to think relationships could be something special something amazing and that I would be really good at them.  And to be fair to myself I have come very far along without very serious mistakes women find me incredibly charming and witty  I get eyes more than I ever used to.  However that knowledge came at quite a price I no longer have any optimism whatsoever for my romantic relationships.Vexingly they have been more satisfying this way at least for me.  Regrettably women who find me this way end up falling for me.So without intending it women are nothing more than entertainment to me.  Although I still get jealous of how much they truly are excited to see me to be with me to learn from me.

But the more I thought about being a sniper in the marines or a ninja or a super hero... I just felt it was all so far away. And actually worthless. Like even as a kid I could feel the huge daunting questions of life. I didnt know them explicitly but I was dealing with the biggest questions that could be asked. Death seemed like the one and only most interesting thing a person could do. All of life is... Life. So judging one part to the other is biased and ignorant we only know this life. What is reality? A dream is reality until you wake up. So what is this reality? I felt that dying would be the most meaningful thing Id ever do. So it is not that I am depressed or scared that makes me think of death but its exciting. What could death be? And I think you probably just cease to exist I am not religious. But still. The quote by... That guy if I am death is not if death is I am not. That sums up my thoughts. If I die then all of life is not. For all I can think death is the only true mystery.

3143935,0,t1_conr8ct,Im anticipating living with my cactus and telling kids to get off my lawn. I hate kids now and I intend to keep doing it but then again they dont go on my lawn and I dont own a cactus so I suppose Ill become a worse person because Ill be financially stimulating the cactus industry which uses underpaid foreign workers. Not to mention the fact that by keeping kids off my lawn theyll never be talk to me about my cactus and by extension no one will ever ask about the economic impact which that cactus is having internationally. Cacti like the Opuntia ficusindica or prickly pears are grown in enormous amounts primarily in Mexico using workers who are severely underpaid. Barbary figs the fruit of the prickly pear cactus actually make up . of Mexican large scale agricultural in an analysis of  hectares of land used for fruit production. In comparison to other fruits cactus pears are very expensive to produce due to the fact that the low demand for them makes them a risky fruit to produce to begin with and the fact that dethorning the prickly pears is not a pleasant job so to keep workers prickly pear producers tend to pay them more highly in comparison to say a banana. Given the risk of not having buyers for the prickly pears and the comparitively high cost of production for them very little money is actually put into the safety of prickly pear workers and the inspection standards are nowhere near as highquality as those held by high demand fruits such as apples or oranges. You might be led to believe that because prickly pear workers are payed comparitively high that its economically stimulating for Mexico and other countries which export the prickly pear.  Its correct to infer that the prickly pear is not the sole cause of international economic hardships caused by fruit especially considering how companies which make massproduced fruit with high demand pay their workers even less than those which produce barbary figs. Just to give you an idea of how little people who dethorn prickly pears actually make the average wage for someone in this comparitively highpaying position make about  pesos per day. Thats about  USD for an entire day of fulltime work where a worker is expected to make  full crates of prickly pears ready for export including packaging and dethorning them. Also to point out how little the price of a prickly pear is marked up at the point of export it costs about  pesos for the owner of a production facility to prepare a full crate of prickly pears. Around  of revenue generated by prickly pears goes into advertisement. The primary buyer for exported prickly pears is The United States importing a little more than  million kilograms in . Canada is the nd most common place of export but at only  kg the U.S. imports more than  of Mexicos prickly pears. Internationally the demand for prickly pears is low with the exception of Japan which is sporatic and unpredictable leading very few suppliers to seek exportation to there and France which has recently overtaken Japan in terms of prickly pear importation. . of all prickly pears imported by the United States come from Mexico.One fundamental problem with generating significant demand for the prickly pear outside areas which it is natively grown is the impracticality of the exterior. Much like bananas prickly pears are typically eaten after removing the outer layer of fruit which generates a comparatively large amount of waste per fruit. This has created a fairly significant standstill in the prickly pear market because in order to raise demand for the fruit by making it more usable by the general public a consumer would ideally want their product preskinned which would require manpower and likely frozen which would also be an enormous drain on resources. The skin also makes up a large amount of the exported fruits so it would make prickly pear farms unable to meet their expected quotas because it would take many more of the fruit to make up the weight demanded by importers.Despite the relative significance of the prickly pear industry and cacti in general to both American and Mexican producers and retailers most people will live their entire lives and die never having known the economic issues surrounding cactus imports. Growing old and becoming bitter towards youth will lead the facts about the industry to face away and prevent any change from happening. The prickly pear plantations will likely then die off leaving thousands of people unemployed because of the lack of awareness surrounding one of Mexicos economic staples. We will live in a future where a fruit which was once shipped in enormous quantities is now something which only a select few have even heard of. If you ever want to know more about the cactus export industry feel free to ask.TLDR Dont let time change you learn about whatever you can. The things you can learn today will eventually become irrelevant and obselete and no one will be left to carry on what people worked so hard to create. ,intj,conv6se,6,t5_2qowo

3321560,0,t1_cp6he00,gt Perhaps I should have phrased my post as that Im not very quantitative and in business analytical thinking essentially is quantitative.This isnt necessarily true.  Theres a lot of qualitative analysis in business. Sure the process may start with the numbers but a lot of it is figuring out the reasons behind the numbers in order to improve.  For example you can look at financial statements and compare ratios all day but the numbers dont tell the whole story.  Understanding what drives the numbers is key which can be and usually is largely qualitative.  Big picture thinking requires a view of the entire picture which includes the data and numbers.  You may not enjoy it as much but the best analysis takes both quantitative and qualitative factors into consideration.  I may be biased because I am a very quantitative person but I am also extremely big picture oriented and am very good at combining the two.  I think its a common INTJ trait.  Maybe you just havent had the right exposure? As a philosophy major Im assuming you havent had much exposure to quantitative analysis other than what you may have encountered in a work environment which isnt always the best way to learn especially if you dont have the raw skills.

3563296,0,t3_311jgx,Well approach anxiety is one problem you already identified. This is most often caused by expectations you need to learn to let go of your expectations entirely and just enjoy the thing for what it is. Maybe the thing is a relationship platonic or romantic is irrelevant. Maybe the thing is a job or a meeting or a video game whatever expectations ruin everything. That was my problem with socializing expectations. I kept being idealistic INTJ and needing everyone to either be a friend which to me means they would die for you if thats what it took to make you happy. So obviously theyd do anything less than die for me too. It was either that or were not friends. I didnt have any friends longer than a year. And they werent friends they were acquaintances. Now Ive lowered my standards my expectations. Now I expect nothing from anyone. Going out with a group of people and you didnt calltext me? I dont care have fun!Odd thing is now that this is my attitude people want to see me so much I feel burdened by it. For instance Im putting off going out to karaoke with a group of friends right now. I dont wanna put pants on come on its Wednesday. But its important to them that I go and I agreed when they made the plans like  weeks ago. Fucking fuck it all. These people arent my friends at least not according to my standards. But were all best friends according to theirs. I have no idea what their standards are but for me now all these people are is a distraction from being alone. Want to go watch UFC? Ive got dozens of people I can call. Want to go skiing? Well theyre all still mostly broke so that I still do alone mostly. But you get the idea theyre people to do things with not the highly idealized incredible bond and relationship that held Sam and Frodo together. No thats something I likely will never find in this world. Even my brother doesnt respect me that much doesnt place that much trust in me. Probably the only people who do are infants trusting and respecting their parents which Im told all goes straight down hill at the age of . But my personal experience was much different I thought my mother incapable of lying until like  or  or something. Anyhow theres some thoughts on your post gotta go. Good luck!,intj,cpyfxa4,1,t5_2qowo

3662200,0,t3_32ahhd,If I can manage it at all I try to cook in a private setting. If I can get a girl to my apartment and make her a meal most of the battle is over. However I do this because I know it is an area where I shine pick something you are good at that will impress and leave room for socializing. Movies theaters are a bad idea because you cant talk movies in a dorm room or apartment might not be. If you know of a shared interest try to work that into the setting.Theres more to it of course. The ability to hold an interesting conversation is key. I have a collection of memories which I occasionally draw upon interesting aspects of my life which share well. Its important not to push these things so I am generally monitoring the dialogue and trying to keep a balance between light and fun and sincere and personal as well as a reasonably equitable balance between my contributions to the dialogue and hers.But perhaps most importantly all of the above is a fallback. Any good date conversation flows naturally. One comment reminds you of another causes them to think of another and so on and so forth and a tapestry begins to appear the way your lives and personalities interweave and interact until youre no longer two strangers but two people whose interests converge and diverge sufficiently to suggest a possibility of getting along in the future.Being able to be mildly suggestive without crossing the line too soon is also helpful. I am not going to teach you how to flirt but if you dont want to fail miserably I suggest learning how to pick up on at least basic body language and signs of mutual attraction.I realize this is somewhat vague. Easy cliche advice? Think of how you talk to your friends. Think of who you are when youre not trying to be special when youre not trying to make sure everything is perfect... and lean on that. Chances are if someone likes you having spent some time around you normally as you describe theyve seen something of who you really are and thats what they like.It never fails to surprise me what some people think of certain aspects of myself. Things which annoy some people drive others to insane degrees of loyalty affection and attraction. Realizing that makes it fairly easy not to judge yourself and just be as you go about your business.TLDR shit is complicated wear deodorant brush your teeth and try not to mumble too much.

3778756,0,t3_33o4ox,I think as someone else commented that its a matter of not receiving instant reward the conversations are meaningless not engaging but I think identity is also an important element of our personality and it plays into this. By that I mean that we need to be true to who we are all the time. Which is a difficult thing to do when most conversations possess no real value that would make a substantial change in someones life and we are by design purposeful individuals. But listen make an effort to overcome these feelings you have right now. Youll thank yourself later. You might not see the usefulness now but at some point youre going to need connections in order to accomplish something. Youll need all those boring individuals who probably mean nothing to you. To bring things on a more positive note listen without judging. There is some value in most ideas. You can derive something out of almost everything. As an exercise listen and imagine what a professor or a smart person you appreciate would say upon hearing a what seems to be worthless idea. There are nuances and infinite other ways of saying something  maybe that is the meaning behind meaningless conversations. Appreciate the fact that we are humans and we can communicate in such a large variety of ways using some words but not others expressing some ideas while keeping others to ourselves and so on. ,intj,cqn07ia,5,t5_2qowo

This strongly driven attitude masks an inner insecurity that probably stems from the fact that your faith in a person you are close to in people in general or in the justness of fate has been seriously shaken. When you are beset by problems you say to yourself Dont panic! I can get help from my......vigorous effort.You need a task that inspires you and allows you to give your all. If serious demands are made on your abilities or your strengths you mobilize all your creativity and really stay on the ball in order to prove to yourself and others what you are capable of. If your efforts are acknowledged you are prepared to do your best. Should someone approach you with unfair demands or even worse with outright injustice however you resolutely fend them off. At present you are working particularly hard for......joyful fulfillment of your desires.It is very important to you to achieve what you are striving for and to experience the joyful fulfillment of your wishes. The thing that actually often compels you into action is your deep yearning for unadulterated lasting happiness and inner peace. If you seek these things in the realm of material possessions relationships and experiences you will suffer disappointment over and over again. You believe you have the magic formula for achieving unadulterated happiness namely......relaxing favorite pastime.When the difficulties of daily life or human interaction become too much you prefer to retreat to your favorite pastime a quiet hobby or into the world of your thoughts dreams and fantasies. If you try to achieve the necessary balance to daily routine through a regular practice of meditation you will find what you have actually been looking for inner detachedness and peace. It would also be ideal if you could occasionally spend time in the great outdoors. You believe a particular help in achieving the inner peace you desire is......nurturing useful relationships.Due to the fact that you are stuck in a genuinely unpleasant situation you seek contact with helpful people you hope will show you understanding and provide you with moral support. It could be that you receive the necessary encouragement but in the end you have to solve your personal problems yourself. Your common sense will help you in this. You believe that right now two things can help your intelligence and......deliberate selfdetermination.You know for yourself what you need to do and not do and you want to create a life in accordance with your own ideas. You are trying to establish an independent sphere of your own. You would like to see things as they are and you prefer to make decisions on the basis of facts and objective information. Your primary focus of interest is on everything that is practical and expedient or that serves to increase your autonomy.At the moment you feel most anxious due to your......frightening lack of power.You constantly see yourself confronted with a mountain of difficulties and problems. At the same time you dont want to let yourself be dragged down by feelings of despair and resignation. For this reason you concentrate on achieving what is most important to you right now. The resources you employ in doing so range from winning affability to skillful manipulation all the way to authoritarian pressure because you want to get everything under control. Your fear of being powerless arouses exactly the opposite in you a thirst for power. You also feel powerless in the face of your......adverse existential uncertainty.You are suffering from the fact that you have to do without certain amenities enjoyments and pleasures because you dont have enough money to afford them. You have no lack of ideas for what you could do and buy but your uncertain existential situation hinders you in carrying this through. It is also possible you have decided to use your money for more important things. At the moment you are unsure what you should do about your......inner restlessness.You have a very sensitive nature and for this reason you try as quickly as possible to forget unpleasant experiences by distracting yourself through all means of activity. Naturally your restlessness cant bring you the inner peace you yearn for. On the contrary the repressed negative emotions can manifest themselves through sudden shifts in mood or fits of bad temper. You are unable to find inner peace due to your......oppressive sense of apprehension.You are concerned about a situation the outcome of which is uncertain. You contemplate various options of what you could do so that everything turns out the way you think it ought to. In doing so you cling too rigidly to your own views and you have too little faith that it might also be good for you if for once events evolved differently from what you had imagined. By the way no problem has ever been solved by worrying. You worriedly ask yourself how things will progress with regard to your......continuing lack of enjoyment.You feel that difficult circumstances are limiting your ability to experience and enjoy things and this frustrates you and makes you sensitive to every manner of restriction demand or even criticism that some person tries to impose on you. You believe you have to fend off such intentions and to act vigorously in order to obtain what you need. You are unable to truly enjoy life due to your......fear of misunderstanding.You are fairly well convinced of your personal viewpoints and you are certain that your needs demands and plans are justified but you fear others will show no understanding for them. In reality you are often faced with misunderstanding reserve or resistance because you are stubborn and a knowitall. But you hardly let yourself be put off your stride.So heres the thing. I agree with everything this thing has come up with and I have no idea how it ended up being so painfully accurate especially on the four major points unwavering stability because of vigorous effort and frightening lack of power due to existential uncertainty but I really question the system behind it.

Because its rare I was basically told that I wasnt an INTJ and to retake the test.  I believe I was  at the time.  I was too nice or not really smart enough.  Ive consistently tested as INTJ since.  The amount of stigma and jealousy that affects people is appalling.  Theres so many people that want things their way theyll put others down in order to make things appear less so.

He said You didnt answer my question. Obviously it was not the other questions and discussion points that he made that mattered. It was the ignorant and obvious answer that he wanted to know...he just added everything else to probably hide the fact that his question wasnt a good question. For a sort of deep discussion a person needs to keep with everything that is said and keep track of it. Anything else is worthless and that person is not worthy to debate because he cant do it property. It was his gain for the answer even though he knew the answer...I didnt lose anything and in fact I showed his true colors because his professor was around and he sort of yelled the fbomb so he got in trouble with his professor. I think now he hates me for that. Its his fault and his loss and I didnt lose anything. Winwin situation for me. He had it coming  usually if its someone I dont like Ill come up with a plan to bring that person their downfall in someway or another but he got in trouble because of his own self and weaknesses of not being able to control his emotions.

I would say the leading guy I can think of is Dr. Lorenzo Bruzzone  he does change detection for a lot of different types of data Optical  Multispectral  Hyperspectrallow and high res SAR. Hes currently heading up as technical cochair of the IGARSS  conference likely the biggest conference in the world regarding RS. In any case I got very fortunate in that my institution is both a research and development unit so they help fund academics and then provide jobs to them afterwards. This has allowed me to work in the field gain experience meet people developing solutions for problems we can try fix with RS and work on own operational systems whilst doing my masters  PhD. I would advise looking for a place like that because you cant beat being paid to study and gaining experience in a cool field. As for SAR itself its different to say the least. Depending on the sourcerequirements its also very expensive or free Sentinel  imagery. Id advise downloading Sentinel  tools used to be called NEST and then download a SAR image or two from the Sentinel  freely available dataset. Its level  data if I recall correctly which is good because most of the tough work has been done for you at that level.

You need to love and be confident in yourself and your own abilities.  if your depression is based around being lonely  you need to love yourself before someone else will love you   thats tough and clich as fuck but its  true.  build your self esteem around yourself  your own capabilities and the rest will come naturally.,intj,crckw3w,2,t5_2qowo

By that I mean I set a standard for myselfif I dropped below a certain GPA or if I felt like I was steering myself in the wrong path I would force myself to make things work in my favor.

4327874,0,t3_3aj7ij,One of the most important things I learned about myself being an INTJ is that being likable and agreeable is something that needs to be worked at like anything else. I noticed pretty early in my teens that I was know it all prick who thought he was better than nearly everyone but I was also a miserable lonely sod as well so I figured Id sacrifice some of the behaviours of that me for the sake of friendship  and putting the effort to making the few friendships that really matter and thats really the most you can do. You really have to fake it until you make it. Ill use the Sims or Mount and Blade series as examples. You have to perform tasks to gain peoples esteem and trust so they can open up to you. Its just more complicated because the options you have in real life are so much more numerous than the ones in games. So find someone who you want to be friends with spend time with them be prepared to just listen ask questions about them and find people you can share interests with becausee soing an activity you both like like debating or squash or what have you. Dont tax yourself too much as an INTJ its just sort of natural to need alone time but we tend to need to push ourselves out of our comfort zones to be happy or at least I find that. You also should realise its a slow process and people arent going to open up to you all at once. TLDR Push yourself to be more social look at yourself objectively to make sure youre not a massive asshole and be patient in order to keep and find friends.,intj,csdhbf2,3,t5_2qowo

4448713,0,t3_3c0mwn,This is a good start your Te has led you in the right directionyou just gave your extraverted thinking an outlet by writing up this post. As far as Jungian psych goes youre on the right track there.  I really encourage you to keep using your Te. Here are some ways you can do so. Carry a paper notebook and a pen with you and write down your ideas as they come to you.. Write down questions you have when things pique your curiosity.. Find some writing cues then follow the list in your computers text editor or on paper. Heres my list. You can respond on your own time to any or all of them Date   What excites me right now or makes me feel curious inside? What makes me sad right now? What am I feeling? List them out first then expand on feelings as necessary. Where will I be in five years? List another alternative? Then another one? TO DO Am I avoiding anything? What tasks or projects am I avoiding? Whats concerning me? Spiritualityhow is it? Physicalityhow is it? Mentalityhow is it? Am I in the grip today or normative? How am I engaging in Se extraverted sensing activities that may be destructive or assisting my avoidance of important steps? Am I overeating? Watching TV? Listening to loud music? etc. How am I allowing my Fi to discourage me or perhaps give me the wrong message about how people feel about me? How could I further engage my Te extraverted thinking to get out? What would be a risk I could take today? What is my prayer for the day what would I ask for if I could ask anything?Some other adviceMany life coaches business coaches therapists and counselors offer a free first session. Even in thirdworld countries you may be able to visit talk and the release of your thoughts in an extraverted fashion should be helpful just by itself. If you have an area of specialty in your educational past you could visit a teacher or professor who specializes in that area ask for a few minutes of their time explain your situation and ask their advice.INTJs have a special giftthey can often think out  write out  chart out  talk out the solutions to their own problems. Sometimes you just need a tipping point.Ironanimation also mentioned David Burns and his written depressionanxiety assessments can be helpful as extraverted thinking activities for INTJs. I used to take one of those assessments about once a week and the measurement alone had a lot of value to it. Feel free to try anything you think will work. I even like hypnosismy university had a hypnosis and biofeedback lab and I would listen to scripts like this one which helped me quite a bit Regarding motivation in general my advice is to lower your expectations to that of a common slug sorry if they dont have those creatures where you live  and surprise yourself a little bit every day. I have been there long ago in a bright blue sleeping bag in a dark room in a rundown house in a dreary winter with roommates knocking on my door every couple evenings to ask if I needed help.

All the descriptions I pulled from Amazon.The Alchemist This story dazzling in its simplicity and wisdom is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of treasure buried in the Pyramids... but what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a meditation on the treasures found within.The  Habits of Highly Effective People Powerful Lessons in Personal Change Has been a top seller for the simple reason that it ignores trends and pop psychology for proven principles of fairness integrity honesty and human dignity.Predictably Irrational When it comes to making decisions in our lives we think were in control. We think were making smart rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating often surprising experiments MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research Ariely explains how expectations emotions social norms and other invisible seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.How to Win Friends amp Influence People You can go after the job you want...and get it!

The Paradox of Choice We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run this can lead to decisionmaking paralysis anxiety and perpetual stress. And in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless too much choice can lead to clinical depression. The Personal MBA Master the Art of Business Getting an MBA is an expensive choice  one almost impossible to justify regardless of the state of the economy.

You can get better results and save hundreds of thousands of dollars by skipping business school altogether...The Wisdom of Crowds Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few Explores a deceptively simple idea that has profound implications large groups of people are smarter than an elite few no matter how brilliant. Groups are better at solving problems fostering innovation coming to wise decisions even predicting the future. This seemingly counterintuitive notion has endless and major ramifications for how businesses operate how knowledge is advanced how economies are or should be organized and how we live our daily lives.Switch Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies in our communities and in our own lives? The primary obstacle is a conflict thats built into our brains say Chip and Dan Heath authors of the critically acclaimed best seller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems the rational mind and the emotional mind that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort but if it is overcome change can come quickly.Economics in One Lesson explains basic truths about economics and the economic fallacies responsible for unemployment inflation high taxes and recession. Covering considerable ground Hazlitt illustrates the destructive effects of taxes rent and price controls inflation trade restrictions and minimum wage laws.

To verify that a digital circuit operating at high speed will work you do static timing analysis which makes sure that the signal will propagate from one flop to another in less than one clock cycle less some time for clock skew setuphold etc. On the actual pins to a high speed chip you typically run slower and wider more parallel or have special hardware between your digital signals and the pins that does analog signal preemphasis and a few other things to avoid signal integrity issues over longer traces.

4826953,0,t1_cu2jdj4,gt I really appreciate you being so understanding as I certainly did not mean offense.No none taken. I will admit that seeing INTP in there made me a bit uncomfortable though since Ive struggled with INTP friends and clients in the past. Its always the typical INTPINTJ thing where they criticize our lack of original thought and we criticize their hesitance to efficiently apply a body of existing research.  In the end I think the two parties both realize we need to use our secondary functions more.gt but I am mostly looking at the big picture.That is an extremely lucky thing from where Im standing. I am trying to figure out how to do that more for my own clients because its not only less stressful but it really brings more of my gifts to bear.gt I did not know that was Se though. I would love more resources about thisBeside Ourselves is a really good one I think if a book would work for you. Also if you google INJ form of the inferior function someone has posted a fantastic excerpt from Was that really me? that goes into amazing depth.gt I understand Te as partly about arranging objects in space and applying patterns. I had no idea about that. The closest I have come is to see Ni as calling out patterns to us. Whether those are picked up and carried by our Te or Fi seems to depend a lot on our maturity and MBTI education level.gt This can be generalized and applied to a lot of different activities with Ni. New to me againI see Ni as presenting our mind with information that it is up to Te to process and apply. gt So from abstract stuff like categorizingbrainstorming These are what Ive learned as traditional Te activities in the same boat with blogging writing planning charting mindmapping discussing our thoughts with a counselorconsultantcoach etc. As long as we are applying our thoughts T directly to the object Extraverted attitude where attitude is the jungian term used for the direction in which we apply the thinking or feeling the outcome is an objectively applicable plan or set of principles as opposed to Tis subjective results.gt and geometryNew to me! Love to know more though.gt to laying out paragraphs and ideas in a piece of writing Ah yep. Ideas more than paragraphs is what Ive learned though. Which is to say Ive never heard of paragraphs mentioned as a use of Te but outlining definitely yes.gt to the elements of a graphic design. Inventing those elements yes. Writing out or charting the way they work to ourselves and others as a way of helping us learn graphic design big yes.But applying those elements that is at the very least overlapping with Se insofar as graphics and design both hold a sensory allure to INTJs.gt It also comes into play when you start thinking about the logical rulesCheck. But especially when you extravert your thinking in other words write it say it blog it chart it outline it etc.gt of aesthetics like color relationships chord and harmonic structures in music golden ratios use of negative space etc. Yes. And I have to say I love all those things! Learning to apply them can really bring out my Se though. For example applying the golden ratio requires a practice  feedback  adjustment loop that is often too detailoriented for me to sustain for long. My Ni on the other hand is really good at shortcutting that by saying just shape your composition in this way it will look great and there is no need for all this ratio stuff. I may have to draw out that conclusion with my Te but it was Nis nebulous idea to start with. gt Music I am thinking more about visually picturing the sounds as things with shape and texture and color an arrangement in space. That sounds like Se to me to the degree that it is sensory in an extraverted pitchan open direct sensory fascination with the object itself the sensation of the sound. This is huge to INTJs but it draws heavily on the allure of our inferior function.gt I guess that is technically what they call synesthesiaYes similar to it at least and definitely concerned with sensory  sensate processing.gt though I think its just a result of the INTJ preference for visual thinking. That could be. The theory as far as I recall is that our Ni gets its magical insightproducing skill from our Ses tendency to subconsciously notice and remember certain sensory details. This would probably make visual thinking a natural gift for us. I know it is something I draw on quite often.gt I can do this visually on a computer and I kind of think of it more like sound painting than musicianship in a way.Yes. From what Ive read we have a special gift there but it works the same way that e.g. Te works for an INFP. It is our inferior process at work and we can really surprise people with it who knew those robotic INTJs could be this artsy...?!. However its best used to help us recreate or relax. If we start to rely on it too much it can pull us further into its grip a.k.a. the grip within MBTI circles a result of excluding our lessexciting but more helpful Te.,intj,cu2z6uk,1,t5_2qowo

It did however give me some insight into myself that I then tried to use productively.I dont think its sufficient to give you confidence if confidence is already lacking though.

There will be numerous people to chime in and tell us how we cant be both but I think we function differently depending on the circumstances and the environment. Sometimes I am more in tune with one type versus the other and it isnt static. Im quite sure someone is gnashing their teeth as they read that but it is interesting how many different interpretations there are out there. Unfortunately it all becomes a bit like astrology when taken to extremes and you get different camps that take vague meanings and apply them as they see fit. Some will tell us how many people are simply uninformed and that is the reason for disparity but it goes beyond just that.Personally I dont feel this is a precise science and the types are a bit fuzzy. I dont think we can be defined in very narrow terms due to the complexity of being human and when you have very wide terms it becomes subjective and open to interpretation. I do think there are probably some people who fit certain profilestypes better than others but some of us are more variable.

People generally understand that even if you seem nervous you are still trying.Those who go mute when nervous or who answer questions with single words will risk being perceived as snobbish or disinterested.  Learn to say A goodinterestingdifficult question.  Let me think about that for a moment followed by a pause to collect some thoughts followed by an efficient sentence or two on the subject.  Nobody wants to be greeted by a terse yesno nor do they want to be treated to verbal diarrhea.  I think that INTJs are extremely good at creating thorough efficient answers to questions if they get a minute to ponder.  The important step is letting the interviewer know that there will be a pause.Another good interviewing trick to handle small talk is to turn it around.  Maybe you dont like politics but youre being asked your opinion about the Republican debate.  You know I meant to watch that but was too busy.  Who do you think won?  Nod smile listen carefully for something to ask a question about.  I see your point.  Do you think he won on the strength of his immigration platform or was it something else?  People will generally carry an entire conversation for you if you ask them informed openended questions.  They will also credit you for participating even though you basically just returned the ball every time.  The only requirement is that you seem interested.  A side benefit of this tactic is that you wind up interviewing them a little bit.  Is this the kind of boss or coworker you want?  You can sometimes get a little spark as kindred minds meet then the conversation wont be hard at all.Anyway all just my opinion.  Fake it til you make it.,intj,cv5x264,2,t5_2qowo

My body and the sexgender that describes it does not affect my daytoday life in any other way. If I woke up in the other body tomorrow that would affect my romantic relationships and that would change how I wore my hair and what I dressed in to go to fancy events but I dont feel like it would change who I am in any way.

If the music is good the voice sounds great for the rhythm and all in all the mood is perfect I will sing along since it deserve it usually creating a new universe to live within the song to resolve my lack of relating with the story.Example my favorite song is Mama from Genesis. The lyrics are about a teenage boy who has a crush on a hooker. I dont relate to that. Hell even the alleged situation its so rare that the hole lyrics are almost useless.

5578373,0,t3_3rj48w,Most of the relationship details people whether INTJ or otherwise tend to overanalyze are the sorts of things that can be figured out far more directly by good communication.  When you catch yourself obsessing over what something means... seriously consider just asking.  If it all comes down to aspects of just how mutual is our interest? then ask him that  e.g. Hey I really like you and am interested in continuing to date you but Im having a hard time telling whether or not were on the same page could you maybe clear that up for me a bit?Yes some people exist for whom being that direct is considered a negative somethingsomething taking all the romance out... but its clear youre not one for mindgames of that nature and you probably shouldnt try to date anyone who would demand them of you.  I think a lot of people have trouble turning their brain off in cases like this because suppressing the need for analysis is difficult and especially so for INTJs.

5621631,0,t3_3s3lou,Right I dug up your past a little. So you are in a relationship with an INTJ. When you argue like couples do. You feel like she knows how to press your buttons.Well she probably does. Sometimes we do it because we want to hurt youbut you have to start by insulting us first but most of the times its just the simple fact that the truth hurts. Sugar coating it is not helping anybody. When you ask something like Do these pants make me look fat ? Ill probably say No ofcourse not. You being fat makes you look fat. But only if you really are fat. We are blunt and we speak our minds. But just because we do that doesnt make us inconsiderate. We care enough to tell you the truth. If we didnt like you we wouldnt waste the time or energy to tell you the truth.Keeping in mind what I just said we are blunt and to the point. I can see you maybe didnt mean for this post to be a fuck all of you. But instead a missguided attempt at getting a honest answer. The others might get pissed at me for saying this so dont tell anybody. But we are actually people too. We can not read your mind so when you post a question like that add some more detail. It helps us a lot. Because I had to go through your previous posts to figure out what you might have ment. So in conclusion either your gf is an inconsderate bitch or she cares about you enough to tell you the truth or you are just an asshole who came here to insult INTJs in generall in which case fuck you.,intj,cwtx0u6,20,t5_2qowo

5634843,0,t3_3sajbz,Its extremely unlikely you simply switched from one to the other since INTJs use Te and Fi while INFJs use Ti and Fe. This is such a tremendous difference that you should be able to tell which one you are by doing your own research. Normally the older you get the more accurate the results should be. But there is more to figuring out your type than that. Just figure out which cognitive functions you feel you use the most. You cant be both and you cant switch whenever you want. What you can do is develop other cognitive functions you never used very much in your teens. Now that you are older you might have more versatility other than just Ni but your core functions havent changed.

Humans arent nearly as rational as we like to think we are we are naturally intuitive thinkers. We develop intuition over time and our brains learn those patterns. Humans are great at finding patterns. INTJs do the same thing but on a different level. We are primarily intuitive we reach conclusions quickly through intuition and then have to back up to explain how we got there with logic. At the level that the brain does its base cognitive processing it is doing basically what the INTJ does with higherlevel brain functions. edit Not sure I explained that very well but that kinda supports my point haha,intj,cx7eacp,2,t5_2qowo

A socially inept introvert can work on their social skills and that will make them a sociallyadept introvert. Not an extrovert. Extroverts can have poor social skills as well.  Making yourself better will not change you personality type because personality is not about changeable skills and there isnt a personality type that is better than other personality types.

My testimony is long and actually involves the sort of divine revelation I think many INTJs are very waryskeptical about. If you want to hear it you can PM me. but anyways I havent really found a niche in my church yet in terms of service which is what I assume you mean when you say role in the church. I help here and there on sunday mornings nursery taking offering setting upcleaning up etc. volunteer where I can events service projects helping other church members in need etc.. I know none of these things really play to my strengths as an INTJ nor is it something most INTJs would volunteer for but Ive found them fulfilling in the sense that I am able to obey God in the small things.  Corinthians  says But he said to me My grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christs power may rest on me. That is why for Christs sake I delight in weaknesses in insults in hardships in persecutions in difficulties. For when I am weak then I am strong. I think this may be difficult for some INTJs to swallow but for me recognizing your weaknesses is a sign of maturity. Allowing God to come fill in and flourish in our gaps is a great reminder of the limitations of our humanity and how blessed we are to be chosen to come alongside God in accomplishing his vision for the world.That said I hope that Ill be asked or find something that fits my personality better or really excel in but for right now Im just glad I have the opportunity to serve.Not really church related although the guy that runs the nonprofit is from my church but I also mentor  high school kids from the inner city alongside my INFJ friend. I think I do really well in helping they think about their future while my friend is able to relate and connect with them in a way where my advice can apply. Sometimes I can come across to the kids as too businesslike but my friend is able to bring it down to their level. They seem to be more open with him but from what he tells me they do seem to take what I say into consideration its just harder for them to open up to me. In that way I think we make a good tandem. ,intj,cxa6qim,2,t5_2qowo

5791932,0,t3_3uhbut,F and Id never even had a crush until I met my current partner this year. In retrospect I was absolutely infatuated with her very quickly after I met her but it took me quite a while several months to recognize it because it was a really foreign feeling to me. I dont really have input on beforeafter maturity because of this. As far as loving my SO goes I dont feel as if thats a sharp divide where I didnt love her and then did. I think actual love not infatuation is something that develops as you form a bond with a person and deepens as you grow closer. Its like liking someone is taking a walk on the beach and loving them is beginning to take steps into the water. When you get your ankles wet thats not quite as intense as being waist deep but youre still in the ocean. Right now with my SO I might only be shin deep but Im hoping that one day Ill be swimming. ,intj,cxf1lcx,2,t5_2qowo

We relate very well obviously and it helps to have someone completely understand your mode of thinking. Whats really great about it is that we help each other recognize where our weaknesses are and develop ideas on how to be better in those areas.

Mostly my desperation to blend in as normal as a teenager so I went for an easy target of a girl. Sure she was stupid as f...I need to stop insulting her probably. Neah....uck but hey I got a girlfriend. Better than nothing probably. It sure was a helpful experience and I learned from it...and I just sounded like a cheap quote.Funny its my first time in a long while that Ive thought about this subjectrelationship and Im really having a smile laughing at my actions and being at peace with my past. Hehe.More on the subject ignoring my past actions that I will call stupid It makes sense not to get back together if there was any reason to split. Sure not all relationship are greatperfect but some dont need to dissolve for any little thing and they still go at a more or less OK rate. And for the second part of the question I would take her back? many negative words and insults regarding my lack of willingness and her sheer stupidity ,intj,cxikr4k,1,t5_2qowo

5926822,0,t3_3wigki,Good thingsIt is a way for socially underdeveloped sometimes marginalized men to get a grasp of some fundamental social concepts and gives them confidence to try to form relationships and improve themselves. Not everyone learns good attachment skills and emotional intelligence from family or community when growing up and these guy really do need help. Bad thingsThe whole approach centers on creating superficial relationships and protecting the male ego. It is a very malecentric approach with a lot of hostility toward women in the culture. It teaches an adversarial view of relationships of all types and doesnt go very far to address what I think is the real issue male alienation and Western cultures tragically inadequate way of raising boys to be confident capable of attachment and emotionally aware. I feel for men they have a lot of false responsibilities and roles forced on them society and because we have very different gender norms for men and women men face very different issues. Whose issues are worse or more important isnt particularly relevant to the individual who feels like a misfit and is struggling to form satisfying connections to others. ,intj,cxwjd24,3,t5_2qowo

6001681,0,t1_cy2w00j,Heres some advice. When I was in college I felt the same way. Heres the truth college is about learning to apply yourself not about completing assignments and taking tests. What youre really learning is how to build and make efficient a skill called applying yourself.  When INTJs struggle in school its probably because the work isnt challenging enough but the truth is its because the INTJ doesnt understand the challenge...Heres a warning. Take university seriously and learn to apply yourself in any given thing in life. Change your focus from completing assignments and taking tests to treating these things as measures of your skills and value as a person. Learn to work hard efficiently and effectively.If youre not in a STEM major change immediately. Jobs are so rare that if you want to get the value out of youre college experience you need to be in STEM and do internships. Seriously man from someone who thought just like you and wasted their college studying philosophy because it was easy and fun...start thinking about how your education is going to get you a secure job.,intj,cy6cmx7,1,t5_2qowo

6038165,0,t3_3y6tv5,Ive never been much for the holidays and neither is my husband. We live across the country from his mum and so we see her once a year maybe two but usually not during the holidays. Luckily I put this in parentheses because some people may not see it as luck and might be offended Im an orphan. I have zero family so I do not have holiday familial obligations. I also hate getting stuff because I think most things are useless unless its actively helping me get a result on a goal I am trying to reach or its an experience with my husband. So we usually dont exchange gifts nor do we give any to friends. In lieu of gifts we give money to a select group of charities that we have personally worked with in the past. But Im with you guys  Im not for large crowds or mandatory events even if it is with people I care about. I generally spend my time as I see fit and I make an effort to see those I love at good intervals  this means I see holiday obligations as forced and I dont do well when I feel forced.That being said my husband and I are celebrating with a quiet dinner out in our city and then watching documentaries on Netflix.

6058349,0,t3_3yi6st,gtAn INTJ once told me he didnt believe in friendship that hed rather only rely on himself.Neither do I. My general rule is to rely on myself or on those whove proven themselves to be reliable. While I prefer to do things on my own I value friendships once theyve turned out to be valuable. In other words I need concrete proof of something having value to acknowledge it. Also while INTJs and INTPs as well are considered cold it doesnt mean they dont have feelings or are unable to have and create them it rather suggests that they might have issues showing them properly. On a general note I value my close circle of friends more than my family because those people have shown to hold value to me.  ,intj,cydquut,1,t5_2qowo

Regarding the more managerial side I can obviously see and understand that many undeservedly reach their positions.

6424957,0,t3_43onds,Its because the meaning of a message is determined by the receiver. We only have control of how we deliver the message we cant control the receivers interpretation of our message. If I say could you hand me that screwdriver some people will assume Id like them to pick up the screwdriver and give it to me. Some will assume that I am an asshole and I treat them like a slave. Some will assume I dont really need the screwdriver and Im secretly flirting with them. Some will assume that I just want the screwdriver so I can stab them in the neck and watch the life drain from their eyes. Thats why we like communicating with people we know well and have accepted into the circle. Less signals noise. I think INTJs understand this subconsciously and defines quite a bit about how we communicate overall. Or dont communicate. This also ties into the emotions thing. How do you communicate a message to someone that is hysterical or furious? The message is going to be defined by the state they are in not what you mean. So we retreat until our message has the data connection it needs. ,intj,czjvlp5,17,t5_2qowo

6521669,0,t1_czt2an8,I am an INTJ and second what uZakuZen says about respecting your autonomy  most of us especially when past early adulthood arent going to fight to keep a relationship when our SO says they want to break up.  If the other person wants out then we dont want in  and nothing makes for a shitty breakup like one party begging and pleading and guilttripping the one whos leaving.So youre going to have to be the one who comes back at this juncture if you want to.  If the relationship is worth continuing as it has been then do so.  Settle in and enjoy what you have between you and see where things go.  If you pressure him to commit whatever his reasons for not wanting to hes going to dig in his heels and things are going to go downhill pretty fast.  Only thing you can really do is let him get to that point himself if things are good enough as they are to keep you around.If you cant be happy with where things have been and are going to feel like hes withholding care and resent him for it probably best you do walk away.,intj,cztw4cw,3,t5_2qowo

6544406,0,t1_czsteiz,Yeah I agree you might be idolizing Nicholas Sparksstyle romanticism too much. A man can still care about you deeply even if he doesnt talk about hisyour feelings all too often.

6546318,0,t1_czwf6ha,Ive never been in a romantic relationship if thats what you mean the thought of it makes me squeamish. With friends I have two types one on one friendships and group friends. I have some friends who I just meet with individually and we just talk and have really long conversations. If we seem like an intellectual match and agree on the essentials but have different specialties and types of knowledge I like to meet up with them to learn moreexpand on my own ideas. This can be really draining though so I only like to meet up with these types of friends every two weeks or so. Then theres the type of friends where were in a friend group. I enjoy this more and do pretty well in these environments because you can sit on the sidelines or take the limelight depending on your mood. I like to get to know them better by doing things with them which adds some excitement to my life traveling adventuring and eating together. Even though I usually dont drink Ill join them if they go to bars and some parties where alcohol is involved. They appreciate that I dont look down on them like some nondrinkers and just go to have a good time with them. I wont go to clubs though thats where I draw my line. So I guess my answer is that I establish friendship intimacy through conversations and shared activities that serve as good memories and bonds us closer. But romantically I dont do that period. My guess is that is has a lot to do with the way I was raised but also with part of my innate personality.   ,intj,czwfxwq,2,t5_2qowo

6829082,0,t1_d0oglcb,How interesting so a somewhat loose correlation to toxic poisoning with ADHD? Instead of merely saying someone is bored and acting out? I think we have to understand that many school systems are outdated and the course material may not be engaging to the majority of the students. Its rare to find a good school these days.I am wondering if you wouldve had the same experience had you done to the AltSchool or the Montessori school? Also I think its important to understand whether you are a visual aural or kinesthetic thinker? Howard Gardner has a theory about multiple intelligences Most traditional schools cater towards linguistic and logicalmathematical thinkers. It might be that you think adderall makes you smarter but adderall may really just suppress your natural inclination and learning style in favor of the ones that school prioritize but that doesnt mean you are dumb without adderall. In addition the potential reasons you listed for ADHD development arent genetic causes they are environmental causes. Low birth weight alcohol smokingdrugs while pregnant lead exposure have a correlation to many developmental problems mainly fetal alcohol syndrome and mental retardation and even other diseases such as diabetes and cancer but I do not think there is a strong enough correlation to ADHD. ,intj,d0qdkkr,1,t5_2qowo

6944467,0,t1_d13aexp,Id like to understand this better.So do you also fall victim to the ego stroking as well? Maybe it has something to do with our traits and natural arrogance.I consider myself fairly intelligent and I have been attracted to idiot girls in the past. The few girls Ive dated long term I wouldnt consider intellectual equals per se they were smarter in the ways I can be lacking. These parts that are lacking in me I hope I can learn from them.There was this one girl that was easily equal and far more educated than myself. I was actually intimidated! First time Ive been attracted to someones brain. She was similar with cold logic and a wit to her. I think she mightve been an INTP. But her social awareness wasnt as keen as others Ive dated. I understand the need to want to talk about more than sportsball or whatever but these men approached you in a bar setting? Perhaps they noped out because the conversation didnt fit the parameters of the environment? Just a thought. Believe me if I could cut through the crap of some of dumb girl conversations in bars.... I would. I think most people arent ready for real conversation the first second maybe by the third time of seeing someone.,intj,d13hhfb,5,t5_2qowo

I am honestly so horrible at understanding why certain things upset people and feel like a child when I get shit for being aloof and disinterested in other people especially if I think Im doing a good job of being emotionally intune and enjoyable. I can definitely be sociable and fun with some booze I love to dance and talk to people and be chatty since it gets me out of my head  but I am never going to be a lighthearted emotionally inclined person definitely not in the way that it is effortless for my FJ or SFP friends.

I dont feel like my emotional displays were rejected when I was a child and additionally I was a raised in a very loving household where my parents modeled an effective and healthy relationship to me.  So while some natural fear of closeness with people may exist within me I was shown from a young age that it was both possible to sustain an intimate relationships and beneficial to be in an intimate relationship.

If I am working on the computer I work for  minutes and take a  minute break.

7639395,0,t3_4js3yy,The last time I genuinely cried was earlier this week when I truly discovered that I was an INTJ and what it meant and that I was not alone. I had taken a personality test some years ago and gotten the result INTJ but didnt really bother reading much about it etc. It wasnt until this week that I actually started reading about it when I was close to reaching some kind of breaking point because of depression and worries about life. I have been trying for a couple of years to study law which I really didnt find very interesting. I felt that it was impossible for me to work hard with it considering that I found it so boring. I rather put my soul and hard work into my hobbies that I was actually interesed in and perfecting them. Thinking about the fact that studying and working with something I found as boring as law that just felt like any other kind of work only that I would make more money made me really depressed. It was my little brother who advised me to take the personality test again and read about my personality in order to maybe get a guideline for what I could do with my life instead. I was like meh alright man and so I did. When I started reading about my INTJ personality I felt like someone was reading my thoughts and telling my life story at the same time. There was nothing written there that I could not say were  spot on and it was almost a bit creepy. My emotions started to really build up but it was when I found a forum of INTJpeople who told about life experiences thoughts and such that were like exact replicas of mine that I really just burst out crying. I didnt really know why I started to cry so hard it felt like it came out of nothing.Later I tried to figure out what made me so emotional and I came to the following conclusion I have been feeling all my life that I was completely alone and completely unique in both good and bad ways and have been feeling that there was not a person on earth who could understand me if they tried. So discovering that I was not completely alone that there are people out there who are just like me that there is nothing wrong with me and so on really felt amazing. The feeling of this discovery was so great that it made me cry hard out of happiness. Never before in my life have I cried out of happiness. Not once.,intj,d3ak20q,3,t5_2qowo

7670305,0,t3_4kc8qb,I dont know how helpful thisll be but this is I suppose the reason I dont get sad about such things.The thing that underlies every single thing you said is that you suffer. You wonder what your purpose is but you seek the answer because you despair suffer that there might not be one. To me this seems to suggest that to be rid of suffering is the purpose. Everything else is just the method. Then when you realise that you then realise that suffering is beyond your own mind too and that you have no reason to assume its any different to yours. And so you have no reason to respond any differently to suffering in others simply because its in others. With that I have my purpose  to move the world as close as possible to the state of peace the absence of suffering. The way I choose to do it is to try and develop a philosophy of life that will help with emotional matters and the use of reason to make the other good decisions about how to minimise suffering.As for your passions they do bring a real sense of pleasure from life. You say that you cannot develop a passion because of you become cognizant that it is arbitrary. The question you need to ask yourself is Why does arbitrariness mean you should not enjoy it? What difference does it make? Suffering is suffering and pleasure is pleasure regardless of its source.On a closing note I strongly reccomend mindfulness meditation. Extended periods of meditation have given me a real glimpse of the kind of peace again absence of suffering that are possible and those experiences have shown me that a lot of our despairing thoughts dont really make a lot of senseare irrelevant.I truly hope Ive helped and that you can find some peace.,intj,d3e2idk,3,t5_2qowo

8098795,0,t1_d4he1bh,I have an INFJ spouse too.. we basically only have issues when I let my overly critical self make some comment on how shes accomplishing X. Whether shes being inefficient or basically inept I get annoyed and sometimes let my tongue slip. Its always better if I simply offer to help and use my inert skill at nearly everything to be actually useful to her. Inversely she can be difficult sometimes when she sees a problem and immediately reacts with emotion instead of trusting that I have everything under control and will deal with the issue at hand and be done with it.  sorry for being like a million years late in internet time...,intj,d4qdljx,1,t5_2qowo

Its far more succinct for a character in a movie to when he happily opens the door and sees a room full of faceeating zombies running towards him say fuck! than to explain the despair urgency and fear of the situation.Finally swear words have a rawness an honesty that conveys not only your emotion but the lack of pretense.  When I hear someone say Jeesy Pete or Oh fudge! I lose respect for them.  they want to say bad words without being bad.

It should also be said that I dont believe I fit your target audience if your target audience are musicians. The badI would invest in a better mic so you dont have to speak so unnaturally loud. Invest in better lighting and adjust camera settings I found it detracting the the background kept changing from blue to white to yellow and back again depending on where you were in relation to the camera. And on the topic of background add a little flair show us your decked out music room and show us your passion for it. Dont just sit in front of a blank wall.The topic was fairly interesting but you kept relating it to playing the trumpet which is fine if you are only trying to reach trumpet players. If you are trying to reach a wider audience relate to something that most people have in common like the bathroom and brushing your teeth. But keep the expanding on the same metaphor rather than jumping from one to another.Dont use air quotes. Ever.When you did use them you air quoted the word experts as to say they really arent and then go on to quote them like you believed the research. It was a little confusing unless there is another band joke in there that I didnt get.The goodYou seemed really enthusiastic about everything. That is something to keep up. No one in there right mind likes listening to the monotone teacher but it did seem that it was a little forced to me. Relaxing will come over time with practice so keep at it.You did speak very clearly and concisely for the most part like you knew exactly what you wanted to say and you didnt stutter.While I may not have gotten all the jokes I am sure many will. Dont lose them. But depending on the target audience you may want to tweak them a bit.All in all it was better than I would do. Just keep at it. And remember this is only my opinion.

When I view Trump and his antics it is not in the context of well Trump does this and Hillary does that and use it as a justification for support.You ask why not support Trump? When Trump is viewed independently on his own merit and views he is a nightmare. Example he spouts garbage to rile up his fan base yes fan base not voter base then a few hours later contradicts or straight out lies about what he previously stated.As I stated earlier I am not defending Clinton but it makes more sense to judge either candidate singularly not comparatively on their merits and shortcomings. Using Clintons weaknesses as justification to support Trump is not valid. Judge Trump for what he is standing on his own.Why am I saying this about Trump and not Clinton?

My friends who have been in similar situationsmindsets have found it very helpful.Community college is High School  Electric Boogaloo. If you had gotten out of the house been surrounded by people who share your interests hobbies and passions you might not feel the same way.High school left me jaded as hell. The most enjoyable class I had was AP calc and that left me with a sour taste in my mouth because I was literally sleeping through the lectures only doing my homework half the time so I could help a friend out with hers and was still the only one in the class getting an A before the final. My teacher wrote everyone letters at the end of the year and mine said Im sorry I couldnt make this harder for you.It sounds like living with your mom is a big part of the issue... not because she is pressuring you to do things you dont want to do but because you cant become an adult while you are still living with your mother. I fucking love my family and I still see them at least  once or twice a week Im  but it was clearly stated that I was going to go away to school even though I was offered a full ride for  years at our CC and not live at home because leaving the nest is part of a necessary transition into adulthood.You sound like you love to immerse yourself in your hobbies. Thats what university life is. You live and breathe your passions. My social life at school revolved around making sure I was inside the art building before the lockout so I could stay there til the AM hours painting sketching drawing designing and rendering with other people who LOVED the same shit I did.If you really dont have that much ambition and stay in school youll probably end up one of the millions with a diploma working a shitty job anyway. Or you can choose to work a shitty job now without wasting your time and money on a diploma. If you really do have some desire to build a career and produce some meaningful work or just not have to survive through penny pinching and this is just a temporary bit of depression... maybe you should consider seeing a therapist and consider leaving hove for an education you will actually care about.But hey what do I know?

8489797,0,t3_4vyj09,Im a male INTJ with more than my fair share of dating experience.This may not be the answer you want to hear but have you considered the possibility that he inst interested in you that way?  Its possible that he is oblivious to your advances but it is just as likely that he is fully aware of your flirtations and chooses to act like he is oblivious as to avoid a potentially awkward situation.  When a woman is hitting on me that im not interested I will usually act like I dont notice and hope they eventually give up.  Its more socially acceptable than crushing them by saying im not interested when all they have been doing is harmlessly flirting. You mentioned that you already asked him out. I presume he said no. Attraction usually doesnt change much for guys over time. If he wasnt interested then he probably isnt interested now. You may have become good friends and are now very close. That does not entail that he is also now attracted to you. Im just going off the limited information you have given me and you will be the better judge of the situation.

I even once accidentally kissed him on the shoulder as we were getting out of the shower and in my mind despite all the intimate fun wed had for weeks I knew in my head that this accidental kiss meant a lot to me. I didnt let on he seemingly ignored it and we carried on with our conversation. Weeks later when I confessed my feelings for him he brought up the kiss on the shoulder and said he  had known since then. He explained that as slight a gesture as it was he sensed a lot of weight behind it.

I get really freaked out and will flee the coop if guys Ive dated for less than six months start talking about marriage and children.Also OP I just want to add that your post reminds me a lot of an exboyfriend I broke up with because he was too controlling. He often offered advice to me that was goodintentioned but was neither asked for nor useful and he always took it personally and threw tantrums if I didnt just enthusiastically accept it.

I literally told her to stop and its about respect unless its emergency. After  or  dates it was okay then it comes back again. . Its not just about the birthday even tho she had no intention to make an effort to arrange another date. Its just in general her lack of interestcaring to my life makes me question what did I do wrong to deserve sth like this?  . Yep just be fair. Tried to point them out eventually she just told me equally doesnt apply in relationship I was like WTF. Sad to hear about this... What do you think about the reasons behind cheating? . The disappointment is real... makes ppl stop making plans with them in the picture but then I will be blamed for not taking initiatives ironically gt All in all I found my relationship with the ENFP pretty fulfilling and a source of intense emotional growth.

8668890,0,t1_d6ov1ze,How does one stay in a five year long relationship and only decide its not been working out after four years come on.    If you dont know what you want from a relationship after so many years then maybe its high time to realize you are not right in the head and you are wasting not only yours but someone elses time by keeping them invested emotionally.    Judging from her other posts she was the one to breakup which only makes it so much frigging worse in my eyes. She keeps on saying on how it was her exs fault on all accords but to me it seems like she made no efforts on her own to spice the relationship up if she was so dissatisfied with it. Either that or she wasnt able to speak up after again bloody four years of knowing someone. Come the hell on youve been together for four and a half years talk with each other about problems like grownups do something on your own initiative and dont go off chasing more tempting options the moment they arrive. If you do then what the hell were the last  and half years for?    Should have known better after a few months or a year dont you think. The honeymoon phase dies before this period and you should be able to tell whether you will have an enjoyable future with that particular someone or not so if she had doubts a year into the relationship then why the hell did she string along for years and years.    Bloody convenient and quite easy to make oneself the victim without really giving other pieces of the story.    Answering your question nope in a relationship doing well but I just fail to understand that this woman is in her honeymoon phase after what seemed to be a relationship full of resentment and shitty communication. Sure enjoy the moment but dont go saying the world is cruel and there is no true love when the honeymoon phase ends this reeks way too much of emotional instability and delusions of some grandiose love.    She is now getting what she had been missing for the past year. But she has not told us why that particular spiciness was not present in her past relationship because I am sure as hell it was there during the honeymoon phase it always is in every single relationship. She says the past year was boring and not developing for her as person but where is the other side of story hm?    Maybe she sucked at communicating her own needs maybe she wasnt putting in any effort to spice things up maybe she was dismissive of her boyfriends attempts to try something new. Fuck no Im not going to feel loveypity for someone who turns themselves into a victim without providing proof of being one.,intj,d6p8cer,2,t5_2qowo

8769542,0,t3_506jjr,To answer your question it depends. I actually was in a situation very similar to his I got out of a relationship that was  and  years long and I met a girl a month later.For me and others  its an extended period of mental and physical chemistry that decides. We have to laugh with each other at least agree on some things but talk like adults about things we dont agree on. Healthy relationships are always built on healthy friendships and I think many of us INTJs try that first we want to know what were getting into and what to expect. Also I have to want to be with her physically and she cant be stupid I cant deal with a woman without a brain.I knew when I couldnt get her out of my head. I spent every day thinking about her and how I wanted to learn more. Thr more I learned about who she was the more I wanted to know. After about a month of spending next to everyday with her knowing her and trusting her I knew she was right for me. Weve been together  months now and things couldnt be better.Also from the beginning I made it very clear that I was interested but I didnt know enough to make a decision yet. Like he did.The main point is that if he is an INTJ hell likely feel out the situation before he makes a commitment. If he can see himself with you long term hell go for it. And hell be very clear with you when hes made that decision. But it will take time.However I need to express my concern about something you mentioned he said. Please clarify if this isnt what you meant.If he can do whatever he wants while on this stage and  you cant do whatever you want drop him like the deuce he is. You are equal with him and if you cant see anyone else then neither can he. You should NEVER agree to that arrangement. That isnt how healthy relationships work or start. Overlooking that do your best to be patient and continue to learn about each other. Youll know when its time.,intj,d71uvcn,3,t5_2qowo

With that being said I landed on the INTJ label myself but my IE is close to  so I slip back and forth between the roles depending on whats going around me and how capable I am in handling it. No one label is going to define you as a person. Members on this forum like to wear INTJ as a badge of honor but its really just people trying to handle issues in new and creative ways.

Youre probably not even smarter INTJs are good at intelligence tests because the tests are particularly well suited to our preferred method of problem solving NOT because we are smarter than other types. We are not. Ive been in a similar place to where you are. Luckily I realized earlier that Im not as smart as everyone kept going on about me being. And from that realization Ive managed to cut out a weirdly normal life. So. Decide what you want your life to look like. Do you want friends? If so give people the benefit of the doubt and be nice to them and keep doing that until you meet people you genuinely like. This does not require that you like them up front only that you are civil and that you make the effort to interact. Over time you can go from answering peoples questions to asking your own. Work is a good place to develop these skills because there are rules for social conduct in the workplace. Ive also found it hard to get along with much less befriend women in the past and am just starting to get over this now that Ive met a few women that I have a lot of respect for. Sometimes its hard to find people you respect even when you can find individual qualities you respect in others. Id say keep looking because getting over what is basically sexism will make your life better.,intj,d81itqk,2,t5_2qowo

9248290,0,t3_56z79s,INTJ female married to a ISFP male.ampnbspOur first meetup we had that chemistry which was special to me but my husband keeps saying thats how he is to people. Maybe it was something about INTJs being attracted to ISFPs? I dont know not much facts for me to back this up aside from a few Reddit posts.ampnbspAfter that day despite our chemistry my husband was reluctant to pursue me due to a few reasons one mainly being the fact that I broke up  months before we met and he was afraid that my ex might come and patch things up with me. So I pursued him I was the one who texted him first thru our mutual friend. From there things start to happen. But from the dating to being in a relationship process it took time. Both of us sorted our baggage from our individual previous bad relationships together. He settled mine I settled his.ampnbspAfter that came a confession period and I was the one who initiated it. I cant remember how it went but I believe I asked him what is going on and where is this going because I dont wanna waste time on something that is not worth the time if I can remember correctly that was what I said. He too confessed and I think from then on our love story blossomed to be a good year of sweet story with rough patches here and there.ampnbspWe got married a year later got a kid another year later and now going thru rough tough patches. Its rocky right now but everytime I tell anyone about how me and husband started off it makes me believe this marriage will work somehow.ampnbspThe reason for me to recount my story To demonstrate that us as an INTJ can go up to them to clarify things. Plus to let you know of my own experience of INTJ and ISFP pairing especially on how we began.ampnbspOn how my story can relate to yours and what you can do about yoursampnbspgtEssentially I dont know what to do in this situation.Find ways on how you can approach her. Understand her dominant Fi well and know that her Fi will cause her to feel feelings strongly but unable to express it well especially when it comes to an attraction.ampnbspgtIf I do ask her do the feelings go over at all?It may or it may not. Try to talk things out logically. One thing I learn from my husband he is capable of logical talk just that his Fi emotions can really impact his logic. Go the logic way. Like one of the redditors mention Express your feelings first and make yourself vulnerable amp do not put the onus on her. Tell her what you told us that you feel Its like a wrench in my gut churning and churning about her.ampnbspgtCan one still be friends after such an ordeal?I cannot give you a guarantee. Just think of it this way will you regret one day that you do not at least let her know?ampnbspgtDo you have any experiencetips that might help? I appreciate any kind of response.IF this goes onto a relationship be aware of NiFi loop from both of you. Its truly nasty when both goes thru the loop at the same time.ampnbspps these are from my own personal experiences others may go thru different experiences as an INTJ and ISFP pairing.,intj,d8oaekk,1,t5_2qowo

But then I end up with lots of unfinished projects. I have the tools and possibly capability but I never get to actually doing anything with it. I think its the easy we live. The age of information overhaul. Just want a simple life with few things to do. Being practical. I keep telling myself that I just cant do it all its impossible.

I have a pretty high sex drive a decent social game and Im conventionally attractive so it was a pretty easy thing for me to do. However these days Im interested in something a little more permanent.

9420131,0,t1_d99q6an,Well youre basically restarting the whole entire phrase once again... Your input on whether or not you would be in a relationship or not shouldnt be concerning. It was due to the fact of giving this chick advice which everyone has told her to move on and even YOU yourself are confessing that If it were me. I wouldnt be in A relationship to begin with if I were going to be selfish about it and have a me first mentality Basically saying If YOU were HER then you wouldnt be in  relationship to begin with because SHE is acting selfish and needy Oh honey.. dont sugarcoat it by the way youre possibly the worst intj in this planet if you arent going to be logical and direct about how you KNOW shes needy and should move on. Be real.Ah well... im not in a relationship anyways and no you werent being considerate to her since youre promoting her misery to even tell her basically Yeah let this guy continue to have fun while he ignores you even though hes  aware that you arent happy OH YEAH GIVE ME THAT ATTENTION is basically what youre telling her to do and to continue to do so while she still tries to bother people on why her relationship with her INTJ boyfriend isnt working.Because.. its not. Its not working her boyfriend is shit and shes in such an delusional state and tries to justify the fact that its going to work on her part. Its not. Its really not. Other people say its not im also saying its not and she herself should stop doubting herself that its not either. Obviously its not her so maybe its time for her to put some logic sense that she should move on and find someone who would care about losing her IF anything. Lastly this isnt a post I posted on the INTJ subreddit.

9496132,0,t1_d9is517,Yup  you sure are a piece a shit why  because you think you are.  Those who think of themselves as worthless are worthless.  Your brain actually hates to dissapoint it turns out.     So go do something.  Stop beleiving your worthles  because only worthless people are worthless.  Accomplish something small  that now is what you are worth.  Do more things  you are worth more.  Id argue  at a year behind you I too am worthless but  I have ability to acheive  and damn right I will go grab that and pull something from it and make myself not worthless.     If you dont know where life is going take a step back from all your pressures once you are done school. Why dont you try something diffeent with your life  see if you can try to be a labourer on some farm somewhere.  Hell if you think you will physchically handle it join the army. Do something for pay truly different from anything youve done that will provide skills for the future.     So you have no friends? What do you like doing irl? Go do that.  I love playing smash bros  I go to tournaments  and have made friends there. But acting doom and gloom will never make you friends  because I sure as hell dont want to be around that guy.    Beleive it or not  if you live on to fix your life and live with a postive mindset  you will eventually make a differnce to somebody  with a sentance that actually might save a life  become a supportive friend that improves somebodys life  or through whatever work you discover make small improvements to the lives of many  while also satisfying yourself.     What does killing yourself accomplish? Nothing.  Absolute jack shit. Hell  as far as we know it could be a nothing   or hell. I know I want my full life to figure where I stand on religion. I will mention here that I am a Christian     But lets say there is no hell  where suicide has no possible punishment. Except maybe it does. How is your relationship with your parents? If its  not good but not bad  maybe even if you think they wont care  itll probably still crush them to know that theyll never get the opportunity to mend that relationship. Life is about you. But to get the meaning out of it you really do have to realize that its not about only about you  its also about those who care abput who  and those who you will benefit  oftentimes without even expending any effort of your own.     Are you sure nobody cares? Are you sure theres nobody in yoyr life your not currently close to  but might want yo be closer  and do care any aunts  uncles  cousins?     Suicide is selfish. It only helps you And will most likely hurt others. But will it help you? What if you are on the cusp of improving yourself for the better  you just need to realize it and take opportunity by the throat. And i should mention  most who fail suicide barely  such as surving their bridge jump or somehow surving their nuce realize their insanity on the way down  and say that they desperately want back in on life  realize that they indeed do want it  but sometimes it takes the realization that you are indeed mortal  and indeed dead to regret suicide. Dont be that guy who succeeds but has his revelation. Youll regret it eternally... For all of  seconds.     If yoy need  go to therapy and get help tell your therapist if you can though to do everything in his power to not use pills however  they have have a terrible failure rate.  Ever considered you need something to live for  whether it be a dog  people depending on you  your job  or somewhere you volunteer. Make something need or benefitted by you  sometimes people need that. Now somebody please expand on my fragmented thoughts of fi?  but my finger is tired of typing and i like sleep.

INTJs generally make decisions fast and dont need all the information. Its efficient and we love efficiency. We discard unnecessary clutter and filter out only the concentrated truth. We love making decisions and getting things over with.The single letter difference is deceiving because the two types share no cognitive functions. I suggest you familiarize yourself with them. INTJs and INTPs collect and process information in very different ways and its not as simple as J vs P. This article may offer some insight into their deeper differences.,intj,d9ly7ow,5,t5_2qowo

I really cant say if Id recommend it I chose it because cooking and biology were both always my biggest passions since I was like  years old and had to cook on my own. Its alot of hard work and you have to really dedicate yourself to be good at it. If you got no cooking skills whatsoever you should propably first look for an internship to see if you even like it instead of just jumping into it and become burned out after  months. good chefs got a feel for the food they are creating its called culinary ARTS for a reason. you need to find out if you got the the foundation to develop a feel for it.edit but if you do choose it and do well in it you will learn things that not only help you at work but also at life at home life in general. also the job market for a chef is really good. people are always gonna eat.,intj,d9r4kuc,1,t5_2qowo

Socks are a good idea. I might go to Costco for a pack of those warm Kirkland ones so I can hand them out next time Im downtown.

If they tell me they need a bus ticket and theyre going the same direction as me Id probably buy them a ticket and get on the train with them. unfortunately buying someone a ticket without heading the same way just means the ticket is likely to be resold on the spot for cheaper so thats just like asking for money. Its not about the money its about knowing Im doing a good thing. If Im helping someone eat thats great. If Im supporting a drug habit I feel like that makes me a bad person.

If you miss something which you will it will be a source of guilt and more work will have to be done since you have to reschedule everything on your list. Instead create todo lists that have no particular order time or priority unless absolutelt necessary. Only have tasks you are truly going to do. This smooths the process over.Decide on next actions  This one is from David Allens Getting things done. If theres something like buy girlfriend a christmas gift or apply to college on your list but you havent decided on a gift or dont know the next step in the application process it creates some congnitive dissonance because there is still something that needs to be decided. Better list items would be surf the web for ideas about gift for girlfriend or visit college website and create application checklist If you cant DO the thing on your list it creates tension as you still have to decide what to do.Activation energy  If you dont want to do it now youll never want to do it. So either do it now put it on your list to do as soon as you have a moment or dont do it at all. The hardest part of any task is always the first step. As an INTJ its really easy to rationalize all of the reasons that something doesnt HAVE to be done right now. But  since youll never feel more inclined to do that than you do right now or a day after the due date  whoops  ignore that reasoning. All of that rational takes up valuable brain power and is a constant source of guilt and uncertainty.This is coming from a  year old who dropped out of college and got bitch slapped by life.

Remember Hinduism has historically been used to justify the caste system of India and I mean no offense to my Indian compatriotsthere are just as bad examples in Western philosophy but ultimately any idea is more important with regards to how you use it than the actual theory behind it ex anarchism is great in theory horrendous in application.Also I suggest seeking professional counseling if your issues do not resolve in what you feel is a reasonable amount of time.

So you have issues from your family. Its not love what youre feeling but rather an obsession for the love that you didnt get from your parents when the time was right. You are not in love with him as a person but with the image of your parents that you see in him. You are projecting your own need for love onto him. This pattern will likely happen with your next boyfriend as long as he behaves similar to how you parents behaved when you were young.What you can do right now is to accept that you can never get back the love that your parents didnt give you in the first place. Instead accept yourself for who you are. And also listen to your counselor.,intj,dbf793m,9,t5_2qowo

But the source of him being that way by saying those things is he was probably in a prior relationship which allowed him to discover himself and learn about women and relationships. And I speak this from experience. I just ended a  year relationship with an ENFJ because of the neediness and overall change of attitude that she showed during the last  months before ending. Nevertheless I definitely consider the relationship to be overall fruitful. I learned so much and I developed my emotional support and intelligence. Im unafraid to approach any woman I find attractive unless shes in a big group of women lol.

10234165,0,t3_5mi0mi,Note that desiring to be an INTJ is a phrase and concept with quite negative connotations  there are quite a few people who go around trying to squeeze themselves into the INTJ definition or even want to become INTJ viewing it as some sort of gold medal of character rather than a description of how some people just happen to function whether they like it or not. INTJ are objectively no better than any other type of person INTJ are different from each other while also similar you should aim to be proud of yourself no matter what your native personality is named in some random persons analytical theory. That said I also questioned my type between INTJ and INTP in the beginning until I had been thoroughly reading about the functions and discussing with both other INTJ and people of other types for a while. I would recommend reading articles on every function and every type preferrably from nonhoroscopic sources including the ones furthest from you  you may gain the understanding of the functions that you need. Ignore the tests they are nothing compared to understanding the functions. It also helped me that I have a very clearcut INTP sibling to relate to while I know no other INTJ in real life  perhaps it would help you to discuss personally with an INTP or INTJ as well? Or to read various writings online by INTP and INTJ to analyse how they think if you have none to rely on IRL. Im a little interested in your motivation for buying this shirt before youre sure of your type. Who is it that you want to start conversations with you over a shirt? Friends strangers? Do you find it easy to participate in random conversations with strangers  and is it easy to converse about anything or does it make a big difference to you that there is a topic within your sphere of interest the INTJ label on your shirt that is the basis of the conversation? Do you enjoy socialising does it make you very tired after relatively short amounts of time? What are your feelings about small talk and social theatricals social norms? In my personal experience as I now know Im a rather clearcut INTJ just as my sibling is a clearcut INTP the fact that you fell in love and dated would hint that youre not an INTP unless this girl invaded your personal space and hit you repeatedly in the head until you realised maybe you liked her in your life a little bit yet what does it eat? and where will it sleep?. Im joking however I will also note that your romance doesnt particularly hint towards you being an INTJ either. You fell in love you are you that girl was that girl two people of the same type can be as different as day and night thus her type or your type does not mean much. ,intj,dc43lq6,1,t5_2qowo

10333247,0,t3_5nwy8a,. Do you have exceptional mathematical skills? eg Be able to calculate numbers easily without using a calculator. Or just look at a pattern of numbers and know which one follows in succession?Math is definitely my strongest asset. Im currently a high school freshman taking AP Stats. Im also a decent programmer which takes a fairly similar skillset.. Can you remember smells or sounds from memory? In addition can you remember the sense of touch?Not touch or smells. I can recall sounds but not especially well.. Can you recognize faces if you saw the pictures of the same person again?I can generally tell if Ive seen a person before but matching names with faces is a nightmare.. Which are your favorite movies? Is there a particular genre you like more than others?To be honest Im really not a fan of movies in general. I tend to find that Id much rather be participating in something interactive. On a bit of a tangential side note Before finding out I had aphantasia I always wondered why people got so upset about characters in movies not looking as they had imagined them when reading the book.. Which year or decade were you born in? You can just say the decade if you dont want to give our your specific birth year eg   s etcEarly s. Do you find it is easier to talk to someone on the phone or to see them in person?Its probably easier in person but there isnt a huge difference.. Would you rather create something new like say write something from scratch or do you find you rather recite what youve read before?I love creating new things. Anything remotely creative mostly comes down to stealing someone elses work and slightly modifying it but I always want to end up with something that appears to be unique.. Are you good at building things with your hands? Lets say you are assembling a complicated piece of furniture do you need to look at the manual to be able to do it?I hate reading manuals so I usually just struggle through figuring it out myself even when it really isnt necessary. Im decent at figuring out how to put things together but some furniture can be a nightmare to put together.. Are you good at sports? And if you play sports which sport do you like?Not especially. I run crosscountry and golf but I dont have a lot of natural talent everything has to be practiced a lot before I become any good at it.. Would you rather play a videogame or read a comic book?I generally find works of fiction to be a bore fiction books movies comic books etc. Id always rather be doing something interactive like playing a game.. Any other thing you want to add about yourself.The only way I can think is through an internal monologue. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed theres a voice inside my head which is processing everything I think about. This voice often comes out in the form of a very quiet whisper. Also Im quite introverted Id be interested to see if theres a correlation between Aphantasia and Introversion.,intj,dcfbxge,2,t5_2qowo

10520865,0,t1_dd0mgfd,gt As for whether or not my response was similar to Clinton Bush or Obama no because I was young enough that I wasnt paying attentionThats fair nough as someone who started paying attention early let me tell you this The media never made a big deal of normal transition practices with a Democrat president.I live in New England. I grew up with snowy winters and thunderstormy summers. About a decade or so ago weather news changed. They went sensational. Six inches of snow predicted! Its the SNOWPOCALYPSE! We dont even shovel for six inches. Heavy thunderstorms coming your way! Better batten down the hatches! Theyre coming from the Northwest! They always come from the Northwest. If they dont worry. Over time I learned to read the forecasts check the radar and I picked up on a bit of elementary meteorology because if I didnt judge for myself whether a given storm was severe I would be running around every day like a chicken with my head cut off.In recent years the news media has been much the same overreporting things that they think will get people angry while ignoring things that either wont rile folks or will present information that they dont really want made highly public. Ive learned to hold on and listen wait figure things out. Never trust the first economic reports coming out check for the revised version. Wait to hear the second side of a story. The more frenetic and panicked they sound the more likely that its not a big deal. The big deals happen in the background. Theres a quote from one of Sir Terry Pratchetts books A lie can run around the world twice before the Truth gets its boots on.gt You might do yourself a favor to remember that many people who do not support Trump have suspicions about what his intents are and how his presidency is going to play out so when he does things that confirm these suspicions its troubling.I dont and didnt support Trump and I didnt vote for him. See above for the reason why I didnt immediately join the OMG brigade and why I bothered to wait until I heard from the head of the EPA instead of a couple of random people who are obviously biased in their view of Trump to begin with.I got the measure of Trump from his present and past statements his previous behaviors etc. and though its nothing like what many of his supporters project upon him it also isnt anywhere near as insane and unstable as his enemies are trying to spin. I did a similar thing with Obama and was unsurprised by most of what he did in office. I started with W Bush. Actually I started with Clinton. I just didnt begin to really trust my intuitionbasedongathereddata until partway through Obamas  presidency. Thats another reason why with this as with several things that Obama did I waited for the rest of the story.gt Also plenty of conservatives were raking Obama over the coals the entire  years of his presidency.But generally you didnt get the major news media trying to spin everything he did down to the most routine things that people didnt know about because they havent even been mentioned before to make him look like they need for him to look for the sake of their news cycle.gtIm not sure what point youre trying to make with that last comment it comes with the territory.Im hoping I misread you there and you werent actually trying to tell me that either being called racist for opposing nonracial policy decisions made by a black man comes with the territory of not being a liberal Democrat or that being able to dismiss opponents with the race card if you are nonwhite comes with the territory of being a liberal Democrat...Im guessing youre talking about some other kind of last comment or something.,intj,dd0njkp,4,t5_2qowo

10901107,0,t3_5vri5p,Pride is a useful tool when it is used in the correct way.  Used correctly pride allows you to selfidentify with and thus maintain your virtues in the face of outside and internal pressures to the contrary.  The term virtues is here defined in the Ayn Rand sense aspects of character that allow you to achieve material goods or spiritual goods.  Goods in turn are defined as those things which we act to gain and keep and which our survival depends upon.  For example I take pride in my capacity for self control.  Self control is a virtue... it provides me with the ability to apply and deny the products of my various other virtues according to my conscious intent.  As such it is in fact the core metavirtue that all other virtues must depend upon.  It is therefore right for my to be proud of my great capacity for self control and the action of that pride is to identify with my own capacity for self control and thus to act to reinforce my motivation to maintain and hone my self control.  So pride is a virtue and an important one.  It is the emotional pump in the virtuous cycle by which any virtue reinforces and maintains itself.  Pride ceases to be a useful tool when it is directed at something that is not within ones self or not intrinsically a virtue or indeed even a vice.  Pride in a nonvirtue such as being lucky so far or in vices causes the prideful person to missvalue real virtues.  Since virtues are the characteristics that let you acquire goods that ultimately your survival depends upon missvaluing them is a selfdestructive path.  A similar missvaluing happens as a result of pride in things that are goods that are the result of virtues rather than the virtues that gave rise to those goods the virtues are a part of you whereas the goods be they material for example shelter or spiritual for example friendship are outside of you.  For example it is inappropriate to be proud of ones property.  At best the property represents the wealth of a person and his taste or skill in the selection or the crafting of the property...  The wealth is at best a product of his virtues assuming he acquired his wealth honourably and the taste and skill are virtues... these are things he would be justified in having pride in but the actual property is not a part of him and thus not an appropriate object of pride.  Pride when applied to an object outside oneself acts to cause the prideful person to value that object higher than the virtues that put it in his ownership... again selfdefeating.  Concerning Arrogance that is a function of self control applied back to pride.  If you find that your pride is becoming a problem either socially of mentally then first ask if it is being correctly applied to actual virtues see above.  If not rectify your egoboundaries and sense of self until you take pride only in things that are properly parts of you and which work toward your own good AKA virtues.  If so then apply self control on the expression of your pride to others and its influence on your actions until the requisite humility for the circumstance is achieved.  Note how pride is driving selfcontrol through the virtuous cycle and self control as directed by realtime conscious choice is in turn moderating pride.  Interlocking and consciouslyregulated feedback loops like that are in my opinion the hallmark of a well organized mind.,intj,de4de6w,6,t5_2qowo

11123546,0,t3_5ypzhr,It is INTJs or Ni habit to proclaim a conclusion without first giving other people enough context and evidence. That is just how our Ni works it absorbs a huge deal of information and suddenly give us a revelation whenever it feels like it has connected everything together to draw out a big picture. This process is quite subconscious so its hard to explain it to others. So if we want to convince others in the orthodox INTJ way then Im afraid we may have to practice laying out everything in a methodological manner like how we write a book or give a lecture. There is also the NTPs way to deal with this problem they dont state a definite point or a conclusion at the beginning. They suggest a topic then let their opponent makes argument by asking the opponent to elaborate. Then they deconstruct the other persons argument and point out any logical inconsistency. When their opponents argument is shredded into about a thousand pieces they will present their logical conclusion from the discussion. This way they are the attacker and dont have to come up with a lot of examples to protect their stand. They are also good practice partners if you manage to win over an NTP you can win over anyone since they are all hardcore skeptics.Also its good to keep in mind that some types for example Se dominant type wont listen to you until they experience things firsthand. I suggest you leave those people alone.tldr Instant agreement doesnt exist and every NT experiences what you described at some point. But as Nidominants INTJs are actually quite negligent in making comprehensive foolproof argument. Solution is either we get over our laziness or revert our role in the discussion to be the one attacking others position.,intj,desuf5u,3,t5_2qowo

Both of those issues can be tied to your lack of friends.I dont want to waste my time either and yes I spend most of my free time with the friends I feel return the most investment for my time. Still saying you dont want to waste your time on the overwhelming majority of people  seems to be a conservative estimate implies you think most people are worthless which ultimately reflects how you feel about your own self worth.  You can be unnaturally selfconfident while also having little to no self esteem. I once heard confidence is believing in your own ability arrogance is the disbelief in other peoples capabilities.

You will probably not be able to do it by being social and exiting. Try to improve your potential strengths. We INTJs tend to be confident and even if we are not socially confident we can change that. Try to use your natural confidence and intelligence to make yourself attractive. You also have to play the social game and follow the social rules if you want to climb up in the social dominance hierarchy which you will need to do if you want to get girls.Edit You will need to be somewhere over the bottom of the hierarchy if you want a girlfriend and you need to be high in the hierarchy if you want a girlfriend while maintaining your high standards.,intj,dffajjl,7,t5_2qowo

11373685,0,t1_dfkymbx,To make a system where people are unaware that they are in the system is very hard. Rather than even discussing difficulty you could just discuss rarity. Systems like those are just super rare to find and the whole system has to be made from the ground up with that one concept in mind. Now personally i find that interesting and i believe any INTJ would enjoy trying to make such a system. But generally people will either want to know what system they are interacting with or they will just find out over time or on accident. Nonetheless thats a cool concept and sound counterargument. But back to what my main point was anyway. Dont get me wrong the Does it work check is very useful and I wont act like i dont use it and solely rely on it. But whether or not is actually does work might depend on my mood current knowledge at the time and my environment. Basically the answer to the does it work might change in simply a week or even less. If the system doesnt work then i suppose you could just not stress over it but i always strive for perfection zero flaws. I agree with what you say about faith but the whole point in that quote is that faith might just interfere with achievement much more than how well you did said achievement. At this point i feel as if i am wholeheartedly defending faith though and that just sort of bugs me. I am not saying having faith in your system is always more important than making a flawless system. I am just saying the psychology plays a role into your success more than many INTJs might give credit to. Does it work obviously comes first. But if you are constantly doubting that it works despite being proven wrong time and time again you are directly making the system less effective. Except in the case that you provided but as i already said those are quite rare and most systems arent made to be concealed in such a manner. ,intj,dfl6qfb,1,t5_2qowo

11558301,0,t1_dg44sl9,Precisely essentially the DunningKruger effect applied to philosophy. Its astonishingly similar to zero point or perpetual motion machine creators hmm theres a correlation there... In each case the creator ignores broad swaths of established theory and focuses on simplistic mis interpretations of classical figures to burnish their position. Just as importantly the creator preemptively attacks the experts in the field further burnishing their position with their anti intellectual following. The beauty of this approach is that any criticism by qualified experts is rejected as the the actions of the central villains of the narrative.  This also burnishes the lack of expertise of the creator in that they are not tainted by the evil of the established order.  Finally the assertion it cant be a theory in that it is nonfalsifiable offers an incredibly desirable result I can suck all the energy out of the air I want I can be completely selfish!The final similarity is that the absence of any large scale implementations is due to interference. Attempts to put the perpetual motion machine in a calorimeter or measure the output with a trueRMS voltmeter suppresses the effect and is likely sabotage by the hated experts! In the same fashion a Randian utopia is supressed by the existence of governments regulation and insufficiently enlightened psychopaths.

11564761,0,t1_dg5m7sm,I think your questions and answers were a good throwback for me. I havent had any people to talk to about deep theological stuff in a long time. I think where we differ most on this subject is you are all about protection of the innocent and fairly good people. I am bent towards justice and vengeance. It took a long time for me to understand Gods grace and mercy because of my natural inclination to desire justice. In actuality Id be going to Hell if God only cared about justice. I think there is another option we havent considered that much in detail.  Instead of option A killing them B imprisoning them C letting them continue on with no interference There is option D. They are kept away from the fairly good people thus protecting them and they have to provide services to society. Some prisons still have these programs. But they pretty much have to do public service everyday that benefits society and pays for their upkeep. This way the fairly good people arent paying for them to continue living and these evil people are forced to outweigh the negative effects theyve had on society as much as possible.

I want a girl who wants to watch the program with me and talk about deep topics not everyone likessay existentionalism.Im not saying there are zero longterm materials on the dating apps naturaly i cant even claim that.

11680555,0,t1_dgjygdt,Then i guess where our results differ so did the approach. Its not like ive never failed though ive picked fights and split long lasting friendships during my time in college. To put it bluntly it felt quite shitty to end a  year friendship.I bounced back because i had the notion that there were so many new people to meet which would equate to so many things to learn. It wasnt as much as a leap of faith as anyone else might have thought.I do not wish to have it at your expense but do you mind sharing what youve experienced?,intj,dgk0a6j,1,t5_2qowo

11687280,0,t1_dgkr9ar,Valid point. The fools who pushed this myth of needing someone to compliment or balance out your personality were pulling everything out of their asses.

11694801,0,t3_66v06y,After always working in customer service and hating it I made the switch. I am a commercial electrician. I am so glad I made the switch. It is very fulfilling. The field is soooo amazingly broad that if you get tired of one niche there are  others. What another user said about making more money in white collar jobs vs blue collar isnt exactly true. As an Electrician you forge your own path. If you choose the right niches you can make crazy money. Some will require overtime and travelmaking k a year doing electrical on a new oil rig install traveling to an area that just had a natural disaster and repairing the electrical grid I hear can net you tens of thousands in just a few weeks systems automation and control work in a factory can net you k a year. I am still in my apprenticeship but I think I will be going more the systems automation and control route. It is way more forgiving on your body and the pay is nice. The story my master told me is when he was working at a factory in Michiganhe said something about factories in Michigan needing a Master Electrician on site or something. It was a fruit processing plant. He had  automation guys on staff each making between k a year. Basically they installed and monitored systems that would automatically clean the equipment every night. So you still get some install work and then it is a fair amount of computer work programming the systems using software. ,intj,dglmh3d,12,t5_2qowo

11710683,0,t3_672hga,Side note a year ago you were saying you cant ask about his love languages with your INTJ for he would find it silly or not useful.Instead call it Love Vocabulary with him.  You are agreeing on a common set of words that resonate with him and he finds these words to be a better communication tool than other words you can use in your Love Vocabulary.  You then present the  forms as these are the  common ways of expressing love in a vocabulary sense.  So do any of these  resonate with you or would you want to add a th one.By giving him the choice of adding a th one where he does not feel constrained by the  choices and he can think and reflect but most importantly search his memory and feel he will then respond with his th option while at the same time thinking about the  options you already gave him.  He will now see oh he does connect to some of those  Love Vocabulary choices and he can add a th or he can make the  choices you gave him that were technical and non personal into his personal way of saying these things resonate with me.Good Luck with your INTJ we are a crazy bunch sometimes I wonder if we are worth the trouble we make other types go through when they are in love with us but we are not in the same place they are ...I probably can say this paragraph better I think I am saying it well enough you can understand but I would like your opinion and feedback ,intj,dgnfoud,1,t5_2qowo
11711550,0,t1_dgniba3,gt Socializing with ENFPs is like socializing with yourself. Um yeah thats what YOU think about it. But not every INTJ.Male ISTJs and ENTJs who think theyre INTJs because theyre in STEM fields and and alienate people arent actually INTJs. Alternatively ESFPs are unbearably annoying and ENFJs are cool but really clingy and too grouporiented.Ive never ever met a real NiTe who doesnt feel exactly like that about real NeFis and I really know a ton of real INTJs. NidomNedom brain sex is the real deal its just ENFP and INTJ are both prone to mistyping from quite a few different directions.Honestly I think like  of this sub is just male ISTJs and  of renfp is ESFPs. Its usually pretty easy to spot the actual Ni and Ne doms too.,intj,dgnj843,1,t5_2qowo
11712635,0,t3_674kfy,You should avoid it only if it interferes excessively with your daily functioning and identity. This does not mean you build the great wall of china between yourself and others. Thats how you get anxiety depression isolation etc.Perception like that is uncomfortably useful a doubleedged sword. If you dont want to get lost in the ocean find your own lighthouse and go to it when you tread too far into others. Perform a self evaluation. What would I do in that situation? How would I react? That should focus and change your line of thought and refocus the lens on you not them.,intj,dgnnnd4,2,t5_2qowo
11719873,0,t3_677zrf,Most of the time when Ive experienced Deja Vu its been a fleeting moment and I just went what the? that was weird sometimes it was because I had in fact experienced a very similar situation before.One time I recall I did have persistent Deja Vu for the course of an evening I think it was about an hour or two. I think it was brought on by being tired and tense but it might have also been that I just happened to have a very similar evening a while back and forgotten about it. Anyway I was just chilling doing my laundry and planning my University subjects and everything I did felt like Id done it before as if I was reenacting a memory. Everything seemed very dim like there was a haze around the edges of my vision and I felt dissociated from my body I still saw through my eyes but it was like my actions were automatic or I knew what was going to come next before it did. I tried to do things to get a grip but whatever I did I was sure that Id already done it in the same situation at some point in the past. Ultimately I got too tired and went to bed and I was fine when I fell asleep. Later the next day I found some notes Id made planning my Uni timetable and I thought to myself thats it I felt like itd happened before because I had done those things before but then when I thought about it I couldnt remember if those notes were from a week ago and I had actually planned my timetable twice or if Id written them the previous night and forgotten.,intj,dgoh5g3,1,t5_2qowo
11727089,0,t1_dgp6erg,In DuncSullys defense helping yourself understand the thought process of others will ultimately benefit yourself in the end. If I can make everyone like me instead of being the person that cant be understood now I can become the person that understand others. And maybe all everyone ever wants is simply to be understood. To answer your question though most INTJs are concerned about growth. MBTI allows us to work on our flaws so we can keep growing intellectually wiser and eventually make better decisions. We strive to help everyone we care about to have better lives. This is almost a subconscious goal that also gives us fulfilment. So in a way it is still sort of selfish. ,intj,dgpao3b,15,t5_2qowo

Not unless they go out of their way to build a friendship with me. I will entertain them at that point. A coworker? Yeah Ill be extra nice to them.  However I have a resting serious face.
