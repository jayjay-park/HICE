10452233,0,t1_dcstrpl,Im happy to share. I grew up in a conservative Christian home. Im a moderateindependent Christian. I always thought I was prolife. I think that our struggles in this area were a blessing because I dont know that I would have questioned what I was told if we didnt have IF. I dont think anyone else should have a say in what I do with my body and how I choose to handle my reproductive rights or you know handle my useless uterus. I feel that I may be prolife in the sense that I wish abortions werent needed and that I dont truly know how I would choose to act myself in a situation where abortion was an option. But that is not a reality and I dont have the right nor should I have the right to tell other women how they shouldneedcould view their reproductive health and all the myriad of emotional and mental health complications that come along with sex babies not wanting babies or otherwise. Basically Im now a prochoice woman who happens to be a Christian that is choosing to love and support instead of being pigeonholed by rhetoricinterpretation from the Christian far right. And honestly I have a lot of you to thank for being so open about your views and also being willing to listen.

Like just stopped calling checking in or giving a shit. So I mentioned it to my mom. Which created a huge emotional explosion calling back decades of family trauma. Its been a week long ordeal several sobbing conversations about abandonment issues lack of family support loneliness and family divorceabuse etc. Not super. I think as I grapple with the idea that the fantasy of a family I could build for myself by having children feels further and further out of reach I am getting more and more sensitive to the fact that my existing family is so fractured and fucked up and everythings just merging in to one roiling fucked up mudpit of trauma that I feel like I am drowning in. My mom dropped by yesterday to check on me and brought valentines chocolate and left . on my table. We had said earlier we dont want to borrow from family for this again fucked up family dynamics around money but she brought it as a little something to help while we are stressed.

Even though I dont regret my decision I still have days where I think What if he turned out to be high functioning? Then I think about the heart defect and all the other problems he might have had which we didnt know of yet because we never made it to the anatomy scan and remind myself that he would have had a poor quality of life and not been able to do most of the things kids do.  It still hurts every day knowing I essentially killed my child but it was the right decision for our family. Which is why it pisses me off when advocates only show videos of high functioning Down Syndrome kids and ask How could you terminate someone like this?

We grab a blanket and he curls up under it under my legs and passes out while I do  minutes with the program.  So calming.

11128125,0,t1_detcvr5,Its the countries requirements. Heck if you wanted to adopt from China you must have a certain BMI! And yes under who may adopt header it states that. Its sad bc we would make awesome moms. Our backyard faces a playground. We live where there are great schools and my wife is an educator. As for the money its expensive. There is a tax credit which helps though with some of the expense. Under Maryland law the birth mother has  days after signing away her parental rights to change her mind. you wont be able to get the baby until after the time is up for her to change her mind and the baby during that time goes to a middle family. ,IFseniorclass,detd3ff,1,t5_3hzc2

11297501,0,t3_617va5,Another morning twatwanding. The couple before me got some bad news so I had to wait naked until the situation was over as both dr.s were in there for around  minutes or so. I then found the couple in BloodWork Land and she was crying. I felt so bad for them.The fellow couldnt wrangle my righty this time so they called my Dr in who found it and told it to stop misbehaving. I am ready to trigger tonight with the retrieval on Sunday and have about  follicles ready to go into the arena. Im prepping for fresh but also have frozen instructions as well. To do fresh I need two higher grade embryos. Ive only had one each round so its highly unlikely. Butt shot tonight in where Ill probably wail like crazy because Im fine with doing my own shots but having someone else do them gives me serious anxiety. At least its Friday. ,IFseniorclass,dfcjzew,2,t5_3hzc2
