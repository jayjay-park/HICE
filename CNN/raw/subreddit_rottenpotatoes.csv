12755,0,t3_1u9rr3,I can pinpoint the exact moment when I mentally checked out of Terrence Malicks torturous To the Wonder and started thinking Wankage! It was the scene in which Ben Affleck and Rachel McAdams are standing in the midst of a bison herd and nuzzling romantically like lovestruck horses. What if the animals suddenly started to stampede? I thought. Are they being careful where they step? What are they doing in the middle of a herd of bison anyway? Wouldnt it stink to high heaven there? Couldnt they get a room?To the Wonder is only Malicks sixth film since his  debut Badlands  like Stanley Kubrick he likes to take his time  but it arrives only two years after the wondrous transporting The Tree of Life and it plays like an undercooked pie that hasnt had enough time to cool and settle. Even when they seem to be about nothing at all Malicks films always have a strong subtext  To the Wonder like Badlands and Days of Heaven is a love story  but this time subtext alone is not enough. The movie is intentionally elusive like a memory you cant quite fully recall but the result has all the depth and weight of a greeting card.Shot by the great Emmanuel Lubezki who also served as cinematographer for The Tree of Life and The New World To the Wonder is never less than gorgeous whether its showing the sights of Paris and Normandy where the tourist Neil Affleck falls in love with the single mother Marina Oblivions Olga Kurylenko or the endless skies of Oklahoma where the couple settles down to live.But the Midwest with its swaying wheat fields and picturesque sunsets is no match for France and the restless Marina and her daughter return home. While Neil seizes the opportunity to rekindle an affair with the Okie rancher Jane Rachel McAdams a local priest Javier Bardem struggles with his increasing lack of faith.Spirituality has always played an important role in Malicks movies and Bardems scenes are the best thing about To the Wonder  an exploration of a man who finds it increasingly difficult to believe in the things he has devoted his life to when he marries a couple during a wedding ceremony his gaze is distant as if he werent really present. He yearns to regain his belief in God but he cant because hes tired of pretending he has feelings he really doesnt.The juxtaposition of the two storylines makes the movies intent clear  how do you rekindle faith romantic or spiritual once youve lost it?  but the way Malick handles it borders on the banal. The director keeps his main theme buried intentionally omitting the slivers of plot that would invest you in the characters. Affleck in particular suffers a lot He often looks like he doesnt know what hes supposed to be doing and he gets maybe six lines of dialogue letting you know what his character is thinking. The rest is delivered via Malicks standard voiceover narration this time in French and Spanish with English subtitles and although the movie invites you to fill in the gaps the effort doesnt seem worthy this time.Rachel Weisz Amanda Peet Barry Pepper and Jessica Chastain all shot scenes for To the Wonder but none of them made it into the finished film. Thats nothing new for Malick who cut Billy Bob Thornton Mickey Rourke Viggo Mortensen and a host of other actors out of The Thin Red Line and reduced Sean Penns performance to an extended cameo in The Tree of Life. Malick is the kind of director who finds his movies during the editing process which is fine as long as you come up with a picture that means something. But To the Wonder is exactly what people who dont like Malicks movies say about them Its a pretentious lovely bore.,rottenpotatoes,cefvxc6,0,t5_2zh6j
