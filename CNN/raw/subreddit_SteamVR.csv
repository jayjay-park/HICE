3248960,0,t1_coydq7t,You can be more then sure that SteamVR will be more expensive the the Oculus but you can also be sure it will be better. Just like there is budget gaming PC Oculus and real gaming PCs Valve will be the expensive gaming rig. I am personally willing to pay whatever quality costs. And I think sadly that will be more then I am hoping but should be worth it.,SteamVR,coyrhj6,1,t5_2zr8m

3476730,0,t1_cpok5aj,There are two ways in which a game can be compatible with VR The actual coding of support for the hardware peripheral and Oculus runtime.  Making changes within your game to the UI scaling locomotion etc to make it a good VR experience.If theyve done the work already on  for the Rift that saves them having to do much more for the Vive.They will still have to put in additional coding work  for it to actually work with SteamVR.You could think of it as being much the same as when developers that already supported the Rift DK updated their software to support the DK as well.,SteamVR,cpokmm7,1,t5_2zr8m

4547947,0,t1_ct1v4ay,This was my though as well. I was wondering what sort of games wed be seeing if we were confined to small areas the whole time and what would happen if a game was designed for a room that was bigger than a player had available.,SteamVR,ct3w6br,1,t5_2zr8m

6053733,0,t3_3ye24e,gt So I conclude that Valves recommended render buffer of . times the screen resolution for a reported FOV of  degrees is still undersampling the center of the screen by a factor of two  physical pixels per rendered pixel.How do you get to this conclusion? Its not a conclusion I can make with those values. The image needs to be distorted to counteract the effect of the lenses it has nothing to do with pixels per degree.Sure the lenses are probably made so that you dont have a higher pixel density at the edges than in the middle.  But when I look at the distorted image I barely see a magnification in the middle. Its certainly not magnified by factor . probably not even by factor .. ,SteamVR,cyd579d,1,t5_2zr8m

6999851,0,t1_d19psi8,Like he says a singelplayer focused ld title is the opposite direction of the franchise.A portal type game would make more sense in VR though portal  might be way too much for most people unless it was vastly different puzzle wise.  For the most part from valves own research fps arent really what shine in VR. ,SteamVR,d19rzdn,1,t5_2zr8m

7225213,0,t3_4ee61b,I cant speak for Unreal but I can tell you how I handle teleportation in Unity.In general terms teleportation is handle by projecting a ray cast directly out from the controller to a specified distance. I check that the collider the ray impacts if it impacts one at all is a valid one. In Unity I have these tagged as Ground. From there I change the position of the entire camera rig very important! The whole rig must be teleported to the point of impact of the ray cast.I can describe how I handle interaction in Unity but Im not sure that the tools I use would translate well. If the above teleportation description made sense I can give it a try as well in equally abstract terms and you can try to implement it.,SteamVR,d1zgbcq,4,t5_2zr8m
