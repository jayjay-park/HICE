6422427,0,t3_43o2m7,Im a big fan of turn  crack the earth on the draw but its not much better later in the game imho.  Young pyromancer would be a little funky bit of a nonbo with board sweepers butnif your loading up on more spot removal then I assume it would be fine.,SkredRed,czjm5z6,1,t5_3c892

10275926,0,t3_5n5rdc,Mainboard Relic was a thing before Dredge became tier  and Id still include it after. Its always been a nice tool to have against decks that use their graveyard Snapcaster Gofy etc. ,SkredRed,dc8tya0,7,t5_3c892
11029361,0,t1_dei292v,Im glad to hear the meta is as unfriendly as i thought it was and im not just bad P. I like the idea of running Simian Spirit Guides and running a lower curve with Rabblemasters. I have few slots in sideboard so extra land destruction is going in. Thank you ,SkredRed,dei5inj,1,t5_3c892
