Theres no reason to poke the bear in the sense that you boast about your kill beforehand or do it on social media or do it because the bear has notoriety or be from New Jersey either. Disgusting. And its not like he was helping an aging bear or a lame deer this bear was obviously thriving with its condition. ,bearsdoinghumanthings,d8yna8t,53,t5_2v4o7

Then have you seen the number of folks hurt every year by doing it?  If you are going to hit up one animal refuge it doesnt seem far out of the realm of possibilities that they may go check out another one in a more rugged environment. ,bearsdoinghumanthings,dcxuln8,-1,t5_2v4o7
