98272,0,t3_1v37mg,How do gods get their power?  Is it domination over the world?  Strength of the faith of the followers more followers amp stronger faith? Having priests sacrifice something to release some sort of energy etc? Something completely different?How this gets answered will help to determine if gods can coexist. And as mentioned elsewhere just because people think theyre worshiping different gods does not make it so. If two areas are in different regions and may look at different aspects of the same god as more important. Rohan the horse god may be a warrior god to those on the plains and hundreds thousands of miles away be seen as a god of growing things as horses are seen as farm animals.Gods in different regions of the world may have no real issue until they really interact. Europe had at least two different pantheons during Roman times. The far north were worshiping ThorOdinetc while the Romans had their pantheon. There was conflict over wealth gold land slaves salt and much more and religion would have been just another component of conflict. ,loremasters,cepm9el,1,t5_2wwy5

Later on they found a particularly evil intelligent sword they needed to destroy with some traditional molten lava. Cue a few chase scenes and all i had to do was wait till it slipped their mind long enough for each of the sword bearers to get more than thirty feet apart. That put a pretty good twist in the plot and made for a great reoccuring bbegex pc.

176182,0,t3_1vyw0e,Hey I read over this and thought that you should get some feedback sense you obviously spent a lot of time thinking this through.So here is what I have to say. First and foremost lets deal with the text here. This is simply too much. It can be a real deterrent from going on because it is just a massive amount to slug through. Its good that you have everything down pat as that will help create consistency and continuity in your world. However for the rest of us that is a lot of info to dive through just to arrive at the starting point of this conversation.. Everything seems to be logical. Im just curious to see how the players can interact with this. Youve mentioned a few indicators but what else can they influence?. Ideas for Epic tier I would say maybe integrating their epic destiny more to the plot. Make their personal take or view of the situation really fell like theyre relevant to the plot and not just along for the ride. So if one person picks demigod maybe work a way for them to carve out their own domain. Have the other gods either eye them as an usurper or seek to gather their aide against Vecnas and Lloths machinations.That is an example but you get the jist of what I mean. The best advice is to work with your players to create a game that meets a little of what everyone wants.,loremasters,ceyi26v,2,t5_2wwy5

Serious wacky it somewhere in between?A serious game can start the PCs as ensigns then explore the social politics of gaining rank in Star Fleet. Who to schmooze who to use as traction on your scramble to become captain or admiral. All while exploring the galaxy or mess with Federation external politics like dealing with Klingons Ferengi Romulans Dominion etc. A bit grimdark with possibly happily ever after.A wackier game could put the PCs as leaders of respective departments on an exploration mission in deep space. All while captained by someone like Zapp Brannigan who is a parody of James T. Kirk the PCs pretty much have to figure out how to stay alive when sent on super deadly probably insane and improbably useless or futile missions. Ive considered running a game like this with Paranoia. Oh and make sure on every away mission there is always a redshirt who cant help but die in some crazy way often being used as canon fodder or begin sacrificed for the safety of the group.,loremasters,ceyxs86,3,t5_2wwy5

There they are food for the Devourer Wurm the endless hungry monstrosity that seeks to end all life. Only those who serve one of the other gods have protection  they show up in Urcaen in the lands of their deity and serve as warriors against the endless horrors that besiege the realms of the gods.. Jade Empire The gates of Heaven and Hell are closed and the dead are forced to wander the world slowly going mad and becoming dangerous ghosts. No one knows why this is so  it has been going on for a generation or two and its not clear which god has stopped performing their function or why. If its not fixed the world will fall apart as the maddened dead overwhelm the living..

348123,0,t3_1xwrhh,As an exSAW gunner you can single fire burst fire and full automatic an automatic only weapon. But it works in reverse order ... meaning I didnt learn how to fire a single round until I had quite a bit of experience with the weapon because it is all about timing.I do agree with previous posts automatic fire should be an action. However I would say that you should add d per round fired suffer a  penalty to hit for each additional die and add  to the difficulty to hit for every  space between targets.Practical example  M Squad Automatic Weapon  Well say that in a round or whatever you want to call it the SAW on full auto will fire  rounds. Since it is . well say that it does d points of damage plus d points for the additional rounds. SINCE it is full auto you will subtract up to  points from the attack roll.In action  A bad guy jumps out at the SAW gunners perfect range.  SAW gunner declares Full Auto action on said bad guy.  SAW gunner rolls an .  Bad guy has a defense of .   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a miss   is a miss   is a miss  Total damage is d ... WOW  However a roll of  wouldve only been d the other rounds scatter due to the gunners inability to control the burst.Then you can apply this general rule to all burst fire weapons like an M which would be d for the first round d for the additional two rounds.And situations and gear then starts to matter  From a supported position add one burst fire round to your initial attack roll  With a vertical grip add one round to your initial attack roll  A bipod adds three rounds to your initial attack roll  A tripod adds ten rounds to your initial attack rollSo that same situation the bad guy jumps out and the SAW gunner is prone supported position with his bipod out   is a hit d d for supported d for bipod   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit d   is a hit dno more rounds this round  Thats d ... And more importantly had the gunner only rolled a  it still wouldve been d damage.Now two bad guys with  between them. Both bad guys have a defense of  but target  has a defense of  since the gunner has to move  between targets. The gunner standing with no bipod declares I will fire full auto with three rounds at bad guy  and the remainder at bad guy .  Gunner rolls an .   is a hit on  d   is a hit on  d   is a hit on  d   is a missed round as the gunner changes targets it passes just to the right of target    is a missed round as the gunner changes targets it passes just to the left of target  and two spaces to the right of target    is the first round fired at target  whos defense is  a miss  All remaining rounds are a miss.Same situation but now the gunner is firing prone from a bipod.   is a hit on  d d d  round at  because prone  round at  because bipod   is a missed round as the gunner changes targets   is a missed round as the gunner changes targets   is a hit on  d d  rounds at highest roll because bipod  total for bipod   is a hit on  d   is a miss due to  defense of  all remaining rounds miss.

1118784,0,t3_26xcfh,Tiranna Nornselm lost her father to plague when she was very young perhaps  or so just at the fuzzy edge of her memories.  Her mother refused to speak of him as bringing back the memories was far too painful and moved back to the nearest city.  There she became overly interested in the macabre and looked for any information on death and resurrection.  Realizing that clerical resurrection was impossible at this late date she delved deep into the forbidden lore of deliberately censored magical texts.  She even went as far as to apprentice at a local temple in order to learn how to stop necromancy.  Then at  after several years of emotional neglect Tiranna ran away to find her fathers grave and upon arriving at the now abandoned village she found he had been interred in a communal grave as is common in times of epidemic.  Stealing a shovel from the nearest hamlet she dug furiously for most of a day until she struck remains.  Convinced that those were her fathers she disinterred them never noticing that the size and pelvis meant that that skeleton was of a girl no older than she is now.  She placed them on a blanket and proceeded to attempt a cobbled together ritual from the censored and burned texts from the temple.Unfortunately for her... it worked.Upon animation of the skeleton she began to pour her heart into this unthinking unfeeling construct of bone magic and grief.  The lack of response was the last straw.  She preferred her own fantasy to the harsh reality and every skeleton she raises becomes the current hope that that is her father and the previous ones that were destroyed are determined to not be her father because hed never leave her again.Maybe that ones him....Edit On proofreading this makes me rather sad...,loremasters,chvgs8w,9,t5_2wwy5
1232043,0,t3_286z8p,This is really a great post.  Its not absurdly intricate and expensive like a lot of the gaming tables you see.  Using the chessex mat in the center is really smart.  I think that the fancy projection displays on tables is a pain in the ass and not useful anyway because you cant see the damn grid when moving pieces due to shadows.Not having legs or anything is smart too.  Its portable just plop it on top of any old table and you are good to go at anyones house.  I also like that the play surface isnt raised up I see a lot of people having these desklike tables where players have a little cubby in front of them and the play surface is chest height.  That would be a pain in the ass to DM on IMO.Yep this is really awesome and Im gonna start looking for old poker tables to convert.My only quibble is that I think that putting glass on top of it is not worth it IMO it will make it hard to utilize the grid if the glass is at all thick.  Ive been using a chessex mat for years and only had very light stains if I didnt wipe it down and left writing on it for months at a time.  Maybe the cleaning products you tried to use have ruined the surface and its time for a new one?  I love the chessex mat other than that I sometimes get marker on my fingers when wiping up.Maybe consider just using a mediumthick sheet of plastic as a cover if you want to be about to dryerase?  You wont have the problem of the offset distance between the pieces and the grid.Anyways really cool job Im definitely stealing your idea.

Only the most competent of people were allowed to wield such power and had oversight in how it was used. At first it may not make a lot of sense but over a century or so of laws and restrictions magic wouldnt be so prevalent. I basically handled like gun control. A license was required and was rather bureaucratic. To make it more restrictive I put in place special items that I called Spell Shards that were required to cast higher level spells. These could be obtain through rigorous study at an academy or through devious bartering on the blackmarket though rare when one came up. Usually as consequence for a wizard being murdered and the shard stolen.This also gave me a reason for spellcasters to sort of be a high commodity. They were wanted simply for the price a spell shard would fetch.   The players took to it well enough and it still allowed for the occasional bad guy to be a spell caster as he could have fallen from the side of good or simply came into contact with one on the blackmarket. ,loremasters,cm7et92,2,t5_2wwy5

Another possibility is to make the characters super weapon come at a great cost. Make them sacrifice to earnkeepuse the power.

Wiping out an entire racial pantheon would likely lead to significant upheaval as the other warlike and evilaligned gods duke it out between themselves.The elven pantheon often depicted as perennially opposed to the orcish pantheon would likely go one of two general directions  either theyll lose all motivation and just lark about or theyd be steeled in their resolve and go hunting for some other evil pantheon that theyve had problems with previously.I imagine that if you by destroyed did not mean that the bodies of the dead orcs were obliterated youd get a significant upsurge in undead for various reasons. Places where undead cant reach or didnt reach fast enough might get an upsurge in carrion crawlers and other creepycrawlies that eat dead bodies.You might also get a subsection of previous orc slaves that suddenly got rich by looting the belongings of their previous slave masters and then using that to get ahead in life.So basically youd have some shortterm shifts and some longterm consequences but generally any other evil humanoid with a greataxe and a chain shirt would end up taking the place of the orcs.

Theyd start by dealing with the storm as it happens then cleaning up andor investigating why the storm was magical in the first place and go from there.I like your plot idea but I cannot stress enough that youll be happier waiting to do it later when you have a year or two of DMing under your belt first.,loremasters,cpdactw,6,t5_2wwy5

3635865,0,t3_320jbj,Yes yes yes!!!  My best buddy and I have wanted to do this for ages and are now in the middle of a campaign.  It works WONDERS if you can establish a few ground rules. Treat the game like your kid.  You never contradict the other GM in front of the players.  Realize you both have a vision for the game and hopefully youve talked about what it is at length before the session!!! and roll with whatever comes up.  If the other GMs vision doesnt match your own.  Keep your mouth shut and deal with it after the game.  The key is the immersion for the PCs. Make sure to respect the other GM and dont hog floor time.  Be sure to include them in you feel like youve been overly in the spotlight. Use each other!  You can now do dialogue between NPCs without it being weird!  Go for it!My buddy and I are on the same page almost all the time and talk constantly about where were going.  Having a sounding board of someone whos invested in the campaign to bounce ideas off of almost always results in better ideas.  Our campaign is x better for it.Plus it allows us as GMs to really make battle interesting.  We split the enemy units up equally among the two of us.  That way I dont actually know what is or isnt going to happen in the fight.  I can plan my few guys and get to be honestly surprised with the rest!  It also allows us to experiment much deeper with complicated class builds as well as spells and combat maneuvers.  When I dont control everything and get a break in between rounds then I can honestly think a little bit more about apply that status effect or using a spell in a creative manner... instead of just moveampattack with all my units.  Its made for far more interesting combat!  I cant recommend it enough!,loremasters,cq6psh1,28,t5_2wwy5

4041176,0,t3_36nwk9,Ive always like the list over from d radio forums. A simple thing at only  questions. I do like the link post here earlier that looks good too.. What does your character Love? With a capital L. Even the most reviled evil despot has something somewhere they care about a great deal and would give of themselves to protect  perhaps even sacrificing their life to protect and care for. This could be a friend family member or lover. Perhaps a homeworld a group of people or a village that once sheltered you. Maybe you have a softspot for kittens.. What does your character Hate? With a capital H. Even the most benevolent and wellmeaning character has something somewhere they hate would go out of their way to harm or would irrationaly distrust. This could be an individual in the characters past or a group of people. Even a planet. Perhaps the character has a prejudice against Twileks or has sworn to destroy the bounty hunter clan that destroyed his village as a child.. Why is your character willingly and eagerly working for the rebellionempireguildorganizationorderetc.whatevergroupthePCsareactivelyworkingwith? Why is your character an active participant in what this group does and willing to work with the rest of the party? Are they devoted to a cause? Do they have a simple love of credits? Are they devoted to stamping out a threat?,loremasters,crgxata,1,t5_2wwy5

They may try to get rid of evidence intimidate or kill witnesses or even the other investigators they may try to run away before the truth is found out or they may come clean and face judgement but I wouldnt count on that.You could prepare heists for them to find and get rid of evidence pointing to them or even give them a chance to make their case in a judgement or they may face pursuit and bad reputation as they flee.
