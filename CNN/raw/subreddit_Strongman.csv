406359,0,t3_1yqmoa,There are a few of us on here and in rhighlandgames as well. As far as how often I train it depends on the time of year. During the season I like to throw  times per week and lift . During the winter months it skews the other way quite a bit because I do not have enough daylight after work to make it feasible. Im lucky to live in an area where snow and bad weather are not a concern so I continue throwing on weekend days during the winter months.Edit I guess I didnt address the question very well. For some reason I read how often do you train dont know why. So as for how I train I do drills look up the contrarian approach  multiple days per week mixed with throwing at the end of sessions. As the season wears on I throw more than drill though. Depending on where you are located there very well could be a group nearby that would be happy to let you come try it out. Look up highland games on youtube and you will find lots of good videos of guys like Dan McKim Matt Vincent Jake Sullivan etc. who are at the top of this sport right now. Also look for Ryan Vierra Francis Brebner Bruce Aitken who are all giants in the sport but are no longer active throwers for the most part. Another good place to ask this question is nasgaweb.com North American Scottish Games Association it is the main message board for the games and where most active throwers post. This is how I got hooked up with my original throwing group since moved and my new one. I maintain a training log there and most of the folks are very helpful and will commentencourage you along.As for where first check to see if anyone trains in your area and if they are amenable to having you join them almost everyone is. Otherwise most train at their own property parks or a nearby colleges throwing field.,Strongman,cfmvw3n,3,t5_2twwd
415668,0,t1_cfntli3,Honestly man for a dl lockout I dont see anything wrong with your form.  You were able to create the tension in your core and summon the brute strength necessary for picking that weight up.  It took a bit if practice before I got used to block pulls and pulling from a rack is supposed to be harder because there is more tension in the bar.  Your legs and arms look well placed you kept your back flat hinged well and locked out without any flaws apparent to me.  We would be better able to scrutinize your dl form if your show us full rom and pull from the floor or from a lower rackblock height.,Strongman,cfnulnt,2,t5_2twwd

1682502,0,t1_cjqr808,Went to a chiro for a long time for persistent upper back cramps and really bad spinal deviation caused by the cramps and years of whiplash injuries. He got me to the point that Id only need a tuneup once or twice a year if I was careful but I had to really slow down any lifting progress.Then I injured myself anyway went to a PT for  months kept doing the exercises for  more months and then realized that I never have pain or instability in my shoulders any more and can push volume far more easily.In my experience if something spinal is massively screwed up a chiro can definitely get you back to seminormal but Id say that barring some sort of acute trauma back problems are usually caused by something else that the chiro may or may not be qualified to address.,Strongman,cjr8qej,3,t5_2twwd

3998191,0,t1_crbzvmd,Well... Personally while I always read the threads and try to contribute as often as I can not necessarily on the Strongman Saturday threads but in general Im stuck training out of a University gym with none of the implements and no way of getting to a gym with the implements consistently. To be clear Im not trying to soap box about it. Im attempting to get into the Strongman scene in Canada Ottawa area specifically but the events are often absolutely insane. This makes it hard to go out and even so much as try events when theyre looking for a  Axle CampP for reps or an  tire flip. Or a bus drag followed by a bus pull.So... Ill contribute whenever I feel I have a valid point or there is something that I cant understand about a given question or event. The majority of the time however Im stuck being the guy thats trying to get brutally strong with nothing but barbells and cables just to get to the point to try a show so Im left with very little to actually contribute to event specific threads. So really... I like the threads and theyre well run its just that Im stuck in a spot that I cant contribute for the majority of the time.,Strongman,crc0xvs,9,t5_2twwd

Fronts also work on upper back involvement which is vital for OVH. I love zerchers as an accessory as well as paused squats.  Box squats never did much for more.  Back squats are kind of like cash  its king. You cannot go wrong with back squats big weight small weight low volume high volume.  You can get a ton out of back squatting but it exhausts you and primarily for strongman training I believe fronts will translate the best into events versus overall raw leg strength.  ,Strongman,ct3gkw7,6,t5_2twwd

Did  on the  AMRAP could have maybe done a few more but at that point I was taking  breaths in between reps and it was starting to be more like singles.Still pulling wearing Oly shoes as breaking the floor isnt a problem and it makes the lockout easier. My thought on my catbacking after a couple of weeks of doing deadstop reps is that I am probably pulling too fast before the weight breaks the ground which then rounds my thoracic spine.

6941230,0,t1_d12ze52,He wrote this on his Facebook as of March gt I get asked alot why I havent been competing the last few years. I usually reply that Ive been struggling with injuries. Which is true. But the main reason for me dropping out of the strongman circuit Ive kept mostly to myself.gt In  I was diagnosed with a heart condition called supraventricular tachycardia or SVT. I started getting these symptoms in  but they got much worse in  and it was then when I first sought medical help as this was getting out of control. SVT is a condition where your heart starts to beat really fast around bpm even if your not doing anything strenuous. If you want to know more about SVT its easy to find info online.gt SVT is something that you are born with and is a relatively common defect. Its not something I earned through my lifestyle as a strength athlete just to get that out of the way. The treatment for SVT is to have a catheter ablation to burn away the cause of the symptoms.gt The only problem for me was that the healthcare system in Iceland is so financially starved that I couldnt get in for the ablation until january  or around  months after getting diagnosed. And that was only because of the fact that my SVT problem was so bad that I often had to go  times a week to the ER to get help. Unfortunately the ablation was unsuccessful. I was told at the time that they wanted to try again in about  months. These  months turned out to be almost  very long years because of the previously mentioned financially starved healthcare system provided by the Icelandic government.gt Anyways. On december rd  I got in for a second ablation attempt which was successful! You can only imagine how relieved and happy I was. The doctor told me that if I was symptom free for  months after that I would be cleared good to compete again.Well its been  months now and I havent felt better in years! gt With the support of my fiancee family and friends I believe that I can still achieve my goals in the sport I love which I set many years ago!Now I will truly be working on making a comeback!,Strongman,d1348yp,5,t5_2twwd

7368862,0,t3_4g8d67,I came in third in the  pound open class at the  Capital Classic Strongman Challenge on Saturday video montage of my highlights here I was off to a rough start after getting three reps on the  lb log and  reps on the  lb axel deadlift since the other  pounders were brutishly strong and got a lot of reps on those but I fought my way into second placehalf a point ahead of the third place competitorgoing into the stones after getting second in the farmers carries  lbs per hand and winning the truck pull event. I then got second place in the stones but the guy in third jumped me by being the only  pound competitor to table the  lb stone. I had gotten that stone in practice but the day was not my day. This was my first contest in the open category and my second contest ever so Im very pleased with my performance. I am definitely lacking in brute strength relative to some of the monsters I was up against but made up for it in the moving events. I plan to address my pressing until I no longer deem it a weakness and hopefully Ill bring up my deadlift a bunch too.,Strongman,d2fsef0,5,t5_2twwd

11052716,0,t1_dejjace,The genetics debate always goes no true Scotsman and it just gets silly.You have to have good genetics to win the Arnold so anyone that wins the Arnold by definition MUST have good genetics.  We run into the issue where we define outcome as the measuring determination for the presence of good genetics and in doing so make it an impossibility that someone without said genetics could possibly get to that level.I had someone on rfitness recently accuse me of superior genetics due to my strict press.  When I informed him that I had dislocated my right shoulder  times and tore the labrum and that this was a pretty good sign that I dont have the best genetics for shoulders based on how structurally unsound they are he doubled down that this was even MORE proof that I had superior genetics due to how I could overcome these issues.  It was unfathomable that results could be a product of hard work and time.Long winded response but summary would be that well never have a real answer.  In truth I imagine anyone with real superior genetics is probably out doing crossfit or football and bringing home a serious paycheck.,Strongman,dekt1h7,5,t5_2twwd

Im assuming youre getting your weight the day before the contest right? Im sitting around  and gotta be user  by Friday but not sweating it as it seems easy for me to lose a pound over night from water weight without trying. Sometimes its  or . Combine that with some generous water and fiber I take to clean the pipes a bit and maybe some sauna work day of and Ill be good. Youll get it. Just takes a bit of effort.
