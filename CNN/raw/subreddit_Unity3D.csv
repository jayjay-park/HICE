252646,0,t3_1wtnc1,Whats your definition of successful?Im by no means an artist in any sense of the word but I succeeded in launched my first game Bouncing Bombs using nothing more than Unity primitives and some simplistic .png files for my ingame objects. Its definitely not going to win any best game visuals awards but it gets the job done decently enough.With that said I will say that the Unity primitive meshes might not be the most efficient pieces of geometry which could potentially lead you into some performance trouble on certain platforms.  Take my currently under development game for example Its targeted at Android and its rendering job basically consists of drawing  balls on the screen. If approached correctly using Unitys builtin dynamic draw call batching all  of those balls could map to a single draw call making the GPUCPU very happy.In my initial implementation instead of a single draw call for all  balls each ball required its own draw call.  calls might not seem like a lot but I saw a definite frame rate hit. Long story short even after addressing some stupid things I was doing I was still generating  draw calls. The final piece of the puzzle came from reading this little bit from the Unity Documentationgt Batching dynamic objects has certain overhead per vertex so batching is applied only to meshes containing less than  vertex attributes in total.If your shader is using Vertex Position Normal and single UV then you can batch up to  verts whereas if your shader is using Vertex Position Normal UV UV and Tangent then only  verts.Unitys sphere mesh has somewhere around  verts. To get dynamic batching to work with the shader Im using I needed to create my own sphere mesh with  or less verts. Switching to a lowvert mesh dropped my  draw calls significantly and my frame rate on my lowend mobile device jumped by  fps.As they say youre mileage may vary but its definitely something to keep in mind.If youre interested in further the details regarding my draw call woes you can check out the more detailed entry in my blog ,Unity3D,cf6xw6i,1,t5_2qwj8

404848,0,t1_cfmgs9q,Do you have any evidence that XML serialization is horribly slow? Every benchmark Ive ever seen has showed XML to be significantly faster for serializationdeserialization when compared to json. Obviously its going to depend on the serialization library you are using but in general Ive always seen XML beating json in benchmarks especially in .NET land where XML is standard. File size is definitely a big difference but id contend that the text assets in your game will be a tiny contribution to overall size in the first place.Anyways I would just recommend that if you decide to go with a textbased format you just use whatever format you are comfortable with be it json XML yaml or whatever other format you want. yaml is actually used by unity internally for scene and prefab metadata. You SHOULD however probably make it easy to switch serialization formats easily because you might decide later that you want a binary format for example or you want to switch from one text format to another. On desktop you really might not care about file size bloat in textbased formats but on a mobile device you might need to switch to a binary format to save space. In a debug build maybe you want to edit text assets quickly in a release build not so much.My  cents.,Unity3D,cfmq8u6,3,t5_2qwj8

Its certainly not out of the question but its likely to come in bits and pieces.For a grid editor are you talking about just snapping things to position inscene? I can probably manage that fairly soon. If you mean something more like DToolkits TileMap editor that generates map prefabs I honestly dont know...

982372,0,t3_25csr8,This is GREAT.  Absolutely awesome!As someone who teaches Unity to students this is one of the best small and easy changes ever made.  The problem with all the shortcuts is that it confuses users where things actually live.  If I was a betting man Id bet the majority of the Unity community doesnt know exactly where components like rigidbody actually live or that scripts are components or that scripts are not GameObjects.  To the average user especially ones who are not a fan of code theyre all the same thing the mystical GameObjectComponentThingerDinger.Plus the shortcuts are a black box.  You dont know if theyre caching them or not without research.  Being properties and following the Microsoft this is how you should use properties conventions one should assume theyre fast similar access speed as a field but theyre usually not.  Unity makes that mistake left and right though.  To be fair I did that too about seven years ago.The endless confusion this will solve for newbie users.  This is for the best in the long haul.  I will probably get a lot of hate for this comment but... wait a few years and I bet youll see a lot less confused people.Random fun fact GetComponentltTgt is also surprisingly slow.,Unity3D,chfycgu,19,t5_2qwj8

1037387,0,t1_chm73an,Well the sky consists of many pieces but you are correct the clouds consist of a few noise maps. Theyre very simple really. As cool as volumetric clouds would be I want to keep performance a priority here. As for the air travel thing you could certainly use this sky for such a game but you wouldnt be able to fly through the clouds as they are flat. Of course if you wanted to get fancy you could use the existing cloud layer to generate particle based clouds for that purpose. Im not sure how performance friendly that would be however.,Unity3D,chm7f9l,2,t5_2qwj8
1043652,0,t3_261sf5,Voxel terrain is inherently slower than heightmapbased terrain because theres a third dimension to consider. Its not as easy as iterating over a a d array of height values.As far as networking goes it will be problematic when clients need to get the entire world from the server. You send clients the complete terrain when they join and send block changes as they occur on the server. Youd essentially do the same thing for d terrain its just theres a lot more data to send. It will take a bit for clients to get the terrain up and running because they have to generate the mesh on their side once theyve got all the data but it shouldnt take too long if your terrain is small or youre only generating a small part of a large terrain.Here are some numbers for you. Please note that Im not too experienced with Unitys networking so Im not sure how you would actually send the data to the clients a bunch of RPCs seems a bit impractical. Lets say you have a x heightmap terrain you want to send to a client. Youd probably want to send the height and splatmap values so thats          bytes   MB. Thats really not a big deal for most internet connections today. Now lets say you have a xx voxel terrain and you have floats representing density and a single byte representing block type at each point in your d array. Thats          bytes   MB. Now thats a problem. If youre doing Minecraftstyle terrain you only need one byte per block so thats around  MB. Still a large amount of data. On a  Mbps connection that will take at best  minutes to download. So not very ideal. I think it would be best to stream in the terrain as the client explores it.,Unity3D,chmx1y5,2,t5_2qwj8

As you can imagine the fillrate on mobile is quite a bit worse than desktop cards.In the Scene view look in the upper left for a render mode drop down. By default its set to RGB. Every once in a while and especially after adding a particle effect or something with semi transparency change that mode to Overdraw and observe. Look for any bright hot spots. These will give you a good indication of where you are drawing too many things on top of each other.

1423560,0,t1_ciupxvi,ampampamp Additive color sfw gtgtAdditive color is color created by mixing light of two or more different colors. Red green and blue are the additive primary colors normally used in additive color system. Additive color is in contrast to subtractive color in which colors are created by subtracting absorbing parts of the spectrum of light present in ordinary white light by means of colored pigments or dyes such as those in paints inks and the three dye layers in typical color photographs on filmgtThe combination of two of the standard three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color magenta or yellow in the form of dyes or pigments are the standard primary colors in subtractive color systems. The subtractive system using primaries that are the secondaries of the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a wide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red green and blue light that reach the eye.gtComputer monitors and televisions are the most common examples of additive color. Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that each pixel in CRT LCD and most other types of color video displays is composed of red green and blue subpixels the light from which combines in various proportions to produce all the other colors as well as white and shades of gray. The colored subpixels do not overlap on the screen but when viewed from a normal distance they overlap and blend on the eyes retina producing the same result as external superimposition.gtgtImage i  Additive color mixing adding red to green yields yellow adding all three primary colors together yields white.Interesting Food coloring | RGB color model | Primary color | Kodacolor filmmaking Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwciupyjs oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteciupyjs.

1543683,0,t1_cj8wpjh,That is somewhat true. Though you have to remember that there are big name titles like Dead Trigger and Shadow Gun that proudly display the Unity D symbol on their splash screen or other areas. Sure there are a lot of horrible games that use Unity free but there are also plenty of great games. The general public will usually forget the crap games and associate the Unity symbol with the bigger games. Its funny how opposite we view the symbol cause when I see the Unity logo I hold the game to a higher standard because I know what the engine is capable of even the free version. Playing games like Dead Trigger Shadow Gun Raven Sword and Deus Ex The Fall is what attracted me to Unity in the first place. Also there are plenty of worse engines out there and there are many garbage games made with Unreal. The engine will only get you so far. Even if you have the best most expensive engine out there if the developer sucks the game will suck. If you pit a Nissan GTR and Subaru BRZ against each other the Nissan wins without a doubt. But if the Nissan driver doesnt know how to handle the power the Subaru wins. If you give a talented developer Unity free I can guarantee you he will make a better game than a beginner developer with Unity Pro. At the end of the day  is a lot of money to spend on a hobby that may or may not bring in money. The free version lacks some great features but so far it hasnt stopped me from making the games I want to make. ,Unity3D,cj9rw6h,1,t5_2qwj8

1849983,0,t3_2fqyx1,My advice after trying quite a few DAWs over the years to try to learn some music production is dont worry about which one youre using unless youre going for something absolutely specific thats best done with one of them. Ableton is a good DAW with a big community with which you can do anything you might possibly want if youre just starting out. Its also comparatively noobfriendly and rather well designed. Im coincidentally messing with it for a podcast project and find it rather enjoyable. Well lets say not as much a pain in the ass as it could be for an idiot trying to use a pro tool. This leads me to believe that what you should look into is expansions. Think of it as using Photoshop. You mess with it a little and get the hang of it but soon enough youre gonna want to get some snazzy fonts or handy filters so you can start to actually express your ideas without having to invent the wheel each time. So Id say chose a DAW one of the big ones get the hang of it in a couple of weeks or months and then look into having fun with plugins samples instruments etc.I know it can be intimidating but at the end of the day if you dont have to make a living out of it straight away you can think of it as a colored childrens keyboard you got yourself to play with only with a lot more buttons. Soon enough youll find yourself enjoying it. Oh and let me emphasize you should just be playing learning with it in the beginning remember that nobody creates beautiful music when starting out. Enjoy the fun of making crappy sounds only you find enjoyable. ,Unity3D,ckc4a5d,2,t5_2qwj8

Also the bigger the horizontal speed the more floating power you have like a glider.

2726787,0,t3_2rahb6,Id recommend learning to implement a on your own without an asset strictly for the learning process. If you wanted to use the built in nav mesh you might could rig something up using quads with textures thrown on them like you had to do for D prior to unity . I havent messed with RTS style logic much But I was able to pick up the built in nav mesh pretty quickly. At least the basics of it havent tried it in D though. You might even start off with a grid based navigation system its probably wont be as intelligent as you want but you could divide your map into a grid and have the unit check around him in a grid in the direction he is moving and determine if there is a wall in the way. Start off small get it to do some basic probably unintelligent navigation and you can improve it from there and you will start to see how it works step by step. Just focus on getting the unit to navigate through the level and around walls even if he ends up hugging a wall and following itwhich is almost guaranteed to happen with a grid that only checks the first set of surrounding grid squares. Im tired I hope this makes at least some sense. I know there is stuff on Google about it I read not terribly long ago.,Unity3D,cne0vv5,2,t5_2qwj8

2746374,0,t3_2rip16,Vector is a structurevalue type meaning if you have a variable with that type it will always have a value that you can change but you cant link anything to it just like ints floats strings and other value types.On the other hand if you have a type that can be referenced like Transform GameObject MonoBehaviour Texture AudioClip or even your own custom script which all ultimately inherit from UnityEngine.Object you can link those by defining your public variable as that type.In your case if you want to manipulate a variable in another Object you need to link the object itself.For example make a public Transform myTransform variable and drag your object to it then you can use myTransform.position to change its position directly.Alternatively you could just link your custom class itself and manipulate its public variables.    public class AnotherObject            public Vector spawnPosition        public class MainClass             link this in the inspector        public AnotherObject myOtherObject        void Start                    myOtherObject.spawnPosition  new Vector.........

2839488,0,t1_cnqcau5,If your only use for it is to get random elements then using a dictionary is not the best solution. Dictionaries are a good data structure if you have to lookup what maps to a key often. e.g. your dictionary would be good if you have the user select a color by nameby either typing it out or selecting it from a list.If you just want to have a random index into multiple data sets then you can either make an object as uZaxacarian said or by using multiple arrays. Using objects is the probably the cleanest way to do that. e.g.    class ColorData            public string Name getset        public Color Color getset        public ColorDatastring name Color color                    Name  name Color  color                ColorData colorDataArray  new ColorDatayellow Color.yellow new ColorDatagreen Color.green        ColorData randomColor  colorDataArrayRandom.Range colorDataArray.Length    Debug.lograndomColor.Name     randomColor.Color,Unity3D,cnqugts,1,t5_2qwj8

I feel in to water and swam around and found no good place to get out of the water as all the walls were too steep too walk.  On finding no way out of the water I found that I could climb steep hills by repeatedly pressing jump.  Did feel particularly elegant but I got out. I was attacked by one enemy and he killed me. I couldnt aim because I shoot where the player looks and not where the camera looks. I found a sweet music machine that was pretty cool played around inside of it for a while. The grass looked pretty neat but I hated it when the camera went down into the grass and I couldnt see anything. Night fell and it was pretty much completely dark. Alot of things that seemed like paths to other places were really steep and I could only get around by repeatedly tapping jump I felt like i was going off the correct path but it didnt seem like there realy was a correct path I talked to a guy and he had a yes no thing but I had no idea how to select yes or No or if I had some objective that needed to be done.  There were some ships floating in the sky that I wanted to drive. I tried to jump up to them and press interact but that didnt seem to work I tried shooting them and that didnt work.  I wanted to ride around in them but I couldnt find anything that seemed like it would let me.I see lots of good work going on in this keep it up.,Unity3D,cns0xw9,2,t5_2qwj8

Youll want to track What you are dragging either by keeping the index of the node or a reference to the node itself Whether you are dragging bool dragging and How far the mouse was from the nodes position corner when you started dragging this is the dragOffset.Begin your OnGUI method with an events test. If you are already dragging a node the event to watch for is MouseUp done dragging. If you are not dragging watch for MouseDown selecting a node and MouseDrag beginning a drag operation.Use this information to build the connection events for linking these nodes together. Play with how the events work together until it feels right. For example for connecting nodes I sometimes like it when I can click on node then click another to link them. Other times I like to click and drag from a section of one node such as a socketpinwhatever to a similar section of another node. It all just depends on the kind of graph you are working on and how you want it to feel.Good luck!,Unity3D,cnxn32p,2,t5_2qwj8

3123452,0,t3_2vwl21,Version ControlI used to not use version control.  I started using Perforce at Sony and I still rather like it when working on a team.  It also has some advantages with regards to binaries but IMHO the binary problem isnt that big a deal on Git unless you have more than  artists or if you have prerendered video.  I still currently use Perforce for fullsize projects at my studio PushyPixels and at our sister studio ZeroTransform.GitHub however is what I use for my own personal projects and its super useful for PUBLIC projects because it has such great web interfaces.  Its also a bit easier to administer Setting up a Perforce server is easy learning how to use it effectively takes some time.  The only trick with it is youll want to get familiar with how it works and make sure that all the people on your team are familiar as well as Git makes it... too easy to shoot yourself in the foot IMHO.  Ive gotten STUCK on Perforce before but Ive never accidentally done something I couldnt rectify and in general you cant unless you are in PAdmin.  On Git... Ive seen data loss from bad merges and the conflict behaviour takes some getting used to.  I recommend SourceTree for a Git gui interface it works well and is flexible to multiple workflows.I ALWAYS use version control on any project I expect to work on for more than  hour.  It has saved my life too many times and it allows me to be faster because I can be more... destructive and headstrong and not worry that it will get me into an irreversible situation.,Unity3D,colqtei,1,t5_2qwj8

Since mecanim is horrible with static additive poses youll need  animations that start with your default pose and end in torso turned fully left right up and down or just left and right if you dont care about vertical aim.First add horizontal aim and vertical aim parameters to your controller  they will affect your aim from scripts.Create layer in your controller set it to additive create a single DD in case youre ignoring vertical aim blend tree and setup your  animations on the axes and put static animation to your  point.Then in some of your scripts that have access to animator add this line to Update animator.PlayYourAdditiveLayerName  f. This will force  animator to always play last frame of your additive animations faking additive poses.All thats left is to feed animator correct aim parameters from your script.If you have Pro license you can also add usage of SetIKRotation to aim your gun more precisely.Edit grammar.,Unity3D,coq9p0x,1,t5_2qwj8

However OnTriggerExit will not be called which is not mentioned in the unity documentation.I need to manually force the event to fire that then calls the OnTriggerExit method in the colliders owner. Or gain access to we reference is used that typically facilitates it. I need to do this when my object is to be destroyed or disabled so OnDisable is a perfect spot to put it.

3689202,0,t3_32n9qu,Hey guysIf you havent seen the video what this does is makes it so you can tap and drag your camera on any mobile device! Just put this in the Update script of your Camera Operator! How the script works is it checks if the mouse button is down duh and then it takes the position of your mouse. It then begins creating a position for a drag and tests if its outside an imaginary box i created with if statements. Once out of the box the camera will begin to move. The movement has acceleration based on how far you are outside the box. This is done by taking the difference of your swipePos and your dragPos. If you need any explanation let me know. I hope someone will try to use it and let me know how it goes. BTW the game in the video is my mobile game Crystal Encounter RTS. Its free on android hereThis code is going to be included in the next update because people hated the camera joystick Dvoid Update  if Input.GetMouseButtonDown  ampamp MouseButtonDownfalse  checks if mouse button is down swipePos  Input.mousePosition gets the mouse or finger positionprint the swipe position is  swipePosMouseButtonDown  true cameraMovingfalse this is used to tell if the camera is being moved if Input.GetMouseButtonUp   this is for ending the movement when finger releasedMouseButtonDown  false cameraMovingfalsedragPos  swipePos sets the final drag position to the mouse position so movement doesnt continueif MouseButtonDowntrue   dragPos  Input.mousePosition gets current mouse pos print the drag position is  dragPosifswipePos.x lt dragPos.x  Screen.width this creates an imaginary box of screen.widthxscreen.width so it scales per devicecameraMovingtruesays the camera is moving this.transform.position  new VectordragPos.x  swipePos.xScreen.width.f this moves the cameraifswipePos.x gt dragPos.x  Screen.widthcameraMovingtruethis.transform.position  new VectorswipePos.x  dragPos.xScreen.width.fifswipePos.y gt dragPos.y  Screen.widthcameraMovingtruethis.transform.position  new VectorswipePos.y  dragPos.yScreen.width.fifswipePos.y lt dragPos.y  Screen.widthcameraMovingtruethis.transform.position  new VectordragPos.y  swipePos.yScreen.width.f,Unity3D,cqcsksg,2,t5_2qwj8

3712701,0,t3_32wps3,C is still C but the coding patterns that you use in Unity a very different from those you would use for a normal application.For instance Singletons a way to have static global classes that are still MonoBehaviours are largely frowned upon in normal development but they are very common and useful in Unity.Also data encapsulation having classes keep as much of their internal data as possible private is paramount in normal development. In Unity however it is much more common to make data public that you otherwise wouldnt many people might disagree with me on this one though.Lastly another good example is constructors the method that initializes a class data. You almost never use constructors in Unity in fact you cant for the most part but you use them everywhere in normal development.I hope this helps give you a decent idea of how it differs TLDR C is pretty much the same language in Unity but you often use it in a very different way.,Unity3D,cqfh1nk,20,t5_2qwj8

As for path finding and blocking it should be fairly easy since you have already tiled your map. One example is to just create a D array of bool and populate it with walkable truefalse info. Then create second D array for walkpath value say    ushort walkValues  new ushorttileSizeX tileSizeYThen start from the goal populate everything around it with  every tile around s to  etc. Also check all xy places if it is walkable from our bool if not then set value to or leave null. Now when enemy checks where to move he moves to value which is n where n is value he is standing. I drew you an image with my super mspaint skills since Im bad at explaining stuff. I failed bit with numbering but you should get the idea. Also it should be easy to fix if you want enemies to move only horizontal OR vertical and not both at the same time.This type of path finding had a name but I just cant remember it..,Unity3D,cqku869,2,t5_2qwj8

3820290,0,t1_cqr6hlk,I can give you a brief about where Im thinking on a worldbuilding front albeit not terribly concrete yet. Its a sort of apocalyptic setting on a world orbiting a star entering its red giant phase. You will be taking the role in a series of vignettes as i have things planned atm of an ancient machine from one of the synthetic civilizations of the past reawakening by happenstance to a crumbling planet still inhabited by other sparse mechanical life forms quotes due to the sort of necessary ambiguity of organicsyntheticmechanical etc. being terms that are defined in relationship to human lifecivilization which is looooong past gone in this temporal context.Anywho Im keeping the specific details of the context very handwavy as theyre importantly unimportant to the play experience as I envision it. The important part is that youre this creature that has awoken in a harsh context encountering other life forms and interacting with their situation with the last bits of your life. Being an ancient construct that has laid dormant on some sort of reserve power you have very little time left to you now that you have reactivated.To use genre terminology for the intended mechanicspace its going to be a melange of simpuzzlephysicssome action. Im working towards a format of  minute experiences each being a different construct a different situation. Sort of microopenworlds with next to no explicit instruction to the player. You will be left to figure things out yourself.So that might have all made sense maybe not.

Due to your comment on running into issues with multiple copies of each script I am assuming that you only need a single instance of your script. If that is the case I recommend doing the following. Put the script on an empty game object that only exists once within your scene.. Create a public variable for the new game object well call it emptyGameObject and attach the empty game object to it through the inspector. . Access the script by calling     exampleTwo  emptyGameObject.GetComponentltExamplegtNote Instead of the public variable approach you could do    GameObject.FindNameOfGameObject.GetComponentltExamplegt but I believe that the find method can have some perf impacts.Disclaimer This is a recommendation without knowing the content of your scripts.

Id need to store their positions as well the Balls rigid body settings and it might have a constant force component so Id need to check for that and store those values as well.I really have no idea how to go about this. I imagine it would be some type of for loop looping through all the children but theyre not all gonna have the same components like rigidbodies or certain scripts so Im not sure how to handle it.

It might look like FPS but really your just setting movement over time intervals.Moving your fixedupdate to a lower interval will cause physics calculations which mostly happen in on the fixedupdate interval to occur more often.

Never implemented something like that before might give it a go  plus you could be selective with the applied updates when rewinding so you could create some really cool mixed time effects!,Unity3D,ctknpkc,1,t5_2qwj8

For example  would only match a three or four digit number. Its true that the greedy symbol would also get you this but the number could be any size.Additionally the brackets could be used to write a validation pattern of sxs  this would check the that resolution is supplied and is in a valid format.,Unity3D,cu0al89,2,t5_2qwj8

Destroy col.gameObject            DestroygameObject            mechanicsScript.SetCountText            mechanicsScript.deadPlayers            mechanicsScript.checkPlayersIf you look all of these methods are called every single if statement.

4890784,0,t1_cuacsri,Thanks for posting this! While I was already moving in this direction with this thread I think this is the single post that persuaded me that the way to go in Unity is to simply step outside of the MonoBehaviour system and manage these things myself. Its a shame that Unity doesnt support these workflows better themselves  I imagine it would do a lot of good for new users  but its great that the ability to do these things exists.I had already over the last month or so been trying to do something a bit like this myself except for some reason it hadnt clicked that I could entirely step outside of MonoBehaviours so I was basically trying to deal with Entity classes that wrapped GameObject and Behaviour classes that wrapped MonoBehaviour. I think it just felt wrong somehow to entirely abandon those but this thread has showed me that real live actual experienced developers do just that and that I wouldnt be crazy to try it and thats very freeing.Its Ludum Dare in  hours and Im going to throw myself into that using Unity and try and roll my own Entity system live as part of the Jam just to try and get a feel for it. After that Ill see if I want to use either Entitas StangeIoC or a custom system.Seeing as this turned into such a large discussion with a lot of great stuff in it I think I may do a followup hereswhatIlearned post at some point over the next week.,Unity3D,cub0ta1,2,t5_2qwj8

5037235,0,t3_3jujnt,I dont think they are using splat maps in the way terrain uses splat maps.  The splat shapes they use are very specific so I dont think its a low resolution mask modulated by a tiling splatter texture.What I think they might be doing is rendering decals to a second uv channel on the environment model. First you render your world geometry to a render texture but use a second set of uvs as the position instead of the usual position  mvp matrix the pixel shader renders the world position. Now you have a texture of the world position of your environment geo.  You generate your new deferred decal data position normal tangent binormal size and blit new splats into your last splat texture ping pong buffer using the world position texture to tell where the decals are supposed to be.  You could use the same shader code that you use to render deferred decals without having to figure out the world position from a depth buffer.  Depending on the size of your world and the size of your texture you could get pretty detailed splat shapes like they do in splatoon.  Treat your splat decals like a signed distance field to make the ink edges smooth but not blurry.  Then you can mip the splat texture down to a x and check the color to see which team won the match! ,Unity3D,cut6fj4,2,t5_2qwj8

This means that the C objects your window has are invalidated because the native objects they refer to are destroyed. But you can use the old C objects to get references to the new ones     is the target destroyed? note that this wont work if the reference is actually null.    ifserializedObject.targetObject  null          int id  serializedObject.targetObject.GetInstanceID        Object targetObject  EditorUtility.InstanceIDToObjectid        iftargetObject ! null             serializedObject  new SerializedObjecttargetObject             recreate your SerializedProperty here                 else the object is gone for good    I like to do this check at the top of every event that uses the SerializedObject because the object could be destroyed at any moment by the user or otherwise. Be careful that your targetObject isnt actually null dont forget to handle the case where the object is permanently destroyed and of course if your SerializedObject has multiple targetObjects you will have to do this for every element in that array.,Unity3D,cx9ap52,2,t5_2qwj8

You want each Bob to run some code each frame so we look at two optionsA Giving Bob an Update function and letting Unity do its thing.B Giving Bob a CustomUpdate function and giving Jim an array of Bobs. Jim has an Update function that runs the CustomUpdate of every Bob.What I think the example is trying to show is that B is faster than A because it reduces the number of times that unitys C has to call C functions which is slower than C calling C functions.I hope Im not misunderstanding this too.,Unity3D,cy97i0o,4,t5_2qwj8

6064268,0,t1_cye2ga7,When working with Unity you should be no stranger to this basic principle of composition as Unitys scripting is based on it. Doesnt mean you cannot write your game classes using deep inheritance but I strongly recommend going this more modern modular approach.In short Divide functionality into small components that only do their job. Make them work together to create a logical object player car enemy tree. Do not write classes Player Car Enemy Tree. Write components.,Unity3D,cyeio4d,1,t5_2qwj8

I would either  Start with a variable initialized with the total count of packages you start with and subtract as you lose each one  or if you maintain a list of packages in the basket and remove them from the list as you lose them then you could get the length of the list at the end OR if you child the packages to the basket then you could just count the children of the basketLike I said depends on your setup,Unity3D,cyenphe,1,t5_2qwj8

Looking around for that warning it seems to come up mainly when the animator youre setting the bool on isnt ready which should only happen on the frame the gameobject is activated.

6308351,0,t1_cz6kouy,gt Again that has nothing to do with this.And what is that and what is this and which again are you referring to here?Your argument boils down to this The IDE makes it feasible to organize code in a single file. Therefore putting all the code in a single file is a valid approach.Assuming that the IDE does help in that regard it doesnt but more on that later it still doesnt make it a good idea. Modern medicine makes it perfectly feasible for one to fully recover from shooting ones self in the foot but that still doesnt make it a good idea.And the IDE will actually fight against having a monolithic source file. Resharper and CodeRush will go nuts with squiggly lines begging you to move each type into its own file. And if you use the IDE to create a new class it will default to adding a new file for it which you will then have to manually move into your monolith.cs.Your counter argument here is that one file doesnt mean one class and that you can have as many classes as you want in a single file. That is true but then again why not have those classes in their own separate files? What are you gaining here? Its definitely not readability as smaller files are easier to browse and fit in ones brain. Its definitely not usability as youll have to copy and paste a reusable class between projects instead of copying a single file or checking it out of source control.What is it youre trying to accomplish other than proving that it can be done? Because we all agree  that it definitely can be done.,Unity3D,cz6osw7,3,t5_2qwj8

To me the fun part wasnt really the idea thats sort of work and discipline making the gameplay work right and scale right.The fun part is tweaking out Unity until it WILL run  independent bots with rigidbodies behavior sounds animation etc. all at the same time at acceptable frame rates or  bots at upwards of  fps. I learned an awful lot doing this. Im going to be writing blogposts on Gamasutra text and graphics not video I read that post here! about some of the stuff I learned.Sometimes its just little victories like learning that I had to fire Shuriken only on a FixedUpdate with Emit to keep it from getting weird. Which gave me two choices of fire rate  fps or  fps or lower since I revised the tick of the physics engine to get it to work. Which meant I absolutely had to code interpolation in Update to get everything up to and including the player camera dolly moving smoothly that stuff can be a super pain but coming up with the answers and seeing them work is a LOT of fun.You can see some of that in the video though actual gameplay is way way smoother and more impressive its very hard to put fast wireframe footage on youtube compression absolutely wrecks it,Unity3D,czi5si1,2,t5_2qwj8

6652069,0,t1_d07ce13,I suppose thats a fair reason though I dont think you mean financially P.I have not actually tried to use C sockets in Unity however I am told that it will work  Sockets are how you establish a connection and are able to send binary data.  There is no smooth interface between JavaC.  You are going to write your own library for state synchonization and sending data over this socket connection.  As for serialization just be careful that C serializes data is the same way you deserialize it on the java side and viceversa.That is why I would suggest using a standalone Unity server as writing all of this lowlevel networking code manually is going to seriously take away from development time of the game.  You will constantly be adding features and fixing serious bugs with this custom library something that you wouldnt have to worry about nearly as much with an already functioning library.,Unity3D,d07dqri,2,t5_2qwj8
6652722,0,t1_d07fyne,Without seeing your other code you presumably have a call to that method somewhere correct? And you only want that to happen in the unity editor. When you compile to mobile for example your code still expects to call that method but unity wont have included it as it is no longer in the editor environment. Therefore that symbol wont be found.So dont wrap the method definition but the call in the if statement.EDITDoes your code currently look something like this?    void Update     PrintSomething        if UNITYEDITOR    void PrintSomething     Debug.LogHello World!        endifAssuming this is the case on any platform PrintSomething is trying to be called every frame but the method is only included in the Unity Editor whereas in the below example the method is included on every platform which is fine but is only called when you are running in the unity editor.    void Update     if UNITYEDITOR    PrintSomething    endif        void PrintSomething     Debug.LogHello World!    ,Unity3D,d07g6bf,2,t5_2qwj8

6687960,0,t1_d0aitte,I have a public InputManager class which inherit from MonoBehaviour.  It has a bunch of static variables and methods as well as MBs methods Update Awake.... For example force applied by the player custom gamepad is gathered in Update and stored in a static variable.

6707260,0,t1_d0d2lja,Thank you! Ive explained in detail in another comment but the main reason is because I wanted the player to have the option of choosing which word they are actually targeting. Ive played other typing games where this isnt an option and it always annoyed me when two words both starting with the same letter would appear on screen and Id start to type one but would be locked into typing the other. An example can be found in this Gif where Ive typed Ma when both Maize and Madame were on the screen. My current method recognises both words until the current input string no longer matches the recognised words. Therefore in this case I would have been able to choose either Maize or Madame whereas in other typing games I would have only been able to finish off typing Maize. The done key makes it so the player can decide when they want to shoot at a word. It also clears the current inputted text allowing for a quick text restart when the first letter was typed incorrectly. I also tried to place the done key where the space bar would go so it would simulate typing a bit better too.,Unity3D,d0d36t1,5,t5_2qwj8
6707611,0,t1_d0d3klw,That definitely seems to be the consensus among everyone here.

6724914,0,t1_d0ewpdt,My mistake I thought that was the functionality you were looking for.  In that case here is what you will want to do    private boolean counterActive  false    void Update        if Input.GetMouseButtonDown        counterActive  true            if timeRemaining gt  ampamp counterActive  true                              Debug.LogWaitting...  timeRemaining            timeRemaining  Time.deltaTime            if timeRemaining lt                             inventory.AddItem                DestroygameObject                        Furthermore you could add some code to set the counterActive variable to false if you ever want to pause the timer.The way it works is that when you press the mouse button it sets the boolean counterActive to true.  This boolean will keep the value true even after the player releases the mouse button.  Since the new condition for your timer is to check this boolean variable rather than to check the current status of the mouse button the counter will continue to do its thing even when the player releases the mouse.,Unity3D,d0ewxn7,2,t5_2qwj8

The actual textures will be difficult but you can colour the faces with materials as a temp measure maybe. I focus on a lowpoly origami kind of style so I cant recommend anyone who does that stylized look you get in the clash games  but if you are interested in who I learnt from then search for PigArt on YouTube  if nothing else  the simplicity of it may help you learn the basics. One other thing  dont just limit yourself to tutorials.  Watch speed modelling videos too.

6882321,0,t1_d0wd70k,a noble pursuit! I likewise think programming is effectively a borg pursuit. It is pointless clinging to passion and paradigm when fundamentally the point is to improve your ability. So lets talk workflow. Firstly I understand your stance. but like anything there are right and wrong approaches. Foremost most Custom Editors stem from the origin of either wouldnt it be cool if or Id like to be able to press a button and have magic happen.These lead to more time being spent on an editor than on the actual code they are controlling....One of the few exceptions is the context of a heavily artlead team or an asset you intend to sell. WHY this is different and important is when you talk script SCOPE. a single script performs a single task most successful editor scripts are actually about managing a module. a number of scripts that have to talk to each other to complete a common goal. the advantage of a custom editor means you can have the editor give feedback on the state of its connections not just itself. In one of my examples above the custom graph. you can travel from nodegraph and back. editing either or both. picture those as isolated scripts the architectural requirement that a graph manages node relations  may not gel with the editor concept of well i  just want to create some nodes. It is hard to abstract the need for a parent graph. to perform the code connections required to create graph edges when you are dealing with isolated scripts. what do you do? add references between them? is that REALLY a solution? Couple them?. SOLID principles be damned?So I code in a very modular fashion. having  years as a systems architect I have experience scaling a project and tend to design for that intent. so taking the base requirement ofgt Create a sphere of X items then on button press interpolate their positions into a circle orbiting the player.....I create a skeleton pseudocode that does the complete life cycle AZ. only all it does is print lines throughout. once the logic works I give myself a requirement change lets say the first shape is now a cube instead and instead of lerping we want a spherical lerp. already we have  points of change....but there are more. so now with a completed example I ask myself what my algorithm is. i pseudocode the one i can literally read in my code then alter pieces one by one ask myself how to add feature X change feature Y. and look for algorithm elasticity. in the end you realize you are really just performing simple data manipulation. so something really abstract like            interface IMover     bool MoveTransform actorVector destination              interface IItemCreator     Transform Create              interface IPointGenerator    IEnumerableltVectorgt GetPointsint amount              interface IInput                              bool Pressed  get                   bool Held  get                   bool Released  get                                 interface IActorCommand    void ExecuteGameObject actor void Undo etc...now i can have a top level IInput fire a command the input can change in fact i have a IInput decorator that turns any input key button etc into a chargeactivatemulticlick to activate another for combos etc so can the command. on the current command we are talking about i have a generator create points an itemcreator create the items for the points and a mover to lerp tween teleport animate...WHATEVER the items to their destination. The saline points here. . I started abstracting AFTER I had at least  complete end to end examples. an understanding of the use case. It should really be  but hey experiences buys you a little bit of corner cutting. I only create the implementations i need. I conceptualize as many as i can so i can see where design choices break but i dont waste time on hypotheticals. Try not to get distracted from your objective.. All in code. no editors. in fact all in c. no monobehaviours nothing unity specific bar references to UnityEngine namespace to reference transforms and vectors.. once i have working scripts that have nothing to do with unity i create a parent script. a provider of the interface type. so a Mover a ItemCreator a InputProvider etc. all it does is implement the interface and hold a reference to a same type. why? so that even though other scripts can call a GetComponentltIMovergt they are getting a type of my choosing. one i can swap out without the other components ever knowing I avoid null issues with the NullObjectPattern. so NOW i have a single master script its sole goal in life is as a Factory pattern for all the interface implementations. This is where I introduce a custom editor ...if i intend to hand it off to others. a simple visualizer for the factory pattern. coders can just instantiate pass references etc. all the code is unity agnostic. ,Unity3D,d0wfdk9,2,t5_2qwj8

Ill definitely take a look at Altos Adventure and see what I can glean from that.gtId like to feel like I was a pro rocket pilot even if I was not fab at the game. When I drift around a corner I want to think fuck me that was a close one but I made it! I must be good at this game! even if its because you have secretly made it easy for me.Thats the feeling I want the player to have  After playtesting it a bunch though I may have made it a bit TOO hard! Theres a few ways I could solve it like having the track start wider and shrink over time or make the hairpins bulge out a bit wider to allow more drifting. I might also experiment with zooming the camera out the faster the ship goes so that the player can see whats coming up a bit although I dont have too much zoom range before the player gets too hard to see.gt maybe have occasional space bandits chasing youHa thats a pretty good idea. Its interesting how a few more game mechanics become possible once the game becomes just a tad bit easier  It would look pretty cool if you have to outrun the enemies while they are sliding and exploding into corners.Well I think I know what Im working on this week  time for a pot of coffee!Edit after your edit gtI think sometimes I need to thrust and steer at the same time but atm you can do only one or the other.So the game has a feature that when you let off the thrust the ship actually can still be steered a bit with some invisible thrust vectoring thats being applied to the ship. However I kept it very subtle because I wanted the game to be hard but I think its way too subtle. I can crank up the torque that is being applied to the ship when your not boosting and I think Ill also add in some extra effects to make it more obvious that when you are not boosting you still have some control over the ship. ,Unity3D,d1kd6r5,1,t5_2qwj8

7210778,0,t1_d1xoxcg,I have to say its pretty addictive and I really like how it feels to play. AI is also pretty solid from what I saw not too weak and not strong enough to feel impossible to kill or sneak up on. I saw your other comment about it being Artificial Unintelligence but honestly it feels like it works good enough to use for a game like this. Sure an AI upgrade would probably make things a bit better but as a player I have no problem with it as it is right now.My regular FPS counter program thingy refused to show up so this is based on experience only.  Using a PC with a GTX  GPU and a FX CPU at x playing for  minutes each time   Fastest No problems at all. Fast No problems at all everything still felt fluid and nice. Simple Still no problems at all. Good Still no problems at all. Beautiful Chopped once or twice in  minutes still fully playable. I would not notice if I wasnt looking for it. Fantastic Pretty much same as beautiful. Noticed lag for the first time though which is not a plus  FantasticNoVsync Similar to Fantastic. I tried it twice and the first time I tried it it felt about the same as Fantastic. Second time I tried it I noticed lag when firing getting fired at or while movingspinning quickly and such. Heres also the point where I started to feel that it become a bit harder to aim. FantasticDoubleVsync Shots at least the sound grouped together a bit playing in bursts. It also became hard enough to aim under fire that I had to stop shooting while aiming to keep hitting like I did at previous settings. Still playable but not enjoyable to the degree that Id see myself keep playing if I had to use FantasticDoubleVsync.I dont think I missed anything and I really enjoyed playing it. I also noticed that you had bound the mouse wheel to sprint something I liked.After playing for  minutes total I still like the game and Im not in any way tired of the gameplay.The only things I can come up with to complain about so far It felt a bit weird to me that I kept my movementspeed while shooting instead of slowing down but I quickly got used to it. Id like to be able to shoot while sprinting but with lower accuracy as sprinting right now felt a bit interruptive and I didnt use it as much as Id like to.Both of these are however just personal opinion and overall you made a game that was both visually pleasing and fun to the point where Ill probably play it again just because I liked it.This is in no way a complete review or anything like that but I didnt have anything better to do right now so I figured I might as well write a complete answer. Im going to sleep now but if you have any other questions feel free to ask either here or in a PM and Ill try to answer them within h.Also please send me a PM with the last build when you stop working on it. Id love to play it again when its finished.,Unity3D,d1xt545,2,t5_2qwj8

When testing in Play mode in the editor the warp is very pronounced and obvious.The warping does have a purpose which is to compensate for the distortion that occurs when you look through the cardboard lenses. The extent of the warp will differ with different versions of Cardboard devices but if you use headsets built on the Google standard for Cardboard . amp . it should be pretty much unnoticeable.

The issue with that is if you go back and look at my script the problem is the body and head HMD are always kept in sync together.

7680633,0,t3_4kiwsw,Provided the XML files are in your Assets folder i.e. in your Project view in the Editor they will be packaged into Unitys own data storage format upon building the game. This means their contents wont be accessible anymore to users at least not without a lot of technical wizardry.Another option that comes to mind is to look into Unitys somewhat overlooked ScriptableObject functionality. Deriving a new class from ScriptableObject allows you to create what is essentially a new type of asset tailored exactly to your needs. Much like an XML file or some other serialized file type its primary goal is to store data but then with the added advantages of also being able to call functions on it and having a custom editor right inside Unity. Rather than creating and maintaining a cumbersome database in a single text file you could just as well create a new type of ScriptableObject say MonsterStats keep all different instances together in a folder in your project and create edit and dragndrop them in the same way as you do your textures or audio clips.,Unity3D,d3f8plp,3,t5_2qwj8

Same for a new reference type.The actual issue was that the bool return value of the MoveNext call was being boxed due to the embedding API for our scripting engine always returning an object. The fix was to adjust how we called MoveNext to avoid this boxing.tldr Coroutines after allocating the initial enumerator object will now only allocate if the user code allocates again returning a value type or a new reference type.,Unity3D,d3kccjo,3,t5_2qwj8

If you are using a screen spaced AA effect such as the standard effects or cinematic effects options it should try to blur that out  though the artifacts may still be there slightly.MSAA normal antialiasing in forward rendering only doesnt multisample at certain transitions  such as shadows or fog.

7810282,0,t1_d3tljeg,Okay heres how I understand it.Youre loading the LevelManager somehow probably in response to selecting a level in the UI.Once the LevelManager loads it needs to cache some UI element references. So it likely has a line like this    avoid Awake         myDiagNam  GameObject.FindMyDiagName.GetComponentampltTextgt        myDiagBody ....However for some reason the myDiagName and myDiagBody fields are not getting set. This is despite the fact that the MyDiagName GameObject has a Text component.The nature of the error you first posted about was that you were trying to set a field using an object of the wrong type. It said cannot implicitly convert from GameObject to Text. This usually means you have a variable of type Text and you try to use and object of type GameObject in it. However Im not seeing any part of your code that would produce this error. That would lead me to believe that the error is somewhere else in your code and the failure to cache the UI elements is just a symptom of the problem.I noticed that you have a myDialogue field in the LevelManager with type GameObject. Do you at any point use this field as though it were a Text? That would be my first guess on where to start looking.,Unity3D,d3txum8,1,t5_2qwj8

That said in the scriptingpainting side that tile is still considered to cover only one cell so it is a hack.We feel like the upside for supporting varying sizes isnt big enough for the complexity it brings. You can always just split the x in three pieces and also use our scriptable tiling system to aid you by having just one tile which outputs  different sprites side by side.

Your core looks like a microcontroller so it would be funny if everything there looks like a circuit board.

8267592,0,t1_d5awk2h,Well while k is a lot that can still be a low bar in some cases.

So I am pretty close to the k mark. Its not using the resources system for these prefabs nor is it a mobile game so its probably a non issue for me atm. But...What I do love about unity so far is someone out there thought it would be useful to the rest of us to know about this performance issue with k objects on low end mobile devices. I love how much random info about performance is out there for unity. I hate having a problem and having to dig around for hours in profilers to locate what I did wrong.

Its a little easier to Notify once than call back all your event listeners.For example I have an OnGameVictory event that makes all the players units start to dance and I keep the dance code out of the Scenario class. Its little stuff like that that helps keep code clean.Dont do it though unless you see a situation where a lot of your game objects want to be notified of something.

If you are fine with c it will only take a day of watching some academic tutorials about fuzzy ai and tataaa you are using Fuzzy in your game. It can very well be used in FPS games for enemy AI  on some steering behavior where AI doesnt cheat as knowing all the navmesh before hand etc. It might be expensive as CPU wise . Havent profiled it myself but honestly it is some maths for area calculations and checking bunch of if statements.Also a state machine can pretty much do anything you want easily without watching  day of academic tutorials DYour call.,Unity3D,d5y7rs7,1,t5_2qwj8

The rd option I like quite a lot actually  its like The demon girl next door fresh home from the asskicking gym.  Like workout clothes basically  bit more practical than the bikini bottom which generally is a style of clothes more worn for sex appeal than practicality imo.  If youll pardon the presumption I made a little edit to show what a difference it makes   The one with I guess basically boy shorts looks a fair amount more tame to me even though she still has very little on top.  The second image I was just curious how it would look  for what its worth my wife chimed in that she liked that one best though we both agreed it seemed more provocative than the first edit but she is a succubus after all.I think as long as you keep in mind the way its perceived everything else is looking quite nice though!,Unity3D,d6b4omu,2,t5_2qwj8

8698811,0,t1_d6si3v2,Hey! I have already worked on a few projectiles for Zheros. And the way it was set up was this the game would calculate the trajectory of the projectile in this case a curve and move the game object with the FX attached with it. So that the projectile could follow the target and leave smoke and a trail just like here.  Here for the tutorial I simply used an animation because well Im no programmer and because I wanted to focus on the FX.  If this was a skill shot in league for example I think it could be deliverable as it is of course itd need a lot of polish and more details but Im talking about it technically. The programmer would need to detect the collision with a potential target and Id then create the hit effect. And also the cast effect. pIf you have any other questions feel free!

I quite still dont get few things for example can any client call any command if it has one? does that mean that only clients can call commands and only server can RPC? and many more that I will get at the time when I will be actually working on that not sure whether its bad or good but I am reluctant to learn on the fly for now I am just working on generation system though I still need to have networking in mind.,Unity3D,d6xroli,1,t5_2qwj8

9100550,0,t3_54vq9z,Your material could be looking metallic because the specular map posted on that site is for Roughness which is the inverse of Smoothness which is what Unity uses.Unitys  MetallicSmoothness input in the Standard Shader reads Metallic from the R channel of a texture and Smoothness is read from the Alpha channel.In Photoshop try copypasting that Roughness map into the Alpha channel of a new image and hitting CtrlI to invert the Roughness into Smoothness. Then fill the RGB channels with black so it wont look metallic then save it as a bit TGA and plug it into your MetallicSmoothness input.Edit Clarity,Unity3D,d85qn6j,5,t5_2qwj8

9332615,0,t3_5874yh,I played it for a bit and here are my thoughtsthe controls are confusing  yes I got confused I thought at first that I need to tap on road where I want the bridge to shift it took me couple of tries before I figured that I use the leftright part of the screen to move it  I would change it to so you need to tap on the road section to snap the road into their.Its REALLY hard  I suggest lowering the car speed and let it build up as you play.I also had hard time to see the cars they dont stand out as much from the background.Another issue is the google play center or how ever its called I understand that you use it and its fine but it asked me to install it every time at the score screen which showed up a lot because it was really hard for me I suggest to ask it once per session.I would give the bridge part that moves a different look that will stand out from the rest of the road.And give the player  strikes or more before it is game over It ends too fast for me also because its hard and this way you can add some explosion particles for the car that drops and let the environment come into playOver all it could work as a game only needs some more polishing and player feedback,Unity3D,d8yz6ob,1,t5_2qwj8

9755983,0,t1_dafb2fg,Hey TheEpsilon! Not at all. This is only one small part of the development process. The knowledge needed for developing environments such as these is understanding the Unity UI using Unity scene editor effectively navigating the Unity asset store understanding scene composition lighting post processing effects and of course practicing all of these.

9774666,0,t1_dahted9,I was a little nervous at first  shaky hands  as Ive been flying and traveling for the past  hours to get here and to think that I would not pass after all of this was kind of scary.The test itself was straightforward following the courseware that is provided by unity so if you watch the videos through  about  hours  you should be get to go. The questions were divided into topic groups and you would get the result after finishing each group. When you answer a question you must move on to the next one and cant go back so theres no chance to review answers before finishing a group. Some of the questions were completely unrelated to Unity or game development  ex a question about copyrights .At the end of the test you get the final result   questions  points each . I think they may have suspected I was cheating or something as the server was disconnected several times for me throughout the test and the result I got was higher than usual.

9800993,0,t1_dakakvm,Its a particle with a shader performing the distortion.  A script drives the flap movement and rotation of the flame and the flame effect is identical at all throttle levelsjust scaled up and down based on the throttle amount with different ranges for diameter and length.  Shaders do the rest.  Something to note is that the shader I have onhand for heat distortion has issues with depthsorting if put very close to an additive surface such as a flame particle so I had to move it out into the tail of the flame to get the pretty effect you see here.Heres a pretty good YouTube walkthrough of how to achieve a very similar effect using only standard assets and a bit of normal map trickery.,Unity3D,dal6m82,2,t5_2qwj8
9801897,0,t1_dal9dmj,Yes. Im finding syncvars and hooks super useful and easy to use. Using multiple Qos channels makes mixing reliable and unreliable networking really easy.

If you come across something you dont understand say abstract classes in a coursegoogle it and read article after article until you come across an explanation that you will understand then move on. Another important tip do exercises imo a book comprised entirely of exercises and solutions is far more valuable than a book of explanations. You can Google the latter if need be. Through exercises or your own projects youll come across problems whose solutions probably lie in things you dont understand yet when youll apply those concepts to solve your own problems it will make it far easier and logical to understand some abstract concepts you struggle with.  Edit I dont know if youve ever learned a foreign language. For quite some time it seems like magic especially the first one you struggle you dont understand and cant express most things in it.

10609385,0,t1_dd9zzcc,System.Random is actually broken.It never properly implemented the algorithm it was based on which significantly lowered its periodrandomness. Microsoft knew about this in  but cant fix it as that would change the results of individual seeds which a lot of programs depend on. Its probably random enough for simple games but if random enough isnt good enough for you...Dont use either one of them. Use a custom generator there are a lot of algorithms out there that are both faster and more random than either UnityEngine.Random or System.Random. I recommend XoroShirop and PCG random.XoroShirop is an algorithm available in the Unity asset Make It Random which also has a metric boat load of other utilities. Ive talked to the creator of this asset and hes very responsive and passionate about random number generation. It also has a free version I believe with less features.If you prefer simpler implementations here is an implementation of XoroShirop and here is an implementation of PCG random.PCG itself has a website with a lot of useful data on this stuff which is interesting to read. XoroShiro is much faster but PCG has higher quality results. Both are more random than UnityEngine.Random or System.Random.,Unity3D,dda9zat,8,t5_2qwj8

10677957,0,t1_ddh8bps,First of all to answer your question Yes thats what I do at the moment for most parts. I tightly integrate scripts  their dialogs which means I have no generic dialoges at all. That way I cannot just ask for any numberstring because every sort of request already has its own UI prefab.Now I dont say that is good but it makes it easier to prototype for now.Advantages of very tight integration like I do very fast iterationprototyping direct control over everything no manager needed no indirection.For things like a main menu its perfect or a fixed special dialog like save game where you can have multiple save slots. Those things can never be generic because they are only ever used for one special purpose.Later I definitely need some generic way to query something from the user as well.I plan to have a simple text input dialog for strings optionally with some Funcltstring boolgt callback that lets me filter what is valid and what not filtering bad names or when only digits are allowed all symbols that are not digits ....The way I plan to do this is using coroutines I think.I dont want to deal with event handlers events registering and unregistering stuff I do that in WinForms but in Unity I feel its the wrong approach.Example how I imagine this will work in my game eventually    IEnumerator QueryStringFromUserstring title Funcltstring boolgt isValid Actionltstringgt onSuccessOrOk Action onFailOrCancel          spawn my generic dialog     yield return MyCustomOnChangeWaitThingdialog isModal false  inhert from CustomYieldInstruction     validate dialog with isValid here potentially modfy itplay an animation to indicate some error     if dialog.WasCancelPressed || ... close dialog     invoke the right delegate onSuccessonCancel fade out dialog  destroy     Now I have one coroutine that handles everything because in a way even my generic dialog is a special thing its specifically made to be generic... PI find dealing with explicit event registration is too dangerous myEvent  ... in unity as its often unclear when exactly objects really die for example maybe some things need to wait for a particle effect or Animator animation.That could cause leaks if Im not careful and a UI query dialog is not the time or place to think about efficiency and memory management P,Unity3D,ddhcmml,1,t5_2qwj8

10707173,0,t1_ddk44no,pixels per unit doesnt affect the actual texture size memory its just a reference value for how big a texel should be vs a UI unit. Id just change the texture size on the texture importer rather than changing the source art. There is no single resolution you can use really because mobile phones dont have a standard resolution. Rather you author to a size thats big enough for your raster images and let the mipsfiltering handle the difference. We tend to use multichannel signed distance fields for most of our UI elements  so resolution is less of an issue for us.

It just feels better to leave it in for when people want to start. Edit To be more clear I mean that anything can be replaced or modified in any way you see fit but taking a core part say the replay system and lifting it out is not really possible.All the other parts networking fog of war replays etc. are all interconnected and tied together because it is a complete game and is intended to be build upon not to take one part here and one part there. What you are saying here is one of the things I was afraid of basically that it will be thought of as a bunch of assets put together when it really is a complete game engine that you can build on and modify to make your own.It will obviously be sold with source code to everything.,Unity3D,ddnoj57,1,t5_2qwj8

My point bitbucket is a great service and apparently u are adding more value into it but UX is still somewhat clunky. You may want to not alienate your old users by degrading the interface but we have a pinned thread here in rUnityD to teach people how to use source control it is a short one nonetheless.

11226415,0,t1_df4hufs,A projector and a deferred decal work very very differently.  A projector will determine which objects its projecting onto render those objects it will then take the finished render of those objects and rerender them with a custom shader that will project the texture onto the rendered object.  So yes its implemented as a shader with a bit of magic in the Unity engine to support doing that.I dont think Unity supported them at all but deferred decals work in a similar but much more efficient way.  A deferred decal will wait until the entire scene is rendered into the gbuffer and then project in screen space.  It doesnt require any special support from the engine or to rerender any objects like projectors do it does everything in screen space in the gbuffer and are by comparison much much faster.  You can litter you scene with hundreds of these things which would absolutely murder performance if youre using projectors.I only mention all this because I doubt theyre using unitystyle projectors.  They can be exceedingly slow since everything they touch has to be rendered twice.  Want a projector on your terrain?  Great get ready to render that entire terrain twice because your RTS unit wanted a circle at its feet or something.  Its a massive waste of fillrate and with a game like For Honor with complex environments and a presumably modern rendering engine I just dont think theyd use such a primitive method of drawing a circle on the ground.,Unity3D,df4i034,9,t5_2qwj8

11540126,0,t3_64ilv1,Hmm Fuzzy Having a frizzy fluffy or frayed texture or appearance would be more fitting for the character. Seriously though thats actually quite an amazing game there.

11553242,0,t1_dg4vba2,Yes exactly. The most common examples would be if you are making yet another voxel game to render the voxel field as a smooth surface and not cubesblocks like minecracft or if you are doing some voxel fluid simulation.Of course there are other options like rendering medical data but this is not really for a standard unity developer I guess. ,Unity3D,dg5kasi,1,t5_2qwj8
11554345,0,t3_64r5rz,Hello guys ! Thanks for your replies ! We are really happy to see that much feedback !Animations are gonna be remade soon currently they are a bit dated because we have been learning as we were working on the project. As for weapons we showed you only a few of them. We tried to design them to look like toys but some of them like the tommygun for example need a new design to accentuate this feeling.In this trailer we wanted to show the action part of the game but its mainly an adventure game as there is a lot of exploration platforming items to find characters to meet quests to complete and abilities to unlock.Soon we will show you more of the game and the gameplay itself !,Unity3D,dg5ot0z,2,t5_2qwj8

11563244,0,t1_dg6mth3,Thanks good suggestions. I wasnt aware of the existence of static constructors so that is a big tip for me.Im not concerned about the use of strings with my present scope while I understand the problem I am working alone and on small projects but its good to keep that in mind besides.Utility wise if you are interested in clarification is to assist with the organisation of dynamically instantiated gameobjects inside the  Hierarchy view. Typically new objects are placed on the root level potentially creating a lot of clutter. This method simplifies nesting those new objects into a tree primarily to reduce the clutter but also to make it easier to locate and analyse any dynamically created object.Thanks again.,Unity3D,dg6p5wt,1,t5_2qwj8

11652798,0,t3_669p2t,Those image effects you are showing are outdated in . and even with . you can should use the new ones since release actually. Use post processing stack instead Not sure how the rest of the tutorial applies then.Somewhat related on mobile youd want to avoid this effect and just fake it see Chameleon Run as an example.,Unity3D,dgguxri,10,t5_2qwj8

I see two different representations of the elements a lot of people wont understand the kanji symbols and am unsure why there are different ways f showing them and what is happening at that point. I do like the layout and the colour although I would try and retain consistency in the width of the grid. in the top image the right column of the grid is wider than in the other screenshots.  I would also like to see how you get the other heroes in the game. is this all part of a campaign or do you have a character select screen? or is it random?,Unity3D,dgjaa0o,1,t5_2qwj8

11767582,0,t3_67wo2o,If Im understanding this page correctly only byte int float and string can be a SyncVar. And it looks like youre trying to make your custom class variable Teams into a SyncVar which doesnt work. Instead of taking from the teams array and putting it into selectedTeam maybe you could have a SyncVar int with a hook and in the hook function you do selectedTeam  teamsteamID. Im assuming that is what is going on here I didnt fully read your codeExample in case I am horrible at explaining     public Teams teams     public Teams selectedTeam     SyncVarhookOnTeamSelect public int selectedTeamID     void OnTeamSelectint t          selectedTeamID  t hooks are like overrides so we need to sync it manually like so         selectedTeam  teamsselectedTeamID IIRC arrays start at  so your teams would range from . Or if thats confusing you could just do selectedTeamID so you could type it in without confusion but it would still be  when its all done.              Command     void CmdSelectNewTeamint newSelectedTeamID          selectedTeamID  newSelectedTeamID changing selectedTeamID triggers the hook     IIRC SyncVars are kind of like an automatic ClientRPC. Thats why Im changing it in a Cmd because the server doesnt receive ClientRPCs it can only send them. If it wasnt done thru a Cmd the server would be out of sync with the clients. again IIRC. Someone correct me if Im wrongThere could be more wrong with your code but thats the first thing I noticed and it may work as you want when that is fixed.,Unity3D,dgtvwkt,3,t5_2qwj8
