359465,0,t3_1xp3wi,There are plenty of companies that can generate marketing lists for you based on criteria you provide to them. Some are more accurate than others as data in this space is often a moving target since people leave organizations data is sourced by customers amp communities or the data is mined from the web. zoominfo iprofile icontact onesource rainking netprospex data.com aka jigsaw etc. some require that you purchase a license to the data while others will build the specific list and you pay per contactemail. there is definitely a downside to purchasing lists especially if you plan on using a third party to send the email such as mailchimp or constant contacts considering that high bounce rates can get you flagged as a spammer and ultimately suspended as those services require your lists be optin. some such as rainking provide phone numbers which are fairly accurate. depending on the means of communication each service has their strengths and weaknesses. ,salesforce,cfi0weq,1,t5_2qmo8

I linked it to object  and saved it and the amount field was set  object.amount.However what Im trying to do is create an freeform field that is populated by default with object.amount.So if I go to the tab of object it gives you the choice to create a new record then select parent object. You do that then this next field object.amount is populated with the value of object.amount.Right now the formula field works but doesnt appear on the layout when creating a new object record. It only shows up when I create a new object record select an object parent record and then save.Ill dig some more into it maybe its a flow thing..

I liked the people the role and the company but I started to feel stifled over time.Every quarter I update my resume with my latest accomplishments. Once I updated my resume to reflect my Salesforce administration and implementation experience the calls and emails started and havent stopped since.The fact is that you have a highly marketable skill set and your employer needs to recognize that. A quick search on Glassdoor shows that the average Salesforce Administrator makes  per year. Now that data is not always the most accurate but it gives you an idea of where you can be.Like you said you live in an expensive city which means that you can get paid even more than the national average.Here is what I suggest update your resume and online profiles i.e. LinkedIn so that it is a Salesforce resume and wait.You wont have to wait long before you start getting inbound calls and emails from recruiters wanting to interview you especially if you have good experience already. At the end of the day your company doesnt care about you. They care about themselves. Now they may ALSO care about you but their primary focus of most companies is unfortunately on the company.Ive seen it happen where one company acquires another company and fires a bunch of people. In fact Ive seen it happen more than once. If they can fire you at any moment you can fire them at any moment. Ultimately you must take ownership of your own career.Like someone else said you could love your new job too! There are lots of great people working at lots of great companies. And frankly if youre presented with a compelling opportunity its on you if you dont take it. For example I increased my salary from k to k  got a new title Senior Salesforce Administrator and negotiated a sixmonth review to talk about a raise instead of waiting a year.Theres a lot of opportunity out there if you look for it.Now Im not saying to quit your job tomorrow if someone offers you a Salesforce gig.

9080599,0,t1_d83bgoz,i dont see there being a lot of standard controller functionality making something pretty ajaxy and probably heavy with the visualforce remoting mix of client and server side validation. ive written a couple templates but it seems like a mixed bag imo. theres includes and then theres templating. im not exactly sure how session variables or stored info would work like getting permissions for the navigation as well as the main content when theyre different classes  pages. it tends to go towards developing every page independently and then using the defined regions to say nav goes here,salesforce,d83c9r6,1,t5_2qmo8

9180325,0,t3_56296p,My idea is that there is a field on the contact which the criteria rules are based on and we populate that field based on Flows made in the Process Builder. The sharing rule for one public group department would grant access if the Field contains the name of their department. i.e dept would only get access if the Access Stamp field contains dept. The Flows would evaluate the criteria and then update that field appropriately with a new value. To keep things simple in the flow each flowrule would only add the name of the department to the field and an Apex trigger would handle the string concatenation so as not to lose the current values.Example Access Stamp   Student Application submitted Flow to update the Access Stamp to APP Apex string logic runs Access Stamp  APP Student signs up to the Open Day Flow to update the Access stamp to Recruitment Apex string logic runs Access Stamp  APPRecruitment Student opts out of Recruitment engagement Flow updates Access stamp to Recruitment Apex string logic runs Access Stamp  APP,salesforce,d8fo914,1,t5_2qmo8
9248350,0,t3_56z8gh,Ill echo everyone elses opinions here.. Didnt get as much value out of this year as last and the crowds were awful.I had the opportunity to spend about  hours one day with two of our account managers which was super valuable.Other than that? Meh the Cloud Expo was horrible. I came with intentions to find solutions to two problems and to spend a good amount of money to solve them. Left with no solutions.Some of the CIOfocused sessions were good and a few developer ones gave me some ideas but not nearly as informative or motivating as prior years.I think the biggest problem was flat out overcrowding. I felt myself wanting to just go back to my hotel and watch the keynotes online than bother with all the people.The biggest draw of Dreamforce in years past would be the feeling you get when you come back into the office Monday morning full of ideas and solutions. I didnt feel any of that this year. Just pure exhaustion.,salesforce,d8oaoeu,2,t5_2qmo8

9797068,0,t1_dajpw6v,In this case its been happening more and more often and it would really make our data cleaner which is why Im considering it. Im not exactly sure how OLIs work but what might help the situation is that we dont currently use the Opportunity Amount field. Thats because we track so many different amounts and have custom fields that explain exactly which amount is what.The reason not to just do a custom object tickets and Ive thought of it is that then well still need a solution for hotel stays upgrades and other things that come up.Our margin on tickets is not a set amount or percentage and we dont usually find out exactly what it is until after booking each ticket. Thats something weve been tracking in a custom field until now.I think Im going to explore exactly how OLIs work and see if it makes sense for us.Thanks for your help so far!,salesforce,dakp7sr,1,t5_2qmo8
