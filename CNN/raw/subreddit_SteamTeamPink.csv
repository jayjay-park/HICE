1322051,0,t1_ciichf0,Shouldnt spend money on any tokens. I suggest saving your money for more useful things. We shall just just enjoy the competition and watch red steam roll everyone. Whats the chances of winning games anyway? The amount people spend on stealing tokens prob equal the amount their games on their wishlist cost.I personally enjoy people putting up YouTube videos and propaganda posters about us and the community we are building up with the Red team. I dont care about winning actually.,SteamTeamPink,ciicizl,2,t5_328uy
