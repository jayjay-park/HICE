10893635,0,t1_ddxhtk1,Im that streamer aka Tame. Brandon if you will.I did do a fundraiser. My PC was dying and I had the approval of some but not all of the streamers and made a big mistake by hosting a fundraiser. I raised  ish? Its been . years tbh with a personal cap of  to fix my PC or build a new one.My problem was that I did it without full backing out of abject desperation and I was also lying about my age was saying I was  years older than I was at the time. I got caught in a huge lie that stemmed back to me being a teenager and joining an  gaming community when I was . I was still friends with some of those people Bobito was one and so I felt like I had to keep up the lie I spun when I was just a kid.I was  at fault gave back the money and begged my grandma for a new PC. Grandma helped me out and I paid her back in full once I got a job.I screwed up but I never intended to hurt anyone. I loved the Vinesauce community genuinely and I talk  honestly now about the lies I told and how everything went down.Any of the streamers will tell you that I gave every cent back from the stream and felt so guilty that I literally cried in front of all the streamers on Skype. Im not sure what Alex bought with his donations but I did not buy a single thing nor spend a cent.Im willing to talk at length about this but I would never defend myself because I was a liar or talk poorly about the Vinesauce team because they were amazing.I miss streaming to this day so much that it feels like a piece of me is missing. I look back and feel more proud of who I was a liar with no job and no life than who I am home owner upper management cushy job with Verizon  just started in Jan! living with my wonderful girlfriend for  years on a daily basis and still struggle to come to terms with my own sense of it all. I dont think proud is the word actually. I think I had a problem with ego and fed off the minor celebrity to the point that I was almost intoxicated off of it. I miss that rush of clicking the live button and instantly having friends. I look back and view it as one of the biggest mistakes Ive made in life but I also used what I learned to set a precedent in how I treat others and to be an honest person now.If I could change the past I would in a heartbeat. Vin was a terribly understanding person to the point that I feel like it got him hurt sometimes and I abused his kindness. Towards the end of it all I tried putting hints to things in my profiles out of guilt. My profile tagline was You can fool some of the people all of the time... because a part of me genuinely wanted to be figured out so that I could face my own indolence. But bygones are bygones and I now lead a really boring and normal life.  job  days a week in suburbia.The cool part of this all? Ive learned so much about how to treat people and I gained so much support from the community that it was amazing. So many people told me they would miss me my personality etc even though it was based on a sham. That people could display such kindness to someone like me is still something that warms my heart.The uncool part? I miss my friends. I would love to just be able to sit on Skype again with Imakuni and play DotA until  am I would love to talk about life the universe and everything with Vinny. I miss KYs wit. I miss the familial bond I had with Joel. I ruined it all out of fear desperation and the inability to cope with who I was and I will always feel shame for that.,Vinesauce,de3lnlp,5,t5_2uks1
