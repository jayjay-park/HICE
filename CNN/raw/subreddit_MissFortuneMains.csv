10096097,0,t3_5keyey,Blitz If enemies hide behind creeps your Q will bounce on them. If they dont Blitz can pull them. Nice for zoning the lane.Leona Lots of disables...Nautilus A mix between the advantages of Blitz and Leona.,MissFortuneMains,dbnjbdh,2,t5_390hx
10416868,0,t1_dcopd4h,It should be but riot is known to give a fk about game experience when they say that they care so that is not one of their priorities I guess.The other option is that Riot games actually benefits from boosting services that are offered for big companies it may sound weird but they would get more profit the more games are played in the account and it would also explain why you can find so many pages about eloboosting just by googling eloboost where they even give player names but riot doesnt even try to investigate them.,MissFortuneMains,dcotj8m,1,t5_390hx
10579467,0,t1_dd5harq,shiv is bleh but firecannon or pd work on mf. you can either go full ad ult bot build on her or you can go penetration in to crit items and end up with like  crit which helps you dps tanks.something like ghostblade gt edge of night gt lord dominiks and then iepd in any order from that is a decent build you can try since it gives you strong earlymidgame while allowing you to scale too.,MissFortuneMains,dd76ucf,2,t5_390hx
10938435,0,t3_5w7elw,Im just going to copy this from another threadgt Basically the difference between nerfs isgt st verion the nocrit Qgt Bounce   level  of Q damage with  AD and lets say you backed and got  AD now. The damage on bounce is  at lvl  of Q.gt nd version Q with crit but no extra base damage on bouncegt Bounce with no crit  level  of Q with  AD and again with  AD and level  Q the damage is .gt Now crit does the same damage x which is  with  AD and  at  AD.gt I dont know about you guys but Ive met a lot of people who are actually hard to hit with the crit Q before level  so I have to poke them with the basic bounce and this is where the lane is won or lost most of the time. The removal of crit Q is not going to destroy MFs laning but this might hurt her quite a lot.To me it really seems like people overrate the Q crit. Ye it may be fun to play with but MF didnt have it before season  and still she was one of the strongest champs to play in soloq for climbing beacause of her kit.,MissFortuneMains,de8819f,2,t5_390hx
