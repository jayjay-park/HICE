6902572,0,t3_4aaakz,Scoobys calculator is my goto weight management tool. Its a perfect way to work out exactly what you need to do to achieve your goals. You can tweak the dietactivity levels to find out what suits you best and its exceedingly simple to use.Luckily for me Joylents roughly  calories hit the nail on the head for me to safely lose weight at my activity levels. Im a few weeks into  Joylent and my weight is plummeting but I have more energy and I feel amazing. Nutrition is relatively flexible so I dont think youd do yourself much harm by tweaking the Joylent quantity but personally I prefer to keep it simple. ,joylent,d0yq4bs,6,t5_32q4e

Like constantly.Im just wondering if anyone else has noticed this. Or any ideas about what might be causing it.,joylent,d6blb8y,1,t5_32q4e
9296693,0,t1_d8u14jf,This. Dont leave it out of the fridge for long. I personally bring Joylent unmixed to work and just add water from the cooler a few minutes before lunch. The shaker works just fine for the job.,joylent,d8uf7rd,2,t5_32q4e

10372389,0,t1_dcf3jm8,I contacted Joylent about how long I could safely keep joylent in the fridge and they said h. From personal experience I can tell that you can keep it a bit longer without anything tastingsmelling off but if you want to be careful h is the official limit.,joylent,dcjrtgm,1,t5_32q4e

10911451,0,t3_5vptrh,Vanilla Joylent with milk instead of water tastes pretty good imo it tastes a bit sweeter I think. I also enjoy it mixed with a mug of coffee and some milk instead of water. Tastes like a vanilla latte.,joylent,de5ft53,1,t5_32q4e
