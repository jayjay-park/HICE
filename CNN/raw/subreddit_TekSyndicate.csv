He always has some tidbit of anecdotes or facts which is really entertaining from a tech perspective. Hes an amazing addition to the tek I wish he put out more servernetwork homelab type videos.,TekSyndicate,d0xsobb,7,t5_2tplk

8919238,0,t1_d7jouy5,Im pretty sure he meant to ignore the PMs from hutch not to ignore the fact that someone is impersonating him because thats kind of a big freaking deal... Thats literally someone putting blame on him to presumably get him fired or possibly to cover someone elses tracks and let him take the fall for it or for some other reason we dont know about so yes lets just ignore the fact that the community nearly sent a guy to the chopping block to behead him because of an imposter.,TekSyndicate,d7jyn30,1,t5_2tplk

9138413,0,t1_d8abqdh,I think a good amount of people pulled support from TS and gave it to him for that reason. Logans explanation and claims made him look at fault and people wanted to support Qain to help him after leaving. Im personally looking forward to more content from Qain.
