6976812,0,t3_4b89y9,Ive done a bit of research and it seems that Crypti is not failed or abandoned like some are claiming but that no more development is being done and it is now in the hands of the community. Not sure where that leaves it. The new platform Lisk as i gather developed by some ex Crypti people  please correct me if Im wrong does seem to be remarkably similar. Is Sia going to be connected with Lisk in any way?,siacoin,d175r4z,1,t5_31qet

10076245,0,t3_5jrriw,Your search probably did not result in answers because Siafunds at the time of the crowdsale were called Sianotes. These were traded on the Nxt Asses Exchange and their sale announced hereThe Ask price for Sianotes were set to  NXT which at the time may  resulted in a total crowdsale valued at  BTC or  USD thats a rough approximation of course as BTC went through several price movements after this date. Maybe you can find the result of the crowdsale somewhere in that thread as Taek was posting and updating.The earliest Bitcointalk thread I know of is this which announced the deadline for redeeming Sianotes for Siafundsalso there are some notes on the redemtion process on the old Sia website here,siacoin,dbkyfg2,4,t5_31qet
