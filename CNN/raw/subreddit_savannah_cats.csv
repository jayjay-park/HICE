4134287,0,t1_crqt4xw,It was just a pill splitter and normal adult dramamine from somewhere like Walmart.  Half a pill each day.  Maybe the kids dosage will be the same.That vet is correct enough.  Most cats have an instinct to open their mouths when you push on the sides of their mouth e.g. near their jaw hinge.  I would sit on him open his mouth drop the pill aalll the way in the back of his throat close his mouth and massage his throat for a minute.  He will live.The alternative is to have a pissed off cat in a carrier for your two days drive.P.S. I tried to do  hours max  each day on my drive.  Motel  is really nice because they dont charge extra for animals and typically dont limit the number you can bring in.P.S.S. My cat overheats in the car your mileage may vary.  To make my cats life the most pleasant cloudy conditions a freezing car and even wiping him with a moist towel on a regular basis.P.S.S.S.  Ah yes Ive also heard something about giving your cat dried cooked chicken before the drive as it will make them less likely to pee.  It wasnt effective for me but hey at least the cats liked it.,savannah_cats,crrj3ka,1,t5_2sh36
