10669672,0,t3_5smn7o,Most of these cards are very weak. They need to be buffed,NerfRoyale,ddghuzq,3,t5_3iz5x
10670591,0,t1_ddgkidl,I honestly find it hard to believe the  damage and stun are bugs simply because absolutely any play testing wouldve discovered them.  That means if they are in fact bugs either Supercell does zero play testing or they released a card with multiple severe and game changing bugs.  That said the second two listed seem to be pretty plausible bugs to me.,NerfRoyale,ddgl9v6,2,t5_3iz5x
