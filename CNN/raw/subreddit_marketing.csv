Id be a dick too if I were working with tourists all day for  tips an hour.Youll need to identify the objectives first happier hospitality people isnt really the objective of the program. Happier tourists who spend more money and tell their networks to come spend more money sounds a bit closer so...yeah whats the ultimate objectivegoal research SMART goals? Next youll need to define how you will measure effectiveness and from there benchmarks and milestones. How many hospitality workers are you talking about? How many businesses?

96932,0,t1_cep72v3,I dont know that classic. What is it?And yes the info about Latvia might be true but does not matter right? Is joke. Somehow Latvia got that stereotype on reddit. But maybe talking about a composite picture  Latvia during WWII and right after it maybe? combined that with rural picture most Americans probably associate with Latvia plus the word latvia apart from it being a country and people but the word Latvia sounds humorous I think. Im sure you have those words in Russian. It does not sound like another word or phrase it just sounds funny by itself.Hey one thing I have always been curious about Russia. Russia was very very rural farming through Revolution. Sure sure there has always been an intelligensia. It was mostly the wealthy and many went to France for more elite education is my understanding. So then Lenin Stalin and the rest took over. How exactly did Russia gain the ability for manufacturing  tanks rifles etc. Furthermore how did Russia even get the ability to do anything with the atomic bomb?I mean sure I understand that there were many educated from the wealthy class. I get that. But that is not enough no way. One needs universities and a very large cadre of tenured professors. Where did the teachers even come from??? There were not enough teachers. Was education free? And the deal is that a lot of the majors were fucking HARD like physics and chemistry and mathematics and hard shit. Where does Russia find  physicists  chemists  mathematitions because a lot of those had to be working in industry too. And the part that I dont understand is the speed it happened from Russian revolution in  to WWII. USA got educated over a LONG period of time.I dont get that whole part of the absolute necessity of education and how it was acquired in Russia.

I would say the number one factor here would be a relevant keynote speaker.  It sounds tough but if you get personal and utilize connections to lock one up most other businesses want to be associated with industry progression.Aspiring Entrepreneurs like myself Id love to bring a connection of my own together and send a feeler out to other youngsters in the industry  it essentially becomes a recruiting CJ. Nonetheless you connect like minded people with similar goals.If you are in charge of organizing a conference with a specific objective for a given company e.g.  this is marketing to help link up potential clients then a keynote speaker who has experience making money doing what youre trying to do is the guy you go for and a lot of personal email communication will get them to do it.  Im relatively young but in my experience is an email to someone important with a description of my intentions a relation to their career and a detail of my aspirations almost always locks down a yes.EDIT Spell checking  lenovo is killing meEDIT I realized I didnt answer your question.

The correct answer is none. Because that would be a different view of how the universe works.Oh hi! Former Journalist and former Head of Content for a very large global entertainment brand here. One of my little jobs in my last role was to achieve high levels of visibility in one of the most competitve sectors in search. We achieved this and by achieved I mean dramitically reduced reliance on affiliates crushed outbound as a source of new customers and helped win the Times Tech Track  award as the UKs fastest growing technology company with high quality content. Yes we also used everything we knew about search to help those results but the absolute cornerstone to this programme was quality content. In terms of copy we spent about the same per word as any good quality magazine or newspaper and drew great writers along with an established publisher in as contributors. This not only fueled better rankings but more engagement sharing social media internal community activity and most importantly conversions.I could go on at length about how a good ranking is meaningless if the content is shit but Id suggest having a good look at the brands that are most successful at converting visibility to see what sort of value they place on quality content. ,marketing,cg851k2,4,t5_2qhmg

My advice is more on your overall website vs. your design skills.   remove the percentages on the skills.  Check the box on if you are proficient and talented with each application.  Anything less than  seems like playing up a perceived negative. Get a professional photo taken.  No need for a coat and tie but consider something more professional While your degree is highly important I would use the header to use a one line impact statement about you and the dent you want to make in the world.  This is prime real estate for you to stand out form the crowd  Omit frivolous capitalization in your job descriptions.  I want to hire designers that also dons guidance on punctuation spellingetc.   Social media I just sent you a LinkedIn invite.  While you are searching you should make your tweets and FB feed private.  If i scrolled through your tweets it would give me pause in shortlisting you for an interview.  Prospective employers will check this out. As for your work it is great given your place in your journey.  I would encourage you to take on as many interesting freelance projects to bolster your portfolio.Interview tips Wear a suit and tie even if the environment is casual.  You can always be overdressed but never be underdressed.  As you progress through the process with an employer hopefully they are cool and let you know that you dont need to be decked out on subsequent interviews.  I extend this courtesy to prospective hires Be picky and confident but not arrogant. Have fun and make the interview as much about learning about the company as the company learning about you.Good luck and have fun!,marketing,ci7tng9,2,t5_2qhmg

2074716,0,t3_2ikbu5,Its far from easy and yes you may have gotten lucky.  Having said that sometimes theres more to luck than meets the eye. My first venture into IM had me making over k per month after only  months.  I thought I must have gotten lucky. My next venture was making closer to k per month after about  months.  My third venture was an FX broker referral business where like your bitcoin trading referral business  I was getting a slice of every transaction.  My business focused on attracting serious professional day raders with accounts in the K range and after a year this business was generating over k per month with little effort. After  consecutive progressively more successful business in the IM space I was convinced I was an IM genius who could do no wrong.  Then after the FrankDodd bill passed the NFA enacted new regulations which effectively forced me to drop all US trading clients which was  of my business.  Essentially the business died overnight. For the next  years I had  consecutive failures and was pretty humbled by that.  It was a good lesson in humility for sure.  I learned a lot from the failures  maybe even more than from the successes. The point I want to make is not to expect everything to work  but thats OK  as long as you keep getting back on the horse.  And maybe more importantly is that when you are riding your success be sure to plan for the possibility it could fail by not risking all your money on the venture.  If it does fail youll want to have some funds to start the next venture. Fortunately my latest ventures are turning out to be quite successful again  but after the FX broker business failed it took longer than it should have to build up the new businesses simply because I hadnt saved enough funds for that rainy day. And because the new venture required more capital to start than previous businesses. ,marketing,cl3jif1,5,t5_2qhmg

2971345,0,t1_co2jwih,Sorry man thought I responded to this. For agency work as a copywriter you definitely need a solid book to get into one of the larger agencies. You can build a book of spec work for sure but they will always prefer copy written for actual clients and campaigns. Now if you want to get into content marketing a copywriting course will be helpful but its a different type of writing style. If content marketing andor inbound marketing is what you would like to break into then you are probably in luck. Its still new and growing and talent is still pretty new and inexperienced. You dont have the monolithic structures that support talent like agency creative has with copywriting programs copywriting boot camps etc. that enforce a certain level of boxchecking i.e. must have went to this type of program must have a book with at least x pieces in these specific industries etc.. With this rising form of marketing schools dont have programs because they cant keep up. When I started school they probably would have been talking about writing strategies for SEO. And that education would be outdated because Google said fuck you were smarter dont try to game our algorithm. Stuff changes fast here.  years ago the idea was to write a ton of small  word pieces to increase your indexed pages. Now its becoming apparent how important longform content is. If you spend a year or two in a program theres a chance that by time you leave it the stuff you learn wont be relevant any more and you will need to relearn.Are you a good writer? Then thats all you need. Think less about school and more about finding a gig. My biggest piece of advice. Go to inbound.org and check out their jobs section. A good mix of client and agency side there. Then go to www.hubspot.com and look at their agency partners. Click through to their websites and look for openings. If you find a couple of agencies you really like write a spec blog post. Look at their case studies page or their client page and write a spec piece for one of those clients. Submit it with your resume. Trust me...these agencies are starving for talent. Every industry conference I go to there are numerous sessions about how hard it is to find talent because the market is still fairly immature. Take advantage of the immature market and get yourself in front of them.,marketing,co5uvcr,2,t5_2qhmg

3102869,0,t1_cojlan0,gtHow does the cost increase in the long term?  I dont know all the specifics since I deal with the design more than the finances. But I can say that its frustrating to lose a nice feature because an agency quoted us a high number to code it when if some money was initially invested in employee training it might have been done inhouse for free. This is compounded by the fact that when something doesnt work exactly as it was mocked up we have to reach out again for it to be fixed because we are incapable of fixing it ourselves because we are so detached from our back end.gtWhat projects usually end up taking a long time for delivery?  Project delivery varies and thats because were not the only person reaching out to our agency for code work. Were one of their many customers and far from their most lucrative so we dont always get what we want when we want it. It doesnt always matter that its a small form change instead of coding a new plugin from scratch  they have to prioritize their work load and that means we have to wait sometimes.gtCan you give me an example so that I can understand why you mentioned less control over branding and appearance late to adopt new trends and web standards?  Its just adding another step in an already long process made worse by the fact that the middleman is someone who doesnt exactly know our brand and wasnt in the brainstorming meetings. You can try to be as specific as you can with functionality and design but things can get lost in translation from time to time which means spending resources to go back and fix the mistakes.Additionally because money is allocated for an agency to make these changes thats less money to be allocated to redesigning the site more often. Were also pigeonholed into designing around one specific agencys work methods because we have a last relationship and they know our systems better than anyone else because they designed them. If we want to make a site better optimized for HTML and responsive design we cant go train our employees or hire someone who has experience in that area we have to hope to hell that the agency knows how to do it for cheap enough that we dont have to scrap the idea entirely and design our page like its .All that said there are absolutely times where outsourcing is a great idea and a more efficient use of resources. Maintaining a huge corporate website with weekly if not daily backend changes is probably not one of them.,marketing,cojm0gv,1,t5_2qhmg

We have built custom forms and dashboards that essentially use it as a framework. It is has been very versatile and if you have a developer can link into just about anything to it. Just about everything in it can be accessed through databases or you can use it as is and use the interface which can also be highly customized. If you can imagine how you want the system to run you can build it to run that way.

Exclusivity making it seem as an exclusive item. Apple has been a master at creating a culture of exclusivity. There is a reason that the term Apple Snob exists. . Quality  Regardless of the hype Apple builds incredibly intuitive and high quality products most at least. No marketing strategy in the world can sustain a product long term if it is a shit product.

5032021,0,t3_3juiux,Im not going to read your link but I am going to tell you that I was a tech journalist for a while and tell you some advice from my perspective. Journalism is a job. Its fun its challenging but its a job. And I am a person doing that job. My advice? Make my job easy. Theres a  chance I dont understand how cool and innovative your technology is. If I really understood technology and how it works then I would go work for a startup and try to get rich. What I do care about is making my editors happy and getting some pageviews on my story and not having to chase people down and do a lot of leg work to do it. Here are some steps to getting coverage from me at least Dont send me a press release in the body of an email.  Send me a personal notea short onedescribing a recent trend and how your product fits into it. It helps to indicate that youre actually familiar with my coverage. I read your story about X wonder if you might be interested in hearing our angle on the same problem. Tell me youve got someone lined up for an interview and that its not a marketing or communications person. Engineers and executives are preferred. Its okay to offer a date and timeId be glad to connect later this week. Perhaps Thursday afternoon at ? Understand that a good news story will not be about a product release. It will be about a problem or trend. So its unlikely Ill give you a dedicated article. But I might want to include details about your product in a larger piece that also includes interviews and information from your competitors. Dont call out your competitors but do tell me what makes your product unique and do offer meaningful specific perspective. Anyway. Hope this is helpful.,marketing,cusjt1j,5,t5_2qhmg
5068465,0,t1_cuwx3em,It is amazing how many people in marketing have no clue how to useunderstand Google Analytics...I highly recommend you take this advice. In a nutshell Analytics is used to measure and understand website traffic  how many people visit your site where they come from what pages they visit etc. You can find this and similar courses from Google here AdWords is another great place to focus your efforts. This is creating and managing all the ads you see in Google search results top sidebar as well as some specialized ads for display mobile etc. Again adding this to your utility belt makes you a very valuable commodity especially when combined with Analytics knowlege. You can learn more about certification here As ujb said there are also plenty of other software platforms you can learn including CRM Marketing Automation Social Media Ad platforms specifically Facebook amp Linkedin for most biz ads SEO tools etc. Knowing the tools is a great way to get your foot in the door. Youll find a lot of inhouse teams and agencies will be willing to take a risk on you since you can jump right in with execution. ,marketing,cuwxwhb,4,t5_2qhmg

5213360,0,t3_3md1x1,You cant make an image go viral. You have to start with a viral image. This means a few iterations and testing. You also have to have some kind of a network to seed the image. On top of it all a great deal of luck is still involved.  The key is having an image that people will want to share once its been seeded. The timeliness of the piece is a big part of that. Having the right piece at the right time. The other factor is it needs to be picked up by the media and then for other media sites to spread the image.  Most importantly this is more of a talent than it is a skill. If you have to ask how to make something go viral the answer is you dont.  As far as a collection of best ideas it just doesnt work that way. The right piece at the right time making use of the right cognitive biases hitting the right emotions having an established network and outright luck.  There isnt a workable formula because as mentioned the explanation is always going to be hindsight bias.  However having an understanding of what drives people to share is absolutely helpful. Still luck timing and having a network in place to seed.  Ive had a lot of people present me with something and ask me to make it go viral and my response is always it doesnt work that way. The piece has to be engineered from the start and the concept underlying the piece tested.,marketing,cveeipw,1,t5_2qhmg

5409482,0,t3_3p3ddq,My advice is going to be pretty general based on what youve given us as far as goal and scope.   Well digital marketing today involves less of an online shop and more of an online amusement park. The idea is less about having a website that sells products and instead offers a site full of engaging content with a gift shop at the end.    Your own sites and social media campaigns should be funneling consumers.    Etsy does a sort of good job by providing an interface thats akin to social media sites. But unless your brand is home made etsy products etsy doesnt help your brand.    You need a better following to sell the products because by branding consumers they sell the products for you. Your blog should already be branding the followers as TEAmmembers of team tea. Same with the social media page. Getting them to create content and share it with you and eachother helps accomplish this.     Im not entirely sure what you were looking for but I hope it helps.,marketing,cw34dpy,4,t5_2qhmg

Our club gets our funding mostly from companies like that. In trade for their funding we give a party every now and so often and we hang their banners. Or put their logo on the flyers we hand out.

To say  off means they still made   probably  of that is profit still drink markups are extremely high so theyve lost nothing but think theyve gained both in profits and in free marketing selfies.In reality theyll lose the cost of their marketing efforts and potentially gain the stigma of cheap bastards from the locals.A great book to read about the science behind free vs discounted is Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely. Its a great marketing book and an even better commerce book. Behavior psychology  why we do the things we do.Perhaps a few examples from this book will help your case with the owners and save you a headache or two.

6412238,0,t1_cziejmc,Thanks for the reply. I definitely agree with the fact that there are certain companies that may not have the most techsavvy internet base. . The ability to channel how you communicate This is a big one and even though an online community would help steer the company I still think there is a problem in the fact that it changes for each brand. So if X company has a community page and they very proactively direct all conversations there then maybe I use it as a communication channel. However right when I have a question or ideas for brand Z and Im back to ground zero I will probably revert back to old habits of using Twitter or something. Does the lack of standardization affect everyone disable us from creating a conditional behavior for users?. Direct Communication Communities can be a great way to direct conversations in this sense as currently when a user goes to write an email they have no other examples of emailsquestionsideas that people have written before. If a community shows off the previous way brands and users have interacted before you write your note it would direct conversations in a much better light. Also if a user writes a lackluster questionidea the brand usually has to suck it up but a community could enable other users to give them a friendly lovetap i.e Hey you never uploaded any screenshots for them to see theyre not going to be able to help you without those. Knowledge Base I think this is one of the main benefits of a community and it amazes me that people have only just started to utilize a knowledge base. Many teams barely even use an FAQ page but it makes  sense for brands to answer the same question multiple times within reclusive channels. ARCHIVE ALL THE THINGSThe balance between customer support and marketing is an interesting one... and one that could be a big problem as some teams look at a community in a support based light others see the proactive marketingfeedback value. Things that exist in the gray area between departments often always get lost in the ethos so this is a big one to define.PS  Do you think it benefits socialcontent marketers in the fact that their tools are all the same and everyone starts at  i.e. everyone uses the same Twitter FB Medium etc  If everyone creates their own online community that looksfunctions in a different manor I dont think there will ever be an industry dedicated to pushing the category forward.

Having them think through their content is sometimes a struggle What message are you trying to convey? Who is your reader and what information do they care about?

9477201,0,t3_5ak7bk,IMO Ive come to the conclusion spending more than  minutes on this is a waste of time. Pen and paper is a great alternative  the Google KW planner is very good too  and free.Do Adwords first let that guide SEO keywords.For PPC just focus on  dead on keywords at first.  Put them in their own ad groups w unique copy.  Use dedicated landing pages for each ad group.At this point it doesnt hurt to do alittle competitive intel which you can do for free using Google.  Make sure your conversion pixel is set up or your tracking via Google Analytics goal import.Run a campaign for  days.Make tweaks  optimizations.If you work hard and this is a small campaign spending k or less per month at about  days you should have a clear idea of what keywords and ads work and what the ROI is.  Even with long sales cycle lead gen you can have an idea of ROI with basic math and realistic expectations.These are the pages you try and rank for SEO.  Remember Spyfu will show you interesting data but what competitors appear to have success with is far different that what you may do at the onset. ,marketing,d9h9pg2,2,t5_2qhmg

The question was about untapped social media channels not anything latinamericarelated.And by the way niche means specialized segment of the market. It shouldnt be used in the sense you are using. You are using it as synonym of small when thats not the meaning of it. Just because its not used in latin america doesnt make it niche because small  niche. Niche usually means its very specialized and could be used only for several smaller markets  only on few segments of people which isnt the case for bored panda instagram or pinterest.

10018587,0,t1_dbdfw2c,very good question! first there is no point in doing fake followers as long as you do it to promote your first tier accounts. so for example if you want to push some brand new account you may follow it using your others accounts in the same niche. other than that there is no point in doing fake followers. also brands and companies are interested in engagement of posts anyway so....you dont have sharing and retweets in instagram for sure but you do have Likes. you also have hashtags  people use instagram search even thought thats not the best way to do it. a new account may gain tons of followers overnight if the person behind it knows what he is doing. there are many ways to gain followers but the fastest way is simple posting pics on your others accounts with a link to your brand new account  its that simple but effective. also if you have lots of contacts from others instagram marketers you can do reciprocal promotions  more of this later,marketing,dbdg7ss,-3,t5_2qhmg

10032149,0,t3_5jch45,I would say absolutely. Video content is everywhere from snapchat to instagram to facebook and obviously youtube.  The fact that instagram has changed their video length to up to a minute of however long is is is very indicative of how much video content is used.  It tell me that video is important enough that a picture sharing service or at least what started off as one is putting in enough resources to host larger and larger video content. I would also keep an eye on live content.  there seems to be a push on all social media to support live broadcast. I think pictures are still in the forefront but video is so easy to access now and create as well that its only a matter of time.  Video also creates a dynamic experience that rolls the viewer along in a directed path. Invaluable to marketers and content creators. Just my two cents. Cheers!,marketing,dbf7rzl,3,t5_2qhmg

Facebook ads will have a varying degree of success depending on what sort of data you have already. You will be starting really high in the funnel with just interestbehavior targeting so be prepared to build out a strategy for each step of the funnel. Once you gather enough data from the initial campaign or if you already have that data available you will really start to see some results. Boosted posts are great for keeping you in the minds of people who are already your fans as a branding play but no so much from a  conversion standpoint.

Needs a lot more thought through than just dumping emails to FB and telling it to do LLA from it. Increases your reach and conversion rate for a very low cost. Im doing about . CPM on few of my products in USA. Such numbers are impossible if you try via regular targeting. LLA is FB Ads on steroids. The amount of visitors youve will give a huge sample size and drive your costs down further while retaining a decent conversion As for emails I follow a sequence of  EMails based on which part of the funnel theyre in and how much I value their LTV. Starts from a freebie land to page email to upsellcrossell and reactivation to name a few each unique based on the content and its intent.,marketing,dea25vf,1,t5_2qhmg
10966425,0,t3_5wi6xh,Hey Start reading information on customer journey mapping and understanding your buyer groups... As you would know in BB purchases generally arent down to one person but rather a few economic buyers op buyers technical buyers etc...When you understand this and start mapping out their purchasing journey you can begin to determine what content you should be building to bolster your sales pipeline... For example you need to drive more leads? Why not get your tech experts to start writing a whitepaper in which you can distribute? ,marketing,deb3y7o,1,t5_2qhmg
10974392,0,t1_debwjkn,the headliner himself did not sell out the concert. maybe today he would but not in .ive booked over  college shows and its actually pretty common for the artists to not promote the show at all. as in most wont even tweet about the performance until its over.this is in part because artists dont get a cool rep by playing the college circuit. its also in part because their booking agents can easily squeeze more cash out of venues by itemizing everything from first class tickets vs coach to tweets facebook posts etc.a few other things working against us no drinking allowed at the venue not a particularly cool venue for a show it was our school gym there was no other artist and tickets were minimum . this is kinda pricy. usually were convinced to see a band if another  bands we know are also performing. FWIW i paid  to see Panic! At the Disco Weezer AND Jacks Mannequin just a few months ago.i think the post does a decent job at showing how  turned into ticket sales indeed.we had thousands of votes lots of contestants sharing the show incessantly to their fans and then of course a  day turnaround.shows for huge artists today dont necessarily sell out in  days. and even ifwhen they do theres still a ton of marketing surrounding that success.IMO folks who think popular artist  sold out show are the same who believe in build it and they will come. and there are many other blog posts that will debunk the latter concept.i appreciate the candid feedback but respectfully disagree. of course trey songz contributed to some of the ticket sales. of course our contest did too.cheers.,marketing,debygc5,-17,t5_2qhmg

11010600,0,t1_defbq0t,I dont know who said this but back in the day people were flooded with direct mail and got really excited when they received an email.Now its usually the other way around email inboxes are flooded but if you received a letter you are really curious to see what it is about.The problem with Direct Mail is the cost scale and difficulty to track and improve. Direct mail was one of the first things I did its very cumbersome costly and its very difficult to know if its working how much its actually working and what you can do to improve it.At the same time email is getting more difficult. Inboxes are exploding spam filters and inbox filters. I dont think Direct Mail is dead. Its just that now it is competing against email sms facebook etc.,marketing,deg0rei,1,t5_2qhmg

11080450,0,t1_dengf4d,If you are wanting to get into highend luxury products its probably easier now than at any time in history.  Etsy is a good example of how easy it is to create a niche product and find an audience.  However with a few exceptions you wont find really highend products on Etsy.  A good example of how a new luxury brand operates would be something like Best Made Company     They have a specific audience they are targeting  ss high income men that have an interest in outdoor equipment and asthetics.   They have a focused selection of products  Camping gear outdoor clothing and a few lifestyle accessories that complement their other products. Their audience and product categories arent unique they are going after the same audience that everyone else in the outdoor gear market is North Face Patagonia Academy Coleman Gerber etc....  What really sets Best Made Company apart from these other companies is the lack of selection.  All of these other companies carry thousands of items with dozens of brands price points and features so that no matter who you are you should be able to find something for you.    Best Made Company goes the opposite route and finds a small selection of products in each category and only sells those that they feel meet the standards of their brand. So their message to consumers is pretty simple  Sure you can purchase a canvas duffel bag from the army surplus store for cheap but if you want a duffel bag thats so tough your grand kids will still be using it youll buy it from us. So if you want to break into the luxury market start off by creating a product that is hands down the better than anything else in the market in at least  way and then market the hell out of that.  If you cant create something thats better than everyone else keep looking.   Actually now that I am almost done with my post I am remembering another product that is probably closer to what you are wanting to do.  Its also in the outdoor gear category which is hilarious because I am not an outdoor type of person.  This was a successful kickstarter for a single product that a small team of people prototyped and were eventually able to manufacture.  Watch the video though its really really good at conveying the type of message that you want with a luxury brand its as much about function as it is about lifestyle.  All of the overt messaging is about the functionality of the belt but everything else about the video is about lifestyle look at dresser he uses the truck he drives etc....Anyway this was fun but Ive got to get back to work.  Message me if you ever want to talk about marketing I can talk about this stuff all day. ,marketing,denyjc2,2,t5_2qhmg

11157909,0,t3_5z9q7o,I think you should first try to analyze why your marketing efforts are not bringing new customers. Either you focus on the wrong target groupe it does not make any sense if you get  more impressions from people who will never buy or your leads are not qualified enough. Its always tough to define what a lead is. If you dont bring any new leads its useless to impress with your traffic increase in my opinion. But this depends of course on eh strategy. If you focus a content strategy and all of your leads are currently in the awareness or decision making stage it hopefully brings some ROI in future. ,marketing,dewqjn9,1,t5_2qhmg

Not only in that I narrow my focus more but I have a much deeper access to analytics and personnel. At an agency I often killed myself working on reports that I am not sure were even read. It feels more honest. I manipulate the numbers less because I am working less on keeping the client happy. ,marketing,dgod7d6,1,t5_2qhmg
