2638735,0,t3_2pqokr,The short Star Trek Into Reference video they did and their eventual Into Darkness HitB.  They kept listing elements from Into Darkness on and on that were direct references to wellknown things from Star Trek and it just made me go.... Yes? And?  They never made any kind of point in the video and it was like the meaning of the list was supposed to be selfevident.  References to existing material in a movie dont always exist as nothing more than a cheap ploy especially when as I feel Into Darkness was that movie is ABOUT the existing material with intentionallynoticeable plot similarites as an element of the story.    In the HitB episode they also put a huge focus on debatable plotholes.  Why didnt they matter in Dark Knight Rises but they do here?  I remember them saying something about fans being wrong for obsessing over the TDKR plotholes because the focus was on the character arcs in that movie and not the continuing story.  It doesnt matter how bruce wayne got back to gotham because the point is BATMANS BACK.  And yet the focus of Into Darkness was definitely on Kirks arrogance screwing up things he cares about and being humbled by that and reprioritizing everything to solve a problem.  Im no big fan of Into Darkness but I just felt they treated it unfairly.,RedLetterMedia,cn30k08,1,t5_2tuot

2648507,0,t1_cn2xtvw,The Fellowship is just pure genius in terms of film making. Theres just scene after scene of brilliance. A good example is the scene where the Hobbits fall off the cliff and find the mushrooms.It starts with reintroducing Merry and Pippin in the amusing and charming chase scene where they escape farmer maggot and land on the road. In a few seconds of film its reinforced the characters of Merry and Pipping cheeky loveable Hobbits. You instantly like and care about them. Then the tension starts to build. You can feel the tension of Frodo as he senses something wrong. The contrast between the panic in his voice and the other Hobbits just fucking around in the background ramps up the tension. They hide in the hollow under the tree. The Black rider comes in to shot framed by a low camera angle than then rolls in even lower. It makes the rider above look far bigger and threatening whilst emphasing the vulnerability of the hobbits. The horse is real and looks fucked up. The rider dismounts the sound gives so much weight to the ringwraith. This isnt pixels on the screen this thing is fucking real. This dark freaky fucking thing looms over the hobbits shown from an even lower camera angle. And it starts fucking sniffing. A big spider crawls out over Frodos shoulder a big centipede is drawn out its hole. I mean how fucking genius is this theyre anchoring peoples feeling of unease and phobia of creepy crawlies to interaction with the Nazgul. Its such a perfect scene and its so much more powerful than anything they manage with the Nazgul in the Hobbit. ,RedLetterMedia,cn4ai7l,4,t5_2tuot

Theres another HitB I think the Star Trek Into Darkness one but Im not totally sure where they point out that everybody in the movie is an idiot and that Starfleet might as well not even have a chain of command or rules because nobody ever follows them and theres basically no punishment ever. Thats totally applicable here too. The plot only moves forward at times because of how dumb the characters are and I had no fucking clue what anybodys job at InGen was. Like what the hell is Claires job? Marketing and finance but also park security and day to day operations? Who is Hoskins who does he work for and what is his job? He seems to work for InGen rather than the park but the park is owned by InGen but Hoskins runs their private military that isnt located on the island? And he can boss Claire around but Owen can punch him in the face and blatantly disregard his orders with essentially no punishment whatsoever? What does Owen do? Velociraptor training and enclosure consultancy? Muldoon made sense in Jurassic Park because he was a game warden who had worked with dangerous animals in Africa but Owen was just a Navy serviceman.

The full corpus of MSG combines camp with some serious commentary on big issues but MSGV by itself is probably the weakest manifestation of Kojimas style. Its juvenile to western audiences in the way a lot of acclaimed anime is juvenile and chalking it up to failed director writing is dismissive and ignorant. It would be like criticizing Bollywood for just being purile high school musicals when thats what the audience wants. Anyway Im surprised at the weary recommendation when the gameplay is so solid considering how much they love streaming Mario. Maybe they found the story so bad that it actively discouraged further play but preferring Mario over MSGV in terms of gameplay is basically stockholm syndrome nostalgia. MSGV will be the seminal open world stealth game for years to come ANYONE who enjoys stealth and can stomach past the prologue will get  hours of solid gameplaykidnappingeugenics out of it before repetition sets in.,RedLetterMedia,cvg1g4a,-6,t5_2tuot

Also that DLC that added punching so you didnt have to use equipment to subdue everyone.  If youre into the breach and clear genera I highly completely Absolutely recommend Rainbow six Siege. Its multiplayer only Im pretty sure but the whole slow paced combat and destructible environments its amazing. If you get some friends it can turn into a real strategic game.  If you need single player versions earlier rainbow six games have various police swat and military operations full of planning and intel that play very similarly. I recommend researching them tho Rainbow  Vegas lacks the preplanning methods and some of the really early games have a tendency to be extremely hard to understand.

8242361,0,t1_d57lemb,Oof that second clip you linked was definitely a little weird. So they make fun of Spike Lee for complaining about the absence of black characters in Flags of Our Fathers which is sort of fair. His Clint Eastwood comments were very misguided. But he actually did have an important point to make even if he didnt express it particularly well. The experience of blacks in WWII has been horribly underrepresented people of color were fighting and dying for democracy when they didnt have a voice back home. I think he was trying to speak to this subject and cinema in general and he made the mistake of just latching onto the most recent American WWII movie to make a point and not really thinking it through. I think this agitates people more than it should.But what really bothers me about that clip is when they try to refute Lees point in that interview by listing a bunch of movies that can vaguely be classified as black issue movies. Lee was referring to WWII movies specifically so that was fucking dumb on their part. This is not an area that RLM seem to have a particularly sophisticated grasp on.I know most of you will call me a Sensitive Joss Whedon for going on like this but come on theres nothing wrong with calling RLM out on their bullshit every now and then.

The humor made sense as it was a space adventure. TFA was a grim story about defection abandonment and deception. Poe was on a mission Rey and Finn were running for their lives and just decided to take BB to the Rebels for some reason. The humor didnt really work because its not really a space adventure but more of a space escape. It was also  and trying to force millennial humor into a retro s scifi movie just didnt work.

I dont know what Plinkett could possibly say that hasnt already been covered.But if all Ill likely get is Plinkett sitting in his chair occasionally getting up to walk three feet over to sit in his computer chair Id rather have no review at all.  Half of the appeal of Plinkett for me is the elaborate sidestories within the reviews and the splicedin clips of other footage that is completely out of context.  The kind of stuff that gives brief disturbing glimpses into Plinketts mind.  Like hes seen so many movies that his brain has become akin to a VHS tape that has been recorded over and over hundreds of times.  I really missed that in the TFA review.It used to be Plinkett was a psychotic murderer who happened to review movies.  Now his fame has reversed those aspects of his character.

9954047,0,t1_db4sbf2,Ok I think I might as well give my opinion on the films. TPM of course is the one most people hate I think it actually comes down to poor writing and scripting for why its bad. Even if you took away Jar Jar Binks out of the equation it would still have it flaws. The only good parts of the film were the pod racing and the lightsaber battling with Darth Maul thats pretty much it sadly.AotC I think this one actually feels cheesy compared to TPM the lightsaber fighting isnt as good as TPM although the film does have more variety in action scenes. I think the romance scenes could have been handled better they made it very dull and it goes on for too long I dont mind long romance scenes but if you make it this dull then people are going to go sleep.RotS definitely the best film in this trilogy sure it has its own flaws such as Vaders Noooo which could have been handled better but thinking about this film now I think the good actually outweigh the bad. The lightsaber fights are all cool but out of all of them Yoda vs. Palpatine was the big cherry on the top.Overall I just wished TPM and AotC were better than they are while RotS could have been fine tuned a bit more.So my final scoresTPM  AotC  RotS  ,RedLetterMedia,db51cx5,1,t5_2tuot

10038561,0,t1_dbf7a8w,gtWhat gap? Did this story need to be told.Well technically no story needs to be told. Its a movie they dont do movies out of necessity. They do them because theyre entertaining and it makes money. But there is about a  year gap between Episode  and Rogue One and its always been full of a lot of questions. This story sets the stage for Episode  in a way which previously was only based on exposition.gtDescribe all of them without mentioning their occupation or role in the plan.Theres Jyn whos the typical Star Wars stereotype of the orphan who becomes inspired by a cause and rises up to fight against oppression which has been done countless times except this time the character has a catalyst for this transformation. Her love for her father drives her to fight not just to end the oppression but to clear her fathers name. She has spent years hiding her feelings on this issue because shes grown up around men who believed her father was the enemy.Then theres Cassian whos grown up in a world full of espionage. He literally lives his life on lies and has never known peace. Although he truly believes hes fighting for the right side he also feels like hes sacrificed a lot of himself for the cause. The mission to steal the Death Star plans was a way for him to feel like a real soldier again not just a spy. To step out of the shadows and into the history books.Theres Rook the Imperial cargo pilot. He seems deeply troubled by either things hes done in the past for the Empire or by his knowledge of the Death Stars capability. Perhaps both. Providing the rebels with the message from Galen was a moral imperative for him. Choosing to fight along side the rebels was a choice which he seems to hope will redeem his soul.Theres Galen Erso who chose to leave a long and fruitful career as an Imperial officer due to his morals being in conflict with the cause. He soils his soul by rejoining the Empire which ruined his family and intends to murder billions just for the slight chance of laying a trap in their plans. His daughter becomes his only hope for success she must carry on his mission. Sort of a passing of the torch.Theres KSO who is just there for comedic relief... I could go into his motivations and transformation but hes a droid and any motivations we might seem to pick up on can easily be explained as programming.gtNot necessary in the Star Wars universe. Theyre supposed to be fun adventures. This took itself way too seriously.The Empire Strikes Back had a very dark tone throughout. Even Return of the Jedi had a dark tone at the end. Hell even Episode  showed the series protagonist deciding to kill children then being burned alive. The franchise is adventurous but its also sad and frightening at times too. Its like the old Indiana Jones films where Indie spends his time being dashing and clever then we get to see someones face melt.gtVader on Mustafar was not necessary. RD and CPO were not necessary. Tarkin was not necessary. The AT AT walkers made no sense on a goddamn jungle planet that is mostly water.Vader was necessary but having his base be on Mustafar may not have been. Yet do they even admit its Mustafar? I mean its a volcano planet sure. But theres probably a ton of those.RD and CPO were not absolutely necessary but we know they had to be on Princess Leias ship by the end of the last scene so having them make an appearance wasnt totally out of left field.Tarkins appearance actually was necessary. The whole movie surrounds the Death Stars military director trying to fix the flaws in his operation but we know that by the beginning of Episode  its Tarkin who is in charge of the Death Star. His appearance on the scene wouldnt make sense without some changing of the guard occurring in Rogue One showing Tarkin taking over.The ATAT walkers werent exactly necessary but if the film didnt show them on scene then it would just need some other cool futuristic war machine. Then people would just complain that the new war machine was just a way for Disney to sell new toys. Also you cant really complain that the terrain made the ATAT an illogical choice because the ATAT design is inherently illogical. Its slow moving extremely heavy and has only two large blaster cannons for weapons. Its actually less effective on the battlefield than a normal tank. You cant trip a tank!,RedLetterMedia,dbg1u8i,1,t5_2tuot

10094279,0,t1_dbn7yy9,I loved everything you said.  I actually think TFA did a pretty good job of setting up Rey as a badass that didnt need help. She was abandoned on a remote planet and basically had to fend for herself for years. She spent over a decade scavenging the inside of downed ships so it makes sense that she knows these vessels inside and out. The only thing that doesnt sit right with me is her connection to the Force. But Im hoping the sequels will explain that. Edit Man Im going to come off as some Force Awakens fanboy but I SWEAR its like my th favorite Star Wars film. Kylo was shot by Chewies bowcaster. A weapon the movie sets up multiple times as being able to knock a man  feet in the air killing them instantly.

10094927,0,t1_dbnalus,To your first point. The garbage chute scene right after and jail break scene right before have plenty of tension. The hallway scene is actually there to relieve tension as we get to know our characters better. You actually see this a lot in ANH.  The bridge swinging scene for example. Luke and Leia have zero cover yet the storm troopers somehow miss at every opportunity. Its a trope for gods sake. Its stupid and CAN take you out of a the movie but we give it a pass only because the characters are great. gt Rogue One succeeded in making Stormtroopers and the Empire feel like a mortal threat. We can see Rogue Ones characters fear for the lives weigh their chances of success and then commit to a plan that will probably fail out of necessity. The empire may feel more menacing but it doesnt mean shit when I dont care anything for the characters when they die. Which is were the movie absolutely fails for me.

10107979,0,t1_dbofovd,gt Some quality editing is able to save much of the sequelsWell lets seegtOpening of the movie following title sequence picks up immediately after The Animatrix The Last Transmission of the Osiris ends using live action scenes from the Enter the Matrix video game. All added scene from Enter the Matrix have been upconverted to p color corrected sharpened and had a custom . surround sound mix added.Im not sure editing in those animated sequences does much to salvage a movie that isnt really missing that spinoff backstory in the first place.gtNeos dream of Trinity dying has been removedgtThe tower to the source sequence has been dramatically changed no Smith no Trinity entering The Matrix no bomb no rooftop save The opening sequence and the subsequent rescue are the emotional core of the movie and among the best parts in it.gtRemoved scenes of Morpheus Link Neo and Trinity on the Neb at the beginning of the filmMakes sense those are pretty dull and disposable too.gt Neo no longer visits the home of The OracleAgain one of the finest moments.gt Agent Smiths first meeting with Neo has been shortened slightly for pacingThere are no pacing issues with the Smith meeting.gtThe Merovingian doesnt tout the virtues of the FrenchAnother best moment.gt Much of The Merovingians speech has been reduced for pacingOnce again no pacing issues.gt Bane has been completely removedCertainly not a highlight either.Im sorry  all for interestingcreative reedits etc. but dont just be cutting out the best parts of the movie and then proclaim how youve salvaged it.,RedLetterMedia,dbp2x44,0,t5_2tuot

If theres anything you can criticize TFA for its not the characters.ampgtThey came off to me as quite contrived indeed and at least we established in the prequels that Anakin was trained rather than just picking up a lightsaber and overpowering a trained Sith apprentice. Youre talking about plot contrivances not really character development. Rey not being properly trained to swing a sword around is irrelevant to her character.They guy youre responding tos point was that Anakin is just there to be a Jedi swing his lightsaber around and have plot things happen around him. Rey is a fleshed out and real character. There could be some debate about that I guess but she definitely is at least in comparison to anyone in the prequels.,RedLetterMedia,dbzzhxv,7,t5_2tuot

These men and women are supposedly at the top of not only their game but the game if paycheck ie industry valuation is anything to go by. Surely these trained experienced and passionate individuals care enough to do a little better?Its for that reason that my favourite screenwriter will probably always be William Goldman. The story goes that he wrote the screenplay for Maverick in one draft. By no means is it an excellent film  its probably only just a good film  but that film has better dialogue in one scene than Sony Pictures has managed in their last five years.Goldman was a professional who knew how to work and how to bring something of value to the table even on less amazing projects.

Hell or High Water did an excellent job capturing the feeling and disappointment in the flyover states and I think it is an important movie is showing some of the attitudes that led to Trumps victory. Moonlight was great for showing the life of a gay black man which is a minority that is usually ignored or worse treated as if the issues facing gay black men are the same as issues facing gay white men. I would be frustrated to see La La Land win over two movies that I think are more relevant to the culture of .I should also clarify that I dont think that should be the case every year but I think this year when you have a lot of confusion uncertainty and animosity and have two movies like that which are also exceptional in every way and much better than La La Land it would be a shame to give it to La La Land so that Hollywood came perform autofellatio.EDIT I also should have added Arrival to the list of important films from this year not only because it is relevant but also because in my mind it perfectly showed what science fiction can do and was a welcome break from the more action oriented scifi of the last few years.

At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me.

11589461,0,t1_dg9czxv,I agree that both are great films but the difference is one is great at being a good movie while the other is an example of perfection in every regard of filmmaking. I dont think anyone would say that Star Wars is a rich innovative story or that its editing broke new ground but its great despite that because it tells the story it needs to tell to be an inspiring fun series of films. But the Godfather series isnt quite the same. The structure of the narrative alone was a genius fresh take on the three act norm. The editing of the wedding scene set the standard for the next decade of filmmaking it was unprecedented. And all these masterful pieces came together to put on display one of the greatest character transformations in all of cinema history. None of this is to diminish the importance of Star Wars either it set its own standards. Without even talking about its visual effects innovations its scale changed the scope for the next decade of films as well everyone wanted their adventureaction films to be a as grandiose as Star Wars. But you cant say that Star Wars was genius filmmakingstorytelling. Effective filmmakingstorytelling in service of a greater whole sure but not trendsetting.And none of this has anything to do with how much we like the movies. I like watching Star Wars much more than watching Citizen Kane but theyre not even comparable when talking about technique.

11616130,0,t1_dgcoliu,I agree with you about the characters and I dont think Rogue One is particularly dark in the grand scheme of things and it being dark wasnt why I liked it. I guess the film felt more like a war movie than any of the other Star Wars films and that to me made it feel more realistic and darker. And compared to the OG trilogy there wasnt too much funny dialogue or fun space adventure moments so the film felt dark the whole way through whereas the OG trilogy has equally dark moments as Rogue One but theyre balanced out with the fun dialogue and action. ROTS doesnt have this either but the film has so many other issues that it does just feel like Lucas attempting to be dark instead of the film actually feeling like a dark and serious movie. Rogue One at least felt like it at times. And also Superman technically doesnt die in BvS. Hes buried but the dirt on the coffin rises symbolizing that he doesnt die Sadly. And none of the main characters in Suicide Squad die either. ,RedLetterMedia,dgcp5qs,0,t5_2tuot

11620362,0,t1_dgcedaq,gtHe calls them Original Trilogy Fanboys. there is a certain type of fanboy so far down the hole of fanboy that he cannot understand criticism as something other than being another kind of fanboy. this isnt new. that  page rebuttal to the plinkett phantom menace review took the same argument.its a pretty common thing among people who are very invested in something even outside of pop culture. not to get political but notice how frequently some religious people characterize ideas they dislike as just another religion or how people very inclined to a political ideology cant see criticism of that ideology as anything other than support for the other ideology.,RedLetterMedia,dgd6g8d,9,t5_2tuot

Im a free market guy and I feel like RLM is doing what people in a free market should be doing actively critiquing the worst dreck so that likeminded people can avoid it and letting the cream rise to the top. Hence why the Best of the Worst sometimes finds some hidden gems and other times finds the Osteoporosis Dance. But were going to see what we want to swe and I dont discount it as a valid interpretation of RLMs work. ,RedLetterMedia,dgipnlg,14,t5_2tuot
11676956,0,t1_dgje483,The problem with the lion turtle is that at least I vaguely remember hearing this is that the lion turtles and the story of the first avatar were supposed to be in ATLA originally. The idea was scrapped an so the background of the history of bending was shown in the Legend of Korra instead.Personally I think the whole killing is wrong and theres always another option is kind of a tired internal conflict but it does make sense from Aangs point of view. At the same time I feel like a Man of Steelesque neck snap would be equally bad. It is a copout but it was an inevitability with the ending.,RedLetterMedia,dgjll8p,1,t5_2tuot
