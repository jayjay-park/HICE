2548009,0,t3_2owdpx,The sample pack for Gremlin Favorites is one flavor for each of the people who vape back here.  Not sure if Josh has changed his mind on the VMT but each of those is a pretty good vape.,gremlinjuice,cmr5u1i,2,t5_2x0aj
3231897,0,t1_cow3y5n,Damn yours would be one of the  orders shipped out on the th that still havent updated since hitting kent.  We have been keeping an eye on them and have used those tracking numbers to show the Post Office that something is seriously wrong and needs to be fixed ASAP.  Unfortunately that didnt even shake your order so well be sending out replacements today.  Hopefully at least one order gets to you quickly!,gremlinjuice,cowzpl2,2,t5_2x0aj

7526316,0,t3_4i5f5r,So on the age verify popupoverlay when you first visit the site and the multiple times it pops up again while navigating around the site it seems to deploy an annoying ad at the bottom of the screen that is somehow bypassing my adblock lists. A minor annoyance but not a big deal. But I find odd is that the ads are for other juice companies like Roobix Elite Elixir and Lost Coast Liquid LLC. Just seems weird to see popup ads from competitor businesses. Im sure yall are well aware of this but I just thought I would mention it on the off chance that is not the case.,gremlinjuice,d2xpdy1,1,t5_2x0aj
