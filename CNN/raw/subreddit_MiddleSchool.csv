4244022,0,t1_cs3ueuh,I think I found out what is causing this. Right now Im on summer break. On the last day of school I decided to just tell her that I liked her I know worst time to tell her but I didnt.  beacause I was really nervous  because it was a bad time. I now regret that descision. Good news is she lives in my area! Bad news is I dont know where she lives. Even more bad news is my sister knows her brother. So if I show up then word will spread etc. If I dont show then I will have to live with this untill school starts again. Yeah I messed up on this.,MiddleSchool,cs40bwo,1,t5_2t7au
