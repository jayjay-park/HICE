7802817,0,t1_d3sh9y9,Thank you you are absolutely right about the misspelling. The reason I addressed it is because it was mistranslated as dirt and wood instead of a wooden mallet. The point about pairing the verb with the object was that we need to keep it straight which verbs go with which objects. So the verb originally used in the translation to act on the seal is not used that way in English. Thats why I suggested stamp or any of the others as an alternative. ,NHKEasyNews,d3t3inh,1,t5_33lye
