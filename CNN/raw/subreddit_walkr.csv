6484567,0,t3_44f090,katziel that is a nice pattern in the beginning I did the same. but once you have more than  planets the newest ones eats like more than  food at a time. and then  dfr pr  planets is not enough anymore. I went then  for every  planet and now i do planet dfr planet dfr. that means i get some extra food too that I can spend on epics.  I think I will end up with somewhere between  dfrs in total when I end the game.,walkr,czq1w4b,1,t5_37xbf
7175155,0,t3_4bnsfo,cool Tarra. We have just finished our last challenge and we are heading to the reward. I will create the new fleet when i wake up tomorrow morning european time which is late evening US time. We launch when everyone has cashed there rewards from this epic and have accepted my invite. I will be sure to invite you. I will have to warn you though. My players are very dedicated at fast! They are not greedy but youll have to be on spot at the second a challenge starts if you want to get a chance to donate. There is no waiting and no mercy  Sometimes you will not get to donate if all  players are there even though you are ready. that happened to all of us.We have a lot of fun though and there is a great team spirit on the team.We are doing Floating... and Ill call the fleet Sorens Fleet ,walkr,d1tqyru,1,t5_37xbf

11582920,0,t1_dg7ygyi,I can see that and I definitely dont use energy for that anymore now that I am trying epics.  I have been more interested in extra storage but it is taking me longer and longer to get through my little galaxy so I think I should probably be more mindful of speed than I have been.Thank you for the advice!,walkr,dg8xiro,2,t5_37xbf
