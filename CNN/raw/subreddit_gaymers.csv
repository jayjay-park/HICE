What they dont realize is keeping it intimate and private means acting straight some weird neutral thing.

Ive only watched  but Ive heard its a bit slow in the beginning.  was pretty decent as well.The Last of Us is also amazing.Assassins Creed Black Flag is great especially if you like the idea of naval combat.I highly recommend the Ratchet and Clank Future series Tools of Destruction A Crack in Time Into the NexusHeavy Rain is amazing if you liked Beyond Two Souls many people consider Heavy Rain much much better though Beyond has much better acting. If you didnt like Beyond still give Heavy Rain a try! The story is much more cohesive.BioshockBioshock Infinite. Avoid spoilers and youre in for a treat. Many people criticize the game play of Infinite but I thought the atmosphere and story more then made up for it. One of my favorite games of last year.Mirrors Edge. Its short but sweet.  ME is currently in development. Really fun parkour.DMC Devil May Cry if you like hackslash games. Its tons of fun.Rayman OriginsRayman Legends are great platformers.RPGsDragon Age Origins. One of my favorite RPGs of all time. There is a lot of choice in the story and the tactical combat is great. I played this on PC though so I believe the PS version doesnt have top down tactical. Regardless many people consider this Biowares last masterpiece.The Mass Effect series. The ending is incredibly divisive but ME is incredible.Kingdom Hearts . HD Remix. There are some mechanics that are slightly outdated but if you like Disney and fun combat or you like the series in general then . HD is a great way to playreplay it. . should be coming out soon too.Final Fantasy XX HD is a great way to experience a pretty good FF I personally didnt like Tidus.RPGs I havent played but hear are great!Ni No Kuni Wrath of the White WitchValkyria Chronicles,gaymers,cgtu5sd,2,t5_2s9n5

878102,1,t3_245qwf, I think Wildstars appeal is going to depend on how familiar you are with the genre how old you are in real life and how burned out you are from the typical MMORPG fare.Wildstar seems specifically designed to hook the new generation of gamers specifically preteens who are too young to be invested in WoW but want a nice themepark they can devote themselves to. This is evident not only by the cartoony quests but the general saccharine feeling I got everywhere I went.  And this isnt a bad thing. I love cartoony graphics it was just apparent to me that I wasnt this games target audience and I wouldnt be able to appreciate it fully since Im over the tried and true kill  fetch  quests. Even the subscription model seems stale.The path system is cool. The housing system is cool. The graphics are nice. And the combat is ok. I guess you could call it Action but to me the best action combat I ever encountered in an MMORPG was in Dungeons and Dragons online. If all you knew was WoW combat then Wildstars version is going to seem like a breath of fresh air.,gaymers,ch43dvu,1,t5_2s9n5

I was just reading articles into this and there was an outrage over how Mass Effect  included male gay relationships and how out of character it was even in a series where you define nearly everything about your playable character. There were people complaining about how Anders flirt with a male protagonist in Dragon Age .There is a really sad aspect of straight male culture in which even entertaining thoughts about homosexuality is often seen as degrading. You dont hear about sexual experimentation those who do often keep it a secret and think its shameful which contributes to more closeted gay and bi men. Some people have better experiences depending on where they live but this is still prevalent in many places.As games are often intended to the young straight male public they reflect this idea not only that women should be sexualized but also that men are not supposed to ever.,gaymers,ciahp8z,3,t5_2s9n5

Naoto flat out says she started crossdressing because no one took her seriously as a female detective. She never said that she felt uncomfortable as a female or that she ever considered herself to be male. Her shadow just took the Im going to pretend to be a boy because people will take me more seriously to the extreme. Kanjis a little more of a gray area. His shadow is also taking things to the extreme but while he says he isnt really into men he didnt seem to have a big problem with it when he thought Naoto was into him when he was a boy.

1418474,0,t3_2acrix,just finished... Pretty good and again love the how you pointed out last of uss Bill. I feel there can always be a good gay or trans or bi character in any medium as long as you dont make it all flaunty unless its for satire sake and to be fair even if they are flaunty they can still be charming if written well and realistically. One of my favorite gay characters in games is probably gay tony in GTA... he does follow some of the stereotypes that can kill a lgbt character but he is also so fantastically written that it just makes it feel like thats just apart of his character! ,gaymers,ciu31ep,2,t5_2s9n5

2096983,0,t3_2ix0ue,Ive always wanted to seeplay a game that uses gender fluidity as the the central game mechanic. Similar to something like The Lost Vikings. Basically the character is genderfluid and can shift on a scale between masculine and feminine and depending on where they land on the scale they are able to pass certain obstacles or beat certain tasks. Im not sure how that would take shape but I think games lend themselves nicely to the idea of gender fluidity and you can explore a lot around that just using simple game design techniques.,gaymers,cl6dfuh,3,t5_2s9n5

All other races and genders are sitting at an even  a piece. So no one sexuality has any favoritism and the people argueing are just being moronic. Like with DA everyone hated that all the characters where playersexual and apparently it was offensive to straight males.Heres a very cringeworthy article about the straight guys complaining about the romance options in DA.Its just a complaint people always seem to have with Bioware games for no real reason other than to sound ignorant.Edit Bisexual Elven females actually have a total of  romance option. So if anything Bioware is all for that cross species sexualness.Edit Ok so apparently Sera does not register in my mind for whatever reason. So a Bisexual Elf female has  possible romance options.

2815182,0,t3_2sc0in,The short answer to your question is yes.I was in a similar situation a year ago and even now that I have a job I still play this game every chance I get. Ive sunk countless hours into it and will sink many more before I get bored.Updates are frequent every  months or so with new content being added all the time. To top it off the games first expansion is due to come out in a few months and thatll bring a metric buttload of new content jobs etc.I am enchanted with FF and its the best MMO currently out there in my humble opinion. As for whether a lot of people play I highly recommend finding a populated server and sticking to it. Faerie if youre in NA is a huge server full of incredibly nice players. The EU server I play on Lich is pretty small and basically all the people doing endgame raids know each other. Depends what you prefer I guess!

2838338,0,t3_2shlue,The game has a lot of faults. Its too short and it feels like it was cut down from what it was supposed to be by a lot. After you beat the story there are only raids PVP or weekly strikes to do. The story also doesnt really tell you much it doesnt really conclude anything and its very barebones in any sort of presentation or characterization. Most of the actual lore is presented outside of the game in grimoire cards that you have to find on their site. The game is also a lot of grinding and farming. You have to grind reputation points to buy better gear by doing the same things over and over again. To get material to upgrade this gear in any timely fashion at least you have to run the same loops around certain areas in maps and it becomes very monotonous and tedious. One could go on and on about complaints of the game. Frankly in the state it is in now even with the DLC expansion and another upcoming it still doesnt feel like a complete game.But enough about the negatives it does actually have some nice positives. Despite what I have said it can be really fun at times especially if you do have people to play with. The gunplay is solid and I personally loved the hand cannons. The character abilities are fun to play around with and they make the PVP and fights very fast paced and unique. The character designs are also very nice and I love the flowing cloth physics and armor customization. The lore is still very interesting and leaves a lot of mystery to it even if it is mostly locked outside of the game. The environments are beautifully designed and unique from one another in appearance. The alien races are all distinct in appearance and while they can all be handled the same way more or less they do have some variations that make you change your play style a bit. The two raids that are available as of now are both very interesting and different from one another. Personally I feel the first raid The Vault of Glass is a much fuller experience though and had more work put into it. It has large explorable areas and it all feels very large and grand and it progressively gets darker and more corrupted as you go deeper. The other raid Crotas End is more linear and has a lot less exploration. But I believe the raid as a whole can be much harder even when you are at the appropriate level. The setting is also very cool and macabre with lots of black and green shit everywhere. ,gaymers,cnqproj,1,t5_2s9n5

The definition of assume even includes ...without proofYou assume when you wake up and think it is Friday just to find out its only Thursday after looking at your phone.

Its hard and its final but it makes sure you dont stumble across his number going through contacts or going to text someone else and it keeps you from checking to see if hes texted multiple times a day when youre feeling lonely and sad.A clean break is almost always quicker to heal from.

3887549,0,t1_cqzap68,No not really.. Why would anyone on rgaymers endorse an antigay slur?. The primary reason for censoring the word faggot is to avoid upsetting LGBT people. The article posted covers things that will probably upset LGBT readers anyway.. Like that whole Louis CK bit points out using NWord euphemisms just makes the reader hear it in their head anyway so its kinda redundant when thats exactly what saying a word is in the first place.I know people will differ but it just seems very arbitrary to me.,gaymers,cqzexbi,2,t5_2s9n5

3995752,0,t1_crbadet,I think the crux of it comes down to thisgt If youve played a minute game about being a transwoman Anthrophy told me dont pat yourself on the back for feeling like you understand a marginalized experience.And you really hit the nail on the headgt The article seems to assume that achieving any form of understanding is obviously a good thing. But small incomplete understanding especially in the hands of those with power can lead people to people to make poor choices whether by trying to help or intervene in ways that are counterproductive speak for a marginalized group instead of letting them speak for themselves or just make poor decisions about controversial issues due to incomplete knowledge of the topic.She really didnt intend the game for a cisgender audience and she doesnt like her art being used for this purpose. I think thats a reasonable thing to express and feel.? At the same time though... Its also very reasonable to be worried that someone who played a game might come away with the impression that Now I understand instead of Now I have some additional perspective.  That is actually dangerous as you said.  Its that kind of thing that can breed comments like one that I ran across the other day where someone actually said to megt I think if we were to wave a magic wand and make everyone apathetic to gaytransgender ...people most of those people would find their lives little changed.Thats a stupid statement. Just profoundly profoundly stupid and utterly disconnected from reality. Any LGBT person could tell you that. Anyone paying a lick of attention should be able to tell you that. But too many people think they have a handle on what its like and as you pointed out that feeling is dangerous when it leads people to think that all the problems are solved and nothing more needs to be done. See also declarations that racism is over after the election of our current president and how well those have panned out.People should always strive for more empathy and more understanding. But they also need to be introspective and realize that there are perspectives and aspects that they just cannot fully grasp no matter how hard they try.Now I personally dont agree with the manner in which Anna responded. Anger can put people off and hurt the movement sometimes. But its not up to me whos never had to live through transitioning or deal with the way society treats trans people to tell her how to feel about this. Its also not up to us to categorize every persons emotions as being helpful or unhelpful. People live lives and they shouldnt expected to be some kind of fulltime walking brand ambassador for whatever maligned minority group theyre a part of. Sometimes people just have feelings and they need to express them. We of all people should be understanding of that.Besides anger does have its place within movements for change. Martin Luther King Jr. may not have gotten very far without the fear of Malcolm X or the Black Panthers. The response to AIDS would certainly have continued to be nonexistent if not for the radical and angry actions of ACT UP The gay rights movement may not have kicked off and we might not be so far on our way to gaining a place at the table currently without the angry patrons of the Sonewall Inn. Wed all do well to to not forget that sometimes anger is justified and it can be just as potent a force for social change as living openly and honestly has been.And if anyone in our little alphabet has a right to be angry right now its trans people. As LGB people begin to lose our stigma and gain social acceptance too many of us have been willing to unburden ourselves of our T baggage. And as discrimination against gay people has become more socially unacceptable more and more heat has been applied to the trans community  after all theyre still different and scary enough to use as a political punching bag for now. Id be pissed off too like as not.A couple of semirelated blog posts this made me think of from Andrew Sullivans archives How to Survive a Plague  a post about ACT UP and the AIDS epidemic.

I think that there was too much focus on OMG look at me Im a trans character and active LGBT activist!! rather than focusing on other aspects of her life.     Regarding the actor just because the actor is trans this doesnt mean that she is a good actor. There is more to acting than sharing similarities with the character. For an example of a trans actor that is also an amazing actor look at Laverne Cox.     Also as far as I understand the term actor is used regardless of the gender of the actor.    On the subject of Lito Prior to the psychic orgy scene which was a great scene prior to Lito starting to experience the experiences of others there was definitely a scene with him and his  lovers cuddling in bed. I understand that the sharing senses things expands and makes a persons sexuality more fluid at least while sharing senses BUT to me his sexuality already seemed more to the middle of the sliding scale. ,gaymers,crypwms,2,t5_2s9n5

5049972,0,t3_3k1zsu,Im not certain how to feel about this article as the point it seems to be making to me misses the mark at best.To me I read this article as I love the bodies of swimmers the shape the movement so serene but I hate the bodies of shotputters so squat amp bulky and aggressive.  I think shotputters should have swimmers builds because thats much more in line with my own personal opinion of what an athlete should look like.The issue the article brings up isnt like the whole female body armor that amounts to little more than a gstring problem which is clearly an impractical outfit borne of a desire for aesthetics over functionality.  Rather this article seems to be criticizing game makers for giving certain characters bodies that are appropriate of that characters profession even though it violates the authors personal sense of masculinity and aesthetics.Of course the bodies of characters in shooters or fantasy games wielding big ass guns and big ass swords are going to be huge and aggressive and of course the bodies of characters in stealth games are going to be more slender and lithe.A hulking behemoth of a human being would not make for a good stealth agent any more than a slim androgynous human being would make for a good marauder who wields an M Vulcan in one hand.The article seems to be criticizing these design decisions as if they are entirely arbitrary rather than born of the practical realities of what it takes to be a good stealth agent versus a good shock trooper.Not only that the article offensively equates physical appearance with attitude and aggressiveness  a rather judge a book by its cover mentality that is really counter to the efforts of the LGBT community to communicate that there is a lot more to a person than their physical appearance.gt The male bodies in shooters ... are greedy unpopular children behaving in all the ways men are told we have to but cant all the ways that wreak havoc big and small on ourselves and those around us in the real world.Just wow.  I do not understand how a trans person could be so judgmental over another persons physical appearance or how they could so blithely state that another persons physical appearance clearly indicates whether or not they are a good person.

If you have a couple hundred viewers  or  days per week then its no problem. Any less than that and its up to twitch to decide if they think you will are worth making partner meaning should they spend time on you when you are going to just leave in a month or something. ,gaymers,cv02pl4,1,t5_2s9n5

And it is possible for someone who identifies as a gay man to fall in love with and marry a woman.  Its not just that everyone is one of two binaries for the rest of their lives.

5716176,0,t3_3tf764,No. Just no. This is the worst idea I have seen on here. This is absolutely awful. What this is is called Catfishing. You use a picture of someone other then yourself to lure someone in for a date or sexual deeds and most guys wont just run off because you dont look the same as you do on your profile because they dont want to be rude but trust me you will NEVER hear from them again after that first date.Now listen here people. You need to get this through your head and Im gonna be blunt. The world doesnt revolve around you you are not everyones type. If you are on a Dating App everyone has the right to be picky. If someone doesnt like how you look they dont have to message you back and creating a fake profile with a fake picture sure as hell might fix your looks but its not going to fix your shitty personality. You are forgoing actual human interaction and instead meeting someone as a picture and text on a screen.I met my boyfriend through OKCupid for instance. Do you know how long I was on OKCupid? Literally forever. Because I was picky. Didnt like the way this guy looked didnt like the way this guy worded his profile etc. I am not going to settle for just any guy just because I wanted a boyfriend so you SHOULDNT lie about your looks and personality online just because you are some desperate idiot.Edit Not to mention just because someone doesnt like how you look doesnt make them Shallow. Physical attraction and Emotional attraction are both needed to make a relationship work except in certain cases depending on your sexuality obviously.,gaymers,cx5nblv,1,t5_2s9n5

6008625,0,t3_3xr67u,this article feels like its at odds with itself for me.  it cites zevran as being a stereotypical gay man but places dorian in the good example category for romancables. it also mentions how garrus isnt attractive.  trying to stay impartial on this i enjoyed garrus relationship with shepard more than kaidans and would have preferred an option for mshep to romance garrus though ultimately its probably better to leave them as friends its understandable that garrus might be too alien looking.  however there are still human male alternatives that are attractive in jacob and kaidan.  funnily enough it seems like people rate thane and garrus romances higher than jacob and kaidan.  i suppose the ultimate goal for the articles writer is a sexy human guy with a well written story.mass effect is a space fantasy game romance with aliens is one of the unique traits that the genre allows it to dive in to the ability to have a character that can suck on an asari crest or turian dick.  ,gaymers,cy79fwk,16,t5_2s9n5

I keep trying to go back to it gods know I spent enough on gems over the years but I just cant. It pisses me off and it bores me and I get hopeful every update read the patch notes and try to play and realise I still cant stand what it has become and that Im just lusting after Guild Wars  with an updated combat system. But yeah black desert is really damn fun as long as you can grind a bit its not even that overwhelming as long as you pick a fun class to do it on its kinda boring on my Valkyrie but in my Musa grinding is absurdly fun on my wizard it literally puts me to sleep but my ranger is fun. Only thing to look out for is that some classes are entirely genderlocked while others are slightly different from gender valk is female and warrior is male theyre similarish in mechanics and use identical equipment but have a lot of mobility differences wizard and witch are identical you can only have a female tamer or a male berserker and they play totally different from each other musa and maehwa are very similar except musa had better aoe in the form of ignoring cooldowns where maehwa has better single target nukes ninja and kunoichi are supposed to be rather similar except for their focus on the offhand weapon which both have access to both options one is just innately better for to skill synergy.,gaymers,d2hpwwg,1,t5_2s9n5

On top of that your preferences arent a part of some idealized abstract core of being innate to your existence its very impressionable by your environment. Its not like a sexual orientation.And on top of that when a lot of people seem to have the exact same set of preferences right down to racial preferences it begins to paint a bigger picture than just one persons tastes one which illustrates the sort of environment that would produce such tastes.You dont have to date anyone you dont like but thats not at all what this is really about. ,gaymers,d353df4,13,t5_2s9n5

I started with Taken King but from what I understand much has changed  max level is  and most important thing is light level max currently  which your gear will not come close to.  Theyve added a decent amount of story and the first couple missions are designed to get you to  quickly.  The new raid Kings Fall doesnt kick in until you get high up there in LL . I dont do raiding though I dont know enough people and Im still only  I dont get to play that much.And yes upgrading weapons is much easier.  All you need is the right ingredient which you can buy for legendary marks from the vanguard vendor and weapon parts now also purchasable from the gunsmith.  All you need for increasing the light level of a legendary is a weapon or armor in the same category with a higher light level which can be a blue you decrypted and some legendary marks and motes of light which youll likely have plenty of you can get easy marks by just doing dailies. ,gaymers,d3givnq,2,t5_2s9n5

Its a fantasy setting with an entirely different history culture and language than our own yes I know they use English in Dragon Age but one can assume the etymology of their words is just as fictional as the rest of the universe. And as Ive posted above that scene with Dorian is one of the most unambiguously explicitly notholdingback gay scenes in video game history. Dorian was written by a gay man and that scene was written by a gay man and Gaider decided to not use one word that we keep focusing on instead of taking into account everything else about Dorian and that scene. ,gaymers,d4r68ul,4,t5_2s9n5

A few dicks pop up here and there such is the Internet.And like everyone else says its really up to you or in this particular instance the Moderators to take responsibility for whatever content you end up viewing. If you do not want to see something then dont. Or block it.There are lots of ways to go about it and more often than not the truly NSFW stuff ends up being relatively unpopular. I mean of course there are people that upvote it and actually like it but most of the time some article about Pokemon or the latest and greatest RPG out of Japan with gay romances will end up the most popular submission of the day.,gaymers,d5galup,3,t5_2s9n5

The only mandatory romance stuff revolves around Geralts very very complicated relationships with two women. Theres some sexy stuff you can participate in with them but again its optional and I actually find these relationships very interesting because they are surprisingly mature and adult for a game with a reputation of sleazy chauvinistic sex scenes. I mean dont get me wrong the game absolutely wants you to fuck every woman in sight and will make it very clear by way of wardrobe selection and camera angles which vaginas are open for business but it is optional nonetheless. ,gaymers,dcxns9q,40,t5_2s9n5

But rpdr attracts a very specific category of person that is privy to the nuances of their personality in a very visible way. Drag Queens.

11573606,0,t3_654d5h,Just be aware that PS emulation does require a decent amount of processing power I.E. you need significantly more power than for a ps emulator. Also if you cant get a certain game to work there is probably a bug fix or a configuration setting you do not have checked correctly so browse forums if you are having issues because most of the time the people there are spot on and you can fix your problem quickly. That being said for ps games it depends on the genre but here are some recommendations  RPGs FFX FFXII Shadow HeartsCovenant Dark Cloud  Valkyrie profile .  ActionAdventure Devil may Cry  and   is garbage lol Jak and Daxter series ratchet and clank series Prince of Persia series Okami shadow of the Colossus.My favorite game for PS zone of the Enders  unfortunately wont run on seemingly any PS emulator and nobody can seem to get this game to work no matter what settings they configure.
