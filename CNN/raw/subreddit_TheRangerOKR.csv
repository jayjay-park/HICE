1587868,0,t1_cjfberu,Yup! Its a bit tricky to build but hits nicely on the Ranger. Its a cooler vape  the first one I grabbed after getting it on the way out. At some point in the future Ill experiment around with different atties to find the one I like best for the Ranger.,TheRangerOKR,cjfblqu,1,t5_316jo

2040049,0,t3_2i5uol,Different chips different styles. Vw will calculate how many Volts to push to achieve it vv means you do some Math with your resistance and voltage. But with vv youre going to get a constant output. Think of it manual vs automatic transmission. Vv is you control the gears and Rpms vw is you pick a speed with the pedal and your car figures it out. One is hand made by one person so you get a better quality to the ranger than you would a mass produced product in China like the ipv. Plus the ranger is customizable and raffs the makers customer service is the best Ive ever seen. You need something fixed? Done. Raff makes an upgrade? Send it in and he will do it for you. Having problems or questions with your mod? Heres a sight where the creator himself will give you personal feedback. Cant get that with the ipv. The biggest thing I look at is how many problems or complaints do you see about the ipv on recr and how often do you here about a ranger shitting out on someone? Thats my two cents lol. Ranger all the way. Ps Im drunk maybe someone else can explain it better hope it helped,TheRangerOKR,ckz4vyk,3,t5_316jo

2298574,0,t3_2ll758, here.  Yes when I fire my Ranger without an atty it can display both the battery voltage and firing voltage.I would rebuild your questionable atty.  As well take a qtip and cotton and clean your  connector area.Can you take pics and attach to this thread?,TheRangerOKR,clvtips,3,t5_316jo
2335684,0,t1_cm05nz4,i have the clone as well and i have all of the airflow options...my wife bought me a Little Boy RDA to go with my new Ranger and the airflow in that was much to much so I put that on my IPV which i run at  watts and it works very well.,TheRangerOKR,cm0eiyq,1,t5_316jo
