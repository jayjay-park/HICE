11745981,0,t3_67lqtj,I watched the movie again today and it cleared some more things up. Originally I thought Itomori being destroyed was the same night as the date with Okuderosempai because of Mitsuhas note you should be able to see the comet after your date but the comet was actually visible across multiple days. This is confirmed on one of the news broadcasts. The night of the festival was the night the comet was brightest as viewed from Earth. According to this link  I think the shrine visit was  the date was  and the comet hit Itomori on . I think Mitsuha went to Tokyo on  also as she also told Yotsuha it was for a date but not hers. Hope that helps. ,KimiNoNaWa,dgrfq7h,2,t5_3gak6
