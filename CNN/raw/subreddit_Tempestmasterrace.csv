1502822,0,t1_cj4m2ly,The amount of change that his slight selfexposition represented was somewhat lost on me the first time reading through as I was convinced then that he was the main villain. Reading now its clear that that is indeed a pivotal moment for Hans and I realize that I was giving him a little too much credit for his actions preceding the scene however that part of him that allowed himself to crack in front of Anna had always been there its just that it took Anna to bring it out.,Tempestmasterrace,cj4nhu7,1,t5_329m7

1654532,0,t1_cjnhag5,Dont worry about catching up on the reread. Im trying to come up with a way to revamp it so its more accessible.As for flairs... you can point half of your fingers at charred and the other half at me. Theres flairs available but Im not happy with how theyre implemented. As in theyre still squares and not cutouts of the images. If I could get them as cutouts wed have about  flairs available.,Tempestmasterrace,cjnptvo,1,t5_329m7
1707223,0,t3_2dy7mw,Poor Edmund... there was something incredibly daunting about him putting out the flames and letting the shadows creep over him. Its like he was trying to remove all that pain and confusion and all those unanswered questions from himself but the imagery of him putting out the fire seemed more like the shadows of his father had finally overtaken him and that he hasnt realized it yet. I cant even imagine what thatd feel like to be in his position. His entire life was a lie. That changes someone. Really I wouldnt be surprised to see his entire character change now. I feel like he might take influence from the path of his father in order to understand his father.I think Annas realized how in over her head she used to be. Shes looking around and shes not seeing the beauty of Elsas ice anymore. Everything thats happened...gt Anna missed home.Now shes back at square one except for everything shes seen and experienced. Thats going to stay with her for the rest of her life.And now during this conversation with Elsa between her Elsas casual demeanor and her hair being down it seems like Elsa and Anna have switched places from where they used to be in the beginning. Elsa is trying to connect to Anna and Anna is remaining reserved because of her emotional torment just like how Elsa remained reserved due to her lack of emotion.gt ...the Sorcerer mustve held a grudge against me.gt But I dont pretend to understand Gustaf...I know she hasnt reconciled that they are the same person but its almost like she cant bear to believe that Gustaf might have hated her. I cant tell if that would be because of some previous respect she held for Gustaf or perhaps because of some sort of empathy she might feel now knowing that Gustaf shared her plight of not having a heart.gt ...as if my vision were blinded.So shes just now started to acknowledge that as a possibility. Unfortunately it may be too late. It doesnt seem like acknowledging her  blindness is going to help her win Anna back now. It may have earlier but I dont think Anna can truly trust Elsa anymore. If Elsa told her that she realized how blind she was I think Anna might be too frightened to accept her again. Just a hypothesis.gt Immediately Elsa stiffened.gt Perhaps later I can arrange for that.I think Elsa is truly selfish. Im not sure she really loves Anna but that she loves her idea of Anna. Again with that turning of the tables. Anna used to have this solipsism of Elsa and now it seems like Elsa has fully embraced a solipsism of Anna. She knows how Anna makes her feel and she cant bear to be rid of that. Would she rather Anna be unhappy here just so that she herself may be happy? But she can never be happy while Anna is unhappy. Though I cant say I blame this all on Elsa. I blame Markus. This all happened because of Markus. He brainwashed Elsa. I dont see any way that Elsa could make this entire situation work without her heart. But now that shes feeling again I dont think shes going to accept letting go of the one thing that makes her feel.After finishing reading the chapter it may seem like my hypothesis in these last two paragraphs cant be true but I still feel like theres an element of possibility of what Im suggesting here. Anna went from despondent to allout supportive so quickly. Its not the first time weve seen Anna give it her all in regards to Elsa only to have that bond compromised. I think that despite the reconciliation theyve reached at the end of this chapter Elsa is still maintaining a solipsism of Anna and might continue to act selfishly accordingly and that Anna lacks trust in Elsa though I think shes trying to avoid that distrust because she does genuinely care about Elsa. I still see the potential for huge disruptions in their relationship.Okay I definitely need to reread all the chapters that take place between Elsas return and the confrontation with the Sorcerer again. Its been a while since I last read them. I remember Elsa was super distant from Anna. To the point where it seemed like Elsa didnt care about her anymore. Now I know better but Im also accepting that Elsa is truly an enigma hmm... who else did we always say was an enigma? Oh thats right Gustafthe Sorcerer.This might be the most revealing scene of Elsa weve seen so far. For someone whos so convinced that shes not making sense of anything Im finding her more true in this moment than ever before. Though Im not sure if its a subconscious act a side effect of the reliquary or if shes truly opening up to Anna like this for the first time.gt ...I hoped I would failI think this is the turning moment the moment when Elsa finds herself on the path to salvation or the path to becoming exactly like the Sorcerer and what Markus always wanted her to be.gt Im not like you. Im... flawed.So Elsa really does see Anna as perfect.gt Then I can be your heart.What Ive noticed is that it seems to be when Elsa is at her worst is when Anna makes these boldest of moves in their relationship. Even when Anna seems to be disillusioned with Elsa. In this situation I think Anna was at her most confounded in regards to Elsa and yet here she is making an equally bold choice to repair their bond. This is one of those no turning back choices. I wonder if she wouldve been so bold had Elsa not acted out.,Tempestmasterrace,cjucvii,3,t5_329m7
1714531,0,t1_cjuu8tp,I dont know why most people think this chapter is a happy one... theres so much fear angst!! Elsa has gone a little bit crazy with all the anxiety stuff. Like what Kenneth has said to me their relationship was so unhealthy. I mean yea they kissed but what thats not even a romantic or sweet one. It just made me feel that therere moreangst to come....D,Tempestmasterrace,cjva1ml,2,t5_329m7
1780002,0,t1_ck3io3o,See I thought I could cram Edmunds reveal and Elsannas convo PLUS them actually going to Arendelle into one chapter . I then thought okay Edmunds reveal in one chapter  and the convo and travel to Arendelle in the next . GUESS WHAT HAPPENED. Really I cannot plan chapter content for shit.,Tempestmasterrace,ck3iv2e,1,t5_329m7
2047958,0,t1_ckzlyp3,I want to amend my theory as to what Wraiths are. Is Elsa one because she surpresses all forms of love? Building Olaf was a different act of love than what she feels for Anna after all and if Annas loss of white hair is any indication it seems to amount to something... ,Tempestmasterrace,cl052ha,1,t5_329m7
