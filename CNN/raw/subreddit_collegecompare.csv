11336466,0,t3_61pwtb,Unless the school in question is an Ivy or an Ivy in everything except name stanford berkley Vandy never go out of state. I go to FIU and the business school is pretty good. Youre in a city where lots of business is done especially international business. Having little to no debt upon graduation is always better than going to some I suspect marginally better school. Ive never even heard of Marist until your post. ,collegecompare,dfgyvuq,1,t5_3jpkt

Also a ton of kids get ibankingfinance internships there and get placed into those jobs respectively upon graduation. This seems like an easy choice here  go to Stern.,collegecompare,dfxe9c1,2,t5_3jpkt
