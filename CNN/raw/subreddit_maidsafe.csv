762587,0,t1_cgqy93c,gt As another note I dont like safe encrypt because it allows as far as I can tell for files which have  or more continuous chunks identical to a known document which is surprisingly common to be decrypted very easily by a malicious party. Obviously there are ways around this by mixing up the chunk ordering but it will always still be easy to decrypt documents which have only very slight differences in data.I think you are confusing something there. SafeEncrypt is for encrypting messages etc. Self Encrypt is for data that then gets chunked. There is no continuous identical chunks ever stored duplicates are not sent. You can see the code in MaidSafeEncrypt for that part.,maidsafe,cgqynao,1,t5_2zynj
796299,0,t1_cgusblq,gt safecoins should not be launched on top of mastercoin. There will be too many bugs in the code the source code doesnt even implement the specification as far as I can tell.This is not safecoins people are buying it is a MaidSafeCoin or MSAFE as the code will be that will be swapped on a  basis when safecoin is available on the network.The exact technical implementation I think this is what you mean is that all bitcoin to the exodus address will be matched in MSC by BitAngels and they process the MSC MSAFE coin automatically.  So BTCgtMSCMSAFE is what would happen of course MSCgtMSAFE is also automatic. I think this is what you mean. On the spec being horrible or the code then I am perhaps less familiar with the difficulties. Can you tell us what part of the spec is wrong? or is it a more general feeling.,maidsafe,cgusjav,1,t5_2zynj

1436240,0,t1_civp6x1,I wouldnt pretend to know what is the best hardware setup but in any case there will be other factors that will vary for each of us physical space available budget acceptable noise level power efficiency personal OS preferences etc.If you have some hardware you are happy to leave on permanently I suggest you use that maybe beef up with a big disk. If you are like me concerned about size power consumption and noise look at some of the cheap Linux devices such as Odroid or Excito B.Also see the forum SafeCoin category where some hardware options are being discussed. ,maidsafe,ciwb55k,2,t5_2zynj

2720736,0,t3_2r7yy7,Youll find more about all these on the forum at  but here are some short responses.gt How exactly are the MaidSafe coins mined?Users run a vault application and specify how much disk space to share with the network and chunks of encrypted data will be stored on these vaults each file having first been chopped up encrypted and sent out to vaults at random locations. No one knows where a piece of data is stored I know sounds impossible but its true!. When a file is accessed a request makes its way to one of several vaults holding each chunk and the first vault to provide the data gets a chance to farm some safecoin. This is the proof of resource mechanism  providing the data. So every time your vault is first to respond with a chunk it gets a chance to farm safecoin and if successful the wallet linked to the vault gets credited.gt Would it be possible for an entity such as a large data host provider to provide a large portion of the network resources say for example  of the bandwidthstorage upload several small pieces of data to the network and then repeatedly make requests to the data pieces that are distributed to just their  of the network. Could they then collect the mining reward for all these requests and also receive the associated request fees even though they are basically just serving themselves?No there are several mechanisms that prevent this. One is caching. Repeated requests for data cause it to be cached nearer and nearer the requester. Another is that noone controls what data is stored where as noted in my first answer so requesting data stored on your own vaults is not possible. gt Whats preventing MaidSafe from being supported using bitcoin where users would just pay for their data requests on the bitcoin blockchain?The blockchain is not suitable for high volumes of transactions such as micropayments. SAFE network has its own currency that is much more scalable and efficient. It also ensures true anonymity unlike bitcoin. Safecoin transactions will be confirmed almost instantly and will scale with the size of the network so tens or hundreds or millions etc. of transactions per second will be achievable as the networks scales. Confirmation only requires small random anonymous groups of nodes to be involved and so is also far more energy efficient where the entire network works on each block until it is sufficiently confirmed. At the same time it is far harder to mount a doublespend type attack requiring over  of the network compared to the bitcoin  attack theory and at the same time there is no incentive to centralise i.e. no point in farming pools so the risk of an  attack is further mitigated.  ,maidsafe,cndc3ty,2,t5_2zynj
