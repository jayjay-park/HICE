824428,0,t1_cgxqxwk,It doesnt matter if people are excited about womens rugby or not. The USAR CEO will not raise the necessary funds to financially support ALL of national teams. That is wrong. If a player is selected to play for a USA Rugby National Team Eagles or AllAmericans that player should not be concerned with how much it costs to represent their country OR if they will still have a job when the tour is over. If USAR cannot take care of its representatives in the most basic of manners it should stop trying. Or get a CEO who will make it happen.,USArugby,cgxzmbm,1,t5_2zmex

Several clubs wanted players but the draconian work visa rules in the EU countries prohibit such things from happening.Honestly rugby is the one of the last sports in the world in which every other country is better than the USA.

2188718,0,t1_clhv7dh,I have to agree withgt we may not be the best rugby team in the world but we sure as hell will never become a great rugby power if we cant even get support from ourselves!success will birth a patriotic fervor for the team. Give it time.One of the best aspects of rugby being an international game is the pride in ones country or chosen national team. I applaud the mantra to show ones colours but I wouldnt let that commie attitude stop any ABs fan from wearing what they want. There are more than a few South Africans who follow and support the ABs and that is the sports biggest rivalry  NZ amp Sth Africa. Capetown hasnt had a test match for  years because of the high support for the ABs. It does happen. But has that hindered the support of the Boks? NO WAY! Just check out the latest Ellis Park footage.In other words this game isnt like following a club. It encourages a fairness and creditwherecreditisdue attitude. Wear the colours with pride but leave the shittalk at homegt or some ugly tshirt with the Ka Mate haka on it. ,USArugby,cli1fgi,4,t5_2zmex

4045232,0,t1_crhdtiz, December Erik V. GeibClub Department ManagerUSA Rugby Arapahoe Ave Boulder CO For the Attention of Pacific Rugby Premiership Club RepresentativesDear AdministratorsI was recently informed that team representatives of the Pacific Rugby Premiership have collectively elected to forgo sanctioning by USA Rugby for the  competitive season specifically Spring  for the PRP competition. As such I wanted to take this opportunity to start the dialogue for next season so that we may have a strong partnership in time for the  competitive season.As I understand it all of the teams in your competition were able to review the offers of support from USA Rugby attached. The recording of these terms was a monthslong endeavor for which USA Rugby is grateful for the feedback of Sion Williams and Geno Mazza while the terms were being crafted. From phone calls inSeptember and October to the revising of drafted terms in November and December Geno and Sion were both immensely helpful during the process.It is a goal of the Club Department at USA Rugby USA Club Rugby to support and strengthen club teams and competitions throughout the United States. Though youve elected to remain unsanctioned this will not change. All of you are encouraged to pick up a phone and call me office  or write me an emailegeibusarugby.org whenever you feel so obliged. I recognize that some senior clubs in America have not always felt as though they were supported by USA Rugby but I ensure you that I will always do my best to elevate the quality and connectedness of our community.Unfortunately the decision to turn down sanctioning does mean that there are certain things that USA Rugby cannot provide as direct competition support at this time. Those items include assistance in promotion of your matches recognition of the PRP as an elite competition and deployment of national office resources  such as national match officials. Our resources are funded by the larger senior club community and our constituents are under the expectation that we have a social contract to all move forward together.I understand that a partial offer of competition resources last year has led some of you to believe that USA Rugby is trying to be punitive this year but that is far from the case. Appointment of national referees last year was actually at a reduced rate USA Rugbys former agreement with the RSL was for match and was put on the table with the thought that progress was being made towards coming together for this competitive season. This year we offered to cover all head match official costs including the addition of match fees for a total cost to USA Rugby of up to match. Regrettably we were not able to reach an understanding.Notably it has come to my attention that several of you have requested that USA Rugby reexamine its eligibility regulations regarding player movement between senior clubs. Discussions regarding this topic have been underway since Summer  but were tabled prior to the start of the  competitive season.We hope to continue with positive momentum on the subject as the regulations for  come into formation. As many of you are aware player movement issues in past regulations andor past competitions have had ripple effects throughout the rugby community that caused unintended consequences for club andcompetition stability. In order to minimize future disturbances we are exploring models such as transfer caps that should curtail or eliminate the impact of changes. When the American Rugby Premiership approached USA Rugby with direct proposals for change we actively worked with them to address their concerns and implement them in time for the start of their competitive season. Specifically the ARP requested that elite collegiate players in the High Performance pathway be allowed to play club rugby inseason without losing their collegiate eligibility. By working with the affected constituents the collegiate community and ensuring limitations to the implementation of the rule to prevent abuse we were able to get that change implemented with the unanimous endorsement of the Club Eligibility Committee Club Strategic Committee Rugby Committee and the USA Rugby Board of Trustees.Regarding clubtoclub movement for rugbyonly reasons as Im told youre requesting I will be polling the larger club community for feedback and hope you will engage me throughout the process. As a reminder to your clubs you are always able to recruit localregional players who have not played in a league match withanother club this season e.g. played for a different club last season and players who gain employment upon moving are always able to apply for a waiver for legitimate geographic relocation ..B of USA Rugbys Eligibility Regulations. Hopefully we can work together with the eligibility community to construct a model that recognizes the unique challenges of elite competitions while valuing the hard work we are all putting in collectively to sustain strong clubs and competitions.Moving forward the Club Department at USA Rugby hopes to see positive momentum towards the formation of an Elite Game Board for the amateur club game and will start assembling the pieces for a strong crossover competition to take place in the Spring of . PRP clubs that elect to abide by USA Rugby andor EGBregulations for the matches in that crossover competition will be invited to participate regardless of the regulations used by those teams in their outside competitions. You will see more details about this initiative as it progresses and hopefully you elect to engage all parties USA Rugby and the other competitions throughout the process.The Club Department is also launching a number of other initiatives that we would like to work with you on even if we cant currently use our platforms to promote your competition while it remains unsanctioned. The Club community will soon have its own website and will aggressively seek to expand its media presence inpromoting the senior game. We are also exploring broadcastquality webcasting of highprofile matches and are very excited about the updated robust features of our freetouse competition management system.Additionally we plan on creating a number of best practices documents for elevating the standards of all teams and competitions in America. As respected and successful members of our community we value whatever feedback you may elect to provide on those programs. The Club Department looks forward to continuing the conversation with your group in the future and Im confident that we can find a way to elevate the game together.All the best Erik V.

4157078,0,t3_3837nk,In the long term the US and Canada need a proper crossborder competition like in every other major international sport. In the short term I could see a way that this would be good for American rugby if a number of things fall into place Seattle gets kicked out of the BC Prem has to go somewhere else to find competition. The best option is the PRP. However the PRP arent really in USA Rugbys good books and perhaps Seattles return will force the two to mend bridges which will be good for rugby in America. ,USArugby,cru4a68,1,t5_2zmex

5789990,0,t1_cxepm87,Not that I know of. There will be opportunities for some young foreign players to commit to a pro team for a few years to enable naturalisation which would allow these players play for the Eagles. Same as any league around the world Scott Spedding of France Richardt Strauss of Ireland etc. I am sure there will be a few spots in the squads for international players who are nearing the end of their career and who cannot play for the Eagles. These guys will provide a wealth of knowledge for young American players. Getting the balance right will be the challenge. ,USArugby,cxesx3d,1,t5_2zmex
6397592,0,t1_czgmt9x,The problem with your bad news is that the pro teams have no power to stop USA Rugby from selecting players if they want to since its an official international window so you cant definitively read anything into the value the clubs place on those players. Given that most of the pros are only available for a match or two it looks like USAR and the pro clubs reached a compromise that may allow the U.S. to call these guys up outside of the international window at a later time.,USArugby,czgu9kv,5,t5_2zmex

It also helped that the US teaches soccer from a very very early age stages and Olympic team and has had world class soccer including womens national champions since forever.While I truly hope it grows in the US do not equate it to soccer.
