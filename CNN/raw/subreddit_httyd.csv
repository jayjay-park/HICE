59560,0,t1_cel34ig,Well theres definitely new dragons shown in the trailer including a large one that we only see a leg of. I hope thats not the main dragon challenger though  it looks smaller than the Red Death and regardless Hiccup and Toothless already won the small dragon vs big dragon battle. Rehashing that is pointless especially since all the vikings are so much more expetienced now than they were five years ago. I think it would be better if the main fight is against something fast and powerful like a skrill I feel the skrill vs night fury battle will conclude in the second seasons finale so it wont show up in the movie with a human rider on top and for future battles maybe only formidable human challengers sans dragons. The main antagonist in this next film seems to fit that former mark. In the trailer you can see dragons with human riders on top that are at least it seems coming from his army.In the next film or even a new tv season it would be nice if part of the world expansion they do encounter Romans or even the Mongols who do not rely on dragons or other mythical beasts and have a strong history of military and strategic genius. Dragons are very formidable but theyre obviously not invincible even against a humanonly army and their innovative weaponry and tactics. ,httyd,cel7mis,1,t5_2teon

If the music is equally as nonintrusive as Powells I dont think most people will have a problem with it.Also as a sidenote to your remarks about the First Five Minutes clip Theres no way thats the true first five minutes. Near the end of the Dragon Race theres parts shown in the Dragon Racing clip that are missing from the First Five Minutes clip in a way that doesnt seem smooth aka not a way that would make it to the final movie imo.,httyd,chghzj9,3,t5_2teon

Its not often you see the hero hurt and maimed with an ending that is not  perfect as in Hiccup did not gain victory unscathed but perfectly happy never the less. It was a film that let the audience feel and grow. But also the growth between two former enemies was incredible.

1476821,0,t3_2b38qe,Agree with everything about Valka and Ruffnut.gt We have a mother who defied her assigned gender role for reasons that were her own and lived a life valuable to her  she is not shamed or attacked for itIts pretty amazing to think about it really. Valka is undoubtedly not what you would call an ideal mother. But I love how it doesnt make her any less of a character and the filmakers made sure to let us know that. Whether Valkas decision is right or wrong they let the audience decide but ultimately everything is Valkas decision and I love it.On the subject of Ruffnut her infatuation with Eret is actually very incharacter even if they added it just as a comedic subplot. Ruffnut has always been very openly aggresive and decisive about what she wants and shes not afraid to go after it Both Ruffnut and Astrid are in fact. In the first movie you get to see her openly flirting with Hiccup in the See You Tomorrow montage and during the third act. In HTTYD you see her actively pursue Eret.Im conflicted on Astrid. On one hand I think her characterisation is amazing in the second movie. On the other I wish we had seen more of her character outside of the girlfriendlens. Yes she does go after Drago by herself does not need to be rescued by Hiccup and she spends most of the movie away from him but ultimately we see most of her motivations as driven by Hiccup except for the dragon racing at the opening of the movie. She goes after Drago because she believes Hiccup is in danger. Im wondering would she also risk herself and disobey Stoicks orders if it was anyone other than Hiccup that is in danger? Id say yes but we dont get to see that in the film.Ultimately though I think this has to do with more of the fact that HTTYD is about Hiccup. A lot of the characters do things because of Hiccup Stoick the Berk teens Drago and unavoidably Astrid too. So I guess theres not much room to escape from doing things for Hiccup not when the focus of the movie is Hiccup.,httyd,cj1e88r,1,t5_2teon

HTTYD benefits a lot from the world thats been built by the previous movies and TV series.The HTTYD score while awesome pretty much follows the same themes of the previous movie. BHs score is not super inspiring but its not horrible either.Animation in HTTYD is a vast improvement on the first movie as would be expected.  But compared to BH... I dunno. Pretty even.BHs Visual design is all from scratch while HTTYDs builds from its predecessors. They did a bangup job of aging the characters.Storywise I think HTTYD has a good lead on BH.  The emotional impacts are all there good pace and nice resolution.  While BH leaves a few loose ends and feels a bit rushed through.,httyd,cnsilz0,4,t5_2teon

3212408,0,t1_cou4hch,I know! HTTYD was far superior in the writing department and while BH dealt with themes of loss like HTTYD did I dont think they did so nearly as well. The plot spun on the core of Hiccup coming of age and everything in the story is meant to facilitate that with Drago representing the opposite of what Hiccup is supposed to become. And thus the story knew where it was going.I didnt notice any of that kind of nuance in Big Hero . I really wanted to like it San Fransokyo is one beautiful place hats off to environment design but I never felt invested in any of the characters. Kabuki Masks motivation for doing all that stuff felt awkward. It was as if halfway through writing the script someone went Wait! He needs backstory! Ive got it! How about his daughter was a test pilot for an alternate dimension ship! And the evil businessman was in charge of it so he wants revenge!spoilerAnd while the parallel with Hiros lossspoiler was kinda cool it didnt really resonate for me.Hiro and Baymaxs teammates were all static characters. Not always a bad thing but they could have worked in some type of minor character arcs for them. Ruffnuts romantic shenanigans pick up the slack for most of the dragon kids in terms of subplots. Valka has her mostly internal conflict on having left Stoick and Hiccup. Stoick provides a role model for Hiccup the chiefintraining.That ended up being longer than I expected. TldrBH was good but not Oscar good. And in my opinion not even close to HTTYD good.,httyd,couyt53,2,t5_2teon

Think of Hiccup looking longingly at the other teenagers who get to fight dragons and then Gobber drags him back to his real job. That quickly establishes multiple things about Hiccup and his conflict with the world. . Set up the plot and premise. Preferably with the same lines that also established . . Continue the plot. This can be as short as the bridge of a joke another scene a second act or multiple books. Size matters not! Just make sure that it leads to... . A surprising yet logical conclusion. I.e. the end. The story I linked to as proof in my previous comment may be bad as fanfic since it bears little relation to HTTYD itself but you might want to read it as an example of a solidly told very short story. You dont need much time or space to get an idea across. Also Im glad youre putting your story out for feedback. Its scary but its worth it. This is the only way writers get better. I commend you for being a good sport.,httyd,cpvpssp,2,t5_2teon

Your senses easily become saturated and your brain gets easily distracted which doesnt leave much room for critical analysis of the movie during the first viewing. ,httyd,cq0mkza,1,t5_2teon
3600107,0,t1_cq2m094,Good thoughts but I disagree.  Parametric equations are a good way to get nonfunction equations into function form.  e.g. trig functions can be used to make a circle as parametric equations.  A function is a machine that gives exactly one output for each input.Toothlesss curve is not a function of x as you said the vertical line test proves this.  Rather it is a function of t.,httyd,cq2mzh2,1,t5_2teon

Heres something though lets say we genetically engineer the Night Fury. Do we give him his full tail or just half? Something that Hiccup has over his dragon is that Toothless cannot fly without Hiccup. Initially when Toothless thought he could he shook Hiccup off into the water before realizing he could no longer fly and crashing into the water himself.

9230849,0,t3_55nnuq,The shows and shorts kind of damage this theory a bit but I do have a few other issues with this. Gobber is missing his limbs he is a blacksmith maybe because he was good at it but missing his limbs makes it the only suitable job unless fighting as a last resort as he cant run or walk well and likely has balance issues he is likely a very subpar fighter in comparison most disabled veterans in the movie are missing aside from Gobber this means they either likely put themselves in as a last resort and focus on other jobs anyway or then your theory has to apply to every single disabled Viking which wouldnt make much sense tbh Also just because it happens off screen doesnt really mean much  of the fighting until Hiccup attacks the Red Death in the original happened off screen and we only really see a bunch of catapult shots and Stoicks hand to claw combat otherwise.. He goes to fight a Nightmare might want to fix that Whoever says Knock it dead? Thats a very clunky phrasing and Knock em dead is about as ambiguous to his meaning as Go do stuff making it a rather void point. As for his interest in it IDK Gobber is both kind of crazy and unobservant at least until you reach his heart to heart talk stuff Gobber does miss things and says some crazy crap even in the movies and I dont think its envy. His crazy stuff is much more in the shows and shorts Also I have no idea what you mean by that last part it really doesnt make sense to your point or theory.. Gobber might not fear so much as be nervous and it might be just as much for tribe as for Stoick who has been driven crazy since Valka died even before we know about her its obvious from the first council scenes Stoick is mad with bloodlust for the nest Gobber has a rational in multiple approaches it could be both fear and anxious energy who knows. Next part have you ever been in a battle? Even the simplest of ones once you get to the action you will often lose your sense of fear or anxiousness I suspect long time fighters especially get this thus Gobber losing his reservation earlier mixed with knowing its the only way to save the tribe and Stoick makes total sense. And Gobber goes about distracting the beast his way cause he knows the best way to live isnt to directly fight it also how the hell can he fight a  foot creature with one arm and one leg and Stoick is likely still pissed enough when he throws the stick however. In any case Gobber also cant throw shit unlike Stoick and neither of them are willing to run under a giant to get turned into paste.,httyd,d8m2sz1,1,t5_2teon

10958909,0,t1_deaapy7,Well of course I hope that the third film is nothing short of incredible. The Oscars animation award is in some ways a popularity contest so Dreamworks is at an disadvantage. But I have faith that the creative talent working on this movie could produce something that the Academy will have to acknowledge as a masterpiece. The first movie had the misfortune of going against Toy Story . The second movie was a slightly weaker movie and it came extremely close to winning the Oscar. If the stars align and they really take their time which I hope is whats going on right now to make HTTYD the Oscardeserving film it could be it would have a great chance to take both best animated feature and best score. ,httyd,deac0s7,3,t5_2teon
