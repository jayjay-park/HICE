10340905,0,t3_5o079d,The only thing I question on this is the need for Essence Reaver on the AD top.I get it gives you cooldown but is it necessary?,LoLOffMeta,dcg788z,1,t5_378sh
11421555,0,t1_dflvakb,I love support shaco. I go  CDR runes start with ancient coin which puts you at  with mysteries to start. Thats a ton of boxes. You are super mana hungry early so I get a tear as soon as I can and finish eye of the oasis and then get cool down boots to max out at .  Before I finish the tear I get a dark seal. Then finish the rod and get a death cab.  Its hilarious how many boxes you can get out late game with max Cdr and all that ap. Its great against teams that have a lot of divers like lee sin. You use your boxes in lane primarily in bushes and when then dive in on you. If you are ahead you can q and get the box behind them but you need to time it properly so there isnt a new creep wave that will pop it.  Once you hit six you can take turrets pretty quickly and roam. ,LoLOffMeta,dfqme47,1,t5_378sh
