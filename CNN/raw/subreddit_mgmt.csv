1027035,0,t3_25v0bu,In terms of darker songs Cool Song No.  is pretty good. Its named properly.Almost all of their songs are somewhat slow maybe try Song for Dan Treacy or Brian Eno. Unfortunately I havent listening to much Cage the Elephant so I wouldnt know much of what to compare it to.My personal favorites are Of Moons Birds and Monsters and Siberian Breaks. Both pretty slow though but worth a listen if you want to get into the band.,mgmt,chl13ai,6,t5_2rjdi
1509662,0,t1_cj5ibh2,I would but its on a goddamn AIRCRAFT CARRIER. If only. Grimes is doing a DJ set beforehand and shes going to be chilling in that vicinity for a couple days so Ill try and hunt her down and ask her to sneak me in. Thats the plan so far at least. Theres a raffle for a ticket to the event which I entered like  times too.,mgmt,cj5ifit,6,t5_2rjdi
2108965,0,t1_cl79zx9,Obviously nothing like sound quality its just cool for the same reason limited releases etchings on a bside and scratchoff covers are cool the product gets to be superficially more interesting. Obviously people can then say it doesnt increase the listening experience so is a waste of time but buying vinyl isnt just about the listening experience. The huge difference between downloading a song and getting it on record isnt the sound quality its having a physical manifestation of the band or whatever you associate with the band The same reason people keep gig tickets and movie posters. Having novelties in the record then distinguishes it from all your other records so you can see it and think this ones special when you put it on. ,mgmt,cl7w87q,2,t5_2rjdi

8212973,0,t1_d53dufj,I totally understand that it doesnt have to sound s to be pysch. While their earlier stuff took a nod towards the classics they went a few steps further and really modernized a lot of it and basically cherry picked the best parts. To be honest I cant get behind some of the older psych and blues rock psych so its awesome to see them put a new spin on it. Thanks for sharing that Cowley tune. I can totally agree with you on the similarities. I now have youtube auto playing some great jams after that video played out. So thanks for helping me start off my day with a good groove. Seriously cannot wait for whatever they put out next.,mgmt,d546ckh,1,t5_2rjdi
