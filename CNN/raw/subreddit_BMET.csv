That patient files a lawsuit and the court subpoenas the service records for a device that was involved in the incident. If a tech didnt properly service or document for that piece of equipment your company could be on the hook. If your test equipment was out of calibration you could be liable. And yes the customer will try to get the service as cheaply as possible. So you have to keep the customer happy and give them motivation to stay with you.I dont have any insurance so Im not willing to service equipment outside of my job.,BMET,d78jqp6,2,t5_2skyg
10731964,0,t1_ddmprab,The only thing Im hesitant about Vincennes is the location it looks like a tiny village in the middle of nowhere. IUPUI seems better but their outofstate tuitionfees....year! Thats a little scary.It seems mostly community colleges offer these programs but the problem is  being in Canada  I need to go to a school that offers oncampus housing and it seems only a tiny number offers both BMET and housing. ,BMET,ddmx72o,1,t5_2skyg
