5179279,0,t1_cva1q6h,M utooichan Sorry just finished a long shift. Didnt mean to delay things. Please PM me with counterproposals or comments if you think the comments section here is getting too crowded. MThe Empire of Japan would like to submit a new peace proposal and is willing to cease troop movements if China is willing to do the same. If China continues to move troops during ongoing peace negotiations then Japan will be forced to resume combat operations.Japans new Prime Minister recognizes the Manchu heritage of the Qing Emperor. He will therefore not demand the outright annexation of Manchuria. He does however agree to the provision of exclusive economic rights to mining and forestry operations within Manchuria to the Empire of Japan for  years.However the Prime Minister also asks the Chinese Emperor to recognize the situation in Gando Jiandao. It is populated by a large number of ethnic Koreans up to twothirds in many areas who since annexation now enjoy consular jurisdiction. Korea has led to conflict between our Empires before and will again unless the Gando Matter is resolved. The Wanpaoshan incident is an unfortunate example.It is our proposal that the territory of Gando be placed under Japanese administration and the rights of its Chinese citizens will not be infringed should they choose to remain in Gando as subjects of Japan. This means greater stability within the Manchuria region for both powers.The previously proposed agreement involving transfer of control of the Liaodong and Shandong peninsulas to Japan is also agreed to.A map describing our wellintended proposal is included for clarity.transferred land is depicted as salmon pink Manchurian land east of the blue line delineates the exclusive economic zone of Japan.,WorldWarPowers,cvaajyk,1,t5_32dr1

7017494,0,t1_d1bralv,The argument that the only reason Britain joined was because of Belgium is fundamentally false. The invasion of Belgium was a pretext for war but much like in Germany for the reason to attack Russia many felt like if war did not happen the UK would be eclipsed by German industrial might.The UK would have found another way to join if needing to fall back on the policy of maintaining the balance of power in Europe something that was at the forefront of British foreign policy.Britain regarded Germany as its largest rival on the planet. So it linking arms with Greece and Austria Hungary especially in terms of the combined naval might would be a large enough reason for Britain to get defensive. Arguing against that when your navy is like  the size it was in WW at the outbreak would be silly to say the least.Not to mention that Germany already tried to go to war against the United States.

The way that it should be.Raymond Poincar looked around the table seeing the clear agreement in the faces of those present. These men were confident in their position in Europe. They had come out of the greatest war ever with their heads held high and all guns blazing but the threat from across the ocean frightened them. And the status quo needed to be achieved.We shall certainly bring up this up to the other nations of Europe. However there are certain things that you must take into consideration. Italy has just as much right to play on the world stage as you do and you must right the ills that you have between each other. You may find it insulting but it is imperative. Why must everyone else put aside their grievances in the name of unity when the ideologys founder does not.
