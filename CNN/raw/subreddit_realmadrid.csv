Not to mention that the red was definitely warranted. CR should not have touched the other player least of all in the face.If he was banned because of the CR fiasco  this shows that big teams like RM can bully the refereeing commissions into action.

People saying that Suarez wouldnt work well with our wingers and wouldnt score as many if not more goals than Benzema are seriously blind. Suarez is just more talented and a better finisher. If Benzema and Suarez had the same amount of chances Suarez would score more. And the thing is that Benzema gets a RIDICULOUS amount of chances and misses so many.

889874,0,t3_24a8v9,My take on it Reals optimum and preferred set up going on a counter has two include two flanking players ie CR Bale Di maria ...  With  or  forwards in the middle for a link upspace and a deep lying playmaker modric or dictator alonso to make either a brilliant pass or a smart pass and not lose possession and still have momentum going forward. Sure it looks simple but it takes a few tries before world class players like these execute all the right passes at the right times to succeed. Then again if you do that for any tactic it would work but counter attacking football is eye candy for me and anyone who says otherwise needs to get their head checked. ,realmadrid,ch5fkwz,1,t5_2rr0e

Morata needs prominence in an other club but that isnt the problem.The problem is that Morata has the desire to be a target manstriker. He wont be as long as he is next Cris and Bale.

Wed lose DiMa who could either rotate with Bale on the right or with Modric beside Alonso.. but it feels like Isco could really become one of the all time Madrid greats if he got more playing time.He played like a storm of fire and cleats in the preseason and it was miraculous to behold just how good this kid is. Makes selling Ozil a bit of a mistake but Isco would be so much better there in the long term. Plus we get to return to a formation the players know and have mastered under Mou.

At half time the most we were regretting was Benzs big touch. We had Atleti backed in a corner and their attack was completely sterile for a solid chunk of the first half. Obviously taking away two integral components from last year will take time to mend but it has been shown that the system can work and the players can gel to something truly spectacular.

Last season Benz was important because he was the fixed point up front that linked up BBC. Now were starting to play with  roaming forwards and no real fixed points. All  are required to have the same role. Ronaldo has been thriving and playmaking way more. He has a much higher key pass average then Bale and Benz and has been linking up our midfield and forwards alongside James. Bale hasnt been playing as well as Ronaldo but he has been scoring.

Reus is extremely versatile and so he could probably play James current role alongside the front  of course with Carlos magic touch that is.The reality is that we will have to sign a better striker next summer as Im . sure Chicharito wont be signed and so that leaves Bale Ronaldo Benzema and Jese for the front  positions with James and Isco able to cover if need be. We WILL sign a higher caliber forward the question is will it be a Reus or something in between?One thing is for sure and that is we should expect a galactico signing every summer and if we had to choose one Id rather sign Pogba. ,realmadrid,cmvcuki,1,t5_2rr0e

All the clubs are swimming in debts and even thought Cruzeiro is probably the one in the best financial position right now theres still some bills to pay. Also its kinda hard to find good players IN Brazil. You either get a kid who have potentil and hope that he succeeds or you go after some player that is already in his s and again hope that it works or you go get players in Argentina Chile Uruguay etc. And pray to the heavens that he is as good as Youtube says he is.The REALLY good players they are expensive. And when you are not a team who gets the most money from TV when you are not the team with most fans it gets hard to have enough money to pay all the expensive players.The reason Cruzeiro succeed for two straight seasons is that we got players that looked like they had big potential and they lived up to their expectations Everton Ribeiro Ricardo Goulart Lucas Silva etc.Now that everybody saw how good they are we cant keep them because the money they offer them is way more that we can pay. ,realmadrid,cnzcqr1,1,t5_2rr0e

3866355,0,t3_34pl1z,I will copy what I wrote the last time this came upgt In my opinion Ronaldo just doesnt practice them as much anymore.gt I speak from my own expierence here. I always was keen to know how players exactly shoot the ball. Ronaldo used to always shoot the ball with top spin. I tried to master that technique and after some months was able to execute somewhat decently like  in  shots with this technique. Because its so incredibly hard to master you have to train them literally every day to be any consistent with them.gt And here comes my observation which leads to my earlier conclusion. If you try this technique and fail most of the time the ball will get side spin instead of top spin. Thats because you have to hit the ball and follow through in a very specific way to achieve top spin any slight misplacement will give it the wrong spin  i.e. side spin. And I noticed in many of CRs last freekicks that the ball also got sidespin but on some freekicks it has the usual top spin. Which just shows me that Ronaldo still tries to do the same technique but cant execute it consistantly. Probably because he doesnt practice enough anymore.gt Maybe his focus in training has gone elsewhere which is reasonable I guess because freekicks arent the most important part of the game. But then he should let others take them but as it stands he will still take them because he is after all Ronaldo.gt Another option for him would be to abandon his trademark technique and just revert to the traditional side spin technique most players use. Its much more easy to use I think anyone can hit the ball with side spin you literally just have to hit it with the side of your foot. To be accurate with it is obviously much harder but it would at least remove his inconsistency with his technique in the first place and he could focus on the accuracy,realmadrid,cqwzy9q,9,t5_2rr0e

3888448,0,t1_cqzig1v,I never said Illarramendi is bad. I just think Lucas Silva will perform better and he deserves a chance to play. Illarramendi got chances and was consistently averagebelow average not really starting quality.,realmadrid,cqzim5s,2,t5_2rr0e
3890942,0,t3_350c4f,Agree completely with the Ramos part. Having Ramos in the midfield worked against Atletico because we needed a physical destroyer in the midfield who can go head to head against Atleticos physicalultra defensive style of playing. Against goodelite teams that also go strong in the attack ex. SevillaJuventus our midfield wont be as effective because of Ramos lack of technical ability and our defence is in shambles because Ramos is our leader in the back. Ideally Modric should start but he wont be available and Illarramendi doesnt contribute that much to our attack. I would say revert back to the  with IscoJamesKroos and RonaldoChicharitoBale. Lucas Silva is talented but Im not sure if we can trust him in a big match yet. Chicharito is on a hot streak right now and should continue to start.One thing you forgot to mention is Carvajals dip in form. Marcelo is getting the bulk of the criticisms but Carvajal has been just as bad. The past few matches almost everyone is getting past him with ease and then he committed the dumb penalty that gave Juventus the win. I really hope that we dont start Arbeloa in the semifinal even though he has been pretty good the last few matches but Carvajal has been a big liability as well. Our CBs cant cover everything both fullbacks need to improve ASAP or we wont last against Juventus. ,realmadrid,cqzsv0e,8,t5_2rr0e

4057395,0,t3_36wtxs,I really want a striker. Now with strikers you can go two ways The pacy ill do everything my self kinda striker and the target man such as Karim Benzema. I would LOOOOVE a pacy striker to stop us from crossing the ball in time and time again.. Buuuut someone like Jackson Martinez will also do. Now what do Jackson and Benz have in common... well.. basically everything buuut Jackson is better in the air so going for crosses might work when we have him in the team sheet. As for another option I think we desperately need a pure defensive mid someone like Matic probably never going to happen how about Kondogbia? Heard a lot of buzz about him but ive only seen our matches against Monaco so I cannot judge. As a side note I really REALLY REALLY hope we STOP signing big name superstars. I mean someone will start pointing that this doesnt always go well Illara but giving players a chance to fight for the shirt makes them play better.

5475009,0,t3_3q1ibh,Fun game in a different way. First half was a nice clean game where we took the lead and comfortably kept it the whole way. Second half things took a strange turn with the referee going trigger happy with booking Celta players simultaneously gotta admit it was ridiculous and with the red card its like they suddenly became much more dangerous. Nolito with that fantastic goal that even Navas couldnt have saved on his best day made me nervous for the rest of the game but it was all worth it to strike a sword to their heart in the final moments with Marcelo sealing the deal! Much props to Celta for truly bringing it I knew this was gonna be a tough game but the win is all ours and its nice to see the front line working effectively for a change even though we still miss too many chances.Navas is the fucking man can always depend on him to make some great saves that keeps us on top. Will be great if Barcelona somehow drop points tomorrow against Eibar then the lead will be all ours! which it shouldnt have been by now if not for the stupid point dropping,realmadrid,cwbhf4h,1,t5_2rr0e

5737331,0,t3_3tq1fh,Those who are criticizing Kroos for being invisible throughout the game dont understand that Kroos plays best when he is controlling the midfield and we have possession. Benitez played him so that we would have more possession but he had no one to pass to cause there was no midfield and we were playing very rushed and disorganized.Carvajal should have started he would have handled neymar and alba much better than Danilo did. Danilo wasnt even playing rightback Varane was covering for him the whole game. I also dont understand why james was taken out he was the only person with a shot on target and he was playing well. Isco could have come for Kroos who could not do anything because of the midfield.Bravo did great to stop a few efforts from Ronaldo but they wouldnt have really made a difference. Barcas defense midfield and offense were much better than ours. The reason they won the game was because of their pressing they didnt allow us to have possession. When we pressed it was disorganized and opened up space for them to get in behind and create chances. This game was painful to watch.

6353681,1,t3_42lwig,Actually its a system thing. Barca wins because when you dont have as much talent as Real Madrid you can talk to your players and ground them really good. Their base with Busquets Alba Sergi Roberto Munir Vidal Bartra and even a Rakitic understand well their role and youll never know or even hear about controversy for being in the starting lineup or not they accept their role and thats it discussion ends. In our team is different theres a bunch of talent press media is polluting day in day out the environment in Madrid and players start to go off their places thats when inestability comes and they think that their persona  comes before the club the victories the team. In the end its all about a system you set up a gameplay for the first team Castilla and at least  more categories and work with that once you do this players understand theres a system they will come to fullfill a role and thats it. Not everyone can be cracks or the best in the world in their position they play when they can and are fit and they push all at the same time for the same goal. That being said I really wish this can be done by Zizou you can see theres a change in the environment and I believe Zizou is a smart guy to carry this responsability. Other than that I actually liked the second part of the game we deserved more and all people know it. In the end you could also tell the hate level they have for us in Sevilla was plausible their players ran like there was no tomorow and the crowd were all over it through the whole game. ,realmadrid,czbud6p,2,t5_2rr0e

At least a couple of times yesterday his bald spot was revealed. I must say that is one unfortunate bald spot. Its big and in the most unsightly place. His hair seems to be healthy everywhere else.  All this time I wondered why Bale was growing his hair out when he seems to be so uncomfortable with it. Hes always fixing it and it seems that it annoys him. Its not like he can just Pirlo it and run with it. I hate that he has to live and deal with that. There is no way that he can effectively hide without it protruding ever once in a while. It draws attention to him in a negative way. And yeah that is a bit classless from goal.com but its not like theyre doing it to spite us.

7468417,0,t3_4hn69z,We have options.. Use Ramos at DM. Yes Ramos passing is inconsistent but as far as defence goes there wont be a massive dropoff between him and Casemiro and that is the most important part as we cannot let Man City score an away goal.. Go back to the  formation that Carlo used back in that massive win streak something like JamesKroosModricIsco with Ronaldo and Bale in front. Although James and Isco arent close to what they were last season this could be a decent formation to go with since both James and Isco have been better as of late albeit against inferior opponents but still. And this formation has seen success before  Barcelona at home.. Go back to the ModricKroosJames midfield or replace James with Isco doesnt really matter. I dont want to see Kroos back at DM but its not like we have literally lost all the games with Kroos at DM. Having Kroos at DM would mean our defence would be extremely vulnerable on counterattacks but it would also mean much better possession and attacks. We just need to outscore them hard which is still difficult.If I were Zidane I would go with the first option. People only remember the second leg against Juventus where Ramos was just disastrous but in other games where Ramos started as a DM it really wasnt that bad. Plus even if Ramos does play poor he can bring in similar physicality into the midfield like Casemiro does. We will see what happens.,realmadrid,d2r433y,4,t5_2rr0e

You just twisted the argument into we never wanted pogba. Which true as it may be more or less proves their point. Madrid didnt target pogba and its likely because theyd never pay what united paid. You can say he doesnt fit but players better than Kroos and Modric have been moved on to make room for galacticos see di maria.

9024984,0,t3_53vok5,Being a CM isnt just about tacklesdefense. If working hard on tracking back was all it took then there was no reason why James couldnt even take the super sub midfielder spot from Isco last season.There are certain strengths and skills that a typical CM need. For players like Kroos they need to be excellent consistent passers at all ranges and at the same time read the game and move the ball around. They are the backbone of possession and the reason why we looked so lost against Espanyol last week before Kroos came on. For BB players like Modric and Isco they need excellent dribbling skills to absorb pressure and move the ball up all at the same time working hard on defence hence the term BB. Modric is probably even more than a normal BB considering that he could also do a bit of what Kroos does and recycle possession which is why hes arguably the best midfielder in the world right now.James iswas a  and it seems like hes also trying to transition to a CM like Isco did which is good for him. s are dying in modern football by also tracking back hard. Its a good start but there are still some weakness in James game before fully transitioning mainly handling heavy pressing. He will not become a proper CM until he can improve his dribbling even more or recycle the ball like ModricKroos can under heavy pressure.,realmadrid,d7wntql,14,t5_2rr0e

Marcelo is the main culprit on that goal for having lost the ball so cheaply.  We need to get over this habit of relaxing and letting teams back in matches.

Also his distribution is still subpar compared to De Gea which really hurts our possession play and you can tell that by watching the likes of Ramos and Varane dribbling their way out of pressure instead of trusting in Navas with a backpass. He still has time to get back to his past season form and his level right now is even good enough but i honestly feel like De Gea or even Cuortois would be a definite upgrade on Keylor. ,realmadrid,ddtnkhp,-1,t5_2rr0e
