819,0,t1_ceeg6nm,Like SirWalterScott said its more about the ability to use copyrighted material to make new works derivative usage than to enjoy the media itself. To put it on a narrower scale if youre familiar with sampling from music think about thisRock me Amadeus from the s wouldnt exist if Mozart wasnt public domain.    Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are dead wouldnt exist if Shakespeare wasnt public domain.  Not to mention a whole host of films based on his plays.   A lot of art would be mouldering away if people werent allowed to restore it due to restricted usage. This doesnt just go for paintings it applies to things like the Acropolis in Athens and the recently restored cut of The Wickerman the original was lost for awhile.    Same with the recently rediscovered noir film Blast of Silence. If some germans hadnt dug up old prints of it in the late s and restored them I and many other people never wouldve seen it! The article itself has some more good examples but it basically boils down to that art is never created in a vacuum. Limiting our ability to use and reuse art greatly reduces our ability to produce new art and also means that a whole slew of works that could be saved and enjoyed adding to our cultural tapestry instead just quietly rots away.,books,ceej5lc,1,t5_2qh4i
1118,0,t1_ceehz9x,Calm down. You seem to have completely missed the part where I said I dont think classics should be rewritten but that as adults aware of the historical context in which they were written we can still enjoy them by taking that into account. Discussing the different values of the past compared to today and the shortcomings of adventure literature in general does not equal a personal attack on Tolkein. I dont think old stories should be whitewashed. And it certainly wasnt Tolkeins responsibility to be socially ahead of his times. But its also silly to expect that modern readers are all going to what... not notice the sometimes quite jarring outdated morals? Its quite possible to enjoy a work a lot and also analyze the bits where WOW it does not hold up to todays society and the bits where isnt it fascinating if you think about the role of horses in WWI why horses were so prominent in his mind. Though it also shouldnt come as a surprise that as a work of fiction the outdated morals may just make it flat out unenjoyable as entertainment to some modern readers.,books,ceekdkx,2,t5_2qh4i

Actually the answer to that is probably because McCarthy wanted some way to justify cannibals.  He couldnt do that if there were any living thing for humans to eat.  So he adapted magic in order to get his cannibalsThe problem is that he doesnt begin to sell any of this.  He offers no possible explanation as to how such a world may have come to be.  This is likely because there is no valid scientific explanation for his irrational construct. The Roads world is as much one of magic as Harry Potter but McCarthy never admits this.

68167,0,t1_cem0esl,She deserved the profits from the first thirty years of her wild continuing popularity and relevance. Thats a fantastic reward for any artist and most never achieve even half that. The last twentyfour years have been an excess. Copyright in America is only established to promote the useful arts for the sake of the public. Its not an endless meal ticket that locks up beloved works for twice the natural lifetime of people who already live to a ripe of old age. Her lawyers an asshole though. Obviously if Disneys greedy retroactive extensions are giving undeserved money to anyone the artist is the least undeserving recipient and swindling old ladies out of anything is criminal. gt Tell me why copyright limitations are good for living authors  because Id like to know why you feel that a legitimate argument? Fixed limits simplify everything. All you need to know before publishing a derivative work or otherwise using a work without permissions is the publication date. Theres no rats nest of red tape trying to figure out who authored a movie or a song. Furthermore it helps ensure the public domain is relevant to the public as its supposed to be. If Sir Paul McCartney lives to be  then three whole generations of fans may have grown to maturity before The Beatles discography becomes theirs to legally however they like. How many novels from  are well past relevance by now? How many young adults from the s and s died natural deaths without being allowed to freely use and enjoy those briefly popular works they way they can use Shakespeare or Peter Pan? Remember that copyrights about more than just money. Its for our benefit as well as artists and the vast majority of works will make the vast majority of their profits in just a few years anyway.I turn the question to you why are copyright limitations good for forty fifty or sixty years after a works publication? Why should individuals whove already made their fortunes from the publics enjoyment be allowed to control that enjoyment until they finally kick the bucket?,books,cem6v0f,1,t5_2qh4i

From the semidarkness of fears and doubts of now ignorant generations the Dinosaurs continued to extend their necks to raise their taloned hoofs and when the last shadow of their image had been erased their name went on superimposed on all meanings perpetuating their presence in relations among living beings.

87517,0,t3_1v3eg6,It could be how you read them.  Youre not giving us much context but here you go.  Ive noticed that people who read quickly forget texts after long periods.  They remember long enough to do well in a class or for a research topic but they forget years later when the booksubject comes up again.  Some people train their memories this way.  Ive noticed that my friends in America are mixed in this.  Those who do extremely well in a class without trying some might say tend to have this issue.  But those who work hard in a class and struggle a bit end up remembering more details.  One of my England friends remembers everything he read but lacks enthusiasm for anything other than what hes interested in.It boils down to how we were trained to read.  If you dont read often then reading will become more difficult.  If you read too fast or think about random things like those noodles you ate the other night and whether or not that green stuff in the powder was mold and if youll get a super power from being poisoned and if you should risk eating more dangerously to become a superhero which is ridiculous but you make an effort to drink tea with the leaves on the bottom just in case that afternoon then you might have to train yourself to focus on the text more.

The more more books you read the more baggage you have and when you have acquired enough knowledge you will start to notice the certain patterns like literary devices and be able to compare different books and authors to each other and understand how and why they wrote what they wrote.For example I noticed how sometimes the name of the character foreshadows its function or is related to its traits so now Im more attentive of possible meanings in their names. Obvious example would be CandideAlso know more about the life of the author and the context in which the novel was written.

I experienced it too I was even that kid in class who read  while the teacher was talking and got bad grades for it. When I was asked to read and then analyze a book then answer questions and find the meaning in the book that I already knew and felt describing it felt like it ruined the meaning of the book.Its kinda like a good joke that everyone gets but when you try to explain it it gets less funny.,books,ceqdfx5,4,t5_2qh4i

Making it a useful example or tool in teaching these concepts to students.  That said if someone is not a confirmed reader making them read this book may turn them off of literature for life.

105359,0,t1_ceqdrnh,Im  some of my close family have lived in soviet block countries. I understand that having not lived through the Cold War I lack the emotional and personal connection that you might but I do have a fairly good academic grasp of the era. I wasnt saying the Soviet Union was small thatd make me an idiot. Im saying that the Soviet Union didnt last very long and that the era of bloodshed under Stalin was even shorter though undoubtedly brutal and tragic. Violence and oppression like that cannot be sustained in a large culturally diverse society. The DPRK can control its people so effectively because they are a largely homogenous and isolated society.One of the major points in  is the eternal war and eternal subjugation. The point that I am trying to make is that EXTENDED subjugation only really occurs in smaller nations. China is having its period of reform now Russia had its in the s.

106213,0,t1_ceqcalq,However a lot of students these days dismiss literature classes as symbol hunting when thats not the focus of teaching literature. No not everything in the book is a symbol for some profound thing but certainly a great book is great because it speaks to something in the time it was written or completely characterizes the time it was written in. And tapping into those conversations if you view art as a conversation you start to understand significance in context a LOT better gives you an understanding of the literary traditions of a society from the past to the present and also greatly strengthens your ability to understand the importance of context a universally important tool required for critical thinking. Its a shame when a teacher or professor reduces a great text to symbol hunting but its also sad to see students think thats all there is to great literature. You may never be able to sit down with a text like Paradise Lost or Inferno and read it solely for pleasure but if youve had a solid opportunity to analyze it in a classroom environment you should be able to think holy shit this book must have been a big deal.,books,ceqiv44,4,t5_2qh4i

Its important though to keep in mind that literature is not a Rorschach test and there are interpretations that go too far or not far enough.  A good teacher will discuss them anyway pointing out flaws and alternatives and recognize where that interpretation comes from.  Above all to learn this kind of analysis you have be allowed if not outright encouraged to be offbase sometimes.  The defining trait of any analysis is evidence and no interpretation for which you can provide good evidence should be dismissed out of hand.  There is no perfectly right analysis but there are sensible ones.  There is no entirely wrong analysis but there are indefensible ones.  The very heart of analysis is constructive criticism in which both the construction and the criticism are taken seriously and done respectfully so that everyone can arrive at a broader deeper understanding of the work and its place in the world.,books,cer65mz,1,t5_2qh4i

Stop using hive groupthink and look at what Atlas Shrugged was acually promoting as the ideal hero was in effect an analogy of the ideal political system.Ayn Rand emigrated from Russia and its communist  everyone must share doctrine into America and its capitalistic  You get what you earn doctrine. She examined what would happen to the extremes in an attempt to prove to the World the American system was better than the Russian system but to also show how a capitalistic government could also become bad for all.The fact she wrote about a sexualized smart powerful woman who didnt take no for an answer in the s not using or making any excuses for how she lived her life means it was somewhat hated by conservatives then as much as liberals now hate it by the false analogy she wanted all oldyoungsick people to die because they cant provide for themselves.No matter what job you do do it well because there is honor in that. The more you look out for your own interests the byproduct was that by far society as a whole and individuals in general will ultimately improve for all peoples from the lowest to the highest. Even though communism and lots and lots of government was suppost to protect the weakest people by sharing all equally that didnt or dosent work so individualismcapitalism and less government is inherently and inevitably better for all poor and sick and weak and hard workers and slackers included.If you hate capitalism and love communism great at least you now know why you should have hated that book. But if a capitalistic government has grown too powerful andor disfunctionable taken over by professional politicians and red tape and moneyed interests and is in reality hurting those weakest of individuals under its care dont be afraid to blow the whole thing up and start over something many rich conservatives and businesses and powerful politicians and antianarchists would hate as well if they fully understood.,books,cerkiuc,0,t5_2qh4i

124141,0,t1_cesh2lz,In the beginning there was Eru. He is God in the LOTR universe. He created the Ainur or Holy Ones and they were the primordial spirits that helped him create Arda through their music. When Arda was done a portion of the Ainur descended to Arda to act as stewards the mightiest of these were called the Valar of which Melkor was one and accompanying them were lesser spirits that were called Maiar. So AinurValarMaiar are basically LOTR angels and the distinct groups are kind of like the choirs of angels archangels seraphim thrones powers principalities etc.When a Maiar is killed it doesnt really die which in LOTR means your soul travels to the halls of the Vala Mandos and stayed there but its being is unhoused from its body you see this happen with Sauron when hes first defeated by the Last Alliance and its mirrored in his servants the Nazgul when theyre beaten back by the flood. They are basically resigned to wander in a weakened and ineffectual state until they can either regenerate a body or have their patron Vala restore them. So when Gandalf died he turned back into a spirit went home to his boss got a new body and came back to MiddleEarth. The Balrog meanwhile probably remained unhoused and powerless forever after since Melkor was locked out of the world at the time and so wasnt really available to restore its body.As far as power levels go its worth considering that Gandalf and the Fellowship reached the Bridge of KazhadDum on January   TA and Gandalf didnt kill the Balrog until January . He fought the Balrog for  days AND WON. Also Gandalf is frequently referred to as among the wisest of the Maiar and he was one of the Maia belonging to the King and Queen of the Valar. Hes got an impressive resume and if it werent for the Ring he probably was more than a match for Sauron himself.That is assuming Gandalf was even interested in being anybodys match he was always way too compassionate and goodnatured to sink to that sort of thinking.,books,ceskghj,6,t5_2qh4i

125052,0,t1_cesnhjd,The case of Fingolfin fighting Melkor was meant not to depreciate Morgoth but to prove the point that it was nevertheless possible to harm his physical form despite the still incomprehensible spiritual power he held at the time. I do acknowledge however that after escape from Aman IIRC Morgoth was bound to that physical form unable to take any other because of how much power he lost but still he was able to command fear into all his underlings and keep corrupting the world. To me its a clear sign that the spiritual and material realms in Arda are made of something quite different the physical realm being much limited compared to everything else. if a being so many orders of magnitude more powerful worshipped by his underlings as a deity can be matched  if unevenly and for a brief moment  by a mortal being  then that must count for something.  After all it wasnt just Fingolfin clinging for his life in desperation. Despite the confrontation most likely looking something like this Fingolfin managed to escape Morgoths blows and even wound him time after time until he finally succumbed but not before the rest of the Noldor came at which point Morgoth hid back in his fortress.For some reason I really like this depiction ,books,ceso75o,2,t5_2qh4i

Catch is a labyrinth of characters and events interwoven in a horribly confused timeline so you cant approach it like a novel. You have to treat each chapter like a separate entity.

164343,0,t1_cex4tok,gt So what were really talking about is at least  for every seat in the school with frequent replacements. Even a small liberal arts college will generally have to have space to accommodate several thousand students at once so were talking about an outlay of  every few yearsAnd that cost is distributed amongst thousands of students.  Yes a  charge looks scary when its multiplied by the entire student body but when you divide the cost up among said body it comes back to being  if not less because not every charger is going to be stolen or replaced.Heck if youre that concerned about the cost then just charge each student for using a school provided charger.  It would allow use of such things for emergencies and would urge students to not rely on it.gt But hey! Why are we even debating this?Because you made providing a rather cheap modern utility as if it was unfeasible and it was the problem you were addressing at the time.gt And in the second place as nearly everyone in this thread has realized the simplest and probably best solution to the charger problem is to simply throw responsibility back onto the student.You do know that I said as much when I said Regardless even without those chargers its still the students responsibility to have their materials prepared. right?,books,cex5g81,3,t5_2qh4i

I would like to know the same thing about the Six Duchies and the former Elderling nationscities.I would also like to know if your planning on taking up another story from the Realm of the Elderlings and if you are where in that world it would take place.Thank you for all of your books they are amazingly precious to me.,books,cexc1hp,4,t5_2qh4i
167289,0,t3_1vusqa,So happy you asked although my explanation will probably not settle your mind! This is text was intended to read more as a poem than a novel and was written in  pretty fucking shocking even considering todays standards imagine peoples response back then!George Bataille is considered a surrealist writer perhaps obvious but would explain some of the major themes happening within the text. The surrealist movement actually started in literature I highly suggest some research in Andre Bretn the man who wrote the Surrealist Manifesto.Surrealist writers spend a great deal exploring eroticism especially in sexual taboos in attempt to deconstruct whats socially acceptable. In the case of Story of the Eye we see incest sex with children orgies beastiality necrophilia and of course the climax scene involving murder and a priest. One particular theme I found was the connection between violence and sex that they are interchangeable. From the most obvious example the priest last breath is while he is orgasming linking sexual climax to death the french idiom for orgasm is little death. Other acts of violence like watching the bullfights stirs the same erratic behavior in the character Simone she begins to masturbate.Another take on this text is its critique of the idle rich or the bourgeois. The complacency of Simones mother as she catches her with the narrator doing crazy sexual stuff in the house and lets it continue. Also take note of the orgy scene that happens at the beginning of the story with all the kids where are the parents? The narrator even mentions his parents didnt even bother showing up the evening even when the cops are called. They also have help from a wealthy Englishman to flee the country who eventually watch them kill the priest. If this does not suffice I apologize!,books,cexhk8i,2,t5_2qh4i

Hope I can clear up.The kindle fire is indeed a tablet as compared to an eReader the kindle fire as well as the fire HD has an LCD or something similar like an AMOLED screen the pixel desnsity means the fire will be a decent quality but not like p. Native software for the kindle fires is actually android would you believe with a nice thick user friendly skin thrown over the top as a tablet theyre good and can even be rooted to run a normal standalone version of android.As mentioned yes theyre is a fair few drawbacks I see them im a retail outlet with great big bright lights so can compare it to a really sunny day the glare is really horrible. Imagine using your phone in bright sunlight on the lowest screen brightness really not great primarily the design for the fire is a tablet you can play the likes of angry birds and watch videos the thrown in extra is the ability to read books if you look at them side by side. The battry life is also appauling compared with the kindle paperwhite and other models. As the fore IS indeed a tablet youre probably looking at an  hour battery life sadly.Honestly if I was you Id look at the kindle paperwhite for reading during the day in the park and every day use the fire is a good midrange tablet but for magazines youre really going to want to either pick up a cheapish tabley with an IPS or AMOLED screen or hope that youve got a smartphone that runs android that has the play magazine app.As for an eReader with magazine access I really think youll struggle I dont currently know of an eReader with the very much desired eInk screen having the ability to read magazines on certainly not here in the UK maybs in japan or china is anothwr story Sorry if this wasnt what you were hoping to hear but hopefully youre now a little wiser on not choosing the kindle fire as they are basically a tablet with the kindle name attached.Hope this helps you! ,books,cf0h50a,1,t5_2qh4i

There is something so powerful about the final bits of the story and then His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead. The way that it invokes an image of snow blanketing the ground that is not only walked upon by the living but also where the dead rest.

348218,0,t1_cfguc0n,When I said that referring to chemical processes is a copout what I meant was that the origin of something does not describe the thing itself. Human consciousness is not a series of chemical processes it is derived from a series of chemical processes. Theres an excellent book by neuroscientist David Eagleman called Incognito a general popsci explanation of neuroscience as it is today and its implications with a chapter which deals with this the body of neuroscience does not claim to know what consciousness is beyond saying that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain just as flight is an emergent property of a plane. To try and isolate flight  dissect it weigh it  would be impossible because flight transcends physicality. Neuroscience is in fact one of the sciences which I consider to have progressed beyond dogmatic newtonian physic by admitting that unknowable transcendence the ineffable is an essential scientific property although some neuroscientists disagree.I also want to make it clear that these are not preconceived notions and I am not using evidence adhoc. I was not raised in a particular faith and up until recently I was a very strong sceptic of religion metaphysics and spirituality. These are conclusions Ive come to after reading a lot about quantum mechanics mythology and the philosophy of religion reading books written by respected authors by the way not the selfhelp style books of Deepak Chopra whom Ive never read. This is also why I respect your position so much because its one Ive shared for most of my life and I believe that scepticism is a valid road to socalled enlightenment if only you can be sceptical and not subscribe to scepticism as a school.On quantum physics Ostensibly it seems to me that youre rejecting my assertion that quantum physics says something about transcendence and the universal nature of consciousness without listening to what I have to say. Maybe Im wrong and you can provide an explanation and I dont mean that as a rhetorical insult but so far youve disagreed wholly with the way Im arguing and said nothing to disagree with what Im saying. So what exactly is it about quantum physics Ive misunderstood and what particular nuance of the theory of relativity have I missed which tells us that the universe is objectively existential rather than subjectively independent rather than relative? I have to admit that these questions are somewhat rhetorical but if you do have some information which disagrees with my assertion that these sciences assert and provide evidence for the conclusion that consciousness is essential to the universe I would like to hear it.,books,cfguzy9,1,t5_2qh4i

Some content is by its nature verbose and streamofconsciousnesslike analysis is especially so I wasnt constructing an argument for something where you might expect me to cherry pick the best analytical observations I was having a thorough look at something hopefully in a way that would let someone else follow along.In fact the op had litterally said the quote was hard to understand. By writing something really verbose about it I hopefully am able to make sure there isnt any subtext of note going on.

362236,0,t1_cfi7gz5,Vol. Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec In memoriam Jeffrey . Official household fly much missed. He did not buzz and he always washed his hands.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec The thoughts of Polka the sleeping ladybird Bloody cold up here. Draught goes right up me carapace. Wheres that fly gone? I fancied him.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Dreams of the sleeping Polka Being polished and buffed at the fingernail salon  Nice boy with big eyes. That fly was well fit Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Nightmare for Polka Dreamed I woke up and found all me spots had fallen off. I was well shamed up. I had to go and be a nun.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Polka Will he still love me if I ent got spots? Whatm I gonna do? I cant bear it. I blame the fingernail place. Ent going there again.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey lives! He flew outside by mistake stopped for some refreshment and tasted dung for the first time. It was the call of the wild.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey the fly is torn. One way a field full of dung to feed his new habit the other Polka the ladybird whimpering in her sleep.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey found Polka sobbing. All me spots have gone! No theyre all there. How many? He took some time. More than six he said.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey the fly watching over the happily sleeping Polka hears distant snatches of music. Its the SSO the Silverfish Symphony Orchestra.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec The SSO are rehearsing Rach. Conc. No. with the great wasppianist Ada Vespucci. The trouble is that at every ff she emits a loud buzz.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec And she doesnt know shes doing it. Who will tell her? The conductor has tried three times and each time hes fainted clean away.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec But silverfish faint very easily. The viola section of the SSO faints en bloc when they turn a page in the score and see an accidental.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec A deputation from the SSO is coming to ask Jeffrey to speak to Mme Vespucci the wasppianist about her buzzing as she plays Rachmaninov.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey the fly who walks on the wild side has no idea what these silverfish are asking him to do. A lady wasp? A piano? But hell do it. Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Frankly the silverfish have bitten off more than they can chew with Rachmaninov. But the chance to play with Mme Vespucci! Irresistible!Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey Why do you buzz when you play? Mme Vespucci To drown the hideous squeak from the brass section. Mon Dieu! Quel horreur!Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec The embouchure is hard for silverfish. The principal trombones instrument is full of dead colleagues who blew themselves right inside it.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey who cant buzz himself and cant remember what the silverfish asked him to do to Mme Vespucci Will you teach me to buzz?Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec It turns out that Jeffrey hasnt got the equipment to buzz with. In a frenzy of despair he blunders out in the dark to score some dung.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Rehearsals are going badly. Mme V is buzzing like a chainsaw half the orchestra is dead the conductor is trying to hide behind his baton.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey after a night of debauchery clings to the faint warmth coming through the window from the underparts of the sleeping Polka.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Half dead Jeffrey fell off the window just missed the drain went to sleep and was revived by Mme V and the SSO slaughtering Rachmaninov.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec It sounded like the very voice of heaven as with faint cries of terror it came buzzing squeaking and scraping up through the drainpipe.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec The night was transfigured. Jeffrey resolved to give up dung for ever live on music and love and be a better purer fly.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffreys going cold turkey on the dung and everyones suffering. He even snapped at Mme V as she left for the station in her pillbox hat.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey is sleeping it off. Meanwhile Sviatoslav the conductor of the Silverfish Symphony Orchestra is gathering his courage ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  to think about the Rachmaninov disaster.  dead and Mme V does not yet know that her cheque will bounce. But onward and upward!Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Next some British light music perhaps. Eric Coates? Robert Farnon? Ronald Binge? Surely they could manage Sailing By without danger.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Not much to report flywise. The SSO has bought a new harp using the same account with which they paid Mme V so they might not have it ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  for long. But noone can play it. When someone plucks a string it twangs and sends them flying into the distance. Several lost already.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Waves of seasickness overcome the SSO as they rehearse Sailing By. Three violinists are victims of hysterical drowning. Jeffrey sleeps on.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey woke up remembering nothing except his boundless love for Polka and his admiration for the sublime music of the silverfish.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec As they scraped whimpered and vomited their way through Sailing By two enormous tears rolled down his face. Could anything be lovelier?Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey wants the SSO to play the Siegfried Idyll to wake Polka. Sviatoslav hoping that Jeffrey wont be able to tell the difference ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  decides to rehearse Binges Elizabethan Serenade instead. Its worked before. Itll keep the death toll down too. Jeffrey loves it.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Scandal! Sviatoslav in the middle of conducting the SSO in Elizabethan Serenade drops the baton and flees. Two wasps have appeared ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  and Sviatoslav taking them for friends of Mme V scarpered at once. Not a bit of it! The wasps found Jeffrey in tears and said ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  Whats this music then?The Siegfried Idyll! sobbed Jeffrey.Is that what you think? Weve been after this rascal for months ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Sviatoslav has been defrauding the musical public for some time. Only last week he conducted Robert Farnons Westminster Waltz ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  and passed it off as Tchaikovsky.But who are you? said Jeffrey.The Performing Rights Society said the wasp. And were armed.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Sviatoslav the silverfish is on the run from the guntoting agents of the Performing Rights Society. Where can he hide? Jeffrey! Help!Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey I paid you to play Wagner and you played Binge. Why should I help you?Sviatoslav Ive learned my lesson! Ill never do it again!Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey Well all right Sviatoslav Help! Theyre coming!Wasp Whats that youre sitting on?Jeffrey A cushion. A dead cushion.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Wasp Looks like a live musician to me. Jeffrey No hes dead really. And I wanted Binge all the time. Honest. Not Wagner at all.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Wasp Looks like a live musician to me. Jeffrey No hes dead really. And I wanted Binge all the time. Honest. Not Wagner at all.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Jeffrey struggling up But this is anarchy! Just for a little Binge  Wasp blowing smoke off muzzle of gun The PRS always gets its man.Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec To calm himself after the gunfight Jeffrey began to read the New Year honours list. Hours later he crawled out at the foot of the BEMs ...Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec  with an aching head disappointed not to say bitter. Would his devotion to the Queen never mind Nigel Farage never be rewarded?Philip Pullman PhilipPullman Dec Happy New Year to everyone from me Jeffrey Polka Sviatoslav wherever he may be and the ranks of the SSO both dead and alive.,books,cfib87n,18,t5_2qh4i

Everything the characters were doing was basically despite the depth of emotion and thought that Woolf exposes so beautifully inconsequential and would be swept aside.The second section describes the degradation and later restoration of the house over a number of years along with the deaths of major characters seemed to being this home for me.The third section was my least favourite mainly because I wasnt committed to the kids now grown up as characters and mainly wanted to read about Lily Birscoe and her painting. Also the whole process of Lilys painting and the way she did it and thought about it was wonderfully evoked.And I havent read Ms. Dalloway for years but will revisit it soon and will read more and more Woolf.,books,cfjrtio,1,t5_2qh4i

It was a tough and arduous decision for George to make to kill lenny lenny after all being his best friend who he loved just for being a childlike adult with simplistic pleasures. They had dreams and plans together however George realized this was merely an idealized future. Lenny was going to hold George back throughout his life anyway. George was in effect lennys father. However lenny was a child that needed constant supervision and when he killed that mans daughter George knew there was no hope left for both of them. He realized he had to kill lenny himself rather than have lenny suffer through trial or have anyone else kill him since they were all looking for him. It was an unfortunate time for them to live in no understanding of leniency on the mentally challenged.

As far as I can tell after reading it the story of the Worlds fair is only vaguely connected to the story of Holmes. Also I think Larsen stretches the liberties of a supposedly non fiction writer pretty thin at certain points. I recall one episode where he describes an incident in Holmes childhood where two older boys scare him. The incident probably did occur but with a different choreography. More likely the two older boys discovered that their fiveyearold victim did not mind the excursion ... When his eyes settled back on his captors it was they who fled.

567121,0,t3_20m5qv,Ive read the Dark Elf Trilogy Icewind Dale Trilogy and the first three of four books in the series following that.Chronologically the Dark Elf Trilogy is the first of the entire Drizzt series but is written second fourth through sixth novels. The Dark Elf Trilogy is a wonderful series with some very unique features for a fantasy novel. The first novel explores a young man being born and raised up in a society of villainy and shows how the innocence of other youths is sucked away as theyre shaped into the monsters that the drow are known to be. The following two novels tell the story of how Drizzt adapts to the world beyond his heritage. I particularly love the final book in the trilogy but on the whole it is very rock solid and worth reading especially if you are already familiar with the Forgotten Realms.

584013,0,t3_20jilf,Recently I started playing Civ  and its expansions and it got me wondering if anyone had any suggestions on the best books about some of the playable civilizationsleaders in the games? Ive always had an interest in history and it just got me thinking that Id love to read some quality books about some of these figures. Not even necessarily only about the leaders but even just the civilizations they led. Hope its clear what Im asking here haha.I guess in particular Id be wondering about Alexander Montezuma Ramses Hiawatha Genghis Khan Caesar Gustavus Adolphus Gilgamesh and Ragnar. But if theres a great book or two about a civ or a leader that I didnt list please suggest it!Id probably prefer a nonfiction that isnt too scholarly but Im certainly open to historical fiction as well.Thank you for your suggestions ,books,cg6nnaj,1,t5_2qh4i

594484,0,t1_cg7tug7,Ive spent plenty time with Tolkien. I spent a lot of time loving LotR and considering it the pinnacle of fantasy... until Malazan. Heres the thing. As a linguist Tolkien was brilliant. He created a very rich and lush mythology for a single continent of a mere few thousand years. LotR reads as mythologyfolklore too pristine and polished to feel like a real world. Erikson and Esselmont have created dozens of cultures and mythologies that play out on a world of multiple continents over the course of at least a hundred thousand years. The ramifications of conflicts between cultures and individuals ripple out affecting the shape of the Malazan world. The world feels like a real world. I can believe that Darujistan and the Seven Cities and Lether are real places with real politics and teirs of socioeconomic status. I do not believe The Shire is a real place. I believe it is representative of an ideal of a place.However this is the beauty of the reading life.

Without that knowledge though what it looks like is that the casting directors took a character that had been cast as black for several movies and replaced her with a white girl at precisely the moment she gained real presence in the series which results in a bunch of annoyed andor offended people. Im not so bothered by this since Lavender is a pretty annoying character but try and understand that people from all over the world enjoy this series and it would have been kind of cool to have another person of color in this magical world of mostly white people. And right when they had it all set up to happen whoosh! They pulled the ol whitey switcheroo. I personally dont see why they couldnt have just auditioned black girls there would have been no controversy and they could have found a very good black actress.

654243,0,t1_cgek5i0,gt I remember it saying something along the lines of you cant get to Ultima by searching for it or something like that.This reminded me of a documentary series by NRK titled Ultima Thule where they invited eight writers on a journey to Nordkalotten. One of the writers a nice old man said at one point Ultima Thule is a place youll never reach.I googled it now thanks to you and found an interesting article at E which is a nice site Id forgotten about so thank you also for leading me to find that again. Heres an excerptgt Ultima Thule is a latin phrase. But is it a place or an idea? Thule pronounced thoo lee was the name used by the ancient explorer Pytheas in the th century BC for a remote island to the north of Orkney. It might have been Shetland Jutland Norway or perhaps Iceland we dont know. Ultima Thule is the almost mythical land farthest north. Literally we could say that it is the North Pole but it is more interesting as a symbol something that we strive for but never quite reach.The article also recites a poem so be sure to click through the link above and check that out.,books,cgemy65,24,t5_2qh4i

717528,0,t1_cgldgf9,While I agree about music and a story each having their own emotional highs and lows I disagree that it detracts from the story Im reading. Perhaps this is true for some maybe even many people but not for me. If Im in a room where the tv is on or somewhere that people are chatting I find it hard to focus on my book. I find that listening to some of my favorite movie scores or classical music pieces through my headphones helps me to be able to focus again. Maybe because Ive listened to them so many times they become like white noise? Im not sure but I honestly read best as you said with silence or with some kind of wordless orchestral music on. So while I guess its true that it does detract from the music as I am hearing it but not listening to it the music actually enhances my ability to engage with a book in some circumstances. When I want to listen to music for the pure enjoyment of listening to music I am not reading just listening fully engaged with the piece.

735473,0,t1_cgm73j7,A major reason someone would not like a first person narrator book is if they dont like the character who is narrating it.  It can be annoying if the narrators views seem too shortsided or if you dont like the opinions or judgments he makes.  Some of those narrators are characters who happen to be pretentious and annoying.Reading a book of a firstperson narrator you loathe can at its worst be like an obnoxious person like for example a political figure you cant stand screaming in your ear about hisher perceived problems and telling you that you should think the exact same way. In some cases it can be an irritant you cant ignore.  Thirdperson is more likely to give a more balanced objective view of what is going on in the story but firstperson shuts you into an echo chamber of one persons thoughts unless the author switches narrators or provides other external information.  Many writers do it well and create more powerful likable characters but its riskier because its placing all faith onto one character.Your students dislike means that they are engaged in the book enough to form a dislike of a character or style so thats good.  They may read a lot on their own.  Reading can be a personal matter and people dont really like being told what books they are supposed to like or being shamed if they dont really like those books so much.  Of course in school there has to be a middle ground.  All teachers have to worry about though is the students doing the work and learning from the books theyre reading.  They dont necessarily need to like the book to learn from it.,books,cgnvl80,1,t5_2qh4i

769688,0,t3_22xe3u,Just throwing in my two cents. I read a lot of scifi and a bit of other fiction and nonfiction. I would have to suggest that in part at least its because the quality of writing in in scifi books is often pretty poor. For example I adore Frank Herberts works From Whipping Star to the Dune series I have enjoyed them all well all I have been able to get hold of. I love his ideas and how thought provoking his works are I love the scope of the stories. However his actual writing sentence by sentence is terrible I can forgive the bad writing because I love the imagination. I find the same with Gibson the ideas are wonderful the vision of his distopian futures gritty and plausible but the writing is adequate at best. I find that holds with a lot of scifi the thought experiments and extrapolations are what hold my attention and the writing itself is poor. I can enjoy the works regardless but I dont blind myself to their flaws.Also even with authors whose writing is excellent scifi seems to be weaker in part I think this comes from the constraints of the genre. With a fiction set in knowable place and time there is no need to explain the background or the social structure or indeed much of anything that isnt directly relevant. To see what I mean try reading some Iain Banks Iain M Banks for the Scifi his writing is in both cases excellent and the works thoroughly enjoyable but I would suggest that the more prosaic fiction has better flow.  In case anyone is going to read him on my recommendation I think his best Scifi is The Algebraist and the best of his other books The Crow Road. ,books,cgrro06,4,t5_2qh4i

792652,0,t1_cgu6p0w,If you dont mind me adding my two cents as an ordained pastor and were talking about the Grand InquisitorRebellion passages right? I love those passages with a passion because they really dont mess around describing the problem of evil. The Inquisitor passage ends with a kiss from Jesus to the Inquisitor. And that kiss is remarkable in that The Inquisitor lets Jesus go because of it. The kiss is important because the love displayed there is so reminiscent of the love displayed in the crucifixion a self giving love that is offered to those who are not only undeserving but hostile to that loves very existence. This is the beauty of Alyoshas kiss to Ivan at the end of the passage. In the parable Ivan becomes the inquisitor and Alyosha becomes the Christfigure. So instead of a great defense of a God that allows such inhumanity Alyosha instead defers to an act of love in the face of his own inquisitor. The writing is great there Ivan responds to his brothers kiss with something akin to you stole my ending!The implicit setup that Dostoyevsky has prepared is that if God is love one way love to people who dont deserve it uniquely divine and infinitely self giving then perhaps there is some greater reason why God allows the atrocities to happen. Only this great act of infinite selfgiving love Jesuss death and resurrection would give pause to any Inquisitor and inspire the hope ! that God will one day answer the mystery himself.Lol sorry for giving you my twocents if they werent asked for  Good question thanks for asking it!,books,cgudmm4,14,t5_2qh4i

807606,0,t3_23d7j8,Im noticing that the main complaint about this article and most defenders of the book are saying But Gus is SUPPOSED to be pseudointellectual and pretentious because hes doing it on purpose! And thats for whatever existential reason his character is touting. But my personal problem with this argument is that someone talking like his character does is completely unrealistic purposefully or not. The only reason I could possibly fathom someone using overly complex English dashed with Shakespearean influences to describe random topics would be from someone with some strange disconnect with society that makes them think theyre cool because of that.Aside from this the rest of the book was very predictable with few actual instances of depth from the characters that most of the time made me cringe. I dont remember Hazel having a particularly sound reason for her infatuation to which some would say Because shes a teenager! but that doesnt make it seem any less staged. The characters in the book were flat which is ironic because the book seemed to be trying so hard to say Look at how deep these kids are! They act like this because reasons! More than anything I felt like Hazel and Gus were just two unfortunate kids constantly trying to impress each other through unrealistic personalities which doesnt add depth to them or make me sympathize. It just feels silly.For a brief period it spread among the girls at my school like wildfire with its easy to read structure and short length.

I agree with you saying that certain books that are boy demographic are bought by them but those books got publicity. Lemmony Snicket got publicity by the film which made me at least want to read the whole series. Same with Narnia and Harry Potter and Middle Earth and Disc World novels but they got publicity with movies or TV series. New fiction for boys is undervalued and is rarely published a polar opposite  years ago when girls were being ignored. At that time though gems were made such as Jane Austen which became popular when the girl demographic got more support  years ago nobody read her books when she was alive. New boy fiction is being ignored by the stores online or not and they dont get publicity. The Harry Potter stories started out as completely unigender focused but in my opinion having read them got too gushy and by the seventh it was more like  to  in favour of girls than  .

828905,0,t1_cgy6oq4,Thats not what Im saying at all. The article infers that women cannot observe and respond to those unique gendered pressures as if the only way you can understand them is by having the same genitals. That is sexist. J. K. Rowling I gave as simply one example that disproves this concept.I dont believe boys and girls are subject to the same pressures in later replies I state that boys are often subjected to peer pressure that discourages reading as in some places reading is seen as feminine. I do believe books can be written that appeal to certain genders more  children response to stereotypes more than most just as they are more influenced by peer pressure. The article the OP posted however seemed to say that women are incapable of recognising this fact and that the increase in women in publishing had some sort of influence on boys not reading not peer pressure.My argument is that the gender of the writer and publishers is not relevent  if they are a good writerpublisher they will recognise these facts and incorporate them into their work regardless of their dangly bits. Writers and publishers already come from a very different generation  being much older then the children so they already need to interpret and observe and craft their work to fit. But they can craft and interpret all they want to  if reading is seen as uncool and parents dont encourage their kids to read MUCH bigger influence on boys reading its not going to work. If all the publishing houses stopped marketing books tomorrow kids would still find things to read whether it be existing books fanfiction selfpublished books etc but first they have to actually want to read!Tldr the article is diverting the blame away from the real influences on kids reading  peer pressure parents ie fathers not buying books or encouraging their kids to read books and internet both the exposure to books it can give and its distraction with gamesmoviessocial media.,books,cgyhy3v,1,t5_2qh4i

834073,0,t3_23ojta,Theres a long history of putting social criticism in a villains mouth. For example the most cutting critique of sexism in Westeros comes from Cersei Lannister a villain. In Gone Girl Amyspoiler makes an amazingly bitter and cutting critique of sexism but shes a villain. So people can choose to swallow her critique or not shes either saying something daring and incisive or shes just a crazy bitch.This reads to me as... sketchy especially when you then write your villains not as their own kind of villain but as strawmen built by people who hate in this case women. Having a woman whose methods of doing evil include pregnancy scares false rape accusations and eventually spermjackingspoiler reads like someone from rMensRights drew a picture of what they think a woman is like. Its roughly as insulting as having a black villain who defrauds the government for welfare money manipulates white liberal guilt for cynical profit beats up gentiles at the behest of his Jewish masters and rapes white women. It takes one stereotypethe Manic Pixie Dream Girland cleverly subverts it by turning her into another stereotype the maneating witchy feminazi hagspoiler.I suppose I didnt really have a question I just wanted to say that. The book certainly got a reaction out of me I think its the third time ever that reading a book has made me angry at the author. Youre not going to please everyone but you did have enough of a reaction on me that when I saw the post I had to come here and write this.

881337,0,t1_ch4fwjc,Its an interesting idea one Ive toyed with a lot but it seems improbable. GRRM has been writing the same story for some odd twenty years now probably much longer and it is unlikely he has not come to some sort of conclusion on how the story ends.However as you say I do believe he has in a way wrote himself into a corner. Because I think he had an idea before the story flourished on how it would end  or at least a summarizing conclusion of sort  but now the characters have taken different turns than he originally planned turns that will not allow him to bind up the sack quite so easily. Imagine that you are drawing a painting. You know what you want to draw and thus you begin to draw an outlying sketch with a pencil on a x canvas all giddy and ecstatic. You finish the sketch not quite as you planned but you can see the potential beneath. You know you can create a beautiful picture.So naturally you begin to color it in. You spill a little here and go a little out of the frame there but you know it will all only contribute to the uniqueness and glory of the painting.Then one day when you have finished it by half you realize that the canvas isnt big enough. By far. You try on a x but repainting all that is just too much hard work. So you get to work on adding to the already existing sides and the painting just keeps growing bigger and bigger never really finishing.That is what I believe  if you excuse my lengthy example  has happened to G.R.R.M. He knows how he wants the painting to look from the first pencil stroke to the last stroke of his brush but when his painting keeps getting bigger all the time then it is not quite so simple anymore.,books,ch4gm76,3,t5_2qh4i

899581,0,t3_24db1y,This reminds me of the time that I decided to make up an English paper. As I spent most of my time chatting with internet people on the internet and complaining about things I had postponed doing my English paper for quite some time. Realizing that there was no time to conduct the research process under normal manners I was forced to resort to drastic measures.Pulling out my thesaurus I quickly wrote up quotes to prove that students do indeed perform better in school when listening to pop music! I made up a lie and quickly typed in with  WPM that it was recently scientifically proved by scientists that students get better grades in school when they listen to music. John Science and made up a quick works cited. I added in  average high schoolers were taken to an MRI machine and the student who frequented rap concerts was less stressed. Realizing this was a foolproof lie I simply spilled some white out on the works cited by accident to hide the invalid source and only lose a few points for invalid use of white out.I turned my paper in the next minute and the teacher took  seconds to read it. She applauded my use of direct quotes but she was PISSED when she noticed my works cited was improperly disguised. She informed me that I would be expelled and placed into prison for plagiarism unless I could properly cite my GOD DAMN sources! Due to the fact that I completely made up the study now that my paper was under intense scrutiny there was no way I could lie!I talked to my peers in high school and one of them threatened to stop being my friend if I went to jail because i dont roll with those who drop the soap roll and he was right. I had to find a quick way to get this study done and I realized the only way to do this was to conduct the study myself. I went to a local college to see if a professor would be able to allow me to study stress areas and help me start the study but Docta Pizzle just threw me out of his classroom for not bringing a customary gift. Fearful of what the world would do because I couldnt replicate the scientific study I entered classroom BLANKClassroom and saw a teacher talking to imaginary students. Docta Scott Patterson the dating advice genius was giving horrible dating advice to his students and informed me that he was attempting to practice being a pick up line teacher. I however felt the story would not go in the right direction to post later if I went with him and left to find another teacher.The great great grandsons great uncle of Steven Hawking worked at this school as a lowly paper stacker for the dean of the school. I went to the deans office to try to get an official stamp to forge results of the test but as he was affectionately known Steven Hawk King or Stehawk was quick to stop me. I told Stehawk the wonders of scientific study and how he could advance both his career and his life if he only joined me for one scientific study and going in the ways of his great nephews great great grandfather Steven Hawking Stehawk decided he would join me in the venture.We first needed two average high schoolers but Stehawk was quick to inform me that he was not allowed to go within  feet of my high school due to his evil pranking ways when he was a student. Stehawk had filled the principles lunchbox with SALAD DRESSING and the principle was so damn pissed at this that he didnt even allow the real Steven Hawking to give a presentation on success later that day. I snuck into the school but as it was normal school hours the sneaking part wasnt really necessary. As I walked past the principles office I could hear my English teacher Principle Lotomotive and Sheriff Zane all talking about the plans to arrest me for plagiarism. I sped to the alley behind the gym and found a few drug smoking nobodies. They all ran when I shined my  limited edition flashlight at them but one rap listening kid with his eyes closed was so out of it that he didnt see the light. I told him I would give him free herbs and spices if he followed me and he did come indeed. When I went back outside Stehawk had collected his great nephew in order for the fake MRI testing. I however realized that I would need to use a real MRI machine to test the stress areas of the brain and so we had to be admitted to a hospital in an illegal manner. I busted out my street soccer derby kit and was promptly hit by a bus drivers fistWhen I woke up Stehawk and the two high schoolers were in the MRI room with me and Stehawk sucker punched the MRI attendant right in the knuckle to knock it unconscious. We quickly performed an MRI on both of the high school students and found that the one under the influence of multiple types of drugs and rap music was less stressed! Realizing we had come upon a scientific miracle I quickly began writing a lab report using Stehawks name. Unfortunately for us Principle Lotomotive and gang had tracked down Stehawk as they believed him to have accidentally walked within  feet of a high school during the testing. Picking up a vial of salad dressing Stehawk proved the principle wrong by calculating the distance between the school and the vial but Lotomotive was no man to admit his mistakes. Getting in a fist fight the MRI attendant woke up and revealed himself to actually be Scott Patterson testing out a new pickup line! He turned to my English teacher and said hey girl yo dress looks nice causing the whole room to swoon at the romance.When I came back to class  months later I turned in the works cited page of my research paper and had put the name Steven Hawking as the researcher. However remembering Stehawk as a representation of a horrible relationship she broke up with Scott Patterson after  dates I got an F for the paper but at least I didnt plagiarize! that much ,books,ch6jcos,-1,t5_2qh4i

With the print book I always set the pace. When I get distracted it is very easy to pick up from where I left off. With the audio book I have to search for the for the last thing I remember hearing. To really enjoy an audio book I have to listen to it exclusively with minimal interruptions and even then loosing my place is very disrupting.,books,ch9r6q4,1,t5_2qh4i

933339,0,t1_chacdcc,Thats if you take her character at face value. I dont relate to the narcissistic and shallow traits and at first these traits did irritate me too but it was only when I really studied her character in depth and took a psychological stance where I realised that theres so much going on beneath the exterior which I could relate to completely. It was so strange because as I read the play certain red flags stood out for me like her relationship with Mitch for example. She was overexposed to idealism and superficiality throughout her life that there was no one around to bring her back down to earth. Mitch seemed to be the one genuine person who she needed to help her become grounded because his senses went no further than reality while her head was stuck in the clouds. She used idealism to help protect her mind from all the bad that happened in her past but in the end that corrupted her mind that much more. Her narcissistic tendencies where apparent because they helped her avoid the reality of herself as a person  if she could use her physical appearance to show people that she had it together and she was completely fine in herself then maybe she could convince herself of it too. She was still an insecure little girl who didnt know how to grow up and everything she did was done to show the opposite of that. Not one person could understand her as she needed to be understood so they all reacted in such ridiculous ways e.g. Mitch rehected her after hearing gossip from Stanley who raped her and Stella sent her to what I think was the mental institution? I was just a few marks away from getting an A on a  or  word essay which was mainly about her! Theres so much going on with her.

936438,0,t1_chaek5f,War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy greatly impacted me in the way I view events around me as far as understanding how to objectively classify the full subjective experience you receive and how to relate to others who perhaps differently objectively classify their own subjective experience. Basically empathize with others because we all perceive and respond to things differently. It was a powerful takeaway from a very powerful and surprisingly engaging book but I wouldnt say its for everyone. If you arent a strong reader of fiction you may struggle with its size and the initial challenge of remembering a breadth of characters names. Other books that have impacted me strongly The Things they carried by tim obrien. I give this very high recommendations. IT is powerful and thought provoking and not a large time committment at all. East of Eden by John Steinback powerful. And as a final note reading all sorts of fiction has been the most rewarding personal development I could have experienced. Which isnt to say stop reading those personal development books but... theres tons to be found in fiction as well. Best of luck!

948472,0,t3_24z8li,It really is comparing apples to oranges. On the level of a theme they can both have just as deep meaning in this area. The biggest difference I find is the immersion into the story. Novels especially series tend to have more depth in terms of side plots and have more room to create a complex story line. Graphic novels on the other hand allow the author to steer your imagination in the right direction when novels cant. They are both wonderful mediums to tell a story it really comes down to a preference. Novels tend to be used more in education because there is typically more content to work with not always the case though.,books,chc3kf4,5,t5_2qh4i
949128,0,t3_24z8li,Im an avid reader of both novels and comicsgraphic novels. I like both and I think I basically get the same thing from both. That thing is the ability to explore new characters places and experiences. So I dont really see them as different when it comes to how and why I experience them. When it comes to the visual aspect of comicsgraphic novels they help me see the story more clearly it basically shows me what everything and everybody looks like but a good author can do that just as well with words. But sometimes the drawings in graphic novels have the ability to add an extra layer to the story take for example Habibi by Craig Thompson. That book is gorgeous to look at all the little details in the drawings added an extra layer of enjoyment while reading the book.It is easy to dismiss comicsgraphic novels for being less deep than novels but I think that is a simplistic way of looking at them. If you take a look at Sandman by Neil Gaiman you see a series full of subplots side developments and interesting characters that we only see glimpses of. That series alone has spawned a variety of spinoffs including one about Lucifer and another about Death. On top of that it also shows that Neil Gaiman is a very versatile author who embraces both mediums to do the same thing tell a story. Of course there is also your fluff when it comes to comics that hardly has any symbolism and is just telling an action story but there are a lot of novels that arent very deep either. An interesting development I have noticed in the last couple of years is that more novels are being adapted as graphic novels. Just of the top of my head A Game of Thrones The Eye of the World City of Bones Twilight and the list goes on and on.,books,chc6974,1,t5_2qh4i

Absolutely stunning prose and characterisations that linger long after. Its a treasure.The latter is an odyssey of selfdiscovery in the guise of a mystery novel as narrated by a teenager with Aspergers. Its a fascinating perspective through a filter that isnt often employed in fiction and its conclusion is incredibly uplifting in a very subtle understated way.Beyond those The Body by Stephen King has been my favorite book as part of Different Seasons since I first read it twenty years ago.

Comon in the paragraph I mentioned this I explained why their SETTING is the less informative quality. You keep doing this completely misunderstanding statements.gtThanks. This why its not a good idea to be snarky in coversations. Because comments like this come back to haunt you honestly if you dont know when a windmill occurred in Frankenstein you didnt read it very closely. This gap in your recollection of Frankenstein would be akin to forgetting that an attic or a fire was somehow important to Jane EyreI was actually mirroring your silence on points that you no longer argue successfully. Youve done this at many a turn in this exchange. Had you not ignored the myriad of points you had I would have acknowledged my mistaking the film for the book.gtI covered this when I said its nearly impossible to trace genres back to a single source work. Literature is a steady progression not a series of big leaps. I am offering Shelley as the best contender for the instigator of the genre. As I have said though there is no clear line marking the beginning of any genre because all stories are just amalgamations of tropes from other stories. We call Tolkien the creator of high fantasy but you can trace almost all the tropes of high fantasy to earlier works  he was just the most important example of putting it all together. So anyway if you have a better contender than Shelley let me know which Id be interested to hear which you think. So lets be clear here your original point was that Shelly was one of the first to start exploring science fiction themes. I provided a link which showed not just that you were incorrect but that you were more than  years off the mark. I also explained why some ancient myths are in fact science fiction. You ignored that and are now moving the goal posts by saying Ive not provided a better contender. Again you should click on the link. Im not going to repeat this point.gtTechnology not science. Ive already explained multiple times why science is more than just technology. And Ive already stated that they are not separate but just because technology is an output of science doesnt mean all technology IS science.And I already explained why youre wrong to separate the two for literature. Technology is most certain is science. Science is most certainly technology.gtAlready explained why theyre not. Because science has to involve the scientific method something which didnt exist when stories of these two characters were written and you still have not yet told me specifically which stories you are alluding to incidentally.And I already explained why science does NOT need to involve the scientific method which MAY have indeed existed when these stories were written and pointed to bronze age metallurgy. You dropped that point. This is also why I specifically mentioned you dont understand what empiricism is. I also have quite specifically told you which stories I am referring to by and this isnt snark by referring to those stories. If you wanted to know why I wrote Pay attention! this is a phenomenal recurrent example of why youre getting quite frustrating. ,books,chlvfzj,1,t5_2qh4i

1035530,0,t3_25x2wo,So an interesting thing about Newton.  During Newtons time the dominant philosophy was Exegesis the idea that all the worlds knowledge had already been discovered by the ancient societies and all answers could be found in the great works of antiquity.  So learned people studied old books like the Bible and the great Greek and Roman scientists.  Then Newton came along and while Calculus built on the works that had come before him his idea of Universal Gravitation That the same force that pulls apples down to the earth is what keeps the planets revolving around the sun was so revolutionary so new that it blew away Exegesis.  What Newton was proposing had never ever been found in any old book and it worked!  I think that Newton was the final nail in the coffin of Exegesis and ushered in the idea that we can discover new knowledge in the natural world and that there were more great discoveries to be found!  ,books,chlztgj,3,t5_2qh4i

I truly feel like I know all the characters even the ones who arent considered main characters. The first book only has maybe  pages before it jumps right into it and from here shit just gets crazy. I wish I could give a good explanation of the plot but honestly saying anything may ruin it. I cant even give you the main characters last name richard. If your willing to read.. I think its  books I HIGHLY recommend getting the series.

1077678,0,t3_26dvxn,  Were Made But Not By Me literally turned my life around  its almost shocking what profound impact the book had on me. The book itself is really just about cognitive dissonance but I found the implications to be far reaching. The world as you see it or remember it is not the world that actually exists. Your senses and memory construct an internal model of it all and thats the thing you actually experience  and the mechanisms that build it all are surprisingly cavalier  about simply patching up any details with total bullshit or simply get stuck in some odd glitch every now and then which make you know with utterly complete conviction that something is true which is verifiably impossible. The point is not only are you often wrong you are wrong in ways that make you incapable of knowing you are wrong. And its the same for everyone else too no matter how brilliant or reasonable they may be. The point is you literally need other people to make sense of the world and deal with problems in an accurate and reliable way. The point is you simply have to stop yourself from thinking you are always right about certain things and listen to other peoples experience. It makes empathy a necessary survival tool. It makes a diversity in points of view an obviously valuable resource. These are all very important lessons everyone can greatly benefit from and this book does a very good job driving them home in a very indirect way...

1088441,0,t3_26km51,Hi!  Teacher here I just wanted to throw some ideas at you...Do you have kids or do you have siblingsfamily friends with kids or is there an elementary school nearby?  If hes able your father might be more willing to read kids books if he was reading them almost like a book group with a kid  he reads kid reads they get together and talk about it.  Or studies show that reading books to kids who cant read yet and then talking about the books is really helpful for the development of reading skills if you know of any kids who cant read yet maybe he can read to them.  I dont know where he is in his recovery but the kids I teach LOVE to have grandparent figures around to read towith them.Now on to books.  Almost every kids book will have some sort of marking on the back usually near the bottom indicating its difficulty level.  Sometimes it will show grade level in a grademonth format i.e. . is nd grade ninth month.  Sometimes there will be letters.  Sometimes there will be other numbers that arent the grade level.  It all depends on what the publisher uses.  This chart will help you convert all of the different labels so you can figure out what level something is on.  I think this will be especially helpful for you because many of the books I see listed here are more upperelementary in grade level so you can know for sure before you bring them.  However if your dad can read them then you can check out the level and find out if othre books will be easier or harder than that book he read successfully.Additionally this library in vermont has a list of adult books for new readers!  It looks like many are retellings of classics.Good luck!,books,chs0bgy,22,t5_2qh4i

Second they are as radically different as two books written in the th century by English speakers can be in many ways but in other ways they share some striking similarities particularly in their fixation on violence and myth as reality. The differences are greater than the similarities though. While American Gods is violent its more like cartoon violence done to illustrate the tale. Blood Meridian is Cormac McCarthy violence a little more disturbing and less concerned with having a rationale.  I think you should read both if it makes a difference in which you pick first American Gods is written in language any bright high schooler could understand and Blood Meridian is challenging and full of difficult vocabulary. Cormac McCarthy and Mark Helprin are both very lyrical and sometimes difficult to follow Neil Gaiman you can just sort of read and absorb easily.,books,chsnrlb,3,t5_2qh4i

And thats kind of the point the wildlings are underestimated and dismissed as were the Fremen and the Aiel.  All three groups serve as educators and an untapped resource to those who recognize them for what they are.  And I think youll be surprised if you think the series will end without them being a real force.  As for historical examples I think GRRM depends more on a sort of cultural memory of group types than concrete examples.

1129211,0,t3_2716a6,Ive got a friend who has three or four unpublished novels. Ive read some of his work. Im also a washedup former English teacher so I have a few unfinished pieces of my own gathering dust in a forgotten corner of Google Docs. My answers are. Yes. I ask my writer friend about his writing all the time. He is serious about making art and creating something new. Our other novelist friend is serious about selfpublishing stupid crap about zombies with a sort of evangelical Christian overlay. We try not to ask him about it but he tells us anyway.. Leisure time and audience. Back in the day only wealthy gentlemen could write novels. Coal miners servants women etc. really had no free time and no concept of themselves as special snowflakes with special things to say. Most people have a little more free time and access to writing supplies as well as more education. Social media has given everyone a sense of selfimportance and a perceived audience hello reddit! so the idea of writing ideas and having them adored by masses is much closer to us than it was to say Jane Austen who had the time but not the selfesteem.. Please dont tell my friends but not really. Mine is brilliant of course but theirs is pedestrian I kid of course. Mine sucks too. EDIT I take that back. The most recent novel my writerfriend had me read is something I probably would have checked out of the library if I had pulled it off the shelf and leafed through it.Bonus Because you want to keep novel writing locked in an ivory tower. Or because most of the hacks churning out  words of crap have no idea how to write well. Or because NaNoWriMo is literally the stupidest abbreviation in history.

She isnt allowed to invite the Cunningham kid over because hes lowerclass although she is expected to be polite to him in keeping with her station as an upperclass Southern lady.Actually that was her aunt not Atticus at all. Unless youre talking about the scene where he goes into her bedroom and starts to tell her that at the behest of her aunt then tells her to forget he ever said anything like that.gt The Ewells are trash.Because of how they act and how they treat other people particularly black people. Atticus makes that very very clear. If anything the moral ambiguities in the book stem from the idea that holding a different belief doesnt make one a bad person you see that in the townspeople who agree with Atticus but stay silent and let him do the tough jobs or the ones who disagree with him but still elect him the state senate the next year.

1232979,0,t1_ci869rb,This is the only accurate explanation Ive seen here that didnt essentially just say the publishers are crying about new media. Also Amazon is fucking its customers by delaying the delivery of Hatchette books which is very odd for such a customer service oriented company.I would say Amazon is in the wrong here without a doubt. Everyone on reddit thinks this is market adaptability issue but you need a company to deliver content. The only argument that makes any sense is Well without publishers anyone can just offer their books directly and make more money. But that will never happen. There needs to be someone doing the business of art so the artist can make it. Take away the publishers and assume a  digital market and Amazon will become that company and they will control hardware with the Kindle and file types and price. I dont see traditional publishing going away but I also dont see any arguments put forth on how it will continue if the publishers crumble.Books are not an incredibly lucrative media like movies or music. Yes theyre special because they dont generate a huge amount of money and their customer base is much smaller.,books,ci8bsek,-1,t5_2qh4i
1233641,0,t3_288bfc,When I was around  or so I started getting into my parents Stephen King collection. Books like Carrie The Stand Salems Lot The Talisman. Straubs Shadowland. Then my friends and I read The Outsiders and formed a bond over it. It took off from there. By the time I was  or so I became quite aware of all the horrible things happening to my friends and family. I saw violence and manipulation and abuse. People getting stuck in lifestyles they arent interested in but obligated to. Personally I dealt with depression and personal insecurity among other fears. And then like so many others on rbooks I came across Slaughterhouse  by Kurt Vonnegut via the liner notes of Rise Againsts Sufferer and the Witness. The approximate idea that humans were the only race in the galaxy that claimed to have free will but didnt use it to stop atrocities really stuck with me. And that propelled me forward. The thought that I could find inspiration and solace in reading. I still look for answers in books and hope itll help make things make sense. Im not sure it helped. Reading can be a lonely and at times punishing hobby but I do quite love it. ,books,ci8egvt,5,t5_2qh4i

Its been a while since I read Farenheit and I remember I didnt enjoy it all that much as it didnt have particularly good prose but I dont really recall there being any scifi element other than the fact you could possibly call it scifi just for being dystopian.

He works well with the theme of memory and shows the ultimately pointless nature of nostalgia. What is the point of memory when we know there is no future? Can we just escape into those memories and ignore the truth about the world? America in particular enjoys living in its fake memories be they of the greatest generation or cowboys or the country as a pristine wilderness. The man in the Road is torn between his memories of his wife and life before and the hideous reality that he and his son are just prolonging an inevitable death. Which is in the end more valuable?

My interpretation of her philosophy is that you can only be happy as a selfactualized selfdetermined being living in a state of harmony with your ideals.  It is supremely self centered in the way that they say you cant truly love someone more than you love yourself.My ideals are peace love health empathy and responsibility for the community among other things and I fight to exhibit those qualities and live my life in accordance with those concepts.  Fighting relentlessly for what you believe in because you believe in it is a core tenet of the philosophy and one I whole hearted ly agree with. You cant make yourself or anyone happy by living for others at the expense of yourself live a successful flourishing existence and share your bounty to really improve life for yourself and those you care about. I have to say I agree with her philosophy but none of her conclusions.  The philosophy isnt good or bad but just a way of thinking of things.

Because the cloak was passed by inheritance and inheritance for most of history only went to legitimate children it is a safe assumption that Harry is also Anglo.

The amusing consensus mind you these were almost all KindleNook readers who now do all their book discovery online was as follows in order of priority. . Search for existing favorite authors new books. Read reviews. Cling to the positive reviews and try to ignore the negatives even if book is overwhelmingly reviewed negatively. When out of  move on to.... Search for backup authors you may have read one or two books by. Negative reviews hold much more weight here. . Look at NY TimesAmazon bestseller list. Judge first by cover then price then premise then reviews. Occasionally actually buy one of these. . Genre bestseller lists Scifi Thriller etc. Never heard of author? Judge  by cover.

As it turns most of what was left was done so because its honestly boring. There were a few parts that I was glad I read though. My point is if I had been reading a physical copy of the book I would have gotten discouraged during most of the boring parts and never finished it.

1420053,0,t1_ciu6iea,I am agreeing with you on this one. The biggest thing that has come to my mind while I am reading book one right now and being caught up on the show is how glad I am that I have a visual reference for a lot of the characters. The show experience really goes a long way in helping me keep my note taking to a minimum. DI realize at least for the first book or two that the show is remarkably true to the story only to diverge more as the stories continue but that hasnt affected the reading experience negatively for me at all. In fact I find it a lot of fun to encounter major plot points thinking oh awesome x is about to happen! and then a lot of times those events end up being at least slightly different maybe in dialog or in the description of environment and being able to reimagine the world in my head.For example at the beginning of book one I found it really exciting to have the opportunity to be reading an alternate version of Daenerys meeting Drogo in a large hall which GRRM does a wonderful job illustrating rather than outside on a horse even if it is such a minor difference. Another was the descriptions of Winterfell through the eyes and young imagination of Bran right before his fateful climb at the broken tower and just reading about that whole scene with an even slightly different more elaborate description in the book was just cool to me as a fan of the story in general.,books,ciua5ht,2,t5_2qh4i

1510300,0,t3_2bhuxm,Its been years and years since Ive read In Cold Blood but its one of my alltime favorites. Because its been so long Ill pass on Nos.  and . As for No.  youre spot on Capote was famous or infamous for not taking notes or using a tape recorder during interviews. He claimed to have nearperfect recollection and could pull quotes verbatim from memory. Of course this is almost certainly not true which is why theres a strong argument that Capote made up quotes throughout In Cold Blood. Made up is probably not the right phrase maybe misremembered is more accurate. In any case as uupquark pointed out Capote spent years and years and years on In Cold Blood  it was his masterwork in fact he didnt write anything of significance afterwards  and so its likely that the quotes he uses are at least accurate in sentiment even if they are not wordforword true.If you liked In Cold Blood definitely check out Capote the movie.

My second most favorite author in English.But Blade Runner is a superior piece of work as a movie compared to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep as a novel. You are expecting a movie to do what a book does. By your standards a movie like Stalker is an empty work well because it has little dialogue and consist mostly of images.Philip K Dick himself went to the movie set saw parts of the movie and told the director this is what I imagined. How did you do that?. This is what matters most in an adaptation. Not trying to cram as much material as possible in bullshit dialogue. Blade Runner is mostly an independent piece of work that takes place in the universe of Philip K Dicks book. It leaves a lot to viewers imagination. It is a very successful and great movie. ,books,cja0wm7,2,t5_2qh4i

Being at Woodstock and not being at least a little bit stoned would have been almost as much of a waste as what I did.So instead of enjoying the fuck out of some of the best years of my youth  I mostly was stoned.

Having said that I read the play after having seen the movie and its almost absurd how much better the movie is. In the movie Salieri is at least somewhat pitiable even if hes ultimately a bastard but in the play hes a bastard all the way through even forcing Mozarts wife to pimp herself out in order for her husband to acquire a position at court only to reject her just to humiliate her. For reference in the film this wouldve been the beautiful scene in which Salieri sees Mozarts original copies of music with no corrections of any kind not one.People have already mentioned Fight Club and The Godfather which are two more of my favorites.Another adaptation I love although it was made into a miniseries rather than a movie is Angels in America. Both the miniseries and the twopart play of the same name are incredible. Al Pacino turns in one of the best performances of his career. Its right up there alongside Michael Coreleone.

And amazon knows a ton about what happens when you play with the prices because amazon does nothing but play with prices and algorithms all day long. Unlike Ms Kellogg.,books,cjj013m,1,t5_2qh4i

Why is it considered that the ebook is priced too high? Why isnt it that the paper book is priced too low?

It could be something like astigmatism which is not serious or even just needing a better prescription. Eyesight does change and even small hardly noticeable differences can have a big impact. In my life my reading and studying comprehension always suffers when my eyesight is compromised.. Concentration. I recommend watching at least the first  minutes of this lecture on studying smart It is evidencebased advice. The professor cites research showing that the amount of time an average student can work productively without a break is  minutes. For some people it is even less. If a person keeps working after that point concentration drops precipitously. That would be stressful particularly if you feel you have a lot of work to do.

When they met later in the series they both suddenly have a lot of responsibility thrust upon them. Egwene being bullied into leading the rebels in an attempt to establish a puppet government then actually leading the rebels trying to reunite the Tower then leading the Tower against a background of extreme politiking and eventually trying to save the world by influencing the Dragon Reborn.Gawyn was by his high status and swordmanship expected to lead the Younglings and protect the Aes Sedai eventually becoming the First Prince of the Sword for Elayne.Both roles had massive amounts of responsibilities Egwenes choice was to go for duty Gawyn very much love. Egwene later regrets the choice hence her actions in the Last Battle.As for people forgetting about the love interest I may be wrong but not many people knew the true feelings they had for each other and they are both young.

Mattia didnt get his desired relationship with Alice and vica versa and Alice didnt tell Mattia about how she might have seen his sister. But its still not a depressing ending I always found its quite fitting actually. I also liked how theyre both outsiders.    ,books,cjwupmk,1,t5_2qh4i

1751756,0,t1_cjzax37,Most readers of Burroughs already know about who or what Burroughs was about before they get to the book. This is not the normal path to reading a book but its been the fate of writers like Bukowski or Burroughs. The thing is though most of what people know about him is wrong or mostly wrong and then they approach the book with that incorrect knowledge informing their reading.What I meant about postwar lit and s pop culture is that Burroughs was mostly riffing on pop culture ideas from the time and parodying them in the letters that eventually became NL. You can literally pick out the phrases from ads articles and reviews of other things in Time Life etc. from the time. He was appropriating the references and siphoning them back into his various stories and things that he wrote to people. Later Ginsburg collected and edited it all into Naked Lunch.Having read the book as many times as I have now I cant say there is much about his life that is really important to enjoying the book. His bio is definitely interesting but I cant think of how it is crucial for getting NL since the book is really mostly word games and jokes and basically a selfcontained unit.,books,cjzytm2,2,t5_2qh4i

He may be a completely innocent and misunderstood author or he may actually have some kind of psychiatric issue that makes him a danger to himself or others.  That is completely beside the point.If you go back and look at my first reply to you and apply even a modicum of reading comprehension youll see that nowhere did I talk about weather or not this was justified. I didnt try to defend the author his writings or the actions taken by those involved.   I was providing more information about what an emergency medical evaluation is.You postedgtYou dont even know what that means. Was he taken against his will? You have no clue.I provided the information you were looking for notably that he was very likely taken against his will.As an aside I think that the psych. hold is rather benign. Its a standard common practice when one has reason to believe that someone is a credible threat to themselves or those around them for psychiatric reasons...   It may even be a great way for him to prove that he isnt a danger to his students. Its not really a justification for denying peoples freedom of movement but once this happens its pretty easy to prove you dont have a psychiatric disorder.

Schools dont bother with reading till kindergartenfirst grade for a very good reason. It is not needed. But they dont realize is that they are inhibiting other stages of development. In fact forcing a child to do things before they are necessary prevents them from learning the things they should be learning. Under  is a very critical stage in child development. What is learned here sets them up for life. Teaching them something that is very limited and not useful to them doesnt mean they will grow up to win the Nobel Prize. This is the stage where they develop imagination creativity social skills and how they will learn things for the rest of their life.The most important thing you can do for a child under  is give them legos Lincoln logs tinker toysand other kids to play with and send them on their way.By forcing them to read you are forcing them to have a very linear way of learning. Open play sets the structure for learning in many parts of the brain. Reading is just one very specific part.So when you hear everyone complaining that these kids graduate from college and cant think outside of the box this is why.it is because they gave them a book instead of a box to play with. ,books,ckdjm0c,3,t5_2qh4i

1886787,0,t1_ck8rn83,As an American it was the first novel by an Australian author that Ive read. It made me want to read more maybe Patrick White? but ultimately I was disappointed. The first third roughly was all right although the love scenes were uneven in how well they were written. The second third was simply excellent powerful writing depicting the trials of the Burma Death Railway. The final third started well with insight into the minds of the captors but Flanagan wrapped it up too tightly. This strained my ability to suspend my disbelief to an extent that I felt it almost ruined the novel. Overall I would read it for the first twothirds but ultimately I do not personally find it worthy of the Booker.As for the Aussie stuff as I said it was really eyeopening and made me want to learn more.

The Public Burning is the second most how the hell could anyone write this book Ive ever read behind Mason amp Dixon. The chapters narrated by Uncle Sam are especially awe inspiring from a language lovers perspective. Its unreal.I just finished The SotWeed Factor last week and loved every minute of it. The satire is biting but even ignoring that level its just a damn funny extraordinarily wellwritten book.

A woman killed one on a hunting trip only to find the flesh had turned green. I heard a lot about strange tumours which locals assumed had to do with the animals drinking water contaminated by tar sand toxins. But mostly I heard about how the moose were simply gone.gt And not just in Alberta. Rapid Climate Changes Turn North Woods into Moose Graveyard read a May  headline in Scientific American.

1914388,0,t3_2gk1hn,Yep Ive read it. Its great and absolutely worth every moment of time it takes to read.Personally I found that once you put an oar into Swanns Way the current will carry you along through the rest of the series even if take  years to get there as it did in my case. My only advice would be not to rush it as it is more important that you absorb the meaning of the prose than that you rush the book or finish it.I read various translations. The CK Scott Moncrieffs are beautiful but have some startlingly bad anachronisms  the worst of which was that in the middle of a French novel he suddenly inserts it could be any Tom Dick or Harry. Theres the Moncrieffs old ones various editions the Moncrieffs w T. Kilmartin in a beautiful vintage books volume edition and then the Moncrieff and T. Kilmartin and D.J. Enright modern library editions meaning these other names revised and edited Moncrieff and each other Those were all great. The only volume of the new Penguin translations I read was John Sturrocks Sodom and Gomorrah and frankly the prose did not jive in the same way as it did when Moncrieff was the originator it in fact gnashed it jaws. ,books,ckjvdc2,4,t5_2qh4i

Look at the age of people in the US Revolutionary War link  So many of the people we think of as leaders and founders were in their twenties when the war began.The French Revolution is different as was mentioned in the OPs link because the wealthy people blocked the kings attempts at change then basically became the leaders of the rebellion against him.  So it was wealthy older men who were the leaders of that revolt.You are right though history is replete with these types of revolts.  Simple political machinations of powerfulwealthy people taking more powerwealth by leading a downtrodden lower class against the current leaderss.,books,ckjy728,40,t5_2qh4i

1966967,0,t3_2h7vkf,When your attention wanders you have to think about what its wander to and what its wandering from. Agreed? If you are typically not able to focus because you are thinking about television internet music the mess in your room people walking by texts from friends and so on you need to practice focus and find or make a better space for reading.If you are distracted from your book even when there is nothing in particular distracting you.... You can try a few tricks like using a bookmark or ruler to block out what youre not reading this focuses your eye on the right spot on the page. Or try reading out loud until you find the right pace  its hard to read a sentence out loud unless you are reading slowly enough to understand and remember it.. Overall most people need to read some books more slowly. Children who are reading their first YA books and young adults reading their first adult books are used to zipping along  its like driving  mph in a residential area after you get off the highway. You feel like youre going slowly but actually youre going way too fast.. And beyond that you may be reading books that are just too challenging for you. Try dropping down a tier to books aimed at a younger audience. Try short stories and essays. Try graphic novels.. Is it possible you just find the book youre reading boring? Not every book ever published is amazing. Try books by different authors try different genres.  If a book isnt gripping you you can also skip around in it and read passages at random. If they seem exciting and beautiful its worth trying again from the beginning if they seem dull and ugly find a new book.,books,ckq7ydx,3,t5_2qh4i

1972306,0,t3_2h8jf1,I think any text along the same lines as the Bible is worth a read. At a minimum an overview. I think no matter the text the impact they have had on history and mankind is undeniable and cannot be overstated. I think being familiar with the text makes literature very interesting. As you read the parallelism between those texts and other literary text is always interesting. I was raised in a Christian home went to catholic school so my biblical knowledge is there. When I read western literature making those connections helps me understand and connect with what Im reading. Through college and into adulthood I have continued to read and try to understand other religious texts. Reading these text and then reading literature from that region really adds another layer to my understanding enjoyment and the impact texts have on me.I highly suggest spending some time with various religious text and just familiarizing yourself with them. Many modern stories draw from religious stories and text be it characters or the overall theme.,books,ckqv3ep,4,t5_2qh4i

Its called The Adventure of the Two Collaborators and Doyle liked it so much that he included it in his autobiography. Its charming though definitively not canonical. You might be thinking of The Man Who Was Wanted. A man Arthur Whitaker approached Doyle with a fully written Holmes story hoping for a collaboration of some sort. Doyle paid him him ten pounds for the plot then never did anything. After Doyles death it was found among Doyles papers and printed across the world as a Long Lost Sherlock Holmes story. Really as much as Doyle could be cold toward Holmes he was very ready to sue anyone who used his creation. He sued Maurice Leblanc for instance for using Holmes in his Arsne Lupin stories. Leblanc didnt take this very well he imemdiately renamed Sherlock Holmes as Herlock Sholmes and used the Master detective regularly and repeatedly in his stories.Thanks to lax copyright laws Americans used Holmes as they wish.

1997718,0,t1_cktvzb6,I dont see where im illogical. You name it preference. But why does one prefer the one or the other? For certain reasons  and if these reasons are not rational it is an irrational act. Whats wrong with that? Im ready to revoke that that is an irrational decision in that moment when i hear some convincing arguments that come close to the weight of the arguments i gave. I dont claim to be nonemotional. I just say that the preferance of books is an emotional thing   which can be seen all over this thread. Ill give my opinion on your points by number.. Having no battery and no internet is practically not relevant to most people. It is enough to have it once per month for a day to get some books and recharge your battery. It is clearly a disadvantage but it should hardly play a role for anyone dont you think?. This is of course correct. Personally i dropped my eReader several times and it is fine. I have the impression that it is very robust  not comparable to a regular smartphone or tablet. And typically you will have a shell for it.. I dont really get that. My eReader does not get worse no matter what new devices come out. If you always have to have the newest best stuff then this point is valid. But that is a personal thing not a flaw of eReaders. I can read on an outdated device just as nicely as when it was not outdated. My eReader is actually quite outdated.. Depose surely. But you have to see the whole environmental picture. Just imagine what amounts of paper are preserved when  million ebooks are sold. And with that the whole production and transportation of the books too. Unless we can find sources for that in either direction we shouldnt use that argument right?. The Kindle is  and great. I bought mine for more and already saved hundreds of euros. So this is a difference but not a disadvantage. If you plan to only read  books on it it is a bad investment. If you read a lot you can save a lot of money.. That is correct and probably one of the biggest problems. Im not sure if you can sell your copy id think not. For me personally this is not a problem. As soon as i feel treated unfairly i can pirate. You can always disable your internet connection too. But if you avoid eReaders because of this thats fine and not irrational.The thing is most people prefer books because of the smell how the book feels how turning the pages feels and because they want to put them in shelves. And that is clearly irrational but very emotional. Dont you see that?,books,cktxb3o,2,t5_2qh4i

He then challenges the claim that suicide is the best answer in such a place this claim being made by those who find a world without purpose particularly one divinely given a shitty place to live by discussing the value of the search for meaning in and of itself.  He finishes by using the myth of Sisyphus as an example of finding peace of mind within the meaningless struggle.  While Sisyphus may be doomed to toil forever with his rock the fact that he exists to labor at all is a value to be treasured. ,books,ckwck3u,10,t5_2qh4i

Far from being illiterate they just process information better but in different ways aurally visually experientially. Unfortunately most educational systems are textbased even those that are practicumheavy. One way that you might be able to train your brain to print would be to read and listen to books at the same time. You could start with childrens books and move up from there. Amazon has their WhisperSync feature which enables you to listen and read both at the same time and alternate between the two formats bookmarking where you left off Or you could just pick up the print book and audio.

It bothers me a bit when people talk about working class as the default lowest socialfinancial position and associate it with benefits and degeneracy or at the very least socialcultural stuntedness.The working part is the key and to me working class is a functional but less affluent tier of society rather than a dysfunctional one or a drain on societyeconomy. Id posit that when people become noncontributing members or drains on societyeconomy they have dropped out of the functional contributing working class. It is probable that the working class is the one most likely to generate these people but rather than still calling them working class Id say they had dropped out of it.

The themes and the message are so simple but for someone suffering from depression of vast importance. Ive read it three summers in a row now and each time I find it helps me heal further.There is a truth that is deeper than experience. Its beyond what we see or even what we feel. Its an order of truth that separates the profound from the merely clever and the reality from the perception. Were helpless usually in the face of it. The cost of knowing it like the cost of knowing love is sometimes greater than any heart would willing to pay. It doesnt always help us to love the world but it does prevent us from hating the world.

It talks for a chapter about how things were before shipping containers came about and then later on talked about how it took so very long for shipping containers to catch on followed by the many different variations of it before a standardized version was decided on. Im not the best writer so I cant give a good review but if you are interested in this kind of stuff I suggest giving it a shot as the shipping container has had a huge impact on the world economy. ,books,cld51b1,2,t5_2qh4i

2155586,0,t1_cldsb6e,One differentiation that I might make Tolkien paints on a much bigger canvas from a literary standpoint but Lewiss works are IMHO far more detailed and expansive in their implications for Christian theology.  In Tolkiens world I think it would be fair to say that any central theological theme is broadly illustrated in the creation song of Eru and that the particulars of that theme are played out through all of the stories a narrative of beauty that is necessarily interwoven with pain suffering and death but that the narrative is consequently richer.  In Lewiss works however there are some fairly controversial issues that are being directly addressed from a relatively unorthodox viewpoint for example The Magicians Nephew deals with topics ranging from original sin predestination the creation of the soul and the fall of Satan and at least  of the others The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe The Silver Chair and The Last Battle deal with similarly thorny issues even though they are clothed in a childrens fiction series.,books,cldtofv,3,t5_2qh4i

In addition to overhead we had to take into account how likely anything was to sell. If something we saw every day that never sold went out at full half and we paid a good amount for it we would definitely be losing money. Even paying a dollar for something that goes on the clearance shelf at a dollar we would be unlikely to break even. Turnover for inventory was incredible and the reason we paid so little was often because we knew that what we were buying was literally going to be recycled at the end of the day.

I think many of your peers are hypersensitive to perceived slights to their chosen writing path and it often makes it impossible to have an honest conversation about any of it.For me the more ways of writing and reading the better.  I see selfpub as an addition to the field another way to spread stories though one with definite shortcomings.  Not a replacement for other publishers or booksellers or the whole culture around regular books  and yet a lot of people involved in selfpub do see it this way as a superior platform that will eliminate other traditional aspects of the industry.  I think thats where the friction comes in.I dont believe that being traditionally published is the only way to prove yourself as a writer.  Selfpublishing is a valid option for many writers and a hybrid approach can be ideal.  I do however think that as a reader I am more likely to enjoy work by someone who has gone through the process of tryfailtry the crucible which makes every artist become the best version of themselves.  The work is more likely to be successful because it has been labored over critiqued vetted edited labored over again in a symbiotic collaboration to create the best results.  Thats what publishing offers but it has somehow gotten a very bad rap lately partially because of issues with Amazon and I think thats undeserved.Anyway like I said I am in favor of all ways of writing and spreading good work and finding new stories.  Im an old punk and zinester so I am quite on board with the DIY angle.  But Im also a book lover and I want publishers to be able to continue doing what they do.  It would be nice if no one hated on anyone and everything could just exist.  But thats kind of a bigger human issue in general I guess.,books,clj3bxq,8,t5_2qh4i

2201204,0,t1_cljeu5r,Stand up isnt the first thing you need to do but its close.Oh and dont forget to look under the bed. It doesnt advance the plot one iota but I thought it was hilarious. One of the pleasures of the Infocom games was the many easter eggs lurking to be discovered if you paid attention.Lots of very inventive puzzles too. For example I loved the fact that for most of the time Arthur always had no tea as an item in his inventory. And that he also had a thing your aunt gave you which you dont know what it is that you never seemed to be able to get rid of. And yes I remember why in both cases and both were ingenious and fully in keeping with Adams quirky sense of humour and logic. And most of all I remember that it was the first text adventure game that deliberately lied to me  and made me laugh out loud when I realised that it had. But  as a game I never finished it. To solve it you needed to do something specific and to me at least nonobvious very early in the game to stop yourself getting unavoidably killed quite late  at which point after hours or days of effort and even if you realised at once what you needed to do which I most definitely didnt you had little choice but to start all over again. Even by the standards of the time that was pretty poor design. In the end I think I found a walkthrough somewhere and just followed it to enjoy as much of the experience as I could.,books,cljml38,1,t5_2qh4i

2240049,0,t1_cle0o3y,Thanks for your Response! Certainly if you define fantasy that way  which is a valid description  but its something more than fantasy  at least historically  One could also say that most of the major medieval epics and romances are also fantasy and that many of Icelandic Sagas are too  However they are constructed in a manner that is typically medieval and what I was trying to express is that Tolkien also constructed his oeuvre in manner similar to a medieval text and thats what sets it apart from what we usually call fantasy So I would say that Tolkien is narrative endeavor that was conceived more from medieval texts than anywhere else and that on the level of narrative structure although the current fantasy genre is indebted to Tolkien other authors have not done that he has done in terms of the medieval structure of his works. But cautioning against throwing fantasy out the window is well advised  thanks for the thoughtful reply!  ,books,clokaxc,2,t5_2qh4i

2325732,0,t3_2luvwa,Sometimes it could be the eyes. One of them may be uncoordinated making it difficult to focus. There are a few eye exercises that could help in a lot of different ways. The two basic one I would recommend are eye switches and tracking.Switches hold your thumbs out at arms length and separate them to a comfortable distance for your eyes to switch back and forth for about  sec at a time. Try different angles updown sideside diagonal or one finger close to your nose and the other out at a various angles. Tracking basically just follow your finger with your eyes in any and all directions. Or use a ball and toss it about while keeping eyes on it. Use one hand to hold your chin still as folks have a tendency to use their neck instead of their eyes.Be sure to rest your eyes as they are muscles. Cover them with both hands and block out all light until all the flashy negatives go black and you see only darkness. Then blink quickly for a short burst. This will help to reset them.All the best and happy eye training. ,books,clz69zd,1,t5_2qh4i

When I pointed this out and linked to other posts that do contain actual and severe spoilers you apparently reinstated my comment without acknowledging such and failed to remove the comments that I pointed out. You now claim its because spoilers are allowed when in fact my post never contained any to begin with.If your duty is to remove spoilers or warn others to not post them then you have failed miserably. Considering your inability to discern spoiler from nonspoiler Its evident that youre either unfamiliar with the story youre attempting to moderate and unaware of the fact that its  years old. You should know that you have no business moderating a topic when you use guess work to remove posts which do in fact comply with this subreddits rules.I highly suggest you review the rules and policies of this subreddit and adhere to them as you demand others do. Failure to do so will lead others to believe correctly that youre a hypocrite.gt if you arent happy with reddit.Strawman. rbooks doesnt represent all of reddit and its a bit conceited of you to imply that it does. There are a great many subreddits that have moderators whom are educated and knowledgeable about the subjects they are moderating.gt We all have obligations that take us away from reddit throughout the dayIf you dont have time to moderate the subreddit with care then perhaps you should wait until youre off work to do so. You hastily delete comments you feel are in violation even if theyre not. Thats a problem on your end not mine and your actions reflect poorly on rbooks in general.Deleting posts with insults? Sure. But deleting nonspoiler posts and then reinstating said nonspoiler posts by declaring spoilers okay is just absurd. You made a mistake I called you on it you refused to acknowledge said mistake I insulted you you reinstated my original post for a made up reason so you wouldnt look bad.If youre an example of moderators in this subreddit then I shall avoid this subreddit for the fact that its moderated in a willynilly fashion.

The problem is that in order to do this youd need to make a lot of assumptions that werent hinted in the film or the original story when the simplest and most likely explanation is that the director just imposed this dialogue on a setting which is easy to shoot.,books,cm3zkla,2,t5_2qh4i

2408514,0,t3_2n02bn,Massive rant ahead as I had a very similar childhoodSpeaking as someone who had major issues with ADD and Social Anxiety in school I definitely read books as an escape. That was not however the cause or contributing factor to the problem more just my way of making my life worth living when I faced criticism and headshaking from everyone around me and difficulty making new friends.Reading actually benefited me I filled my imagination with wonderful worlds and in these worlds I found people I liked and got to know them. I learned a lot about how people worked in general and I strongly believed that observing the characters in the books in terms of their friendships and romances helped my developing social skills.My problems continued through high school but towards the end I began to feel more comfortable around people and started getting out more. Eventually I grew out of my social anxiety and making great strides with my ADD.To the issue at hand regarding Kelly. I highly advise that you very strongly communicate to her mother that she should NOT force her daughter to read different books. This oversteps a boundary into a world that a parent has no call to intrude in no matter the age the childs interests and imagination to clarify parents should talk to their children about these things but they should not force anything on them in these regards.I can imagine no greater harm to her develop than controlling her in this way. Stifling her independent pursuit of her imagination can and will likely have farreaching effects on her personal growth. I would most definitely not want to be party to extinguishing a persons passion in this way.To the contrary I would advise that her parents and teachers support her passion for these books and focus on finding ways of reaching her through them. Her enthusiasm may one day lead her to doing great things that neither of us can foresee. Perhaps shell be an author herself but it doesnt stop there passion for reading can be a springboard to so many careers and lifepaths. Fiction provides you an insight into multitudes of different fictional peoples lives which can give you a taste of the different directions your life can take.In terms of her present issues instead of trying to blame them on something she chooses to do because quite often problematic children are not so by choice I would focus on exploring deeper into where she struggles. Has a psychiatrist or therapist considered a diagnosis of ADDADHD? These two can manifest very differently in people and can go uncaught for many years some people are diagnosed in their s and can be absolutely devastating to an otherwise bright childs academic success. Juvenile depression could also be at work here dont dismiss this possibility easily children can be surprisingly good at concealing feelings like these even from themselves. Although therapy can help both both are associated with physical brain abnormalities and as such medication can be the most effective treatment. Dont underestimate this fact meds can do wonders suddenly removing the fog from the victims mind.One idea I think may be very positive for helping her more evenly develop herself would be to seek out bookfantasy tv clubs within a reasonable distance that she can attend. My thought is that these would present an avenue in which she can work on her social skills in an environment of people with similar interests. She may flourish amongst true peers. If the only clubs are for an older agegroup I would still give them a shot. Perhaps have the parents meet with the person in charge explain that their younger daughter is really into fantasy novels but has difficulties making friends. She can still very much benefit from people older than herself maybe even moreso if she has grown suspicious of people her own age due to bullying. Of course I would make sure in that case that the clubs are operated in a public building and that her parents drop her off and pick her up right after each meeting.I very strongly do not believe that forcing her to read different novels will be of any help to her issues and in all likelihood drawing upon my very similar experiences in school will worsen them as she loses her one way of bringing joy into her life. She should not be reading at inappropriate times during lessons but I would not control her reading during her own time. She should be encouraged to use her free time to explore whatever constructive interests she has which includes reading. This is part of encouraging the development of children with independent and creative minds who are able to define the path their own learning takes.If the parents want some reassurance perhaps show them my post. I was much like their daughter when I was younger. I was distracted disorganized didnt excel academically except in English class big surprise eh   had trouble forming friendships and faced depression because of these issues. Reading was my escape but one that facilitated my eventual ability to overcome my problems. Without it or being forced to read genres I didnt like I dont know if Id have been half the man Ive grown to be.I am now  years old and attending college in an IT program. I have a parttime job in that field that pays me far more than minimum wage where I live and have plenty more ambition left in me. Although Im currently planning on pursuing a programming career I have an affinity for politics and activism someday when Im older I think Ill run for MP for my region as Id love to affect change in our world. Im still an introvert in many ways and proud to be so but am far more comfortable in groups and spend more time with the people I like. I didnt have any romantic relationships until I left high school but as I grew more comfortable around people I was more capable of pursuing the people I had feelings for. Ive dated on and off but Im content to be patient and wait for a person who inspires true love in me. I still have a lot of learning about myself and the world to do but Im on the right path.To put that in perspective my parents helped guide me in their own ways but they too realized that they couldnt force me to fix my problems. They mostly took a passive role supporting my personal pursuits enforcing the basic rules when I was younger homework must be done before video games etc but both actually took a step back. There were times where it may have seemed to them as if they had failed but with my own course set I gradually flourished into the healthier independent person I am today. Not everyone takes the same road nor is the road paved for everyone. Some people experience many bumps and stray from it but I learned the same lesson my parents did I must ultimately find my own guidance.,books,cm9egf6,7,t5_2qh4i

Whether its because you get distracted discouraged or just busy with other things its horribly easy to just stop writing for weeks or even months at a time. I was recently sitting next to the great crime novelist Bruce DeSilva at an author event and he gave me some excellent advice that Ill pass along to you Think of writing as your primary job whether it is or not and if you dont want to get fired you need to write  words every day. If you get those  words done before breakfastgreat you have all day to do other things.

Holding a book turning the pages the exquisite smell of old books.But I have to admit that I adore my kindle. Especially as I moved half way around the world and couldnt bring my book collection with me! Its so handy to have all your books all the time. Ereaders are so much lighter and thinner too so theyre a god send if like me you enjoy reading big thick fantasy books that are a pain to carry around. Another feature of my kindle that I love dont know if other makes have it is the ability to highlight a word and get its definition. Before if I was reading and didnt know a word Id usually just keep reading and forget about it. I also do think I read more as its a lot easier to carry around an ebook and also its a lot easier to read in bed! I usent read in bed often as I like to read lying down on my side and it was often difficult and uncomfortable to hold a book like this and a pain to turn the pages. No longer! My kindle is touchscreen and thin enough to be held in one hand. I now read before going to sleep every night. In terms of a browser I dont think its needed. If my kindle had a browser Id probably read less as Id get sucked into the internet instead of reading. TLDR Get one. ,books,cmgsmjy,14,t5_2qh4i

2492320,0,t3_2o55gv,As a German WHAT? THE? FUCK?  To start off my little rant LOTR is a beautifully written and has a strange hypnotic quality but is BY FAR not the zenith of the English language. Check this out used it for the eulogy to my father    And death shall have no dominion.  Dead men naked they shall be one  With the man in the wind and the west moon  When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone  They shall have stars at elbow and foot  Though they go mad they shall be sane  Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again  Though lovers be lost love shall not  And death shall have no dominion.    Dylan Thomas    I love this poem not only because of the onomatopoeia bones are picked clean and the dreamlike quality but because of the countless references Man in the Wind and the West Moon as a conflation of man in the moon and wind in the west the nearly biblical language in parts stars at elbow and foot and of course the rythm death shall have no dominion.  And this is just ONE example of a rich multicontinent language history spanning from the courts of kings that never were to the Indian subcontinent all the way to the Americas resulting in a diversity that no other language on earth can match.  An example You have good command of German if you have a working vocabulary of about  words. In contrast you have a good command of English if you have a working vocabulary of about  !!!!! words cromulent words such as serendipity portentous propitiousness and discombobulation.  An aphorism I try to imbue with traction is English is one of the easiest languages to speak badly yet one of the hardest languages to speak well meaning that its apparent grammatical simplicity belies the incredible richness and nuancedness of possible expression.  Judging by your post you still speak English very very very badly so I shall let reason cool my intemperate heart and forgive your transgression. But please. Do yourself a favour and learn English. It is without doubt one of the most beautiful rich and flexible languages possibly THE most rich on this planet.  Regarding people not making full use of English alas you are not choosing the right company it seems. Hang out in an English dept. once in a while? Or go to a reading drama society? Basically dont hang out with idiots I have studied this language for over  years and still I find people use words I have never heard on a DAILY basis. To close    And if perchance I have offended  Think of this and All is mended  MOVE BITCH GET OUT THE WAY GET OUT THE WAY GET OUT THE WAY!

2509453,0,t1_cmlxh4l,gtVery little interpretation is actually done by the students  most of it is memorize an interpretation regurgitate on command and try to suppress the memory of both the book that became an intellectual forced march and the instruction that accompanied it.Isnt this sort of true of everything in education though? Why must English classes be fun and leisurely? I dont think Ive ever heard people say that math or science classes killed their enjoyment of those.gtRegarding the author the problem that by saying it means  youre essentially putting words or at least meaning in the authors mouthNot really. Youre saying that you came to X conclusion based on the words in the book. If the writer is upset with whatever your interpretation is frankly a stupid reaction to literary analysis then some of the blame is on them for leading you in that direction.gtAs for there being only one answer youd have to ask that of the teachers and academics who do the interpretation and the teaching of this interpretation. But Ill bet you that if you go against the interpretation provided in the instructors manual youre not going to get a very good grade most of the time.I did this all the time in honorsAP classes in high school. English was always my best subject. Im an English major now and still do this and am still getting very good grades.,books,cmm4gvn,1,t5_2qh4i
2512922,0,t3_2of37z,I understand what youre saying. Unless you have an issue being seen with a YA book there may be some reasonable cause for your hesitation. The books are written for a specific audience and while decent in many aspects such as overall structure narrative and gravity of certain content the main characters get annoying with their immaturity and audiencespecific cool factors at times. If you can stomach that then theyre decently well written and at least the first few books were a nice read. The last two were only alright when I read them. I dont necessarily recommend them but if youre interested go for it.,books,cmmksr4,0,t5_2qh4i

2517036,0,t3_2nxr4d,I read the Xanth series when I was in high school. I liked it so much I went on to read everything Piers Anthony has ever written. Now I admit that he has continued writing Xanth books for many years after I have outgrown them and I have long since stopped reading them. That said I have found many other gems in his catalog. Without going into specific novels and series I liked I think at this point I can speak to what I find enjoyable about his writing that is pervasive across everything he writes. What always drew me into the Xanth novels was his ability to make me feel empathy for the main character. His writing is easy to read. He does not present a complicated tale that requires a lot of effort to decipher. Some people may be turned off by this but I think it is brilliant.  By presenting a clear and simple view of the world as seen by the characters in the story it enables the reader to feel what the characters are feeling. This is an incredibly difficult thing to do in any medium and he does it consistently many of his different series and novels. One series where this kind of empathetic ability is actually a plot element is the Bio of a Space Tyrant series. The main character Hope has his special talent which is based on extreme empathy. He can read people and understand their desires and motivations. It is a bit meta but it seems to me that PA is calling out this ability to communicate motivations that he has and using it as a device for his main character. That seems to imply to me that the empathetic elements in his writing are very much the result of a conscious effort. The other thing I like about PAs books and series are his bad guys. They are not evil. They inevitably are regular people forced to make difficult decisions. You see this over and over again. Of course Hope from the aforementioned Bio of a Space Tyrant is this type of person. We follow along with his life and career and see the decisions he makes which seem reasonable in the moment but in the end he becomes the Tyrant. Similarly for Trent who is initially the villain in A Spell for Chameleon. Initially Bink has this image of him as evil and cruel but as time goes by he learns that much of what he thought was true is false.,books,cmn44qu,1,t5_2qh4i

I started reading Beyond Good and Evil and I was never sure what his stance was because he seemed to convincingly build an argument hook the reader and then negate everything.  I loved this about BGE.  As to what you plan to read before him?  Thus Spoke Zarathustra is great because its aphorisms though at times it can be convoluted as well.

It is based in the moments when I take them in how I interpret them through my own filters and how I can relate them to my own life. It has absolutely nothing to do with the creator of that art. They may have conflicting views or do horrible things. But if I can take something positive or have a sense of personal growth through their creation then why would I deny myself that. Let yourself be your own decider as you take in a piece of work dont let anyone else tell you what to think before the fact.Also some of my favorite works are made by assholes.BooksGrowth of the Soil by Knut Hamsun  Author supported the Nazis in Norway and this was one of Hitlers favorite books. And it is beautiful read. Almost all of Hamsuns are classics. Anything by Bukowski  That guy could craft passions out of the must mundane and profane. He was also a wife beater and a drunk. Amazing prose. Yukio Mishima Japanese author who tried to start a cult and take over the country. Heartbreakingly beautiful books. MusicJohn Lennon He was a colosal asshole cheated on his wives and abused them. One of the greatest songwriters of the th century. Charles Manson Psycopathic cult leader and murderMade a wonderful offkilter folk album. Burzum Killed a man. Is a massive antisemite and racist. Kinda of the best Black Metal ever.

2570512,0,t1_cmu2dn2,gt Do you understand what I mean when I say abridged?Yes I understand what you mean. But even by cutting half of the series youd be left with  books that would be each as large as two of LoTRs books. Do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?gt There was so much pointless and useless filler in those books There is a difference to be made between the issue of the writing tics that you cited and that we all know and hate especially when they appear three times a page. This is a clear drawback of bypassing any serious edition.But the issue of descriptions slow pacing and entire books with little happening is not filler. Filler is by definition madeup stuff added later to fluff out a slim story. This is not at all the case here RJ just wrote as he liked to write the way he intended from the start. To quote his letter to George RR Martins editorI see in Locus that George says he no longer thinks he can finish the story in a trilogy. Good. Not that his story will be longer but that he isnt going to try shoehorning his story into the form everybody seems to say such stories must follow. Writing what you want to write in the way you want to write it isnt easy when lots of people are telling you that you cant do it that way because it isnt done that way. He apparently is as lucky as I am in having a publisher and editor who are willing to go against the flow.Now it is perfectly understandable that many people will hate reading a seemingly neverending series of descriptions especially if you started reading in the beginning and had to wait for the next book to finally be disappointed because the story dragged on. But some people love that and I for one love reading the unabridged version the one the author wanted to write.Dismissing the slow pace and the amount of descriptions as filler is pure speculation on your part. Nothing points to that especially knowing that he was running out of time and could not finish his series.,books,cmu3rdo,1,t5_2qh4i

It wouldnt make any sense for Diondra to choose Ben over Trey in Dark Places otherwise...Ben can be controlled manipulated Trey has too much will of his own.  I think Nick really wants to be the hero of his own story a good guy in his own mind which is why he a doesnt kill Amy and b stays to watch over his babyspoiler  Some people are just born not wanting to rock the boat.

I loved both places loved book stores.However I love the internet more. I read the the reviews and enjoy them and I have found many cherished authors this way and I think it is much easier to find books I will enjoy this way rather than the old way of browsing reading the flap copy and taking a chance. Back in those days I subscribed to the New York Times Book Review and Publishers Weekly and finding a book I could avidly devour was still a crap shoot. I also like the ability to spend a . on an author I havent heard of  if the books sucks at least I didnt pay . for a paperback. Even the HBs at Amazon that sell for a penny are double that price with the shipping.There is no way my local or even county library can match the on line selection.I hope libraries and some book stores survive I truly do but I like the new way better.,books,cmx1m7l,2,t5_2qh4i

Gettysburg for example fails the Bechdel test which makes sense considering female soldiers werent allowed in the US at that time period.Regardless the Bechdel test is not supposed to be used to judge the quality of a single piece of media.  Its supposed to be used to identify trends against an entire genre or even entire media. If the Expendables  has an all male cast thats not entirely a bad thing.  But if a the vast majority of films in any given year fails the Bechdel test then that points to a problem in variety and representation across the whole industry.,books,cmxquky,3,t5_2qh4i

We would probably have a pretty shitty system if teachers had the right to set curriculums for their classes. Hell my science teachers basically wanted to skip evolution aside from half a minute discussion. This was a little over  years ago. Who cares what they teach in a college curriculum? If YOUVE chosen the responsibility to learn at a college level then its absolutely your job to expose yourself to a diverse array of literature.The real responsibility is to get shitheads out of the Texan Education System. Maybe if the US K education was a bit more competitive we wouldnt have to worry about college students being Underexposed. ,books,cn3a2d4,2,t5_2qh4i

2655716,0,t3_2qdms6,You cannot possibly know every word ever used in every book ever written  is that sentence annoying or clever or stupid...sorry back to topic. Many words used in writing stories are just not words we use when talking  most people dont say Im pondering for example they just say Im thinking or Im seriously considering meh they usually dont say that second one either. Talking is very different because tone and facial expression and even body posture convey lots of things we dont even think about but affect how we understand a person. In books you have to carefully consider the words youre using to try and get across all those things. You can read dictionaries I guess but the simplest way is just keep reading. Read everything you can. Look up the words you dont know  but first try to figure them out from the context of the story.You will improve both your vocabulary and your ability to figure meanings out on your own. A fun thing also is  when you learn a new word make sure you use it correctly in a sentence during the next  hours.When I was a kid walking with my parents one day I told them we were trudging along and they laughed and wondered where I got that word.

2666848,0,t1_cn6jhpa,As an English major I may not have had an emotional connection to books I read for class depending on the book but definitely Ive always had an emotional connection to any good book I read. I agree that it might be the type of books that OP is reading. I enjoy Dickens and I got really into the plot of say Our Mutual Friend but I wasnt really that into it emotionally. A lot of classics I find are more interesting for their style interest etc rather than causing me any emotional joy or sadness. If OP is interested in developing that emotional reaction I would suggest trying to go for books that are aiming for that emotional reaction  stay away from purely literary type fiction nothing wrong with it but often the focus IS more on the words the construction the ideas rather than emotions. Young adult books might be more openly emotional. THink about what gets you feeling emotional in real life  thats probably where youll find the most connection. For example I didnt really feel very sad in The Fault In Our Stars spoiler alert its a sad book partly because I checked the end to see who would die so I didnt get attached to them didnt feel like crying. I also just didnt really like the characters and knew they were doomed from the start so I dont like that kind of thing. In If I Stay there is a scene with a grandfather thats quite sad to me which made me cry mostly because of how I feel about MY grandfather. Other books that make me cry are often because of the death of an animal dog or horse. So think about what makes you emotional in real life and aim for books that kind of deal with that maybe? I guess Ive only been talking about sad emotions but also things that excite you make you happy find characters following the same life goals as you so you can follow along vicariously? Books about people in the same professions as you? You have to find that thread that makes you relate to it! ,books,cn6ok7n,3,t5_2qh4i

The Poker Broker on Robert Moses is probably the best but if you have not spent any time living in the NYC area some of the neighborhood specific stuff may be lost on you.As to the LBJ books Master of the Senate is the best with its lead in on how the old Senate worked so you got an understanding  context of what LBJ was able to accomplish. I would say Means of Accent is the weakest book just because it spends s of the time talking about one LBJ senate race. But that might very well be your subject of choice. The first and third books were great but may have too much detail to entertain everyone.  I would definitely recommend reading them in order if you think you have the time.,books,cncz1oz,1,t5_2qh4i

2729384,0,t3_2ravyn,I never really thought that this book was written soley about slavery.  Each chapter Twain writes seems to point to injustic in several social settings or musings of personal belief systems.There is one section of the book I remember well.  It was when Huck met this lady who always clipped out the obituarys and talked about people dieing one way or another.  I remember Huck thinking this woman would be happier dead than alive as her interest in death was so prominent.  This observation wasnt color related.Another non color issue was child abuse and leaving the reader to ponder the circumstances that may cause this.  We know that Hucks father was a drunk and beat him.  He know that Hucks rebellious nature came from this life.  Having little to no family life considered as normal Hucks defense was becoming fiercely indepentant and questioning everything around him.  This was Twain using a character to question common social beliefs.  Twain wrote this tale to highlight the injustices in our world.  Huck admired the run away slave because he saw someone doing something that he believed in.  Instead of just grumbling Jim acted to relieve his misery.  Huck was impressed but at the same time Huck was a product created by the current social beliefs of his time.  Thus the language is harsh but at the time it was acceptable the same way we shorten the phrase sucks today but yesterday it was considered very harsh.Twain used a story to highlight the evils of slavery cruelty child abuse the evils of addiction preconcieved ideas without thought criminal acts within our society and peoples lack of common sense and the evils that come with it. This book is a champion of free thought.  And it should be read that way.,books,cnebidt,20,t5_2qh4i

Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion he saw it as a human act of becoming a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day by the will and the intelligence and the heart.In his fortythird year William Stoner learned what others much younger had learned before him that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.,books,cnehbsx,1,t5_2qh4i

2739502,0,t1_cnfehd2,True but I see it as this for personal reasons He like me comes from a Narcissistic family. His father is the Narc his sister is the Golden Child his Brother is the Scapegoat. As the child who not only ruins his fathers image of the personal family but the one who killed his wife Who I no doubt Tywin viewed as a possession like he does his children the bastard. Had all of his fathers and later his siblings failings projected onto him repeatedly his entire life. His fathers failure to be the head of a perfect family is constantly projected onto the son that is the most obvious deviation from his definition of perfect. His sisters failures as a monarch are projected onto him by being forced to take the blame for all of her failings while being the hand. To the point that the public blames him rather than her for the food shortage. And his brother is the constant reminder of what the perfect son should be who is only his friend and treats him like person because no one else will. And even then Jaimie is willing to abuse his brother with the rest of them. For what? Being different in a way he has no control over. Would that not drive you to be horrible and mean to your family? Jamie deserved to be told his died the way he did or at least I cant sympathize with him after having just told Tyrian that he had helped his father lie to Tyrion about his wife then allow her to be gang raped by his guard then mind fucked Tyrion into joining in. At . Lets not forget. Who hurt who more? Can you blame him for wanting to get a dig in? Tyrion may be cruel and twisted. But he wasnt born that way. Treat someone like a monster long enough and they become one. And on top of that lets not forget his many acts of kindness both in the books and in the show. His moments of brilliance of courage and his moments of self control. Given all that hes been through he could be a lot worse of an individual.,books,cnfgx6c,4,t5_2qh4i

2760086,0,t3_2rlgx0,Ive read Enders Game and Enders Shadow. I really liked EG although I guessed the ending but I didnt like ES as much. To be fair there are many people that liked ES better such as the person I bought the book from at a yard sale and it isnt a bad book. It fleshes out some of the characters from EG a bit more and explains away some minor loopholes from EG. ES even sets up a new enemy at the end for the sequels to deal with.The major problems with ES in my opinion were twofold in the first place the story took place in parallel with EG and ended at about the same time. So if you were already familiar with the major plot twist of EG then it wont surprise you at all in ES or viceversa. But the second far larger issue IMO is that it suffers from something I like to call the Foundation Effect after the Issac Asimov series. In Foundation we see the Empire crumble and the power vacuum filled by the Foundation. The Foundation was thus the new power in the galaxy. But wait! Then the Mule comes along and throws a wrench into everything by being a factor that Seldon didnt account for. We then find out major plot twist that its really the Second Foundation pulling all the strings after they come in and fix everything.If Asimov had quit there after the first three books then it would have been a great series. But his publisher forced him to write two more books. So hang on! The Second Foundation? Theyre having their strings pulled by Gaia! Gaia? Their having their strings being pulled by a  year old robot from Earth! But wait! There might be aliens from other galaxies out there! How deep does this rabbit hole go anyway?I found it annoying by the end of book  of the Foundation series that there was always another power group behind the scenes running the show. Thats why it bothered me to find out that one of the characters from ES was influencing things in EG more then we knew. I think that Card did this to make his new character seem cool but to me it just seemed boring at best and derivative at worst. Card even cites his love for the Foundation series in a forward to EG and mentions what an influence it had on that book.Its hard to write a book about the same event through the perspective of a different character and have it be fresh and interesting. To pull it off you usually need a fresh character with a very different outlook on life and set of motives. But when both major protagonists from EG and ES have essentially the same or similar motives and when the radically different backgrounds that they have dont contribute in a significant way to the plot or the development of their characters then I have a hard time being interested in the overall story.,books,cnht7ig,1,t5_2qh4i

2831136,0,t1_cnpvcu9,Right and there have been numerous improvements towards bundling.  You dont have to give publishers kudos if you dont want to but they dont deserve disparagement either.To say bundling has been solved is a bit simplistic.  First forget movies and music  there are no analogies to be made there.  Different industries different obstacles different user experiences.  As far as Amazon Matchbook it does what many publishers were already doing.  It just gets more attention because Amazon is such a ubiquitous distribution presence though there is very little participation.  Its unclear what the success of the matchbook program will ultimately be  it addresses a certain need and expands printing opportunities for KDP writers but it also contributes to the erosion of valueperception which Amazon is notorious for e.g. the flatebook rate fiasco of last year the ongoing denial of publisher costs.  I think it will end up being mostly a tool for indie writers to get print copies out more easily since they are already lockedin to Amazon distribution.

2888975,0,t3_2t75h4,Im not sure your statement that Joyce hated Catholicism is quite accurate. He was raised as a Catholic in devoutly Catholic Ireland. He went to a Jesuit school and was even approached about joining the Clergy like Dedalus in Portrait. While he moved away from the Church as he grew older it still had a major impact and role on his life. It would be impossible for him to accurately write about Dublin and the lives of the people that live there without writing about Catholicism. Dedalus obviously talks about Catholicism mockingly in many cases throughout the novel since he is a representation of a young Joyce. Bloom a Jew deals with Catholicism daily in Dublin and it would of course have a profound impact on him and his status as an outsider. Without the many references to the Church Joyce could not have accomplished what he did in Ulysses. It is vitally important to the alienation of the two main characters provides a consistent undercurrent for nearly every interaction they have. Joyces weekly attendance at mass or lack thereof has nothing to do with the role Catholicism played in his life and the lives of every person living in Ireland. ,books,cnwha2b,1,t5_2qh4i

2895282,0,t3_2t75h4,Its been a long time since Ive last read Ulysses so dont be too hard on me oYes Joyce didnt like Catholicism at all. But I think that at the start of the th century religion played a much larger role than it does today. There was just no escape possible and one way or another this will be reflected into his work.What strikes me most however when thinking of religion and Ulysses is that it is conceptually and structurally totally different from a truly religious work such as Dantes Divine Comedy.It has been said many times before that Ulysses is a work of such depth and detail that it would be possible to recreate the whole of Dublin in  from this book. You could say that Dublin is contained in the DNA of Joyces Ulysses. Similarly Dante in his Divine Comedy paints a very detailed picture of contemporary Florence and Italy in general. Giving a very vivid picture of Italy in .However the main difference as I see it is in the worldview of these two works. Dantes is a thoroughly Christian worldview God unfolds time from the Creation to the Last Judgement. Everything that happens in between stands in relation to God Dante beautifully describes this concept in Paradiso XXXIII as Gods Book of Nature of which the leaves are scattered throughout the universe but in the proper light can be seen as one single volume containing the whole of human history events etc. Ulysses however is totally different. Yes it is structurally related to the Odyssey but there is no allencompassing bubble. There is no alpha to omega. Its openended not enclosed in an ideology.,books,cnx749k,1,t5_2qh4i

He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zooborn animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun while all around new sounds are waking.He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise.He hadnt realized that life speaks with a voice to you a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before which was Yes.And we had our brothers being Calvin and Hobbes too,books,co1j8wx,31,t5_2qh4i

Its hard enough getting people to donate towards causes that matter in the world.That aside crowdsourcing in general is problematic.  It has been abused too much either by companies who have no business asking for superfluous funding or by amateurs who lack the capability and followthrough to deliver on promises.  It has the potential to give life to great projects and occasionally it does  but like selfpublishing itself it is also often used out of laziness inexperience impatience and ineptitude.Do not ask strangers on the internet to pay you to write a book.

His masters thesis in anthropology for the University of Chicago which was rejected because it was so simple and looked like too much fun.gtgtVonnegut readily admitted that he was a miserable anthropology student. In fact if his account of history is to be believed Vonneguts Shapes of Stories proposal is one of at least two theses rejected during his pursuit of a masters degree. According to Vonnegut the university turned down another thesis on the necessity of accounting for the similarities between Cubist painting and lateth Century Native American uprisings claiming it was unprofessional.gtgtVonnegut as was previously mentioned left school in  to work for GE. Fourteen years later UChicago accepted Vonneguts novel Cats Cradle as his thesis and awarded him the M.A. degree based on the anthropological basis of his novels..Im certain he had a body of work to accompany the diagrams but the content matter was lacking.

It really is a good story and the writing is good although a bit too th century man of science for my taste.

3128439,0,t1_com8wws,gt as any erotica selfpublisher will tell you its a much bigger audience than people realize and quality is never the primary concernThis is the thing really. Theres a lot of focus on how something so terrible got so big when quality isnt really relevant. It got big because it was the first erotica that got the chance to go properly mainstream. It could have happened to any erotic novel really once people who were interested saw it as something that they could acceptably be open and proud to read. You raise a good point about publishers as businesses and also cultural purveyors. I suppose the answer would be the same as what people say about big blockbusters  theyre somewhat necessary in order to provide money for the better quality stuff thats not going to sell quite as well. Fifty Shades is an interesting example because it wasnt something a publisher took a shot on  it was doing fantastically well as a selfpublished book and at that point it was just a case of snapping it up with hype and audience already attached.

3129309,0,t1_com6kz7,On his Wikipedia articlegt The most oftcited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it. These were not his words but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her  biographical book The Friends of Voltaire. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaires attitude towards Claude Adrien Helvtius and his controversial book De lesprit but her firstperson expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaires attitude towards Helvetius it had been said Halls summary was inspired by a quotation found in a  Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche in which he was reported to have said I detest what you write but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write. Nevertheless scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.gt Voltaires first major philosophical work in his battle against linfme was the Trait sur la tolrance Treatise on Tolerance exposing the Calas affair along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras for example by the Jews the Romans the Greeks and the Chinese. Then in his Dictionnaire philosophique containing such articles as Abraham Genesis Church Council he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets Voltaire criticized Frances colonial policy in North America dismissing the vast territory of New France as a few acres of snow quelques arpents de neige.I think the important point from that bit is that Hall was trying to summarize Voltaires position and apparently did so even though Voltaire didnt write such phrase.,books,comcmym,69,t5_2qh4i

3175306,0,t1_coqscek,Its honestly nothing more than a completely indecipherable mess to me. Punctuation serves a purpose and thats to stress certain phrases and words. Punctuation creates rhythm creates voice and can even make some prose poetic in a sense. Im honestly wondering what kind of boring person trudges through this trash? Even after trying to edit it and put some punctuation in there it becomes even more evident that some of the phrasing is almost incoherent. I can barely make sense of it.  As he turned to go he heard the train. He stoppedhe waited.       He could feel it under his feet. It came    boring out of the east like    some rabid satellite of the coming sunhowling and bellowing in the distance. The long light of the headlamp running through the tangled mesquite breaks creating out of the night the endless fenceline down the dead straight right of waysucking it back again. Wire and post mile on mile into the darkness after where the boilersmoke disbanded slowly along the faint new horizon.

3208354,0,t1_couikfb, amp  Colour of MagicLight Fantastic Great intro to the world of the Disc. I enjoyed the tale though the pacing for book  was a bit too slow for the first quarter of the book. Took me a while to finally break that barrier. Enjoyed the books far more than the film which I saw before reading them. Equal Rites Great book. Loved the look into the world of Witches and Granny Weatherwaxs somewhat backward view of the rest of the world. Also loved Esk and hope that somewhere along the lines shes given more story Ill even take to the YA novels if I have to. So far Ive noted that later books Sourcery and Wyrd Sisters in particular seem to act as if the events from this one had never happened. Mort I read Mort first several years ago after seeing the CoM and Hogfather TV movies and I watched those after being introduced to Discworld via playing the AnkhMorpork boardgame. This book really made me love Death as a character and I truly loved the tale overall. After reading this book I vowed that I needed to read them all. I decided I had to go in publishing order because Ive read reviews on how TPs style evolves and you kind of ease into it as you go. So far its worked out well. Sourcery I liked the concept but didnt like this books tale as much as the previous few. In fact I think its dead last in the  Ive read. I didnt like the main character got bored with the other wizards and their interactions with him. Rincewind was great of course as was The Librarian. It was about this time too that I kind of got tired repeated things like explanations on the world of the Disc. I get that for some people this may be their first book in the series but I found the inclusion of a description of ATuin or how the Librarian became an orangutan for what felt like the th time to be annoying. I was probably just looking for excuses to dislike the book at that point. Probably need to reread it at some point and might do that when I get another  books into the series. Wyrd Sisters Another Witches book and I liked it a lot... Enough so that I bought the Witches board game I got the Collectors Edition because I now recognized characters in the game from the books. The tale itself was decent though I think a better familiarity with Shakespeare would probably have offered an even better experience.

3218748,0,t1_cov5fcy,Sure! Im going to give examples from what Ive been reading lately because I dont actually know the names of the ones I was told as a child and I cant really retell them with any skill. Yet.So the central story from The Snowy Tower is a pretty decent example. Its the story of Parzival an old old version of it. Youve probably heard parts of it already if you like the King Arthur mythos there hes called Sir Percival. Heres a link to a pretty good version of the story Now I say pretty good. Its not super and the reason I prefer Martins version is because this reads more like a book. That isnt to say its bad but it doesnt quite fill the roles Im talking about when I was talking about a nonmonolithic story. It is pretty good at the first part of that narrative though. Namely it shows us that Parzival is a fuckup. In his life he starts doing everything before hes ready for it much like we do and it leads to him being in trouble of one sort or another much like us. What I feel this leaves out and what I feel needs to be there is the strong connection that the characters who correct him have to nature. Kundrie and Fierefiz his brother are both strange in a way that is profoundly unhuman. Kundrie literally has animal traits boarbristle hair tusks lionclaws. Fierefiz has as I recall strong crow or magpie attributes as opposed to his almost complete uninvolvement in this version of the story. Also youll note something in the later third or so of the linked tale a magical Writing that prompts the plot forward by handing out knowledge. In the story I know the instructive characters have learned what needs to be done by going out and doing things and having adventures not that we hear about or that steal the spotlight it is simply known that they have lives outside of what they are doing now. They are key to Parzivals story but they clearly exist beyond it. Thats part of what I mean when I say nonmonolithic. In a ton of fairy tales everyone exists to help the protagonist. But in a myth that stays closer to its roots that connects people to the world around them theres a tacit understanding that the protagonist is only the protagonist of their story and that there are uncountable other stories going on around them in which they have no part. I think awareness of that truth is important and I think its sorely absent in much of literature let alone myth and fairy tale.,books,covmis7,2,t5_2qh4i

3222901,0,t1_covh83v,Id ignore the shitty editorialized write up and focus on the actual work and quote from the creator.This strikes me as a comment on the fragility of books as a medium. Its trying to portray a future in which physical books have been discarded completely in favor of electronic formats. Its as if the books of the world have been shoved off into a cave somewhere and left long enough for stalactites to form on the ceiling and crystals to grow on the pages that once held so much information and knowledge. Now imagine stumbling into this cave and seeing these objects having never once seen an actual paper book. Its kind of an epitaph for a medium that will likely go extinct at some point in the future. You know that quote the medium is the message? Theres something poetic about the use of books as a medium in visual art to decry the loss of books as a medium for written word.Oh and all that bullshit about The crystals remove the text and transform the books into aesthetic nonfunctional objects is really just saying that at the end of the day regardless of its commentary that the results turn out looking pretty sweet by themselves.,books,cow21y5,7,t5_2qh4i

I mentioned this a few weeks ago on rbooks  the Celine Dion vs Beethoven approach. Beethoven gives me chills and so if Celine Dion does that for you then were having the same reaction to different works of art. I could give reasons why I think Celine Dion isnt as good based in music theory for e.g. but if she moves you then by all means keep listening and who cares what I think. Yeah?As far as personal quest books go...? There are many but of course my mind goes blank when I have to list them now.Lord of the Rings isnt that far off this theme although for Frodo unlike the Alchemist he can never really go home again. Herman Hesses books all take this on in what for my tastes seems far less trite and cliched. Jack Kerouacs early novels. Life After God by Douglas Coupland. Bird in the House by Margaret Laurence.

3309807,0,t1_cp5j6a9,I lost steam in the nd book and was still trying to decide if the rd was worth reading  thanks for the headsup maybe Ill skip it. It seemed such a forced romance like we readers were supposed to automatically buy into them as a noble tragic RomeoJuliet pair in this heartbreaking againstallodds romance... when really theyd just had some hot sex. Which was hot and all but I was completely unconvinced there was anything other than simple lust there. I didnt buy that there was any other connection between them. In that regard it was very like the Kingkiller books actually The demon chick was hot and... she was hot and... really all there was to her character was shes really hot. Oh and shes a bitch but shes HOT so nothing else about her matters. Frustrating because I liked the premise the books started with. Tad Williams sometimes really hits the mark amazingly well I really adore the Otherland series but other times he just seems to stamp out a formulaic series just for the hell of it. This was aimed very much at the Dresden Files  Supernatural audience.

This came at just the right time for me Id been thinking about how so far Huck had been like Theseus or some other Greek hero on a journey  and here we suddenly are in the company of gods. Sure theyre immediately and unsurprisingly revealed to be gibbering mummies boys  but thats ok too because it picks up on Hucks presentation of him and Jim as heroes and what it is exactly that we make out of lived experience.,books,cp827ho,1,t5_2qh4i

3333292,0,t1_cp85zbe,I havent read much from the noir genre but I find the genre fascinating because there was a unique language to the many interactions that each character had with one another ranging from a certain novels hardboiled character to its femme fatale. Im thinking that the presentation of smoking in noir is a way of reflecting each characters anger at the world around them and in this novel characters possibly smoke because they are upset at everything going on around them and are questioning the many plagiarism scandals taking place. I also think that Gaddis use of smoking is drawn from the fact that the author was a very heavy smoker when he was alive. Gaddis smoking is mentioned in this article about a class he taught on The Literature of Failure which was a class that explored the ideas of success and failure in American culture  whether failures in one peculiar American sense were successes in some broader way. The class was required to read twelve books one a week with two short papers throughout the semester and a final long paper due at the end of the semester.

In Kaladins next scene he indicates that the run was a successSadeas was able to get the gemheart. They won the day. In one of Dalinars scenes where the plateau known as the Tower is first discussed Dalinar indicates that never has anyone won a gemheart at the Tower. In a later chapter Kaladin indicates that his very first plateau run was at the Tower.So we have a conflictKaladin says his first plateau run at the Tower resulted in Sadeas getting a gemheart.

3379225,0,t3_2yvvfr,This is not a yes or no question. It depends more on you. If Hitler holds some macabre fascination for you than there are a millionandone books that document the facts of his life and speculate on his psychological world view. If you are interested in the victim mentality the fascinating observation that almost everyone views themselves as the underdog struggling in a world out to get them it might be interesting for you to read in Hitlers own words what he thought about himself and the world around him. If youre just attracted to owning or reading controversial censored graphic or otherwise forbidden knowledgebooks than there are far more interesting tomes to read seeing as how Hitler only gives opinions and critiques in his book knowing it would be published and wanting to influence the reader. I would instead recommend buying books that summarize the recent US Government torturemurder scandal leaks. You can also visit an academic library if you have a nearby state university. There you can access journals and books that deal with every depth of controversial subject matter such as criminal justice books that will fully explain the drug trade starting with how the drugs are made from every day items to the various methods used to operate covertly and that is just  a tame example  of the insane amount of easily abused information just sitting around in college libraries which you are allowed to access just as much as students and faculty because your taxes helped pay to keep that state university library open. And finally if you are interested in reading Mein Kompf as a literary pursuit or wanting to know if you will walk away a better or more informed person the answer is generally no but obviously that is subjective. The book is not well written and is unfocused as well as disorganized. A lot of the terminology is dated as well the political social and literary views. So again it is all up to what interests you about reading it in the first place obviously it is a favorite among neonazis antiSemites and eugenicists but it also has merits among political theorists psychoanalysts and  historians hope that helps. ,books,cpdggkf,13,t5_2qh4i
3380743,0,t3_2yvqif,My days are pretty full  special needs kids who need a lot of handson care and a husband and friends.  But reading is what I do when Im not immediately occupied with something else. I cant do audiobooks I listen to podcasts during daily life but theyre mostly background noise.  I tune out a bit when Im listening to audiobooks and I usually feel like Im missing most of the book. Movies dont interest me that much if I have a free hour then d generally prefer to read.  My husband and kids watch movies and TV and I can be beside them and making the right noises while Im reading my book. gt I do take frequent breaks all day long but I dont feel like  minutes here and there really lends itself to getting in the head space to really enjoy a book. minutes here and there is often how I read.  If I only read when I had an hour free and a comfy space to read in I just wouldnt have read much during the past  years. Kidshusbandjobsfriends are a much loved fact of life so I read in the corners.  Ive got a rule that I fall asleep reading every night which usually gives me at least a half hour or so without interruptionFinding time to read may be different than giving yourself permission to have downtime.  If you really cant pick up a book or pay attention to your partner or play a video game for  minutes thats a different issue than finding reading time.  Youre a grownup with a partner and being productive isnt necessarily the be all and end all of life every minute.  Life is busy but you can still choose to have some down time and choose how youre going to spend that time.  If I always waited for the perfect reading experience I would never read.  But because reading is a priority for me I manage. ,books,cpdmokc,1,t5_2qh4i

3409761,0,t3_2z9fgc,The question here is really are you entitled to unlimited access to content once you have paid for it in one format?The answer to that question is actually... no.  It may not be what this generation wants to hear but when you buy a creative product you are paying for that product  not the intellectual content therein.  Ebooks are not free because ebooks cost money to produce and publishers operate on very thin profit margins in general.  There is all variety of labor there is licensing and royalties marketing and distribution there are the overhead operating costs that come with any business.You dont get a free paperback or audiobook when you buy a hardcover and you would not expect to.  Ebooks are similarly another book format.  Their immateriality helps keep the pricepoint low but there is still a pricepoint.  I know there is a common idea especially on Reddit that art and information should be free damn the man take what you want.  Obviously this sort of simplistic naivete ignores the importance of every single creative field and their attendant industries. To take something for free that was not meant to be free is theft however acrobatically people may justify it.  Its a simple matter of resisting immediate desire and realizing that its better for you in the long run to support the things that you enjoy so that they can continue to exist.Producers are not blind to the let me have it sentiment though and they have been exploring some ways of including or discounting ebooks with print purchases.  And of course the smaller the production the easier it is to offer such benefits  many small presses include free ebook versions with purchase.  Larger companies with wide distribution face different challenges.  The trick is to keep all of these industries viable  industries which benefit you the audience as well as the creators  amidst a climate of distorted value perception and increasing demand for free constant instant access to every impulse and desire.  But I suppose thats the modern condition and a bigger problem in itself.,books,cpgxrz8,11,t5_2qh4i

3420778,0,t3_2zeequ,Theres no fixed meaning in the book that is given to you when you open the book. You have to read engage with the text and interpret it. Thats how meaning arises. So if only for just chronological reasonsi.e. when reading chapter  you dont know what will happen in the next chapter in the middle of the novel or at the endits not possible to read perfectly the first time around. I recently read a novel where water imagery played a big role. But when did I notice that? Maybe late in the novel when I finally noticed it was a trend. But that means I didnt fully understand the importance of the water scenes earlier in the book so I would at least have to turn back and reread those scenes. And some books dont really have a plot so with Bolao for instance you can get deep into his novels without knowing what they are even about. I recently finished a novel of his and while I didnt reread the whole thing I have to turn back and reread parts of it to come to an understanding of it. And as you and others have mentioned if you wait a few years you the reader will have changed so your new engagement with the text will be a different one.  ,books,cpi6zaa,3,t5_2qh4i

3435076,0,t1_cpjkbeh,Events are rarely so well foreshadowed yet unexpected or the characters so believable or so many players interacting understandably.Ive read recently Malazan various Brandon Sanderson novels others that I cant really remember. None of them are as consistent as GRRM. They might have a large world a strong setting a large cast of characters a compelling story but it will be some and not all. For instance Sanderson has great ideas but his worlds are as deep as the immediate surroundings Elantris has four government entities two of which are barely present. Mistborn has a large world but the interactions between settlements are obscure and the logistics of growing food on an ashcovered world unexplored why isnt everyone starving more than they are? Id consider Stormlight Archive his most successful books because they are beginning to show how actions ripple outwards but even they arent as realised as ASoIaF was even in the first book.Malazan has a huge scale but as a result everything is quite isolated. The story unravels very slowly the characters are poorly differentiated events are obscured for the sake of being obscure so that they are frustrating rather than compelling. This on the back of a fascinating magic system awesome divine hierarchy and interesting races it has a family born of light dark and shadow that have been feuding for millenia after being thrown from a different dimension giant inventor dinosaurs that meddled in genetic engineering living prisons for dangerous beings through which visitors can travel...Without writing like the world is living breathing carrying on while your focus is elsewhere you cant match GRRM. ,books,cpjtojm,1,t5_2qh4i

3442133,0,t1_cpkland,Wells and Verne were millenia behind the game Platos Republic would probably be considered among the earliest incarnations of Scifi although some people go as far back as Gilgamesh. A lot of Utopian novels in the same vein as The Republic were written a few hundred years ago There is Bacons New Atlantis in the th century Moores Utopia and Cavendishs Description of a New World in the th century. Outside of this specific utopian genre the other subgenres of scifi also started around this time with an abundance of Lost World and Hollow Earth novels in the th century see Swifts Gullivers Travels and Casanovas Icosameron respectively. In the early th century you see the start of more common modern genres with early precursors of the apocalypse novel Grainvilles Le Dernier HommeThe Last Man the futuristic novel Merciers LAn The Year  and Loudons The Mummy or a Tale of the TwentySecond Century the alternate history Geoffroys Napoleon et la Conquete MondeNapoleon and the Conquer of the World and the alien encounter Defontenays Star ou Psi de CassiopeeThe Star Cassopeia. Then you get to the early incarnations of modern scifi with authors like Wells Verne Shelley and Poe but they didnt invent the genre they just popularized it based on centuries of history.Likewise stories of space travel can be found littered throughout history from Lucians True History in CE to the Arabian Nights but probably the earliest concrete example of a story of space flight and my personal favorite is Poes The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaal in .

3457127,0,t3_2ztpu1,Ive had the blessing to have several professors dedicate some of their class sessions to teaching how to speed read. The trick is to focus on the tops of the words and skim the tops of the lines through the pages. Note that if you cover the top half of a line you cannot read it whereas if you cover the bottom you can read the top half. That is part of the trick the other is practice. Also note that speed reading is best for reading that which you do not need to focus on and comprehend much such as that which is review material or the literature building up to the main argument etc etc. If Im reading a technical piece and I dont want to spend four hours comprehending plant biology or the main points of keynes economic theory which I already know pretty well then I will speed read that section slowing down to comprehend anything new or noteworthy. However if for example it is your first time reading Plato then speed reading will only make you waste time having to read it again as there are so many fine points and important details. So speed reading is useful but not if youre reading something you need to comprehend thoroughly. Hope that helps let me know if you have any questions.,books,cpmc6pm,3,t5_2qh4i

I think trigger warnings would be great for situations like these or you know youre given the heads up that the book will make you uncomfortable and you can think of options for yourself whether it be to drop the course take a bad grade by bsing your way through the assignment not doing the assignment or if the teacher allows an alternative assignment. I like having the freedom of options. People wanting to shut down Clean Reader are shutting down options for people who want it and I dont think thats right. I also dont think forcing others to adhere to those squeaky clean books is right just to say but leave it out as an option. There may be other elements in the book that people enjoy and simply dont want the swear words or a scene or two if people want to censor the books theyve bought to read for pleasure.

As Hawking has always lived in the U.K. and receives his medical care from the NHS the editorial was widely derided. Hawking himself responded I wouldnt be here today if it were not for the NHS. I have received a large amount of highquality treatment without which I would not have survived.

3596281,0,t3_31gsd8,There are only a few types or pieces of literature worse than Douglas Adams Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It is nearly as bad as Vogon poetry. Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the universe. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the MidGalactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been disappointed by the poems reception and was about to embark on a reading of his book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine  in a desperate attempt to save life itself  leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex in the destruction of the planet Earth.

Hadnt read much of him before my final creative writing class in college besides I think What We Talk About... and Popular Mechanics in high school and both of those times I dont think I had the name attached to the work though of course they both stuck in my head. We read The Bath and I liked it a lot but then we read A Small Good Thing and it turned me into a puddle. It was a real revelation this was writing that really spoke to me and it was the first in a long time. Now I own and have read all of his work sans Furious Seasons which I managed to get through interlibrary loan and its sitting on my shelf as we speak. Its strange. I know its probably the least Carver book but Ive just been saving it. I dont want my relationship with the man to end. But the book is due in two weeks! So I guess Ill have to read it which is exciting but dreadful. Maybe Tess will find something...Very few stories or writers since have managed to make me feel the way his work does.

They now have to decide if they want to move forward continue to live on the edge of poverty as they continue to produce fine art or suck it up and get corporate jobs in marketing or illustration. Oh yeah and every other chapter is a Hungarian fairy tale about a prince who goes to save the sun the moon and the stars from the belly of a gigantic boar to win the heart of a princess.  I know this doesnt make a lot of sense but it totally works.

3616793,0,t3_31scng,Books are generally supposed to be digested far more slowly than movies.  There is a lot of extra information that can be relevant in a book but which you lose out on when dealing with the shorter time constraints of a movie.  Books often take the time to detail what a character is thinking and feeling and you dont get that richness of detail in a movie.In addition the general pacing of books often feels very different to the pacing of a movie.  These are off the top of my head numbers but I would say you can be in full flow within  or less of a book but a movie typically wants to spend the first  or more of its time doing basic establishing shots introducing the characters and so on.Thats not to say that books cant be turned into good movies.  But if a movie wants to be good and stay reasonably true to the books it usually has to be pretty long Lord of the Rings.  If it wants to be good and also fit into a regular length movie it has to cut out substantial portions of the book Blade Runner  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.I often come out of booktomovie adaptations feeling that they either should have been longer or not tried to ape the book so much.  For example I didnt really enjoy the Harry Potter movies as movies.  I loved them as a way of visualising the world that I already knew about.  Seeing the Hogwarts Great Hall and the Dementors was a fantastic experience.  But I always came out of them thinking that they would have been better cinematic works if they had deliberately shot for a looser adaptation of the books.,books,cq4jgrv,2,t5_2qh4i

3636089,0,t1_cq67qty,I liked Faulkner in my s but never really loved him until I went back in my mids ... I think he is one of those writers who gives back more the more life and reading experience that you bring to the table yourself. He isnt just a great Southern writer he is one of the greatest period. Some like Sound amp Fury or Absalom Absalom can be tough sledding sometimes so they are probably not the best to read first. I think Light in August is a pretty good starting point.One of the best bits of action writing in English is the river crossing scene in As I Lay Dying. A lot of really good writers actually have action actually happen offstage or revert to a summary rather than narration when things start bumping into other things but Faulkner actually describes what happens and the characters rig up ropes to cross in a way that it is really easy to visualize the lines of force as things start to happen. If you are a writer yourself passages like that in Faulkner are inspiring and humbling at the same time.,books,cq6qpi6,2,t5_2qh4i

3642667,0,t1_cq7arj5,Disclaimer I think to have a good understanding of Machiavellis intentions with The Prince requires a lot more Italian history and context than I have. That said Machiavellis other works were clearly prorepublic and IIRC he was tortured and exiled as a result of said works. It is widely believed that Machiavelli wrote The Prince to curry favor with the Medici family but I subscribe to the argument if that had been his wish the book would have been written in Latin the language of the educated and nobility. By writing in Italian it was intended for the People as a means of shedding light on despotic rule. Further the Medici family would not have needed an instruction manual as this was information they clearly already knew.Can I verify this historically? Nope. But I like it.

3649221,0,t1_cq85xdz,Youve made it into a semantic argument sure. But unfortunately for you you dont get to define how Tolkien uses concepts. Is it not enough that Tolkien never uses the term spirit soul or fea or eala for what is sequestered in the Ring or expended in other acts of dissemination preferring rather power or might or will? Its only redundant because you are insisting with no real cause that certain terms are equivalent. Provide some evidence.Your body analogy is critically flawed. We do not expend body parts in the manner being discussed. Sauron and other Ainur expend their might when they make bodies or invest their power in objects or others. They have a finite reservoir of this power. Under certain conditions they may recapture some but no one is hacking off bits of their soul.Its more as if you were born with a certain amount of breath and every action you took caused you to breathe it out into the void. Breathe back in quick enough and you can get some of it back. Stand near someone letting loose all theyve got the analogy to Morgoth necessary for a discussion of the Ring because the Ring operates using the stain of Morgoths disseminated power and you can get some of what was originally theirs. But if you keep breathing out eventually youre going to run out of breath. When theres no more breath theres no more meaningful action even though you are still there your body and your mind or soul or spirit or whathaveyou. The breath was never part of your mind. It was never part of your body. It was something you had. It was never you that you were using.If you want to use something closer to your analogy the power is your energy. It is something contained within the self that is not inherently part of the self.And if you argue that Sauron doesnt die you are dead wrong. Death is defined by Tolkien to be the severance of spirit and body. Sauron died four times as evidenced by the Osanwekenta. After the fourth he was too weak to directly influence anything or make another body but that was still a death just as the ones that came before. Just as Gandalfs death was still a death as presented in LotR in Letters and elsewhere. Just as Melkors execution was death and just as his fear of the removal of his body from his spirit is explicitly called a fear of death both from Morgoths Ring. A fixation on denial of the term death for embodied spirits in Tolkiens mythos is a bright red flag for overreaching ones familiarity with the work. It is by no means a poorlydefined concept.,books,cq88l45,4,t5_2qh4i

LOTR succeeded in casting NOT by choosing actors who were not AList stars quite many of them were bit by choosing actors who could truly represent the characters they were playing.  That is simply and utterly the key to casting.  You know it when you see bad casting when a character just feels completely artificial or comes across as a horribly cheesy take on a character from a book that you know wouldnt be ANYTHING like that actor in screen.Its as simple as that I feel.,books,cq8wl99,2,t5_2qh4i

3656638,1,t1_cq8u75g,I think youre right.  Popular genre fiction is really no different than literary fiction whatever that means.  Im good friends with a university professor who teaches an undergrad Harry Potter class every semester and a grad student whos writing his thesis on PKD.  I get the distinction that the craft and quality of R.A. Salvatores prose doesnt keep up with Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Raymond Carver but I see little difference between imagining a troubled dark elf fighting his way through the frozen wastes and imagining a man with hooks for hands coming to your door having coffee and then photographing you on your roof throwing stones into the air.I suspect academia is to blame for this conceit.  It smells of tweed jackets expensive pipe tobacco and that shitty purple wine they serve at every university poetry reading.  Long ago Neal Stephenson wrote a really cool answer in a Slashdot interview about the stark difference between academic writing and popular genre fiction writing... let me see...Ah here it is Its the answer to  The lack of respect...  by MosesJones  Very insightful.

DFW apparently left the unfinished Pale King in his office where his wife would find it which suggested that he was okay with it being released. Similar for Roberto Bolanos  as I understand. Conversely despite being a Nabokov fan I absolutely refuse to read The Original of Laura. Nabokov was telling his wife and son on his deathbed not to release it. Then about  years later his son gets it published. And it gets terrible reviews  thanks to his son breaking a dying wish the last reviews that Nabokov will ever have had will be negative.

At first I was carried through the first  pages by hype because I kept hearing that KKC was the best fantasy of the decade.  Then the Tarbean stuff happened and I thought that was pretty good.  But then Kvothe goes to college and nothing happens.  So I put the book down.  I keep telling myself that I will go back and read the rest of TNOTW and then A Wise Mans Fear but then I keep moving on to books that are so much better.I recently read the first book in The Black Company and I thought that was pretty phenomenal.  Ive started to read Joe Abercrombies The Blade Itself and while its too early to pass judgement its shaping up to be a good gritty fantasy.I keep trying to read The Dresden Files and The Kingkiller Chronicles but then I remember that I have read fanfiction that was better written than either of those series so I dont.

3729502,0,t3_333pm3,I stumbled upon it earlier this year at my local bookstore after being frustrated by my search for it at Amazon and BampN. Lesson learned. If you read the Little House books and remember them well enough to be familiar with the characters and events then I think the book will hold up to your expectations. If you do NOT have strong ties to the series I could see Pioneer Girl being a tedious read. Maybe not the manuscript itself but the extensive annotations which go into detail about minor characters and locations the Ingalls familys life and the way the original manuscript ties to the eventual series of novels. I thought it was cool to see Wilders growth from a writer of short newspaper pieces the notes do a good job of showing how some of the early parts of the Pioneer Girl manuscript would work as a newspaper column into a more sophisticated novelist. There are lots of excerpts from Rose Wilder Lanes journal and comments on her relationship to Laura and to the manuscript which A. make a compelling story in its own right and B. put to rest the notion that she and not Laura actually wrote the Little House books. ,books,cqhdyok,2,t5_2qh4i

But this is bad even very bad in some occasions when it comes to personal biases or lack of understanding for a certain book.Go on goodreads.com and look at the reviews of Mein Kampf for example a disappointing portion of the reviews for the book are negative  not because the book itself is bad but because people hated Hitler. link to Mein Kampf on Goodreads here Overall however identify your personal tastes and look for books that satisfy you personally The Great Gatsby may be considered an American classic but not everyone likes it  heck when the book was published it was bombarded with negative book reviews.,books,cqiin9z,2,t5_2qh4i

3895478,0,t3_34zwa1,I actually hadnt heard that this film is a thing! Im intrigued to say the least. As far as the book goes while this story is really on some levels just about how this turmoil within the daughters mind and all of her pent up rage wreaked havoc upon both the Swede and his wife and their entire immediate community it is also about America on a systemic level. In  years the country went from a peaceful paradise full of prosperity baseball games and joy following the end of WW to a society polarized by an unpopular war race riots and other fledgling movements. How did we get from the late s to the chaos of the late s? How could a girl raised in a stable home become so chaotic and destructive?All of these questions and the time period are certainly interesting to me but I felt like the style of this book just didnt grab me and fully engage me with the characters. The story is told in a multi layered frame story with a writer interviewing the brother of the Swede at a high school reunion many years later. This caused the narration to feel disconnected with the Swede and his family. Just when I was getting into the story the perspective would jump around in time again and I would again get disconnected. Also I just felt like it was too long at points. Too verbose. However I definitely see why it won the Pulitzer Prize. I ended up going on to read his entire America trilogy and liked The Human Stain the best. ,books,cr0bhb1,2,t5_2qh4i

I like this method a lot more with classics and literary novels where what youre reading is backstory or scenery description or some kind of subtle dialogue exchange full of extra layers of meaning etc etc a lot of the time rather than more commercial novels where I might have to put down the book in the middle of a dramatic action scene. With older or more literary books sometimes reading in more bitesized chunks and letting them percolate can help me get more out of what Im reading. It might be something you need to practice and train yourself to do  mentally hold on to your place when you put a book down so its easier to pick it up again and dive right in without having to backread a few paragraphs to get reimmersed.Right now for example Im reading Daphne du Mauriers My Cousin Rachel.

A basic plot with fairly twodimensional characters the main characters father in particular felt like a missed opportunity.  In particular one of the things I didnt like was the hints of scifi.  I like scifi as a genre but Gaiman peppered the more mystical characters Im struggling with the names  the ones that had the ocean in their yard with suggestions that their abilities were sciencebased rather than magic but it just felt like he was trying to hint at story depth that didnt actually exist.  It was a fine story but somehow I doubt anyone wouldve cared about it if it hadnt had the name Gaiman in block letters on the cover.  It might also be that I was expecting something that the book wasnt  Id heard it was Gaimans first adult novel since Anansi Boys but reading it it felt like a YA novel which is fine if thats what youre expecting.  ,books,cr5h6wj,1,t5_2qh4i

Like almost all our graveyards it has a melancholy look the ditches surrounding it have long been overgrown grey wooden crosses have fallen askew and rotted under their once painted gables the gravestones are all out of position just as if someone had pushed them from below two or three bare trees hardly provide some meager shade the sheep wander unchecked among the tombs . . . But among them is one grave untouched by human beings and not trampled on by any animal only the birds perch on it and sing at daybreak. An iron railing surrounds it and two young fir trees have been planted there one at each end Evgeny Bazarov is buried in this tomb. Often from the nearby village two frail old people come to visit ita husband and wife. Supporting one another they walk with heavy steps they go up to the iron railing fall on their knees and weep long and bitterly and gaze intently at the silent stone under which their son lies buried they exchange a few words wipe away the dust from the stone or tidy up some branches of a fir tree then start to pray again and cannot tear themselves away from that place where they seem to be nearer to their son to their memories of him . . . Can it be that their prayers and their tears are fruitless? Can it be that love sacred devoted love is not all powerful? Oh no! However passionate sinful or rebellious the heart hidden in the tomb the flowers growing over it peep at us serenely with their innocent eyes they tell us not only of eternal peace of that great peace of indifferent nature they tell us also of eternal reconciliation and of life without end.Fathers and Sons Turgenev,books,cr8vn44,1,t5_2qh4i

Theres a chapter told from the perspective of one character who is wildly successful but has always felt like he was the sidekick to his more talented more philosophical more charismatic friend. And hes perfectly happy to be in that position. He loves the guy thinks the world of him.  The friend comes to visit and little by little the illusion is broken. The last straw is the copy of Ulysses his friend had always kept on him. When they were kids he thought this was evidence of his friends worldliness and cultured interests. Now that theyre middleaged he realizes that the copy of Ulysses actually held a flask.  It wasnt always like that was it?  Its so universaleveryones had someone in their lives that theyve placed on a pedestal just to be disappointed by themand beyond heartbreaking. But theres also a great lesson. Judging your own life and worth by what you think of other people is a tremendous mistake. You may fail to appreciate the wonder and beauty of your own life for no other reason than thinking far too highly of someone else.,books,crampcz,3,t5_2qh4i

Attending church and baptism and all else is mere obedience to Him because we are grateful for the sacrifice He made to demonstrate His love. Im not trying to recruit you to a church or denomination. Only think of what Jesus has done for me and you. The fact is we all sin since we break the ten commandments such as lying and taking His name in vain. The Bible says if we break the law at ANY point we are guilty against the whole law much like a chain. It only takes one link to break to ruin the connection. But fortunately for us God sent His only Son to pay for our sins once and for all and ALL He asks for is us in return. Not to do this or do that. I hope you understand His goodness. He loves you.

Her world building is intriguing and its fascinating to watch her characters navigate the difficulties of their worlds and come out stronger on the other side.  The only downside is that she does have a knack for writing somewhat whiny protagonists on occasion.  I was mildly irritated by Fitz the primary protagonist in the Farseer trilogy in the first couple of books but he improves as the story progresses.  But the Soldiers Son trilogy is what did me in.  Its not related to her other trilogies and its such a unique setting for a fantasy story I actually really loved the setting.  But she wrote that trilogys protagonist in a horribly unsympathetic way  Navarre makes Fitz look stoic and takecharge by comparison.  He also faces ridiculous prejudice from the other characters that just turned my stomach.

One of the most important things to do when you first start working out is to find a form of exercise you enjoy. Do that for a while and get in the habit then shift to more serious stuff.Reading is the same way. Its much easier to retain and comprehend information when you enjoy thinking about it. If you enjoy doing it with some books after a while youll get in the habit of thinking about and paying attention to what you read to the point where youll be able to do it even when the material isnt particularly engaging. So you are probably going to be better off reading fiction story books since theyre usually more fun than instructional stuff.YA stuff might be a good place to start since its mostly fun and engaging but not so deep youll be overwhelmed. The Harry Potter series is fairly standard as is Redwall. Or you can look at Enders Game by Orson Scott Card please buy used or get from a library. If you want something with a little more fun and sex look up almost anything by Christopher Moore Coyote Blue would be my recommended starting point.Basically go to your school library head to the fiction section. Start looking at the backsdustcovers of books see if any of the descriptions make you say huh... cool. Pick out  books that do and start reading.

There are different specifics but there are still a lot of things causing circumstances to be dire for a vast number of workers where they are in a plight as it concerns providing for the family. A large number of people with fulltime jobs are struggling to make ends meet and some cannot without government assistance. Costs for the essentials are rising faster than wages. Unions are embattled. The middle class is shrinking. Income inequality is getting more pronounced. There are attempts to erode government protections and social safety nets. Jobs are moving overseas. Automation is already occurring and is just going to get worse. And like in Grapes of Wrath there are those who are doing all right who have little sympathy for those who are struggling and really have nowhere to go in order to better their situations the equivalent of looking down on the Okies. One of the central themes of The Grapes of Wrath was the failure of society to care for its most vulnerable and that issue is very relevant today.,books,crqihsk,3,t5_2qh4i

So thats step one.Step two is to keep them around and not nearly conveniently stored on a bookshelf either. That keeps them out of sight and out of mind. Pile them all up somewhere I use my kitchen table. Just a big old pile of books staring me in the face whenever I come home. Then when you buy more books in step one you dont put those away ether you just add it to the pile. Eventually it will grow so perilous youll start reading frantically just to avoid the mess. Worst case scenario this doesnt work for you and you eventually shelve them. Oh well you still have more books! How great is that? Theyre books!

4167346,0,t1_crv8b0l,I disagree.  While fans clearly dont have any right in the legal sense to expect GRRM to ever write another book theres a tacit understanding that when an author starts a multibook series hell finish it in a somewhat timely manner.  When the author instead does a variety of other things  which he has been enabled to do by the money given to him by fans who bought his books on the implicit understanding that the author would finish the story in a sensible amount of time  the fans have a right to be irritated.  Id put it this way.  If this series had been a quiet moderate success GRRM would have finished it a while ago.  He would have had to in order to make ends meet.  In that sense GRRM does owe his fans something His ability to live his life e.g. spend WAY more time doing whatever he wants than your average working adult has the ability to do.I might feel more positively about his actions if I hadnt started reading the series in .,books,crvaaah,8,t5_2qh4i

I didnt have a question for you then but naturally thought of one one the drive home...I loved Slow Regard of Silent Things and one of the things I noticed was how much it reminded me of a traditional pointandclick adventure like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango. Auri visits and revisits various named locations collects items uses and combines items in her inventory etc.Is this just me overinterpreting things or were you maybe unconsciously or not influenced by adventure games in your writing? I know its unlikely but considering that indie adventure games had a big resurgence in the last few years I could see an adaptation of Slow Regard in the vein of games like Machinarium working very well.,books,crwwm12,1,t5_2qh4i
4181620,0,t3_38pdo9,Hello Mr. Rothfuss! I am a HUGE fan of your work! I find it interesting that there has been no mention of your short story The Lightning Tree contained in the book Rogues. It was my initial introduction to your work and the reason I sought out more and then found the KKC series you are so famous for. I absolutely LOVE Bast and am looking forward to more about him! For everyone out there who like me are on the edge of their seats for Patricks upcoming installment of The King Killer Chronicles AND you were unaware of this WONDERFUL short story by Patrick Rothfuss It is the second to the last story in the Anthology called Rogues. The story title is The Lightning Tree.My question dear sir is thus HaveWould you consider writing other short stories similar to the aforementioned one? The Slow Regard of Silent Things seems a lot like that and I loved that window into Auris life  just as The Lightning Tree was like a window into Bast as a character. If you have considered it what was your decision regarding it? It could be a great way to keep your fans appeased haha!EDIT As you have pretty much answered my question via another persons question since I posted mine maybe I can revise a bit and ask something else In The Lightning Tree  Is the answer to the riddle What has never been seen before and will never be seen again?  Today? Thats my guess! and also Did you write this novella specifically for the book Rogues or was it a creation you already had? Thank you so much for your stories your talent is an inspiration!,books,crwwpe8,1,t5_2qh4i
4181646,0,t3_38pdo9,Hi Pat! Huge fan here really just wanted to say how much I enjoy your books and following all of your work and shenanigans on the web. Ive been recommending The Kingkiller Chronicles like a madman and I think my friends are going quite insane. The characters in your books are really vivid in the sense that they feel like actual people doing the whole magical otherworldly thing. To me thats what makes the whole fantasy genre so appealing and your books are no exception. So I started wondering are they real? Not in any weird sense hear me out Do you write yourself or people you know into your books i.e. give certain character traits to the people in your universe that you have yourself? ,books,crwwt78,1,t5_2qh4i

I had my dad read both of the kingkiller books and for the past two years literally every time I talk to him he asks me when your next book is coming out. I have to explain to him that I have no idea and you have no idea and itll be out when its done. But generally he is sassy and impatient and I guess because of Robert Jordan thinks it is never going to get finished he wants to know badly. Its our favorite series and one of the few things we bond over. So let me ask and get the dumb question out of the way. When is Doors of Stone coming out?Thank you I love your work and I am so sorry. ,books,crx6wbn,1,t5_2qh4i

4186526,0,t1_crx4cwh,Dont get me wrong I really wanted to like Name of the Wind.Unfortunately the structure of the Kingkiller Chronicles absolutely lost me. I was totally hooked by Kvothe in the present  a former hero running from glory with his sassy demon friend hes got a bar in the middle of nowhere in some noname town and a great evil is gathering over the mountains. Awesome! Lets go!Oh wait the actual story is about this guy as a kid? Well I couldnt care less about him as a kid can we get back to him as a fully developed interesting character? Nope eight hundred pages of school drama. Boring not made more interesting by the inclusion of magic just people being petty and annoying Ive got enough of that in my own life.Slow Regard on the other hand introduces me to this strange and wonderful character and then develops her in a really beautiful immediate way. Like the beginning of Name of the Wind the stakes in her world are clearly and brilliantly established  and unlike Name of the Wind they arent immediately subverted.But thats just like my opinion man.,books,crxgrs0,3,t5_2qh4i

Id read a lot of science fiction and I used to enjoy the ways that writers could take you to new places. What appealed to me in Borgess collection of stories was their dreamlike quality it didnt seem to matter that he was describing impossible things. The Library of Babel is a case in point. Such a library with all possible books containing every possible combination of letters is clearly not a realistic proposition as soon as you even start to do the maths you realise it would be bigger than the whole galaxy. And if it contained the story of your life as it would it would contain every single variation of your life for every path you took since your birth you would also be able to read the version where you took a different step. There would also be versions in which you turn into a giant insect or invade a planet or become a Samourai warrior. These are not in the story. I thought of them as I was reading.

I frequent both rbooksuggestions and rsuggestmeabook all the time myself.This will most likely be taken down but to answer your question I would recommend the Foundation trilogy or Enders Game assuming you enjoy scifi. Foundation might be a bit more than youre willing to take in but they are considered the or one of the best pieces of science fiction literature in the world. Enders Game might be more up your ally if youre not already an avid reader though. It was written to appeal to young people but it is by no means a young adult novel. It is one of my favorites and the sequels are even better imo. Synopsis Set in the future humanity has just fought and barely survived two wars with the buggers an insectoid race with a hive mind. They are not hopeful that they will survive a third invasion. For this reason the best and brightest kids from around the world are taken from their homes to space station for command school to create tactical and strategic geniuses to lead the armies of Earth against the impending invasion.

I liked a lot of the scifi stuff Stephenson did. I liked the skateboard that had adjustable spokes so it could ride smoothly over rough terrain I liked the glass knives cut down to a molecule thick I liked the idea of virtual drug but I found Stephenson to be an absolutely subpar writer. At no point in the story did I feel anything for any of the characters the plot was slow moving but I personally didnt feel like it built up to anything I didnt finish the novel so I dont know if any of the Sumerian stuff makes sense at the end but to be honest the thing that fucking killed me is that Stephenson just tries to get too cute. The mob boss that flies out in a helicopter if the pizza is delivered late? The names of all the characters...Yours Truly? Hiro Protagonist? Terrible things like that completely took me out of the book. Those are the things I really remember but I remember rolling my eyes and shaking my head several times throughout the book when I was reading it.

I was not directly linking victims of those sort of things and holocaust deniers. Absolutely not. gtThats not life thats trauma. Often suffering is life. It may not be a popular opinion but its true. This is one gun I am sticking to. I once watched a documentary on a country in Africa where a commercial building was installed and ended up overfishing the lake. Part of the documentary talked of homeless children who picked at the garbage day in and day out to find food but not just food glue. Theyd use that glue or a similar substance to get high. The most horrific part was that the presenter said that they do this not only to get to sleep despite all the hunger pains but so they wouldnt wake up if anybody attacked them. It only took you a few seconds to realize that they meant if someone decided to rape them or beat them to death.I know that its not all horror and I know there is much good in the world but I still feel that these lyrics can ring true for manyHow can hell be any worse when life alones a fucking curse? ,books,csa1av9,1,t5_2qh4i

4315126,0,t1_csbz8nb,Fifty Shades is a retelling of Twilight originally called Master of the Universe. Even with the rewrite it went through before being published  shades has HUGE chunks of Twilight in it still. There was a blog awhile back by someone who had a masters in lit doing a chapter by chapter breakdown about how each major eventscene in the book was lifted directly from Twilight. It is fanfiction. Its fiction existing on someone elses work. Which she then took and published and made money from which is what plagerize means. You cant just take someones book make a few tweaks change the characters names and publish it. Its amazing Meyers just let it go. As far as I knew last year James was still having Fanfiction removed. Maybe someone smacked some sense into her about it maybe shes just too busy to care these days.Edit let me clarify that I dont have a problem with fanfiction. I do have a problem with somebody doing a slight rewrite on anothers work and then publishing it. The fact that shes making money off of it is where I draw the line.

4358700,0,t3_3axws2,I cant say its something Ive ever noticed but then again I probably would not hang around in any subreddit that had such a bias. General antiintellectualism is something Ive noticed from time to time but nothing like to the extent that some reddittors seem to think again theres likely some element of selection bias though.In my offline life antibookism and antiintellectualism is something I encountered much more as a teenager than as an adult. I might have heard it from fellow students when I was at school but never from my predominantly middleaged colleagues even those who havent picked up a book in years. Perhaps therefore the still relatively young reddit demographic has something to do with it.The people who engage in this kind of antiintellectualism also seem to be those who are not necessarily unintelligent but for whatever reason have failed to achieve what they aee as their potential. Perhaps this is why it seems especially prevalent among those who were brought up in an age when this is the end of boom and bust sounded convincing but ultimately entered the adult world at a time of deep recession. They were told all their lives that they were smart and could do anything they wanted and that didnt happen.All of which is a only my own theorising and possibly has no basis in fact and b a bit of a moot point when the advice is to ignore them.

4382953,0,t3_3b6gh9,I do this sometimes. In my case I generally find the cause is either A. I got distracted from reading for one reason or another a move a health crisis general life stress even a vacation or just one of those busy weeks where you dont have much time to read or B. Im as seeming so many readers are a moody reader where I alternate between either big reading binges where I spend almost all my free time reading and cant get enough or spells where I cant seem to get into anything. On occasion this shift will happen even when Im in the middle of a good book so even though I was enjoying it I just cant seem to pick it back up. I would say for me it doesnt happen super often. From tracking my reading on GoodReads it seems I end up setting down and not returning to around  books a year out of the roughly  a year I read. Part of the trick would be to be sure you pick them back up as soon as you can. I know the longer a half finished book languishes on my shelf the less likely I am to pick it back up. Sometimes it literally just takes shutting up or overriding the part of your mind that says meh I dont want to finish that and just pick it up. I have finished some finally that way. Generally if you were enjoying it if you can just pick it back up again especially if its either a book whose plot stuck with you or something you only put down within the last month or so often you can get right back into it. This is what Ive noticed with myself. Usually once I get myself through to the end on one book Im okay for months and I continue to finish but inevitably something happens in my life every so often and this happens again. Cant do much about life events getting in the way but if youre habitually not finishing youve got to see what you can change.

Would it help to read one at a time instead?,books,csjp13h,1,t5_2qh4i

4390562,0,t3_3b9c66,Probably different take here.  I found the books a solid pretty good.  Far from the worst Ive ever read but none as good as Enders Game. I think the main reason is because Card seems to like to set up several different plot lines in the beginning of a book and then goes down basically one of them.  I noticed that the one he picks was routinely NOT the one I wanted to read about.  Given enough books I suppose all the stories would get closed up.  But after reading them all I was left Extremely dissatisfied.  I would not recommend reading them.  They are not bad books.  They are just frustrating.  You spend hundreds of pages reading about stuff that bluntly isnt always very interesting and thus far at least hes never gotten around to telling the more interesting stories.Its much like a lot of TV shows  Caprica comes immediately to mind.  It had the potential to be AWESOME but they spent all  shows setting up for the AWESOME second season they never got  because the first season was nothing but build up and back story.

You proceed to look them all up then run them over in your head a few times to remember. Ten pages later you come across tenebrous and you try to remember what it means but you fail and look it up again. Ten pages later you come across terpsichorean and you remember it. So you run it over in your head and continue reading. Ten pages later you get pother and you dont remember so you look it up again. Ten pages after that you come across five new words you have no idea what they are and you look them up in the dictionary and start the process again now with ten words instead of five. Sometimes you have to look them up again sometimes you remember what a word means. This process repeats until you are juggling  words in your head that you just learned some of them hard to remember some of them easy. You start thinking about them as you are drifting off to sleep remembering this definition then the next then the next and the next. You forget some but it doesnt matter. You remember others and feel a sense of pleasure from your expanding memory. By the end of the book you can give a definition of each in your own words you can use them in a sentence or you may just have a vague understanding of them. Maybe only  of the  stuck with you and when you come across them again you wont remember them. But if you keep at it the connections will start forming and you will find things easier to remember.This is all my own experience mixed with some things I read off the internet dealing with memory expansion. Hopefully it helps.,books,cslc0qr,2,t5_2qh4i

The character criticism is sort of true for most of her work but her earlier works arent hitting you every few moments with ideology though thematically they are dealing with mostly the same things. gt Some of the most rigid turgid prose.Possibly. You could very well be right seeing as how the last time I read any of her work was five years ago and that was Anthem which is by far her best or second best work. Though at a certain point writing quality becomes a subjective preference rather than objective judgment.

Bit of a tangent here but I also spent three years in some online roleplaying communities and people would frequently be way overly descriptive about everything they did. The main purpose of this was to help prevent confusion among other people in the scene but it was also frequently done because Thats what good writers do.On the contrary you discovered exactly what I did Keep your descriptions simple and only focus on the stuff your audience should take an interest in and everything seems to go much more smoothly.

Not too far off from the age of Harry in book  so I could relate to him.As I and Harry aged a lot of themes about growing up were worked into the stories. I could still relate because I was going through a lot of the same stuff.If I lived under a rock and had just started reading the series now a book about a preteen going to school to learn magic wouldnt have the same appeal. The later ones with more adult themes might still appeal but Id have to stick the time into reading the first  to get to number  where I think it starts to turn adult and probably wouldnt do it.Just another thought it annoys me that the next book always seems to take on new ideas and issues that for some reason are never thought of to be relevant by the recurring characters during the first book.

4473712,0,t3_3cbfcp,The collected works of H.H.Munro aka Saki.  You can search your whole life and never find a drier wit or a more clever twister of plots.  Best of all the stories are in the public domain so you can get them from Gutenburg.  For the uninitiated I would recommend going with the Beasts and Superbeasts collection.  Then when youve become familiar with his style go for the Chronicles of Clovis collection and stories featuring Reginald.  I admit to liking the fan favorites Sredni Vashtar The Storyteller Tobermory etc. but really almost any of his stories is worth the  minutes spent on it.  And theyre great for getting insight albeit satirical on that period in history as well.,books,csul0f3,2,t5_2qh4i

4475000,0,t3_3cdtoh,Its a fake teaser but incredibly wellmade. I hope they get Crispin Glover to play Count Olaf. I think hed be amazingly creepy and vile. Below is every reference I spotted in the teaser. The same post but with added pictures is over here. Let me know if I missed any. I dont see anything referencing The Hostile Hospital The Slippery Slope or The End.SPOILERS. The Gothic Archies  Wrote songs for every A Series of Unfortunate Events audiobook. Daniel Handler plays accordion.. Birdcage  Sunny is imprisoned here in The Bad Beginning the first book.. Eyes  Ever present throughout the books always a reminder of the villainous Count Olaf who hunts the Baudelaires unceasingly. He has a tattoo of an eye on his ankle.. Jars of snake skin  A reference to The Repile Room the second book wherein the Baudelaires are sent to live with Montgomery Montgomery who has a reptile collection which includes the Incredibly Deadly Viper.. Violets ribbon  Violet always ties up her hair in a ribbon when shes thinking her way out of a problem.. Nuptial Law book tickets to the Marvellous Marriage a marriage licence  All part of Count Olafs plan in the Bad Beginning to steal the Baudelaire fortune by tricking Violet to marry him under the guise of a play. I believe the book is how the Baudelaires figure it out.. The Daily Punctilio  All the news in fits of print. Throughout the books this is the terrible newspaper of record in the Baudelaires world.. Baudelaire Tragic Fire headline  The origin story for the Baudelaire orphans. While theyre at the beach their house burns down with their parents inside.. Hotel Denouement cap front desk bell room key  The hotel where the Baudelaires are based for the twelfth book in the series The Penultimate Peril. The Room  on the room key seems to be a reference to The Shining. Jar of fungus Mushroom Minutiae book  The Medusoid Mycelium is a deadly mushroom that grows in the Gorgonian Grotto. A single spore has such grim power that you may die within the hour. From the eleventh book The Grim Grotto.. Photograph of three people  Maybe the Quagmire triplets? Introduced in The Austere Academy the fifth book.. Long cigarette holder  Belongs to Esme Squalor villainous girlfriend to Count Olaf introduced in the sixth book The Ersatz Elevator.. Lucky Smells Lumbermill Paltryville Constitution book Advanced Ocular Science book blonde wig earrings pearl necklace  References to the fourth book The Miserable Mill where the Baudelaires work at Lucky Smells Lumbermill in Paltryville and Klaus visits the local eye doctor where Count Olaf is disguised as a female receptionist named Shirley.. Crow  Reference to the murder of crows that lives in the Village of Fowl Devotees where the Baudelaires go to live in the seventh book The Vile Village.. Glasses  Klaus wears them.. Books  Ever present. A Series of Unfortunate Events is chockfull of literary references and books are frequently integral to solving mysteries or finding solutions to problems. Klaus is the primary reader of the Baudelaire siblings with an eidetic memory.. The V.F.D. eye  a shadowy organization to which Count Olaf may or may not belong has an eye as its symbol. The letters V F and D make up the eye. Members of this organization all have a tattoo of this eye.. How To Start Fires book  This is Count Olafs favourite thing. He probably wrote the book.. Main Street  This novel  Not sure what the connection is.. Statue  The statue behind the books is of dancer Isadora Duncan namesake of two of the Quagmire triplets who are introduced in the fifth book.. Dishes maggots  Count Olaf is filthy and vile. This is the state of his home. On the plates are the leftovers of spaghetti alla puttanesca which the Baudelaires make for him and his theatre troupe in the first book.. Lake Lachrymose map mapping instruments jarred Lachrymose Leech  References to the third book The Wide Window. The Baudelaires live near this lake and are advised to wait one hour before going out onto the lake after eating because the leeches will devour anyone who has the smell of food on them. Their guardian in this book Josephine Anwhistle lost her husband to the leeches. She likely loses her own life to them as well when Count Olaf throws her in.. Count Olafs hand and silhouette  Hes vile and villainous and creepy and greedy and stupid.. Tarot cards  A reference to Olivia Caliban the fortune teller at and owner of Caligari Carnival where the Baudelaires pretend to be freaks in The Carnivorous Carnival the ninth book.Did I miss any?,books,csuqtp7,18,t5_2qh4i

I think people like Rorschach because he never waivers he never quits which is a level of conviction that I think most people wish they possessed. Rorschach is the the mind unencumbered by the superego. He does what he wants and says what he wants under the belief that he is right. Its a level of freedom many of us irrationally wished we possessed even though we dont because such freedom is actually damaging.

4586994,0,t1_ct8ospc,But this is a false premise if you have the wherewithal to make charitable contributions of any sort you are benefitting from its act. A person financially mentally emotionally physically socially capable of performing a charitable act has in no uncertain terms benefitted from the act in any or all the the ways that allowed them to perform the act.In fact using your own definition I could argue that the only true acts of charity would be the ones that sacrifice ones life for that of another with no other benefit. So public servants in the line of duty are incapable since they receive an income people are also incapable of charitably saving a friend or a family member since in saving their progenitors they in fact save a piece of themselvesa kind of social legacy any one who has saved another and the other knows they were saved is incapable of a charitable act since the knowledge of their charity benefits their memoryeven if the identity of the savior is unknown and any one who is discovered to have saved another at the expense of their life is excluded for the same reason. So by your definition charity is an act committed for a stranger who is unaware of their own mortal harm that sacrifices the doers life and is never discovered by anyone. And thus without evidence that such a thing is even possible because evidence would nullify its very existance renders the entire idea of charity ridiculous and impossible.,books,ct8sf2e,0,t5_2qh4i

But theyre enjoyable movies and youll probably like them.Id say the first two are the worst and then they get a lot better. I think Prisoner of Azkaban was probably the best.

All of these books give a different frame work for approaching an ideological problem. Id even argue every great author gives you a different frame of reference to objectively approach framing your thought processes on a whole litany of issues whether political or personal. You cant honestly approach any issue objectively until you can understand the different ways to approach it from a subjective sense. Basically what Im saying is definitely read things you agree with but read things you disagree with more vigorously. Reading after all is the free exchange of ideas in a very intimate medium. The intimacy of it helps me at least to understand different approaches to problem solving idea debate and conflict resolution on a much deeper level than just listening to politicians spouting party points or friends arguing why their ideas are more valid than mine. Also this is just a difference of opinion or interpretation in a small portion of the enormous spectrum of ideology.

As a master of the mystic arts he deals primarily with spells and meditation serving as a guide and guru to a lot of other heroes in the MCU.Kamala Khan the new Ms. Marvel is another great example. A young Muslim girl who came into power that she never bargained for. Not a fan of violence but of helping others. She saved a drunk girl from drowning for example. When she has had to use her powers in combat it seems a bit begrudgingly. She doesnt want to harm others if she can avoid it.Both are getting movie adaptations. I cant speak ofr those portrayals they arent out yet.But you know what? You are trying to shoehorn any and all violence into a masculine category to prove your point. I dont think that its accurate or fair to say that any violence  masculinity. What about a character who only defends others through force but never attacks? Or a character like Kamala who dislikes needing to injure? Youre painting a black and white world. And its obvious why you view comicscomic movies as black and white. You think that theres no merit to be found in the superhero genre that all it is is stereotypes of bad guys getting pommeled by good to fulfill some power fantasy. But its more than that. On top of that trying to paint any violence as proof of a depiction of masculinity? Please. The world is grey.,books,ct9qjfh,2,t5_2qh4i

4611558,0,t1_ctbsypd,Hang on though  there was a very very clear reason for why Katniss had never wanted children and it was because of her adamant refusal to subject anyone innocent to having to grow up in a world where they had to fear the reaping and wonder whether they would have to die in the Hunger Games. And I think that Katniss should be given some credit here because shes nobodys puppet and any decision she makes has always been and will always be her own. If youll remember the scene that Peeta and Gale spend discussing who shell choose in that moment its extremely easy for her to make a decision  she doesnt need either of them if theyre going to be that thick about this. And sure maybe its a small case of give it ten years but youre very wrong in that Katniss isnt a motherly type  look at the way she interacts with Prim and Rue because speaking as a sister thats not how you act towards a sibling. Thats how you act towards a sibling that you had to take responsibility for and practically be a mother towards. Also  youre discounting the possibility of a changing of heart because while not everyone will change their mind about definitely not wanting kids it is very difficult to accurately predict the circumstances youll be in ten twenty years from now. Things change. Attitudes evolve and some who wanted kids decide they dont anymore some that didnt want kids decide they do. Theres a reason so many insist that young adults will change their mind about wanting children  and thats because a lot of people do change their minds. Im personally going to disagree though regarding the white picket fence because after so many years of turmoil Katniss needed exactly that  something typical something peaceful. And that need resonated in her ultimately ending up with Peeta because he could counteract her bitter cynicism in a way that would hopefully help her be happier. The thing about constant hot and heavy negativity is that it sure as hell burns brightly but once it burns out theres nothing left. And Katniss didnt want to lose herself to her ordeals shed already nearly done that once and it hadnt been a fun experience. Being around young children would have reminded her painfully of Prim and Rue and all the children killed in the Games but I think it also would have been a way to honor them. Those children were going to grow up in a world without that terror and it was the ultimate revenge against Snow who had been so dedicated in the end to wiping out ever small happiness Katniss had left.Finally I dont remember enough about the end of the books to be completely sure but I am  positive that Katniss would have had absolutely nothing to do with any kind of public position after the events of Mockingjay. Im also  positive that while living in total seclusion may be unlikely I wouldnt be surprised at all if it was somewhere that was somewhat out of the way she went through horrible ordeals and needed time to heal and I dont think she could have done that anywhere near other people. And while okay maybe there would have been some risks this is after the major powers had been eradicated and Im very convinced that there would have been no possibility of harm coming to her kids from some evil entity. Again  Katniss is extremely protective of children and I think largely its because she was never allowed to have a proper childhood. In District  no one could. And until that changed until she was sure no kids would ever go through hardship like that again her decision on never having kids would stay the same. ,books,ctbva9z,3,t5_2qh4i

Write the best book and give it the best sendoff you can. Most writers I know cant help but write. Thats our thing. If youre in this business only for the money than youre doing it all wrong.Heres the thing about working a day job and writing. You work that day job until you cant anymore. You work that day job until youre just so busy something has to give. Ive been more fortunate than most but I also work much harder now for less money than I ever did being a cubicle monkey.

4620591,0,t1_ctczirm,Yes and no.There are very few similarities between the two beyond the name. There is only one character in the movie that appears in the book though Gerry is very very loosely based on the interviewer in the book in the sense that they both travel the world and they both work for the UN. Those are actually the only similarities.The book is phenomenal. The audiobook is actually even better. Max Brooks World War Z is written as an oral history of a past zombie war. Its written in a future after humanity has fought back a zombie apocalypse. The book is written in interview format and features characters spread all across the world. It alternates between people who had huge impacts on the war and just the regular folks. Its also written as if Max Brooks is the actual UN investigator who went around doing the interviews. Even the foreward in that book pretends as if the whole thing was written postapocalypse. Its incredibly well put together.That said I actually do really like the movie World War Z as well. I think that it stands on its own as a really great zombie movie. I just wish they hadnt used the title World War Z. A proper adaptation in documentary or Band of Brothers formatting will now probably never happen.But I can dream.,books,ctd02po,13,t5_2qh4i

Rick Atkinsons recent WW trilogy is also very good but his focus is narrower  only the U.S. Army. The books about North Africa and Italy are better imho than the third one about Normandy. John Keegans The Face of Battle gives both the generals and the grunts perspectives of three famous battles Agincourt Waterloo and the Somme iirc. Its considered a classic for good reason.

He is literally attacking vain shallow immoral decadence and hedonism.     gt What I mean is these toxic elements of narcissism consumerism yuppies etc. elicit such qualities of shallowness filth and soullessness  Obviously...   gt I know Ellis said these stories are based off of his life and he could be describing what was occurring during this time   He was from his own personal experience. He had a lot of money and lived in NYC during the s.    Im not sure what youre wanting here.

It was also wise to grant Aes Sedai any favors they asked and a pigeon was a small favor.A message to each merchant you correspond with. Tarmon Gaidon is coming soon.He shrugged uneasily. That is nothing to do with me Aes Sedai. Im a merchant. She was asking for a good many pigeons. He corresponded with merchants as far away as Shienar. But I will send your message. He would too however many birds it required. Only stoneblind idiots failed to keep promises to Aes Sedai. Besides which he wanted rid of her and her talk of the Last Battle.Do you recognize this? she said fishing a leather cord from the neck of her dress.His breath caught and he stretched out a hand brushed a finger across the heavy gold signet ring on the cord. Across the crane in flight. How had she come by this? Under the Light how? I recognize it he told her his voice suddenly hoarse.My name is Nynaeve ti alMeara Mandragoran. The message I want sent is this. My husband rides from Worlds End toward Tarwins Gap toward Tarmon Gaidon. Will he ride alone?He trembled. He did not know whether he was laughing or crying. Perhaps both. She was his wife? I will send your message my Lady but it has nothing to do with me. I am a merchant. Malkier is dead. Dead I tell you.The heat in her eyes seemed to intensify and she gripped her long thick braid with one hand. Lan told me once that Malkier lives so long as one man wears the hadori in pledge that he will fight the Shadow so long as one woman wears the kisain in pledge that she will send her sons to fight the Shadow. I wear the kisain Master Aldragoran. My husband wears the hadori. So do you. Will Lan Mandragoran ride to the Last Battle alone?He was laughing shaking with it. And yet he could feel tears rolling down his cheeks. It was madness! Complete madness! But he could not help himself. He will not my Lady. I cannot stand surety for anyone else but I swear to you under the Light and by my hope of rebirth and salvation he will not ride alone. For a moment she studied his face then nodded once firmly and turned away. He flung out a hand after her. May I offer you wine my Lady? My wife will want to meet you. Alida was Saldaean but she definitely would want to meet the wife of the Uncrowned King.Thank you Master Aldragoran but I have several more towns to visit today and I must be back in Tear tonight.He blinked at her back as she glided toward the door gathering her cloak. She had several more towns to visit today and she had to be back in Tear tonight! Truly Aes Sedai were capable of marvels!Silence hung in the common room. They had not been keeping their voices low and even the girl with the dulcimer had ceased plying her hammers. Everyone was staring at him. Most of the outlanders had their mouths hanging open.Well Managan Gorenellin he demanded do you still remember who you are? Do you remember your blood? Who rides with me for Tarwins Gap?For a moment he thought neither man would speak but then Gorenellin was on his feet tears glistening his eyes. The Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gaidon he said softly.The Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gaidon!

4750168,0,t3_2zj5rc,One of the best books Ive read in a long time. In a class by itself.  You start reading feeling mildly interested in Ebenezer as a young man and end wishing you could move in with him as an old one. The writing is brilliant and authentic. I just bought a hardback copy online so I could keep it at home for rereading and passing along to the next generation. It occurred to me that its a bit like the Little House on the Prairie books in this way what seems like a simple narrative built of little more than this happened then that happened turns out to be an unforgettable moving story that remains with you forever. ,books,cttay70,1,t5_2qh4i

4751582,0,t1_ctt4t1q,It definitely does exoticize the arab world and it may be at best clumsy in how it handles the female characters. But I actually think as a book Blankets is more objectionable to me Blankets is a very singular view of life from a middle class white straight male western perspective  and it doesnt challenge or really evaluate any of these things  theres nothing particularly offensive about it because imo theres nothing particularly challenging. Habibi on the other hand is trying to tackle much bigger issues about sex religion and gender you actually see Craig Thompson evaluate his own perspective and change it I think its certainly not a perfect book but it left my thinking far more than Blankets did. The way he uses arabic script is also really great  its like hes given the squiggles and abstract decoration you see in Blankets some actual context.,books,ctthcq7,2,t5_2qh4i

4757537,0,t1_ctu4twv,Hi Aussie!In a general sense I know most of the main events that transpire in the books and some of them Ive known since before I started writing them. But the devil is in the details as the saying goes.  There are characters who took over their roles and interacted with other characters and the plot in way that I did not foresee.  Yet peculiarly the events did not stray that far from what I envisioned. They just came about in a very different way.  I dont do a detailed outline when Im writing.  At some point in the book I start creating what I call the map to the end of the book which is a list of chapters to come and the main events in them.  I never feel bound by that however. I think if I wrote a heavily detailed outline Id become bored writing the book itself.  I like to see the story unfolding as I write it.  Of course that can sometimes be disastrous.  More than once Ive had to discard  or  pages of text when I ran the story into a detour that didnt work.,books,ctu8ebg,19,t5_2qh4i

4785751,0,t1_ctxq0pf,given the wordplay the made up words words that were used in new ways the multitude of puns... and then you accept that people were indeed gettin high back then hash was more common from what i understand but that doesnt mean the guy couldnt have been smokin some trees and it starts to seem like a somewhat less silly assertion.as for the many owners over many years... the article says the pipes were discovered in an excavation which implies that they were buried probably not on purpose and so during the excavation it would be pretty standard archaeology to take note of how far down they were buried. by doing that it becomes possible to determine approx. how long ago the item was buried. given a knowledge of the houses history its not hard to compare approximate age of the object with the owner history and be fairly confident of who owned the house when the items ended up in the garden. that being said theres no way of knowing that Shakespeare didnt just have a stoner infestation or a guest who was getting high in the garden all the time. maybe there was something about the location of his house that lead to stoners taking naps in his garden and dropping their shit. or maybe a later owner was trying to hide his stuff so he buried it in the garden. it could happen. all the article is really saying is that there is evidence that would suggest to a reasonably minded person that there is in fact a real possibility of the Bard having enjoyed some trees.and then theres this bit in the article.... In Sonnet  he writes about invention in a noted weed which could be interpreted to mean that Shakespeare was willing to use weed or cannabis while he was writing. i might be wrong but all these bits and pieces of information give me the feeling that Shakespeare like many famous wordsmiths of today probably liked to get a little high sometimes. ,books,ctxs7pl,63,t5_2qh4i

Without such a statement we simply dont know what THE meaning was.This is an operationalization but what were after is a definition. Or do you want the definition to be in terms of what we can observe? In that case many books simply dont have an objective meaning. Furthermore this definition makes critical analysis that tries to figure out the intentions of the author meaningless since in cases where we dont know the intentions of the author and hence there is no objective meaning to the work all interpretations will be subjective and as you pointed out above all subjective interpretations will be equally valid. This brings us back around to Barthes in most practical situations since most of the time we have no record of the authors intentions.gt Done and done. Glad I could help you with that. Unfortunately further explanations would require some philosophical coursework to provide the necessary foundation for understanding which is beyond the scope of this reddit.Were deep in a comment tree under a heavily downvoted top comment  I think its safe to say that the scope of this reddit is of no relevance anymore.

4876202,0,t1_cu957m2,I think youre exactly right about the difference between Foundation and the Robot series. The Robot series is more about individuals and unique situations as well as characterization. Whereas Foundation is about the overall shifts in a huge empire as a whole. The lack of memorable characters in Foundation is almost patently deliberate in this sense and its stated explicitly that Seldons predictions are not about individuals but the inevitable inertia of the empires population as a whole. Really depends on which type you like more. For me the Foundation perspective was very unique which is partly why I liked it more  very few stories give you a topdown view of an empire rather than focusing on individuals. ,books,cu96mj2,5,t5_2qh4i

The book requires a small amount of effortengagement in flipping back and forth due to footnotes. But the main one is that it doesnt have one clear plot. People like having a sequence of events spoonfed to them. I was talking to one girl last week who claims to like reading but stunned me with this comment New books are better than old ones. Ugh. She says she likes Faulkner but I suspect shes more into Hemingway. When I said thats true if you think plot is the only thing that matters and that you just want to get it as fast as possible she said yeah thats right!Id say after reading about ten maybe twenty novels that are all about the plot reading more like that really isnt worth your time. However some people like jerking their cerebellum off between the pages of a book.

4897431,0,t3_3hym6t,So Dantes character is a huge wuss but it fits in with the story. The transition to almost every Circle of Hell is that he gets frightened or hurt and passes out. Its quite silly.That said Dantes Inferno produces some of the coolest quotes. Most of them come from his guide Virgil. The story is kind of draggy in some points but it definitely pays out. When I read it in high school I enjoyed it but had a poor time paying attention to it. I wish I could say dont force yourself to read it because its definitely a book you want to soak in at your own pace but deadlines and stuff.Its really cool to pick apart the book in my opinion  to analyse all of it.

4901140,0,t3_3hym6t,I took an entire course on the divine comedy in college so it boggles my mind that theyre having you do it in high school. I only say this because theres SO many specifics and deep rooted concepts that I doubt will be expressed in your class. Dante was a man thoroughly involved in the world of his time and as such theres nothing but name drops and specific references that you otherwise wouldnt understand without research and some historical understanding. There are also a lot of specific things about Dantes understanding of the world I remember discussing how he had an infatuation with fractals and multiples of  and whatnot All in all I doubt theres as much expected of you as would be for a college course so if you find it enthralling I recommend some intense research. Otherwise Id say go with a general understanding of the punishments and whatever meaning you take from it. ,books,cucbsau,3,t5_2qh4i

I absolutely cant wait for the next one.That being said. There is a distinction difference in the quality of the writing between the two of those authors. So jumping from the quality of writing provided by Rothfuss into Mistborn. It could honestly probably make the quality of writing from Mistborn feel even worse than it is. The quality of writing from Mistborn is average. That is not Sandersons strong suite. I loved both though.

Losing his job at the university would not be the end of literature for him. You might well be right about the lack of ability to imagine another life for himself though.gtVery tragic book.Eh. Not really how I would understand the term tragic. I expected it to be tragic when I started reading. I expected it to be like The Remains of the Day a quiet private intimate tragedy. But I think two things stop it from being tragic the first is that Stoners life doesnt go downwards as all tragic heroes lives do.

There are plenty of books I dont like too including some which are hailed as classics.I find it strange though when you talk of that writing style not being okay as if its unacceptable that something you dont personally enjoy should dare to exist.EDIT As for intelligence I love Ulysses but Im sure my intelligence is not exceptional and falls within the normative range. I mean do you really think you didnt like it because you arent smart enough to enjoy it? Why not just say it wasnt to your taste?About the understanding angle youre not expected to understand every little reference.

4970203,0,t1_cul0083,Good question! Living in Vietnam one of the few Communist countries left on Earth I understood the meaning of socialism for the first time. I am a socialist because I believe that the common people should have collective ownership of resources. All laws should at their core be designed with that in mind. In the U.S. were taught that socialismcommunism is antifreedom because wealth is shared and the government is powerful. However in practice I found a society designed around the wellbeing of the commoner to be much much more free than the socalled free market merchant economy that we have. We are controlled by capital it is the primary backbone of all laws and institutions whereas in a socialism capital is secondary. The backbone of all laws and institutions in socialism is the empowerment of the commoner which I believe to be just.However one of the major problems with socialism is that when virtually the entire rest of the world is capitalistic it becomes nearly impossible to stay socialist. People are unfortunately inherently attracted to wealth. Thus youre absolutely right that the social position advantages experienced by expats there particularly men are based on an exploitation of wealth differences. I partook heavily in that exploitation but learned ultimately that it came at the price of my soul.,books,cul14oz,1,t5_2qh4i

Fuck anyone who cares that they cant read anymore or who feels bad about the guy having fucking Alzheimerspretty much the worst disease since it kills your soul not your body.Its intentionally inflammatoryhe could have made his point without picking out anyone. He admitted he didnt even have a beef with Prachett yet shat on his grave anyways. It doesnt actually defend his position. He says Prachett isnt literature but thats it. Hell he doesnt even argue what value literature has. Its just that he apparently likes the prose of some authorswhich has absolutely nothing to do with whether they are good literature. Literature is about how it informs the culture. The Bible isnt wellwritten either.Its hipster bragging hes there to brag about the authors hes read in the past and how much more cultured he is because Prachett is the last person he would read.If you cant see the problem with his article I can see why you are downvoted so often.

So old and fragile when he falls from his throne...he just falls apart.He was supposed to be similar to Lucifer in that he was a normal angel who desired power and so put himself above the others and ruled. This is essentially an allusion to the Pope.Anyway Phillip Pullman said the novels arent proreligious at all nor antireligious. Theyre a criticism of how religion is used. He hates how so many families and churches essentially brainwash children from a young age instead of letting them make those choices when they get older.Direct quote on the matter of religion  In my view belief in God seems to be a very good excuse on the part of those who claim to believe for doing many wicked things that they wouldnt feel justified in doing without such a belief.He has great disdain for organized religion as an institution or organization. Religion isnt free anymore  look at churches. Theyre  basically banks. How much money do you think they rake in every year?

Such as a character in the book could be Asian or Black but the publishing company would represent the character as white. Which I do think is a bit problem.I also think when subjects like this come up people get so defensive and assume that by suggesting books could be more diverse that it means that we should read diverse books in place of books by white male authors. Which isnt the case at all.When I address this topic this is how I tackle it I make it my personal goal to read more diversely.

5061897,0,t3_3k8af8,I read Lives of Girls and Women two years ago and Im currently reading Dance of the Happy Shades. What I love most about Munro is the effortlessness she exhibits in giving her characters depth and perspective. You could fool yourself into believing she were writing about real people which Im sure she was for some stories but even the ones not based in fact still have that abundant characterization. Im finding that with her its not so much plot that drives her but the way the people in her stories think and grow along the way. How they react or dont to strange realities or sudden calamities. She does it so wonderfully and she doesnt have to be showy about it either.With Munro though I do that find you cant zoom through her work. You cant fully appreciate her without appreciating the finer details first and to do that you need to absorb her words much more carefully than usual. Otherwise you may miss an important aspect of a story that needs to be understood in order to make the whole work blossom as a whole. Novelists have a lot more space and time to do that but short story writers have only a set limit to their worlds. The ins and outs of their vision amass only a handful of pages before another vision comes.

When did you last see a democrat get elected by saying what we need to do is spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on glass plates and then shatter them because it looks cool? No one is for wasteful spending. The difference is what people consider wasteful spending. Some people on the right might suggest that social aid programs are wasteful whereas someone on the left would think theyre important. The same applies here. No one things that excessive regulation is good. But people on the left and people on the right have different ideas about what regulation is considered excessive. Some people think business need less regulation so they can thrive and stimulate the economy. Some people think they need more regulation because their workers should have more benefits than companies are willing to provide. ,books,cuys4x1,2,t5_2qh4i

They need to make sure their metadata marks erotica correctly so that it can be filtered out of agesensitive search results.I suspect part of the problem is that Kindle authors uploading free books might be a bit lax about filling in the metadata and theres not much financial incentive for Amazon or the author to go to the trouble of checking this. Given the volume of titles Amazon sells especially in the free and under areas its unworkable to have staff checking all those titles.

What people should be doing is saving that money in a bank where its a available to them in emergencies and b not already committed to purchasing something they may not want several months later. gtLayaway is a smart way of doing it a little bit over time so you dont drain yourself while still being able to get a nice thing every once in a while.The smart way of doing it a little bit over time is taking  out of every paycheck and putting it in a separate bank account  or even stuffing it under a mattress.

I could sit and just read away all the pain that I was dealing with.

5250783,0,t1_cvimnts,Could you expand on your first thought about social media? Id also like to ask how you define pretension?I find that social media and the internet actually helps with language and thinking processes. An easy example would be here and now youre asking for analytical views on  on a social media website. Also your example of Twitter has twosides information can rapidly disseminate through the world there are multiple sources to find information and if an individual considers the civilian community that information isnt censored. I would also make an argument for E.L James and John Green but Im digressing from the topic at hand. Your argument is valid the use of propaganda is a dangerous tool in a politicians belt its a tactic that destroys ones perception of reality but thats not the entirety of the nuance in Orwells essay. Slovenly language can be interpreted to how the individual speaks about things within everyday life how certain places are called ghettos how men should be men or how every Muslim is a terrorist. Grand sweeping overarching thoughts that circulate by the populaces speech. These stereotypes are easy for a politician to manipulation normal because we dont even need to think about them and give people the power to hurt other because theyre not following a status quo. Its another possible way to interpret his quote because he doesnt define who hes addressing. ,books,cviwpk6,2,t5_2qh4i

It boggles my mind that people dont want this.The Shakespeare I am familiar with  as in have read enough annotations to know all the proper meaning  I adore so much I can almost never be bored of it. But the language stops me from watching some of the more obscure plays all the time.  I think its ridiculous how some people in this very thread are arguing that Shakespeare isnt that hard to get when as the article points out without annotations some of his phrases are utterly opaque.When I watch Shakespeare I know less I spend a good chunk of mental energy contextualizing soliloquies so that even if I miss such an opaque word or phrase like the articles character example I get the overall tone and meaning.Fuck that.  I want to enjoy every gooey nugget of witty brilliance without conscious concern for something as basic as my comprehension.

5258099,0,t1_cvjffoc,I thought that was a great ending  they realized that They couldnt control the power  the human mind was too unpredictable and irrational to use it  and so they would continue to manifest dangerous and violent things unwillingly.   A time paradox would occur if humanity at large learned of the power...   ...so either everyone they told about it would die or they had to forget and give up the power.s So really the book was much more about the human psyche than aliens and magic powers.

By the time it does the assassination is rushed and such a let down. He had the opportunity to use his talents as a story teller to create any scenario he wanted and instead he gives us absolutely nothing of interest.  And then in the most condescending afterword Ive ever read admonishes people for believing anything other than the official report of the assasination. His descriptions of Dallas were also a little harsh which I didnt think were so harsh until his reasoning at the end of the book which just came across as ...mean.,books,cvr8sza,1,t5_2qh4i

We were forced to read books in both but only the students who really loved reading took Literature on where we studied deeper books and in greater depth. Perhaps they could implement a system in schools where those two classes exist but in the compulsory English class they only encourage rather than force reading. Perhaps they could make you choose to read a book out of a list and instead of analysing and writing papers on it you just have to write a book review stating whether you liked it or not. I think that would be a good compromise. I dont believe they shouldnt abolish compulsory reading altogether as a lot of kids especially in this generation need a bit of encouraging to learn to enjoy reading. We arent born with an appetite to read so unless our parents push it on us the education system is the last hope for getting young readers into it.,books,cw17z9d,2,t5_2qh4i

5516242,0,t3_3qn3a0,I started reading books again in my early s. I used to get a lot of C grades on my papers. I am ESL and struggle with grammar generally because its not part of the daily language. But after awhile Ive noticed that I started to get an A on my papers and a lot of positive comments. I attribute this to reading. I spend a lot of time reading books on history and I do pick up a few words here and there. For example Ill be reading something and stumble upon a word that I dont understand a lot of the time I skip it because I get the overall idea but sometimes I pause and check the dictionary to see the exact meaning. This has allowed me to expand my vocabulary slowly. One time I was in the company of my friends drinking and just having a good time there were a lot of fucks thrown around but one of my buddies stopped and pointed out to another friend that I use proper English. I guess he has noticed that my vocabulary goes beyond curse words. Actually this is a good example that I recall now it annoyed me greatly at the time. I was in the English class and we had to do a group survey about something which is not important for this story but Ive used a word lexicon in my group paper and this threw everybody off.. They didnt know what it meant. Some people made a remark about me using that word and that annoyed me. I wasnt trying to show off or anything like that I just used the word in a sentence without a second thought but I guess it was too mind blowing for some students. Here I am ESL student with a much richer lexicon vocabulary than the rest of my native speaking peers. Anyway I think reading and writing helped a lot. Anywhere from conveying my ideas more clearly to enrichment of my vocabulary. My second passion is software and programming so I think that Ive seen some improvements there as well. Writing software is actually very similar to writing a good academic paper. ,books,cwgr09a,3,t5_2qh4i

Mary teaches Lyra about falling in love and gives her the fruit that she feeds to Will before they kiss and cause the second fall. In PL an angel appears to banish Adam and Eve from paradise after the fall but offers hope that mankind has the potential to return to grace.

Theyve raked in a cool couple billion dollars during their run so far.However I wouldnt say theyre on the same level as Harry Potter simply because the writing in my opinion is not equivalent.  Main characters within The Hunger Games series seem to devolve as the story progresses with Katniss our main protagonist becoming much less of a downtrodden underdog and much more of a lovesick teenager.  On the other hand we have the Harry Potter series which remains steadfast from beginning to end in my opinion again.Also take a look at the universes.  One is a multifaceted phenomenon that drags a reader in with its immense detail and believability.  The Hunger Games?  Not necessarily bad but certainly not equal.  One series THG is good for a single readthrough and a viewing of the movies.  The other HP almost requires a second experience simply to appreciate the attention to detail and vastness of the world JK Rowling created.But hey then again Im biased.

5590645,0,t3_3roira,A lot of whats zeitgeist popular now will fade right into obscurity in  years. I think that what will stick will be ecological SF among other things. If one takes a look at any list of top  classics there are actually quite a number of them which fit under SF or Fantasy. Thats because the human story telling tradition when you get right down to fictions heart is all about imagination and these things will never go away.  You can have your Suzanne Collins and your Harry Potter and Zombie attack novels  these things are all the rage now and wont be in  years. But Jules Verne will remain in  and Mary Shelly will be scaring readers then too long after Cormack McCarthy is forgotten.  If you forced me to choose something from the current era Id have to pick Gene Wolfe and Ursula K LeGuin. Neither writer is young but both are still writing and both are writing in a manner far removed from most of the chaff that is being released. They and other authors like them explicitly trust that you the reader are no moron and do not need hand waving infodumps or dots connected words defined. They forgo all of this fluff for the meat of the story and more importantly  what is being said beneath the words on the page  and do so in a robust intelligent manner. This kind of story is not as popular as easyreading YA but it will outlast it.  Moreover Fantasy does not need any legitimizing. It may just now be resurging in popularity in the mainstream but has always been legitimate from the time we invented writing.,books,cwq2lpb,-3,t5_2qh4i

5653770,0,t3_3sjahm,TammyI participated in your last AMA and was delighted to find that I had not missed this next one. As previously stated your work has done so much for my life and Ive passed it on to other such individuals in my family that were in need of some fantasy life guidance. Ive debated admitting this however I confess that the lasting impact of your work led me to years ago have a tattoo done on the back of my neck of the crow line art that was stamped into the front hard covers of the Tricksters series. It is small and done in nearly a skin tone however it serves as a reminder of how far Ive come.My question to you is have you ever thought about producing shorter stage versions of your stories? I believe that quite a few of them would lend themselves very well to theatre. Another question that I have is in the spirit of November have you ever participated in NaNoWriMo?Thank you for all the wonders that you have produced.,books,cwxwlt8,1,t5_2qh4i
5654335,0,t3_3sjahm,Dear Mrs. PierceYour books radically changed my life. I reread the Lioness Quartet annually and I am now  and always finish with a fulfilling reminder of my own power. I love that Alanna was flawed. I love that she worked her ASS off to get better. I love her persistence.When I was in college I took up fencing and was thoroughly annoyed with my arm getting tired so quickly. I didnt have a heavier sword to use but used her trick by taking a lb weight to practice extensions until the real foil weighed nothing.My Question Most of your books focus on preteens and tend to end as they reach adulthood.

Being an ignorant high school brat I didnt read the book and frankly Im glad I didnt back then. When I moved back from college I happened to run in to the book again.  year old me couldnt care less about politics but  year old me had dove straight in to politics and was staunchly Democrat. If you know anything about Pat Buchanan then you know any Democrat would burn anything of his on sight. However I had a decent amount of time extremely opinionated and had a bunch of pot.  I plowed through it in less than  days and found myself questioning not only my own political opinions but looking at the world through a very different lense.

5751383,0,t3_3ttlp1,Jim Dale master race!Honestly though I think people should be given the choice. For many of us the narrator was our first exposure to the world of Harry Potter. Itd be like having the lead roles played by someone else in the films and expecting people to be fine with it. His reading brought the stories to life you cant be asked to switch. And what about parents who want to share the magic they remembered. I searched for hours on audible to find the narration of White Fang that I grew up with as a child. All the top listings were too peppy for prose about the Wild the savage frozenhearted Northland Wild. The oppressive cruelty of the canadian wilderness that made the novel so memorable was lost.

The first way is for man to acknowledge death while living with faith that there is purpose faith that is not necessarily defined by religion but by a belief in a manmade meaning a greater purpose. OR man can deal with lifes struggles without giving thought to purpose having no belief AND having no thought of having no belief.Anyone who doesnt fall into these two categories will eventually fall victim to reason which concludes that nothing we do matters.

So the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable.Shall be telling doesnt mean one hasnt done the thing yet. It means one hasnt told the story about this time with this two roads.equally layin leave  I read that as meaning at that morning no one had yet taken either road. One can still be less travelled. the passing there  Had worn them really about the same.  Specifically references the passing there. Which I read to mean the juncture of the two roads where people had to decide which road to take. Up to that point everyone is the same. It is afterwards where there is the road less traveled.I dont interpret it at all to the road equally traveled. In any event since the author says poems are meant to be interpreted not proven that interpretation admits a range of possibilities how can he claim that a popular interpretation is a misreading?

Though poetry and music certainly have many similarities they are distinctly different entities. Id also like to add that there is an intensely thriving contemporary poetry scene which stands mostly apart from contemporary music. The author of this article doesnt include this I presume because he is more interested in the memorization of classical literature. To equate contemporary music to todays poetry isnt exactly correct because there is a whole world of incredibly complex poetry which is still being produced...and which functions on a completely different level than song lyrics. also if were talking about equivalencies those who write spoken wordslam poetry typically memorize their own poems. So its not a practice completely stuck in the past.,books,cxkamj0,4,t5_2qh4i

A book can be read in its entirety by one person with a great voice or one with a bad voice.  Also chapters can be read by different people some with great voices and some without.It doesnt really bother me except when some with a heavy accent is using it as a way to practice their english.But I very much support the open source nature of the approach so I tend to not be choosey.  Also I am more focused on the story than the readers ability.Give it a shot they are all free.  Heck if you have the free time consider donating by reading some books that you consider worthy of sharing with others as long as they are public domain as most of the best works are.Oh there is a book out about Pierre Picaud called The Black Count by Tom Reiss.

That is the point. The fact that it is challenging is part of what makes it great literature.gt The school is guided by Quaker philosophy the Philadelphia Inquirer reported and peaceful resolution of conflicts seeking truth and collaboration are key aspects of its operation.So instead of finding solutions you choose to whitewash over the cracks in historys loadbearing wall and proclaim it fixed? Fantastic. I sure hope The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is the next to go so we can just wait for the peace to roll in the door.gt I really do believe that this is an opportunity for the school to step forward and listen to the students.Oh perfect lets listen to what children want to learn or not want to learn when attempting to teach them about the difficult and complex nature of life.

At the crux though you as a hypothetical business owner need to find a way to take an amount of capital and turn it into more. This is done by finding some efficiency somewhere. I agree there should be regulations as we have in the US on how many hours you can have your employee work and for how much. Im not trying to pass moralist judgement on you making the profit from your business. I am highly anti pure socialism for the obvious reasons of no incentives.This started by someone stating capitalism should not be the target of the article. I simply feel that in a fairly free market environment you will always find people with wealth looking for every opportunity to gain more. This is why capitalism as a theory works people opersting in their own self interest its human nature. When you start looking into regions where the government is weaker it really allows for this negative aspect to be on full display. At least this is the sense I got from Savianos Gomorrah and my very broad strokes understanding of the drug trade in S. America would make me guess a similar situation is occurring.Cheers to you this holiday season. ,books,cycg9gn,1,t5_2qh4i

Child porn Billions of people living in absolute poverty Drinking draino.I never said that the United States is responsible for it what I was implying is that you really should A read the fucking article and B recognize that US citizens are involved in the global drug trade. Millions of them as consumers a smaller percentage as workers and some of those workers are providing specialized skills and high tech weaponry to what are rather large criminal enterprises.Nothing Im saying should come as a shock and this guys article is bad because its based on the premise that it should come as a shock and even worse it has the dependency in reverse. If it wasnt for the government inflating the price of drugs through an artificial barrier to entry none of this would be an issue.Anyway carry on and TITS or GTFO.,books,cycgdcb,1,t5_2qh4i

Is your implication that its only been successful because they went so fast?Plenty of shows have plot lines that advance much more slowly and they do just fine. The should could have been plenty successful at a slower pace spending more time on parts of the story they glossed over.gtImagine the difference between Philosophers Stone Matthew Lewis and Deathly Hallows Part  Matthew Lewis happening for a character thats supposed to have aged some  years and you may appreciate why the show cant drag itself out.Its amusing that you turned to a franchise that timed it just right so that they had published source material before each movie and specifically an actor most people think had a very favorable advantage by growing up.Are there people who care greatly about the age of the kids in HP?

I know its a trope of the mystery genre but it makes me wonder... is  Poirot some sort of supernatural being that feeds off the mystery and misery of humans? Is he drawn to suffering of human beings?

6159720,0,t1_cyobhk3,Lets just understand that I dont use any of these methods myself due to the fact that I find them unnecessary. Lets further understand that a closed fist against anyone not threatening your life is probably always a bad idea. Im ok with a level of agression balanced with the need of a person to assert themselves. Too passive is probably not good either. Immediate compliance is the entire point. You are being punished for noncompliant behavior. This prepares children for a world where continued noncompliance will be punished but not always with a physical undertone. Maybe you sped. Maybe you shoplifted. You are noncompliant with societys rules and will be punished. You are of course still free to make the decision but you cannot escape the punishment for it. If you can successfully explain this to a four year old Im all ears. But a swat across the backside is wonderful in terms of immediate understanding. There is a difference between abuse and discipline. Id argue that normal spanking probably never reaches abuse. I learned early that disrespectful backtalk ended up with a handprint on my cheek. I learned how to express myself without being disrespectful of someones opinion.  You look at someone disciplining their child as always abusive whereas I just look at someone who doesnt know they need to teach their child that the punishment is for breaking the rules not because they are angry. ,books,cypsowh,0,t5_2qh4i

6221031,0,t3_40ov7p,I have two three books that I could say got me hooked although not really from the first pages. Also when I say hooked I mean not so much having the impulse to read through them because I do that with every book that I find to my liking  but most importantly a book which makes me get truly immersed in the story not just pay attention and get curious what happens next.One was Hyperion  which I read after finally deciding its time to do it because its so well praised and reviewed and which I avoided because I had the feeling that its some silly soft scifi space opera not a fan. When I decided to pick it up out of duty as a scifi fan I got interested when I read more about the structure and initially was a bit reserved but got hooked during the first pages of the Priests Tale and before I knew I was going through the pages like crazy. Mostly because it turned out to be something completely different from what I expected but also because the Priests Tale is a great mystery tale that works excellent both as a starter and both as an introduction to the story. Hyperion achieved something which Simmons never repeated with his novels IMO although I enjoy his style. The best example in terms of movies I could give  for meaningful comparison  would be the Matrix. Initially was nah... what is this film all about ok lets go see it.. and then... oO and I stayed for the other three even though neither came even close Animatrix though... just like the other three books in the series.The other book was Anathem  which I read as a follow up to House of Leaves if you read... then read.... Not a huge fan of Stephenson as a writer but the construction of the world the language and the hidden philosophies got me hooked not so much on the story but on the puzzle.  To this day it remains my only Stephensons book which I can say I genuinely enjoyed in a sense thats a bit more than well that wasnt a total waste of time... although as far as the story goes it was the usual Stephenson crap P   If I was to compare it to a movie Id say Upstream Colour  a bizarre  and bit pointless production by Caruth which nevertheless had me stop everything I was doing and trying to figure just what the hell this thing is all about.  Even now Id say that as a film its pretty... pointless... but Ill be damned if I ever denied that it was one of the few movies I really watched closely. I planned on watching it with one eye on the screen and the other on my work and ended up just watching it in total confusion and surprise. Well theres Anathem for you if you have a stomach for it.As for the other books I like reading books so sooner or later each gets me hooked to a degree. Id have a list of books which I had to force myself through.... but thats another story. EDIT On a second thought Id have to include Blindsight because it was the closest I ever got to the same experience I had when I first read Lovecrafts stories with sketchesP as a twelveyearold kid. Lovecraft is too ubiquitous today and everything gets you hooked as a kid but this book really drew me in purely on the atmosphere and execution which I found to be surprisingly fresh. Guess even today not everyone can be HPL POh and be a good parent and read HPL to your kids!  Teach them the value of forbidden knowledge and scar the motherfuckers for life!

The real problem here is one of the reasons why gtthe belief that intimate relations between Jews and nonJews threatens the separate identity.Edit I should clarify  I do still have my doubts about this story. If the other reasons it was dropped were because it was poorly written or had unnecessary violence or sexual references that would be inappropriate for the agegroup I wouldnt want them to overturn their decision.

Garden of Eden on the other hand goes even farther and it strips away so much of the detail that only on reflection do we realize is extraneous to the feel of the moment as well as the story.  Its Hemingway in broad brushstrokes.  I dont know if it was intentional or its the bones of the story yet to be fully fleshed out in detail.  It is interesting a compelling story and in its own way interesting but for me it was the contrast with his body of work that made if worthwhile.

6262302,0,t1_cz0g7o3,Didnt know that about the Adem! Interesting. I actually already knew about most of the restI used to follow a reread over at Tor hosted by Jo Walton. We got more than kneedeep into a lot of this stuff. But your comment really helped bring back that spark I used to feel when reading and pondering about these books. I already commented elsewhere that I had a few issues and reservations regarding some of Pats pacing and language choices for the latter Im talking outside of Kvothes narrative so the frame storyI just feel some of the flowery language and highmetaphoric imagery which I do love and am guilty of constantly could be scaled back a bit to let more of the real magic of subtlety come into play. And after reading TNotW and WMF so many times I got fed up about certain smaller issues and ultimately ended up abandoning fantasy as a genre for a long while which may have had less to do with the books themselves and more with what was going on in my life at that time. While my relationship with fantasy is still somewhat shaky Im looking forward to diving back into this series once more. I just hope you realize that youre partly to blame for my becoming an asocial hermit for a couple weeks!Edit to add that I hope someday Rothfuss follows up on his idea to pen a series or at least novella from Dennas perspective.

6263330,0,t1_cz1hsnz,The problem is that what the SF guys think is good is normally what the lit guys think is shit and viceversa.Im a lit guy mostly. And thats why I love......William Gibson. He can turn a phrase beautifully and his use of voice is astounding. After that comes Tim Winton Peter Carey and Terry Pratchett...But while Gibson can sculpt words amazingly...hes still Science Fiction. And the lit guys as were all aware fuckin hate science fiction. Arent enough heroinaddicted teenage rape victims in it probably the Australian lit scene is big on Misery Lit or as I like to call it Mournography. And yes in general the science fiction writing  the actual sentences and words and the bare mechanics of it all  is terrible and comparable to a childrens fiction. Character development often takes a secondary role behind the technology with humans in the story often only there to press buttons to make shiny laser shine.  In uni creative writing course... I was stuck in the uncomfortable nether world between the Lit Wankers and the SciFi Nerds. In class since I was The Asianish Guy With Glasses Who Made The Mistake Of Mentioning He Likes William Gibson the literarytype tutors loved pairing me up to edit the works of all the comp sci and engineering types who were taking the subject as an elective. Oh you like Gibson? Hes sci fi right? Then youll be with Eustace over there hes a Physics major who would love someone like you to go over his word first chapter of what he refers to as Tome the First of his eightpart series of novels he delightfully calls The Saturnian Machination Cycle Iteration I.And Id die a little inside. And Eustace would ask me if Ive read any scifi before and Id say I love Gibson and then wait for the inevitable...But you know hes not really a science fiction author. He writes fruity his books are too short to go into any real depth and anyway cyberpunks not really science fiction  its too simplistic. So I dont expect to understand my work as its proper science fiction as I am doing physics you know.Then the next thing Id know is that uni security is prying my hands off Eustaces throat. OK maybe I made that bit up. There I was stuck in the doldrums neither Lit Wanker nor Spec Fic Nerd hated by both admired by none. So Ive seen both the belligerents trench lines most because I was stuck in a shell crater in the no mans land between. I use Gibson as a classic case because he should be a bridge between the two worlds instead hes simply seen by one side as an enemy agent sent by the other. It would be perfectly possible to have literary science fiction  I submit All Tomorrows Parties as Exhibit A  but both sides too easily dismiss the other. And what one side holds up as a shining example of their art...it will be the complete antithesis of everything the other side likes.,books,cz1kk8w,46,t5_2qh4i
6264455,0,t3_41cx6z,I feel like the big difference between contemporary scifi and contemporary proper literature is that the scifi tends to be very plotbased and actionoriented. Not so much about the human condition but more about thoughtprovoking ideas. Although the line can be blurred. Think of the difference between The Windup Girl and Oryx and Crake. One of them is obviously fasterpaced and built on suspense while the other is slower more poetic and thematically deep. I dont think theres anything wrong with either of them but I think they set out to do different things. Margaret Atwood is going to be more wellreceived by literary critics because shes a great fucking writer but that doesnt mean The Windup Girl is any less good of a book  it just doesnt even pretend to have the same literary qualities.You might also compare TV shows based on books ha  The Expanse versus Game of Thrones. I think the drama of the latter is far more accessible it coming from a quasihistorical context that we can all readily understand where the former requires really listening to the show learning the rules of the world and considering their implications for our characters. The Expanse also requires a lot more exposition about the world that goes beyond the specific motivations for characters.I guess what Im getting at is that scifi often finds itself in a ghetto because a lot of the time its more about ideas than people and people relate more readily to stories about people than ideas.,books,cz1p5ty,5,t5_2qh4i
6266251,0,t1_cz1s0cp,Yup. And there can be blurring of the genres. When theres a scientific approach to magical phenomena the story feels more like scifi. Like the Ted Chiang story I mentioned. Not just a story with phenomena but phenomena that is examined tested for which characters seek understanding of the principals behind it where that seeking of knowledge is an important part of who the characters are andor necessary for the plot.And when theres a fantasy approach to scientific concepts it feels more like a fantasy. Like if you can move things with your mind because certain special people are attuned to a mystical energy and everyone in that story just accepts that as fact without any effort being done to research why certain minds are more attuned and what exactly is this mysterious energy and can it be harnessed and controlled like electricity for example? If theres no scientific investigation it feels more like a fantasy no matter how many robots and spaceships are in it. Especially if the mysterious energy seems to care whether youre using it for good or for evil. Thats a fantasy approach. Phenomena are used by the characters but how they actually work isnt important and in fact its common that investigation and testing and asking too many questions is discouraged. These are just generalities and very specific to how I personally view stories. I do feel that there are many many stories that are capable of being told in more than one setting but I also believe that genre can mean something more substantial than the set dressing. Does the writer want to tell a sciencefiction story with science at its core or does the writer want to tell a romance set in space? ,books,cz1wipf,3,t5_2qh4i

6273303,0,t1_cz2j3af,If you had asked me a few years ago when I was reading it Im sure I would have had many more specific reasons but looking back three major problems I had stick with me. Editing  this book is bloated and some significant editing could have tightened the book up to improve the pacing.  It seems like some publishers let their big names just publish whatever they want knowing it will sell but everyone can benefit from some quality editing and King is among those who really could benefit from an editor to help him not let some of his bad writing habits hurt his final product.. The characters feel flat and static  the characters face very few challenges and the ones they do face do very little to change them. They start two dimensional and while they may questions themselves or their motivations from time to time they always just went back to what they were already doingwho they already were. The ending  something King is notorious for but the ending felt tacked on and not thought out.  After pushing through hundreds of pages in hopes of improvement once the main action was over I was pretty sure there was no more hope for improvement but somehow it got even worse.If I squint a bit I can see what people who are looking for something different from their reading can get out of this book but for me its probably turned me off of reading King either ever or for a very very long time. Really not my cup of tea.,books,cz2pcfz,1,t5_2qh4i

Pretty fun main character who ends up helping ghosts that have gone through some pretty messed up stuff. For an excellent modern epic fantasy a common recommendation is the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. Original coming of age story that is fresh and has excellent prose.Brandon Sanderson is another popular fantasy author. I recommend starting with a novella or a stand alone novel as his other works are quite long. I really enjoyed The Emperors Soul by him it was very well done.Phillip K. Dicks novels are a little hard to follow but several of them are dark involve drug use and altered realities and have paranoid characters.I havent read them but Jim Butchers The Dresden Files might also be up your alley. ,books,cz6zbzq,1,t5_2qh4i

6344934,0,t1_czahw2c,I suppose each to his own but Douglas Adams also agrees with Orwell spot ongtThere is a very simple principle to the making of tea and its this  to get the proper flavour of tea the water has to be boiling not boiled when it hits the tea leaves. If its merely hot then the tea will be insipid. Thats why we English have these odd rituals such as warming the teapot first so as not to cause the boiling water to cool down too fast as it hits the pot. And thats why the American habit of bringing a teacup a tea bag and a pot of hot water to the table is merely the perfect way of making a thin pale watery cup of tea that nobody in their right mind would want to drink.,books,czaukbi,12,t5_2qh4i

6348489,1,t3_42k19o,People who listen instead of read are missing out on some of the emergent properties of written fiction personallyconceived voices tone volume urgency even accent sometimes. Listeners are getting the McDonalds of experiencing fiction each of them the exact same experience while readers experience a unique work.Likewise short of extremely rare decentlybudgeted dramatic readings or radio adaptations audiobooks are read by one at best two readers neither of whom have an adequate range of voices and who are incapable of expressing certain things. For example in sciencefiction or fantasy telepathy is often described as being understood more than heard therefore having it spoken out loud somewhat defeats that. When someone is described as thundering speech few audiobook readers are going to actually portray that but in your head you can.So listening is the objectively inferior experience. Theres no real doubt about that. It isnt the same as reading no matter how much fans might want it to be. Its a shame that some people feel stigmatized by others refusing to stop acknowledging differences between experiences but thats a personal issue they need to work on not something thats going to or should change. Not everything is equal and admitting it is fine.Obviously people shouldnt go out of their way to bully others for their choice but when in a discussion of reading people discuss the difference audiobook fans who stumble across it and feel hurt dont get to demand that conversation stop any more than cripples would get to stifle discussion of how awesome hiking is.Likewise if the choice is between not experiencing books at all or listening obviously listening is better than not. But when the choice is between reading or listening youre not going to get people to stop pretending that choosing the lesser experience is strange.Lifes not fair. Not everything is created equal.

6366559,0,t1_czd5e8w,gtAs I stated Im not proving science through circular reasoning.And yet you literally said earlier that the validity of the scientific method can be verified by means of the scientific method itself. If that isnt circular what is?gtRather science is defined as a system where we test everything and throw away that which doesnt work and keep the things that function.Test according to what? Doesnt work by what metric? Function by what account? You cant just say this works or this functions without some qualification implied or otherwise. Religions works very well qua religion.gtSo the notion of success or this is working is presupposed in order to define science along with the understanding that acts have consequences and that identical acts lead to identical consequences what I called rationality in my earlier post.Yes and Im saying youve provided no explanation meaningful or not of what these things are or how we might determine what is and is not successful or working.gtIf you have any problem with the definition of what works you shouldnt talk to a scientist but perhaps a linguist.I dont have a problem with the definition of working I have a problem with your problematic application of it. You say that science produces things that work. Im not sure in this instance what you mean by working sans any further description but I will be charitable and take it that you mean that it works insofar as it produces results e.g. theories that make accurate repeatable predictions about the natural world. Fine but how exactly would we evaluate the natural so as to confirm that our theories conform to it without doing science itself?gtThe interesting thing is that everyone will resfilt agree on what it means even if the definition can be difficult to use a quote first applied to pornography Ill know it when I see it!This is empty rhetoric. I know what working means. Im asking how you are evaluating whether something is working in the first place.gtAn easy example would be building a house. A house built on sound scientific principles will stand up to winds and such fairly well while a house of bricks haphazardly thrown together wont. Afterwards its readily apparent to any onlooker which way worked and which didnt no matter what culture they are from. A tentative definition of the term might be if the result was the same as your intention or at least similar enough to leave you satisfied. But again defining the word isnt science though science is defined through the word.Medieval astronomers could use precisely the same argument about the geocentric model. It did demonstrably work. In fact at the time of Galileo the geocentric model actually provided more accurate data given the tools they had available to them. In light of this could we say that geocentric generated truths about the natural world given that it was practically useful elsewhere? Youre simply not answering the question. Im not interested in practical applications of science for the purpose of this discussion I want to know how you are going to prove from within science at that that science successfully generates truths about the natural world.gtEDIT The difference between science and religion of course is that science can be applied. To building a house for instance. If we only ever keep ourselves within the realm of religion whatever that means its clear that religion is enough to solve the problems we encounter.You think that using theology to answer theological questions is not application?,books,czdb36f,5,t5_2qh4i

The kids are promoting books with minority characters not suppressing books without them. Ideally books with all sorts of minorities will be available. And no one will even have to think about identifying with this or that. Itll just be people everywhere.

Childrens books are expected to feature multiple races say for multiculturalism as though race is identical to culture with the exception of racially monochromatic books featuring minority races.The old multiculturalism can only happen by force and micromanagement.  Again these kids arent saying Harry Potter shouldnt be a kids book because its not diverse enough. gtThis is supposed to balance the purported racist general depiction of majority races.

PJ did a mostly great job with LotR and having a three hour film for each ish page book depending on version. But the Hobbit is a shorter book than all three of the LotR books so a single hour or even . hour film would have been sufficient. It would have made a beautiful succinct and accurate rendition had he been interested in doing so as opposed to trying to milk the series for more money. I completely support C Tolkiens disgust in what PJ did to that book.,books,czgdsnf,5,t5_2qh4i

6406248,0,t1_czhsr5t,Its funny. Given what an excellent observer of people and their motivations she is it almost begs the question of why so much banality would have been included in the piece which in turn begs the question of whether our appreciation for the exceedingly fine points of the novel are somehow deepened by all that surrounds them.  I read something interesting recently that said our happy moments are happier when they are punctuated by less enjoyed things. The example was given of commercials during a television show with each notdesired commercial heightening the viewers appreciation for the entertaining segments of the show.  I wonder if our displeasure with the slow drawn out shallow portions of the book served to move our satisfaction with the deeply eloquent and poignant parts to adoration. ,books,czhtq5h,2,t5_2qh4i

Flagg is basically an immortal antagonist so he doesnt really die. I think King has said that Flagg is the embodiment of evil if you consider it in that light Id think that he cant die. I loved the slow build in The Stand and it actually is one of Kings better endings in my opinion I usually feel rather tepid about most of his endings.

6488370,0,t3_44fll0,This is just my personal experience with professionally diagnosed severe depression and CBT booksVery suicidal. Very depressed. Beginning to slack academically. Received counseling at school university. She recommended CBT and referred me to a psychiatrist. Looked CBT up because I didnt know what it was.Hated the psychiatrist. Did not have a good connection. He was very grating. Suggested CBT therapy groups and books as well. Dismissed CBT books again and stopped seeing psychiatrist and medication. Too depressed. No energy.Parents bought me a CBT book. I flipped through it indifferently. Read a book about meditative mindfulness written by a Vietnamese monk of my own volition. Helped.Suicide depression checked into ER psych ward. By this time several years have passed and Ive quit work and school. Finally began working with a good psychiatrist I feel comfortable with who also provides me with intensive therapy I see her  times weekly. This has been ongoing  years. Now consistent with medication. Received diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder recently and beginning an atypical antipsychotic soon.If I see a CBT book I feel a vague form of amusement and derision. If it helps you thats great. But if you are too sick to even attempt one exercise in the book like I was or even skim the bookflap dont beat yourself up.  The main thing is getting professional help. I never got into CBT therapy or read any of those books even in the beginning when everyone kept advocating it for me. I just didnt have the energy or willpower. It took many years and many different doctors to finally begin a professional treatment plan that has helped.If you have enough energy for CBTmindfultype books and not enough energyresources for professional help thats great too. Just get help any way you can and tell someone you trust about your state of mind and struggles. I didnt have energy for books or professional help for many years until I was at the very end of my sanity near death and basically got an intervention with the hospital and psych ward.I hope anyone with depression gets any type of help. And if CBT doesnt work for you thats fine. With my personality I viewed it with contempt and felt like the workbooks were condescending. So if you are similar dont feel too badly. Find different help that works for you. But try it first. ,books,czqg230,1,t5_2qh4i

The problem is that there isnt much interest in doing it right which was the problem with The Hobbit. Instead of dragging a relatively small book out across three long films they could have expanded it with canonical material from the Lord of the Rings appendices. Instead we got a bunch of pointless filler and Hollywood romance.They did a good job with The Lord of the Rings. They made it simple enough for a general audience without debasing it too much and you could see the care and attention put into getting things as right as they could within their confines.

6613072,0,t1_d02xz62,gt How does this dichotemy spectrum? sit with literary fiction vs nonliterary fiction?Its a granular spectrum meaning that its a dichotomy that can switch between its two states from element to element within a piece of art producing a ratio of high vs. low elements within that piece of art. Literary vs. nonliterary fiction is just another of those failed attempts at defining what sets high art apart from low art by looking at what the author came up with rather than how they came up with it. gt What about authors who write stuff with commercial appeal but do it because its their passion? Like a fantasy author for instance.Its a different question. One can provide service as a passion. One can provide expression as a passion. One is low art the other high art regardless. gt What about books that are now considered classics but were at the time written for profit? At best they would fall under the question above this one.Its low art. Low art too can have cultural significance such as by successfully striking the right chord with the people of its time. One example would be Ravels Bolero  not written for profit but certainly not a product of Ravels artistic vision either as he didnt even consider the piece to fully qualify as music to begin with! To him  ostensibly  it was a mere arbitrary exercise without any value or personal expression beyond just that kind of like a TV test card but for orchestras. Likewise TV test cards have also been the subject of similar glorification for their cultural significance. gt Also I imagine very very few books are written with commercialization in mind.I believe you imagine wrongly there.

It gives more focus to talk about one book in depth rather than the more superficial comments youd get from posting a discussion of all of the books in one thread. rbooks gets inundated with what I read last year posts in the new year amp it would be a shame for yours to get caught up among what are mostly just lists.Im not familiar with these ones but someone here will have read them. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is the author of One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich for anyone else who might be interested. Your description of it is rather compelling.I recently read Julian Barnes latest book The Noise of Time which was a fictional biography of a very famous composer living in Soviet Russia.

Carrie Needful Things and Cujo where great books I also enjoyed IT almost all of his short stories are fantastic  I recommend grabbing his collections of shorts  and anything he wrote under Richard Bachman was fantastic.But yes he does have a tenancy to go on and on about a character who has little to do with the plot in many of his novels,books,d0b2f96,1,t5_2qh4i

I mean if you listen to John Adams or Jefferson or Tom Paine all those people wrote impressive and beautifully elegant calls to arms and calls to independence so it makes sense that they would be popular. Reading Mein Kampf it just seems like Hitlers rambling and unhinged.

6718558,0,t3_47jzez,Im a parent from where this all started Fairfax Virginia and so many of these comments miss or mischaracterize whats going on.First Northern Virginia is very racially diverse. I think that whites are barely a majority somewhere between  and  percent. This isnt a bunch of up tight white people banning black books. As you may not have noticed some of the authors are white and some of the parents wanting this are Black Asian Middle Eastern etc.Second Northern Virginia isnt a bunch of Hillbillies. I hardly meet anyone without a postgraduate degree. Ivy grads working at think tanks engineers working for defense contractors lobbyists politicians businessmen working at their companies Washington Office etc.these are the people who live in Northern Virginia. The reason the parents object is because the parents themselves have read these books and they know whats in them. This isnt a case of the ignorant idiot wanting to ban Huckleberry Finn because someone told her Huck says nigger we get these books we buy them we read them we understand and appreciate the artistic merit and valuable social commentary.Third no books are being banned. This is about giving parents the information they need to be good parents. Children in th grade arent old enough to go see the film adaption of The Road without an adult so why should they be able to read it without parental say? Coming from someone whos read Blood Meridian four times Suttree twice The Road twice No Country for Old Men twice and the Orchard Keeper once . . . not every  year old is ready for the gruesome explicit vivid gore that McCarthy often features. And the parents diverse well educated involved caring active parents can make that call better than the teacher.I know a large contingent on rbooks presumably  year old kids see no value in a parent having any control over the reading material of any child.  All I can say is a most of you will change your mind when you have kids of your own and b generally the parents who care about what their kids read are the ones who care about their kids who are active in their lives and education and deference to parents who care about their kids and who are active in their lives and education is wise. ,books,d0e99ol,-3,t5_2qh4i

6743081,0,t3_48114r,Been reading since I was a kid it probably started from the fact that I was exposed to reading by my parents since young my mom would read bedtime stories to me. I guessed that started the spark.   ampnbsp  In primary schoolelementary school it helped that there was a school library full of books. I still remember how I borrowed so many books  was the limit for english books each day and returned them the very next until a point where the librarian questioned me. I sheepishly asked if I could increase the limit somehow it was approved. Yay! I forgot how I proved I had really read the books and yes they were all books meant for below  years old  ampnbsp  After that incident I became known to the few student helpers as The no limit boy Kinda sad for a nickname. Starting since I was   turns out my form teacher the in charge for my class of  was also the teacher in charge of the school library. You could say the small spark found some dry twigs and became a small fire.ampnbspI began to be that one evil guy who was the first to read most of the new books that they bought for the school library. I can still remember being there during lessons and was brought with  others to open the box that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came in.ampnbspSorry I was too engrossed I forgot the question for this thread. Lets skip the part where I read all the wonderful new books.This particular day I belief I was  then I found the gem which was what really made me fall in love with reading. I remember walking in the library and going to the shelf on the second row where the English novels were placed. There was this particular book I saw with an equally interesting cover.ampnbspThis was the book The Curious Incident of the Dog In the Nighttimeby Mark Haddon that turned the little fire into a full blown campfire. Somehow the way that Mark wrote the story of Christopher in the words of an autistic yet genius  year old tugged by my heart and my passion for reading. Probably because Chris was near my age I guess.ampnbspTLDR The Curious Incident of the Dog In the Nighttimeby Mark Haddon is the book that made me fall in love with reading.I do not comment in this sub much but this FAQ made me do it sorry for the long story before the actual question was answered.ampnbspInteresting thing to add  When I was in secondary school high school I met this book again.

It seems like the only thing on that list that requires a full librarian is teaching the specialist classes and even then I dont see why it has to be a librarian depending on the class.Most of the undergrad students I deal with have very poor information skills.  Sure they can use WhatsApp Facebook and Instagram but havent got a clue about proximity searches wildcards Boolean operators citation searching or even phrase searching.  They come in from school with on the whole very poor information literacy skills and have relied on Wikipedia for most of their assignments till that point. They have no idea about how to break a topic or essay question down to generate keywords and then how to go about using them to find information never mind how to evaluate that information.  I also have to deal with academic skills  essay writing critical thinking etc. Any idea how many  year olds know what being critical involves?

6755164,0,t3_487vzs,ooh I love rereading books. I find it really enjoyable.The first time you kind of read things of how the author puts it out and try to understand it from what she has written and wants you to know. And naturally some parts are read faster than others and you gloss over minor details to get to the meat and bones of the story.On a reread because you dont have to focus on the plot so much you can do so many different things. And mainly with all the characters.You can focus on how the early interactions or personalities of characters are before the change especially if it isnt as forward by the author. Or try to view the book through another characters perspective.Take Lord of the Flies for example You can read that whole book and try to view the events of it through the eyes of Jack Simon Ralph Piggy or a Little one and you can experience it just a bit differently emotionally. Even though you know the true characters feelingsintentions or what the other character shouldnt know you can get how that character is viewing the actual events of the book.,books,d0i1gyb,1,t5_2qh4i

DIVIDE AND CONQUER TACTICS ARE USED TO DESTROY EXISTING AFFILIATIONS SIMPLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT MIXED. YOU ARE DECALRING ANYONE A RACIST WHO SIMPLY DISAGREES THAT NOT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE FULLY MIXED IN THE NAME OF FULL EGALITARIANISM. this is the same mind set and rhetoric used by marx and lenin which  down the slippery slope led to the murder of many people in order to achieve full egalitarianism. it is a form of perspectivism. to say that mixes of different skin color that are not fully proportionate to the exact number of people in society is unacceptable is simply to claim that everyone must be represented without regard to their abilities  to their contributions to their demands to their needs. at least communism had a fake lie of an ethosto each according to the need. modern political correctness is an ideology without EVEN AN ETHOS SO MUCH ASTO EACH ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPEN TO EXIST IN SOCIETY. one can argue that up to a certain point in history the disporportionism represented deeper underlying economic stratification a holdover of racism and other bad practices howeverthere comes a point where you can only blame racism for so much and accuse the general broad public of being racist so many times as a cause for the current situations we see. this race baiting is foisted onto the public. women and effeminate white men are most often easily targeted by this ideology of psuedo righteousness which all to often is wrapped up in a pigs blanket with extreme feminism  transexuality  and other total junk nonsense that has even been acklnowedged as such by prominent older feminists and black activists who acknowledge the denigration of core femnism and core acitivities to promote african american inclusiveness. race baiting sexuality baiting and all this OTHER BULLSHIT HAS TAKEN OVER THE NARRATIVE IN ORDER TO BRAINWASH YOUNGER PEOPLE WITH DIVIDE AND CONQUER MINDSET TO CAUSE INFIGHTING WHILE THEY ALL SLOWLY BECOME DESTITUTE AND FULLY BROKE WITH NO ECONOMIC ABILITIES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND NO OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN HOME OR OWN BUSINESS. this why groups like black lives matter funded by divide and conquer oligarch financiers like george soros are banned from russia and are identified as race baiting instituttions by the smalll group of people who are experience and wise enough to identify them for what they are. ,books,d0jm1pl,1,t5_2qh4i

The story had a natural flow to it and sort of trickled out my fingers onto the keys of my laptop. The characters stayed true to how I initially imagined them as well. I came to enjoy Alisons cousin Theron a lot more than I thought I would though!Thank you for the questions!  ,books,d0l2zdr,1,t5_2qh4i

I am a painful reader to please in so much as I am very astute at working out possible plot lines and then marking the most obvious before it gets there. I started on the age of five series before any others. Most of the twists and turns I just did not see coming. The result kept me gripped to the books.    I found my second series the black magician to be less complex but it was written before the age of the five. The story is still far more reaching than most authors come close to achieving.    I am currently working the last of the next in the series line The Traitor Spy. It is an extended series from the Black magician books. I found it very slow going with probably too much explained for people who never read the black magician set. But still I want to finish it.    Trudi is a very clever girl.

Second JK Rowling is a huge activist for women and minorities she doesnt intentionally disrespect cultures.

6859030,0,t1_d0tqgy1,The irony here is in your idea that allowing appropriation is practicing tolerance but somehow lack of appropriation is not a greater show of tolerance in any which way.also we have a disconnect. no one is burning the idea so much as critiquing it. plenty of people in this thread as well as in the original attack on rowling like  people talking about it have offered valid reasons as to why the idea sucks and alternative ideas.          There is a difference between using gore in your cinema to explicit a repulsion in your viewers versus being racist because youre racist. The idea doesnt just offend thats actually besides the point. The ideas perpetuate a stereotype and in this thread its being justified under the guise of art like her racism in itself has a point when it doesnt. She did it because she like many before her didnt know better. Here she has the opportunity to do herself and the community one better but doesnt.          Besides that while I see your point and agree to some extent that quote is a great exaggeration. We have plenty of banned booksstories regardless of what great cultures history we speak of. But people continue to learn the stories and pass them on anyway. Salman Rushdie has almost been burned for his Satanic Verses but the man continues to write as he wishes and we continue to read his works regardless of ethnicity. There are plenty more people cautious to come to the protection of artists than there are the vocal cries to burn them. It only shows in the success of these artists regardless of the disapproval by marginal groups.          tldr a critique is not burning an idea racism for the sake of racism is not art its racism.

So a case can certainly be made against JK Rowlings ability to research and write for other cultures and races.  ampnbspThat being said the books take a special interest in racial and cultural prejudice. They allude to Nazism racial slavery and the civil rights movement again and again. Even less extreme examples like the entire chapter dedicated to the M word are littered through the books. Constantly Rowling focuses on villains as bigots and racist sociopaths. Her entire main message centers on accepting people despite their heritage and also because of it! I havent done any thorough research into this but I believe this is more her losing sight of the trees for the forest than her intentially insulting native americans.  ampnbspThis is the woman who taught a generation of children to respect people no matter what race or gender or sexual orientation they were stand up to bullies and judge people based on their actions and words not elements out of their control. ,books,d0twj0z,2,t5_2qh4i

And often enough they write characters with positive traits they only wish they had. That said it can be really interesting to try and see what things authors take for granted. If youre looking for signs of an authors prejudices keep an eye on descriptive passages and bits about characters that were seemingly supposed to identify with as readers. This isnt by any means foolproof but it can tell you a lot. But no characters with vile prejudices are not axiomatically evidence that the author shares those prejudices. ,books,d0uz8x4,16,t5_2qh4i

6917297,0,t1_d1083k2,Wouldnt they make more money off ebooks since they dont have to spend money on printing book shipping them and sharing profits with retailers?The paper and ink is a small part of the cost of any printed book you buy. If they sold you that much paper and ink it would cost almost nothing. Printing is like  percent of the cost of a printed book. When a paperback doesnt sell they just strip the cover and throw the rest of the book away.When you buy a great printed book most of what you are paying is for the people who made the book so great and the people who made sure you heard about the great book and bought the great book and those people still need to be paid for electronic books. Same writers same editors same copy editors same researchers and fact checkers same marketing department same legal department etc. Maybe no more printer working in a print shop but now you have someone creating and managing the electronic version using a different set of expensive tools. Theres still layout work a cover to design font to select etc. and that all takes professional artists and designers. And an electronic book expected to be cool on all platforms requires that it be tested on all platforms like a piece of software load it look at every page send it back for fixes if things look like shit on a certain supported platform send it back to testing and eventually ship it. Oh and probably you need to do all this in coordination with a print team and an audio team. And all of those people have offices and support staff and electricity bills and retirement plans and so on. You can skimp on some of this stuff but you get what you pay for. A free ebook is a shitty thing copied from various wikipedia pages and shipped as is. Or its a piece of unedited ungrammatical unreadable vanity fiction typed and saved by an author working solo. Good books start with a team of experienced editors who know the difference between good and bad books and who prevent bad books from being published under their name. You go to Simon amp Schuster or HarperCollins or PenguinRandom House or Hachette or wherever because you trust them to save you from paying for absolute shit. ,books,d10ed73,53,t5_2qh4i

In purely literary terms Jordan was a very important writer as a bridge between a traditional epic fantasy style and the more modern genre writing we see today.  He popularized the thirdperson limited POV that has practically become standard in epic fantasy and his worldbuilding is almost as vast and intricate as Tolkien.He is wordy yes.

He tends to write similar characters and similar themes but when he veers off into the plot of each individual book I truly enjoy it.  This one was nice to read because it focused primarily on male characters.  As a chick this is a side of life I dont really experienceerm being a guy I mean and what boys and men go through.Little Women by Louisa May AlcottStill plugging away with L.W.  I know the story pretty well but Id never read the book.  The passages are split up between  people.  Theres no way this was going to be under  pages.  Its nice to finally read the book and see the evolution of each character as they go through lifes passages.With A Good School I read about young boys now Im reading about young girls.And if I can get to it or if I need a break from Little Women I might continue on with Yates and startYoung Hearts Crying by Richard YatesIve been taking it easy with novels under  pages and Id like to push myself to read  pages for the last weeks of this month.  If I could finish both thatd be great!Edit  Important thing I wanted to note in wiki of course it notes that Yates work circulates in post WWII or what also may be known as The Age of Anxiety.  This I thought was interesting since its not technically a literary genre unless Im mistaken.  If The Lost Generation can be one I dont see why The Age of Anxiety cant be one too.

His central need to prevent what happened to his family from happening to any other.So where he goes depends entirely upon his writer. He can take whatever they dish out. I do suspect hes due to lighten the hell up a little.

It wasnt anything special maybe a page about how amazing the book is and then some questions.  Some questions have obvious answers some are more opinion based  and others invite you to get into the characters heads.  If you dont want to read that section  its easy to avoid.  I think some of the Oprahs Book Club editions had notes in the margins where Oprah commented on the book as it unfolded.

7344628,0,t3_4fqlhy,I have found memories of Barnes and Nobles! I think the best suggestion here is more fun events and board games. Perhaps they can go online at well? Each of their stories can be like distribution centers and delivery locations in the immediate vicinity could get cheaper than Amazon. Maybe haha. You would have to ask a distribution economist. I think they should adopt a TeslaNetflix approach to innovating the book world. I think mean noncompeting Amazon in technology that may be too much to overcome. But they can go very far with the right type of social engineering not sure if right term. But they can make the ultimate website to explore new books. Right now I explore new books via rbooks and goodreads and both of those do not nearly serve my needs in exploring new books. Goodreads has a weak recommendation engine. I wanted to build a better one all it takes are some ML libraries and the right goodreads APIs but goodreads doesnt have the right APIs to do that. I have the algorithm in my head and know what tools to use I just need to right data from goodreads to do it. That was a bit of tangent but my point being is that BnN could make the ultimate website to explore new books. Perhaps buy or have a collaboration with goodreads and amp up the site. I have a ton of ideas to improve the site. For example book discussions based on chapter these will create timeless book clubs where people can always discuss a particular chapter as they are reading the book without getting spoiled to whats going to happen.  They can also create the ultimate kids section website. They could consult with or team up with LeVar Burton of reading rainbow in developing an amazing online experience for kids regarding books. Heck just hire LeVar Burton. That guy in an incredible innovator. We may take reading rainbow for granted but imagine coming up with the concept of reading rainbow when there was no reading rainbow which is a very entertaining and overall well done show. LeVar Burton is a genius and an artist. They can also team up with other kids authors to create awesome online experience versions of their book. Like what JK rowling did with pottermore. They can also get into the EbookAudiobook business pretty easily be hiring Overdrive or OneclickDigital. Both of them have developed amazing services for libraries so they could also efficiently develop a platform for BnN too. Maybe it could compete with Audible. With all these great online services they can advertise events at their local barnes and noble events. On the kids website they would see advertisements for a kids event in their local BnN. On either the audiobook app or the goodreads website theyll see notification for a book discussion event for a book that they read recently. Or an meet up for fans of a particular Author. Or a workshop in creating podcasts and audiobooks. Or a workshop on becoming an author. Workshop on being an audiobook narrator. An meet and greet for a favorite local author.Barnes and Noble could also take a note from Netflix and also become a publishing company too publishing new Authors and promoting their works in their stores. Perhaps board games too. They would have the strongest platform to promote their authors their store and hypothetical websites. Another interesting idea an audiobook production studio at BnN. So in a nutshell embrace technology. They dont need the best technology like Amazon they can do a ton with regular technology. Heres a hypothetical situation even if the stores are a loss the stores would still be worth it because of them being strong advertisers for other strong profit platforms. If BnN can get a foot in each type of major book platform ratings recommendations discussions audiobooks Ebooks publishing supplemental book online experiences aka pottemore bookrelated entertainment aka Reading Rainbow aka Oprah book club aka a book magazine blook blogging live book events they can use these platforms to boost each other. Imagine a rbooks with  million very active subscribers. Imagine just having one account putting all the books youve read or would like to read then receiving notifications for very relevant things to you on other platforms. With a medium with a big user base it would be easy to create events even very niche ones. Or people can make their own. They can also make platforms we never even heard of. ,books,d2d17s1,2,t5_2qh4i

Youd have to ask them but my guess is the authors appreciate that it makes the book accessible to a larger audience.

When I went to India as a kid the only libraries we ever saw were on college campuses and the selection of books that werent textbooks was very meager. I highly doubt any of them had an Overdrive selection. Finding books to read was extremely frustrating. Its not like all of my family lived in tiny villages but reasonably large towns still didnt have much in the way of bookstores at the time. You could buy secondhand books from vendors along the street or from the bookstall at the train station actually one of the best places or from bookstores if you could find one that had something other than textbooks. I used to get excited when we visited cousins in big cities because that was the only place I could go to Higginbothams and actually find a decent selection of English books.And I can certainly understand the desire to be able to read privately without announcing your book selections to the world. I dont live there so I dont know what Amazons selection of digital books looks like. Are all the same English books available? What does the selection of Hindi Bengali Tamil Telugu Punjabi Malayalam Gujarati Marati Kannada etc. books look like?

A gimmick to get grandmothers to buy the book for their grandchildren more than any comment on the writing content. I guess this is another ploy to make books more appealing rather than have any factual impact on the books contents.As one example one of my favourite books is Retribution falls and I found out its considered YA.

There is usually a link somewhere in the sidebar of the sub to message the mods of that sub. Also be aware that breaking reddits spam and selfpromotion rules may get your account banned.

A lot of the rest of it becomes clear you kinda need to trust it and roll with it. The Bene Gesserits role becomes clearer as you go as do Mentats etc. It is the very opposite of explicit and that does put a lot of people off but you can generally just infer the kind of thing a Mentat is from the things theyre doing. Do you need to know what a Mentat is? It will become clear by the end of the book  in fact its very important that you know by the end. But you will get a lot more info on it before you get there.Same for Ornithopter.

7547608,0,t1_d3040mh,The three part book collectively known as the Divine Comedy was called a comedy because it was written in Italian not Latin. At the time all serious works were done in latin so this was seen as a mark against the quality of work. Also very few people want to try and force their way through PL with a dictionary and possibly a reading guide.  Im trying to get easily accessible copies into peoples hands so that they are engaged. Also you have a very liberal definiton of contemporary English works. I think most people would consider a Classical work.,books,d304kf0,1,t5_2qh4i

Sometimes the quality is not up to par they translate names to crige inducing stuff. You have to wait a ton of time. Also if it doesnt sell too well or even the publisher goes bankrupt they just dont translate the whole series.

Are they gorgeous Shakespearean prose that deserve reverence and literary respect? Absolutely not. But Im hoping to tap into a truth here. In each poem theres a little pain point something Ive had to deal with thats made me frustrated sad confused or lonely. If someone reads a poem a joke really of mine and it makes them smile and feel a little less isolated then Ive done my job.

They are primary because theyre essential to the plot convey a large portion of the important parts of the story and their death has a major impact on the reader.Unless you start defining primary characters in a way that just retroactively dismisses characters that are clearly primary characters Joffrey Ned Stark being the biggest as secondary you cant really argue this.,books,d394mb9,2,t5_2qh4i

7749765,0,t1_d3n2j6y,For me it was the skill of the voice actor who did the narrating for me. She really blew me away on so many levels.First of all Im an independent author with pretty much zero budget to speak of so the only thing I was offering to a prospective voice actor was half the profits of an audiobook from a no name author that might never sell a single copy.Second of all the novella is an experimental work in which I didnt use any quotation marks to set off dialogue and I didnt use any names to refer to any of the characters just the pronouns her she etc. or their job. So it was difficult to read and probably much more so to act.Needless to say I did not get very many auditions only one in fact if Im being totally honest and after a few weeks I decided it was time to just get started and go with Julie. When she sent me the final copy of her work though I was really blown away. She did a new voice for each character and there were a good number of them and she interpreted who was talking when pretty much perfectly and it sounded better than I ever could have imagined it would have.So Julie Hoversons amazing performance was definitely the most surprising aspect of this process for me. It made me feel like I had done a pretty good job in my writing if she could interpret something so difficult so perfectly and she deserves to be heard more than anything else.,books,d3n3a92,11,t5_2qh4i
7750216,0,t1_d3n3l0i,The biggest obstacle for me I would have to say is money. Editors cover artists and advertising are all very expensive and I have very little to no extra spending money lying around to use on them. So I admit that my works could use some professional editing sorry for the typos yall I tried to catch them all that my cover designs could probably be more attractive and that I definitely dont do enough advertising though Im trying today lol but thats all because I do all those aspects of every project on my own at the same time that Im writing new stories and Im only one person. Give me a break.  So thats definitely my biggest obstacle.And no my choice to self publish isnt really connected to my political beliefs. Id love to have professional publishers do all that work I mentioned above for me besides the writing of course but no traditional publishing houses want me yet. I think the works that I have self published are a little too experimental for publishing houses to gamble on when Im a no name author so Im working on some more popular fiction in the hopes of finally snagging a traditional publishing deal.

Once I stepped back from it and examined the way I interacted with people I realized that I wasnt practicing the basics that I knew would help me. The title is cheesy and some of the examples are as well but if you look past that to the basic lessons within I find it to be extremely enlightening.     It forces you to hold a mirror to yourself and keep you accountable to yourself. I find it good practice to reread this or similar books every year as a gutcheck. Are you still being a good friend?

GGK never makes the mistake of sacrificing story for realism. The book has so many people acting irrationally and contradictory and so many unbelievable coincidences that another author may have looked at it and been like no that would never happen. But this fails on two levels. First we impose a narrative structure on history so when narrative tries to imitate history it resonates more deeply when the narrative is rewarded. Second history is full of things that would be called unrealistic in other books.GGK is a true talent. His books are historical without being impersonal epic without being exhausting and beautiful without being flowery.Id love to see him tackle something closer to home like the enlightenment or colonialism. I loved the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson but I sometimes feel like he was too constrained by reality and replacing his meticulousness with GGKs poetry would be really exciting.,books,d3rckx1,2,t5_2qh4i

7809279,0,t1_d3t72yd,As a word of caution though Im not sure youll get the same thing out of Catcher simply because I dont. For me Gatsby is more like a classic tragedy. Through Nick we witness these great forces love jealousy the American Spirit play on wellwritten but actually fairly simple personalities. The ending is sort of inevitable because the characters come from irreparably different world the modest Midwest the affluent East. Its language is poetic and stylized the characters are like embodiments of themes. Its beautiful in a vast and sweeping sort of way. Catcher is more about psychology. Its very personal you feel almost enmeshed or trapped with Holden and how you recognize yourself in him affects your opinion of him. Hes a brilliant character because he is like a real person complex. The book is partly amazing because of how close you are to him. Both Fitzgerald and Salinger are two of my favourite writers though I havent read as much Fitzgerald. Catcher is actually the least enjoyable of Salingers for me  his Glass stories are better in my opinion. If you want some amazing Salinger characterization with some of that Fitzgerald magic try Raise High the Roofbeams Carpenters!. Edit corrected autocorrect.,books,d3ttrry,1,t5_2qh4i

Hopefully Ill find some books among the billions of recommendations Im now sitting on from this thread that come close to the genius of the hitchhikers series but somehow I doubt anything else will match it. There were so many moments reading through it where I had to put the book down because I was laughing so hard or send a stupidly genius quote to someone or just kinda sit back and say woah. Really was not prepared for how much I would love this and Im sad that Adams left us before he got to finish it.

7891467,1,t1_d430ge5,Yes! Have my upvote and my support comrade! Snow Crash was some serious garbage. I mean Hiro Protagonist? Really? I get hes trying to be funny or whatever but that sort of cheesy overly blunt humor persists throughout the novel even though it gets old after the first chapter. None of the characters ever develop in any way I care about and their dialogue in some places is almost too painful to read.In the interest of fairness though I gotta say the world is super cool with all the different neighborhoods and factions and whatnot.

7899595,0,t1_d43ttr9,Uh I would describe their critiques as just that  critiques  rather than getting offended but I also completely disagree with the notion that one can just hand wave away problematic aspects of a book by basically saying well its just SF dont think too much about it! If you want to create art you need to be prepared for critiques. More importantly these critiques have followed Stephenson for most of his career I just think Seveneves got a lot more attention because  it received rather mixed reviews in other words its not some beloved work where diehard fans will flip out if you critique it  society as a whole has become far more familiar with various theoretical approaches to gender race class etc. whereas before it was largely the domain of academics and  it might offer the most egregious example yet of Stephensons essentialist tendencies.As the article touches on even before the genetic drift occurs in Seveneves the titular Eves are reduced to racial and cultural stereotypes gender essentialism is perhaps most obvious in Cryptonomicon but you see bits of it in his other works Greta Niu explores what she calls technoOrientalism in The Diamond Age I also think this GoodReads review does a solid job touching on some of the awkward aspects of TDA for something more substantial about the contradictions in Stephensons work you can read this or thisUltimately I think Stephensons a pretty good author and is definitely an intelligent guy but I also think he has an unfortunate tendency to slip into this odd sort of technolibertarianengineer way of viewing the world thats only gotten worse as time has gone on e.g. his increasing penchant for taking potshots at academics and the like. Others have already said so elsewhere in the thread but it feels like Stephensons earlier works were more genuinely subversive on these topics whereas his more recent books seems to almost embrace this weird video gamelike conception of humans.,books,d43zlff,1,t5_2qh4i

7905106,1,t1_d44kii6,This discussion somewhat goes to the debatedivide about how people write. There are those who do no planning whatsoever  they call themselves pantsers i.e. they fly by the seat of their pants when they write. They start I guess randomly with an idea and write and write and write until they get somewhere and stop and then try to edit their way out of the mass of words often in the hundreds of thousands into a coherent story.The other method and the recommended one if you read any guides of how to write by people who know what they are doing is to plan the story. A story is a structured thing  it has a beginning and a middle and an end. There is the arc of the story that has rules about what is supposed to happen when within the broader structure  these are all rules you can and should learn about how to structure a story so that it delivers the goods so to speak. It is generally the pantsers who are the ones who come out with statements about their characters doing unexpected things and how that has derailed their story. It is far less seldom that the characters are attributed with doing something positive  which is why I think it is a method of blame shifting. I cant take the blame for not planning because I vehemently oppose that method of writing but someone has to be at fault so lets blame the characters. The reality of the dead ends not planning inevitably create conflicts with their belief that you dont have to plan a novel so to resolve the conflict they blame their characters. ,books,d44ly70,-1,t5_2qh4i

There may be issues in printing for example and quality control that they might not be able to oversee.

But instead we just get delays and we are watching season  still  books short.I am not sure they signed for this. They now have to finish the story themselves because GRRM left them high and dry and now they are sure kind of lost at sea struggling to bring the material in some sort of respectful conclusion without any actual new books to adapt from.

8019053,0,t1_d4h0nal,I dont think thats the case. People are contesting what seems to be a complete flip in the writing to reduce our characters popular for their gray morals to cutout designated good and evil characters.Furthermore where GRRM writing the books was very careful to show politics and there being different kinds and forms of power wielded by different kinds of characters the show seems to be reducing everyone to the same modus operandi morals and motivations to the point where the characters are no longer recognizable as the people they were initially. And not in a way that suggests theyve grown or that the changes are directly linkable to events that theyve been involved in.This episode particularly characterizes Sansa and Dany as shadows of the people they once were. Now that Tyrion is perhaps the last standing Designated Smart Guy everyone elses plots and motivations are perhaps being simplified to let him take some spotlight?

He got them to make peace and everyone agreed to it save a few jackasses that he managed to hang after his resurrection. Not to mention he was good enough that Mormont groomed him as a future Commander good enough that the Watch elected him as a teenager.Oh and did we mention when he led them to victory at the Battle of Hardhome against the wildlings when they battled at the wall despite long odds?Jon is inspiring enough to be led into battle noble enough to do what is right and perhaps most importantly charismatic enough to create alliances and keep peace.

At some point we saw him switch to whilst and nuncle then really double down on the words are wind and japes and nipples on a breastplate.  Does he go back and add more redundant text so its consistent or does a dutiful editor fix it and delete some things?Theres also the major retcon.  Tyrion now needs a backstory to his tumbling and gymnastic endeavors.  Pretty ridiculous however the flow of GoT is different from the other books anyway.

Its a science fiction story about a former spaceship pilot who developes spacephobia and has to remain on Earth so he gets a job piloting a microsubmarine used to  shepherd whales that are used to feed an almost overpopulated Earth. In the book whales become the cows of the st century and are bred fed and butchered.

8062940,0,t1_d4m191p,I have to agree with this. After studying American Literature for the past year I find it almost impossible to get an accurate portrayal of American History using only three novels. Rowlandson is an excellent example of captive narratives not to mention a vast majority of American Literature as the country was forming was not in novel form at all. Much of it was sermons and historical biographical accounts.Thomas Jeffersons political work or perhaps the Madison couples a vast amount of slave literature my particular vote goes for Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl I will argue up and down for Hawthornes Scarlet Letter despite a great deal of people hating it Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.

The sword case did NOT actually bend like that. Granted yes this shouldve been caught in postproduction and CGI corrected but this sort of thing happens all the time when you film a show in the analog domain and transfer it to a digital workstation in postproduction. I see it all the time in projects I oversee. They typically do use nonmetallic standins for real weapons when mounting a horse because of safety and because horses are very skittish creatures. But they never bend like this. Again it was caused by the camera shutter speed andor the telecine. But mistakes do happen. One of the LotR movies they had a car in the background during a field scene. It was edited out in time for the retail DVD version. But it can still be seen on the theatrical film negatives and DVD screener. Even high budget productions to err is human. But there was no error in this particular instance.

Right now they are affecting the next generation in small bit irrevocable ways less time at home fewer sitdown dinners no time to read a book. In a lot of cases we could probably blame the parents and be partially correct. But its also a factor of living in a society where its become more and more acceptable to carry on the expenditures and responsibilities of a full adult life while barely being able to make ends meet. The people I see in this thread who grew up poor but still had access to books were the lucky ones.

Tone is hard to translate because tone is often conveyed subtly by the connotations of individual words and the same goes for humor.

8186197,0,t3_4re1li,It may be because youre used to reading books with long verbose writing styles. Brandon Sanderson David Eddings Phillip Pullman for example write with long flowing styles and their plots move slowly. Asimov alternately in Foundation uses a very condensed yet colorful style. He writes in  words what Sanderson would write in . Because of this scenes move incredibly fast. Sometimes Asimov litterally says THIS HAPPENED and then moves straight into the dialogue scene he wants you to pay attention to. This makes reading foundation a slow task. They seem like small books but they are so dense with information you need to spend time paying attention to each word to get the most out of each scene.I felt just like you at first. I had to make myself slow down and enjoy the language. Now I love his writing style. The Mule is the best short story of the lot. Han Pritcher is my hero.

I believe I once read in an interview that Ken Follet was inspired by it to write his own books. It too builds a compelling story around a craftsman building a church. Its an old book though you might be lucky enough to find a used copy in a local bookstore but you will most likely have to eBay it if youre interested. I think its been few decades since theyve reprinted it.  ,books,d58wa36,2,t5_2qh4i

I dont do it often I like to finish what I start but for Anita Blake and a few other series I made an exception. The storyline became ridiculous and the writing went down hill fast. I probably hateread a couple in the hopes that the series would get better but I gave up when I realized that my love for the early version of Anita Blake was no longer enough for me to overcome the terrible books later on in the series. ,books,d594gs8,2,t5_2qh4i

In many ways I grew up with La recherche the teenage years and young adulthood in the first book back when I was  then first love in A lombre des jeunes filles en fleurs In the Shadow of the Young Girls in Flower at  pretty much like the narrators first encounter with Albertine then the encounter with the arts the mundane society etc. As such its one of my most personal books Ive yet to read Le temps retrouv the last one and I believe you need to read it as a quest as a genuine attempt from an individual to understand the world and society in which he lives. I love Prousts style and would value it above everybody elses if not Woolfs writing in To the Lighthouse. There is something profoundly melancholic about it and very cruel. For one what strikes me most is his ability to express the littlest impressions we have all experienced once but never quite noticed. Even the first page of La recherche is full of those tiny precious jewels I had never given a thought that is to say learnt to appreciate the way I would wake up at night completely disoriented thinking that Im in the middle of a boat or floating in a virtually infinite mattress. Proust tells you about this feeling. Likewise I never quite paid attention to the way I would wake up in the midst of the night thinking I had slept well only to find out that it was barely past two oclock in the morning. Proust tells you this. This may sound stupid to you but I firmly believe that this is one of the goals of literature to enchant the everyday life to give it meaning. Everything is meaningful in Prousts writing a car ride back home where he is moved to tears by the geometry and perspective of two church bells this so weird and touching idea that his girl Albertine has a tiny mole that he can never locate and that seems to change position on her face every time he sees her which in turns dwells on the deformities of our memory and perception... Anyway this is only one of the many reasons I very much enjoy this book. I actually find the many mundane moments very funny and Proust definitely has a knack for telling stories and anecdotes in a ironic way. And of course the love affair with Albertine the idea that everything we do all our attempt to communicate and convey our feelings to another and furthermore everything we get from other people is based on misunderstanding mistakes desire lust and quiproquos. Or as Conrad put it We live as we dream alone.,books,d5jrxyc,3,t5_2qh4i

8343079,0,t3_4tr61y,I felt very similar to you for many reasons that people have already mentioned.

I get that its for the reader so they can say his name right in real life but its like he didnt realize Kvothe was saying that out loud.

8343332,0,t1_d5kdxij,Well the best advice I can give you about being downvoted is to not talk about it. Youll always get a few extra downs double entendre intended hitting you because they dont like whiners. Also some people just downvote for no good reason. Because they they already know the answer to a question they think its beneath them stuff like that. They think theyre teaching you a lesson about how to behave or grow up or something like that. Just dont care. If your question gets answered thats all thats important.And finally dont forget that upvotes and downvotes are a necessary part of the system. Offtopic comments kind of deserve to be put in their place if you will. But I feel that questions never hurt.

8374591,0,t1_d5o08c4,The idea that humans are inherently savage is a product of colonialist bullshit. Golding positions savagery as equivalent to tribal society and that idea has just never been used to justify horid abuse or borderline genocide of native peoples or anything. That entire thing can just fuck the hell off. Then of course you can take Goldings central conflict and actually let the idea play out. If the nature of humanity is inherently evil and brutish Ralphs desire for a democratic society is impossible. The individual selfish nature would lead to conflict with no greatest good achievable. Contrary to the moral Jack had the right of it authoritarian power is the only way order only achievable through force violence and the threat of death. Not coincidentally the idea that civilization and society is fragile and easily destroyed is a common idea pushed by the authoritarian right. The narrative is always We are under attack they seek to destroy us. we must fight. Anyone who opposes this is aiding them they are traitors and must be destroyed too. Thats the fear they prey on not the superstitious fear of the unknown. Not only does Golding completely fail on that point but he actually furthers the idea of civilization as an easy victim of the savage other. That would be an issue on the best of time. But when a everyones favorite cheeto dust coated fascist is running to become US president entirely on that narrative of fear...well then the flaws in that idea become super important. But please Id love to hear how you think conflation of tribal society with senseless ritualistic murder is a spot on idea or whatever the hell rebuttal you can come up with. ,books,d5odgre,0,t5_2qh4i

8385325,0,t3_4ufe0x,Germany and thinking about this Im seriously shocked at how vastly this varies in our country.I cant speak for other German states but in mine the curriculum is very dependent on the teacher  whatever they pick you read.I switched schools a lot and apparently all of my teachers were into mostly newer stuff which leaves me with a lot of holes to be filled  Ive somehow managed to get through high school without reading Goethe Schiller Kafka Brecht or Thomas Mann  not good.In our system you can pick subjects to focus on after th grade meaning from age  you have  major subjects  if you pick German here youre likely to get a good overview  but if you dont its smooth sailing with a bunch of poems and contemporary books. This also depends on the state as in most but not mine German as a major subject is mandatory.This is a severe flaw in system design if you ask me because given the choice most students will opt out. For example I remember we got to suggest books to read in German class in th grade  the final two contestants were Goethes Faust I and Angels amp Demons by Dan Brown. I was the only one who voted for Faust so I ended up reading Angels amp Demons for a second time...That said here are some of the books I can remember The diary of Anne Frank The Judge and His Hangman by Friedrich Drrenmatt Nathan the wise by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing All quiet on the Western front by Erich Maria Remarque Friedrich by Hans Peter Richter Jacob the liar by Jurek Becker ,books,d5pppmd,3,t5_2qh4i

8458216,0,t1_d5yoco6,That is a fallacy of an argument.Just because something has been that way for X years does not make it ok. If you go back and look on the opinion that the SC gave on social security  you can see how out of date their arguments are. but the most telling is their reasoning on why such a program cant be on a state or local level as amendment  says it should beA system of old age pensions has special dangers of its own if put in force in one state and rejected in another. The existence of such a system is a bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose. Only a power that is national can serve the interests of all.In other words we cant obey amendment  because if we did some people might choose to move to states where they would have more economic freedom while others might choose to move to states where they can be lazy.But the whole point of amendment  was so that states could be different and legislation could be seen as good or bad by comparing the results of the  now  states.

I dont really know how pop culture references make something neckbeardy though.Still Id recommend at least trying the rd book as thats where the writing starts to improve drastically from the first two and also marks the beginning of some ongoing plot arcs.  You could skip the second in favor of reading a wikipedia summary as thats the worst one in the series and is probably the least important one in the series other than the introduction of a couple of characters.,books,d61l81f,1,t5_2qh4i

Honestly just think about all the damage a bulldozer would take if it ran you over I mean it would be none at all but its a thought worth looking into.Also I recommend my favorite passage from the series. It is by far the one that gets the largest laugh out of me and I crack up even writing it this it goes like this Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad and now here he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. The entire context of this situation coupled with the image it places in my head it just makes me giggle. The second passage is the one where ford becomes one with the universe and animals then snaps the deers neck  After a while an animal a deer perhaps  would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it his eyes would soften and shine and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love a love which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would decend on the surrounding countryside peacefull and serene eminating from this transfigured man. Slowly the dear would approch step by step until it was almost nuzzling him whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck.,books,d63x852,3,t5_2qh4i

8572293,0,t1_d6csueb,I taught this book for years!The hardest thing to convey to students is the effect of propaganda I realized. They dont believe it works. They dont feel inspired by current military advertising. So I did this I showed some rather creative military stuff  Doors Down did a music video for the National Guard and a few other good commercials. They discuss how this doesnt sway them at all. Then I do a random survey showing some pictures from a dove ad unlabeled theyre just rating people and I collect those results. The next lesson I reveal the results scattering in things like average weight and size of Americans.  Even average weight and size for people in th grade I collected that too anonymously. I shared some psychology articles that I cant recall the names of.. one was on body image. The other was on how technology changes are partly due to people feeling like they need the newest thing to be relevant so like when the iPhone changes color or size you feel compelled to get the new one.We always finish with looking at photoshop pics and the real thing. How the look is unachievable. And I taught them to dissect the ads the different parts where your eyes are drawn first whats actually being highlighted the got milk ads were hilarious to look at when you do this because milk is never the first thing you see.When we get back to the adds we rated I had the info of the weight of the class the weight of Americans the age you start getting wrinkles the age you start getting gray hair...After just one day of really looking at this they realized they were swayed by advertising afterall but in a different way than they expected. A lot of them male and female would share how they felt pressure to be bigger or smaller or wear certain things. And it was all because of these ads.  They were shocked and miffed and sad. Ads for makeup making them feel like they needed not only the make up but the skin and the color hair.... but half the stuff they thought they needed wasnt real or achieveable. Guys talked about muscles and how it looked so effortless but how hard it was to really look like that. The football boys were great talking about the body of real athletes vs the photoshopped ones.Suddenly they saw Animal Farm in new eyes and they felt angry with the messages like two legs bad four legs good turning into four legs good two legs better because they recognized similarity with new tech gadgets and such. Always they clung to the slogan All Animals are equal but some are more equal than others. Its hard for students to approach a book like this. I did a ton of history lessons to really show how this went down and connecting characters to historical figures. When they talked to kids in other classes they always would report they didnt like this book or understand it like they did. It was like they read two different books. Kids dont really get the complexity unless you show them how it parallels in their world. But once they see it they start looking at more real aspects like the political ads and real news stories. Teaching that was like opening Pandoras box for them. ,books,d6d49zt,838,t5_2qh4i

It was a derogatory term now its just descriptive.The correct term for todays religions is neopagan and it only considers to make it short and quickly understandable polytheists. Yes there are also neopagans who define themselves atheists but here we should define what a god is and the discussion would be endless. Zoroastrianism is not neopagan. New polytheistic religions. So we have revivalists who cannot follow the exact old religions both for lack of ancient sources and for some ethical reasons in many cases  could you imagine a hippy such a neopagan sacrifice an ox for Zeus? Poor oxen! And then where the heck do you find a completely white pure ox? How much will it cost? How do you kill it alone?

Its actually quite odd how people immediately think of Amazon when they think of online book buying when BampN does all the same things and has been for a while.  There are other large online booksellers in the mix as well.  Better World Books is a personal favorite.Second I dont know what you mean by obscure and independent stuff but the beauty of a bookstore including BampN is the ability to physically browse and discover and be inspired by new things.  I always find something unexpected and interesting at a bookstore including the obscure up to date small press stuff etc.  BampNs curation is perhaps not always as interesting as the neighborhood indie shop my preference but there is plenty to discover at either.Amazon is a website.  It doesnt have shelves.  You order online to get something specific without the inconvenience of getting dressed and going to the store.

This is not contradictory to OPs article is it? According to it reading out loud is a different process to reading silently the syllables are formed with the mouth before they are understood. It doesnt say it had to be so loudly that others could understand it. We know this process from people who learn to read First reading out loud then muttering then just moving the lips without air being exhaled. Any reason this couldnt have happened on a larger scale?Edit Shame that the Gavrilov article is behind a paywall.

8658556,0,t3_4yg3vm,Someone at my work who knew I was a fantasy fan recommended Eragon to me and pitched it as a light YA fantasy book. I figured why not and read it over the course of a few days. As I read it I enjoyed it enough but wouldnt use anything stronger than okay to describe it. But when I finished the book it dawned on me that I just read almost plot point to plot point A New Hope just set in a middleearth like setting. Now I understand the Heros Journey isnt anything new and Star Wars wasnt the most original thing either but the similarities were just insane. Fast forward a while later and I gave Eldest a shot. While it didnt follow Empire Strikes Back as closely it still covered all the main points wrapped up in a really boring book with an insufferable protagonist. Eragon goes from sounding like a mature level headed individual to a bratty kid in a span of a couple pages a whole lot in that book. In the end I felt compelled to finish what I started so I checked the third book out from the library. But then it starts with the main characters planning a rescue mission and I just couldnt do it. I returned it an hour later.Anyway thats my two cents on the series. As for series Ive been captivated enough to do rereads Harry Potter A Song of Ice and Fire Kingkiller Chronicle The Dark Tower.

The story has a lot of details which are intimate and could be the mother recalling her life but theyre also exaggerated and could be the son imaging them.The mother killing herself would be the culmination of all the heavy psychic shit getting cut out before it burst forth and was directed at the son. So the story could be him after the fact trying to see it as a present just further illustrating how active his imagination is when grievinghe imagines this life for his mother a reasoning and twists it into a well meaning gift.The son killing himself would fall in line with him talking about his desire to pay back all the love she gave him given him being a problem child. That he son expressed it all for her not trying to communicate with her but it simply being the way it came about organically.I personally dont think suicide is an expression but as you should know its fiction. And fiction can explore what is and isnt the case. Cause its fiction.

8735699,0,t3_4znmwc,From what Ive gathered there seems to be several reasons and a few of them stem back to McCarthys writing style.People seem to have a real problem with his disdain for punctuation and while I get the frustration theres a reason why people like Joyce and Faulkner are considered some of the gods of prose and they were not the biggest fans of punctuation either. I think you can put Mr. McCarthy in this camp. As a writer myself the mans writing is so insanely rich and beautiful that it can feel overwhelming. In The Road there were parts that were so  sprawling that it was hard to take in the scenery but maybe that was the point.Second people dont like his plots. But books like The Road or Blood Meridian are just tales of people pushing through life. There are destinations but not the standard plotlines and people just dont like that. They want to be entertained but Im pretty sure McCarthy isnt interested in that.The Road is very much a hyperbole of the human experience. The absurd violence and surreal surrounded by endless death. Thats not everyones cup of tea. Combine that with a lack of grammatical fences and standard  entertaining plotlines  devices youll find people annoyed or enthralled.But this is typical for books that step out of ordinary frameworks. I.E. Infinite Jest Ulysses Gravitys Rainbow etc. The book is beautiful though. One of the most heartwrenching but graceful endings Ive ever read. I think I want to read it again now hahaha. ,books,d6xlz5q,11,t5_2qh4i

Afterwards wed donate the left over books usually to the childrens literacy charity.  The issues mainly arose with the left over books. While we had set aside some classics and childrens books for the charity much of what didnt sell wasnt appropriate for that group and others didnt want them.

I was also working hr shifts at that time and was getting a  minute break if I was lucky. He also had this list of things we can and cannot do behind the bar. We werent allowed read books cause it said nobody likes a smart ass with their nose buried in a book. We were allowed to glance at the newspaper. One day I was doing a crossword. He grabs it off of me walks away with it and tries to do it. When he couldnt get one he put it into the bin and poured his drink over it so I couldnt do it.

8927206,0,t1_d7kw1x7,True but the problem with it is that people will choose to celebrate a culture but ignore the hardships of those sufferings with in it. Like I have no problem with white people getting cornrows but at the end of the day it becomes disrespectful when you take certain aspects of a culture but ignore the reality of those who created it. And in America especially there is a historical context for cultural appropriation being pretty fuckedup evil. Like for instance rock and roll the entire genre was created by black people. But white people had the money and power to make money off of it... so they just stole it while at the same time treating black people like they were absolutely worthless subhuman trash.  so like most everything with black and white America this issue is more complicated then black people just being mad at white people having a hair cut there is a historical context to the anger.  And it just comes down to one fact white people throughout history have stolen the fruits of black culture all throughout American history and afterwords took the credit for themselves. That and cause only perpetuating A Narrative of black inferiority. Shit it still goes on today with the way people talk about violence with black while deliberately ignoring the historical significance of it. And that it was created by racist white people on purpose.,books,d7kx30j,3,t5_2qh4i

8963737,0,t3_515b2p,The book was definitely engaging as like Nate I wanted to uncover the mysteries but I cant help feeling a bit let down. People have said that The Fold explains some notably the suicides but I dont really want to read another book to answer this one. Some of the characters were definitely flat and the story descended into a cheesy action film style plot with the stereotypically easy escape from an almost omnipotent Cthulhubeing. There was so much potential the dynamic of the group especially Veek was set up so well and the sense of mystery was ominous at the start but I think it definitely got a bit out of hand. Maybe I was just expecting a more Shutter Islandeque twist or something more horror or something more like The Firm. Nonetheless my first reddit book club and a very casual and lightheartedly enjoyable read I just wish I knew that it was going to be like that before I began!

Like  udarkwingduck said there are people who make entire careers out of being this way and exploiting the feelings of others who do. Ann Coulter Rush Limbaugh Bill OReilly and Sean Hannity are all good examples of individuals who argue using almost nothing but strawman arguments. They either dont understand the other side or pretend not to in favor of strawmen. Take reddit for example.

Mersault accepts his larger role that of an object lesson in the reason we surrender absolute freedom for the convenience and courtesy of civilization.  His reasoning was his own he takes responsibility for his action and his only hope is that the order which he abandoned or abandoned him is strengthened through the shared contempt of someone who broke the rules for no ennobling reason.

Yes it is about the s supposedly but seeing as how it was written down hundreds of years later we have to be cautious about accepting it as fact just as we would with the bible or any account that has gone through a game of telephone.We DONT have a pretty decent account of Mycenae. Every piece of evidence you point to multiple kings fighting constantly and a strong mercenary tradition. Not that unlike the early classical. is previous scholars including classical Greek scholars projecting their reality onto assumed ancestors. This is also a problem we see in the bible as well as renaissance and medieval paintings of the biblical era you project your reality onto an uncertain past. Mycenaean Cyclopean architecture does make us think that the Mycenaeans were afraid of SOMETHING ill agree with that. But whether it was external internal or other local forces is impossible to tell. Also we dont actually KNOW they were kings though Linear B does hint to that Ill agree. The point Im trying to make is that the Mycenaean world is still largely unknown at best misunderstood at worst. We draw our popular understanding of it from ancient sources which projected their own reality onto the past. We must be cautious before we state anything is certainty. ,books,d7zg9xn,1,t5_2qh4i

Tolkien can be read in many ways. One view is that the story of Men taking over and Elves leaving parallels colonization stories.  In this reading Tolkien is far from the reactionary that Moorcock proposes. As for Tolkiens prose style to each his own. There is a tendency to criticize fantasy as not literature but an interesting question is to ask What is the first work that does not count as fantasy?Gilgamesh The Iliad The Aeneid Beowulf all are archetypes of fantasy.

The first two books especially were garbage compared to later on as the series grew the jokes became more subtle and sophisticated characters became more complex and interesting especially Death and Vimes and overall the stories became more brilliant and creative than just a parody of fantasy.Which is why whenever I recommend the books I tell people to start at Guards Guards.

Also it is presumptuous of you to assume that enlightenment cant be entertaining. I definitely didnt say that literature had to be boring.  Just that entertainment doesnt always equate literary.  We study Vonnegut and Pynchon because of what the text says about the human experience now and while I find Vonnegut entertaining as well I didnt enjoy reading Pynchon.  I enjoyed The Awakening and loathed Ben Franklins Autobiography.

9162488,0,t3_55r6lq,I didnt read a single book until I quit high school at the end of the th grade. The first book I read was The Catcher in the Rye. I decided to read one of the books they tried to get me to read in school and I picked Catcher because it was short and seemed easy to read. Still it took me more than a month to get to the end of it. At the time I left school I was failing so bad that I was two years behind in English so I read painfully slow.I ended up liking the book so I read another one from the list The Old Man and the Sea. Again it was short and seemed like something I could conquer. I ended up liking it too.That set me off reading a whole string of books. I started getting faster at reading. I eventually abandoned the high school reading list and got into a Stephen King phase. I remeber being really impressed with myself when I finished the novel IT all  pages of...it.Ive gone on to read books about physics and evolution and history and politics and biographies and all manner of things in between.I was functionally illiterate when I left high school but deciding to read that first book was the best thing I ever did. It changed everything. I like to tell people I got my education from Barns amp Noble University.I was a poor and lazy student too. It was a huge deal for me to read that first book.

Im now  and I rarely touch the television.  Its a rare movie that makes me jump up and pump my fists in triumph then later weep with empathy..  where books are concerned its just what Ive come to expect.  I started with Stephen King and Dean Koontz then my Grandfather of all people introduced me to FantasySciFi and historical fiction.  I also discovered Audible.com so I could listen to books while I drive or work in the yard.  Ive read thousands of books but the impact of the first  was significant.

And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than the other birds upon the plain even though they soar.,books,d8o5miu,436,t5_2qh4i

9248196,0,t3_56zy63,Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. While the novel is a rollercoaster of emotions and drug fueled madness it is all just decoration. The novel is really about this passageStrange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime or at least a Main Erathe kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not in the long run but no explanation no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant.History is hard to know because of all the hired bullshit but even without being sure of history it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash for reasons that nobody really understands at the timeand which never explain in retrospect what actually happened.My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nightsor very early morningswhen I left the Fillmore halfcrazy and instead of going home aimed the big  Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherders jacket booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond not quite sure which turnoff to take when I got to the other end always stalling at the tollgate too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change... but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was No doubt at all about thatThere was madness in any direction at any hour. If not across the Bay then up the Golden Gate or down  to Los Altos or La Honda. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right that we were winning.And that I think was the handlethat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense we didnt need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fightingon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.So now less than five years later you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the highwater markthat place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.,books,d8o9z44,1,t5_2qh4i

It was raw and bleak and refreshingly evocative. Honestly it managed to suck me in from the beginning and thats not something that often happens with YA novels. So what went wrong? Romance thats what. Gosh I love romance as much as the next personprobably morebut I honestly felt that it detracted from the story. I thought the book would be one of selfdiscovery and overcoming depression but instead it fell into the love solves everything trap. Im still going to finish it currently  into it because as unhappy as I am with the direction the book went Im still really invested in the lives of the characters and I want to see how everything will pan out.

He played for damn near three hours and several encores. I am sure at some point most of the crowd was originally there just to see him. The three other shows were not so good and in fact one of them was so bad some folks demanded and received a refund partially because of the Target Centers horrible acoustics. I would see him play again if he is near the Bay Area where I now reside.

Can recite the lyrics to hundreds of Dylan songs and can play many as well.  But the last time I saw Bob in concert I literally did not realize he was playing Dont Think Twice Its Alright.   The tempo was changed the instrumentation was different the key was changed.  And Dylan himself was unintelligible.  He croaked the lyrics.  For my  bucks Id rather sit at home with a single malt and a copy of Nashville Skyline.  ,books,d8xxd26,130,t5_2qh4i

Her world building is amazing and I love the characters  but also have moments of disliking them which I like. There are four books in the series the fourth was written after readers demanded more closure and I highly recommend giving them a shot. Theyre cheap in the kindle store!

The other class Gothic Literature we watched it for fun. In English we had to write an essay comparing a character from Mother Abigails crew and a character from The Walking Dudes crew.

Its a good  pages long and really a bit of a slog to dead at least for me but it works amazingly because a big part of the book is focused on an outnumbered army escorting a horde of starving refugees across a desert. With each chapter this march gets more embittered and fatigued and it mirrors exactly how I felt reading page after page of morose dialogue describing these desperate people. The long slog was perfect. I dont think it was altogether intended as all these books are  page behemoths but it resonatesd with me nonetheless. ,books,d9d7mrx,1,t5_2qh4i

Same for male and female protagonist right now I am so tired of female lead characters in novels they are all running together for me. This will change of course eventually.

WoT is a much more coherent story and while the world building may be larger in scope for MBoF it is only so because there are a lot of things mentioned in passing and not explained. As for atmosphere that is very subjective and I cant really discuss that but for me personally I liked WoTs more.The thing that clinches it for me most of the time is that WoT has amazing battles and actions scenes to the point where I get goose bumps reading them. I have not encounter a fantasy writer to this day that writes a more exciting action scene.

9523091,0,t3_5ba7dc,Thanks for doing this!. Where do you see your book fitting into the wider field of Canadian literary writing about the war? There are so many of them that focus on the concerns of the home front and of noncombatants in various ways so yours seems to be falling more into the legacy if not the intent or tone of something like Charles Yale Harrisons Generals Die in Bed Timothy Findleys The Wars or even Vern Thiessens play Vimy. Is Killing is a Sin placed in any sort of indirect dialogue with work like this? Is it he says hopefully maybe meant as a sort of antidote to anything? . I saw but decided not to intervene in a short but intense debate between you and some other users in rWWI the other day over how the Somme  and by proxy the war itself  is properly to be understood. Is this the sort of debate youve encountered regularly throughout your career as a military historian? What about as a soldier? I have no doubt that its going to come up again for you as a novelist too but Im sure youre quite aware of that yourself!.

Now that it does exist nothing would make me happier than to have it reproduced again and again and vastly improved upon by all the fiveyearolds in town. I would love for your children to find pleasantly and playfully what it took me many angry years to find.I now give you my word of honor that the picture your city now owns shows everything about life which truly matters with nothing left out. It is a picture of the awareness of every animal. It is the immaterial core of every animal  the I am to which all messages are sent. It is unwavering and pure no matter what preposterous adventure may befall us. A sacred picture of Saint Anthony alone is one vertical unwavering band of light. If a cockroach were near him or a cocktail waitress the picture would show two such bands of light. It is all that is alive in any of usin a mouse in a deer in a cocktail waitress. Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.gtWhat is that perfect picture which any fiveyearold can paint?

I however was on week two and had read every other book on the cell block. I actually read every other book twice at least by the time I got released. It was a bummer at the time but being an avid reader I had to complete the series of all the books I had read once I was out. FYI was for a DUI while I was in the Marine Corps. Was being treated for PTSD Depression Traumatic Brain Injury from an IED in Afghanistan.

When I start reading books from them I dont want to put them down. I found myself pausing my video games just to read another chapter in between play.

9753146,0,t3_5elz75,The truth is I hope they serve beer in Hell by Tucker Max. Was probably the most influential book of my s. Mainly because it got me back into reading. It happened to have that effect for a lot of my friends.  Also  Tuckers book list was full of many of the suggestions posted here. Which is how I stumbled upon The Alchemist  Paulo Coelho which then literally changed my life.  Its a soul touching book that makes you believe in the possibility of nearly everything.From there I remember moving on to Thomas Jefferson  The Art of Power his biography. And I found myself midway through realizing I didnt want to read a book on Jefferson. I wanted to read the books he read. I wanted to get his understanding of the world. So I looked into the Jefferson Bible. Started a spiritual endeavor. Which major books I remember being End of Faith Sam Harris  Tao of Pooh  Benjamin Hof Tuesdays with Morrie  Mitch Albom The Last Lecture  Randy Pausch. These books all together helped me learn there is a difference between faith and understanding. Between physical presence and mental presence. How to live and how to die. The next book came to me at just the right time.  It is Drive  Daniel Pink it is a Nonfiction book. That after watching a very compelling documentary series Zeitgeist really drove home a new reality of human nature for me.  Growing up in the capitalist society of the United States we get a real black and white image of what motivates people.  Basically Adam Smith mixed with Machiavelli.  This book flips our beliefs of the carrot and the stick motivator on its head.  It made me empathize greatly with my generation that blindly went forward in school and careers without any real questioning of their own motivations. It was simply the right thing to do. This answer may not be what youre looking for exactly but I felt compelled to write my story. I think because I read a lot of the books people say here as well.  A lot of those books you sit with and they stay with you subconsciously for a while.  They appear in your everyday life and you say oh Ahab or ah the universe speaking to me again. But some books just black and white build structure into your identity. Which is what we do in our twenties we try and understand as much of the world as possible.  We try to get all the answers and we try to move forward. They may be great for your subject. But I think there are sometimes questions you sit with repetitively in your s. And all these books touch on multiple questions. Sometimes though you need to find the source of your question. If youre struggling with death I dare you to read Tuesdays with Morrie and not come out feeling more at peace. That is basically what Im trying to get at. With all that said I would use Alice in Wonderland for your project.  Its a book full of symbolism and easy to read over and over again.  Anna Karenina is hard enough to get through once let alone twice in a single semester.  Plus you can learn the most valuable lesson a single line of literature has taught me.  Youre entirely bonkers.

I absolutely loved the recent Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell all of the Discworld adaptations but particularly Hogfather and Going Postal the neverwhere adaptation with Peter Capaldi.For the worst I have to say the Sword of Truth show. I loved the early books I liked the show at the beginning and it was still better than a lot of what was on broadcast tv at the time but it went way off the rails very fast. It unfortunately fell in that time just before original streaming content had become a viable medium it was happening but pretty experimentally I think it would have done splendidly if it had been developed a little more hard Rrated as a streaming only just a few years later.,books,dahs19e,1,t5_2qh4i

9775420,0,t3_5f6cdj,The Stranger is basically a reductio ad well absurdum. It takes an absurdist character i.e. someone who believes that theres no deeper meaning to be found in life and with the the help of extremely unfortunate events makes a statement about how people like Meursault would fair in society. Camus once said that The Stranger is about how any man who does not weep at his mothers funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death. While that was obviously a hyperbole which he later expanded upon you can see this sentiment in the story. If Meursaults feeling and actions were more in tune with society he wouldve condemned Raymond for beating his girlfriend and thus wouldnt have associated with him. This wouldve prevented him from even getting into the situation with the Arabs. Likewise if he had shown remorse and guilt regarding the murder he couldve probably convinced the chaplain to put in a good word in court and save him from the death penalty. He couldve easily claimed to have been emotionally unstable and generally confused following the death of his mother. But he didnt because he wasnt. ,books,dai1bsr,10,t5_2qh4i

9797185,0,t1_dakkxaj,Yeah there are some good passages one never hears about from Smiths fans on the right. For instance heres Smith endorsing progressive tax ratesgtThe proportion of the expence of houserent to the whole expence of living is different in the different degrees of fortune. It is perhaps highest in the highest degree and it diminishes gradually through the inferior degrees so as in general to be lowest in the lowest degree. The necessaries of life occasion the great expence of the poor. They find it difficult to get food and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expence of the rich and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon houserents therefore would in general fall heaviest upon the rich and in this sort of inequality there would not perhaps be any thing very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expence not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion.And heres Smith demonstrating he understands the importance relative poverty how poor one is within ones society not just absolute material povertygtBy necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people even of the lowest order to be without. A linen shirt for example is strictly speaking not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived I suppose very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times through the greater part of Europe a creditable daylabourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which it is presumed nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom in the same manner has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England. The poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear in public without them. In Scotland custom has rendered them a necessary of life to the lowest order of men but not to the same order of women who may without any discredit walk about barefooted. In France they are necessaries neither to men nor to women the lowest rank of both sexes appearing there publicly without any discredit sometimes in wooden shoes and sometimes barefooted. Under necessaries therefore I comprehend not only those things which nature but those things which the established rules of decency have rendered necessary to the lowest rank of people.,books,dakpqke,121,t5_2qh4i

As it is all an illusion you get lured into the illusions of others and seek things material pursuits beyond your need or reach. As you cant attain this it leads to unhappiness and you blame the universe fate for what is inherently chasing a mirage.Accept this world of illusions do your duty this is very important and stressed often in the Gita but accept the transient nature of the world as well as the fact that many pieces on the board move outside of your control.

9854322,0,t1_dary6hc,I never said that academic subjects should not be taught. However is harder to teach students the concept of functional accomplishment in the more abstract subjects. What are students going to do in biology that will affect their daily lives? Breed a new color of blossoming pea? Perform gel electrophoresis and diagnose predisposition to breast cancer?Youve got to start smaller. Everyone eats so learn to cook food. Growing some would be even better.Everyone wears clothes so learn to make a shirtshorts.Everyone spends money so learn to write a budget.Everyone is going to need something assembled or built some day even if it is just an Ikea bookshelf so learn to read plans and use tools.These are also basics which can be used to start building careers in Fine Dining fashion accounting or construction.But all of these are teaching the same thing doing. Doing for yourself.And all of that means living a life where you dont spend twice what you need to on restaurants and convenience food because you cant cook throwing away clothes because of lost buttons going into debt paying off payday loans and overdrafts and buying cases of beer for annoyed friends to get your TV stand built.Being your own person starts small. Without a foundation of these small accomplishments to build from the larger steps toward building a career or profession can be or seem insurmountable.Worse not teaching simple physical skills can discourage kids from pursuing well paid careers in physical trades like plumbing electrical or other building trades that literally construct the world that we live in. A child could have a gift for artisan furniture that goes undiscovered because they never had a chance to work with a piece of wood.The world is not an abstract place we have to live in it.

Its easier for me to dial manually! I was like no its not! I even showed her that manually it takes you  button presses. Via the saved contacts on the phone itll take you  button presses.

And since it was already mentioned here is another one. A Wind In the Door by  Madeleine LEngle. She was the first chapter book I ever read. I was in third grade and a teacher handed it to me because the ones we were supposed to be reading for class were too boring. That book made realize that books were magic. They could transport you to other worlds and other places you could never see in your life. I also read Many Waters and Ring of Endless Light when I was . They also had a pretty profound affect on the way I think about life and the way I think about myself. ,books,das55rk,1,t5_2qh4i

9856135,0,t3_5gfq2f,Albert Camus The Stranger had a big impact on me when I was  and Its still one of my favorite books. It helped me understand how pointless hubris and selfpity are.The main character is unremarkable and impossible to relate to but his personality reflects the benign indifference of the universe to human suffering which he acknowledges at the end of the book.,books,das9zxt,1,t5_2qh4i
9856741,0,t1_das3kbv,I get why people dont like this chapter I didnt like it at first but on second thoughts I thought it was good.Firstly its true that people dont change like that overnight but in this particular book everything else happens in very compressed time periods too. His initial crimewave is just two nights and a day of nearconstant crime. His mental conditioning in prison takes just a couple of weeks where any such program in real life would probably take months. When hes let out his decline takes just another day and a night or so of things constantly happening during which time he just happens to meet nearly all the characters from the first chapters one after another. The book is never particularly realistic with time scales or that sort of thing it has a fable quality right from the start so I dont think it is inconsistent with the writing style that his last period of becoming mature would happen overnight too.Secondly you have to remember Alex is part of the Nadsat culture which is extremely violent and has extreme fashions and is specifically limited to teenage culture. It is a parody or exaggeration of teen culture which was emerging in the s and s with a lot of concerns from older people. Most people do change very quickly at the end of their teenage years at  or  they often look back at themselves just a couple of years earlier with horror at their choice of clothes and friends and behaviour. Burgess has just exaggerated the speed of this process of maturity same way as he exaggerated the gang violence slang drug taking trouble with authority changing fashion bad music and everything else that is associated with teenage culture.Thirdly  and most importantly  there is the theme of free will vs social conditioning. Are people susceptible to mindcontrol with programmable behaviour like clockwork or are they creatures of flesh and blood that grow in their own natural way like an orange? In the last chapter Burgess shows that they are both Alex has totally shaken off the effects of his artificial behaviour modification in prison but then his free will to carry on the Nadsat lifestyle is completely overridden by his own natural instincts his hormones or whatever it is that makes him want to settle down to a quiet family life. So its both a positive and a negative ending Alex will leave the life of crime but not because he has learned its wrong but because he is just a puppet doing whatever his human programming tells him to do.,books,dascu7s,4,t5_2qh4i

That of course is only my own opinion.A lot of people share that opinion though. Id argue that racking up a literary resume like his would be tough for somebody without any talent. That said I think this questions whole premise is flawed.At the risk of being a didactic prick does the answer to a question like whether somebody has artistic talent or not become objectively correct if enough people choose the same way? Can the subjective be made objective by sheer overwhelming consensus? Or perhaps by the strength of the rhetoric with which its argued and supported?No of course not. Not without some serious philosophical bending of things. Opinions remain opinions and theyre often even harder to change than the facts.I think McCarthys incredibly skilled at his craft.

9981468,0,t3_5ihpl8,I think some people relate to things easier when that thing resonates with themselves...which is why this book hit home for me. Because I had to read for  pages about a teenager living life without purpose or meaning just floating by. He doesnt value himself as worthwhile he simply doesnt care. But at the same time he does care.He cares about his sister and wants to see her laugh and smile and deep down he just wants someone to think about him in the same light. He calls everyone a phony but the biggest phony of all is himself. To face himself in the reality of who he is to me is his deepest fear something that hes been running away from. Trying to live a life without bother wanting to live far away from people...but he cant outrun himself. Emotional neglect is a serious issue these thoughts he has are reinforced because of how clearly clueless his parents are. What I get out of it is...that type of feeling is not okay. Its not okay to be like Holden to run away from your emotions and fears for the rest of your life. Its not okay to float by. This feeling tears him apart every second of every day  he doesnt know what to do how to go forward and why he should. I feel terrible for Holden because just like myself even if deep down you feel like youre fading away you still have the ability to put on the mask of illusion that wipes that thought away from anyones brain and convinces them youre just some sarcastic asshole.I really like what ufusionnoble remembers from his teacher gt I hated the book at first as I was forced to read it in highschool but then my teacher asked me one question and I slowly loved the book.She asked me why do you think he cared so much about the ducks?I think he cares so much about the ducks as he stares at them lost in the world wondering...how...how do they know what to do next?

Youre a person who recognizes his ranting and raving for the defense mechanism that it actually is. It didnt click for me when I was younger because I fell between those two options. I didnt share his opinions so I couldnt outright identify and I was so wrapped up in my own angst and problems that I couldnt recognize the similarities between Holden and myself until much later in life. ,books,db8qnt8,0,t5_2qh4i

The dude served in a lot more dangerous areas than I did I met him on my first his third deployment. He told me that reading the book after living with ptsd completely changes the dynamic. He saw it as JD Salinger trying to deal with the world. A world he cant connect with but is forced to live in.

9986324,0,t3_5ihpl8,As a millennial I agree that with you completely.I had to read it during highschool and I thought it was bad. Like shockingly bad and holding no relatable values to a modern audience at all. Holden was annoying hypocritical immature and above all naive. All his complaints about people being shallow phonies or fakes made me think isnt this obvious? or why are you only realising this now? He was like the edgy angsty teen that never did anything but complain. The fact that he acted he was above it all and superior was even more cringeworthy. The modern equivalent of Holden would be those SHOCKING clickbait articles about how company X are or Breaking News! People are vain! or that naive person who goes up to people exclaiming hisher realisation that there are starving children in Africa.I get that its specifically a product of its time. I get that it is important because it was the first book of its kind. I get why I had to study it. But that doesnt mean that it is appealing to a modern audience. Remember that this is the generation which grew up surrounded by documentaries shallow Hollywood movies current affair and political news broadcasts. ,books,db98vcp,0,t5_2qh4i

10010457,0,t1_dbcdb9d,I guess Im crazy for suggesting that if someone feels as though they are the opposite gender of their birth they should receive counselling rather than pumping an abnormal amount of hormones into their body. There is a biological difference between Men and Women and the current solution embraced by the mainstream is cruel and unusual. If youre born a man and feel like a woman you can pump estrogen into your bloodstream and get a doctor to push your penis inside your body but youll still have broad shoulders larger jawline thicker bone density narrow hips etc. No matter how this man feels he will never truly understand what it feels like to be born a woman.Now you call me a bigot but I have had this discussion with a transwoman before. While she did not agree with me she did hear out some undeniable truths I just laid out above. I dont hate anybody or condone violence against transpeople.

10014751,0,t3_5ivaav,So much has changed me because of books. I feel like many times Im reading my own writing because of how relatable what I read seems. Something I recently read which really twisted where Im at vs where my values lie is the book The Alchemist.Im not going to run after the book to get the quote but something something the main character is on his personal quest and his calling is to go to the pyramids. He ends up in an oasis camp and gets settled down after predicting a raid by a local tribe and finds he likes this lot in life he finds a beautiful desert woman and a community that accepts him. Basically at this point hes like hell to the pyramid dream Im happy here. But the alchemist shows up and tells him thatHe can predict his future accurately. Hell find the work fulfilling for some time hell have great love with his new found lover and will be venerated by the community. BUT if he leaves he will forever regret abandoning the unfulfilled personal quest ahead of him. So he goes out to find it. Its a really simple message that illustrates my personal mild discomfort that I fall into in my reality and that many of my feelings of adventure and fulfillment are repressed for something less than and more like stepping stones to reaching my potential.,books,dbcy8jz,3,t5_2qh4i

10083702,0,t3_5k6ma8,Space and portability is a big factor. I travel fairly regularly even if its just to see my parents and I dont have to worry about lugging around  books with me. Im more of a minimalist so I like having more space in my apartment too. I love being able to have hundreds of books at my fingertips.Dictionary look up and translation are also huge factors. I dont have to put down the book and type in a word on my phone to figure out what a word means. Kindle has google translate pretty well incorporated too so thats a nice bonus for those phrases that are in a different language.The kindle is lightweight and easier to hold for long periods of time. I can stand it up origami cover and read it while laying on my side. Having a kindle with the light means you dont have to worry about the lighting situation around you.Instant gratification. I can buy a book and download it instantly. I can also browse through overdrive and check out books via my local library and also get those instantly.Some drawbacksNo shelves full of pretty books to display. Or this shelf is at least not as full as it would be otherwise.A bit more clunky to navigate through a whole book. You can have bookmarks on a kindle but if you want to do a bunch of noteshighlighting it can be a bit clunky on a kindle IMO. This would probably be easier and more intuitive the more you do it on an ereader.Cant loan someone an ebookor theres an annoying process to go through to do it I.e. You have a friend over they see your shelf and you can let them borrow a book. Said situation Doesnt really happen with an ebook.Childrens books pictures cookbooks books with diagrams etc. For very young children they probably shouldnt have a  eink device with fragile screens as they will break in no time. If books have a lot of pictures or diagrams the reading experience isnt going to be pleasant on a kindle. A tablet make that better but sometimes its nice to have a printed book instead.,books,dblxbpc,5,t5_2qh4i

Or for temporally nonlinear stories I write down when clues are revealed how old certain characters are in relation to each other and the event thats occurring which creates a sort of timeline. I also write down questions that beg answering when its not immediately obvious why certain things happened the amount of unanswered questions I have when I finish tells me how wellwritten the story is.

10096440,0,t1_dbngnlq,I get the feeling I should define when I say fantasy as general word for whatever would fall outside realisms relations.I think I would almost have to argue against magical realism being an inherently cultural style more a set of tools employed to cultural ends.  That it can be so easily be thought of in terms of absurdism is kind of an indicator of that in my opinion.    I think of it in terms of surrealism and its early eschewing of commercialism yet I would argue the tools of surrealism are widely employed in underpinning the modern commercial system think of well most commercials these days...I seem to recall one with a squirrel living in freezer in the back of planes headrest dispensing...cant remember what the product was...  But doesnt that just sound like something youd expect to see at one of the original surrealist exhibitions?I must say I dont care for timeless truth.  The idea strikes as me too much a defense mechanism a more generalized version of the attempts to unify all mythologies in midtwentieth century so that ours is by definition is right because its in all others rather than say that of say nonwestern mythology or reduce ours to commonality of everything else.  Concepts of timelessness and universality I think I would have to agree with Roger Taylor in that its creation that functions as the life support system of the notion of art.  We reference writings such as Shakespeares from with cultures that inculcate us from the youngest age about the status of these symbols.  To make the point theres a book by John Jones called On Aristotle and Greek Tragedy that shows just how far we go in misunderstanding misrepresenting the nature of classical Greek drama in the whole of the leadup to modern society.   And to take your point about understanding within the context of the tradition if we must have that how can we have that? and if there must be tradition how can there be timelessness?These criticisms of Goldfinch keep reminding me on the kerfuffle between Ursula Le Guin and Kazuo Ishiguro.  These sorts of things more and more seem to me to be taking on the role of annuallyenacted ritualism.  That was last year .  Ben Marcus  vs Franzen was .  I wonder who itll be for . All I can think at the moment is that somehow though I dont exactly how Tristan Tzara was right Dada doubts everything. Dada is an armadillo. Everything is Dada too. Beware of Dada.

This way I can satisfy all my reading moods without guilt and I dont feel pressured to read through one book entirely before reading something else.,books,dbo2t41,1,t5_2qh4i

10103927,0,t3_5kk2jq,Let me hazard a guess. A guess because Ive never read anything by her.So she wrote this one very politically relevant book.. it was relevant to a particular country and a particular culture as well as to a particular set of people in the particularly biased media. If you werent relevant you read it as if someone was hit a bit on the head as it is often is with strongly biased political novels whose authors live in their own bizarre bubbles of reality. She is politically active so she is given accolades nominations etc based on primarily this and then perhaps some other factors. She is being touted as a master writer even though nothing else managed to get this sort of recognition and her books are not known for any other particularly great or innovative elements. Whenever people talk about Atwood I cant help by think of Rand. Similar case opposite end of the spectrum. Perhaps Atwood has more skill.

It counts!Ive worked with friends who have vision loss and audiobooks are the primary way if not the only way that blind folks consume literature not all blind people use braille its expensive and heavy when were talking War and Peace. I am firmly of the opinion that it counts as reading. With so many disabilities and ways of absorbing content I am happy that audiobooks make literature inclusive for all.  One of my blind friends once she got over the perceived snobbery that she wasnt really reading felt very liberated after she read her first audio book. Its not like a movie. Im receiving the same words.I know many folks who are holding themselves back because they are very aware of the judgment about audio books vs ahem real books.

I thought The Tiger was a really interesting nonfiction read that gave an unique view for a Westerner like myself into the political economic and sociocultural history of imperial Russia the USSR PostSoviet Russia perestroika and native Siberians as compared to Cossacks or ethnic Russians. Writing about these subjects both explicity and via narrative vignettes and evolutionary biology concerning tigers particularly the Siberian or Amur tiger was unique in my opinion.

However the  Hour brand became synonymous with practical least effort maximum effect tips and strategies for anything business cooking fitness.Theres nothing really special about Tim Ferris even he would admit it. What he brings is a well researched sometimes well experimented alternatives to common problems. He is refreshingly simple and clear. He is not giving aways trade secrets just sound advice from concrete sources. He knows his readers and how radical some of his ideas may seem.I agree with you no business book will give you information that you couldnt find or figure out for yourself. In the case of Tim he is well informed and willing to share his findings.Bottom line Ive always learned something new and different from his books.

10283575,0,t1_dc9jlcd,I think some authors have taken to using previously written books as descriptors because especially if youre dealing with genre fiction reference to a particular book series or author allow for a commonly understood descriptive shorthand.When people say The XXXX Game of Thrones what theyre talking about is a work of fantasy consisting of a complex web of well written characters featured in interconnected stories and political machinations which unfold contemporaneously in brutish violent well realized low fantasy world conveyed to the reader through the perspective of recurring point of view characters and in which as the plot moves along important characters can and do die. . . except that instead of being set in Martins world the setting is instead XXXX.So when James talks about writing an African Game of Thrones hes talking about writing genre fiction with a specific feel about it set in either fantastic version of Africa or an African inspired fantasy world in such a way that the meaning can be conveyed with a maximum degree of brevity something important for articles press releases and advertising.The fact that folks really like Game of Thrones and want something similar doesnt hurt the case for such metaphors either.,books,dc9p76s,6,t5_2qh4i

10352455,0,t3_5o8qpg,I dont know the exact answer to how did they know but I did find this page The citation at the bottom says that there were few people who would have had Mr. Darcys income so one reason for the knowledge could be that he was one of the few really wealthy people. Gossip is probably how they got the exact sums. Servants telling servants? Thats my guess. As for the conversations being rude... yes they were which is why you get the info from Mrs. Bennet. Her character is a rude pushy mother who cares more about getting her daughters ahead than societal norms. Finally like with all things the Victorians tended to talk a big talk but liked to do the opposite of what they should. Edit Here is a post from raskhistorians that has a lot of good info including a link to the full paper that table comes from. Full disclosure I havent read it but it probably has some insight in it. The post also talks about how at least for Mr. Bingley the money was from inheritance  may also be a stepping stone to finding your exact answer. ,books,dchieyz,7,t5_2qh4i

10476087,0,t3_5pvmwv,Certain books like maybe Fahrenheit  or Animal Farm have an ideological value that I can definitely stand behind. Also maybe a couple of the books I had to read in school like The Pigman or Go Ask Alice. Those last two there are probably modern versions of I mean different more recent novels about ethics and counterculture that are even more relevant to current youth. But as far as the canonical classics there are only a few of them that have the same value today that they had for a good long time in the past. I have read things like Dostoyevsky and the Brontes and Nathaniel Hawthorne and I feel comfortable telling you that the majority of them you can skip and never regret it or miss out on anything. What I do think is important is that you read some things by thinkers  whether fiction or nonfiction read some stuff about ideas about human nature read things that challenge and interest you.

10476439,0,t1_dcvl4cx,It is a long list so let me give you a hand there.gtDisdain for Intellectuals and the Arts  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education and academia.All this talk about liberal elites by Trump sycophants thinly veiled attacks on the highly educated on the basis that theyre somehow disconnected from working America just because they earn their averageass salary at a University rather than an office cubicle or a sales floor.gtObsession with Crime and Punishment  Under fascist regimes the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. Trump has gone on and on about how hell be a law and order president. In response to police abuses Trump has taken issue with activist responses and promised as per the official WH page to eliminate what he calls a dangerous antipolice atmosphere.gtCorporate Power is Protected  The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power creating a mutually beneficial businessgovernment relationship and power elite.Trump has hired six former Goldman Sachs employees. Hes nominated Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. Hes flagrantly mixing big business and government. Furthermore hes cozied up quite closely to megarich businessmen donors like Sheldon Adelson and Peter Thiel to whom he is indebted for their efforts in getting him elected.gtReligion and Government are Intertwined  Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the governments policies or actions.Trump may as well have been reading the list like an itinerary when he said We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we are protected by God at his inauguration. Hes consistently used Christianity to win over conservative voters despite being an exceptionally wealthy businessman and unrepentant adulterer two things which by any account Jesus would take issue with.In conclusion is the United States suddenly a fascist dystopia? Of course not. But Trump and his most powerful supporters and followers have been laying the discursive groundwork of fascism since his campaign began. Now that hes president the threat only becomes more serious.,books,dcvm2vv,6,t5_2qh4i

When theyre fed caricatures like ministry of truth you hear even people on reddit recite that a factbased institution is actually the ministry of truth. Who decides whats fact? Who decides whats truth?Although I dispute that a totalitarian structure would like a divided nation. A totalitarian structure would like a united nation united under him. Education is relative. And when everyone is falsely made to believe that politics is subjective and everyones opinion is equal even though that is patently false some opinions are better than others Joe everybody is fed the belief that he is educated and thats more harmful that actually being educated.

10494889,0,t1_dcxexwg,Its a warning about how power corrupts people regardless of their ideals or ideology. It also concerns revolutions once a revolutionary government becomes institutionalized its priorities change from a overthrowing the tyrannical old order amp setting up a new ideal state to b maintaining its own continued existence expanding its power base and deriving benefits for individuals at the top of the power structure. Animal Farm is a warning about what is known in ethics as the principalagent problem gt Common examples of this relationship include corporate management agent and shareholders principal or politicians agent and voters principal. Consider a legal client the principal wondering whether their lawyer the agent is recommending protracted legal proceedings because it is truly necessary for the clients well being or because it will generate income for the lawyer. In fact the problem can arise in almost any context where one party is being paid by another to do something where the agent has a small or nonexistent share in the outcome whether in formal employment or a negotiated deal such as paying for household jobs or car repairs. ,books,dcxpfa0,2,t5_2qh4i

A great example of something film can generally do better than literature creating irony and meaning out of a juxtaposition of images or a contrast between whats said and whats shown. It even functions as a nice character beat by showing the naivet of Rs fantasies about the Living world. But I think my favorite scene has to be the bedroom and the transition into the orchard. When Julie says Youre a good person R and you see on his face how little he believes it that part jerks a tear from me every time. And then the way it leads into the dream sequence in that gorgeous orchard. The book has a lot of stylized layers of realitydreams flashbacks brain visions voices inside heads etcand there isnt much of that in the movie but this might be the part where the movie matches the book most closely in tone and style.

But a google search will generally reveal that there are a lot of legal opinions that scanning an entire book for personal use would be laughed out of court under fair use provisions.Remember that music companies also specifically prohibited ripping of CDs in their terms and conditions. That did not stop the courts from finding that ripping for personal use is legal under fair use provisions.I think there is a very good reason that publishing house have never tested this in court because if they lost it would set a legal precedent.And I find it very difficult to sympathise with them given that they are the same bastards that keep lobbying to change the law and extend copyright length everytime older works will enter the public domain.,books,ddbka06,2,t5_2qh4i

No one lasts forever.  Which would have gone great with the whole entropy kipple theme in the book.It would have been even better then if Roy had answered Really?

I held off watching the movies for those until I read the book exactly for that reason but I will debate that Fight Club at least has a very very good reason for reading it. Just imagine how a writer would have to hide the major spoiler about that story into text flow. The only book I deem equal to that is Agatha Christies Murder of Roger Aykroyd.Yet what I was talking about is the fact that despite our beliefs about whether or not the books of cult films deserve to be read or not there are audiences who read them. ASoIaF is not the sort that everyone who watches the show feels like reading. I know someone who hates reading but she read HP after watching the movies countless times. She wanted more. Same goes for when I read novelizations of some of my favourite movies.However there are many readers who love the show and will still not read ASoIaF. I read those books growing up and Im the exact opposite. I have stopped caring about that story to even bother watching a single episode. I havent watched any. Entertaining perhaps.

10693334,0,t1_ddipock,Im genuinely confused by this attitude. Harry Potter bored me by being formulaic and often inconsistent. Lord of the Rings built a fantastic world and had a compelling story. It was obvious a lot of Harry Potters plot was stuff happens hints about Harry being THE CHOSEN ONE and then wrap it up and leave it for the next book. Lord of the Rings had interesting information on every single page if you were paying attention.For a lot of people Lord of the Rings Chronicles of Narnia and other Fantasy novels from the wellknown like Age of Conan or The Once and Future King to the lesserknown pulp fantasy books were the entry point.The distinction people seem to be making is about Well when I was young all the nerds read.... Harry Potter seems to get a lot of credit just for making kids read but that on its own is not a particularly valuable distinction. Lots of teenagers read Twilight but I doubt many of them have used that as a gateway to fantasy novels. Likewise I know plenty of people who adore Harry Potter... but have either only seen the movies or loved the books but never really read anything. And Im sure some of that is just the decreasing popularity of the format combined with the difficulties of finding time to read as they get older but I cant help but feel the sort of people who adored Lord of the Rings are the bookloving types who enjoyed them for their quality while the Harry Potter crowd was mainly kids on a hype train.Its sort of like saying Well at least major blockbuster movie will get people to go to a theater!. Sure but all the hype in the world means nothing if your movie is forgotten in the subsequent months. Harry Potter is notable for being notable. Lord of the Rings is notable for having a richlydetailed world and excellent character development. My point is for a lot of us Lord of the Rings is the entry point in the pipeline not the end goal. And Id argue its a far better introduction and indicator of later interest than Harry Potter is.,books,ddixsc7,12,t5_2qh4i

Modern Western Realism plays give you only dialogue and objective driven characters. You have to fill in the narrative lines and naturally have to analyze to understand. If you like it plays are never long reads you read again following  character. Find what they want how they get it and why?  Reflect on what the piece meant.Or see plays with friends and dissect them afterwards. This is coming from an actorteacher of theatre. Most of the history buffs I knew were either dramaturgs or  minored in Theatre to take the history classes. The classes covered the same movements they had studied from a completely different view.

Used that way filling out the planet with multiple cultures and peoples and complex politics actually detracts from the story the author is trying to tell because it obscures the point hes trying to make with extraneous detail. Creating a complex world with multiple cultures is like Chekhovs Gun If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise dont put it there. If your world has a complex web of cultures that complexity had better have an impact on the story or youre misleading your readers and wasting time that could be spent advancing the story.Some stories need fully fleshed out worlds some dont.

It ignores what books have been and what books can do.Non fiction biographies are a great way to learn about society and recent history. Non fiction technical books can teach you about the world as we know it. Both are great things of use.Fiction can explore the issues of the day. Human condition as the author perceives it. The greatest fears and hopes of where society might go. Throughout history fiction has been the safe method for social commentary. After all its just a story. Science fiction and fantasy have even more free reign to bring to light issues in our world. Subjects most people dont and wont face head on can be brought up and explored. After all its not even based on reality.As far as junk literature. Both fiction and nonfiction are full of it. Fiction can be nothing but a bit of escapism. Is that a bad thing. Is taking a moment away from your world to another really a flaw or a healthy way to decompress and relax. Along those lines some non fiction can be gossip and intrusion. Is pulling apart another life for your enjoyment really superior? I see many biographies written about tragic lives of people that worked hard to keep their pain out of the spot light.

That might not be the one Im remembering and they only killed around  people there because it became or the one I remember a sort of show camp that the Nazis used for propaganda by showing Jews playing football matches or holding meetings and debates.

10989710,0,t3_5wuwwc,My best friends favourite book is  Shades of Grey. Do I think its a pile of complete crap? Yes. Do I think any less of her for loving it? Hell no. Not all people read for the same reasons. My best friend for example is a young working mum who only reads one or two books a year and just wants complete escapism and some pulp fiction to lose herself in. She enjoys it and so have millions of other people so good for her. It doesnt make her any less of an amazing friend and mother. Just because we dont have this one thing in common doesnt change how I regard her.This is why I go on goodreads Reddit and Booktube. I dont have many people in my life who do like reading a lot of books and reading a bit more critically and occasionally to help educate ourselves. I get that from the internet instead. You just need to find a group of people who are into the same things as you and youll realise you have no right to judge other peoples taste. Theres someone who is probably better read than you who would look at your favourite books and think theyre absolute crap  just like someone would probably do to me too. But it doesnt matter! Funnily enough you should read a book called Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes and it will make you think about how you judge others in your life. I can understand why you had that initial thought but just remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion  even if it differs from yours! Just maybe keep more of your literary conversations with others who are more like minded and youll realise that shes completely entitled to enjoy that book! ,books,dednda2,1,t5_2qh4i

You can have cartoonish violence or realistic violence but it gets jarring and dissonant when you treat cartoonish violence as realistic or realistic violence as cartoonish and torture is a fast way to cross that line. Like if you were watching Tom and Jerry beat the shit out of each other and all of a sudden there was a straight up torture scene and one character actually reacted as if they were in real pain that would be horrifying. But if youre watching some rated R horror movie then torture is just bland.Torture in a realistic setting is easy to treat realistically it clearly marks the torturer as evil but it isnt really shocking or surprising that it happens.,books,deml4z2,1,t5_2qh4i

11088814,0,t1_deowaat,I know its childish in a Harry Potter kind of way yet equally captivating. Just as in any good fantasy book he allows you to enter into the world. Hell of a writer but kinda upset that he pushed it back till  . When I read it in th grade I was perfectly happy and then theater to be continued has tortured me for the past  years.

11089019,0,t1_deou6j0,What Im saying about his writing isnt that he needs a bunch of complicated sentences and descriptions but rather that he doesnt seem to capitalize on the words he does use. He has to put words on the page to write a book but he almost seems to resent having to do so. He cares ZERO about the prose and  about the story. Which in line with my previous analogy is like a filmmaker who doesnt give a shit about cinematography.You have to write words to have a book the same way you have to shoot film to make a movie. Its missing an opportunity if you dont make them good.As an example of simple prose thats evocative like I said before look at Cormac McCarthy. The man does things with ten words that other writers couldnt do with a hundred. Admittedly thats a hard act to follow since CMC is probably one of the best living novelists but that just means theres tons to learn from him.And for your point on imagination well imagination is always doing the heavy lifting when youre reading but there are limits. At the extreme I could just say a guys parents die so he decides to dress up like a bat and fight crime and at the end he catches the bad guy and tell you to fill in the blanks. But thats no fun for obvious reasons. Im reading a book because I want the whole story in the writers words.Obviously yall can like Sanderson if you want its kind of an issue of taste and I dont hate him I think hes a good writer overall but I dont especially like the idea of him being the posterboy of fantasy for pretty much the reasons I outlined. I just think hes kind of... shallow. Hes more interested in the surface level stuff like cool magic systems and awesome sword fights than the depth and complexity of something like LOTR or ASOIAF.,books,deoxii0,4,t5_2qh4i

Not to say its a bad book but it throws you right into the story with no explanations for many complicated and important concepts and basically expects you to hit the ground running while also keeping track of minute detail that will be important three chapters or in some cases three books later without which you miss a lot of nuance to the story. This is definitely a series where the glossary and character appendix are a godsend. The later books are a lot more forgiving in this regard as Erikson became a much better writer. Not to say they arent always complex though.edit Id also say that the second book is probably the best in the series so the payoff for clearing the hurdle is pretty immediate,books,deq37si,2,t5_2qh4i

Harry Potter is a formulaic coming of age story with stock characters onto whom anyone can overlay their own persona. Its escapist fiction that extols what?loyalty courage overcoming challengesgenerally insipid themes. I dont really have a problem with any of this largely because they are childrens books. The irony with the Harry Potter fandom is that these full grown adults idolize this series that at its core is about the inevitability and necessity of growing up and leaving childhood behind.

11150855,0,t3_5z7jut,You dont need to start anywhere specific. I dove right in with Infinite Jest and started devouring postmodern novels. I slowly moved to the classics and I am now just jumping around to whatever long dense novel draws my attention. The only trick is to not give up and to realize that it does get easier. Reading is a skill you can improve. When I first read Infinite Jest it took me almost an hour to read  pages when I reread it I was able to knock out  pages in the same amount of time with better comprehension. Books that were incredibly intimidating to me two years ago now read just as smoothly as A Song of Ice and Fire or anything equally easy. I am extremely passionate about it so I worked hard  I took notes reread passages again and again until I understood them and purposefully picked progressively harder novels each time I finished one  and its paid off immensely. I dont feel lost with Pynchon anymore Gaddis doesnt scare the shit out of me and every time I pick up a new notoriously difficult book I feel only excitement. Sometimes if a writer is especially experimental it will take a few pages to get into their prose but once I do its really fun to work with the book. Most people want to have the information handed to them. They want the author to hold their hand and pull them through the story. Those are the kinds of books I avoid now. So just work at it and the classics will be a breeze before you know it. Also if you really need a starting place start with the Greeks. ,books,devxr83,7,t5_2qh4i

11151788,1,t1_devwdaz,You cannot state that church being at war with science is a myth. IIRC many people of science were shunned mocked threatened and even brutally murdered for their scientific discoveries and their status as people of science and education. The most related to this section example i can think of is the Hypatia of Alexandria who lived not too long after the burning of the library. She was of high importance as she was the head of the Platonist school teaching many important and wellknown figures and was overall liked by many. However many catholics called her a pagan and hated her. It is unclear who killed but it was established that she was brutally murdered by a religious mob or a cult dedicated to the Catholic church. It wasnt entirely religious motives as there were political clashes and disputes going on at the time but Id definitely argue that religion had a lot to do with wars and destruction and quite often acted as a catalyst. I personally have nothing against religion if it welcomes and accepts everyone and teaches everyone overall to be better people. Many catholics are wonderful people with great morals but there are extremists just like in any other religions that ruin it for the rest of us. And to remember the history as it was is important so we can learn from those mistakes. ,books,dew1ka8,-7,t5_2qh4i

11183687,0,t1_dezjmqb,I had read lots of fantasy before the WoT came out so from that perspective here is what was special about it  The world is rich and textured like a real world.  Its filled with trade routes and farmers.  Nations talk to each other and have treaties.  They have histories of wars and cultures.  Prior to Jordan fantasy worlds were patchworks of isolated kingdoms that didnt interact with each other.  They didnt trade with each other since the roads between cities were hostile... and somehow all the towns and cities had ample food despite not having farmlands.  Writers today are much better about making their fantasy worlds more textured.  But back then it was a huge jump in quality.  I also think he was one of the authors who pioneered structured magic.  His world has a magic system that is slowly explained to the reader makes sense and is also fun to read about.  ,books,deznp86,5,t5_2qh4i

11185717,0,t3_5zoqs5,gt The thesis at the heart of Hillbilly Elegy is that anybody who isnt able to escape the working class is essentially at fault. Sure theres a culture of fatalism and learned helplessness but the onus falls on the individual.Theres a lot to critique and debate about Vances book but this feels untrue or at the least disingenuous. Just from reading the course of Vances life I never took away the notion that Vance thought he made it by pulling himself up by his bootstraps. He doesnt say that the onus fell wholly on him in fact he wonders throughout the book where he might have ended up without his Mamaw Marine Corps drill instructors professors and wife. Heres a relevant example of that sentimentgt There were many thumbs put on my scale. When I look back at my life what jumps out is how many variables had to fall in place in order to give me a chance. There was my grandparents constance presence even when my mother and stepfather moved far away in an effort to shut them out. Despite the revolving door of wouldbe father figures I was often surrounded by caring and kind men. Even with her faults Mom instilled in me a lifelong love of education and learning. My sister always protected me even after Id physically outgrown her. Dan and Aunt Wee opened their home when I was too afraid to ask. Long before that they were my first real exemplars of a happy and loving marriage. There were teachers distance relatives and friends.gt Remove any of these people from the equation and Im probably screwed.If you take that passage as mere Republicanesque bootstrapping Im not sure what to say honestly other than you are probably missing the argument that Vance is making whether you ultimately agree with it or not. The last line is really the entire thesis of Vances book. He does say that public policy cannot alone solve these problems but he never really says that the onus falls on the individual but that it falls on the community in his case the hillbilly community. Thats his thesis that we need a strong commitment of smart policy and robust active communities filled with people who truly love each other to turn these situations around.gt As Vance writes Ive seen far too many people awash in genuine desire to change only to lose their mettle when they realized just how difficult change actually is.gtOh the working class and their aversion to difficulty.This quoted passage by the way doesnt even directly speak about the working class. Here it is more fullygt  On our particular mission senior marines met with local school officials while the rest of us provided security or hung out with the schoolkids playing soccer and passing out candy and school supplies. One very shy boy approached me and held out his hand. When I gave him a small eraser his face briefly lit up with joy before he ran away to his family holding his twocent prize aloft in triumph. I have never seen such excitement on a childs face.gtI dont believe in epiphanies. I dont believe in transformative moments as transformation is harder than a moment. Ive seen far too many people awash in a genuine desire to change only to lose their mettle when they realized just how difficult change actually is. But that moment with that boy was pretty close for me. For my entire life Id harbored resentment at the world. I was mad at my mother and father mad that I rode the bus to school while other kids caught rides with friends mad that my clothes didnt come from Abercrombie mad that my grandfather died mad that we lived in a small house. That resentment didnt vanish in an instant but as I stood and surveyed the mass of children of a wartorn nation their school without running water and the overjoyed boy I began to appreciate how lucky I was born in the greatest country on earth every modern convenience at my fingertips supported by two loving hillbillies and part of a family that for all its quirks loved me unconditionally. At that moment I resolved to be the type of man who would smile when someone gave him an eraser. I havent quite made it there but without that day in Iraq I wouldnt be trying.I mean I guess we could assume thats what hes talking about but rereading that passage I find little to take offense at. Like I said theres certainly great discussion to be had about his book and arguments to be made for and against it.

This led to some intensely difficult to read sections and even whole books.My other problem with this series is that because there were so many narratives trying to tie them all off in  ending is virtually impossible. Think of it like a really thick pencil all the shavings of wood are the narratives and you are trying to shape it into the tip ending. Some of the narratives seemed extremely rushed and it wasnt sandersons fault. Overall it was worth reading for me because there are some exceptional parts where you just cant put the book down.

I did not say to stop to take the medicine. I didnt claim that it would work for everybody. I did not know if you had tried hard as me. And if someone read my comment and gets motivated to do so and gets out the depression he should thank me. The more people give good advice the better.The problem with you is that you dont accept that your comment was selfish and demotivational. Just apologize. It is fine. You dont need to win every argument everytime.The pharmaceutical industry gets billions of dollars with unnecessary antidepressants every month. There are many articles about that.

11260355,0,t3_60n0gw,I dont take much stock in them. I have a terrible time rating books myself. For example I have been trying to branch out the genres I read so in February I read a bunch of highly rated romance novels from goodreads. My expectations were low since its not a genre I typically explore so the few I actually read past the sample and enjoyed Id probably want to rate four stars. But in the overall view of ALL the books Ive read in every genrewell then they dont rate anywhere near four stars on that scale. That said I think I tend to rate everything highly because of that. Any book I completed gets  stars from me. Quite enjoyed it four. Will read it again five stars. Howeverdoes that mean I think the  star books are QUALITY? God no. Some of them are pure guilty pleasureentertainment books and cannot be compared to other books that I think rate five stars in terms of value and quality...Ahhh rating books is impossible.,books,df8cev7,1,t5_2qh4i

The fact that people find them entertaining does not make them high quality art. And my point isnt that people shouldnt try Gaiman because they might like him. By all means. I was responding to a claim that everyone will actually like at least one Neil Gaiman book. Thats ridiculous. Edit People should definitely read whatever they like.

Ill make sure that never happens again. she decides to learn everything she needs to know to be the new witch for her town. throw in some drunken demented fighting smurfs and simmer to taste.

The rightful heir to the throne is only a babe so they hide him in plain sight  with a band of troopers so he can learn to be a king on the stage. Time travel hijinks and discussions on the influence of fiction and reality on each other make it packed with great bits.I also like his endings. Douglas Adams could spin a great joke but he had trouble connecting them into coherent plotlines at least in HHGTTG. I love the man but to me Terry is the next door neighbor of Adams.

Although they are in some ways ideally suited for each other they are always at crossed paths. Whether its circumstances misunderstandings fate or just personality flaws they never quite fit together. Like everything else in the book the South innocence passion family relationships and so on their love is gone with the wind.

Its a similar style of line to the drink that was almost entirely unlike tea.He baits you in like its going to be a vivid description of how they were flying and instead he says they were floating in a manner entirely unlike bricks.Which is no more descriptive than just saying they were floating since bricks dont float at all.

Prometheus brought fire to humans and is largely regarded as a hero for us.  The gods were pissed because Prometheus thus enabled humans to challenge the gods.

Some of his shorter novels like the ones you mentioned feel like theyve been written in one sitting while the author was fully concentrated on the book and didnt falter at all all throughout the writing process. The longer books probably take too much of going back and forth rewriting and restructuring and at some point they feel like King loses his vision doesnt really see where the story naturally leads anymore so he comes up with a solution that is neither here nor there. The endings then feel rushed like he just wanted to get the project finished or somewhat misplaced like that of Under The Dome. ,books,dfixwed,4,t5_2qh4i

You say this could be put together from reports of defectors  indicating that the situations presented are not outlandish. That being so it doesnt matter much who wrote it. Either way its a book of good stories about life as somefewwhatever people experience it in NK but perhaps having lost the juicy smuggling aspect. As someone else said somewhere in your quest for the reasonable view I think you may have gone too far against the Western spin... There are plenty of well documented atrocities and prison camps and so on going by evidence given to the UN and NK is known to eg kidnap people and imprison them to make propaganda videos or teach English or whatever. You also seem to suggest that defectors saying well it wasnt as bad as all that after a while in SK means that it was golden. Isnt it possible that life really sucked as they first described it but also they now miss it and are nostalgic for it? Or that as time goes on they think more on the good times than the bad? It seems to me that the number of reports about life in North Korea cant all be a South Korean conspiracy and UN evidence is pretty likely to be credible.

11441647,0,t1_dfskt88,I dont disagree. I think it was market forces that made them use older names and thats my point.So nothing is saying that the new Iron Man or Thor will be there forever. Literally their have been multiple people holding each mantle for some time until eventually the main comes back in and the galaxy finds balance. The way I saw these moves was to get the character a head start using a widely known label with a known install base and name recognition among even regular noncomic nerds who could be interested in picking up a new book. It was to expand their demos and hopefully find at least one new character who could eventually be a true main in their own right.But comic books are effectively all but dead as the media we grew up with. Kids dont read them much anymore  its more for the kids of yesterdecade and more. So finding new demographics doesnt fucking matter in a budget sense youve got the diehards and a few casuals and then the CBM bandwagon crowd thats it. The diehards will get pissed at any changes to their favorite sacred cows and theyll never be compelled to en masse pick up a new exciting character whose culturally removed from their background. The Casuals dont exist in large enough numbers to justify picking up on a brand new character no one knows about. Some will but nothing meaningful.And the bandwagoners will just wiki the whole thing after they hear about the soon to come Comic Book Movie adaptation  which for a new nobody character that appeals to completely untapped cultural demographic ABC will happen never.,books,dfswewo,2,t5_2qh4i

11478777,0,t3_63ocgp,I cant believe I havent read this yet. Im a huge Bradbury fan and I have a tradition where every October I read Something Wicked This Way Comes From The Dust Returned and Halloween Tree. Not having read this book yet Im waiting for summer I can still identify how his books have similar effects on me as this one did on you. Bradbury has a masterful unique ability to convey more meaning with fewer words than any author Ive ever read. I have a twin brother were both  and once a week we walk around the old neighborhood we grew up in. We like to joke that the spirit of Ray Bradbury lives there and welcomes us every time we go over there because each time we walk down the streets it unlocks an almost overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Bradbury is for us the perfect representation of that effect because of how gifted he was at portraying that aspect wether it be through the lens of childhood lost times forgotten or lost loves. Sorry im rambling a bit but seeing posts like yours reminds me that there are others out there who share an appreciation for Bradbury and not only the stories he tells us but the way in which he tells them.,books,dfx46dg,3,t5_2qh4i
11479252,0,t1_dfwli54,gt There are some recommendations from the Department of Education wrapped up in various programs Reading First comes to mine but I dont believe any of those are required.Where I went to high school the local school board posted a list of preapproved titles for each year and each learning module identity duty free will the American experience and so forth.  Teachers can go off list but theres an approval process.  They have to fill out a form describing the book and why it matters then get signatures from their fellow teachers and submit that to the school board.  It wasnt terribly cumbersome but its enough that you probably dont want to do it twenty times. I should say though that the preapproved list was pretty broad and in grade  we take English electives for which there scarcely seem to be any rules.  One of my electives was on scifi and fantasy but we also had classes on world literature womens lit subArctic literature sports fiction and nonfiction plays poetry and the Bible. ,books,dfx64es,1,t5_2qh4i

Weird maybe but Im not sure how the word Jew is offensive by itself.  and  references forbidding Muslims following other Muslims not even sure what that means. How is that offensive? Oh you who have believed do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are in fact allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you  then indeed he is one of them. Indeed Allah guides not the wrongdoing people. Okay that one was also weird and I guess mildly offensive? Thats hardly offensive for the Quran.In the end it just doesnt fit with the characters minus the Jew thing. Overall a pretty weird thing to do as a professional comic book artist but in the end its not like he wrote some sort of code like FUCK THE CHRISTIANS AND JEWS.So yeah a mildly offensive maybe? and dumb professional move but not exactly newsworthy.

I much prefer how Cats Cradle and Mother Night denounced war which was by focusing on people on the extremities of war. Everyone knows that war is hell for a soldier. Weve heard that story a million times. But Cats Cradle tells the story of how nuclear weapons could be created by simultaneously genius and naive scientists.

As a former teenage girl I understand being caught up in highschool drama hot or not lists boys grabbing my ass and then telling me to calm down when I got angry little olly olly oxen fuck friend groups not being friends anymore.Why in the literal fuck would you invite some girl you barely know to your house when some random fucking dude is standing outside your window taking photos of you as masturbatory aide?? Why why why why is all I said reading through this part.Okay so Jessica was pissed off that you were on the hot side of the list. Her reaction was stupid as hell that entire scene was High School Drama.Since the people treating you like shit were at these fucking parties you continued to go to what did you expect to happen Hannaaahhhhhhh? Did you think one day they were going to hoist you up like fuckin Hannah man she just keeps coming to parties like Im so glad she keeps coming around  No fucked up shit is going to happen. WHERE THE FUCK were her parents? They are mentioned maybe once because they had a store. I could understand if she couldnt go to them or whatever but nothing was said. I cant remember if Hannah was an only child but  times if youre a girl and an only child your family is super fucking annoying and always in your business. Youre walking somewhere and this gross ass fucking dude and this girl that you dont like are in a hot tub. Yes the best choice was to go to the hot tub and be in your undies. In this scene she was dissociating and that shit is scary as fuck. It took years for me to come to a realization that just being in the sex act that I knew I didnt want to do was talked into doing just wanted it to be over its rape. no cute words around it thats what it was. Having regrets is well shit him and I had sex thats a bummer never doing that again. Not he was fingerblasting me and I just sat there clenching my jaw and being stiff. Thats not an oh darn regretful moment. Thats rape. I think if a rational somewhat normal dude was in that situation he would have stopped. Girls usually are or at least fake being super stoked on having you poke them in the uterus for like  minutes. She wasnt into or faking anything and he continued.THEN can I tell you how many mental health professionals stupid Mr. Porter I work with and have seen in my life that tell me either report or move on because realistically Hannah was not down to hear the realistic options she wanted a person that would listen and she could open up to not options those are your options. You tell the authorities and have that mess in your life or you can do the therapies and groups that you can to handle those emotions and continue living your life.This is really long but Mr Porter should not have just let her leave hes a fucking idiot.,books,dg7si8z,4,t5_2qh4i

11596971,0,t1_dg9v5px,I dont really see where the book would be insulting. Its a tale of a young man who sets out to realise his dream encountering many failures but never gives up or let anything discourage him and in the end gets rewarded for it in an unexpected way. Obviously this is my personal opinion but I saw the main message of the book as to never accept a temporary inconvenience as failure and to never give up regardless of how bad the situation might look like in the moment.

If you want a good classic Poirot theres Murder on the Orient Express though thats almost all dialogue.

11635358,0,t1_dgecik3,I actually think it aged pretty well. In Literature when a story lends itself to be read from different angles and offer new perspectives it can be considered canon. I have read this book many a times and even though I always got very fed up with Holden Caulfield the interesting part about the book lies in the subtext rather than in the literal words on the page. When I was  Holden was a rebellious hero setting off against adults. When I was  he was just trying to be shocking for no apparent reason. The book can be read looking for that shock which hasnt aged well indeed but I thin Holden is just a very hypocritical teenager that merely thinks adults are phonies because he is fed up with his own parents. Similarly you could read it as Holdens processing of the trauma he has from his brothers untimely death. There is also the suggestion that he has been molested many times as a child. I also did a queer reading of the text not too long ago which suggested that Holden is actually a closeted homosexual repressed by his time.But I think the best strategy is not trying to like the character or try to relate to him. I think the fun lies in trying to understand the why.,books,dgevpoq,3,t5_2qh4i

The male professor speaking at the conference mocks Offreds education and questions whether the recording is real or if its fabricated and sensationalized this is further promoting the oppression these women faced during Gilead.

So think more along the lines of the LOTR movies. Im sure many people watched the movies and hen decided to pick up the book. And Im sure many book fans were intrigued to see how the movies would portray the books. I know video games can be more polarizing as in nobody is probably just going to buy a console to play a game if they dont play video games at all.

Its happened with music films and games already and I was hoping with books theyd have learnt that  Some people will never pay for things. Its just the way it is and always has been. Your digital customers just want the convenience of carrying round a single device and are not there to be exploited for financial gain or subjected to the whims of your copyprotection mechanisms which as noted do not work.

It was supposed to be a bit different I decided to read it since Id loved the original novel and Id read plenty of reimaginings of Dracula I loved. That novel was terrible. The first third the author is talking about the life of Bram Stoker which okay thats fine. But for some reason they decided to include a map of castle dracula based on the original novel and Im like....???? Why do I need to know this?When you FINALLY get the novel its amazing! At least.....the first part with lawyer trapped in Draculas castle is. There are new elements introduced and its awesome! Theres a vampire mistress looking about Dracula is more sinister and its just better!And then the last third of the book is just the unfinished authornote version of the book. It sucked.

11794240,0,t1_dgwrr31,I was a very imaginative kid who firmly believed in monsters like Pennywise.  Everything about the book brought back those days when I would jump onto my bed from a few feet away so the monster couldnt grab my feet and every light between my bed and the bathroom had to go on during night time potty breaks to keep the monsters in the shadows away.  I read IT for the first time in my early s and it brought all that terror of childhood right back in and made my rational mind work overtime especially after dark.  Im a adrenaline junkie who loves to read so no way was I going to stop!  I remember ending the book with such a feeling of triumph that the monster was dead that I blew through the last few chapters without much thought.I came back to IT about a decade later when I was in my early s.  Pennywise still scared me but I experienced it more as a fear of all of the terrible evil lurking out there that could hurt my kids that I might not see before it struck.  I really identified with The Losers as adults drawn back into the nightmare who found strength in their bond.  The thing that struck me the most this time was how heartbreaking it was  not only the death but the intense bond fading away like the writing in the address book.  I was left with the feeling that The Losers had been used by the good side and then cheated out of the chance to spend the rest of their lives close to the people who were closest to them.Ive read IT several times since then and its taken me until my s and the death of my parents to really understand what Stephen King was trying to convey  besides a scary read.  Now I can feel the terror and the love that bound the young Losers and I can experience the deeper horror and the strength in their bond that the adult Losers have.  But I can finally understand that even the closest relationships fade and I really get that feeling of wistful sadness that King filled the last few chapters with.IT is really a book that masterfully speaks to people in different ways depending on your age and experience and no movie or even a mini series could ever capture that.Also Im convinced that the people who get caught up over that one bit of the book are really missing out but unfortunately the obsession our current culture has with sex blinds people to everything else  kind of like viewing Michaelangelos David and dwelling on the size of the statues penis.,books,dgwx0s7,67,t5_2qh4i

11795445,0,t1_dgwsf4e,But at some point you might realize that theres a reason Harry doesnt tend to go to adults for help especially in the first several books Harry was an abused child. His guardians were awful and theres never mention of any teacher or neighbor or anyone who recognizes that he needed help even though it cant have been that hard to see that Harry would be dressed in awful clothes and bullied by his cousin. So Harrys used to trying to deal with his problems on his own. Dumbledore can be pretty standoffish or whatever Lupin and Sirius get taken away from him so to speak in book  and the Weasleys tend to treat him like more of a child than hes used to instead of as a young adult. And after so long not getting help from adults is just habit for Harry. Occasionally Ron or Hermione will say they should go to an adult but Harry always dismisses that idea Its actually kind of heartbreaking how much he distrusts adults and how early he learned that he could only rely on himself. ,books,dgx1xz3,267,t5_2qh4i

Its fairly easy to gloss over things like his grief for his brother or the fact that he was molested multiple times due to how passively things are written. But careful reading shows a troubled boy not unlike many of us who is simply looking for reassurance that everything will be okay. Hes seen the darker side of growing up and just like the rest of us he has his fears and longs for the days of childhood innocence.
