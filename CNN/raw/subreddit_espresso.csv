4655737,0,t1_cthegke,This is a false dichotomy. Drip coffee does not equal bad coffee. In fact the average person is going to be much more able to make good drip coffee than good espresso. I drink espresso at home and drip at the office. Both are excellent. But the drip is way more cost effective and way easier than the espresso. Espresso is an expensive hobby and not appropriate for an office environment especially when were talking about tax payer funds buying the machine. This guy is a government leech who wants an incredibly expensive espresso set up but doesnt want to pay for it himself. ,espresso,cthexu8,-1,t5_2rqoi

5544825,0,t3_3r27ck,First you need to ask yourself what your use will be.  How many drinks per day? Milk drinks? Will you ever be entertaining for multiple coffee drinkers? What is your budget? Do you intend to plumb your machine run off a tank or a flojet? Doy uo have a space requirement? Do you want AN SBDU probably not HX or DB?  Just because you know a brand like Gaggia or Rancilio dont get hung up on those names.  There are LOTS of awesome machines for different use levels of all different brands.  Youre about to make a HUGE monetary commitment so research it.Also remember and youll here this again and again spend AT LEAST as much on your grinder and your do on your espresso machine maybe me.  The Grinder is the heart of your setup the machine is just a shiny hot water delivery system.,espresso,cwkdxm8,10,t5_2rqoi

6368607,0,t1_cyx2p5g,I have a amp rotary double boiler machine and the outlet has a watt meter built in.  Average draw is w if you combine heatup and then just maintaining temp over a  hour period.  for a total of cent per hour.  If your boilers are both wrapped with good insulation the power draw is not high the actual time spent heating up to temp is  minutes if I recall correctly.,espresso,czdjhiw,1,t5_2rqoi

10102952,0,t3_5kgkbb,Have you considered going for an aeropress? Its not an espresso machine but it much less expensive than an espresso machine or the required pour over hardware. Put the majority of money in the grinder.  Get a used one locally if possible making sure you can replace the burrs later when they need to be. I used Craigslist quite a bit to find stuff local thus avoiding shipping charges.,espresso,dbofdsc,1,t5_2rqoi
10245140,0,t1_dc57qi5,Have you checked the calibration on your Vario? I used to have the same setup and I dont recall any standout problems with lighter roasts  your grinder and machine are very capable.The Vario should be able to handle anything for espresso purposes. If you are at the finest setting as you mentioned Id check out the Baratza site for info about setting the calibration. The tools to do it come with the machine. ,espresso,dc5cdiq,2,t5_2rqoi
10688936,0,t3_5swtsk,As a milk lover go for the expobar. Being a HX is a huge jump over the single boiler. I had a Silvia for  years. While it can make great espresso it isnt near as fast as a good HX. With the Silvia youll have to wait for it to reach streaming temperature after pulling your shots whereas you can do both with the HX.,espresso,ddihgr7,3,t5_2rqoi

11397510,0,t3_62ei1i,Are you talking strictly french press or drip too?If youre only doing french press a Grindmaster Fuji Royal certain Kalita grinders and a couple other rarities with Ghost Tooth style burrs would be the absolute best. Better than an EK even at that level of coarseness.If you want to do drip too Lido or similar is actually very fast and easy. Unless youre regularly grinding mass quantities for batch coldbrew youll be fine. Back before I had my Bunnzilla it wasnt any trouble at all hand grinding g for my woodneck.,espresso,dfnw5c0,2,t5_2rqoi
