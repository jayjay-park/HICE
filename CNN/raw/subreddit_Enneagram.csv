3475506,0,t1_cpnxdj0,gt  the main thing that drew me to this conclusion is that you would read something you dont want to in order to better yourself. that makes me think of s image consciousness and striving to be seen as successful. This is what I thought as well but its actually a bit more complicated than that. If we look at my Jungian personality type INFP one of my motivations becomes more clear. When I said better myself I should have been more specific. INFPs are often said to have a crusading side to them I do. I have a very vague and idealistic set of goals which include A. Eliminating Capitalism and B. Making sure every human has the means to live with dignity and in harmony with others. So when I say bettering myself what Im really talking about is making myself more capable of defending those principles and knowledgeable enough to articulate those principles to others. So It is certainly the case that I care whether other people believe I am competent but its based not in selfinterest rather it is based on the desire to defend and spread my ideas. These ideas are very much tied to my ego and I can be quite aggressive about them. Im not sure just how  that would be.gtridiculously difficult to open my mouth first when around someone i dont know well.This is somewhat the case with me. I have to size people up before I allow my humor to let loose. I have a crude and dark sense of humor so I have to make sure that the person isnt an uptight asshole before I let them have it. When I am around uptight assholes I can be quite shy and reserved. I find that most people are receptive to my humor so in general most people find me extroverted.,Enneagram,cpoflxd,1,t5_2sdjj

4598692,0,t3_2xrj5d,As a w myself I understand your fury completely. People are shitty the world is organized in such a way that dishonesty and a lack of morality directly correlates to success and the achievement of goals and people like you and me who value truth above all else are still held back by the lowest common denominators of our society and will be nothing more than unnoticed background noise always fighting an uphill battle. Emblems of goodness always seem to be the exact opposite of actual goodness and so those who are actually good are rendered invisible in the shadow of those who deceptively pretend.Nothings ever going to change. Short of a brilliant stroke of luck our upstanding morality and genuine characters will never translate to real world successes. Remember though whats most important to youtruth. Not success or imposed morality or punishment although I understand the burning desire for justice too but thats a different topic entirely and ultimately leads to the same conclusion Im getting at anyway or any of that. You can only control yourself but you can do so in an amazing way. Be forthright and honest and vigilant and everything good. It will affect some other people. It wont affect others. Still you have complete power over how you act even in the face of the bullshit of lesser people. Its a huge struggle and thats the fun of it. Youve been placed in a shitty world and its making you angry but the real challenge is not to let any of that seep inside of you. Dont let it break you dont lose your goodness because its a rare and valuable thing even if no one else notices. Over an extended period of time too it will actually influence some things and some people for the better if you are able to retain it and not lose your light in a cloud of anger or let it boil over into hate. Everything affects everything but every change is slow to take hold and requires perseverance and taking a few blows. Still its like the proverbial inner city teacher whose class doesnt give a shit but eventually affects one student and suddenly it was all worthwhile.

8939533,0,t1_d7m35m3,gt As a note Im not actively trying to type you.Well darn.  P  Do give me any insights though if you reach them please?  Id like to know what youre thinking.gt Do you tend to assume people are trying to paint you as wrong or stupid when they question you?I assume this more often than its actually the case  that is to say there are more false positives than false negatives.   Its not every time but it is quite often.gt Or is there something that distinguishes questioning from feeling personally attacked?Of course if someone is being openly hostile that makes a difference.  But there are other factors too.  Being asked about my opinion on something whether its good or bad  even being somewhat rudely confronted about an opinion I have  doesnt phase me.  Being questioned about a personal choice e.g. getting a piercing quitting my job etc. doesnt phase me.  Being questioned about my interpretation of someone elses behavior is still relatively safe territory.  But being questioned about a professional or academic choice or especially being questioned about a statement Ive presented as fact can get a little rough for me.There are definitely more and less threatening ways to do it.  Im not sure that I know exactly what they are though .  My boyfriend and I actually met because he was to my mind relentlessly questioning my typology theories.  I was definitely really mad at first but he stayed really calm and he seemed really interested in trying to understand where I was coming from.  Even though he ended up being almost entirely right I guess the fact that he seemed calm and interested and eliciting rather than forceful and correcting and declarative is the biggest factor that let me engage with that more comfortably.gt Is it related more to how people phrase things or what theyre questioning? For example questioning your character versus questioning something you assert to know some third party information or fact.I answered this a bit already but  questioning my character only bothers me in very specific circumstances things that I already feel insecure about.  The vast majority of the time once somebody starts making personal attacks my defensiveness and anger and hurt quickly diminish because I have a pretty strong awareness of my own intentions and character traits.  If someone called me controlling pushy nosy whiny or lazy I would just laugh and shrug because I know those things are true and theyre very unlikely to change much.  If they called me rude mean stupid discriminatory a doormat or something like that I would laugh and roll my eyes because I know theyre not.  The gray area are things I worry about sometimes and am working on  things like being manipulative attentionseeking reckless impatient or emotional.  But even in those cases it might give me pause or even sting a bit but its unlikely to get me super riled up.But yes questioning something I assert to know can really make me mad.  And I think how its phrased makes a difference.  Now that I think about it it goes back to those two extremes  if someone seems very unsure Oh...I learned that it was xyz is it not that? I feel excited and happy to help.  If someone seems very sure very confident and calm I see what youre saying.  One thing you should keep in mind is that... I generally take it quite well.  Its the parts in the middle  where someone presents something as fact but the way theyre acting doesnt match my perception of how a confident and knowledgeable person presents their information.  For example people being defensive and critical when presenting a piece of information means that they are not entirely confident in it.  Exceptions are given of course when someone is repeatedly hounded or pestered or ignored but in general the majority of people dont get mad or attack simply from reading or hearing something incorrect.  So any time someone seems annoyed or mad at me for a statement Ive made that they disagree with my instinct is to assume that theyre not entirely confident in their own point of view and the more aggressive or reactive they are the more firmly I hold that belief.  And when someone who is not an authority on an issue pretends to be or expects me to see them as one thats what draws my emotions to the surface very quickly.  Unfortunately as I said there are a lot of false positives  times I think someone is being rude or reactive when they werent intending to.  Almost never do I make the opposite mistake though thinking someones knowledgeable and trustworthy when they arent.  I guess Ive subconsciously decided that the latter would be a much worse outcome and Im willing to risk some of the former to avoid it.Oh dear this is getting long.  I hope you dont mind!gt So its difficult for you to exactly pinpoint what makes you uncomfortable? As in you have the pieces but not the whole picture in crystal high definition?Well yes  analyzing the reasons for my behavior or the root of my feelings is always difficult for me.  Im really interested in it but it relies heavily on guesswork and intuition as I have a nearly nonexistent episodic memory  Im prone to making the same mistakes over and over again and not noticing at all.  Being directly questioned about why I do something is a nice break from my everyday life and gives me a chance to reflect on my personality.  But none of this stuff is preformed Im thinking about and discovering it as I go.gt What qualifies as arguing? And what do you see as asserting superiority?I mentioned this before the answer to the latter question  when someone insists that their proclamations are right and that I should accept them I see that as asserting authority.  Authority of this sort must be earned though in my mind  either through strength of character someone Ive known and come to trust as reliable strength of belief related to that calm patient questioning demeanor I referenced before andor strength of argument providing irrefutable evidence and explanation for their point of view.  Without at least one and preferably two or three of these it doesnt matter how right someone is Im unlikely to even listen to them.  I recognize that thats not considered a positive trait in our society but I really dont think I can help it.  I relate it to role Te.  Its the best method Ive found for navigating the world of facts.As far as arguing  basically anything that contradicts me especially in the realm of fact.  This is actually something I struggle a lot with Tidom and aux because they do this constantly with no ill will and yet I still find myself reactive to it.  Its something Im working on.gt Can you give an example of a situation in which the parameters for success were unknown in a given situation?For example here  how do you know whether or not youve been typed into the correct enneagram?  All you have to go on is your own and others interpretations of a multitude of different sources which may be more or less valued by more or fewer individuals in the community but there is no one right source with one right method of typing or verifying that typing.  So arguing against people with really strong opinions in this arena is...its really useless imo.  Present your opinions present your experience but theres really very little authority anyone can assert here so any attempts to do so I see as very odious and having to struggle against that GREATLY reduces my enjoyment and interest in exploring the ideas of the theory.gt  it seems like you like being in uncomfortable situations when you CHOOSE them.This is very very accurate.  The caveat being that it can also be when someone I trust chooses them but in a sense thats my choice as well  voluntarily giving up control temporarily.gt Holds you back from what?From doing the things I want to do from saying the things I want to say from feeling the way I want to feel...from manifesting my ideal life.gt Out of curiosity do you anticipate these demons before they fully manifest? Or do they spring upon you without any foresight on your part?Hmmm...thats an interesting question.  I would say neither.  I dont anticipate them in that I dont attempt to predict or search for them but neither do they spring on me in the sense that I am rarely surprised or taken off guard when they arise.  It relates to what I said earlier about my poor episodic memory  my life is composed of patterns most of which I am not consciously aware of but which of course some part of me must notice.  Unhealthy patterns tend to grow and develop over time and when unchecked they usually increase in frequency and intensity until at some point an awareness of these unhealthy patterns or tendencies begins to creep into my conscious mind.  As soon as this awareness becomes strong enough to be clearly true and not just a figment of my imagination thats when I attempt to selfcorrect.,Enneagram,d7meelh,1,t5_2sdjj

I cant decide between  and  and when I reach out to the community people seem to say  and  with equal certainty not to mention all the other types that get thrown in PI relate to the feeling of nameless anxiety but really not to the feeling of paranoia or being overly suspicious of people. I may sometimes be quick to assume peoples motivations or emotional state but its very moment to moment for me.Like if someone speaks to me sharply I may immediately assume some things about them but I wouldnt typically give a lot of weight to those impressions or store them for later use. Ive pretty much never found paranoia to be a useful tool. I actively try to avoid reading too much into things. I pretty much assume that people arent expressing themselves clearly enough I know I never am that they dont fully know what they truly think either. So I shouldnt put too much weight into the individual things that people say. I trust my overall impression of a person and avoid falling into the rabbit hole with little details.Does this still resonate with you? I feel like I use my INFJ tools to trust people instead of to distrust them which seems to be the norm. ,Enneagram,db5d6jr,1,t5_2sdjj

10121688,0,t1_dbqrdft,I was just asking to get more of an idea of how the systems work in terms of patterns and real life. The bits about relying on myself and confrontation are true cant rely on others not because theyre unreliable its just not fair to do so and they wont always help ya out. As for not halfassing anything Im told I go full force in things that I only have one speed GO.As for stressful situations... surprisingly chill. The biggest sources of stress I see are never the task at hand or whether or not I can handle it its usually keepin the peeps around me calm because some of them cant handle it as well as I can. I dont let it get to me because that clouds my judgment and reacting emotionally and out of stress is a surefire way to do something you regret or dont intend to do.,Enneagram,dbqv2x7,3,t5_2sdjj
10174465,0,t1_dbwo7gb,Id make a decision to exit a relationship because it does not fit my values or meet my needs. It would not be about how shitty they are or a betrayal of anything. It would be my decision to meet my needs with a strategy that does not include them as my romantic partner. That or it would be a conversation about what needs they are meeting when they behave in a way that stimulates pain for me and if there is another way to meet those needs that works for both of us. As soon as I judge their behavior as shitty and try to take the moral high ground the relationship becomes about shame and blame instead of collabrative learning and growing. ,Enneagram,dbxbyf9,2,t5_2sdjj
10208836,0,t3_5m5zb3,I love this idea!!! Type  Yikes! Whenever something comically tragic happens. This has been... pause educational. My way of casually diffusing an unexpectedly tense situation. Ooh also when I screw up in a predictable way I often jokingly say I know what youre thinking and I dont want to hear it.  Now that I think about it I do have a lot of witticisms for getting out of uncomfortable situations. Thats probably not coincidental to my enneatype. ,Enneagram,dc188g5,2,t5_2sdjj

11554697,0,t3_64jvh8,E and  relationships can be a bit problematic yeah. s not only want to help but its vital to their self image sometimes to such a degree that their desire to help might be ingenuine at its core or theyre very pushy about it moving to . s pride their knowledge above all else because its their main tool for coping with the world. Being told its not enough will not come across well much like a  being told that their need to give has selfish roots or a  being told theyre not fun. Its their weak spot.You need to understand yourself as well as others to be able to communicate and cooperate. Is the way you approach her aggressive? Are you sure he only interprets it as such? s are one of the least introspective types so get over the whole but I just want to help bit and think about why and if your input is really needed. Ask your partner to do the same. Ask him do you want my help?Dont suggest things in a dictative manner s are very independent and can and will slam doors when you try and tell them what to do. Present ideas instead of lists of things that need to be done also can work great. Another thing Ive noticed about s is also that they often respond a lot better to written than verbal communication. Send him texts or post its for lists of tasks or ideas you have. ,Enneagram,dg5q8th,2,t5_2sdjj
