2943068,0,t3_2tvafo,Currently a rail line connects the main base to three desert temples and a village.Near the base are dedicated storage buildings for polished variants of andesite granite and diorite directly to its west and a cluster of four buildings each housing cobblestone sandstone dirt and sand.I guess the next two buildings Ill erect alongside the boulevard that Im creating will be the food storage and the armory.  I dont have much in the variety or supply count as far as food goes but at least theyll give me something to work towards.  As for armory Ill need to do something with whats going to be useless loot drops now that I have fully enchanted diamond armor.  I dont have enough nether brick to warrant a nether supplies storage as of yet.  So I guess the two buildings Ill erect after that will be for...seeds and gravelflint I guess.  And Im thinking across the street from the sandstone and cobblestone buildings will be a small smelting factory with glass and smoothstone storage buildings on either side of it yeah?  Got plenty of lava down below my base and in the nether to make em run for perpetuity.  Then we can worry about where to place the buildings for zombie flesh spider eyes and string and creeper gunpowder.Only got two ender pearls right now so the hunt for a stronghold is still off in the distant future.  Via the nether there are two more villages walled off as well as the possibility of even two more still unexplored.Hooray for video game!,recyclebin,co2n1tr,3,t5_32keo
