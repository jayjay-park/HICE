2473510,0,t1_cmheh6u,Im sorry you were burnt financially and cosmetically. Sadly I waited for a Sunday to shop around. They were all closed which is odd to me because coming from the marine corps Sunday was the biggest haircut day around. I checked out Rayz website from moline and it looks interesting but I dont know if its my style. I grew up in Knoxville and had an old man named Jim cut my hair once a month and I want to recapture that nostalgic feeling as sappy as it sounds. I also dont feel confident enough to shape my beard myself and want a professional to do it. If I wanted a dumbass logo shaved into my head I think Id have plenty of options. I think Ill swing by the hotel Blackhawk tomorrow as I saw there was a shop there a few brunches ago.,QuadCities,cmhfbht,1,t5_2rej0

2588620,0,t1_cmw01a5,Plenty of houses and apartments for rent. Newly renovated apartments in the downtown areas are really really nice but very expensive for the area. Other than that theyre mostly reasonably priced. Houses are cheaper in this area than many other areas of the country but utilities can run a little high in the winter time. ,QuadCities,cmwgx5a,2,t5_2rej0
