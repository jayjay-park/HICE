107373,0,t3_1vb5aw,gt. As I learned songs I noticed patterns and I started to question what was so great about VocaloidAnd then follow that up with gt I do hate the Japanese music industry to a certain extent just like I hate the Western music industry because both of these industries rely mostly on producing mainstream tasteless pop music I really think these two points are at odds.Vocoloid could be the worst thing to happen to the music industry.gtJapanese also have a seemingly healthier system. Artists release a shitload of singles quite frequently. They do tieups with TV shows to keep people aware of their existence.For me this is one of the many things that is wrong with Jpop. They pump out crap nonstop and they are never off the television.gt Whereas Westerners dont have much. You like a bandartists? Wait  months for a single and  years for an album If you want music that isnt tasteless pop you are going to have to give bands some time to put some decent tracks together.,japanesemusic,ceqnml2,1,t5_2scyj

10666535,0,t1_ddg5k03,Theyre one of my favourite Japanese bands and probably one of my all time favourite bands.

11047008,0,t3_5xn6mf,Theres a subculture of groupies in the JRock scene. We call them bangya band girls.Some of them become tsunagari to the bandmen meaning theyve connected with them in some way. Have their phone numbers direct contact to them on social media etc.And then there are the mitsu. Mitsukanojo honey girls are responsible for directly depositing money into band members accounts. A lot of times theyre having sex with the band members as well in return for the money. Whenever you see leaked photos either purikura nudes or whatever its usually a spurned or pissed off mitsu. Band members may have as many as  mitsu at any given time. This is much more popular in the indie scene but big names like Gackt and the idol Tanaka Koki have been outed by mitsu in the past.You can find all kinds of fun stories about band men their sexual preferences and a list of all the STD band men on chs Tanuki board where these fans post.,japanesemusic,dek5qss,6,t5_2scyj
11177095,0,t3_5zgq28,Ive got to second Kinoko Teikoku. Such a good band. Their earlier material is less poppy than their newer stuff imo.If you like Kinoko Teikoku be sure to check out Hitsuji Bungaku.I just recently got into Midori. Theyre uh... eccentric if youre in to that. Ling Tosite Sigure is an awesome band that has dual malefemale vocals though this song is just the female vocals.Otoboke Beaver is a lot of fun.Maison book girl is an idol group with interesting if somewhat poppy instrumentals.Yukueshirezutsurezure are another pretty cool idol group.Dots are an idol group with shoegaze instrumental.EDIT Cant believe I forgot Regal Lily.,japanesemusic,deywt79,2,t5_2scyj
