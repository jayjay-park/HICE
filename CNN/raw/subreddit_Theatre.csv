254170,0,t3_1x017j,I was in a production of Romeo amp Juliet fight choreographed by the brilliant David Doersch. I was playing Romeo. The stage was raked up to mid stage where an eight foot high wall was topped with a platform. During the Romeo Tybalt fight David had Tybalt roll off the upper platform and down the length of the stage stopping short of the pit. I was then asked to sprint and leap off the platform attacking overhead with my eppe on Tybalts head. With my legs tucked up underneath me at the height of my arc I was perhaps  feet off the ground. Terrifying but somehow never got injured doing it.,Theatre,cf73l93,5,t5_2quc9

This can be used to find your range some nuance  common sense might be needed to work out things like which octave it is but as long as you know what notes they are most people will be able to tell what you meanIf you want you can also learn how to read bass and treble clef. This will always be useful for learning notes etc and its not too hard. Im sure theres resources available online.As far as bass vs tenor or whatever other vocal part I am assuming youre male because tenor is the part you mentioned? I grew up in a musical family and I have a hard time distinguishing which is which. Its more complicated than you might think but usually people just want to know your range. If you find your range is like B  F or something similar say youre a tenor but if its more like G  D then say youre a baritone  bass. As long as youre honest about how little you know and know you have a comparatively highlow voice youre fine.EDIT I probably should have mentioned that this can all be fasttracked by getting a couple of singing lessons.

If character is not the issue and straight line learning is you may want to try just breaking down the script into beats. Each beat deals with one idea. Work out your intention for each line what you actually want not what you say and learn the intentions not the lines.Once youve done this youve got a scaffold to work off. The shape of the scene is there. After this the actual lines start falling into place more naturally.Youll still need to run your book for sure but knowing where you have to take the dialogue even if you cant remember the exact phrasing will make rehearsals and wrote learning quite a bit easier.,Theatre,cuxlmk9,2,t5_2quc9

But most importantly ClaudeMichel Schonberg the guy who wrote Les Mis and Miss Saigon also recently wrote a fulllength ballet called Wuthering Heights.

8162245,0,t3_4r0o6v,I would definitely take the gap year or more.  If theater is what you want to do no one really cares about your degree its if you look the part and can play the part also sing or dance the part I suggest taking community college classes in the interim you can knock out all your Gen. Ed. courses and then when youre ready transfer to a better college with only a year or two left and only focusing on your major.  Which I would highly recommend double majoring in theater and some completely different field of study.  Also I would encourage you to avoid a conservatory unless you get into a really amazing one like Ivy League or NYU.  Conservatories wont really teach you anything about the theater history directing design or any technical aspects of skills.  Which is actually a useful and more likely lucrative skill set than any performance skill you can learn.  Conservatories only teach performance skills which is important and there are good schoolsPlease if nothing else do yourself a favor and avoid AMDA but I would research the school heavily before enrolling.  Student debt is a serious issue and is not made any easier by pursuing acting as a career.  Most of the paid work is in regional theater particularly Summerstock you can book them through Straw Hats SETC NETC UPTA.  It pays to be in NYC or Chicago for theater.  If you want to do film or TV LA is the place to be and has a lot more work than either city.  If youre funny improv schools arent a bad way to go.  In Chicago go to Second City in New York try UCB and in LA try Groundlings or UCB.  If film or tv is what you want and booking these roles helps you book theater roles Other good cities to consider are Boston Atlanta New Orleans.

Thats whats been helping me.ALSO!!! Stay in the moment disregard everything and suspend your disbelief put all energy you have in to your work  nothing else. You will then put all of this anxious energy in to something and then the idea of success will move on its own. Your mindset changes so frequently dont believe youre stuck thinking this about yourself forever. Just have faith that youll one day gain the confidence to move forward  believe me its more likely than not to happen the only thing we cant do is force when that will happen.

For those of you who dont know this is a show where a major plot point are power outages that are occurring at the house. Any way after two power outages we are pretty close to the end of the show. Then the lights actually go out. There was a storm outside and everyone on stage figured out what happened pretty quickly. A friend of mine adlibbed a little until some thing even worse happened. Someone on tech panicked because they thought someon hit the pad. Trying to fix this they hit the pad. When we regained power all the lights were still off so  another techie hit the pad. Cue all the lights including those in the house turning on. As someone new to acting being able to see every face in the audience terrified me.

9640219,0,t3_5d1rtc,Lets reverse this for a second.  The lighting designer comes to you and says Hey I have some cues for your choreography.  You have them exiting stage right and I need them to exit stage left because of this lighting effect I want to do.  Also I dont know what you were planning here but I need everyone in this scene to be at waist level or lower because I want to project something behind them.  Now imagine him coming to you the week going into tech.  As a director I would appreciate your input about things like you mention above but you clearly overstepped your bounds with the lighting designer here.  Not that there arent LDs out there who would take your  cues which at the most should be suggestions which could be ignored if the LD chose and try and make you happy.  Sounds like thats the kind youve worked with in the past. But youre dealing with a new designer who has great investment in his artistic product at this point and likely isnt going to compromise easily.  Not to mention you did so BEFORE seeing what he would have done with lights and there is an element of a lack of trust in doing so.What do I think is this guys problem?  Sounds like he was passivelyaggressively trying to sidestep your demands.  He should have the confidence to say I appreciate your input but Im not going to compromise my design to accommodate your wishes. That being said its also possible that he does have actually have issues.  Let it go.  Youve spoken with the director about the problem areas as you see them.  It is now up to them.  ,Theatre,da1csyh,1,t5_2quc9

Since this will be the first city on the tour they may have a lot to work out but Id think with a show of this caliber theyd make sure they have it together before they even put it in previews.   Of course since the cast is new its possible that there will be some kinks there too with staging or something.  But in general Id say preview is almost just as good as regular performances plus youll get to brag that you saw it first.    ,Theatre,db4tbll,5,t5_2quc9

10601254,0,t1_dd6uu2y,gt why did you only look to include actors of colour when the script forced your hand?I agree. This indeed is the true problem. Thank you so much for taking diversity seriously as it seems you do.There is no reason Othello must be black. In a truly diverse theater company one that tells stories of people of color by people of color for people of color at least alongside less raceattentive programming if not exclusively a white Othello would not be a problem. The real issue is the lack of diversity broadly. Focusing in white Othello without stating this would be missing the point. ,Theatre,dd9fsgh,1,t5_2quc9

10875796,0,t3_5vf29k,Ive done this show professionally in the past  heres my thoughts. DArque is a straightforward character  he runs an asylum hes a detailoriented businessman hes not a character you want to go adding too much to. Play it straight and serious  hes crooked as fuck but hes not a master criminalsupreme villain  hes a bad dude that is there to help the other bad dudes.I know this is really simplistic  but sometimes the best approach really is to not overdo it youre not going to steal the scene the character is just not written for it. Youve been paid to lock up Maurice  youll do anything for the right price  think about the kind of person that would lock up his own grandmother if the pay was high enough.
