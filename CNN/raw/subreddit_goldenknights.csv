9728795,0,t3_5efeeh,Id love to see a ArizonaLas Vegas rivalry develop. Both teams would benefit from the interesting storylines that might come of it. Really good for building some culture and gives some new hockey fans something to talk about thats easy to understand and digest. ,goldenknights,dacac44,1,t5_3g1qk

11482067,0,t1_dfvkybp,The IOC doesnt want to compensate the NHL for them shutting down mid season. They also dont want the NHL to market footage from the Olympics. It pretty much doesnt incentivize the NHL to send their players. The NHL is the only major sports league that shuts down during the Olympics so their players can go. Bettman is just taking this on with a businessman perspective which is his job. It sucks as a fan but thats the truth. In the end the corrupt IOC doesnt want to budge and Bettman doesnt want to budge hurting the IIHF and us the fans. ,goldenknights,dfxhnfb,0,t5_3g1qk
