805,0,t3_1u3hwe, I made a fairly we received post earlier about making a blog for my Year of Skating in which I will skate and post at least once every day for the entire year. Its up. I know the site is pretty bare right now but it will soon be full of posts. What can I do right off the bat to improve it and is anyone even interested in following this? ,longboarding,ceej3j5,5,t5_2qvgw

6413,0,t1_cef4yjv,I have been racing for awhile and just got the helmet for christmas. Also the reason i was wearing it for freeride was that it was really cold and the helmet is quite warm.I am just getting good at holding out toesides before i could only do s. Today i got atleast a ft toeside without icing out or touching my glove to the ground.For tips i just started going into toeside s a little faster and putting more weight on my front foot. It also helps to lean a lot towards the street. if you ice out the worst thing that will happen is that you will be on your stomach.,longboarding,cef60kv,3,t5_2qvgw

11650,0,t1_cefr2c9,Well there are a few reasons. First REY was created as a fun side project of our main business which is CNC machining. The main business already paid for the equipment and facilities. Second Since we have decades of CNC production manufacturing experience we know how to maximize the machining efficiency. Third since we do all of the design and engineering in house we can design with the manufacturing in mind. For example some minor non functional design details can be very costly to make and yet provide no benefit to the rider. We leave those out as much as possible and try to keep the costs down. Lastly we just felt it was better to keep the price low for our customers. We like you people. ,longboarding,cefrejp,3,t5_2qvgw

92454,0,t1_ceoxy2t,It could be. Long feet really make a difference when theyre hanging off a lip. You could try to look for a flatter board or even some foot pads for the insides of your shoes. Look for Plantar Facisomething in the shoe sole section. Theyre like  bucks and they cover  of the inside of your shoe. As for the board a smaller drop where your feet would go and some truck risers so you dont destroy the edges of your board. If you get the risers you can probably make your board  inches wide. You could also make stops on the edges of your board to keep your feet from slipping off but that would be kinda hard to get your foot back into the crevasse. Some highgrip extra course grip would help you from slipping off if you made it flatter. ,longboarding,ceoyeg9,2,t5_2qvgw

346573,0,t1_cfgockd,I think you should get a drop down or a double drop deck. The trucks are mounted on a higher platform than the platform you stand on making it lower and easier to push on. Definitely go with some paris mm  vs great and carvy while still being great for freeride. It sounds like youre going to do more commute than freeride so I recommend some nice big wheels like the venom cannibals which come in either mm or mm. Since a drop decks allow for a lot of wheel clearance without wheelbite id go with the bigger wheel to help you gain speed and roll over anything that gets in your way. Dont worry about bearings just get zealous. Theyre cheap and arguably better than most  dollar bearings. Besides bearings dont really matter. Instead of dropping a ton of money on bearings use that extra money for upgraded bushings. Hope i helped!,longboarding,cfgovvh,1,t5_2qvgw

It was released a long time ago but now they make boards like the Sportster and Ibach which are not only better for pushing but also freeride and are actually stiff. Decks with wedging and camber are something of the past and the Maestro only confuses those getting into the sport because a lot of noobs I meet seem to think its some freeride board. I dont mean offense to you if you like the board but its really just an enigma in their lineup.

Then one day I thought I could take a turn didnt take it wide enough clipped the curb and my feet got tangled in some weeds as I tried running it off tripped and slid head first into the trunk of a tree. Blacked out for  seconds and woke up to one person standing over me asking if I was alright and another person pulling over to check one. I got right back up said I was fine and kept riding. When I was cruising over to my friends house I stopped at my local skate shop and had them order me a helmet. I wear it every time I leave my house now! Same with gloves... I always have them on!As for pads... If I get too sweaty and itchy with them on I take em off. I dont really need anything other than gloves and a helmet though.... That keeps me safe enough. Even though it wouldve been smart to have them on during another crash I had last summer and Im still healing from my elbow scar Im fine with out them. Theyre not a must but its smart to have them if you want to protect yourself. I personally dont mind getting a small scratch or a huge gash on my leg or arms every now and then.I guess my point here is if someone wants to protect themselves they will. If not they will have that one fall that brings them the realization that safety is more important. ,longboarding,cfvzqra,1,t5_2qvgw

I know that my board comes with a mm and a a wheel but I feel like if I get better wheels I will be able to handle my street better. I just plan on cruising around and not doing tricks anytime soon. Thank you.,longboarding,cg00ot6,1,t5_2qvgw

562569,0,t1_cg46ch6,Exactly! He is essentially standing on a tight rope. I havent done a lot of down hill but when Im going fast I have my weight on my left heel and right toes. My left foot is angled and my right foot is straight but is on the right side of the board so my base is wider and its easier to balance. I then steer left with my left foot and right with my right foot. If Im going in for a slide I turn my upper body sideways and turn my feet so they are in they are lined up on the board in the perfect position for breaking traction. This might not work for everyone but it works well for me.,longboarding,cg47xiw,1,t5_2qvgw

664094,0,t1_cgfqrzq,It could be a combination of a few of these things Firstly what kind of shoes do you ride in? If you are using skate shoes that isnt ideal because skate shoes do not offer any kind of support what so ever the only benefit to them are that they offer good board feel. If your shoes are not providing an adequate amount of support and cushioning then your feet and back will suffer because all of that strain and pounding from the road will go up through your feet and into your back. If you are commonly pushing long distances I would recommend using a pair of shoes that offer more support like an old pair of running shoes. However if you are really set on using skate shoes I would recommend getting a pair of Super Feet insoles I use them in all my athletic footwear and they are amazing. Having a pair of insoles will provide you with more support and cushioning which will make a world of difference.Secondly if you think your pushing technique is at fault try a heel to toe pushing style over the common pushing style which just utilizes the toes and the balls of the feet. This change in style will lead to less impact on your feet and spinal cord and is much more efficient.Finally if you think your gear is at fault a board with a little more flex will absorb some road vibrations and a pair of wheels with a higher rebound will do this as well.Overall by improving your technique and gear a little these problems should go away allowing you to skate longer and farther and improving your overall health. Sorry for the long response but I hope this helped and good luck!,longboarding,cgfr9aw,3,t5_2qvgw

Id get it from elsewhere but they seem to be out of stock in every big European site along with edgeboardshop.Im thinking about the Comet Ethos now which was a close competitor but Im not sure about the length. At first I was thinking  seeing as its the same size as my Drop Carve but then I took into consideration that my stance on my board isnt that wide seeing as its dropthrough. Maybe the  would be better. The wheel base would probably get a little smaller but Id imagine that would be better for breaking slides.Any advice?,longboarding,ch00jby,6,t5_2qvgw

Make sure the Pivot cup faces out same orientation the trucks are now. You may want to get risers shock pads if you go that route and make sure you get the holes drilled nice and straight.Heres a thread that visually explains what Im saying Also youll probably want to look into getting some different bushings since my guess is that the ones one there now are solid pieces of hard plastic. You can get some for fairly cheap though you may have to shrink them down a bit sand off some from the top or bottom to get them to fit on your trucks.That all being said funboxdist.com is probably your best bet for quality pricing. Get yoself some wheels likely some bearings if they spin smooth and at least for a little while theres no need and bushings Id recommend Hairy Bushings from Ebay or Amazon.,longboarding,ch4sy6z,6,t5_2qvgw

Well one of the officers in this particular town had a certain vendetta against my friend R which eventually led to his eventual and imo wrongful arrest on another occasion. This particular evening though we are stopped and the officer gets out to talk to us.You cant be on this road its dangerous youre being reckless etc. etc.Well R knows all the street laws in this town and begins reciting them along with all the roads that are off limits. Of course the officer becomes angry that someone knows just as much or more than he does so he goes off on another rant which ultimately leads to this little gem...When Im working I dont want to see you guys out here at all. Period.I respond So youre saying its only illegal for us to be out here while youre working?Thats correct.So I asked him if I could get his work schedule he wasnt too happy with that. Realizing his blunder he told us to go home that he didnt want to see us on ANY of the roads including ones that we legally could ride on and walked away fuming.

I was almost there when on a wet spot on the road THE ONLY GODDAMN SPOT MIGHT I ADD suddenly a Porsche speeds out of a driveway without looking and I swerved.  Since the road was wet and I was going really fast and swerving the board slid out from under me and I slid a good  feet before getting offered a ride from the driver of said Porsche.  Its safe to say that  That was the nicest car Ive ever been in and  Im definitely avoiding wet roads forever now.  ,longboarding,cimfrgn,6,t5_2qvgw

1367048,0,t1_cinn35z,A clean edit of someone shredding hard in leathers and a fullface is entertaining and all but the more clips of falling everyone together laughing and admitting that youre human and not trying to appear as this super serious skater makes it cooler to me.  By all means have mph bombing and mph freeride through a sloped city SF style but being humble enough to show your mistakes etc. are always hilarious too sometimes.  Me and my friends are always messing around with stuff like that dude watch me do a kickflip you dont know how to do a kickflip yeah watch board goes flying downhill and he lands on his ass  I guess I dont like taking skating as seriously as most but a big thing for me is having lots of different styles in one video. To me this is entertaining while a  minute raw run of a gnarly mountain is less entertaining because its just tuck predrift tuck predrift.The right music always makes it good but make sure you have the rights so your video isnt taken down.,longboarding,cinncpq,4,t5_2qvgw

1389494,0,t1_ciqfza6,His cast trucks bend because back then all cast trucks bended. Now we have caliber and cronins among others that dont bend.  Classic thane is only good for freeriding because it rolls like a flat tire. To be fair they slide really nicely. Reflex thane drifts choppier than old otangs. We have race wheels these days that you can arguably freeride on because they slide so smoothly. The truck thing and the lack of a urethane formula that can grip and slip well like cannibal thane for example make me not ever want to give him my business. ,longboarding,ciqgdjm,0,t5_2qvgw

I love skateboarding... and yes i am an employee of enertionboards actually i am the ONLY employee... i am the long haired bearded guy in the video amp the designer of the stuff you see in the video...THIS IS NOW MY JOB....otherwise i would probably be working some shit job in retail selling shit i wasnt passionate about.... i made a choice to pursue this and try to make my own money... and i honestly believe in it.... look up the guy who makes the Tesla electric car....its a cool story about making stuff that i guarantee petrol heads wont be fans of... anyway. WHAT DO YOU DO TO EARN COIN  I HOPE YOU HAVE THE SAME PASSION AS YOU DO FOR CRITICALLY ANALYZING REDDIT POSTS.....anyway....i started the business using my credit card and some spare cash i had..i designed all the graphics amp logos for the business myself.... honestly BROs i am just trying to give this a good solid go!.... Quick Sales i promise this is not making me quick sales... I AM NOT RICH....i am the only employee of this business and i am also doing my best to inform people about how to make electric skateboards. I want to be transparent about the reason i posted this video.... it is to show people how to make an electric skateboard... it also is a way to showcase some of the products i designed... buy it or not... the reason i made this video is because i thought it was useful info for people who want to make an electric skateboard.... if you search youtube there is no video available that shows the actual complete assembly of an electric skateboard.... go on check for yourselves.... So believe it or not i was trying to contribute....MY question is to the folks on here.... why are electric skateboards so frowned upon??? you say DOWNSIDES... please lets discuss this topic further...i honestly want to contribute here so give me a chance. I know for sure that one UPSIDE is it can get you to the top of the hill again without walking up it...so lets discuss the topic? OR if youse all want me to FOFF? that fine too. NOW my turn to be critical. boards capable of doing one and only one thing badly if you could please tell me of any one skateboard that is actually good at everything i applaud you.... in fact in the history of skateboard design it has ALWAYS been about purpose built boards.... they always are about doing one thing... you cant kickflip OR ollie a down hill board... and if you race a guy down a hill on a double kick deck when you are on a purpose built downhill board you would quickly realize that skateboards are always built for there single purpose amp they are not much good for anything else.... my boards are built for one purpose... so you dont have to push.... thats it! SO PLEASE LETS DISCUSS,longboarding,ciw5vn5,0,t5_2qvgw

1531408,0,t1_cj88ggk,Im curious to see what youve been working on I dont have the experience nor tools to modify my board in such a way so I like seeing when people do and seeing how they did it for ideas.  You can always post whatever you want in the DGT and nobody can tell you its inappropriate those who frequent this sub sort the DGT by new and its a constant feed of questions discussions and shared accomplishments.  There used to be an issue of the last  hours of a DGT being dead because people say that the top comment already has too many upvotes for their question to get seen so it will get buried etc. and they make text posts to the sub literally saying I know I should post this to the DGT but... etc. but I think the hour rolling cycle has helped put an end to that if you ask it when theres an hour left and dont get a reply post it again in an hour in the new one and people will see it.  There will be changes around here soon. There are MFGs PR people and ProFlow skaters lurking around here now we have k subscribers and imo an easier format to access and moderate than SilverFish and almost a sense of community.,longboarding,cj88lpm,1,t5_2qvgw

1653541,0,t3_2dabnh,First impressions of sleeved cupped washer boardside on  paris trucks It made the trucks a bit less divy and added a more defined center. I had cupped washers on the trucks before so I really didnt feel much in the way of making the trucks slightly more restrictive. All in all I like the changes that the cupped sleeved washer made atleast on paris trucks. Im not sure I would really recommend these washers for trucks that are already restrictive such as caliber and bears. The washers are a pretty big change over normal cupped washers so if you are going to invest in these make sure you are sure that you want to stiffen up your ride a bit! Also I havnt tried these washers roadside but I can imagine that it would be a much more drastic difference.Edit They are a bitch to put on and get off,longboarding,cjnlc19,4,t5_2qvgw

1674807,0,t3_2dk2rt,I have a similar problem. I hurt my knee way back in late  doctors thought maybe partially torn ACL and meniscus. I wore a knee brace constantly for a couple months then quit wearing it because it was fuckin annoying. I had an MRI done on it which showed nothing wrong with my knee so nothing was done about it. For the last twothree years Ive had to be careful how I walk  if I plant my foot and turn my knee will pop and the pain starts. Skip ahead to February  its my birthday and Im at a rave dancing and BOOM my knee piles up on me i was a little messed up so I dont really remember the details. Knee brace and doctors office again he says that it seems to be fine and I just need to take it easy but refers me to a specialist because I insist something is wrong. Its now August my knee is still swollen not much pain unless I tweak it Ive seen the specialist once now and he is going to tap my knee see what fluid I have built up in it and go from there. I hope you get yours checked out because I know how shitty it is to walk on a busted limb. If you get the chance for surgery PLEASE TAKE IT! I am so sick of going to different doctors telling me my knee is fine when it is obviously not.TLDR  busted my knee too doctors jerked me around for years finally getting help hopefully. Good luck!!,longboarding,cjq9s2v,4,t5_2qvgw

1704335,0,t3_2dvg65,Sorry for the long question but I didnt realize help posts are bannedSo Im a rising High School senior and longboarder for almost a year I have one pintail board and I still suck. But I recently wanted to find something a bit smaller and much more maneuverable. I just visited my local skate shop in town that deals with both skateboarding and longboarding its the only one you can find besides Zumiez and I simply felt out of place. I realized I dont smoke drink and I honestly just dont act like a punk i.e. the kids in Odd Future. The people working there didnt seem to care for me but they all acted like the stoners I see in high school. I felt selfconscious of my skill and my lack of knowledge in skating and I mainly didnt want to go back any time soon.Does anyone else struggle with this? Im about to go to college and I want to keep boarding and meet others who do but not if most of the skate crowd is like that. Is this normal and will it be hard to meet longboarders like me?,longboarding,cjtzrtd,1,t5_2qvgw

2078068,0,t1_cl3r19r,I mean it seems like the manufacturer doesnt really trust or respect his audience that much. The how it works page says theyre made with tried and true materials for top quality skateboard trucks but stainless steel axles are pretty much the only material anyone uses polyurethane bushings Bushings not bushes page. are the only material anyone uses  gravity cast aluminum is pretty standard though were seeing a couple better sets of trucks coming out that are cold forged and theres always been the magnesiumaluminum debate on the streetskate end of things. This isnt choosing the best materials for the job this is just going with the default. Anyone who knows their shit about skateboardlongboard parts even to a barelyenthusiast level can look at that and say Well yeah duh. Products marketed actively towards people that buzzwords like polyurethane bushes work on sketch me out. The actual brake system seems like it works fine but I wouldnt be surprised at all if they bend after  months to a year of riding especially under an adult carrying a briefcase with a couple pounds of extra stuff as theyre made of exactly the same things all of the old bent Caliber s Randals and other cast trucks are made of that you see on this subreddit.The concept of longboard brakes isnt lame and poser like many other people on this sub would say. Longboards are a super ecofriendly alternative to cars that can be taken into places that bicycles cant. I know I lived in the city and commuted on one. That being said this specific product seems to me like it preys on dads with too much money and not enough knowledge of the sport and I wouldnt be surprised to see it dead since everyone who actually wantscan afford one will own it before too long. ,longboarding,cl3yulb,2,t5_2qvgw

2336377,0,t3_2m2dx9,Accidentally wrote a review on my Hydro Pro so figured Id share it here.Pretty damn slick. The lightness is awesome makes ollies a breeze even with the mostly flat kicktail. For reference my Hydro complete is significantly lighter than my Royce with just the trucks. Concave is mild but works great I feel really secure on the board even with the mellow stock grip tape. The wheelbase options are crazy  but Ive yet to experiment with anything other than  so far. Ive been a little nervous about thrashing it seeing as how its super thin only three plies of wood but so far its held up great to curbing and such. And dont let the thinness fool you its still as stiff as any  ply topmount. Overall I really enjoy it its got a pretty hefty price tag  but if youve got the cash Id say go for it this board is rad.,longboarding,cm0hm0o,5,t5_2qvgw

2410312,0,t3_2n1s05,UPDATE I rode them for over an hour in the garage.  And in all sincerity what. the. fuck.  They dont ride like a a wheel at all.  They ride like a Street Hawgs but less greasy.  Theyre definitely a you feel it in the roll speed and deformation over bumps but the slide isnt icy in the slightest.  Maybe its because its  degrees F but the wheels drift out with some work and then slide exactly like a pink pencil eraser.  There is more feedback coming out of the Burnouts than I get out of Amber Freerides Butterballs or Cult Classics.  Its like youre not even on wheels but instead your shoes are the things sliding.  Total road unity.  Plus even with the feedback and the grip they kill zero speed another indicator of a.

2832245,0,t1_cnq016k,I get the feeling those complaining assume we are a team of North Koreans who will crush any dissent and reaping some reward somehow.  Were unpaid. I dont know the others reasons for being moderators but this place has connected me with new friends and contacts I feel like I could get on a plane anywhere in the world and there will be someone local who will give me a sofa to sleep on and show me the dope hills to skate. It taught me so much to help me improve my ability in a sport I love and I wanted to keep it in check promote the good vibes and do everything I can to make it improve. I feel like we have something better than Silverfish or those Facebook groups and we have a more restrictive platform to work with.  The new rules arent perfect. There just wasnt a way to make them as fluid as I perceive. I like how now when someone posts a mystery box instead of it being just a picture and the comments being full of what is that? they normally list the contents in the post besides the picture.  Instead of a picture of a new setup against a wall the entire thing is described by the OP.  There are Facebook groups for I just bought a thing give me reassurance and jealousy. I like seeing skating I like seeing modification. If youve done some strange chop or run something unorthadox that is an interesting gear post but another Nessie on cal s with Hoots and Zealous is nothing new or thought provoking. If I see a gear post I want to be interested in why they found that works for them stuff like unusual bushing setups or strange angles on a redrilled something with wheel wells cut in then Im curious how it works.  How suggestions normally work is it is shared in our private channel and we think about how it would play out then we think about what it would take to code any changes and what increase in workload it would mean for us. If we need more opinions we filter it through the IRC then the DGT then make a modpost as a self post to gradually gain more thoughts on it. and somewhere in there we sometimes direct message brandspros if it involves them. When people said they werent informed about the rule changes we had agreement and discussions with around  users if you werent one of them you werent in the right place at the right time to see it. We are open to changing anything if the idea seems popular enough and the implementation is possible and it seems like a good direction for the subreddit to move. ,longboarding,cnq0scm,3,t5_2qvgw

So in that sense text posts youd think should be great and that Id be really happy about the rules.But the problem is text posts dont get very much exposure. So the way youve had to do that if you wanted to get attention was make a picture post then try to put the discussion as a comment but now you cant do that.I dont think youd really object to posts like that either.The problem with the rules is theyre blanket rules. They dont directly attack low effort low value karma grabbing posts specifically. Instead they filter based on whether a board is being stood on or not.,longboarding,cozuf8d,-1,t5_2qvgw

Drop through decks and doubles put a lot of unnecessary force on the baseplates and deck in a way that it has trouble distribution it so it creates more stress.

4048789,0,t1_crhs5xm,Yeah itll be fine. I like softer wheels but you dont really get a good idea of your preferences until you try various things. The idea of big wheels having way more momentum is... dubious. I did some math earlier unless Im really off on rotational momentum bigger wheels only have marginally more momentum irrelevant compared to the boardrider weight. Rolling friction from bearings might be a factor and the amount of bumpiness in the road is another. Both wont really affect you at cruisingdancing speeds.Before you send off your order Id also advise you to pick up a set of bushings  total bushings usually sold in a pair appropriate for your weight maybe a little softer because its for dancing. a range sounds good.

4064222,0,t1_crjiusc,Modifying your setup will usually require some new gear. Twitchiness can be fixed with harder bushings. Do you have TKPs or RKPs on your cruiser? TKPs are much more divey which means that once you start leaning into a turn the easier it is to lean further into it. Pick up harder bushings or get RKPs but you dont want new equipment so Id say just stick with harder bushings since thats a lot cheaper than new trucks. ,longboarding,crjjthg,1,t5_2qvgw

4527985,0,t1_ct1c6yn,I suggest around  as a good size. College life is not high school life. Bags are smaller people dont care as much about stuff and if youve got a board you either stick it under your chair or at the side of the room and itll be fine. A board around  is like a skateboard without the front kick. Nice comfy size for getting around and popping some tricks but not what Id call a comfortable cruiser. Better than a Penny not as good as a slightly bigger and wider board.A wider deck will be more comfortable and give you more grip on the deck and leverage on the board. A longer wheelbase will be more stable at high speeds and better accommodate reverse kingpin RKP trucks which have a more linear turn less twitchiness compared to TKP skateboardstyle trucks. Overall RKPs are better for going quick down hills.Longer board means that you can stand comfortably with your feet still between the wheelstrucks. Beyond that point its just extra length.  should be good even if youre taller. ,longboarding,ct1e13p,2,t5_2qvgw

4535383,0,t1_ct26g04,I dont think this will be an issue for d prints. These objects are solid and not hollow. d prints structural integrity lays upon some things as extruded material quality layers stickiness number of shells and infill ratio.First thing is pretty irrelevant because the most of the people dont use overandoverrecycled material layer stickiness isnt an issue with right temperature settingsrelative to extruding speed because your material is hot enough to melt but not that hot to melt the layer under it it wont be able to do a nice bond. Its someting constantly welding layers together thingy. The last two are a bit problematic. Shells are the outer sides of the object and if there are at least  layer it will be fine. Most important is the infill ratio. It is usually given in  like how many percent are you want to filled with material.  is the fully solid object. I would go with  if you ask me but its need to be try out. D printing is cheap as long as you use  infills instead of  Only thing Im concerned about is the small pulley Im not sure it can handle such a torque directly. Larger pulley will get that indirectly through the timing belt whic is a bit elastic But finding small timing pulley made from metal is not hard. Since the rise of the d printers at least.The braking is solved with the ESC nothing to do with the belt. When you give lesser speed setting to your motor it would slow your movement therefore braking. Also someones say these hobbymotors has regenerating properties.,longboarding,ct2bfhv,1,t5_2qvgw

Assuming your boards are topmount cruisers with sane setups bearings arent trashed wheels arent hard skateboard wheels Id say its  rider skill when it comes to pushing speed. Youre going to start off really slow but once you get used to balancing and can use your armsbody to balance while you push hard its going to be pretty fun.Now its a whole nother story if youre asking about fastest boards for cruising in general. A drop deck is going to be quite a long and heavy board but it will also be much lower to the ground so its less tiring to push.

My a set is at mm now and I can still slam on the brakes with them. Wouldnt call them icy really until you wear them way down below  and pulverize the lips then they get stupid slippery like even more than  thane.

4799028,0,t1_ctzg9sf,yeah bringing your rear leg as far down as possible does two pretty important things it brings most of your weight above your front truck and limits how far your butt can be behind your board. when most of your weight is above your front truck it makes it really easy to control the angle of your slide and when your butt is in the same spot relative to your board you get used to that weight distribution and suddenly you become the fucking bomb at heelsides.,longboarding,ctzgg97,1,t5_2qvgw

Because they offer better leverage on your trucks and downhill is easier on one in my opinion. This is what I would get Earthwing NLS    cals or  Paris trucks wheel have way to many options but check out sugar canes very consistent blood orange Morgans all around wheel or lil hoots super slidy. Personally I think Morgans are the best all around wheel but they dont last that long zealous bearings and of course vicious griptapeI have this set up but with Cronin trucks which are probably my favorite dh truck because it ha lean for daysssss!

4954968,0,t1_cuizcqv,It is destructive to wheels some less so. Id like to see you try to ride down a steep hill and stay in control without sliding some people have to do that as part of their regular riding to and from places. Its an important skill to have. Its really strange to even be discussing it maybe if you tried sliding youd understand. Its such a huge core aspect of the sport so you cant really say stop sliding for fun its wasteful. Longboarding as a means of transportation is just one small aspect of the industry as a whole so its like saying stop racing cars it wastes the gas I want to use to get around. Without sliding wed be stuck back in  tech and DH or racing wouldnt exist as we know it today. Sure if these kids like to drop  on wheels that last a few hours thats ridiculously wasteful but you can buy wheels that last months with regular sliding. Not all wheels are this shitty. ,longboarding,cuj43yq,2,t5_2qvgw

Most of us that stick with longboarding will end up with a number of boards for all the different styles for example.

The main difference between the three boards is their size and wheelbase options. As for wheels why not get some round lip wheels for free riding?

6920172,0,t3_4ageic,TLDR  What bushings should I get for technical sliding on this setup My friend gave me his old skateboard from his teen years.The deck trucks and grip tape were still in very good condition.  No scratches except for a few rusty looking mould kind of stains on the wood and a bit of rust on the hardware.  The deck still felt fresh and snappy for a  year old board and the grip tape felt almost new except for the  years of dust on it.  I guess my friend got the board rode it for a bit and kept it in his cupboard most of the time.I want to try some technical sliding on this board so I made some changes.  Firstly I scrubbbed out the mouldy stains.  It was deep in there so I had to use some heavy duty sink cleaner on it.  It took off some paint with it.  I liked how it looked.  Geve the board character like the pre painted scratches on the Sector  DH ladies series.Added  Independent riser pads slapped on some Hawgs mm and swapped to Franky Renegade bearings from my rollerblading days.  I also replaced the rusting hardware with fresh ones.After putting it together I realized the bushings were creaking like crazy and carvingturning on this board felt weirdly jagged and irregular.  I want to swap the bushings for new ones.What bushings should I get for this setup if I want to use it for technical sliding?  Also is this setup reccomended for technical sliding or should I just use it as a cruiser?  FYI its got Orion skateboard trucks on it.Another pic of the setup.PS It looks like a Tech Deck but I promise you its a real skateboard.PPS I dont want to chop it up or sand off the graphics because the company that made this board has closed down.  So its technically a collctors item now.,longboarding,d10q45d,3,t5_2qvgw

7771991,0,t1_d3plbt8,Totally legitenough setup.  Some notes thoughYou can spend much less on bearings and be just as well off.  Zealous and Cal Bears are like  on muirskate come with spacers and speedrings built in and will do you just as well.That deck should be flexy  which means comfortable and fun to push around but if you get serious into downhill youll probably want to swap it out.  It also has no real kicktails  I like a bit of a kicktail to be able to pop the board up.  Both of these are personal preference issues  youre fine asis but just things to think about.Take the money saved from cheaper bearings and buy bushings designed for your weight.  Venom SHRs will feel very lively which would pair well with your flexy board and notinsane downhill speeds.  Cone  Barrel combo or double barrel combo for your weight would be good.  Cone if you want a more surfy flowy feel double barrel if you want a little more precise feeling.  The double barrel option would need a flat washer for the roadside paris and most trucks come with a cone and thus cupped washer roadsideBut seriously if you just ordered what you posted youre not going to have a bad ride at all.,longboarding,d3pm2io,3,t5_2qvgw

Once this is very comfortable you will have a hell of a lot easier time with foot stopping.

7935117,0,t3_4nvvwb,I dont know I think you simplified things too much. Length does not directly correlate to maneuverability wheelbase does. Pretty important distinction. Like others have said forget about the drag thing or better yet forget about duros all together and just say a is softer than a. Its only important when comparing wheels of the same brand or model.This really seems more like an ad for your products anyways and it works for your decks on your site but the materials thing is not at all universal and you presenting it as such is just gonna mislead new people. ,longboarding,d47zcz6,7,t5_2qvgw

8165124,0,t3_4r01lc,Although you might fit a helmet based on the circumference of your head the shell might not be the same SHAPE as your head. Leading to pressures points which are uncomfortable and wont really go away with a helmet made with EPS foam.Trying on a helmet is really the only way to know if it will fit.Most brands offer their helmet as a dual size shell with different foam padding options to differentiate between the sizes. For example  tripple eight offers a xsmsmall medlrg and lrgxl and depending on the foam padding you insert the helmet will be either of the two sizes offered by the same shell. Then you can play around with the different foam pieces in the front back and sides to get the ideal fit.,longboarding,d4y6tyq,2,t5_2qvgw

You should be learning how to Coleman slide. This video does a great job of explaining how to do a Coleman he covers everything.Secondly youre going to slow. If all youre doing is turning youre going wayyyyy too slow. I know picking up speed is scary especially since you dont know how to stop yet but the only way to learn how to stop is to go fast. Its a catch  I know. Thats why you have your gear though! If you dont already have any Id definitely recommend picking up some knee pads. So youre going to fall when youre going fast but you have your gloves your helmet and hopefully some knee pads. With all that stuff you should be fine when you eat it.

Its a bad habit to pick up especially once you start going faster as that can get dangerous. gt adding more weight to the back allows greater control and eventual hookupThe hookup is controlled by your hips and shoulders not your back foot. If anything your front foot has way more to do with how and when you hookup your back foot is basically just along for the ride and putting pressure on the back rail.

DH boards tend to be much stiffer than cruising boards.They also tend to have not only more aggressive concave but different types of concave. For cruisers its mostly radial concave and maybe occasionally elliptical concave. But with dh boards youve got microdrops wconcave variable concave etc.DH boards also have different truck mounting holes. This lets you adjust your wheelbase giving you the choice between stability and maneuverability.,longboarding,d8nah79,5,t5_2qvgw

Took me about a month to feel  confident in heel side slides took my little brother about  months before he was super confident in it.I highly recommend you start getting comfortable switch  you really limit your freeriding skills if you can only ride in one stance basically can only do speed checks not s. Just in case its not obvious you will probably get bricked riding switch at first so be ready for that.

9613734,0,t1_d9y30jc,Congratulations! Youre the st person to ask this question this month!There are no best wheels. Do what makes you feel comfortable. Round lipped wheels release easier and higher durometers glide across pavement with an icier feel compared to a lower durometer which rips into the pavement. Personally I found focusing more on the muscle memory movements foot positioning hand placement if learning glove down slides rotation speed and confidence helped in comparison to focusing on purchasing that perfect wheel. You will be searching forever for a wheel when in turn you could have learned with what you have. Go faster focus more on what your body is doing and what you want it to be doing and you will be sliding. Also using a hill helps corners and grade all affect your sliding. Do a bit of research around and seriously just type your comment into the search bar and you will realize that this has been asked before. tldr there is no best wheel inb Earthwing slide asP.S. a lot of urethane formulas from each company also affect sliding characteristics good luck.

Look I know its not your fault but for years    Thats all I really had to eat.    We moved quite a bit    Even lived at the church    I spent most of my time hiding     And playing in the dirt.    Ive got childhood terrors that run deep    Nightmares while I sleep.    One day from where I hid    I watched my mom completely fall apart    Lord dont let me lose my kids    God didnt hear her prayers    But I did.    Ill never be able to leave behind    My mom on her knees pleading and crying    While the cops took us away    Ill come get you I promise okay?    I sat in that station watching cartoons    My sister assured me Mom will be here soon    Next day I was in foster care    The day after that they took me away and left my sister there    I attacked and hoped theyd scatter    Instead they gathered    And pulled me away     As my  year old soul completely shattered.    My sister begged me to go    Ill see you soon  I promise little bro.    NO! They already took mom from me!    Theyre not taking you too!    I dont know any of these people!    I just want you!    Theres no language    That can possibly come close    To the lonely empty    Heart stuck in this terrified childs throat.    I dont think those kids saw me as human    Or even animal    They treated ant farms better than me    Except when they dumped them on my face     While I was asleep    Held the door shut so I couldnt     Wash them off    They held my face in an ant pile too    And they would laugh    And I would cough.    Theyd bite in my ears my nose my mouth    Id run into the house    They chased me caught me    Beat me and trapped me like a mouse    But unlike a mousetrap where he dies     When his neck is snapped in two    Mine would be slow    This was nothing new    It was time for round two.    While these kids and their minion ants    Tortured their prey    They locked it in a closet    And left it there to stay.    It must have been at least a day    I know cuz I missed school    And when summer came    And we went to the pool    Little kid me was such a fool.    How could I believe theyd play nice?    This was their game    And I was their sacrifice.    No air in my lungs burned    Water in my lungs burned even worse    If you asked me what hell is like    Id say reread the last verse.    I wasnt frightened    I wasnt scared    But I felt the hate for those kids    To this day I remember     The sky a pretty light blue    Thinking if I live    Im gonna kill you.    Obviously Im here.    And I wish I could tell you it all stopped there.    But this poem is my soul     Laid bare.    Did you know theres a spot right here     Where gunshots and stab wounds arent fatal?    Were at the dinner table    Saying grace    All of us dressed our best    I looked at that kids face    I grabbed that kitchen knife    And put it straight in his chest.    Kinda freaks me out    How I went from being a kid     Saving kittens in a storm drain    To attempting cold blooded murder    On the ones that caused me such pain.    I was in a new home the next day    Seeing a counselor every day    Just hoping Id see my mom or my sister today.    I suppose this aint much of a cultural piece    More of a reflection on the darker parts of our society    And this didnt just happen to me    Its happenin every day on our streets.    Kids hold the future on their shoulders    Potential composers turned to soldiers    Whove lost their composure.    Whats the meaning?    Its impossible to word it    Theres a dark fucking world screaming    And you aint never heard it. ,longboarding,da4geew,3,t5_2qvgw

11196811,0,t3_5zs6hw,I finally figured out why my friend has blown up six different bearings in the past  months. He runs spacers and speed rings but when putting wheels on he leaves about a mm of play in them and takes the shields off to make relubing easier. This guy is doing  ft plus airs and landing them consistently along with sliding his other board and doing freestyledancing type stuff. He says he likes a certain amount of looseness which Im afraid has been influenced by the strange trend of being able to run your board fingertight. He mostly does park and vert but also has gotten into sliding recently so he keeps blowing up the outside bearing. I caught it when he was putting on a spare set of wheels I had bearings in at a sesh. I watched him loosen the axle nut and gave him the best whatexactlyinthefuckareyoudoing face and when he showed me I made him tighten them up because I dont want him wrecking my bearings too.just thought Id share i guess.,longboarding,df158cf,6,t5_2qvgw

11487200,0,t3_63vfll,TLDR The main reason for this post is to find anybody that can give me info to help me find a new board to do tricks on. Im including the backstory for anybody interested. Id prefer a longer type of board rather than one that relates closer to a traditional skateboard for no particular reason.Backstory As Ive recently gotten to college I have been using my longboard more and more often to get around campus and as a way to relax on my free time. I found this subreddit and have seen plenty of videos of longboarders doing mesmerizing tricks with their boards or hitting mph down hills and I am extremely jealous. Being as live in a relatively flat state I dont have much downhill to work with which is why I planned on taking up doing tricks with my board. My board is sort of a pintail design that I cant see myself doing any tricks on given the significant lack of space behind the trucks. Any help is greatly appreciated I love this subreddit and I hope to become a part of the community!,longboarding,dfy2mnk,6,t5_2qvgw

11635017,0,t3_65xypo,I recently got into skateboarding and have come to enjoy just cruising around the most. I currently using a penny board and was thinking about getting a longboard because it seems like the best type of board for what I like. I was wondering if I should start off with some super cheap board to learn or if I should get something of quality. I mainly would like to cruisecarve and maybe get into dancing later on. I am unsure if I should just invest now and how much I should be spending. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.,longboarding,dgeubk2,4,t5_2qvgw

11685853,0,t1_dgki8h2,I dont think findhills is accurate but its definitely accurate enough to determine if a hill goes down or up in which direction and a ballpark of how steep it is. Its DEFINITELY not accurate with things like hairpins. Theres  around here that findhills measures wrong and theyre tighter than findhills shows. Zoom real far in and switch to satellite to really see a curve. But hit the hill you find see how it feels and then youll start getting a good idea of what findhills is giving you,longboarding,dgklxkq,2,t5_2qvgw

Instead of a full puck you can use something simple like heavy cardboard which you can take off once youve got the hang of it and thatll be enough to protect your gloves.Just make sure you put the palm puck low enough thats the most important thing. Youll never keep weight off you fingers if the palm puck is in the center of your hand. The top of the puck should be below your knuckle joint so your fingers can still bend enough to touch your palm.,longboarding,dglry1t,2,t5_2qvgw

11772592,0,t3_67yxcr,Reposting in this thread as recommended. I suck at skateboardinglongboarding but I think I want a Dinghy and Im looking for advice please. I will try to keep this brief.Technically speaking I started skateboarding since I was . I pretty much stopped when I was  or so. Im  now. I was very confident cruising around and enjoyed doing so but never really got the hang of any tricks though I cant really say I tried very hard.At some point in high school I decided that a longboard would be more suitable for me because its smoother faster and more fun for cruising. I picked up a pintail Sector  complete and rode it around a little here and there but never really spent a lot of time with it. The things I liked about it where the smoothness of the ride and the flex and camber which made it really fun and bouncy. What I dislike about it is that its large size makes it inconvenient to take places and yes I know this speaks all to my lack of skill but I find it too fast.  Let me explain.Where I live is quite hilly and as I mentioned my skill level as far as tricks are concerned is zero and that includes sliding. I never really got the hang of proper foot breaking so the only way I could slow downstop was to ride up onto a driveway or onto the grass. Thats not always practical and with traffic it wasnt a very good situation to be in bombing towards moving vehicles unable to safely stop.Yes Im well aware I suck. I dont really care. I was alway used to being able to just step off a skateboard....obviously its not that simple with a longboard. Anyways that brings us to now. Ive picked up my old skateboard again recently and have been feeling like getting back into it. Ive decided that I want something in between a normal trick board and a longboard and I feel like a smallmid size cruiser is the answer. I originally was looking at the penny nickel but Im skeptical of crappy plastic boards and for around the same price can get a Dinghy. So thats what Im eyeing now.To summarize I want a small compact cruiser board to simply use for riding around not tricks. I want it to be smooth and fun to ride and fast enough to be able to ride to places but not to the point that I am going to eat pavement if I just step off to stop. Does a Dinghy fit that description? The issue is that they are hard to find where I live meaning that I will likely have to order one online sight unseen. I dont want to buy one and have it shipped just to find out that its just a smaller slightly less stable but equally fast and hard to control version of my Sector .Any advice would be hugely appreciated.
