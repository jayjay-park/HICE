575147,0,t1_cg5mdgt,The coin is dissipating a large amount of power power is equal to unit of energy per unit of time in the form of heat energy. The power dissipated across the coin which can be thought of as a simple resistor is equal to the square of the current passing through the coin multiplied by the resistance of the coin.    P  I  RIn order to make the coin become red hot the coin must dissipate a lot of power P. The coin is metal therefore the resistance is very low Rltlt. In order to make P large if R is very low then the current I must be large. This is done by providing an appropriate voltage source across the coin. The current passing through the coin is equal to the voltage drop across the coin divide by the resistance of the coin    I  V  RAssuming the resistance of the coin is . ohm the actual value can be found by using a common tool called a digital multimeter. ohm is just the unit to measure resistance like feet is to length or liters is to volume we select a voltage source to provide a large current. If we chose a V car battery    Current  I  V  R    .   ampsWhich is a lot of current amps is the unit to measure current. From this we know how much power is dissipated in our coin    P  I  R    .    .   W  . hp  the equivalent power required to light fourteen  W light bulbs.Knowing the amount of power dissipated across the coin as well as the physical characteristics of the coin shape material etc will allow you to determine the temperature of the coin if the coin is going to melt but that is all thermodynamics so it can be saved for another post.,Damnthatsinteresting,cg5ndbu,7,t5_2xxyj

But most hacked cards happen through hacking a merchant for example a Target or Walmart.  They dont even need a PIN for this.  They hack the card number then do small charges to thousands of accounts. They do this by running all cards as credit even debit cards.  They spend small amounts hoping you wont notice.  Most credit card and debit card companies will take your word for it if it looks suspicious.  You get your funds returned and the merchant is out the dough.  Ive also managed convenience stores and we have to provide a copy of the signed receipt if there is a dispute so make sure you sign your receipts in a legible and unique way.TLDR PIN numbers are not as relevant to card hacking as most people think.  They are really there just to protect the actual possession of the card.  Sketchy family members and friends who might take it from your wallet.Edit I just got off work  wine. ,Damnthatsinteresting,cgke2k6,8,t5_2xxyj

A lot of places you go you very rarely get asked about where youre from probably because people are just trying to be polite and not pry or something but it always seems like when youre in the US particularly one of the southern states you get asked a lot and then people will tell you about places theyve been or tell you about where their families are from.

Edit Didnt mean to sound like a dick. Just to add weight to what you were saying about the numbers of aircraft lost  this is a glass sculpture outside the American Air Museum one of the buildings at Imperial War Museum Duxford where I used to work. Each little plane etched into the glass represents a real aircraft shot down or missing in action during WW. There are dozens of glass panels like these forming a wall almost half way around the outside of building.

3191125,0,t1_cosrcar,ampampamp Ambisonics sfw gtgtAmbisonics is a fullsphere surround sound technique in addition to the horizontal plane it covers sound sources above and below the listener. gtUnlike other multichannel surround formats its transmission channels do not carry speaker signals. Instead they contain a speakerindependent representation of a sound field called Bformat which is then decoded to the listeners speaker setup. This extra step allows the producer to think in terms of source directions rather than loudspeaker positions and offers the listener a considerable degree of flexibility as to the layout and number of speakers used for playback.gtAmbisonics was developed in the UK in the s under the auspices of the British National Research Development CorporationgtgtImage iInteresting Surround sound | Nimbus Records | Soundfield microphone | Michael Gerzon Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcosrdu oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecosrdu.

In the middle of searching for this elusive file your bosss boss will come ask why you havent finished implementing his project yet despite them not signing off on the purchase request which has been in their mailbox for a week.  At that point your desk phone will ring and an operations manager will insist that you come to the war room because the user that couldnt print just escalated to a senior vp.  You walk in to discover that the user decided to print to the other printer on the file cabinet and has been working away happily ever since but you need to provide root cause on the printer failure and what youre going to do to make sure it never goes down again.,Damnthatsinteresting,csy7e14,1,t5_2xxyj

It feels super overwhelming and youre like what? How did he spot that?

The most common example of a possible filter is nuclear fallout.

5743398,0,t1_cx83uyx,Along with other reasons also consider how wolves hunt. They are not stealth hunters like cat but pack hunters and each wolf has a job when it comes to bringing down a big prey. Many pack when hunting big prey have three main jobs chasers herders and ambushers. The chasers will run behind the targeted prey to wear them out so they are easier to kill. There are multiple chasers and one will nip at the hills of the prey while the others jog behind. When one gets tired they switch.Herders steer the prey in the direction needed. They switch in and out like the chasers but they run beside the prey at a distance so that the prey cant juke or anything. Also keep the prey going in kind of a circle to make it easier for jogging wolves to keep up. Their final purpose is to steer the prey toward the ambushers.The ambushers are typically the alphas. They are big and strong. They find a nice place to hide and wait. Once the chasers and herders have tired out the prey the steer them to the ambushers who spring out at the last second and bring it down. Then the others jump in and help subdue the prey while the alphas go for the kill.here is a video of a pack in action. This pack doesnt use ambushers in this kill but it still shows their brilliance in hunting.,Damnthatsinteresting,cx90vvd,2,t5_2xxyj

You appear to be confusing film for colour film. Which is reactive to all colors of light so must be used in unlit dark rooms. The exposure here is a negative. But its still on bw photo paper not film. In high school we used to make positives by pressing a second photo sheet under glass with the negative and shining white light through the negative to get the positive on the blank sheet. You already appear to know the similar process for enlargement. Not all red lights are equal you need to be sure of the proper wave length before you know it is safe to use. ,Damnthatsinteresting,cxj25kh,0,t5_2xxyj

8751244,0,t3_4zwqst,I explained the science here on my free daily trivia email newsletter back in . Heres the write up originally from here and if you like it please consider subscribing More than  others already have and many are redditors and only two have told me to fuck off this week.gt The video below is of lunch  lunch for an American tourist in Hokadate Hokkaido Japan. The dish is called odoridon and as presented below features a dead squid dismembered from its brain sitting atop a bed of rice salmon roe and seaweed. To demonstrate that the squid is fresh most likely the restaurant presents it in a stomachturning way at least to Westerners. They pour soy sauce over the squids legs  and the squid dead dances as seen below although you may just want to take our word for it.gt gt Whats causing this to happen? Is the squid actually alive?gt Rest assured the squid is dead  just recently so. In fact the same thing happens to frog legs as seen here  and there is clearly no brain present. Rather the squids cells still contain some unused adenosine triphosphate or ATP which powers muscular contraction and expansion and therefore movement. But ATP cant simply act on its own accord  it needs something to make it go. Typically thats provided by the central nervous system which through electrical impulses causes the ATP to do its thing. With no brain involved the ATP just sits dormant and over time dissipates as the nowdying cell fails to create new ATP.gt But the soy sauce makes the typical atypical. Soy sauce contains sodium and potassium. The sodium and potassium ions together work as a trigger of sorts causing the ATP to contract and expand the muscles. The result a dead dancing squid headlining and perhaps ruining your meal.gt Bonus fact Looking for a Japanese delicacy which wont make you want to vomit? You are in luck! As reported by NPR in Japan Kit Kats come in four flavors not seen in the U.S. banana ginger ale wasabi and yes  soy sauce.,Damnthatsinteresting,d6zk8ug,234,t5_2xxyj

9205239,0,t1_d8iti6n,Yes its everything you want from a shonen.  The downside is it starts off pretty slow and the author takes long breaks from writing so once you get caught up you might have to wait months or longer before you get more chapters though there is a point after a major arc that works as a defacto ending if you want a decent conclusion.  Having said that its an incredible work that has an attention to detail that very few other manga posses.  It constantly subverts your expectations and has incredibly deep characters especially the villains.I highly recommend the recent anime as it is a very faithful adaptation.,Damnthatsinteresting,d8itzu1,4,t5_2xxyj

9247390,0,t1_d8o26rb,The main force torque is transferred through basically a giant slot screw with no taper. That seems more durable than multiple gear teeth which are only there to accommodate rotation in opposite directions. There is close to  degrees of solid metal to resist that force.The stress would be from friction from that middle plate sliding back forth from the offset. Can you imagine if it wasnt greased? Or if the grease wore off? And the force would be transferred to whatever is holding each shaft in place bushing? bearing?.  Basically it has to slide back AND forth with each RPM. ,Damnthatsinteresting,d8o6ata,3,t5_2xxyj

The price was fair for what we got during our stay. For the rooms they were just concrete boxes and no beds. We had to deficate on the floor in our rooms so it got pretty smelly.  We had showers with fire hoses three times a day so we were really clean. The dogs that barked at us through the bars were a bit annoying but not nearly as annoying as the blareing pop music.  The staff would sometimes offer us some relaxing water therapy which was a really nice treat and not somthing we expected.   Picture time was my favourite activity. We dressed up in burlap sacks and took photos dare I say NAKED...I know I know not like me but it was so much fun.  Anyways the reason we rated it a . was the fact my wife got food poisoning from one of the meals they slid through the door.  But other than that a really great getaway for the price.

Was awesome at the time feel like an asshole now.Eventually found  machines that would give back a dollar in change if you hit the refund button. Had    bucks in quarters to waste on whatever all summer long.,Damnthatsinteresting,dgqhxa7,109,t5_2xxyj

11743373,1,t1_dgqiww5,This is melodrama. Tickets are not money! Not even close. If I put  in a ticket machine I am not guaranteed ANY tickets. If I get none did the machine steal from me?  Teaching kids that tickets are like money is really fucked up. Theyre magic beans. Getting them is arbitrary no matter how hard you try you cant earn them and no you usually cant even get a candy bar with them.,Damnthatsinteresting,dgr53c5,0,t5_2xxyj
