3480978,0,t3_304jsu,Thats exactly what Im doing now. My senior design is going to be a proof of concept of sorts of a new form of biosuits that will allow better conditions for people to be in space. After graduation Im going to try to get into a position called human factors engineering as my curriculum for biomed engineering very close to bioengineering from what Ive seenheard deals a lot with the human body and how things function with it. That being said if you want to work on designing ships and all that sort of stuff I would go with the more conventional engineering of ME or EE or AeroE etc. as I think those are more pertinent. But its still not impossible to land a job outside of what you studied in undergrad,bioengineering,cpp21qb,2,t5_2sb13

3915556,0,t1_cr2j32w,The USA are always  when it comes to Prosthetics due to DARPA funding. The famous lab at the moment is MIT  but others here will be able to provide a better breakdown of the big players.My University Strathclyde in the UK has the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics  which really interested me as it was what I thought I wanted to do before finishing my MSc. It turns out that even with the National Centre there isnt a lot of research done here which disappointed me but I ended up moving into Orthopaedics anyway.Despite that there are a decent number of PampO companies within the UK but due to having a smaller population and smaller military we cant really compete with America.What nationality are you?,bioengineering,cr2lxpj,1,t5_2sb13

5941003,0,t3_3wq7ea,Even if you get a Biological PhD most likely your area of expertise will be highly focused which may not be relevant in the medical industry for the next  years or so. If you are truly passionate about biological engineering then you can make an undergraduate degree work. However make sure that the curriculum at your school incorporates enough engineering into the year BS biological engineering plan. Schools that focus too much on biology often make the topic way too broad as many other people have mentioned and that may make it difficult to land copsinternships etc.,bioengineering,cxye985,3,t5_2sb13

6315917,0,t3_4231vd,Math take as much math as you can. Also talk to a college counselor NOT a high school counselor about taking college level classes at a local Junior College. What university do you want to go to? and what is the closest junior college? Biomedical Engineering is a tough major to make work for both careers and graduate school. Consider different types of engineering such as Chemical or Electrical. From those two fields you can specialise into biomed in graduate school. ,bioengineering,cz7jsye,4,t5_2sb13

8066551,0,t3_4pl337,engineering  over biology.  You can learn almost as much about Bio from Crash Course or Khan academy than you will from a  year community course.BUT you can take your intro to bio courses usually anyways as electives.What I did as a BioE transfer from community college was went to the big uni nearby I wanted to be a part of and sat down with some guidance counselers and talked about what I should do with what was available at community.  The school had a transfer agreement too so those courses all transfered over though I ended up doing Neuro undergrad instead of BioE.BE CAREFUL WITH TRANSFERS.  A TON of people will tell you it is easy and its the farthest thing from it.  You can lose thousands of dollars and hours if youre not careful as shit about triple checking what will transfer and what wont to a particular program major department college within a university.  Any of those levels can say no to a class.Also theres program requirements and that can keep you from resonably hitting timelines.  When I transfered Id have to take  more required courses that were all sequential at the big uni.  That means it was gonna take an extra  years over what I was hoping for to finish because those courses HAD to be taken back to back.  Gotta really watch that stuff and lay it all out.MechE is great though be sure to get lots of CAD experience where ya can build up a portfolio of drawings it will help a ton when you go job hunting. If you have a big research Uni nearby be sure to ask about joining a research lab as a volunteer in a BioE lab as that can be great experience and give you a bit of the college lifestyle that community lacks,bioengineering,d4mr8xj,1,t5_2sb13
8072174,0,t3_4pqfee,You sound a lot like me. I did a Bioengineering program and am now an Interventional Radiologist. My bioengineering curriculum had two tracks Bioinstrumentation which is heavily based on electrical engineering designing devices like EKG EEG MRI CT etc and Biomechanics which is heavily based on mechanical engineering designing prosthesesheart valves and digitizing movement as in CGIvideo games. Id actually advise against studying either Bioengineering or Biomedical Engineering. If you plan to stay in engineering do EE ME or ChemE with a minor in Biology and then do a Masters in Biomedical Engineering in a program that specializes in your specific interest after you learn what that is during undergrad. If you plan to continue into medicine any engineering course is going to be unnecessarily arduous.,bioengineering,d4ndzze,1,t5_2sb13
