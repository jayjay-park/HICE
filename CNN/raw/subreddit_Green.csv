240874,0,t1_cf5p206,I think the scope in which we compare the number of jobs is too small. I dont remember the last time a country started a war for green technology. Or when a bunch of billion dollar green energy companies created thinktanks and huge lobbyist firms to spread disinformation. Or when green technology groups hired mercenary groups to protect their interest or when green technology had a environmental accident and had to hire fleets of boats and dive teams to clean it up. All of those are actives that created jobs that I dont see in the green technology field but those are still jobs created and linked to oil and gas. That aside I believe once we get green energy past the  of total energy production then we can start treating energy as a public infrastructure. Just like a side walk or a road everyone pays a tax and everyone gets to use it. ,Green,cf5pvd3,2,t5_2qh6q

3834831,0,t3_34bjq1,This is one more reason to hate Ethos water. Ive always said it was bullshit. They give a paltry  cents for every bottle of water they sell. Its nothing more than a marketing gimmick to make people think they are helping others. You can buy a  pack of Nestle water for .. About  cents more than one bottle of Ethos. Im not saying you should buy Nestle water or bottled water at all but if Nestle can make a profit off that think of the markup StarbucksEthos is getting and again they give one measly nickle.  ,Green,cqtek68,1,t5_2qh6q

9820242,0,t1_danjt6d,Ah I see what you mean. California is an essential participant but each state should be equal members of the coalition. I like your idea for having each state focus on a single bill sharing the load. And I definitely agree on keeping the bills small making them faster to write easier to approve and less liable to infighting as you put it. So based on that structure the challenge becomes the initial green agenda the framework that all these small bills plug into. Getting everybody together to agree on the overriding goals and objectives then allocating which state owns which bill sounds like a bureaucratic challenge way above the legislation itself. ,Green,danlgu4,1,t5_2qh6q
