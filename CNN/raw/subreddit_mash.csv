Theres another truck that is painted and kept up as a prop along with a replica of the sign Those pics are mine. Theres no mess tent.  Its just some benches.

6888516,0,t3_4a2nn4,What made MASH truly great was that it literally rewrote the book on what a sitcom was how it works and the subject matter it handled. To understand why a show was great you have to understand not only the show itself but atmosphere and environment in which it was presented.Take a look at all the other sitcoms popular on TV when MASH began. There were some excellent shows but they all followed the same basic format and they never ever did anything controversial. In a traditional sitcom by the end of the episode everything had to be exactly the same as at the beginning unless it was a parter or something ready for the next cookiecutter script.MASH over the course of its evolution changed all that. MASH proved that audiences could be made to cry during a comedy  and love it. Think about that. Try telling the producers of the Mary Tyler Moore that they should do an episode about say abortion. Not gonna happen After all remember that Marys character was supposed to be divorced but they changed it to her fiance left her at the alter because s audiences couldnt handle the idea of a divorcee as a main character.MASH dealt not only with the comedy but with the horror and tragedy of war. Other comedies of the time were shows like the Brady Bunch Happy Days Sanford and Son Threes Company etc. All fun shows but hardly about to tackle any truly challenging issues. Youre not going to find a teen pregnancy episode of the Brady Bunch for example.MASH literally did what all experts at the time thought was impossible bringing drama and real character development to a genre which was ossified. Sitcoms of the time had to remain the same and went through gymnastics to do so. Actor leaves the show? Replace them with a carbon copy.MASH actually took the opportunity presented by an actor leaving to revamp the show and introduce truly new and vibrantly different characters. MASH proved to the studios that comedy could be thoughtprovoking and different and that audiences would not only continue to watch but to do so in record numbers.NOTE To be fair there were other sitcoms of the time that were in their own ways doing something similar to what MASH was accomplishing. Notable examples being All in the Family with the Jeffersons and Maude as spinoffs WKRP and SOAP.,mash,d0x4pcx,17,t5_2s9zu

11158465,0,t1_dewkk3u,I think the point for not remaking is things are not really different now the world hasnt changed in respect to human nature. The actual war and enemy can be interchangeable but the message stays the same so if the show did the job right the first time it shouldnt need to be updated. It is not like selfishness ignorance greed hatred fear and demonizing and dehumanizing a group has gone away all the moral messages they had to make are still all relevant. There are still Frank Burns in the world.,mash,dewst8q,3,t5_2s9zu
