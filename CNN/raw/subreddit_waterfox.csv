4314843,0,t1_csbu0o3,Yes and touch hasnt worked? Its right there in the bugs Ive linked to. Heres what I really dont understand and I feel like maybe a language barrier is in the way? But you seem to come into every post with guns blazing trying to make Waterfox look bad. And the way you phrase your sentences are very attacking.I mean thats fair enough its good to be critical. It makes me be on my toes and try to do the best I can. But you can go through the source and see anything I do related to modifying the touch related code or otherwise is unchanged. Why would I purposefully go out of my way to change that? And these leaks you mention you never link to any bugs about them you just say theyre there and thats it. If you were really here to help youd post to the bug and say Hey pal have you managed to plug this leak yet? Instead you do the exact opposite and try to make it seem like everything else is better than Waterfox. Fair enough if they are competition is good but Im just here trying to make a positive difference on the web. If you want to be critical be critical in a way that helps me improve Waterfox rather than attacks it and tries to peddle whatever other browsers you prefer.  Remember Im just one person.,waterfox,csc0d8c,0,t5_2vnvl

4959383,0,t3_3ilkij,Theres an article here that deals with this issue. If this doesnt help your security software might be trying to interrupt the secure connection Waterfox is trying to establish with the server.,waterfox,cujo46a,1,t5_2vnvl

5369273,0,t3_3oiel9,It should keep everything exactly the same. If youre worried just copy the portable folder somewhere and then update the portable version. Everything is stored in those folders and nowhere else on the computer.,waterfox,cvxzgpp,1,t5_2vnvl

Here are two screenshots of it running on my computer  RuneScape as its the only signed Java app I know to find easily and If you type aboutplugins into the address bar is Java not listed there at all? Also what is the installed directory?You could also try modifying the following preferences in aboutconfigextensions.blocklist.enabled to falseplugin.state.java to ,waterfox,d04z12u,2,t5_2vnvl

9777174,0,t1_dabsubf,Go to the addons area. Check to see if shockwave flash is set either to ask me or always activate if it says anything else that is your problem. It also needs to be uptodate. Sometimes there are multiple updates in less than a month. Check to make certain you have the latest.,waterfox,dai93f2,2,t5_2vnvl

10088397,0,t3_5kaez2,Hey there! V is so far the last version to have worked with XP but for some reason  onwards have stopped working. I was never able to test on XP until now due to having a new laptop that can run VMs . Hopefully next release should have it all OK again!,waterfox,dbmja5n,3,t5_2vnvl

11228822,0,t3_608ocp,A lot of people seem to be having a problem with that addon in general.   However looking through the issues it seems that es the multithreaded process might be the cause of it.   You can try disabling it             Type aboutconfig in the browsers address bar.        Confirm that you will be careful.        Search for browser.tabs.remote.autostart.        Doubleclick on the preference.    Setting the value of browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true enables the multiprocess architecture in Firefox setting it to false disables it.,waterfox,df4rszg,1,t5_2vnvl
