If youre near the border to Katy Ritters has the most delicious ice cream in the world. Towards Tomball is less fun but much more amazing food.

7872787,0,t3_4m1azu,Ha. If a guy asks for full body pics theyre pervertedonly looking for one thing. If a guy implies someone could be legitimately stealing pictures in a place obviously occupied by men and women theyre crying to other males and are immature. Its up to the guy to reply not the girl who not only got the pic she wanted already but could simply do the same send one back with face covered.Im no feminist basher. I respect women and know that guys online are far and away mostly creeps. But online dating has all kinds of double standards on both sides. This isnt the hill to die on.,houstonr4r,d40z27j,2,t5_2ucfi
