2337896,0,t1_cm0lheo,It strongly recommends it but Ive still been able to use it on a .ghz network. Its not good there are a lot of frameskips and its nigh on unplayable due to the lag. It can still be done though.And again it says it requires a ghz connection because it needs a fast connection. .a is not fast but its still transmitted across the ghz band. Its actual throughput is closer to  Mbps rather than the theoretical . Thats a connection of only . megabytes per second and thats simply not enough to maintain the stream at a playable rate. Hell my dual band .n router running in bg compatibility mode can still more than double the theoretical output of g which is also mbs with an actual throughput of around  Mbps at . ghz. Thats still not enough for a smooth experience with GRID or Gamestream.Its not so much the transmission frequency that matters. Its the speed of the transmission. That is again why an .a router which transmits at ghz is still listed as a minimum requirement just like g which transmits at the same speed but on the .ghz band.,theNvidiaShield,cm0od3m,1,t5_2xkph

In such case getting as much of internal storage as you can get would help in my opinion. For media you can use micro SD card..

Its the best controller Ive used. It has more in common with the Xbone and PS controllers in terms of functionality as it has an audio port and touch sensitive area. As a wireless controller it should result in less lag as its been specifically designed to limit lag by using Wificonnect rather than bluetooth.gtshould I update to lollipopI would say so.

Also the app register dualshock controllers as an input device meaning it temporarily overwrites touch which is a tremendous pain in the ass. I highly recommend the shield controller as it is painless and has much better latency and it requires no fiddlingNow if you wanted to use it wired you have to see if Shield Tablet supports OTG.

6336066,0,t3_427n88,So I bought myself a shield k a couple of days ago and other than having the misc battery drain bug I also have this absurd slow charging problem. Im using an HTC one M stock charger with both the HTC stock USB cable which works flawlessly on my phone and the nvidia stock USB cable for the tablet controller. In both cases its hard to just load the tablet I.e. its been on charge for  mins and its stuck at  so trying to even keep the battery at the same level while playing with it is impossible which is kind of fucking ridiculous for a tablet that is supposed to be used mainly for gaming. Im going to try and get a quick charge charger over the next few days seeing that my HTC is compatible with it anyway but this is seriously ridiculous and Im tempted to send this back.,theNvidiaShield,cz9uabl,2,t5_2xkph

7575976,0,t3_4j2hzy,I was in a similar situation as you. I kept bouncing back from Lollipop to Marshmellow. I wanted to install some large games so i eventual settled on Stock rooted Marshmallow with the adopted storage Sd card and ended up with around gb of space to use. In my experiences my laptop shows the adopted sd card after i restarted my tablet and set the storage option to MTP. I dont have any experiences with fold mount so i cant comment on that. Overall i would go with Marshmallow with the encrypted sd card. The updates also improve the tablet overall. Regarding the default install location. I think some apps are automatically installed on the SD card while some arent. Im not a  on that one though. ,theNvidiaShield,d33coar,1,t5_2xkph

7828572,0,t3_4m3wcw,Not sure if its the same problem but I have noticed the stock ROM doesnt have its own boot animation. So you get the Nvidia logo until the tablet boots into Android. Threw me for a loop quite a few times before I caught on because I thought it was stuck at the bootloader.
