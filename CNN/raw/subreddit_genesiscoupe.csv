4208688,0,t3_391jmr,I bought a  .t premium.  Only issues I had were related to the tail lights getting filled with condensation the clutch line bubbling out and needing to be replaced  the fuel injector wires coming off and a small egr leak.I drove mine aggressively stock except for a cold air intake and I got k no major problems.  When I sold it the clutch was still strong no cels.Id say its a great car for a college bound man  reliable minimum maintenance and very cool.

If so same car as mine. Edit also it looks as if someone was trying to dress it up. Nothing came painted gold and theres a BOV. Looks like its a forge. Id check for anything else replaced. Only major complaint I have with the car is the stock shifter. Piece of shit and will miss gears with fast shifting. ,genesiscoupe,ctokcdb,1,t5_2vq2g

5272021,0,t3_3n5wgr,Mine makes the same noise which I believe is the normal operating sound. It gets louder when the car is cold.Pushing on the gear lever without a clutch can really fuck the tranny up. The reason the car starts to move is because youre forcing the transmission into gear.Our transmissions are really tight since its a sports car and they need to handle a good amount of torque they wont operate the same way as a civics.,genesiscoupe,cvlk64n,2,t5_2vq2g

11174862,0,t1_deymnpz,historically what Ive seen with our model of cars is that even when you change settings on the honest to god debug mode they dont carry over between restarts.    This was especially appealing to me since the . ultimates in canada are sold with a backup camera and OUR stock units I have a  as well have the port right on the back for the plug. So all Id have to do is mount the camera and run the cable.    I further found out that when you enabled the backup camera in debug mode that it would switch to what the camera should be which would be a black screen since there was no camera connected if you shifted into reverse.    This got me extremely excited because hey! sweet new OEM feature that I can go enable myself...until I found out the settings dont save between restarts.,genesiscoupe,deynpc1,1,t5_2vq2g

You typically drain a catch can every time you do an oil change and most people collect  ounces of crap from the can that would have ended up in the engine otherwise.
