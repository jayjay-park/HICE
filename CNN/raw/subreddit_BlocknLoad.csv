With all communications we need to have ways for players to customize and avoid all the worst elements.  Dont forget to report at the end of the match anyone who is abusive etc.  They will get pushed into the graveyard queue and will play with other folks like themselves but most importantly not with you anymore,BlocknLoad,cnd3cnw,3,t5_328tw

3521763,0,t3_30ieic,New heroes are fun but the balance is a bit off in my opinion.Sweet Science is very OP. His main and secondary attacks are way too strong particularly with the flying. His hero block is also really good which adds to the imbalance. Giving him key blocks radar and spawn on top of that is also a bit crazy. How about the portal block blue mesh one and an ammo crate but no med block instead?Genies hero block seems rather useless to me. Her attacks are good but aiming is very difficult especially with the GFXs that cover everything. She seems a bit lacking regarding other characters. For example a well played Eliza gathers just about everything that a well played genie does and more. As a friend suggested perhaps her floating could avoid ground traps such as spikes and bear traps?Astrellas space gun doesnt seem to do much and is also difficult to aim. Her secondary is very nice so i suppose that balances out. The double jump is a very good concept but its poorly implemented imo. Ninja and Sweet Science can jump way more than her with their alts. Seems like she should get a bit more of a boost especially if her specialty is mobility. Her special ability is completely useless imo but i think that compensates with her hero block being so good.I think its important to note that with astrellas secondary weapon and sweet sciences alt primary destroying blocks and walls becomes much easier. barricades are less powerful and turrets are also nerfed i suppose which makes for shorter games.I like how Astrellas block is a good counter for tunnelers but its a bit OP. Maybe it should cost more?Good update but a bit rough around the edges.,BlocknLoad,cptpga4,3,t5_328tw

4069578,0,t1_crk56or,Im not saying shes way out of balance btw just I feel that out of all the characters available at the moment shes the most overtuned. It was also a statement about how easy her DPS is to apply. If you look at the global stats also they show the same thing.  Every character in the game is averaging .k DMG per match to heroes Asterella falling short at ish and all the others coming in at .kALL THE OTHERS but not Eliza shes sitting at .match thats roughly  more DMG output than any other character in the game is putting out per match. Also she isnt suffering in any department for it  in win percentage and her damage to objectives is about where the other characters are at not to mention the highest global KDnot that it matters much. Keep in mind Im not a super huge advocate of global stats being the end allbe all indicator but with a mean DMG of  above average thats one hell of an outlier. ,BlocknLoad,crk5rf8,1,t5_328tw

4357335,0,t3_3awzp8,An anecdote i cant help but feel is relevant and this has happened to me more than onceIve joined a short handed game my team is down  cubes and has barely touched the enemies first cube. Ive noticed its about  minute till the  min BBB gone to mid spammed out as much space control as I can won the BBB charged forward with a teammate thought their way under defended bases and won the game before they could stabilize.What makes this possible other than a lack of high level players of course is that the other team had been relying on a numbers advantage before I joined. They got lazy forgetting or maybe even not realizing in the case of AFKs that their dominance came from their numbers and so didnt diligently secure map control outside of applying attack pressure.I imagine the noobs on the other team might not realize what happened and perhaps think BBB is some kind of instawin. Sound familiar anyone?,BlocknLoad,csgszgh,3,t5_328tw

Considering I had to grind for gold to get lvl  little buddy boost. I brought it thinking with that much health he would have to go refill on ammo allowing it to heal it self a bit or for me to heal it up before he got back to try and out stall. Sadly that is not the case in the least. I cant even make use of my glue to hinder his movement cause he has the damage and base ammo supply to drop  of my turrets while staying out of range of Tony and the turrets.,BlocknLoad,cwogv1l,1,t5_328tw

6402475,0,t1_czhdd1f,I didnt cheat to get to the top like most people think. Sure I used exploits to show how bad the ranking system is so I could send a message to the devs but I actually have a very good understanding of how the system works. The amount of MMR you receive from a game depends on your deviation. This deviation can be increased by shorthanding games. It is decreased by quiting. The higher your deviation the more points you will receive. I currently shorthand about every other game and this causes me to receive about  MMR points even in noob queue and Ive gotten up to  MMR from one game. Sure I didnt get to the top in the best way possible. I got to rank  legit and I got from  to  legit so for someone to say I cheated to get to the top is incorrect as I would still be there right now because I have an understanding of how the system works.
