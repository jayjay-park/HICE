4414022,0,t1_csn5txj,Well if it turns over with your start stop switch apart youve possibly found at least one problem... Nothing may be visibly wrong but those switches can go bad fairly easily especially in salt water if you ever take your ski in the salt. It could still be the solenoid though. Next since its free and something you should probably do anyway Id go over all the wiring with a fine toothed comb looking for loose connections cracks in the insulation maybe a wire has worn on something and is shorting ect. Also go buy a brand new battery or get yours tested never trust any sort of gauge on a charger. To check your batteries you need a dedicated load tester checking a battery level without a load on it is useless. Even if your charger says it has a load tester its either lying or its crap qualityor both...With electrical problems you need to go through one component at a time preferably starting with the easiestcheapest to fix and make sure everything is known good until you find the problem. With an intermittent problem things get even harder and you need to be  sure things are good before moving on.Edit when you look over your wiring check for corroded terminals as well.,jetski,csn7171,2,t5_2smox
4477286,0,t1_csumgbc,I dont have a boat. I considered a boat for a little while but decided against it. The reason I went for a PWC is that Im right next to the water Literally RIGHT next to it and launching it would be as simple as dragging it down to the quay A journey of  feet and off I go. Now you might suggest that is actually perfect for a boat but I dont have the space for a boat in my garage and I dont really wish to pay mooring fees which are exorbitant and far out factor the yearly maintenance of the SeaDooYamaha.,jetski,csv1506,1,t5_2smox
4560766,0,t1_csszm5t,something similar happened to me as I tried to do the fountain trick lbs didnt go over so well sitting on top of the ski and it sank like a rock... in the middle of the lake. It was all I could do to swim it to the shore. Anyways I did what usuperrob did and works great to this day,jetski,ct5i2ee,1,t5_2smox

8038945,0,t1_d4jlje1,AFAIK they all top out at around  stock the higherend ones are just limited out of the box. According to this the VX HO tops out at  I dont think youre going to miss the acceleration but Ive never ridden on a  twostroke before. I can tell you that my SVHO gets to  in about  seconds though and while the top speed is very similar to the HO it gets there quite a bit faster.,jetski,d4jnic5,2,t5_2smox

11354320,0,t1_dfhpthh,Ive never heard a complaint like that that didnt seem like some form of BS. SBT warranties their engines and cranks for a year. People will blow up an engine from a bad carb throw an SBT engine in it blow it up again theyll warranty it and get a new engine and still say SBT is shit. ,jetski,dfizoxa,1,t5_2smox
