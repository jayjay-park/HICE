255300,0,t1_cf61niy,The entire point for me anyway is to not spend my time in any particular single place.  The world is my home or at least the  that is ocean.I do prefer the tropics and sub tropics.I have and highly recommend a sail boat... At least  feet  meters with a comfortable cabin.,xnation,cf77tov,3,t5_2woqg
267208,0,t1_cf8bwep,Subtropics currently.  I still havent done a puddle jump.  When I do it will probably be the Pacific though.  The only two reasons to cross the Atlantic is  you are tired of the med and want to go to the Carib or  you want to say you have gone around the world.  I have no real interest in the latter.  I still havent decided if the med is even worth my time.  It isnt subtropical.,xnation,cf8gfh5,1,t5_2woqg
