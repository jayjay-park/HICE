5189502,0,t3_3lmjsp,Hi plusnine! Its good to see you! Our server consists primarily of YouTubers for the purposes  Content control  mutual promotion. Generally we scout channels and look for people and personalities who would make a good fit for our quirky little group.We rent a server and we are limited on available slots so we are particularly choosy when it comes to accepting new members. With this being said we do accept a random nonyoutuber from time to time but generally these folk have become friends with us prior.Your stuff is gorgeous BTW! Also sorry about the delay about getting back to you we havent had a whole lot happening over here recently!,StarSquadronServer,cvbixvz,1,t5_37cjz
