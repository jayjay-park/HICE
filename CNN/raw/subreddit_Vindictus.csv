1314705,0,t1_ciheitl,Paladin is vastly superior on Lann due to Fury infusion and Slashing high. Unless you cant attack cap with DK.. I have  characters Lann and Vella. I went DK with Vella because I use chainblades and the extra stamina is very helpful in HOI so I can get more hits in before waiting on regen. The only problem is that Ive no incentive to use second trans outside of emergency heals because I hit k in that form and k in first trans. My Lann is very undergeared compared to my Vella k def k with  pias and in Pally I can hit around k in first trans so add campfire buff  fury I am over k which is just k shy of capping LakoriaHavan. With Slashing High and the huge def buff I can afford to Moonsplit with Slashing High without fear of taking much damage. In second trans I have over k def with over k health. Along with the shielding skill you gain yet another damage mitigation tool so the boss has to go through that before it can even scratch your absurdly high def stats. I believe DK has a lot of wasted stats even for averagely geared players but the stamina alone is worth it..unless you are a Lann.,Vindictus,cihirlq,3,t5_2s3rl

Find a lv weapon you can afford and buy it remember to look at the items durability. From a quick check at the marketplace crafting a clean Nighthawk Glaive from scratch is m at the moment due to inflation caused by Arisha. If you find anything cheaper definitely get it. Enchanting with Valor is low risk as the weapon cant break from a failure.I suggest buying anything preenchantedenhanced only if theres a risk that the equipment will break by doing so. Unless you can afford NX to use runesYour armor can be kept at minimal enchantments chest with enduringmaster and boots with zeal all these scrolls are rank A so it wont break your gear.

2798863,0,t1_cnludh2,Ill add to this comment as well as provide my thoughts pertaining to why OP may or may not enjoy the game. This will undoubtedly be longwinded.It really isnt the lack of players but how spread out they are. There are  Channels that players can be on. While  people could be playing at any given time youll only see maybe  if youre on a semiactive guilds channel guild channels are superficial. Someone declares that a channel is their guild channel and no feespaperworkbuttonpressings are had. Channel  is of course always overflowing with people. I dont know actual statistics but it wouldnt surprised me if  of all online players are on Channel  at any given time. However on a notsohighend computer the sheer number of presences including animations outfits pets and stats can cause horrible lag.Also youll learn this soon if you already havent but the game is created by DevCat and is run on Nexons servers. Nexon. Servers. Are. Shit. Its bothersome but as long as youre patient its nothing to worry about until youre experiencing dialogue lag while trying to take the regular stops option at carriagesboats pain.Now I should address the questions OP asked as well. The game is completely fp and definitely isnt paytowin at least not on a grand scale.Weapons and armor can be enhanced to . However after your weapon becomes  trying to get it higher has the chance of breaking or  booming your weapon. In the case of  and  you can use Enhancement Runes to protect your weapon from breaking but not guaranteeing a successful enhancement. Enhancement Rune do cost NX which has a  scalar with USD.  NX.  After  runes cannot be used and its all up to luck. Theres a  chance to get it to  and  each. A  chance for the next three each. Enchanting is the same with higher Ranks of scrolls. Rank  and higher have a chance to boom but failing is not necessarily spelling out doom. Failing an enchantment lowers an items max durability. There are two types of enchantment runes. Enchant Rune protects the weapon from harm. Premium Enchant Rune protects the weapon AND the scroll normally scrolls are lost upon use successful or otherwise.Booming equipment isnt permanent the first time. You can talk to the Strange Traveler in the Inn and get your equipment back but only if you spend an absurd amount of painstakingly gained AP. After the first revival of equipment the item will be forever bound to you untradeable. The second time you boom it its gone forever. One upside is that booming will net you half of the materials used to craft it rounded down. If something is crafted with  W  X  Y and  Z you will get  W  X  Y and  Z.Vindy loves to hand out NX items during events luckily. A recent event gave us Premium Enchant Runes and Enhancement Runes. Pets are a rarity if you dont want to spend real money so are costumes and inner armor. Outfit sets that havent been opened can be traded ingame and the most recent ones will go for mil gold. To conclude its not impossible to buy a  weapon  in the game but because the chances are so low and the benefits are so good youll likely end up dishing out billions of gold. And if youre lucky you can get pets from events as well as permanent inner armor coupons. ,Vindictus,cnm7y27,1,t5_2s3rl

3460677,0,t3_2zutrv,Lv leveling up story content is too easy nowadays especially if you pick one of the newerlater characters and most players left are those whove been playing on and off since the games release they dont really need help with quests when leveling up alt characters since their so familiar with the game. It takes longer to wait for some to join have everyone ready up and launch the boat than it takes to just simply complete those low level dungeons.Even once you get to lv. where armor and weapons start mattering you still need certain ATK to actively participate and contribute in the more active SS raids S dungeons and Rocheste hero dungeons. ATK requirement boats thins out the already dwindling community even more. People just want fast raidsdungeon crawling thats less stressful and more facetanking play which is not a farfetched concept but many new and upcoming players trying to reach those requirements burn out very few make that far and keep playing.  What youre left with is mostly a very niche select type of playerbase towards endgame content there are some cool and chill players left but quite a few arent pleasant to be around for long.Between fighting so much RNG gated heavy content with Fergus amp Brynn trying to upgrade your gear hoping for that rare drops that can drop anywhere from  run to s of them or just considering your other option is to money farm to just outright buy the gear upgrades most just throws in the towel on this game.S updates softens the blow some and makes some things less asinine but news of it alone just makes even more people not even really play until then.And icing on the cake is the ever present lag.

3470757,0,t3_2zzznt,attack speed is less important than crit and balance.  Having leopards is your first mistake. The reason attack speed isnt as important is because of weapon drag.. that thing that happens when you hit an enemy and it slows down your weapon as a result. If youre not aware of this drag then try doing a combo hitting nothing then do the same combo hitting an enemy.. its obviously slower. Now im not saying attack speed isnt helpful. Im just saying its the least important out of balancecritspeed for a hurk. Recommendations  do double rank A enchants on weapon.. ImpendingValor.  this combo adds  attack speed  balance and  attack without risk of blowing up your weapon.  Also by replacing your leopards  attack  speed  balance  you will have an ending result of  attack  speed  balance.   attack is worth the  speed loss.I would also recommend looking for a berserker enchant. it does twice the stamina restoration as zeal.

If youre paying seals armageddon starts looking like a better deal.  Heremon and noblesse are also fine comparable to armageddon.Eventually most players have been aiming for enthusiastic  wellbalanced pirate armor but the cost of the scrolls and the numerous booms they entail mean that people dont usually jump straight from level  armor to wbe pirate.,Vindictus,ct9r42s,1,t5_2s3rl

4641619,0,t3_3ei0qq,Id generally suggest playing battles on hard mode at the beginning. While that might lead to you being somewhat overlevelled during the early game it definitely makes it more important to use at least some tactics and evasion at the beginning. You might even use the Season of Macha oath making it even harder. You will also likely solo many early battles anyway since there arent that many players there.As others have said early game is generally very easy the final bosses will be the only real challenge. Also Raids you should definitely tackle those with a party.Its hard to say when it gets really hard. My first Char was a Staff Evie when the game was just released so finding a party was easy and I could keep Hard Mode on most of the time. I still solo on Hard Mode up to the end of the basic Ainle storyline theres a much harder one in the same area for level  afterwards but I also know how all the bosses work so for someone who is new its no shame to use normal mode at that point already.Id definitely play on Normal from Hoarfrost Depths onwards and ignore the Season of Macha oath. From that point onwards a party would be useful but its kinda hard to find one. At  in the second town of the game finding a party gets easier and Id definitely recommend not trying to solo battles anymore.I definitely suggest that you always go with small parties and without someone way past your level. You will also get a so called transformation later which makes you very powerful but can only be used once a hour  Id suggest not using that much either.  The reason is that if you do so you dont really learn the mechanics of the game. I know my fair share of very high level characters who rely solely on equip and transformations but cant even be bothered to dodge.,Vindictus,ctfn4zx,1,t5_2s3rl

4883903,0,t3_3hsf7z,I can lend some insight into the classes but honestly the decision is one that only you can make.Arisha is like Orianna and Fizz had a baby if youve ever played League of Legends. She has some of the highest sustained dps in the game but she is also one of the hardest classes. You have to manage an extra mana bar compared to every other class. In addition you are playing an extremely squishy character in melee range without the added benefits of Evies range or mana shields. That being said she has like a bajillion different ways of avoiding damage but they arent the most easy things to pull off. I wouldnt really recommend starting with this class.    Staff Evies or stevies as some of us call them are a midlong range class with multiple supportive abilities and with the recent revamp one of the highest damage dealers in the game. She doesnt have as many ways of avoiding damage as Arisha mostly a skill known as Mana Amber which is just a fancy block but can heal it back up when hit. I dont really know how to describe her playstyle. Its mostly hit and run charging up spells when you can and saving them to unleash when you have an opening. I personally love this glass because of all the different spells you get to play with.As for Fiona the first thing we need to get straight is there is pretty much no such thing as tanking for others. Yes there is a skill called taunt but as far as I know its not very usefull. That being said Fiona is a tanky mofo. She has extremely high defense coupled with Guard which blocks all normal attacks and Heavy stander which to my knowledge blocks everything including unblockables. She is extremely good at soloing because of her counterattack mechanic and she has respectable dps output to boot. Youve said youve played Lancers Sword fiona plays extremely similarly to one. Hammers are a bit more like Berserkers in tera. Sword is all about blocking and counterattacking. Hammers are more about deflecting attacks to power up your smashes. ,Vindictus,cua5k7v,5,t5_2s3rl

4973021,0,t1_culd9yx,Keep your Wisp level  as well as sacrifice. Its too costly to level up in the earlier on in the stages of the game and you want to prioritize maxing your  other snaps that are Mark Of Death and Bloody Threads. Also keep your Life Drain level  untill end game caues the damage is mediocre. your Blink should be maxed first along with your Int Mastery and Magic damage mastery just a quick edit there.Now your wisp is good cause on activation it will summon a companion that will deal minor damage and also draw aggro away from  mob that youre fighting. This also works on bosses making evie a fairly good soloist.A typical rotation for evie would look like this. You want to have all  of your snap debuffs on a target a boss realistically cause any other mobs will die before you get all  on them  before you press your R right click to activate the snap. Depending on how many snaps you have on your target the total damage of your snaps increases. I dont know what the exact s are based on  debuffs but if you search around google or wiki im sure youll find it.Here is how I perform my rotation. I open with Bloody Threads EnhancedBT  LgtLgtLgtLgtRgtE  followed by Mark Of DeathMoD  Enhanced LgtLgtLgtRgtE followed by Summon Wisp  Enhanced  LgtLgtR  and lastly Life drain  Enhanced LgtRgtE.  The reason for using MoD and BT first is cause they are the longest combos plus windup that you have in your arsenal and i try to get those out of the way fast cause it it leaves you wide open in a lot of boss fights. Again your life drain the weakest of them all is on your target to provide the bonus to having all  of your snaps on a target. Here is a link regarding the snap damage procedures it goes well in depth. This post is quite dated but I dont believe this has changed as the current buff stacking has been nerfed from  to  for the stack rampA little tip for you is that your LgtLgtRgtE is your fastest animation spell and I use it to have the most mobility in hard boss fights. A lot of bosses will not let you always get your LgtLgtLgtLgtRgtE off in time before them hitting you so a lot about evies gameplay is making sure you watch the bosses movements to get everything off safely.   Here are the snap s. Evies initial ramping has been nerfed from  to  but it still applies. It goes well in depth so enjoy,Vindictus,culdx3d,2,t5_2s3rl

The first time I took a character to Lv.  cap at that time it took me around a month and it was OK geared for that time It wasnt really the real end game gear you would want to have to say Im done but it was good enough for raids.

Its hard to quantify that in numbers unless we do really deep analysis of not only the numbers but each individual character. I dont think Im willing to put enough time to do that.Attack speed is good until you can land your entire combo. It scales incredibly well if you can get off extra smashes since smashes are most of your damage. Once you start again with the normal attacks instead of the smashes it becomes almost insignificant again.In the end the answer is and always have been it depends. It depends on the boss attacks and how quickly they attack and difference in attacks. It depends on you current attack speed and the amount youll be gaining in additional extra attacks.,Vindictus,cvdheoa,1,t5_2s3rl

5950302,0,t3_3wx2w8,Hey man good luck finding the guide you are searching for. In the meantime I can offer my perspective on the char which might help you. Maybe you have already discovered all the stuff I will mention here but hey  I dont know how far into playing her you are.  I have been playing sword  small shield Fiona which means I have more experience with countering attacks then DPS which is focused mainly around the hammer Fiona.    For Fiona you do not have many damaging abilities but Amaranth kick does the job just fine. In theory you get multiplication on your damage by making your combo meter go up  and blocking counts towards that  so by blocking you are technically increasing the damage you make.  Therefore the core concept for highest damage as sword Fiona is to build up your combo meter as fast as possible and then execute the kick.     Another combos are suited for different situations such as your LLLRR combo is your aoe clearing LLRR is your crowd control for tougher enemies along with the use of Focal Point which is LLRL and I found LRR to be best suited to get rid of trash mobs if you are worried they might kill your combo or destroying pumpkins in a Halloween event.    The XE move LR is usefull as a panic button to get out of stunlockedandsurrounded situations or to unstuck loot from under the ground  you rarely need it but if you do its good that you have it kind of skills.    Heavy stander counter is a skill that I use often  it does a lot of damage when you hit it and that is what sword Fiona is all about  trying to counter as much as possible.  Shield enhancement is useful as it is meant just for that  counter bosses.    Slashing high is good if you dont care how much damage you take as it means your combo wont get interrupted but you still take the damage. In some situations the best defence is the death of the enemy hitting you  after everything else fails just use this as your firewithfire mechanic.    This is my experience with her if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.  If you find something that is wrong here or unclear Im open to constructive criticism.  Anyway I hope you will find the time playing Fiona as enjoyable as I did. ,Vindictus,cxzm500,1,t5_2s3rl

To think Ive given them more money than Ive ever spent on any game in my life..Edit A friend was also banned and their reason is just facepalm worthy If anyones violated a ToS its Nexon.,Vindictus,cym6oqr,1,t5_2s3rl

6255826,0,t3_4199jp,I think it turned out to give bow a little more dps in the revamp. However xgun seems much more fun now that a lot more of it scales with your attack speed. Namely the skills that pop up when you hold right click. Xgun looks a little more difficult as well but as a long time xgun player it looks like tons of fun and will feel great when you pull it off. You will still have advantages and disadvantages to your weapon class but the same can be said for any character or weapon path you take. All in all pick whatever one you have more fun with because top damage doesnt matter. As long as you reach a certain ATT level which you can do with any weapon in any class you will be in every boat and you will be having fun with the weapon you choose.,Vindictus,cz0pwdk,1,t5_2s3rl
6255874,0,t3_41a1ma,Yeah this game has a secondary password feature so that even if your nexon account is stolen they cant take your vindictus characters and do anything with them. They also have serious security when it comes to deleting a character in case your account was stolen as well. Unfortunately I have a lot of friends who have forgotten their secondary password as well most of them just ended up making new nexon accounts. There should be a way to reset your secondary password when you go to enter it in by following some support steps. If not though then hopefully you didnt have too much character progress and dont mind making a new nexon account.,Vindictus,cz0q3g1,1,t5_2s3rl

6321379,0,t3_4273dg,. Dont think about it like that every class can solo look at them all and find the one you enjoy the most. Also take into consideration the fact that guilds make this game a lot more fun and so does doing raids with other people.. Returning mercenary gifts will take you to  but will make you overly OP with the gear better to grind it out so you can get a bit better with the character especially if you dont know the game.. VIP is nice Elite Character Slot is useless inner armor  hair  makeup is also very nice to have same with pets. You should try to conserve some NX for Enhancement RunesFusion Cores and things like that.If you have any other questions feel free to add me as a friend at Archodi been playing the game for around  years now and I know my way around it.

Its not the biggest deal in the world  I barely notice when Im in paladin trans as Im mostly animation cancelling with ult  which costs so not stamina  its just a theory craft thing much of the difference between the two is.

7304186,0,t3_4ff18i,Vindictus used to be a lot more popular as it was the only online action RPG at the time that was any good at least. Then blade and soul BDO etc came out and Vindictus lost its niche.The game also used to be a lot better in some areas. Before infusing which is a dumb as fuck RNG system came out you had to craft all your low level items. This wasnt a problem as drop rates for low level mats were much better and I was able to craft a set per episode and then sell it on the MP.Doing that now is nearly impossible for most sets as most bosses drop junk armorweapons instead of the mats you need to craft the exquisite versions. So the low level economy got completely shafted due to the infusing system which made bosses drop crap worth nothing.The game is also so poorly optimized that it only runs on one core and even someone with a super expensive machine cant run this old game on max settings and host. Certain areas of the game are also incredibly FPS intensive like Misty Summit for no clear reason and devcat has shown extreme reluctant in optimizing the game. We only got a buggy multi core option relatively recently which most players wont use as it causes them to crash or kick them to town when starting the battle.The cash shop is also way too expensive . per enchant rune? WTF??? so most people quit when they hit the end game which is where they need to start using the cash shop and far too reliant on RNG especially in terms of getting decent scrolls good luck farming a mael ES lol.They also thought it would be a good idea to implement a ip block which has limited their customer base to a fraction of what it could be. And until recently nexon NAs customer support was basically nil you could file a ticket and not get any response for half a year...or more.,Vindictus,d28fqgq,3,t5_2s3rl
7389272,0,t3_4gholk,are you using static IP?,Vindictus,d2i3ym3,1,t5_2s3rl
7678888,0,t3_4khopm,Combat is still the best out there just be aware that  or even  is a big tutorial and much easier than what is to come.  Leveling will be fast no guide needed just follow your main story and do sidequests when appropriate like when you need to be  to do malina and so you do sidequests in rocheste or once you finish up your story and you grind in malina or s to get the rest of the way to .  This is the fastest way to level not just the easiest dont listen to any guide saying to grind colhen in flames or anything lol.Population depends on what youre comparing it to and when youre playing.  I can still manage to find groups if Im not picky at my odd times I can only play on Easts fairly early AM most days but I use the discord to find groups as there is no LFG mechanic in Vindictus which is quite annoying you cant even check all the missions at once have to run board to board hitting refresh   much easierfastermore reliable to use the discord.  I feel like this lack of LFG mechanic can make the game seem dead when really there is just poor communicationmanagement of parties  Id imagine if youre playing at more prime times you wouldnt need to use it but it has certainly reduced the amount of time i spend LFG.  its posted on this reddit or you can google itAs for your comment about as long as there is definitely going to be a reward for your grind Vindi offers multiple ways to grind Raiding playing the powerball lottery super rare drops with consolation prizes you get a point for every raid turn in points for crafting materials to make gear not efficient but it is the guaranteed part of raids and then various forms of lowerrisk mediumreward like grinding dungeon maps in s which is very tedious and repetitive but you are guaranteed a small sum about km per run and a good end game weapon clean is about m every run about  minutes if you know your stuff and also have a shot at semirare drops worth mm.  So as far as making cash vindi isnt as bad as it once was but there are still pretty terrible RNG things in place when it comes to spending it like the enhancingenchanting systems they are a little pw  you can pay for insurance ie no negative consequence of failurelike your weapon blowing up but you cannot pay for a higher chance at a success.  However these insurance items are given out fairly often for free right now I believe actually.  edit and of course you can bypass these enhancingenchanting processes altogether by simply buying whatever gear you want pre enhanced or enchanted by another player and  of the time it is actually cheaper for you to do so although it requires a high sum and people arent always selling.,Vindictus,d3f1l53,3,t5_2s3rl

8346654,0,t3_4twhci,Welcome! Ill start off with some quick information then feel free to ask more.Crafting is a very expensive and time consuming process. I wouldnt worry about it until you are used to the game and have lots of timegold.These items to give to people sometime require quite a bit of them. The iced drink is repeatable up to  times with each time increasing the amount you need to turn in. Other ones require you to get  different items before you can turn them all in might be  or  I was just using  as a placeholder. Always look at your quest log and que quests up on your side bar to keep track.Typically for new players I try to recommend playing the first few maps and mission to see if you like combat and get involved in the story quests to learn about the game. The side quests follow for a little bit but then you start to need to backtrack and farm to complete them. Dont worry about them until you start to understand things. The other merchants are not of much help until late game  for enchanting gear getting gems crafting armorweps upgrading armorweps.If I didnt touch base on anything I will happily clarify. The game offers a ton right from the start so it can be really confusing but it gets very easy over time as you just put the time and effort in.,Vindictus,d5kvv7v,5,t5_2s3rl
