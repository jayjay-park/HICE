1128596,0,t1_chwkkda,Boston was also playing their worst baseball of the season that weekend. Tampa is matching that this weekend.Fluke or not injuries and inconsistency are really dragging them down. I dont think they are as bad as this weekend has shown just like Boston wasnt as bad as last weekend. But with the injuries the way they are they might be. Tampa could really use someone like Jennings getting hot for a couple of weeks right now and its just not happening.That said not only is this game not over  is never safe in any game but its a long season away. Except for Toronto recently the AL East is full of inconsistent teams. The wild card situation is even more wide open.

1344897,0,t3_29he4j,Injuries and underperformance. I really think its that simple. The injuries are obvious Moore Cobb Hellickson DeJesus Myers and several others for short durations. Our big guys just havent played like they should. Price Cobb and Archer havent pitched as well as theyre able and when they have there has been no offense to back them up. While the outfield defense has been holding their own the infield just hasnt lived up to their gold glove  season. Guys like Longo and Myers havent lived up to their power potential while the rest of the offense just cant be consistent it seems like the offense is all or nothing.,tampabayrays,cikx0jb,10,t5_2s2cl

2602034,0,t3_2pmi49,The troubling thing about Myers was his contact rate. Even in his good  season his contact and strikeout rates were alarmingly bad. Last year when the power was sapped which happened even before the wrist injury his contact and SO rates were so bad that only the prospect of power kept him in the lineup.Whats even more alarming is that contact rates are not something that players typically improve over time even someone of Wils age. So you are left with a player whose value is completely dependent on his power ability which is  at this point in time  completely suspect. And that player is pretty much Dom Brown or Justin Smoak to quote Dave Cameron.And now hes going to Petco which is one of  if not the  biggest pitchers parks in the Majors. The idea that Wil will be the player in Petco that we as Rays fans wanted him to be while at the Trop is just not going to happen.That said I dont know anything about the players weve received in return so this may be a lateral move for all intents and purposes with the Rays getting a salary break and nothing else.

5124698,0,t1_cv3lasz,Agree with you on it being the prevailing culture and mindset around the league  that you have a named closer who pitches in the ninth with a three run lead or less. Ive loved that Cash has immediately ignored that mentality and gone with his best pitchers in the highest leverage moments. We just need players that want to pitch in those moments though not just pitch to a title or a name. Id been a fan of Box as well but this rubs me the wrong way. Being in Washington it reminds me of some of the Papelbon and Storen drama which I in not way want in any flavor on the Rays. I also cant help but wonder if Boras is in his ear about racking up the saves and sticking to the closer role as a means to a higher contract. Pitching in higher leverage situations helps the team the most but may damage a pristine ERA and sacrifice save totals. ,tampabayrays,cv3pve5,1,t5_2s2cl
