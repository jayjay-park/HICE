Twilight COULD have solved her problems on her own but it its that much easier for her to solve those problems when she has her friends to help her and vice versa to the point where her friends are the default method of dealing with most problems. Its the most efficient way of going about things. Hence going solo is still an option but by comparison to the other option its so inefficient that theres no point in even taking it into account. Hence the shows name is Friendship is Magic and not Friendship is a mighty convenient but otherwise optional way of dealing with issues.I agree with you there but the magic part implies that it is the only solution. That is what I was getting at. Magic is usually a form power that can make anything happen no matter what. Calling the show Friendship is magic can pretty much translate to with friendship nothing is impossible and should be the only option PERIOD. This is especially true when you take into consideration how powerful some of the actual magic is portrayed on the show. gt What they were doing was textbook yellow journalism. They saw people doing things blew it out of proportion and took it out of context so that their newspaper would get more attention. Thats why the paper exploded. People like spicy shocking exaggerated news. Does that make an unpleasant implication about the denizens of Ponyville and real people? certainly.Again you are missing the fact they are kids and kids do dumb shit like that. Remember their very first article was a complete accident. It was only after they noticed how big the first article was and how popular it became was when they decided to go the yellow journalism route. It wasnt like that was their plan from the start.gt The mentality behind an offense doesnt change the severity of an offense. A and C might be different but if both result in B B should be judged on its own merits and not on the merits of A or C. If they did it knowing the consequences that their actions would have on people would the end result be different? I somehow doubt it.You are right it doesnt change the result but you are still overpunishing kids who dont fully understand the errors of their ways. This is why we as a society dont give kids the death penalty or prosecute them as adults when they murder another. It has to be proven that they knew full well what they were doing and knew what the result was going to be. Unless death was the intended result and the kid knew that was going to be the result they arent tried as adults.When they made the paper and started their stories on the citizens they clearly didnt know what the results were going to be. They didnt know it was going to hurt or offend them. They definitely didnt know that it was going to end up with the whole town hating them. This is why they kept on doing it to the point to where the town did hate them.gt Which isnt a justification for committing offenses that hurt a lot of people. There have been numerous cases of teens and preteens committing felonies. The felonies had severe consequences on the lives of other people If you would read up on those cases the kids arent let go. I previous said they should have been scolded aka let the punishment fit the crime. gt so what those kids should be let off the hook for being dumb and not understanding the full consequences of their actions?I did say they should have been punished. What you are saying is that they deserve capital punishment for something that doesnt even come close to murder. They blew some things out of proportion and the rest were actual truths that the town just didnt want to be made public like in the case of the one character dying her hair. Are you saying that because they said one member of the town dyes their hair they should but put behind bars because hair dying is equate to that of taking the life of someone? Because it isnt and they really didnt do much damage in letting the whole town know that one character does dye their hair.gt Look I agree that there needs the punishment that kids receive for committing adult offenses needs to be adjusted to a degree but it still needs to be more severe than a punishment that would result from offenses that children normally commit such as breaking a vase or drawing on the wall. They NEED to understand at least to an extent the consequences of their actions and a standard punishment simply isnt enough.Like I previously said. They didnt commit an adult crime. They blabbed about certain secrets of the members of their town and blew some things out of proportion. The damage they did was minimal at most. Some of the towns folk took it harder than others. The only one they did actual real damage to was Rarity who had her PERSONAL DIARY published for the whole town to see. The rest of the towns folk only got stupid shit published about them. They said Pinky partied too much. They said one dyed their hair. They said one was lazy. They said one was a snob. They said one had some sort of wig on or something like that. Nothing they published was enough to cause any real damage to the towns folk on a whole. Only Rarity took the most damage meaning the whole town shouldnt have ignored them and give them tough love because of this. Only Rarity should have.gt Lets say that someone masturbates  times a day. Nothing inherently wrong or hurtful about that. However that person would still hate it if people found out because its something personal that the person wants to keep personal. And if him masturbating  times a day gets put in a blownoutofproportions outofcontext headline such as Guys absurd masturbation habit  a generation that cant get dates the guy would be devastated. Privacy is a cherished commodity for a reason. WHY we want our intimate details to remain private and safe from scrutiny I cant tell. Theres probably an article about it on Wikipedia.I agree with this but the articles clearly werent of this caliber.  It was stupid shit that the kids saw. Kids wouldnt go to that extent and they are kids. The extent the kids went was stupid things that the towns folk took as a major crime such as your example. Only the diary was the serious offense.gt Which means that they likely came across similar situations with RD in the past told her to keep a lid on her ego and she kept on doing it. It would only make sense considering that they know her for a whileNot necessarily. You are missing how she reacted when the town started to praise her for saving the baby. She actually looked surprised at first like she wasnt expecting it. It was only after the town started to feed her ego when she started to take it too far. That means that she didnt act that way in the past because either no opportunities such as endangered children happened or someone else was getting all the glory and she was also too late to save the day. With all of that in mind that means her friends instantly went towards punishment rather than trying to talk to her.gt Her becoming a superhero is likely what broke the camels back and her friends realized that teaching her a lesson would be a more effective way of getting modesty into her head.Her becoming a superhero was what broke the camels back but they still went for punishment as a first option and not a worst case scenario option.  gt Besides youre making their solution more than what it is. I can think of hundreds of fuckedup disgusting ways to shatter someones ego. This was a firm but fair way of dealing with it. RDs ego wasnt shattered it was merely put under control.I disagree. Yes they did get her ego under control but they did go about it in a very excessive way. If the episode would have shown them talking to her and she not listening to them then you would be right but they did go all out from the start. There was no middle ground for them.gt Also you have to think about the context of the episode. RDs ego was overblown because she became a superhero. Peaceful conversations arent often associated with superheroes are they? in the context of the episode the solution is parallel to the problem.Again you are forgetting that they are supposed to be her friends. Obviously neither of us can say we know superheroes in real life because they dont exist outside of fiction but that doesnt mean she wouldnt have listened to her friends that she has known for who knows how many years.,thunderstroke,cpos9ol,1,t5_35ayj
