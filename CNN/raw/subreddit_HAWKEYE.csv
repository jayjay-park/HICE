4855418,0,t1_cu6hxnp,Secret Wars Journal is sort of a anthology series of shorts for Secret Wars. The Kate story was a really short one shot to explain how  Kate found herself on the wall in Siege. When the trade comes out for Siege I expect that itll be included in there. ,HAWKEYE,cu6k8mo,1,t5_2sf9k

6444552,0,t3_43xwma,First of all this subreddit is pretty small and half dead so you would get better answers in rMarvel or rcomicbooks.I think the whole Kate is a better Hawkeye thing is just for jokes. And the reasons Kate is being so harsh on Clint is because of some events that happened in the previous All New All Different Hawkeye series which had like  issues only I think.To my knowledge Clint can and always has be as comedic as he can be serious. It all depends on the writer.The Fraction run which is my favorite series of all time probably and definitely the best of the character is absolutely phenomenal and I think you are better off starting from there instead of the recent series. In the Fraction run you see Clint and Kate bonding and youll get better context on everything. Hawkeye remains just like ever an Avenger who often gets underestimated and underappreciated but still is a strong and valuable member of the Marvel roster.,HAWKEYE,czlwnha,7,t5_2sf9k
