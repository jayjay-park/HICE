423808,0,t3_1yegvz,Demons are typically drawn to people with strong depression and serious anger problems. Another thing is that some houses can have a dark history with black magic or Satan rituals. These can date from hundreds of years ago generally spirits who have had a past time at your house will be drawn to the activity. Ill give you an example Bobby Mackeys Music World is still haunted till this day. The reason of this is because demonic rituals used to be practised back then and demons were released from Hell. The two men who haunt the building were both murderous criminals who swore That if anyone prosecuted or came upon this lands building they will be haunted. I think the best thing you can do is to try to look up the history of the house youre currently in. See if there is any recent history about anyone who passed away there. My other option is to try and speak to these shadow figures ask why theyre here. If it gets worse as in serious threats I recommend you contact some professional help. I dont think its demonic spirits because if it was they would of literally showed signs to tell you to get the hell out. ,Ghosts,cfooy2v,0,t5_2r1q4

Now I dont think my place is haunted and only had this one experience well not inside my house but one early evening I was at home in the living room and had the front door open with the screen door closed so I could see outside my door clearly. It was a warm day so the fresh air felt good I was sitting on the sofa watching TV and saw a shadow of a person go across my front door just outside. I got up to look at who was outside and the only thing I saw was my cat running away. The shadow was full size like a man or tall woman and couldnt have been my cat. My front door is upstairs and my garage is downstairs so it would have been impossible for someone to run away that fast as my sofa is about  feet from the front door and would have seen someone if they ran down the steps.,Ghosts,cgtb1jl,1,t5_2r1q4

During the day there could be an apparition right in front of you but the sun is too bright to see anything. There could be voices or moans but you think its someone out walking or a car engine. People and most animals are asleep so we are able to make things out easier. Plus I think it has a lot to do with being convinced in a correlation between time and activity. Not that we believe it therefore our minds make it up but we believe it therefore our minds are in tune. Thats just what I think.,Ghosts,clxgup8,7,t5_2r1q4

5018726,0,t1_cuqj171,gt Its very easy for a digital camera to accidentally overwrite data onto a previous photo thinking it was empty space. The most common reason is because the internal software gets confused. The auto power save function turns off before saving a photo permanently so then the next time the user turns on the camera and takes a picture it writes over top the last photo and you get a double exposure.Except that this cant happen. If a portion of a file is written over the same spot you only get the bits for the new file. The files cant become merged. If it was partially written over the worst that would happen would be that one file would become corrupted and be unreadable. To get  pictures in the same file the data from the pixels would have to be manipulated in software and then that single file saved back to diskmemory.,Ghosts,cuqy4bu,3,t5_2r1q4

If the ride was stopped its not one of the operators walking around you can see the operator in the st pic the figure in the nd pic is not in uniform but it doesnt look like the kids are trying to get out of the cars so Id say its still going.

9108419,0,t1_d86noal,Ive done Sage and salt before. Read transcripts prayed. Nothing seems to work and thats scaring the shit out of me. I have  scratches on my side about..   inches long? My girlfriend had dreams recently today actually She doesnt live with me but she seems to be getting attacked as well. She had nightmares then woke up and had claw marks from a part of the dream where her sister had dug a card of some sort into her side and she had scratch marks  inches long in the shape of a square.Edit my scratches happened after this post. ,Ghosts,d86ooem,3,t5_2r1q4

I dont like youtubetroll logic..Also nice thing is computers were not strong enough to tamper with this.Also love content only before the s and such cause computerswere not as good or social media wasnt out back then..This was VHS.Had to be more creativeimaginative to fake stuff like this.,Ghosts,d8q0yv3,-2,t5_2r1q4

9430392,0,t1_d9bchh7,Thank you for reading  unfortunately the family no longer lives in that house. Re visiting is always something Ive wanted to do even if it was just to ask the current owners a few questions.A few years back me amp my elder brother actually did a few quick checks on the internet just to find out the current value of the house amp it turns out that since we moved from the property in  the house has been up for sale  times I would be very interested to know why nobody stayed there any longer then a few years at a time? ,Ghosts,d9bd7pe,3,t5_2r1q4

9905099,0,t3_5go7g7,This will be a TLDR comment so do with that as you will.There are hundreds thousands even of stories from Central Europe including Germany involving paranormal activity. But my biggest reason for thinking that there may be more instances of alleged experiences here in the US is simply because of the history.The Americas were built on violence and mayhem. Historically speaking theres no other way to put it. These things according to believers tend to create ghosts as violent or sudden death allegedly can leave the soul trapped in the mortal realm wondering what the fuck just happened. They also allegedly lead to another type of ghost a residual energy type of thing that hangs around in the area of an intense violent event Gettysburg Fort Meigs etc. and isnt exactly sentient or aware but is stuck repeating the events of its death on an eternal loop.Case in point when I joined the Army I was sent to Fort Sam Houston in Texas following Basic Training in order to become a combat medic. Even some of the training staff believed the base to be incredibly haunted. The reason? Fort Sam is located in San Antonio which was at the center of several bloody intense battles during its history and has more than a few native chiefs and military leaders buried there. Several people in my training company reported paranormal activity both on base and in the city itself. Couldve been bullshit but Im one of said people and I stand firmly by what I experienced.Europe has a bit of a bloody past as well and given that Im American I know little about it. But I do believe in the idea that an area affected by an extreme amount of negative energy and violent acts in a short amount of time is a gathering place for spirits and as far as America goes thats basically our whole country.,Ghosts,daynoqb,1,t5_2r1q4

10033124,0,t1_dbfar6w,Agreed. Proof is a tricky definition overall. I would say a man or womans word is worthy of proof though in certain circumstances. A ton of mental disorders can not be scientifically explained or solved but we go by the word of man and current sciences to define what we see. I would say evidence for ghost would fall into this category of science.,Ghosts,dbfcchd,1,t5_2r1q4

10046947,0,t1_dbh1wbb,Your hearts in the right place. It isnt paranormal but the video isnt fake. This is definitely just a dust particle. Its motion matches perfectly and its trail looks like what it would look like reflecting the light source of the camera along with a relatively low frame rate. ,Ghosts,dbh55o6,3,t5_2r1q4
10155123,0,t3_5lcl6z,Sounds like a typical benign haunting.  I once lived in a house where a woman lived with her adult son and she would frequently knock on the bedroom door at exactly am I guess thats when he was supposed to get up for work.  Sometimes if we didnt respond to the knock she would turn the lights on.  The activity grew more intense once our kids were born and continued until we moved away.,Ghosts,dbv51kf,6,t5_2r1q4

11503567,0,t3_638fly,From what Ive heard from many paranormal investigators most famously Brendan Cook amp Barbara McBeath of GIS you shouldnt trust messages from the dead.Art Bell did several EVP shows with Barbara McBeath and he once asked her why so many of the EVP recordings sounded like little children in distress especially the well known recording of a child drowning.Barbara McBeaths response still creeps me out when I think about it because her response was Oh those arent dead children... the things that sound like children are just pretending. Those things were never human..Nasty.,Ghosts,dfzxh51,3,t5_2r1q4

11739142,0,t1_dgqbyfc,I get that k is nothing for a  story house if you live on one of the coasts or in a major city like Chicago or Denver but this is small town Texas.  A home that looks like it needs new electric plumbing roof and drywall then having everything repainted in a town thats probably struggling to get residents as it is shouldnt cost that much money.  Off the bat it looks like it would cost K for the bare improvements to make the house livable.,Ghosts,dgqntyn,2,t5_2r1q4
