They dont factor in the human element of mix ups and adrenaline filled hesitation. Its good to tests new character on bots to get used to the flow but honestly after that just go online and play till you get it down. Bots have habits that can be exploited that can hurt your overall game like back roll catches and other small stuff. Learn the basics publishers and plausible play ghost mode till you feel comfortable with the character. Then go online and learn how others play ,Tekken,ceip4xg,2,t5_2s7yn

322354,0,t3_1xrv9s,Congratulations you found the real meaning behind TR! I mean I could go on for days about the things that annoy me in TR but it was meant to intro or reintroduce people back to Tekken. The fact that you rather play with no skill point is always a good sign of a more serious player. I say keep playing with those guys and always challenge yourself to harder matches just because theyre a higher rank than you doesnt mean there unbeatable some of the time. But eventually get T or TT depending on the funds because as a person who went from T to TR then to TT...You will know the difference  ,Tekken,cfe6kmv,4,t5_2s7yn

997047,1,t3_25irhm,Well Tekken is way popular where I live Germany. A lot of people associate fighting games only with Tekken and dont even played or seldom SF which is rather odd. In my opinion Tekken is way easier than SF combos can mostly easily be executed with button smashing of Square Triangle or Square and Circle because even smaller children can play against others and win. Of course more experienced players will play them out but Ive saw enough people expecially girls who didnt play video games but won against experienced players. SF needs way more correct inputs which is really hard if you are not that into games and makes it really hard barrier to enter.Ive started late with rd strike and SFIV and its way harder than Tekken. I would bet that people quitrage SF way faster than Tekken. What needs to change? Fewer characters but they have to be unique and fun to play Take out the new characters and instead use Tekken  DR roaster it was the best one No weird anime bullshit characters with chainsaws and boring fat dudes Since Tekken but keep the great endings from Paul Heihachi Law and Kuma because its really motivating people and are fun to watch with people Better stages and soundtrack like Tekken Way more settings like up to  healthFast loading times and direct to fight without long introsI would also mention that in my opinion Tekken  was almost perfect in every aspect. It had almost everything I mentioned. Tekken  DR somehow changed stages and soundtrack to the worse but added two good new characters. At least thats what I wish for a perfect Tekken game... ,Tekken,chhmdx3,1,t5_2s7yn

1532791,0,t1_cj3qrx2,It is really a spur of the moment situation and often commentators are confused by pros decisions sometimes. Heres how I make those decisionsRedlife I got a launcher at the start or when both players are near full health. Going for red life is awesome for preventing comebacks. Tag Assault There are  three important questions to ask does this character have rage? Do I care that they have rage? Can I kill?If you want to get rid of a characters rage TA. If you can kill TA. Basically be aware that you are giving the opponent rage because of the insane damage you may do. Pros nearly always tag assault because landing launchers is so rare and the damage is too good to pass up on. Wall Carry this takes a lot of playing to get used to but eventually youll be able to tell when you can use a wall carry combo and when you cant. Usually wall carry from the middle of the stage start point will reach the wall. Wall pressure is a huge advantage so if you can reach the wall use wall carry. Solo Bound Combo I use this most if I dont want to prematurely give the partner rage. Sometimes this tempts people to stay in and not tag out and then my next combo wins me the round. These are just guidelines and theres never really a right choice but the idea is to maximize damage unless something is in the way you dont want their Paul to get rage for example. As you get better and better youll TA more often because the damage is too good. ,Tekken,cj8eu4l,3,t5_2s7yn

Theres a huge roster of characters none of them are truly junk characters with the exception of a few they all play very differently and all have really neat backstories. Character designs and general aesthetics are all on point too. However Im not sure if this is true for other fighters or not since I havent really played them but the main reason I love Tekken is because theres no bullshit. Theres always a way to counter something.

6494143,0,t1_czqx77m,I hear you.  I would want all non launcher power crushes but well see what happens.  About the amount of rage attacks per character  I actually assumed that multiple moves have the ability to do a rage attack similar to how some moves bound or screw attack so this makes your point interesting.  I hope for this as well because this will cause a variety of moves to use for combos and I love seeing different combos used.  That also makes rage attacks the equivalent to SF special attacks which can use meter to enhance since those also have diff properties depending on the move.  Heres another thing  the game has more depth with the inclusion of these system changes so there are more things to consider and research when playing which I personally like  is this tekken game as beginner accessible as they intended it to be?

6704547,0,t1_d0cpwy5,gt I dont think SFxT or RE has anything to doThe discussion was about how Capcom doesnt try to screw its fans. Well it did. gt They can screw around with other games all they wantSFxT was supposed to be this amazing collaboration between Capcom and Namco fighting game franchises. Like it or not SFxT is part of the Street Fighter franchise just like  Street Fighter EX or Marvel vs Street Fighter. gt its not like they were fully fleshed out and balanced characters So youre suggesting that releasing something unbalanced then balancing it later and charging people for it is a good thing? gt it is absolutely amazing and deplorable how people defend NamcoIm not really defending Namco. Im trying to convince you that Capcom isnt exactly a ray of sunshine either but it sounds like you really want to defend Capcom. Thats fine but at least be upfront about their shortcomings.Im not against anyone. Im for both of us getting what we want.gt Tekken fucks around arcade for so longOkay lets talk about this.At its heart fighting games are traditionally played in the arcade. Thats where these games traditionally make money. Starting from Street Fighter  starting from Tekken  starting from Soul Edge. Competitive home console is a fairly new development in the larger scheme of things.Second the arcade scene in Asia far exceeds that in the Americas. I dont know about you but I live in a modestly sized city and almost every arcade has closed down in the last  years. The only way I can play fighting games is on the console. Again on both Capcom and Namcos home turf Japan this is different. Even if they wanted to release arcade releases in North America it would not have been profitable for them. Our arcade culture is too weak.Third lets take a look at some home console release dates. Tekken  PSX Tekken   PSX  Tekken   PSX Tekken Tag  PS launch title Tekken   PS Tekken   PS Tekken   PS Tekken Tag   PS Tekken  lets assume  Street Fighter  SNES   Street Fighter Alpha    PSX ish Street Fighter  Dreamcast  rerelease  online Street Fighter   PS Street Fighter   PSDo you want to talk about how theres a massive gap between ttt and t? Or do you want to talk about how theres a massive gap between the street fighters? Or do you want to talk about how Capcom release little changes over the years and charge people money in between? nd Impact and rd strike SF SFAE USF? gt the way Namco does business guarantees that it will always be a joke on console as far as fan base is concerned. Whereas Capcom milking us every year or so with a console update is the acceptable way? If its a simple matter of balancing SF patch v. would have suffice right?But lets calm down and look objectively.Fighting games are traditionally played in the arcades. Even Ono had to go out of his way to explain why there was no SF arcade release Heres the quote that makes the most sensegtThe Namco arcades theyre still very much on the video game side and Mr. Haradas giving it a good run with Tekken in the arcades and more power to him for that but were not in a comparable situation concluded Ono.In  the arcade market in Japan declined to . billion in todays dollars In comparison Tekken Tag Tournament  sold an estimated .m worldwide. yeah I know vgchartz is not reliable physical only etc how much of that arcade money is Namco going to get now that Street Fighter  is out of the picture? How much money is releasing Tekken  before FR going to make back? How much do they have to spend on translation? Im sure Namco has the math done. Think about it they didnt sell enough to keep the WTF website onlineEven without slinging dirt at Capcom or Namco or alternatively putting them on a pedestal we can kind of see the reasons why different companies did things differently.

7338027,0,t3_4fuahd,Youll like her because shes fun and predatory. Until it becomes painfully apparent fight after fight that once your opponents start blocking your gimmicks and mantis low kicks youre left with nothing. In a sense she shared the same readable unsafe fate as Raven but she has no good options or traps to really boost her up to a competitive level. A lot of her moveset is situational if not useless.Her punishment is terrible. Even abusing b as a low whiff punish  poke doesnt even chip away like you want it to. Her moves that give knockdown like f and db have bad followups with d and dd if your opponent does anything except roll back.Tarantula stance kinda sucks. No good tracking options for the one stance she cant step in. There are options and transitions between all of her other stances but you cant get to TRT directly from MNT. At all. Of the moves that do put her in TRT they average unsafe. TRT d might be the only good thing to come out of it from something like SCR  on counter.Very very unsafe. All of her good scarecrow setups require excellent reads because of how poor her recovery is and even then her one legged movement is only enough to cause whiffs on some moves. For a voldolike fighting style she really lacks in range when she needs it. Her good heavy kicks like f and SCR d require pretty spot on timing to get a good bound combo so good luck online.Bad tag game all around. Fillers lack in damage and options and you want at least one or the other. Without a good wallsplat you cant really break  let alone dmg with a lot of teams.If you like her because shes different and has cool stances try Leo because she has the wall damage and hard CH tools Zafina desperately lacks in complete with the evasive fluid stances that make Zafina so fun. Otherwise I would try Baek or Hwoarang because they can move in stance much like Scarecrow except your options and mixups are much more scary.,Tekken,d2ca7ky,7,t5_2s7yn

8111403,0,t3_4q8tn8,Mishima practitioners can only be killed by other mishima practitioners. Akuma does not practice the mishima style and as such cannot kill either. The sen goku no satsu is supposed to destroy an opponents soul so they might become soul less but at that point kazuya would go full demon or the demon would be destroyed.  Heihachi would lose his zest for life and eventually kill himself or retire or strike a deal with their hereditary demon clan. Also the mishima style immortality thing has been proven repeatedly by heihachi and jinpachi. Heihachi tanked several explosive jaxes to the face which destroyed his entire mansion but he was merely thrown several miles away by the explosion. A normal human would have died by the explosion or the following impact. Jinpachi was restrained and sealed in the bottom of the mishima estate for something like  years before the aforementioned explosion released him. This is also assuming that gouki could even land such a complex maneuver against such skilled opponents. A mountainsplittler is much more likely. ,Tekken,d4rsmhu,1,t5_2s7yn

Youre going to be burnt up in no time.Personally the fun that I pursue in Tekken is the learning experience with every defeat. When I lose I do a lot or when I get launched into a big damage combo or when I fall for a setup I cant help but smile or laugh in admiration of the superior opponent. Then I try to achieve the second part of the fun which is not falling for any of those tricks again andor pulling those tricks on the opponent myself. The last resort fun for me is making sure the opponent doesnt get a perfect lol. Wanting to win is important in any competitive game but it shouldnt be the only thing you want especially since theres not guarantee youll achieve it.

8665684,0,t1_d6o60qt,I have to disagree. Just cause you still hit all the directions yourself does not make it legit to use in competitive play or tournaments. I think motions in fighting games are a big part of what makes it ok for some moves to be a little on the OP side like EWGF. The designers of the game clearly had planned for it to be not executed too easily. You can see the skill lvl of a Tekken player just by how he back dashes and that is a beautiful thing. Hitbox destroys the art of swinging a stick they replace it by the same thing the right hand already does pressing buttons. It should be banned for competitive play. Whats next? ... people design a  button controller and just have to piano over some buttons for a perfect EWGF? Technically they executed the move right? I guess Aris is right we will have to let hitboxers go nuts and there will be the point where either everybody plays on hitbox or that shit gets banned. This is like pad overwatch vs mouse overwatch. Hitbox can do things that are impossible or at least much much harder to do on a stick. Lets say there is a new high tech device that lets CSGO players aim by simply looking at a place on screen this would make them able to aim faster than mouse players cause those poor guys have to see and then move their arm. But they still aim themselves and do not use a bot. You think this would be fair or not?,Tekken,d6otvbs,1,t5_2s7yn

But I actually kinda like Namco devs release console version of the game lateThe first part I like it the way how they handle is that console players dont have to buy another expansion because Namco already go through the testing in arcade version and the console players only have to pay  for more of a complete package. A lot of things will be balanced and console versions of games have to make the single player story mode for each character.if anyone tried SFV console version it is SHIT. Sales tell you reviews tell you and if you played SFV on PCSteam version for me the single player campaign mode is one of the worst things I have ever seen. Like I can tell the devs didnt put any effort in it at all.I understand that for people who are playing competitively it gives an advantage to the players who can play arcade with ease.

Understanding who excels at what distance comes into many factors alongside things like tracking and movement based attacks also lead you to strategize the idea of approachingstaying away.Okizeme wakeup game in shortpossibly one of the biggest aspects of the game alongside pokesmovement simply due to the fact that staying on the groundknocked down can be either terrible or perfect when your opponent whiffs mid string.In short the biggest aspects of the game seperating it from other fighters aretrackingd factor and how moves adapt to it sweeps are essentially cover more than what is in front of youon more than one d plane to get the idea across i guessrelying on pokessafety of moves before relying on combosflowchartsthe comeback mechanic RAGE essentially like having x factor in mahvel or GG Danger time wherein the potential to dish out damage is there.

10881613,0,t1_de2cj1y,Im not sure I follow. If youre further away then all their faster attacks wont reach they need to use slower moves with more range to reach you. Also the number of options they have for that distance will be fewer and players tend to have preferred options in those situations so all of that should make it easier to react not harder. From the sound of it youre not actually reacting. Youre baiting people and then blocking the move you convinced them to do. Thats probably why youre getting hit by slow moves when they can come at any time because youre not reacting. The best way to work on that is to just practice a lot. Have someone randomly alternate between a slow move and a fast move and try to only block the slow one or something until you can recognize the animations perfectly. ,Tekken,de2d0ar,3,t5_2s7yn
