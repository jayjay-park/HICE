Do they not realize they live in a capitalist society and the young people Bernies biggest supporters are the ones who propagate the media more than anyone?

Maybe after some more time has passed words like retard will be taken more seriously. I think steps have been taken in that direction already if your comments are any indication.

7018542,0,t1_d1bu7uz,I think you make a fair point. There are a few major reasons why Canadians and other anglosphere nations feel the need to comment but my perspective comes as a Canadian.For Canadians we already feel like we understand America doesnt make it true because we are the most culturally similar and are very close. Our economy is more dependent on US demand than anything else we could do ourselves. Its not a bad thing just a product of proximity. We also look at our country and our experience with the US and think there are obvious solutions to some of these problems. But then again everyone believes their opinion is obvious.Canadians tend to have an inferiority complex that manifests itself as outward expressions of superiority and anti Americanism. We pride ourselves on universal healthcare even though our system has its own share of problems Im still generally supportive of it though and a lot of these problems are overlooked due to fear mongering about the US system.I guess this doesnt explain whether the foreign input is good or justified it just is an attempt to explain where we are coming from. These are the pains of being the premier world power you have everyones attention.As for the foreign berniesplainers theyre a bunch of hypocrites.

Theyll say something like well debate is a healthy part of the political process or I would think Hillary people could withstand harmless questioning which... fuck no. There are places on Reddit for political debate. The Hillary sub is a place for Hillary supporters to talk about shit  GOTV fundraising upcoming rallies or just their enthusiasm for Hillary. I dont feel like thats the place for rigorous debate especially when the people initiating think Hillary is evil and have no interest in honest discussion anyway. Lifes too short. We have lives and shit to do. We definitely dont have time to waste hours going back and forth on some fruitless debate that goes nowhere. The Sanders people can complain all they want but theyre pretty quick to silence antiBernie voices in their sub and elsewhere so pot meet kettle. If a bunch of Hillary people invaded the Sanders sub and started asking how can you support such a lunatic? or why should I vote for a guy who insert some blatantly biased distortion of the truth about Bernie here? all the time theyd be pretty pissed.

While most people mindlessly start to consider different aspects of the world when it becomes conducive to their social environment I did it when it was the farthest thing from socially conducive. Which means that I did it because of the fact that I cared about it I thought about it I considered it and I worked to develop an understanding over a fucking decade that I have rarely seen others ve able to equate to mine.

And then they see people like Bernie Sanders and say wait a minute is this an ideology that I want to be associated with? They make a mockery of what it means to be liberal and to be quite honest I dont even think Bernie is a liberal he just does whatever panders to Vermont and sometimes that can be very farright when youre trying to meet the needs of rural upper middle class white voters and people run away.

But the most astonishing thing is that even Sanders thinks this way.  He thinks that a silent majority of people support his views and the only reason why were not living in a Scandinavian utopia is because of mediacorruptionstupidity.  I can see how a yearold sp commenter would think that because he probably hasnt been exposed to people with different sets of views.

Its us taking our post industrial social roles and pretending the economic situation in the past is just like now with different clothing  see the Flintstones.In modern huntergatherer tribes adults are self sufficient and provision themselves while mothers siblings and maternal grandmothers are the primary providers of food to children.  Gathering is the most effective way to acquire food and the bulk of food in primitive societies is gathered  Hunting is prone to failure by definition so if you are provisioning for children you cant risk it.  Gathering provides both plants and meats digging up shellfish is just as much gathering as digging up tubers.  The loss of a maternal grandmother decreases a childs likelihood of surviving to adulthood about  among the !Kung and Hazda due to having less access to food.  The loss of a father by contrast  has no statistically significant impact on the childs survival because they are still protected by the adult males  Man the Protector is a real evolutionary thing  who defend all the tribes children rather than just their offspring in particular.  This observation prompted the Grandmother hypothesis which seeks to explain why humans dont die once we become infertile like the other hominids.  Our postreproductive lifespan could be explained by maternal grandmothers working to feed the children of their daughters thus selecting advantageously for longer lifespans.  But anyone talking about evopsych and Man the Provider is high on their own supply and selling weapons grade balognium.,enoughsandersspam,d2wpspa,6,t5_31c2x

7551238,0,t1_d30i07v,First off thank you for taking the time to make this post. I know you said it was a throwaway account but I hope you stick around to chat with us. Just seeing the responses to this post makes me feel less alone. Second damn... when I heard about your friend I instantly thought of a cult like mentality. The post was a bit satirical and some of the the things I wrote were meant more as a joke but to see how many people like you and the others who have posted on here have lost friends who were just so consumed by this presidential campaign is kinda sad kinda pathetic and in a way...a little scary. It sounds like you and I come from a similar train of thought. Little bit right wing leaning but not hating Hillary or Obama. And youre absolutely right a lot of his supporters treat Hillary like shes fucking Satan. Never mind that a couple of these people adore President Obama and like you said Hillary would pretty much continue his policies. Thats why I dont think shes a bad choice. Stuff like BernTheConvention is wishful thinking. Actually every time a poll closes its funny to see how the supporters I know react.  If he wins a state theres tweets left and right saying Thank you state name for helping the revolution! or Enter state has their priorities straight. Never mind that winning a state actually means just a majority but the other candidate still picked up delegates. But then when he loses they are FURIOUS. Its all I HATE AMERICA and I HATE HILLARY or This country deserves Trump for rejecting Bernie. Its pathetic. Ive encouraged so many of these people to actually look into the legislative positions up for grabs senate house local government but I know damn well they arent going to care. What a revolution this year showed to be. ,enoughsandersspam,d30jfr6,4,t5_31c2x

7715040,0,t1_d3j4hkf,NY is a perfect example of why closed primaries are bad in the extreme. The majority of races have only one serious candidate oftentimes running under multiple party lines. Both the Democrats and Republicans have carved out races that they are always guaranteed to win and so theres no competition. This lack of competition means theres little reason to vote so NY also has around the lowest voter turnout anywhere in the country. In the end its corrupt as fuck. Party affiliation in NY doesnt actually correlate to political ideology very well. You have Democrats who are super conservative and Republicans who are super liberal just because they have to be affiliated with the right party in order to run in their district. Its all about who you know and who youre connected to and not at all about your qualifications or what you plan to do with your elected position. Ironically NY residents overwhelmingly hate this corrupt system but its evolved to a point where its almost impossible to reform even with overwhelming popular opposition. There are three men who approve every bill that gets voted on before the legislature even sees it. So essentially the top three party leaders have absolute veto power over everything including any reforms. So of course they have no desire to make the system any less corrupt. ,enoughsandersspam,d3j5b8y,1,t5_31c2x

7804544,0,t1_d3t9th1,Okay but what youre talking about isnt really the issue but rather people talking about the issue which is neither here nor there no matter how you slice it. Although you downplay the actual impact of metadata even on your basis its a considerable concern for many and certainly the courts. Using metadata on the number you called goes back to  with Smith v. Maryland where the standard was set that an officer could request information used by a third party for billing purposes in this case through the use of a pen register.Now in that case there was already dissenting opinions and it sparked considerable controversy I suggest you read the dissent which has become considerably more relevant in modern times. Now of course these businesses having these records and reserving the right to distribute them so easily is also a huge concern one that is often not well understood and many people feel is out of their control. And you know it all ties back into the whole Reasonable expectation of privacy thing established in Katz v. United States as it becomes more and more evident that courts cannot rely on trespass to determine whether or not there was a violation of privacy. Its a hugely complex issue that I could hardly do justice even after writing  pages on it but what I will say is you are downplaying and dismissing something that is a considerable concern not just for the general populace but for many levels of government as they figure out how to actually handle the matter. We live in what is many ways a watershed moment for online privacy since right now the matter is somewhat up in the air. Dont become so against bots that you become one yourself. This is a serious issue not as many laypeople talk about it but part of an ongoing debate in the US thats over a century old and is seeing serious developments in this exact time period due to technology. ,enoughsandersspam,d3taj55,0,t5_31c2x

And it doesnt appear like he cares much which is just bizarre to me.No one ever seem to believe me but there was a point in the middle of the primary where I legitimately started to fear that Bernie would be a disaster because he just had no competency with hiringfiringstaffing management  and you dont learn that skill in your s and every report about his past just made it sound worse with his reputation for not compromising or running out of meetings etc sigh,enoughsandersspam,d4gsgcv,1,t5_31c2x
