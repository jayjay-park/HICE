6175925,0,t1_cyq4nuf,I agree but most likely your order slipped through the cracks and all of the records have long since been sold. Its a bummer but a refund is probably the best youll be able to get on it. I saw a few go on eBay for  so you might be able to get one for around the same price. ,VinylReleases,cyrn0ga,1,t5_2suhe
6256798,0,t1_cyzngrm,Hmm....I wonder which one I got then.  Im pretty sure I got the x white vinyl but the website didnt say SOLD OUT of the x tricolor when I bought it.

9032825,0,t1_d7xkrkd,Think of it less of a single record and more of a collectors piece for the mission of the Voyager Record.  The fact that it comes in premium packaging has a historical book detailing the purpose plus the audio both digitally and on  LPs.  Its not so much and album as a historical celebration.  But yes it is expensive but with a little under a year until it arrives I think I can slowly pay for that.,VinylReleases,d7xlp90,3,t5_2suhe

10851109,0,t1_ddz7dns,Maybe Im just old but I could not give less of a fuck about a color variant pressing.  Its useless to me.  It provides nothing more than a small bit of aesthetic pleasure for the moment when Im actually looking at the vinyl itself and thats it.  Its just another selling point gimmick to me.Now whats not a selling point gimmick to me is the Virtual Reality headset and the ability to watch the full PHAROS concert performances with the headset.  Thats like having a front row ticket to the Gambino Awaken My Love! stage show any time you want.  Thats well worth the  price tag oh and you happen to get a dope xLP RPM pressing of the album along with that. ,VinylReleases,ddz7r4e,2,t5_2suhe
