1649387,0,t3_2d7b4w,Something Id add is that film stocks have actually added  stops in the last several years pushing their latitudes to about  stops.Also I would not follow a rule of  overexposure for the blackmagic cameras if there will be clipping because clipping is irreversible. Its true that they like light but a proper exposure is enough for the sensor in most cases. ,bmpcc,cjn2hib,2,t5_2ysye

1801410,0,t3_2f2tig,One piece of advice Dont go cheap with glass. Its all well and good to have one cheap reliable allaround lens but if theres one thing you should splurge on its lenses. Research and investment goes a long way. Rokinons aspherical cine lens line thats been rolled out the past year or two is phenomenal for the price you really cant go wrong with their mm T. and theyre about to release a mm T.Id also recommend having at least  batteries and  chargers if you dont do any sort of plate set up about  total the batteries and wall chargers are cheap. For reference its the Watson EL batteries if you want justasgoodbutnotbrand batteries. A handheld rig or anything to stabilize is a must. The x crop factor is absolutely merciless with shakingany motion with hands so generally dont just hold the camera handheld. If you own any EF lenses a lot of people have some Canon Lseries glass though Im not personally the biggest fan of much but the  f.I digress seriously consider the Metabones EF Active speed booster. Its pricey but its insane and has really improved the camera for me. Feel free to ask any questions ,bmpcc,ck680qb,3,t5_2ysye

2046480,0,t1_ckwiteh,Obviously its no comparison for a the normal camera ala BMPCC but Im just curious... could you maybe get a passable normal medium to closeup by filming wide at .K or K narrow and cropping to p? I hope that makes sense!,bmpcc,ckzybbw,1,t5_2ysye

3581253,0,t3_31c9pz,No matter what you do do NOT buy any gear between now and the end of NAB which is in a few weeks. That is when all the new gear is announced which often can change the price on current models and used equipment. Good luck!,bmpcc,cq0hp6t,5,t5_2ysye
3653220,0,t1_cq8kvb0,One thing Im concerned about though is the file size. I only have a MP Pro with GB and Im not sure that is enough. How much can you record with a GB card?,bmpcc,cq8oyyj,1,t5_2ysye

4005672,0,t1_crcviby,Yeah I would love a speedbooster. But Im sort of tight on money. Looks like Ill be getting the sandisk extreme gb a EF to m adapter and a power bank. Then I will save up for the rest,bmpcc,crcvl7e,1,t5_2ysye

8303539,0,t1_d5fhtzz,The GH isnt the optimal vlogging camera but it sure as hell is much more convenient to use than a bmpcc. Point and shoots such as the Gx and the RX series will allow the user to take selfie shots. Mounting the monitor on the cold shoe is exactly what makes the camera clunky and inconvenient.,bmpcc,d5fi029,1,t5_2ysye
8501217,0,t1_d643yuk,If I didnt already have the Pocket camera I would definitely go for the Micro. The  FPS would be really helpful. Not having that function is basically the only thing I dont like about the Pocket Camera.,bmpcc,d647dyu,1,t5_2ysye
8557513,0,t1_d4615gu,I was wondering how long have you had that setup HybridCamRev?  Im considering getting that as I already have the screws and several Sony batteries including the F which I assume would also work in that setup but Ive had so many external battery solutions stop working after a couple months and Ive heard mixed reviews about using the Sony .v batteries that Im scared to try anything new lol.,bmpcc,d6b9js0,1,t5_2ysye

11742917,0,t1_dgqeovt,gtISO  looks worse on the BMPCC.Nope  and  are cleaner than . Also changing your ISO does not affect your dynamic range. The camera will always capture the same range no matter what changing your ISO simply changes how that range gets interpreted. This is because the ISO is fixed at . You cannot actually shoot at anything OTHER than  unlike with film stocks where you can pick different sensitivities that do have different dynamic range properties.,bmpcc,dgr38e3,1,t5_2ysye
