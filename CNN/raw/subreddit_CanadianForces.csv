1685018,0,t1_cjrfzph,. Dont ever join the Reserves to get used to military life. A transfer from PRes to Reg can be done but it aint easy. The degree you have qualifies you for officer but the closer your degrees to the officer trade you want the more likely you are to get in.. There is some Reservebashing. Mostly its due to the experiences of the people involved. Since Reservist dont necessarily get trained on the same equipment and skills as Reg Force they can often be thrown into the deep end during deployments and exercises. As a result Reg force people see them unable to do things they regard as fundamental and deride their abilities. For the most part though the more time Reg force people have working with Reservists the more mutual respect there is.b. Pretty much. At its minimum Class A isnt really a big commitment. And in most cases the unit will accommodate reasonable requests..? Best for Network Tech would be Communications and Electronics Engineering Officer an air force trade. Philosophy wont help much specifically but it does work for the more general officer trades like Maritime Surface and SubSurface Officer or Infantry Officer but I cant promise youd get in.

I am therefore wondering if I am totally fucked in terms of enlisting? Will this disqualify me even if I make a full and healthy recovery? Please keep in mind that my surgery is next week and I wouldnt be joining up for about a year or two so there will be some good time in between. Im not sure if it makes a difference but the trades I am interested in are Armour Officer Artillery Officer and Aerospace Control Officer. I appreciate any and all advice  cheers. ,CanadianForces,cmggcq5,1,t5_2skgl

2801321,0,t3_2s477a,This is the site for RMCs Division of Continuing Studies.  It lays out the types of distance learning programs available to CF members.  The Bachelor of Military Arts and Science is a framework under which you can take distance learning courses through RMC  core credits  credits total  for honours program half must be military content as well as receiving equivalency credits for your military experience.  Some formal training that you do gets counted as credits.  For example POET counts as  Junior Science credits.  A CCC second language profile counts as  Junior and  Senior arts credits.  Deployments may be counted.  There is a fee to have your MPRR reviewed for course equivalencies.  Doing one course per semester is a workload that most people can handle easily with a little time management.  It makes the program a long term project but completely achievable.This is the site for submiting Individual Learning Plans.  You would be well advised to speak to your Personnel Selection Officer for advice first itll save you both some time if you get it right on the first try.  You put in an ILP explaining what the program of study is and how much it will cost per semester.  Once approved you register for the desired courses and pay for them.   Once you successfully complete the course you submit a claim to your PSOs office for reimbursement.  There is a cap on how much money you can claim through ILPs over the course of your career.  Discuss your goals with the PSO be aware that the amount of money available is finite.  Also each semester there are looming threats of budget cuts and partial reimbursements.  Get while the gettings good I guess.,CanadianForces,cnmi00d,3,t5_2skgl

Politically its a complete nonstarter and along with that come the logistical nightmares of parts and weapons sourcing interoperability with our NATO allies goes out the window or starts from scratch extremely costly if not completely unfeasible.  I mean...you dont want to be the chumps trying to buy some missiles or parts from the Russians to attack...something the Russians dont want you to attack.The Sukhoi PAKFA route is a complete nonstarter obviously.  I just meant to suggest that in terms of purpose of design and the broad operational capabilities the Russians are designing an aircraft that looks to me like it might fight the Canadian mission agenda a lot more neatly.For me i think those sort of capabilities and that very different design philosophy should considered as part of the F procurement.

The process is as mysterious to me as anyone else. Comms based jobs such as ACISS NCIOP Comma Research Intelligence all require you to have a top secret level security clearance by the time you complete your trades training or begin it. The verification process can take a long time and the top secret form requires a more extensive list of family. Again if you are concerned about family members affecting your eligibility bring it up with the clerks and the administration ladies during BMQ. They have a better idea of what to put.

Irving Shipbuilding is already working on AOPS they dont have hte capacity to start CSC or any other construction in the short to medium term. Seaspan on the west coast cant even handle the AORs for another three years. Mil Davie? They dont have the infrastructure to fast track construction. Soooooo if Mr Trudeau wants to fast track construction of any major navy platforms hes going to have to go outside Canada to build.  Saying hell fast track and expand capital acquisition is a lie.New Icebreakers and new surface combatants for the Navy? Isnt that what the current government is already doing? Whats different about the Trudeau promise? Whats he going to do thats different from whats already happening?Maintain current National Defence spending levels including current planned increases.  Maintain current spending levels? Hang on a second.... DND spending levels have been slashed over the last three years. DND is seriously underfunded at the moment and current funding levels will not pay for the capital acquisition that Mr Trudeau is promising.Immediately begin an open and transparent review process to create a new Defence White Paper that will replace Harpers failed Canada First Defence Strategy.An open and transparent review process?  Really? The Canada first  defence strategy failed not because it was a bad strategy but because it was unaffordable. Why was it unaffordable? Because defence has always been a low priority with both the Conservatives and Liberals. Bith have starved defence to either reduce the deficit or to pay for sexy election promises. There is nothing in the Canada First strategy that isnt needed. Launch an open and transparent competition to replace the CFs. We will not purchase the F stealth fighterbomber. This sounds a lot like Mr Chretiens election promise when he cancelled the EH  project. Look how long we had to wait  to finally get a replacement for the sea king helicopter.  Prioritize the acquisition of costeffective search and rescue aircraft.I distinctly remember Mr Trudeau criticising the current Government for trying to speed up acquisition. When it comes to capital acquisition there are no fast tracks unless you do what the Conservatives did with the C C CH and Leopard II. Is Mr Trudeau saying hed do the same thing?  Implement the recommendations made in the Canadian Forces Report on Transformation so that our Forces will be leaner more agile and betterequipped  with more teeth and less tail.Hes going to make us leaner? Holy fk man where are you going to cut to make us leaner?  Leaner  more cuts.End Canadas combat mission in Iraq. We will refocus Canadas military contribution in the region on the training of local forces.  Seems to me the Americans have been training Syrians by the boatload...hows that working out for them? How cost effective is that? How much has that cost them? Make new and significant investments to meet the sacred obligation that we have to our veterans.Arent you the guys who introduced the Veterans Charter in the first place?

Really fucking embarrassing if you ask me. Not getting the F is going to cost your country a shitload of cash. My home country is bailing on BAEs eurofighter for the F based off the price per unit alone.

A Sqn second in command can be considered a superior officer to the troop commanders.Commanding officers are one per unit there are no multiple tiers as suggested below at least not in the CF the US will call anyone a CO. COs are the legal authority for everything in a unit and have set powers as per the NDA and QRampOs. There was an OPME that covered this I just cant remember everything it had to say.Delegated officer is in my experienced used mainly in reference to the Code of Service Discipline and determining powers for summary trials. As above a CO is the authority for everything in a unit inclulding disciplinary matters and summary trials but they cant do it all themselves. Delegated officers are specifically appointed by the CO to handle certain disciplinary matters and have lesser powers of punishment. There are maximums to a delegated officers authority but the CO can reduce them if so desired.

How long are the regular contracts?    years?. Differences between someone who paid for their own university vs someone who got theirs paid by the gov.?. Does it help my resume for civil work after service? Do I get an edge over civilians or no?. Can I go to RangerSapper school if not what is an equivalent of it here in Canada?. Read the FAQ but is it really that hard to join the special forces or something thats more prestigestough to get into? I wish to push myself to the limit with signing up with something instead of relying on luck for getting hand picked since its a very low chance.. If I join regularreserves can I leave the army whenever I want?. If I were to enlist now how long would it take for them to reply? When would they send me to BMQ?I believe question  and  are kinda the same and worded weirdly but I hope my question gets across.,CanadianForces,cyyw6g6,-1,t5_2skgl

You could be right there are always people abusing the system and malingering.  I feel though this is the stigma that I talk about because I have heard it for years  I took it and nothing happend.  The probem is lariam is well tolerated in most individuals its not very effective as a preventative. The problem Im trying to address that some individuals will not tolerate it and when they do not tolerate it were not talking about just a little dizzy or just a bit light headed.  The effects are extremely dangerous and neurotoxic.  The same as someone with PTSD isnt just having nightmares they are experience a very serious disorder that impacts their life.  If this happens while in theater there is no help because as you describe many believe it is just hysteria.  For myself my section relied on me to remain situationally aware and I wasnt. I couldnt get help from the MIR because like you said the effects were just hyped so people could get out of trouble if I choose to push it further I would be viewed as malingering to get out of tour. instead I was left in theater suffering from panic attacks and dissasociative episodes while also searching for IEDs and other indicators it wasnt a good time.,CanadianForces,d1otsdg,2,t5_2skgl

7710659,0,t1_d3ie0y1,gtThe problem is how theyre dealt with. My experience and apparently some others is that the accused is immediately taken off course stuck in a corner or removed from the general population until the investigation if there is any is concluded. Being removed from a course or having your career frozen does more than just make someone mad.Because of the nature of the allegation. I know a dude who was accused of possession of child porn by a course mate and he was taken into custody by the MPs within minutes of the allegation. Well before the course staff had looked into it or an investigation had even begun. Same with that Colonel accused of molesting children  he was suspended from all duties pending the investigation because the accusation was serious enough that he could place other people at risk. gtFalse accusations will always happen but we cant treat the accused like lepers while an investigation is taking place. It breeds the discontent that you see in this thread.So if someone was accused of child molestation or assault causing bodily harm or another equally serious offence would you advocate leaving them in their job until charges were laid? gtI find this very disturbing if it was posted here.It was repeatedly. Have always been accused of making it up any time Ive posted anything. gtAlso what punishments did they receive? I hope that the new investigation mandate will help build cases against real perpetrators allowing just punishments to be rendered.One was told quietly to stop. No paperwork no punishment no record.

The number of well trained troops that get out of the army because no one cares about them and they get fucked around is astonishing. This is killing our retention and driving us deeper into the bare minimum standard training cycle. I spent a long time in the reserves and I watched it more than get cut in half to the point most units went into lowest common denominator survival mode. What Im seeing now in the Regs is the front end of this. Trained troops are valuable in terms of training budgets operational capacity and flexibility. Losing them because someone is more concerned about updating a tracker or going home early is destroying our ability to get the job done.Look after your troops. No matter what else is going on or what demands there are on your time. They are fucking people. The difference between a Cpl getting out or resigning doing  years and becoming a WO is sometimes someone actually giving a fuck about them when it was inconvenient. The army cant fucking function without soldiers and its time people understood this. If you look after your troops and train and mentor them they will surprise you with how much they get done. The solution for being triple hatted is right under the noses of most leaders but they are too worried about not looking bad to see it.Edit well it appears that was a rantrant mode off,CanadianForces,d3tv7jq,2,t5_2skgl

In otherwords somethings fuckyYou immediately reply with gt it may just mean their entry plan or trade is hiring sooner so their application is higher priority. Or that their CFRC has less of a backlog or their medical staff isnt away on leave or anything in between.Excuse the cherry picking of your arguement but.gt gt Or that their CFRC has less of a backlog or their medical staff isnt away on leave or anything in between.If medical is on leave or even anything in between my application is not being processed and would explain a discrepancy in me Vs someone on the east coast for example.Mine being POSTPONED in this case due to medical enjoying some leave.Im going to use your analogy to get this back on track.Perhaps some have lanes faster than mine in the case of ROTP but I am not talking about them here I am talking about the Medical staff on leave example being a construction crew slowing me down to kmhYou are getting needlessly hostile and frustrated by thinking about this in terms of others going faster. If you can look at this from my perspective I dont have the knowledge you very clearly do None of what you are saying is answering my original question.I asked what speeds are similar cars going. And your answer was No that question is unanswerable your car couldnt possibly go slower other people are faster but yours is fast too and it doesnt matter hurry up and wait.Im trying to learn if I am a longer applicant or a shorter one based on what others experience so I can take care of matters in my life like a responsible adult and you are neither supportive of the original question nor are you taking the time consider YOU arent getting it.Thank you for your time.

8454249,0,t1_d5xxs27,gt Ive never found ANY proF arguments. It really depends on where you look. Some places are definitely better informed than others even if were just talking about reddit.gt What about the trillions in initial and maintenance costsThere are no trillions in initial and maintenance costs. The entire F program for the United States is estimated at over one trillion dollars when you factor in both development procurement and sustainment over the total program life of  years and  aircraft with inflation factored in. Sustainment cost is the full cost of operating the aircraft to include everyones pay and the jets fuel so its a huge number for any fleet the size of the F.gt that it doesnt do counterinsurgencystyle CAS as well durability longevity payload variety as an AWell first off understand that the F is designed to be the backbone of US and NATO airforces for the next  years. Your backbone your mass the largest single model of aircraft you have needs to be flexible and capable not pigeon holed into a niche role thats bombing terrible people who has little air defence capabilities. Since the USAFs other fighters and bombers make up the greater portion of CAS in the current COIN operations the F simply follows an ongoing phasing out of As. Since the COIN generally involve little opposing air defences durability is not a real concern. Soon as there are any indication of credible MANPAD threats the As arent going to be doing much low level work either as even older MANPADs downed  As during ODS and damaged many more. With todays sensors getting down low to see the target isnt as important or even as effective depending on the situation. A lot of A fratricide against US and allied troops were done by eyes in plain daylight with no one shooting at the As. Food for thought. Theres no longevity left to the A. Theyre very old and werent designed to carry much in the way of electronics whether defensive or offensive. If the argument were a costeffectiveness one for plinking murderous assholes mostly armed with AKs and VBIEDs there are better solutions than even the A. And ultimately nothing about the A makes or breaks a COIN campaign.By sheer payload weight the FA carries more. By variety the F can carry newer weapons SDB I JSOW more to come while the A can carry some of the older stuff Maverick rockets. For the current mainstays of CAS JDAMs and Paveways the  are evenly match... Except that the F can bomb through very low clouds with its JDAM and radar combination while the A has no radar. gt how stealth planes were shot down even going back to Serbia bombing campaignOnly  stealth plane not planes has ever been shot down to date and that was a F. The F being the first stealth combat aircraft had very little in the way of situational awareness since back then they were unable to make low observable antennas. This meant that the F had no radar warning receiver which meant that the pilot never realized he was flying directly at a SAM system even as the SAMs radar was groping around for him. The Serbs realized that the USAF was reusing routes and schedule for their aircraft and parked part of a SAM battery right in the Fs path. Even then the F had to fly almost into MANPAD range before the radarguided SAM could get enough of a radar return to engage and the first shot missed. So while its possible to repeat the mistake of reusing flight plans the technological weakness that enabled the rest of the shoot down isnt applicable to any other stealth aircraft today. ,CanadianForces,d5ybelf,2,t5_2skgl

9605410,0,t3_5cec9r,In roughly decreasing order of importance Job stability. My father had rather shitty luck jobwise when I was growing up. Hed get a position and fast forward a few years thered be a downturn in the industry and hed get caught in a round of layoffs or the company would fold outright etc. He generally landed on his feet but I wont pretend that it wasnt stressful. The military offers what is pretty much the most rock solid job stability in the country. Good benefits package. Especially ample annual leave. Far more than you can expect to get pretty much anywhere in the private sector. The gold plated pension. Plus the medical and dental coverage is also pretty damned good. I mean after years of trying to find one my wife finally has a family doctor but it takes a few months lead time to get in to see her. The last time I tried to make an appointment to see mine for a non acute issue it was within a week. Plus other factors like being able to go to the gym during work hours occasional mess functions etc. Decent pay. Dont get me wrong I probably could have been making a bit more if I had stuck with the private sector in my home province of Alberta but that comes along with the whole job stability thing mentioned above. The CAF offers a good balance of pay versus other factors. Its not like I would have been making double or triple or anything like that. Some sort of vague desire to do a job serving my country  or some other sort of work thats fulfilling etc. Honestly this is the one where expectations are probably furthest from reality. The degree to which this job is personally fulfilling really is only sometimes there. Most days its just a job. Im not here for some burning desire to make the Navy my life. Ive known some who do... and honestly its kinda sad. But if I was here raring to go every day to try and make a massive impact on the world... eh some sort of NGO might  be a better option than being middle management in a semi technical role.Anyways. The reason that I am still in is because I havent come across any other positions elsewhere for which I am qualified which would better fit my needs.

If they flew faster theyd have build in a fuel stop earlier.Conversely if they flew out fast max long range cruise for a long range mission they might have to consider leaving some of the SAR kit behind.The aircraft was an utter compromise all around.  There were only two aircraft that we studied that could fly long range at high speed and arrive on station with a full payload and enough endurance.  That the was the Spartan and the Herc.  The Embraer aircraft wasnt on offer yet...that might be a capable airplane too.With this airplane we will have lower response times in some regions and without the endurance to stay on scene there will be missions where victims suffer.

I would have joined as a CF musician had the entry process been the way it used to be. And I absolutely loved going as a kid to watch my dad play gigs even the jazz ensemble stuff that was mostly SinatraEllington and attended by  senior citizens. He worked with Ray M. when they were both Sgts lol Some time ago I saw a video on FB floating around shared by an FB friend of a friend who was a CF musician of a bassoonist playing on stage with an accompanist. If its you then I seriously envy your talent. For what its worth when he wore a regimental cap badge as a musician at a unit that shut down in the FRP  yrs ago and they rehearsed next door to the shacks the guys lived in they experienced similar levels of hate and disdain from the combat arms guys who wore the same cap badge who said the bandies were primadonna pseudoSgts. Id like to think the navy with the band there for all the ships homecomings is not like that quite as much if at all. They never cared what the grunts thought about them. His theory better to be drinking beer while playing a tattoo in Europe than doing army things though playing army Wainwright once every few years was a nice break from the normal routine. If anything it made the band very tightknit as the base never cared about them. Whereas in a place like Winnipeg you knew the air force always had your back and you were appreciated. Similar to the navy Id think.Have a wonderful Christmas and I hope the restructure gets sorted out to your benefit! The flight line life isnt any better some days for what its worth.
