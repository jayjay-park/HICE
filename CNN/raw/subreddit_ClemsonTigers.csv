In  he had  punts inside the  without a touchback this year he had  inside the  with  touchbacks.From what I see he kicked  extra points against an FCS team and  against FSU but no field goals in a game.  He did do kickoffs and did fine kicking into the endzone consistently.,ClemsonTigers,ct1mhot,2,t5_2sazd
