1161975,0,t3_27fmuq,Sounds like the beginning of Seed of ChuckygtThe movie begins from Glens point of view as a little girl named Claudia unwraps her birthday gift only to find a hideous looking doll in it that she doesnt like. Her parents agree and decide to throw it down in the cellar for the night. Late at night Glen comes out of the cellar grabs the knife out of the birthday cake and slowly sneaks up the stairs. Claudias father sees him standing next to the bathroom and thinks she has left her toys out again. Claudia claims innocence but as her father continues to lecture Glen stabs him making him fall over the railing to his death. He then goes inside the bathroom where her mother is. She is stabbed by Glen causing her fall out of the bathtub and split her head open on the floor. Next he goes into Claudias room and pulls back the covers on the bed only to see a doll sleeping there. He stabs it in anger as Claudia comes out accusing him of killing her parents. She then tells him hes pissing his pants to where he wakes up with his feet soaked in urine to find out it was all a dream. He is locked in a cage in a circus somewhere in England and his mean owner then takes him out to perform his ventriloquist act with Glen being called Shiftace. In a voiceover Glen tells the audience that he doesnt know who he is or why he had these nightmares but that he really wants to know where his parents are.,tipofmytongue,ci0caem,2,t5_2r4oc

1221811,0,t3_281bx4,I strongly doubt this tune is from a game as itd need to be licensed. That said it sounds really familiar. You pieced this together yourself? Like in a sequencer? My memory is very unreliable over long periods of time for that reason Im going to make the appropriate assumption that yours is as well. Theres a lot of songs I once listened toor even performed and think that they were very different from how they actually sound. Could it be that you borrowed other elements from other pieces when rebuilding this one? Ive heard music that sounds like other music and then my memory of the two can sometimes blend together.  Honestly your best bet might be finding your middle school band instructorpossibly email them and ask what you guys played. Supply them with the file youve made saying it sounded like this. Not only would they be ecstatic that youre still into the creation of music but they probably have the pieces they played documented somewhere as well. If you do ask report back because I really wanna know the name of this song now because it sounds like something Ive heard before. ,tipofmytongue,ci72lwo,1,t5_2r4oc

The point of the video being shown in the CS lecture was that the optimal strategy was to guess a high number then guess exactly halfway between that number and zero and so on guessing halfway points until the price is found.So it was neither Cliff Hanger nor Hi Lo,tipofmytongue,ckfiujp,1,t5_2r4oc

How many instruments were in the song? Was it a band? Solo singer with a back up band? Could you dance to it? Was it mopey? Was it happy? Could you do it in a box? Perhaps wearing socks? Was it from someone still famous? One hit wonder? Do you remember who the artistband looked like?? Would a rapper of guested on the song or perhaps on the remix? Was there a remix? When do you first remember hearing the song? Has it been covered?

He was nervous and said that he wasnt sure what was available. The madame told him that she had just the girl for him. The girl led him to the room and they both undressed. She told him that he would just love . They started to go at it when the girl rips a fart right in his face. She apologized and blamed it on the Mexican food she just had. They go back at it and she lets go with the nastiest fart ever. Again she apologized and said that this had never happened to her before.

Where?Gone from my sight m that is all.She is just as large in the masts hull and spars as she was when I saw herAnd just as able to bear her load of living freight to its destination.The diminished size and total loss of sight is in menot in her.And just at the moment when someone at my side saysShe is gone There are others who are watching her coming and other voices take up a glad shoutThere she comes and that is dying.

His meaning was more personal.. Angst is an unfocused one about the human condition or the state of the world in general. More than that there is a heavy prejudice against the word angst because it is seen as whiny self centered and juvenile in popular culture.It could also simply be your perceived arrogance at assuming it was solved... ,tipofmytongue,co2pn3y,4,t5_2r4oc

3107694,0,t3_2vp1i0,I just did it and Im not sure I agree wholly with this You Have Bitten the Bulletgt In saying that God has the freedom and power to do that which is logically impossible such as creating square circles you are saying that any discussion of God and ultimate reality cannot be constrained by basic principles of rationality. This would seem to make rational discourse about God impossible. If rational discourse about God is impossible there is nothing rational we can say about God and nothing rational we can say to support our belief or disbelief in God. To reject rational constraints on religious discourse in this fashion requires accepting that religious convictions including your own religious convictions are beyond any debate or rational discussion. This is to bite a bullet.Its not that if God squared circles that I abandoned logic and rationality its just that the rules of logic and rationality changed. Besides Question  God can change logical rules of the universe is an unwinable trap when combined with Question  God is omnipotent If you answer Yes to  you get the above comment. If you answer Yes to  and No to  youve just agreed that God is both omnipotent yet not powerful enough to change logical rules of the universe a contradiction. If you answer No to  to avoid that contradiction you say that God isnt omnipotent which I think brings up some issues not discussed by this test. Plus a God of limited power isnt much of a God is it?,tipofmytongue,cok40rr,5,t5_2r4oc

Id also had an inkling the billionaire roommate was from eBay but Wikipedia had Pierre Omidyar as founder whose pic didnt match my memory.  I clearly remembered the scene where the guy gets out of his POS red car but I always thought it was Jeff Bezos which I could never reconcile to the rest of the details.  If only Id scrolled down the wiki page I would have found the right Jeff.Still dont think I would have come up with your search string or ever found the video so again  gold well deserved!Now off to scour through K comments in that white whale thread to see if I can help ,tipofmytongue,crxqqzw,2,t5_2r4oc

4495287,0,t3_3cnji0,English poet David Whyte has said this several ways in several places.  This column  looks like the original gtPoetry is often the art of overhearing yourself say things you didnt know you knew. It is a learned skill to force yourself to articulate your life your present world or your possibilities for the future. We need that same skill as an art of survival. We need to overhear the tiny but very consequential things we say that reveal ourselves to ourselves.Also in this interview gtIn reading to audiences its an elaboration of the original art form almost a secondary emanation of the original writing. Forcing your self in effect to overhear yourself say things in a room full of people. Thats one of the central art forms of poetry on the lonely page also overhearing yourself say things in the silence you didnt know you knew. In this interview gtThe understanding is that there is a conversational nature to reality I suppose. So in other words whatever you want to happen will not happen. But equally whatever the world wants to happen for you will not happen either. And what happens is this meeting. And its in that meeting that you overhear yourself being surprised by your reality by the larger context that you havent yet explored. So youre trying to overhear your self whom you didnt know you knew. And youre trying to speak it out loud in the world so it can be known consciously. There should be a lovely sense of surprise when youre working at that edge and a sense of being gifted.rTextDetectives !,tipofmytongue,csxae8s,1,t5_2r4oc

The other thing I remember was that when the other detective would ask a question the camera would shake side to side for a no and up and down for a yes. At the end of the show I think you were given three options on what could have happened and it asked you to make your choice before the commercial break. After that it would reveal what actually happened. The only other thing I remember was years later I saw the actor I linked to previously showing up in a bunch of Cohen Brothers movies and remembering him from this weird show. I distinctly remember him wearing nothing but a towel and arguing with the partner. Sound familiar? ,tipofmytongue,cz3te5g,1,t5_2r4oc

Im holding One Of Those Hideous Books Where The Mother Dies by Sonya Sones. The girl Ruby moves to LA when her mother dies to live with her famous actor dad who shes never met as far as she knows names Whip Logan and if I Tell you more itll spoil the story. She goes to a school called Lakewood where she meets a girl named Colette but their Dream Interpretation teacher is called Feather. Also its told in poems bc thats Sonya Sones thing.Again Im not sure this is what youre after and the cover doesnt match but I know the story youre talking about and this somewhat similar one was handy on the shelf.,tipofmytongue,d092on4,1,t5_2r4oc

7044933,0,t3_4c3mqo,From your comment it sounds like maybe youre looking for a movie but it reminded me of this viral missed connection I read a while ago. Its one of my favorite things.I saw you on the Manhattanbound Brooklyn Q train.I was wearing a bluestriped tshirt and a pair of maroon pants. You were wearing a vintage red skirt and a smart white blouse. We both wore glasses. I guess we still do.You got on at DeKalb and sat across from me and we made eye contact briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person youre looking at and fall in love with that person. But still I think there was something there.Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you  maybe pretend I didnt know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your bootshaped earrings or just say Hot day. It all seemed so stupid.At one point I caught you staring at me and you immediately averted your eyes. You pulled a book out of your bag and started reading it  a biography of Lyndon Johnson  but I noticed you never once turned a page.My stop was Union Square but at Union Square I decided to stay on rationalizing that I could just as easily transfer to the  at nd Street but then I didnt get off at nd Street either. You must have missed your stop as well because when we got all the way to the end of the line at Ditmars we both just sat there in the car waiting.I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.Still I said nothing.We took the train all the way back down  down through Astoria across the East River weaving through midtown from Times Square to Herald Square to Union Square under SoHo and Chinatown up across the bridge back into Brooklyn past Barclays and Prospect Park past Flatbush and Midwood and Sheepshead Bay all the way to Coney Island. And when we got to Coney Island I knew I had to say something.Still I said nothing.And so we went back up.Up and down the Q line over and over. We caught the rush hour crowds and then saw them thin out again. We watched the sun set over Manhattan as we crossed the East River. I gave myself deadlines Ill talk to her before Newkirk Ill talk to her before Canal. Still I remained silent.For months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands had our faces nearly kicked in by a hundred thousand break dancers. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of singles. When the train went above ground Id get text messages and voicemails Where are you? What happened? Are you okay? until my phone ran out of battery.Ill talk to her before daybreak Ill talk to her before Tuesday. The longer I waited the harder it got. What could I possibly say to you now now that weve passed this same station for the hundredth time? Maybe if I could go back to the first time the Q switched over to the local R line for the weekend I could have said Well this is inconvenient but I couldnt very well say it now could I? I would kick myself for days after every time you sneezed  why hadnt I said Bless You? That tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation but here in stupid silence still we sat.There were nights when we were the only two souls in the car perhaps even on the whole train and even then I felt selfconscious about bothering you. Shes reading her book I thought she doesnt want to talk to me. Still there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Jesus and wed immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit holding hands and wed both think Young Love.For sixty years we sat in that car just barely pretending not to notice each other. I got to know you so well if only peripherally. I memorized the folds of your body the contours of your face the patterns of your breath. I saw you cry once after youd glanced at a neighbors newspaper. I wondered if you were crying about something specific or just the general passage of time so unnoticeable until suddenly noticeable. I wanted to comfort you wrap my arms around you assure you I knew everything would be fine but it felt too familiar I stayed glued to my seat.One day in the middle of the afternoon you stood up as the train pulled into Queensboro Plaza. It was difficult for you this simple task of standing up you hadnt done it in sixty years. Holding onto the rails you managed to get yourself to the door. You hesitated briefly there perhaps waiting for me to say something giving me one last chance to stop you but rather than spit out a lifetime of suppressed almostconversations I said nothing and I watched you slip out between the closing sliding doors.It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the subway car sit down next to me rest your head on my shoulder. Nothing would be said. Nothing would need to be said.When the train returned to Queensboro Plaza I craned my neck as we entered the station. Perhaps you were there on the platform still waiting. Perhaps I would see you smiling and bright your long gray hair waving in the wind from the oncoming train.But no you were gone. And I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for sixty years and yet still not really know that person at all.I stayed on the train until it got to Union Square at which point I got off and transferred to the L.,tipofmytongue,d1ewg0h,4,t5_2r4oc

I can say that there are no objective truths and the holocaust is an historical reality because even if objective truths are not something I feel can be known people will obviously still come up with their own perceptions based off their life experiences.For example you will find plenty of humans wholl say I dont think anyone can truly know if there are gods but my personal opinion is that there arentthere are. I dont find this contradictory either. The word reality only implies objectivity if one is an objectivist about the nature of reality. For a philosophical quiz I think itd be kind of bizarre to act like idealists and subjectivists dont exist. Like the other poster said the test is very black and white and does reveal the authors own opinions on some phisosophical matters.,tipofmytongue,d1l4q0i,1,t5_2r4oc

7188861,0,t1_d1vadng,Back around  or so it was somewhat common for either a clan or sometimes a single person with tons of money to pick a somewhat common item maybe ranarr seeds or whips or something and spend a few weeks buying up as many as possible. Since the GE prices were based on supply and demand the prices would rise pretty high sometimes double or triple the original price. They would then sell off the stockpile quickly usually a matter of hours and would make a decent profit. I never participated in any of it but I had friends in clans who did it pretty regularly. I havent played since around  so I dont know if this still happens or if the current trading system even allows for it.,tipofmytongue,d1vb8w8,2,t5_2r4oc

8446574,0,t1_d5xcb2g,Its a reference to a mathematical logic puzzle. A farmer is trying to carry in this variant a fox a chicken and a cabbage across a river. But he can only carry one in his boat at a time and if he leaves them alone at any point the chicken will eat the cabbage and the fox will eat the chicken. The puzzle is for the farmer to figure out how to get all three across the river safely.I love the ending because its so ambiguous. Why is the mother thinking about the puzzle and its solution? Is it a cynical recognition that foxes will always eat chickens  that thats just how the world is like an ironclad logical axiom? Or is it about the hope that even if you accept that constraint people can still solve the puzzle and find ways to coexist? Are we doomed without the farmer or can we be farmers ourselves?,tipofmytongue,d5xcxz4,3,t5_2r4oc

Im not  positive thats what I saw but having looked at a few YouTube videos of the show now that youve provided a name it seems to be pretty consistent with the theme so thats most likely it?  Any chance theres anything else thats very closesimilar to this?  As for hair style I think it was short and spunky looking.  Thanks!,tipofmytongue,d90wkw2,1,t5_2r4oc
