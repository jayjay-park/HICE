Your mind is recognizing a distinction in the world for the first time and learning there is something to be gained by paying attention to it. Both can take time. It is a learningtraining process.If you are in the best user effectiveness categories this might happen instantaneously but the condition is very subtle in a lot of ways. Many if not most redgreen color blind people can see green but it is all the greens now available to them which is different.,EnChromaSupport,cu0qqk8,1,t5_39g6y
4859025,0,t3_3hftw4,Hi! Thanks for stopping in!Red and green colorblindness is actually the most common form of colorblindness anything more than that is pretty rare. Most colorblindness is just a malfunction of one sets of cones in your eyes they essentially overlap in terms of what theyre trying to see making greens and reds difficult to distinguish at times. However protanopia is a little different. Chances are that your red cones are malfunctioning to an extreme which as a protan means youre filtering out a significant amount of reds. Have you taken the EnChroma test yet Thatll give you a rough estimate of how effective the glasses will be for you. Take the test and let me know what you get. If youre protanopia theres a real chance the glasses may not be effective for you.What Ill say is that the most wow effect anybody is going to get from the glasses is going to be from the CXs the darkest of the glasses. On a bright day it produces the strongest enhancements.,EnChromaSupport,cu70lob,1,t5_39g6y
5494273,0,t1_cu0evl4,Hi I hope its alright if I ask you some questions. My dad tested as a moderate protan and Im trying to select something for him. Did you get cxs? Would you recommend those? Also has it made a difference indoors? He loves going to the museum and it would just make my life if I could improve those colours for him.,EnChromaSupport,cwdy1d4,1,t5_39g6y
