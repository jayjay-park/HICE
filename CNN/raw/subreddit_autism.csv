312901,0,t3_1xmfw6,The purpose of a hiring process is to identify the candidate you perceive to be the most likely to be productive in your work environment  not the most qualified. Its why being overqualified can be a negative. If one has all the qualifications in the world but is unlikely to get along with their coworkers or enjoy their job they should not get the job. Hiring based purely on qualifications risks negatively impacting the productivity of your current staff if a new hire is unlikely to fit in. This has nothing to do with discrimination and is simply common sense.Now if they were asking very specific questions to try to figure out if someone has an ASD and screened out a person if the person answered as if they did that would be.

If his functioning is not contrary to their expectations then they dont see a need for medical help.  Addressing a problem with the expectation is different than addressing a problem with their perception of the childs functioning and they may have bothIt sounds to me like this is a situation where the parents will eventually recognise the need for some services. The goal is to eventually have raised an adult who is as independent as possible. Early  identification of these issues helps but the lack of it will not be an insurmountable barrier.

We love being with each other and doing things together.But what Ive seen on the fringes of the Autism community is a lot of people being angry and judgemental about how other people who they may or may not know try to understand cope with interact with or describe Autism in those around them or themselves.  I havent personally witnessed much in the way of support or encouragement except from my coworker with the older boy or from our sons teachers and therapists.In the same way that perceiving and interacting with the world around them can be challenging to those with Autism  those of us without it werent given a manual to prepare for having it in our lives either.  We rely on the love we feel for our family members and our best intentions in trying to understand and respond to the situation to help us be the best we can for those in our lives who are living with this first hand.

1204160,0,t3_27wjo4,We use PRT with our daughter.  Basically we get on the floor with her and follow her lead the whole goal being to open the door for appropriate communication opportunities.  If she loses interest in whatever shes playing with we move with her to whatever shes interested.Example shes playing with a toy that plays music.  We turn it to Off and take control of that part of the toy until she can say without yellingscreaming something like turn it on please.  We would model prompt the first time and say turn it on please. and basically wait until she says that.  The second time she wants it on we dont even model prompt because we know that she knows she needs to ask us.  So we basically wait her out until she asks it of course doesnt have to be exactly that phrase at that point just any appropriate way to ask.Or we would ask openended questions like I love this car I like to drive it back and  and wait for her to finish that statement with forth or anything that would make sense.Weve moved from that to now getting her to work on imaginative play and sharing to prep her for kindergarten with her peers.  So we play with her princess castle and pick up a princess toy we know she loves best and likes to hold.  She might get frustrated and really really want that toy but we hold out until she can ask appropriately.When she can go that far we might say sure Ill share in a minute but Im playing with it right now why dont you play with this one?  Were not trying to make her angry it sounds like it is just trying to mirror what shell see with other kids so she can interact with others socially.We go through SARRC in AZ amp they set the above kinds of goals for us initially when training us on PRT after working withobserving our daughter and her needs she would get very easily frustrated and melt down if there was any alteration to her play routine.  So the goals for your son might be different but mainly its focused on following their lead making it like play and staying calm.  If your son is anything like our daughter its all about motivation.  If she really wants something shes going to stop think it over and go for it.And this part isnt really PRT but her therapists stress this so much with everything ignore bad behavior.  Our daughter was very prone to tantrums because she knew it got our attention.  If she wants something from us now she can kick scream cry yell but she is not going to get it until she calms down and asks for it calmly.  Were not even going to talk to her or make eye contact until she calms down.  If shes yelling and takes even two seconds to breathe well reinforce that behavior by saying thanks so much for calming down can you tell me what you want like a big girl?That goes for situations and this one is hard because people judge you and I know theyre thinking why cant they control their kid? in public like in the grocery store.  If she is acting up because shes bored and wants to leave I will drag her through that entire store with me rather than take her out.Her tantruming is almost completely gone for the above.  She knows it will get her nowhere and we can actually see her stop take a deep breathe and try a better way.This was a novel.  Im sorry.I found a link to a ppt on it  ,autism,ci533yx,10,t5_2qhs6

I remember all the way back when I was just a little baby and couldnt walk. My mom tells me that I cant remember way back then but she is wrong I remember. I dont know why I was how I was or why I am how I am now I just thank god that Im not how I used to be. It was scary and lonely and hard to explain but I remember everything.If you know someone who is lowfunctioning like I used to be tell them you love them and tell them that you will pray for them.

1609005,0,t3_2clzwa,What harmed me as a child was not getting feedback on why my behavior was off around other children. I got plenty of feedback when I did things wrong but very little or no feedback on why what I did was wrong or what I should do instead of the wrong thing. This wasnt helped that I appeared to be older than I was due to a large vocabulary and being raised to be very polite. Another thing would have been help in how to handle bullies. I was picked on from kindergarten up to high school it would have been nice to have had some help in how to handle those situations. And to have people who would ask because I didnt understand that this wasnt normal and that I might be able to ask for help.What helped and continues to help is finding mentors people who are willing to explain things to me put up with my odd behaviors and still accept me as I am. This has helped me to start building up some self confidence and to be a bit more comfortable with who I am.For caregivers just understand that there is a person inside who cares and may know theyve done something wrong but they dont have a clue as to what it was.

Its understandably shocking but kids are trying to figure themselves out and they dont have the experience to reason their way through some situations or put it in a frame of reference. Add to that a lack of ability to read social cues and things like this will happen. If you can look into getting some professional help.

2281989,0,t3_2lberg,Turns out as a kid I had chronic inflammation and leaky gut from an honesttogod casein and  gluten intolerance. A month after they were both out of my diet other food mostly felt OK again.  I had trouble digesting all food until like age  when I finally figured out the casein part I have celiac so I was gluten free at .  Once the inflammation died down it was heaven  I could eat so many new foods without problems.I never told my mother any of this growing up. Never occurred to me. All kinds of gastrointestinal stuff going on.  The weird part is I sort of hated some foods without consciously knowing why.  Now I know why I threw tantrums about eating waffles. Removing these is worth a shot.  But if that doesnt help within a month...lets just say macncheese is delicious and no kid should grow up without it if at all possible. ,autism,cltrrzy,1,t5_2qhs6

2336347,0,t3_2m2k08,There is no such thing as mild Autism However adults without language or intellectual disabilities as adults are often socially awkward but they have lived long enough to find their own place in many areas. They may eat dress or act oddly and have very strong interests.Their social lives may be simple or they may be troublesome depending on their choices. Adults with ASD generally seem to have the most issues when it concerns other people rather than trouble by themselves.

He is almost  and really only gets a few things that have been said approximately  times to him.  For instance he was treating his seat belt like a joke and taking it off on the school van and doing freaking handstands on the floor and such. Then they put him in a harness...  Houdini time!   Then they started buying more and more restraints...more fun with Houdini practice!  My only currency with him is his youtube addiction with cartoons like the wiggles and other godforsaken kids programs so I decided to try to communicate with him for months and turn the internet off if he didnt stay in his seat.....didnt get it.  I talked and talked until I was blue in the face and even got his understanding so far as he would go in my car in the garage after the bus left and put it on in there when he discovered the internet was off.  I had the teacher make pictures to show seat belt on  internet.... no seat belt   not found.  Boom!  He got it.  One day of rebellion then the seat belt on after being Houdini for over a year and me turning the internet off for about  months and trying to show him in other ways what the rules were.  ,autism,cmfydaj,2,t5_2qhs6

2553504,0,t3_2oz3as,In my opinion an adult diagnosis is primarily about two things if youre not using it to apply for any sort of social services. First its about validation of your own suspicions and putting an end to the self doubt that a lot of us struggle with when were exploring our place on the spectrum on our own. Second its a communication tool that can help with disclosure and stave off some but not all of the doubt and suspicion that youre likely to receive disclosing a self diagnosis.So to answer your question in those ways it was helpful for me to get my diagnosis. However contrary to umaullys feelings in my experience the diagnosis process was not terribly informative for understanding how I interact with the world. Most of the deeper understanding that I have achieved regarding the spectrum and my place on it has come from long hours of research and serious introspection along with increased awareness of how Im responding to situations in the moment.Lastly you should understand that getting an adult diagnosis is not necessarily easy or straightforward. Opinions on what constitute being autistic will vary from one mental health professional to another especially at the higher functioning end of the spectrum. If you do seek it you should probably be prepared to make your own case about why you suspect that youre on the spectrum. Youll likely have more success with an accurate diagnosis if you seek out someone who specializes in ASD diagnosis and has experience with high functioning adults.,autism,cmrvore,3,t5_2qhs6

I shared him the link and he didnt disagree with it.  I have no reason to dismiss it  at most I can now say that there is a lot of variance with autism that affects people differently.  What I can say for sure is that my friends life would be better if he didnt have this.  Its done him no favors.  So please dont pretend that there isnt a problem either.  He cant connect or understand the world in the same way others can.  This affects his ability to make friends keep friends find work etc. Hes missing out on an aspect of life in a similarmuch greater vein to say a color blind person.

If youre  and it hasnt happened by now it wont just because they finally write down the name of the condition youve always had.gtNo college ever considering me a real candidate? You dont need to disclose your status on an application.  Your medical records go to the campus doctors and they are not allowed to share the contents with any admissions personnel  doing so is a HIPAA violation which is Serious Business in the field of healthcare.gton record for any employer insurance agent doctor or college adminOnly the middle two have any chance of seeing that information of their own accord and the doctors should see it because its an informative statement about your neurology that could inform treatment decisions.  An employer or school administrator will only know your status if you disclose it to them e.g. for the purpose of getting an ADA accommodation.Alsogt I know my parents will never accept a diagnosis. My mom will say theyll do anything to put kids on meds.Theres no medication specifically approved for the indication of autism so thats a verifiably false statement.  Medication is only used for treating particular symptoms none of which is specific to autism on its own.  Even being foolishly opposed to medication on a categorical level doesnt entirely negate the utility of a diagnosis because you can still get ADA accommodations that arent pharmacological in the first place.gtBut getting a diagnosis terrifies me? I mean what if Im wrong? Given the presentation you describe you wont look stupid for being wrong.  Somebody who goes in for being mildly socially awkward and calls it autism because thats what they depict on TV looks stupid.  Someone who presents with a history of sensory hypersensitivity nonverbal tendencies and repetitive behavior is raising a valid question and wont be criticized at all.

Are there any local support groups for parents of children with autism or special needs in your area? There likely are ones that meet weekly or monthly for free and it really sounds as though it would be of great benefit to you to help you move beyond this despair and anger. There will be struggles yes but there will also be victories and finding other families to share your special victories as well as share strategies and just vent can really help you leave many of these negative feelings behind  and I call them negative not because youre bad for having them or unjustified but right now anger and resentment and despair are not helping you and you need to find a way to move beyond them.  Im also a mom of two children with autism  and  so it sounds as though we have the same age split. I think I was able to accept our eldest daughters autism better because of the support group I found  when your friends and neighbors have all NT kids you dont really have anyone to celebrate your special victories and truly commiserate with at the same level and that can be extremely isolating which just feeds into the why me? thinking. ,autism,cqd3tg1,6,t5_2qhs6

3903684,0,t3_355qj6,There are a few possibilities. Being autistic there is a good possibility that you have alexythimia  an inability to recognise your own emotions to a certain extent. Your feeling that you lack attachment to people might be because on an emotional level you dont know you are experiencing it. Try to see if you can identify your feelings through rational thought how do you treat your girlfriend compared to other people. Another possibility is that your depression is interfering. Depression dampens all emotions and might make you feel less in love. When the depression is gone you might feel more emotions. You could also be overwhelmed. Especially when dealing with things like depression it is easy to not feel in control of your life. By pushing out everything that is going on or involved in your life you regain control. Perhaps you need space to deal with yourself and to get back in touch with yourself. This doesnt mean the relationship needs to end just that you could use physical space for yourself. Most importantly however talk to your girlfriend. Let her know that you feel overwhelmed and that you feel that sometimes you are not treating her well. Communicate with her and make her feel involved. She most likely has noticed something is off and preempting questions will make her feel more at ease. She can also help more easily. Theres a good possibility things will get better with cbt. It is a good method and works in a lot of cases. I hope this helped and good luck! ,autism,cr195gu,5,t5_2qhs6

My little fella loves YouTube videos  he watches a lot but not ALL the time hes terrorising the household with a whoopies cushion at the moment. Im strict on bedtimes and diet because theyre so cranky if Im not. So there may be room for improvement ? But anyway what you need to hear from your boyfriend are proactive solutions. As the adult it is his job to lead and guide the relationship in order to support and nurture your son. So he needs to do some reading and or training in Floortime or the Denver Early Start Model or RDI. There are books available on Amazon which will give him a cheap but thorough start in these modalities. Under no circumstances should he jump in with parenting your son until he has done the necessary work to understand and relate to an autistic child properly. Perhaps he can get also counselling through his work to help him adjust to living with an autistic child ? Or perhaps your sons therapists will allow him to sit in on some sessions so he can start to see how your sons mind works...?But it is wholly unfair both to you and your son for him to move in and start complaining that things arent how he wants them and he never wanted kids anyway. If I were in this situation I have to admit I would be giving him a hard ultimatum  shape up or ship out. Either he shows your son the respect to do the work necessary to be in a loving and caring parental relationship with him or he has to move out. Because at the end of the day your sons needs farfar outweigh those of your boyfriend. ,autism,crbk7n3,6,t5_2qhs6

Im not even sure if you can say things have gotten better than the s since it wasnt until very recently that the common people even knew what Autism is.

4377150,0,t3_3b582d,I think the way I would describe my experience is that NT kids have their phases.  NonNT kids have those phases longer.  Sometimes a lot longer.  The best advise I can give on this is regarding small children  decide really quickly which behavior you are willing to deal with and the ones you are not.  If you allow the behavior it will stay a long long time.  Dont think a couple of months think a couple of years.Also be task oriented.  Know what the NT milestones are and take them in baby steps.If the little one has trouble sleeping try melatonin with doctors ok of course.  We had no idea how bad our little one was at going to sleep until we tried that.  HOLY MOLEY.Also pay attention to potty behaviors.  My husband and I noticed worse behaviors when constipated. Or when needing to go.  Bath time can do wonders. Whether bath time is for you or for the little one.  It really changes the mood.,autism,csj1gvv,12,t5_2qhs6

4651634,0,t1_ctg82s4,Here is the thing. No adult save for people who are imprisoned in some manner is actually obligated to do any of those things you listed. There are consequences for neglecting to do those things but no one canwill force them to. Unless those adults have disability. And thats just not ok.  Most Autistic people can usually understand consequences of choices. Its really basic cause and effect. Some autistic people need help in understanding the next direct effect of their choice or the longer term effect or both etc... but with help in figuring out what the consequences will be they can make choices that they are comfortable with. In our home we do not enact any contrived consequences for choices our three autistic children make. An example would be if my son has made the choice not to complete a homework assignment. Well this will mean his teacher is disappointed in him and may think he is irresponsible which will mean that in the in the future she will trust him less treat him differently etc. He will get a poor grade on that assignment which effects his longterm academic performance. He may develop poor habits if he makes this choice repeatedly making academic success much more difficult later. Etc and so forth. If he still does not do his homework well there is nothing I can do to force him to do it. We do tie academic effort into household resources as well to attempt to simulate adult life if you dont go to work you cant buy things so if hed like to access things such as the internet or television household resources then he must be a productive member of the household to the best of his ability. Again our kids make their choices... and live with the consequences. With my youngest son . years we watch and utilize a LOT of Daniel Tiger songs. I highly recommend you watch this show free on Amazon Prime and show episodes to your students. With every single autistic preschool aged and toddler aged child I know this show has been incredibly useful. Particularly its almost time to stop so choose one more thing to do the song followed by that was fun but now its done the song has been a god send for us. We sing this song dozens and dozens of times per day. Generally there is some ritual you can enact with each child that will tap into their interests and understanding which will make transitions and nonpreferred tasks much easier. Also when our youngest son is just not going to have tabletime for SLP or OT or whatever we dont make him. A skilled therapist can make ANY activity the child is doing at that time into a therapeutic activity. If my youngest son is having a meltdown there is no way he can meaningfully access the therapy that is being presented to him. Helping him to regulate himself with deep pressure or jumping or spinning or singing or talking about something he loves or a whole lot of other options that help very young children regulate is going to be the first step in helping him to access the therapy. Yes he does sometimes miss a whole session... but hes not missing anything if he cant meaningfully participate in that therapy at that time anyway! It always has baffled me when parents try to force compliance in this way. The child is not really present. The therapyactivity has no meaning. There is no benefit to anyone. I would point this out repeatedly to anyone who needed to remember this with regards to mandated hourstherapies. ,autism,ctgweby,4,t5_2qhs6

Theyre not for endless snacking but it shouldnt take that many of them to sort the daily need for O out.PS Vegan food often offers comparable nutrition with alternate textures  for example they often have sticky gummy candies rather than coated ones because a large part of the community rejects the beeswax coating.

If he sinks ignore the fact he sunk and focus on what a great try that was especially since he may or may not be nervous about the whole sinking thing and what we are going to do to fix it. I found that set points to swim to help swim to me without stopping then you get a break and then sneak back a little bit as he gets stronger.

5029301,0,t1_ctvwcid,Thank you for your reply. I am sorry I did not reply sooner but I assumed that Reddit would send me email notifications if anyone responded to anything I wrote and sadly that never happened. Its been about  weeks since Ive visited this site and the school year in Nevada started  weeks ago so things have been quite busy.You are correct in observing that my leaving one job after another was to avoid conflict. Please keep in mind that I did this BEFORE I realized I was autistic. I didnt know I was autistic until last April and the only reason I even learned this was because at the start of the previous school year I was assigned a high performing autistic student. Since this was a new experience for me I decided to read up on autism and as I read about the symptoms and characteristics  I found myself thinking Oh my goodness ... this sounds like me.I subsequently took two online tests which suggested that I was autistic and then sought out a psychologist who diagnosed me with Aspergers Syndrome. Just KNOWING that Im autistic has been a major game changer in my life because I now know why I am the way I am. For the longest time Ive felt like a round peg trying to fit into a square hole. Ive tried making friends. Ive tried dating. Ive tried working as a team player ... and none of this has ever come easily to me ... and now I know why. Now that I also know why I am the way I am I also know that Im entitled to certain measures of protection under the Federal Disabilities Act which mandates reasonable accommodation ... not just for students in our schools but also for teachers and staff who may suffer from a disability. And yes  youre right ... dealing with interpersonal conflict is very stressful but Ive evolved coping mechanisms for handling this. I dont have problems with students being rude or insubordinate because I have a progressive management plan that involves warning calling the parents sending the kid to the office and banning him from the kitchen with mountains of book work. I have had problems with administrators in the past and have not worked well with principals who have had autocratic management styles. In the past I either had to put up with this or move on to another job ... but now that I know that Im autistic I know that I have certain rights and can use these rights to fight back against a bullying supervisor ... not that I anticipate having to do this at my new school since my new principal is great! So long as I do my job and help my students learn and grow shes totally hands off which I really appreciate.,autism,cus80vk,1,t5_2qhs6

Instead of treating his trying to go outside as bad behavior why not treat it as an attempt at communication. He has a needdesire and hes trying to fulfill it. Next step is to work on getting him to ask you to go outside or pulling you to the door etc or getting his shoes on etc. We have our daughters outside typically  minday on top of whatever theyre getting in school.

We are kinda going through the same situation again except its with our second child and because son would be considered higher functioning theyve missed some red flag behaviours that were more readily seen in son.By comparison to Son theyre now saying now whats his excuse. So Ive had to firmly remind them of the umbrella diagnosis and by comparison of course youd miss the ticks in our son behaviour because son would not be considered high functioning. To a certain degree though trying to convince someone who is dead set in their ways is like trying to clean the ocean.. Its not like you can drain it. Lately Im  trying to not overwhelm myself by trying to convince them. Its too much negative stress and resentful emotion towards them when they downgrade and minimize how much we work to function at home.

We use this with our  year old daughter who was deemed ineligible for IBI and we try to target specific social skills like dealing with difficult people not always being first initiating play etc. Unfortunately in our region the wait list is now  months long and the time they offer never convenient once a week through summer sucks for camps her school ends late so if its during the school year we have to pull her out to go and the blocks so infrequent were no longer finding it much use. When she was younger it was great but not so much now. IBI on the otherhand you have to be assessed if eligible. Only those with more serious needsmore severe delays are generally admitted and like you know the wait list is fsking ridiculous. Our  year old wasnt deemed eligible but the assessment was worth it. They do give you a report and comment on their observations. The assessment itself is a lot of questions for you and playbased observation for the kids. Its about  min long but isnt bad at all. It was worth our time with our eldest even though she was ineligible. Our youngest now . years old was found eligible when she was  and at this rate her name should come up when she hits grade . The wait starts from the day you call not your diagnosis so its worth getting on the list now  you can always change your mind. I think Ive changed my mind  or  times completely at this point well have to see when her name comes up. With the IBI program they will be assessed against a very specific set of goals from basic academics patterns matching colors letters etc to basic selfcare dressing toileting and social skills. I know with a recent diagnosis you have a lot to work though both paperwork and emotionally but in this case may as well throw your name on both lists. IBI assessment should only take a couple of months to get to then years of waiting. Holler if you need any more help with services. Theyre a mess,autism,cyscgli,1,t5_2qhs6

6303066,0,t3_41xlg6,In regards to hitting others I would say consistency is key as well as learning to shareplaytake turns would help. From what I have experienced with my child and read about these are usually the stressors and things he needs to be taughthelped with. Can the staff member find another classmate to practice simple turn taking gradually with an activity he loves? It helped us so much. Simple examples  throwing a ball back and forth doing a small puzzle together or shape sorter. Im sure you have a fairly consistent schedule in your day but look at his perspective and see if theres ways to increase consistency.

6544428,0,t1_czvqkxn,I agree with the first part of this comment but I think its important to understand that autism really does limit some peoples abilities quite a lot  particularly if they also have comorbid disorders such as epilepsy or an intellectual disability. Needing livein help or living in a group home is just what works best for some.Absolutely every effort should be made to ensure that autistic kids grow up to be adults who can live at least semiindependently and increased services for adults would help with that tremendously. But some people do need a lot of help throughout their lives and saying theres nothing they cant do there are only things that are harder for them...I dont think thats accurate unless you want to get into a discussion on the meaning of the word cant. Sure maybe that person COULD go into the tooloud store but it would result in them having a meltdown and likely lashing out and injuring someone which carries the risk of getting arrested or shot by the police.

6735786,0,t1_d0fzy9e,There is something wrong with it when you give your opinion when it is explicitly not asked for. I dont think it is your place to give it when OP explicitly asks for autistic adults opinions. Look we have a lot of problems with not being listened to. And when you reaffirm that problem by speaking for us when explicitly not asked for you need to understand what that means.As for me commenting more isnt that what I am doing right now? This place is not comfortable. Very far from comfortable. Every time I come to this sub I see a lot of voices here most of them being parents educators and professionals in the field. Its very hard to come here but I do it because I need to claim my space as someone autistic. Nothing about us without us. Reading your response I feel like my fear and discomfort is rational. And please please please do not read into the words I say. I have no underlying message or meaning. My only point was that I sincerely wish that you do not speak on behalf of autistic adults when all the information and experience you have is from the third perspective. I wouldnt comment if OP explicitly asks for professionaleducatorparent perspectives. Seriously that is rude unasked for and simply not my place. I dont understand why that is difficult for you.If you wanted to give her another opinion which again there is nothing wrong with you couldve shot her a PM or responded to her thread from  days ago asking for info on all the types or therapies out there for her son. This sub was never a place for only autistic people and I never even insinuated that. This sub is a safe place for everyone affected by autism. Well its supposed to be but the point is that that is what this sub aims for. As for rudeness I urge you to think about this. You commented on a thread when the OP specifically explicitly asked for the opinions of autistic adults on their therapies. You are not autistic you have most likely not partaken in the same therapies as autistic people would and as such you have no first perspective necessary to answer the question appropriately. You insisting that you do telling me Im rude for asking you to keep this in mind is rude. It really really is when you are talking about autistic people like me.Next time autistic people mostly often take things literally and talk explicitly. Do not read into things that are not made explicit. This makes you part of our problems living our lives. Ive had a terrible childhood because of peoples insistence at implicit meaning in explicit words. When you talk about our autistic life as if you know what is best and what its like you are not doing your best. You do not know what its like and thats okay. It really is. The less you assume to know the more you can learn. And really theres never enough learning. You can always speak your opinion from your perspective when its welcome andor explicitly asked for. Doing it when its not is plain disrespectful. But hey thanks for causing my anxiety to rise up for the rest of the night.

Im an undiagnosed probably autistic and Ive been on the receiving end of this sort of thing a few times.Undiagnosed means Im somewhere in the murky region where normalbuteccentric and mildlyautistic blend together.

He might be anxious about socializing and feels that it is more comfortable when he initiates it.gt Also whenever were doing a learning exercise where none of us have any idea what were doingI think that not knowing the schedule of activities beforehand might make him anxious. Typically people with autism like to know what comes next. I think that if your teacher gave him a daily schedule that might help. If he is on an IEP there will be certain accommodations that will be required to be met.  gtIs there anything else I can do to help prevent him from freaking out about doing things wrong? Is this related to his autism?   If he feels comfortable talking to you highlight some of the things that he did well. Try not to compare him to his peers.

8289238,0,t3_4t022a,I usually dont tell them up front that Im on the spectrum as Ive yet to get a job when I disclosed at interview.  When I do get the job I dont tell them right away because I worry about discrimination as people dont understand autism well. Usually I make a bond with someone higher up manager etc and let them know about it so Ive got someone to advocate on my behalf.  In doing this Ive never gotten fired and that person often stands up for me when Im unable to do so myself.I personally take a month or two to get comfortable and proficient at a new job so I compensate for this by telling people that Ive got anxiety until I get into a routine.  People usually just assume that Ive got an anxiety condition something far more socially understood and that gets me proper accommodation to get the hang of the job before I disclose autism.Im not saying the way I do things is the right way.

The doctors reasoning is that because my son was virtually exclusively eating dairy bread crackers and so on that it was worth eliminating these to see if there was any effect.Does your son have any issues with his digestion  diarrhea constipation stomach pains etc? A lot of autistic people have gut issues which is where the pushing for special diets comes from. The idea being if hes sensitive to gluten or casein and is constantly eating that hes in pain which equals a shorter temper and more pronounced symptoms. Remove those things and the pain goes away. If he has no digestive issues theres no real need for a special diet.If he does have digestive problems going GFCF might help but it doesnt mean those things are necessarily the problem. It could just as easily be something completely different. In my case for example its certain meats.

I use to work with a girl who had anxiety and would cry and scream if she encountered things she didnt like know or want to do. I learned to help her through with positive praise through incentives sensory items step by step details a check list and slowly introducing her to new things. My first suggestion would be to find out if there is anything of sensorysoundmusic touch movementsthat help ease the girls and calm them down so you can explain it to them in terms they understand. Use positive speech. I know you said itd be like an adventure but to them that is too abstract and too big to comprehend through their anxiety. Compare the move to something positive you may have done as a family where they had fun. Keep it simple for them. I know you only have  months but if you can find what helps calm their triggers itll be easier to help them understand. One thing to do while packing is ask them what they want to bring. Ask them to help pack what they want to definitely bring. Maybe theyre afraid their things will be left behind? Maybe asking them to help pack can help calm their fears. Take a picture of all their toys clothes beds anything that may be important to them. Create a visual checklist that they each can see and help them find those items to place in boxes go as far as taking a picture of the boxed contents and placing a pic on the outside. Each item that is packed have the girls check it off so they know the items they want to bring are ready to go. I know it sounds like a lot for only  months left but it really may help their anxiety and fears. Praise them as they complete each task. But always be prepared to sooth them when their fears get too high. If they calm through rocking rock away. If they calm though holding a koosh ball and squeezing it have it ready. Try and catch them before their episodes get too large. I hope something here helps and I wish you all the best.

A lot of the research and provisions for autism involves autistic people on multiple levels. Perhaps we got a headstart because I think The National Autistic Society was the first official autism charity set up in the world although it went by a different name initially. I know Adam Feinstein writes about provisions in different countries around the world in A History of Autism  I will see if I can locate the specific section when I get a chance.    Edit Found the book and section here are some quotes from it relevant to autism provision in EU countries    gtWhen Bruno Bettelheims  book The empty fortress Infantile autism and the birth of self which blamed the parents for their childs autism became an acclaimed bestseller there were worldwide repercussions it was the first book about autism ever to be published in Spanish for example leading to years of misconceptions in Spain. About three quarters of French psychiatrists continue to treat autism with psychoanalytical methods  although to me at least most of them claimed not to be admirers of Bettelheim himself.    ...  gt In continental Europe the French remained backward in their thinkingparents continue to be held responsible for their childs autism by many professionals and even today around  of autistic children are still cared for in psychiatric hospitals. This explains why so many parents take their children across the border into Belgium.    ...  gt One target of the French parents outrage is the continued use of an approach known as le packing in which autistic children are wrapped for between  minutes and an hour in wet sheets which have been kept cool in a refrigerator. The techniquefor autism at leastwas pioneered by Pierre Delion a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst at Lille Regional University Hospital in northern France who suggests that the child in the pack undergoes a regression replaying in a secure environment the relationship between a mother and her newborn child and that when used as a therapy for autistic children who selfharm the treatment allows the child to rid itself progressively of its pathological defense mechanisms.

8805930,0,t3_50lu6z,Why dont you help them yourself? If you have any experiences or knowledge or techniques that could help them with their social skills use that to your advantage. You have the autistic brain that could give you a unique edge with helping other people with autism just as long as you properly hone your autism skills like through solving various peoples autistic problems and if you think of ways to explain autism to people then it might hone your brain just right to help them. Thats what I did. No you cant give them speech therapy but maybe you can find ways to help them to communicate with people better. If they have access touse of iPhones and iPads maybe theres some kind of speech or communication app that can help them to communicate with people better. You could maybe buy for them these AAC augmentative and alternative communication devices or communication boards for Christmas. Or if that would be way too expensive you can take a bunch of pictures of certain things off the Internet and put it into a Microsoft Word document and print it and let them use it. For example if you wanted to create a communication thing to help them communicate about what they want to eat for lunch you could put a bunch of different food pictures into a Word Document and then print it out for them. That same Word Doc that they can use for saying what they want for lunch they can also use to communicate what their favorite food is. Once they have that sheet of paper with food pictures You can ask them Whats your favorite food? or What do you want to eat for lunch? and then they can point at the picture of food that they want or like. ,autism,d76cqh3,1,t5_2qhs6

8944872,0,t3_52mhe3,Maybe this is a bit af a side road to your original question but I found this  research article They investigated  groups children normal developmentally disabled and autistic by putting each child in a room with its parent another adult and a toy. All children started playing with the toy. After some time the adult would either act in pain in fear or distressed and the parent would react on it. The nonautistic children both the normal and the developmentally disabled all looked at both the parent and the other adult at least once. Of the autistic children this was less than . The autistic children also touched their parent and adults less often. Throughout the autistic children looked more at the toy than the non autistic children.The researchers concluded from this that autistic children show less empathy. That is a big conclusion if you only measure two ways of showing empathy. However they never tested whether or not the children could actually hear the adults and deliberately gave the children a toy to distract them. The authors left it out of the conclusion but the autistic children comforted the hurt adult more than nonautistic children. To discover this one has to read the article carefully so it wouldnt suprise me if very few people noticed.So I think the Autistic people have less empathy idea is just outdated like the refrigorator moms. But because it is more recent and affects nonautistic people less it is countered less often which keeps it around.,autism,d7n1ies,3,t5_2qhs6

Thats why I dont think he should be forced to learn baseball except he himself wants to learn it. There are much better ways to improve his motor skills for example ergotherapy. It might be difficult or maybe even impossible for him to learn imitate and remember certain hand or leg movements. You need to be very very patient with him. And you need to show him each movement as slowly as possible. Rules are very important for many autistic people... but you should not explain him too many rules at once because this might be overwhelming for him. Talk slowly and in a calm and quiet voice.

A celebrity speculating about a child posting a video comparing Barrons behavior to stereotypical autistics characteristics is not OK.

History has many instances where other people labeled marginlized and did what was good while completely ignoring the people with the actual disability.

9979328,0,t3_5idr5o,As others have said having Autism is not a guarantee that programming would be a good fit but theres no shortage of reasons why a lot of folks on the spectrum tend to gravitate towards technical fields like that. Our brains tend to thrive in environments where the rules are clearly defined and gray areas where you have feel your way through are minimized. This is exactly why I was totally a math nerd when I was in school. I loved the idea that once I knew the rules I could decipher and solve any math problem you threw at me. For those who say that coder culture requires social skills I would like to point out that if you put a group of Autists in a room who know that they all have similar interests they can carry on a very normal conversation just because the subjects are familiar. Even in some more severe cases an Autist can talk confidently about a subject that they are passionate about but those social skills often fall apart when the subject of conversation switches to something less familiar.,autism,db8c2a3,3,t5_2qhs6

So she interpreted those things as my fault because she didnt understand what autism was or what it had to do with anything.

Because either something is very wrong with him personally and I dont mean this as broken but wrong like the feeling of eating mayonnaise when you thought it was whipped cream that needs a professionals expertise to identify and assist with... or something very wrong is happening to him that needs professional intervention.,autism,ddilh10,30,t5_2qhs6

11229104,0,t3_608d24,Just to be clear MDMA does not come in pill form unless it is mixed and cut with a binding agent. Usually mixed with just crystal meth amphetamine or many of the other research chemicals that give you a somewhat similar feeling. MDMA should come as small crystals sometimes powdery and you should test it with a reagent kit to ensure it turns dark purple and not yellow. Look up bunk police for testing info.Also MDMA does make you happy and accepting of the isness it will however make you sad and irritable for a few days after taking it. Your brain needs to get back to baseline.In my personal journey through drugs and autism I think the best help I have found is from tryptamines. Eating mushrooms in a safe environment are the best to understand and accept ones situation. They also help stabilize serotonin for weeks after so there is no sad phase.  If you are strong then you should move up to smoking nnDMT not meo... it has helped me and a few people I would call friends in embracing our differences and inspiring us to do the best we can with what we have.I think most drugs in the phenethylamine class are not very good. This includes crystal methamphetamine adderall wellbutrin MDMA CB etc... I have tried them all and while they give you a strong sense of well being while on them once you come down that feeling goes away.  Remember that MDMA stands for Methylene Dioxy Meth Amphetamine Yes it is a meth amphetamine. Tryptamines have always been kind of difficult while high its not always laughs and bright colors but when coming down and for the next few weeks I am at peace. Understanding the probability of the universe spacetime being born out of the void and that sentient organisms will happen and that I am one of the random organic expressions of the void... It is calming when you grok the entire equation.. TLDR MDMA is a fake drug makes you sadder afterwords. Mushrooms are the best it can be a difficult trip but you will be rewarded with inner peace and acceptance afterwords.,autism,df4syeb,6,t5_2qhs6

I have come across that repeatedly with my boy.He once called another girl fat which really upset her. He wasnt being nasty. She genuinely was overweight and he in his mind was just telling the truth how do u explain to a child that sometimes its ok to lie?.Fortunately the girls mothers friend also had a boy who was autistic and was very understanding but my boy was really upset that he had upset this other girl.

There were certain concepts that the textbook just did not bother to explain and in a few cases they specifically mentioned they would not explain it so you could understand it better. Well that did not work for me.There are a couple of things you can do about it. Try to define the concept in some way by reading more about it. Sometimes a simple google search returns an instant definition of the subject that can help to give it a place in your thoughts. Try to find out what is and what isnt part of the frameworktheory. By finding out what it is made off you can assemble it in your head. Ignore the concept. Usually these abstract concepts hold no value outside of the courses.,autism,dfa7qhn,2,t5_2qhs6

11437043,0,t3_639ea7,I dont know why ABA helped speech but for our . yo son it really helped. He was almost completely nonverbal around  yrs but within  weeks of starting ABA sessions where he was forced to request items by speech he started saying alphabets and numbers. Right now cognitively he still has a long way to go but he can say all his alphabets count till  and can also complete lines of nursery rhymes though he will not pronounce them clearly. And yes there is the controversial aspect of it. It was very tough to watch at first because they had to strap him down on a high chair and made to do repetitive tasks because he would run away to other desirable objects in the room. But within a few weeks he started looking forward to his sessions and just sits without being strapped in and completes tasks. He also has started using more verbal requests. The only reason I say ABA helped is because he has not had much consistent Speech Therapy sessions because of various turnover issues at his preschool.,autism,dfsdlxv,0,t5_2qhs6
