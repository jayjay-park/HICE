198198,0,t1_cf0u3cc,I will admit ive spent a little on gold but not too much you can be successful without spending too much. Looking at your roster I can tell you right now youre going to need more characters even the cheap ones more characters means a higher boost in PVP stats. Focus on blasters and scrappers infiltrators are useless reassign them to blasters or scrapper itll make a world of difference. Farm for CP! Season  Chapter  Mission  you have Storm already just keep playing it but never  star it. Sames goes for Season  Chapter  Mission . You can make a lot of CP that way that and there is a lot of CP to earn in any of the Season  chapters.So instead of buying infl IW get blaster IW. Take kitty and get her scrapper shadowcat alt instead. Try and get as many as you can to lv . As for PVP teams you have Frost which is a great support character and you have hulk consider his grey hulk alt once you get him to at least lv . WWII Captain America with Niko is also viable.For weapons you can get get Scroll of Angolob from incursions which is super useful Golden screaming eagle from spidermans premium mission and golden tyrant blade from mastery of chapter . Last but not least your PVP armory try and stack that as high as you can I like to keep my defense and offense as even as possible but the stat boost you get from your armory can be the difference between winning and losing.Okay thats my wall of text I hope it helps if you ever have any questions or run into any problems feel free to PM me.,MAA,cf10mfb,1,t5_2vtkh

350862,0,t3_1y3o0n,Quicksilver and Havok. When Pietro takes the first turn use L. Then give Havok a Chrono Boost if he isnt already taking the next turn. Use Havoks L  L to immediately oneshot kill Beast before he takes a single turn. Then take your time with Famine and Apocalypse allowing Havok to waste his lost turn while you have  odds. If he gains Uncanny Coordination even better but dont rush it. The rest of the way you should use at least one of Quicksilvers turns as an inventory turn use Pages of Vishanti Healing Elixirs Shwarma etc.. Protect Havok so that he can oneshot kill a different Horseman every other round. Thats been my strategy.,MAA,cfh4uoj,7,t5_2vtkh

585201,0,t3_20t7wa, Who does he work well with? As said in other posts precounter heroes work well with him. Heroes that have access to exploit bleeds will be powerful due to his fully stacking bleeds with one ability. Sabretooth comes to mind. Eiso?  Sting might be interesting but Im going to stick to relentlesssurprisingstumproof chance to stun Move order?  Depends on the fight. If blaster is there LLLL repeat into infinity. If no blaster LLL repeat. Agent items?  The radian set seems to be pretty powerful with him though powerful buff items to shore up his weak damage might also be welcome Pvp? No idea though I feel he will be in a few teams nxt pvp season as the warriors  seem to work well together. Buff?Nerf?

759360,0,t3_22uom7,The original reason why it was so sought after was the ability to QA a health and stamina siphon from the opposite team and then have a really good chance of stunning the entire enemy team with the hotshot.This gave your entire team  rounds of uninterrupted rape train attacks.The question has become however does it still hold up in the game over a year and a half later?Since it was originally released a few things have also been released Juggs cant be stunned You have E iso preventing you from being stunned You have mystic shroud items You have Rescuenow the chances for auto stunning an entire enemy team has been reduced. That being said its still a set that provides a lot of synergy and when you can get it to work it works great.Also remember that Beasts Alt AND Satana have been released since the set originally came out so it can also help. Not to mention the Thorny in the gold sale which you can use to replace about half the set items.Unfortunately this is going to be one of those sets that you take a gamble on if youll use it for a while or not.My personal favorite SO set is the Chess set but as of last summer it got a massive nerf as well instead of countering every time youre hit with the rook its now only a CHANCE to counter.

1039737,0,t1_chmgaay,Sure thats true. And if you honestly feel that heroes are released quickly enough that once all heroes are maxed the g is a justified amount then more power to you I guess. Personally Im not willing to invest that much gold into something that will eventually become almost entirely obsolete. The character release schedule is slow enough that having two bays in unnecessary after having all heroes and the level cap is so seldom raised that it makes it difficult to justify a full g purchase. ,MAA,chmh0so,1,t5_2vtkh

Theres no need for angooob with Cube and mystic and try to put shield breaker aiso on Starlords lvl  thats my antidote for Invisible Womans air pressure iso. Theres also a summon attack with a fatal blow on Starlod lvl that you can turn into a quick action with an aiso.Gamora should get crits boosted. And your agent would be healing and debuffing with the cube hopefully.,MAA,cmpgh13,1,t5_2vtkh

So heres what I can tell from that It only has a chance to occur during Mollys first turn in a round meaning that it wont happen during a tantrum. The candies have the same effects as the items in that they buff your whole team and debuff the enemy.And for those who dont remember here are the possible candiesTaffy Restores HP and stamina to all allies and applies Adhesive X enemies cant protect counter or dodge and has a chance to immobilize and sticky reduced evasion.Candy Apple Restores HP to allies and grants a Sugar rush  attack boost. Also exhausts all enemies.Marshmallow Ghost Granted Ethereal to allies has a chance to go incorporealphased when attacked avoiding damage and restores a small amount of HP while phased and applies Cower to all enemies.The ghost is probably the best one on the first turn since she can safely phase before a tantrum.

4676073,0,t3_3ezbdw,With all the stuff I start up in here Im surprised none of the mods here have slap me on the wrist yet and told me NO Bad user.... BAD!! No Tacos for you. Either these mods are terrible at their job for free laborers or all of them have a huge crush on me and I dont blame them. Im pretty damn adorable. Just kidding. Id be a liar if I didnt admit having start fights in threads on reddit but to be fair I do keep it contained within the topic of discussion instead of letting it spread across other threads which was the case here. At the same time if its a complaint or better yet a rant to vent meaning if there isnt meaningful to talk about with other users we should try to not make a thread about it. No one is saying you cant vent but seriously is there really much of a difference between writing it down on a piece of paper and not posting it vs posting it online? If you are angry and dont care what people think its like why post it for people to see unless you want the attention you want people to agree with you and personally I think that is weak sauce and if you are going to do that you should prepare yourself for the backlash of people telling you to suck it up. I dont want to sound like an old guy but ugh this isnt facebook and twitter I dont want to know what you think and feel about everything. Oooh I won this on the roulette.  Ugh Force refreshes again! Why does playdom keep screwing me over?!! And most of the time the answer to those questions are its not just you the game doesnt revolve around you. Its all random and you have good days and you have bad days. And Force Refreshes are not necessarily playdoms fault if you have thousands of players trying to access the game at the same time and no its not that easy to just buy a bigger server because those are insanely expensive for a game that might not survive  years from now. It might not be worth the investment.With that said I would suggest a RANT VENT megathread if possible but I dont know what capabilities reddit has if that can be pulled off or not. And mc...........

6069070,0,t1_cyf4k84,It has an impact on PvE even for the vanilla IF though. I mean his HoSL wasnt exactly overpowering but it no longer prevents debuffs being applied on him anymore which makes him very much a oneshot hero for removing debuffs from himself. Something better done with items that would prevent reapplication like the gene item.His healing does next to nothing in terms of heals now barely breaching  of the HP bar at times and is outmatched by PvE healing items.That means hes effectively a combo breaker and LL setuppuncher because realistically his L and L are going to be so situational as to be useless  youre probably  times out of  better off just using the items in PvE than using those abilities and that is a bit silly.Todays daily mission is a good example of this without the agent he would be the goto hero just to sustain with heal and potentially emergency clear out his own debuffs yet he cant do either very well and it isnt worth sacrificing the damage for those two abilities. He wasnt even overpowered in those situations because the very nature of using the healing just as an example meant you were sacrificing strength somewhere in the line up sometimes it was a case of delaying an inevitable defeat other times it was tactically delaying to keep someone alive to deal a finishing blow. Neither option really is viable now because the costratio of his healing is borderline pointless.I agreed that HAIF needed toning downnerfing but vanilla IF got screwed pretty badly too and Im speaking from a lowbie perspective. He was a useful character in PvE and had limited potential in PvP hes now just borderline a waste of space in both. Unfortunately a lot people are whining about HAIF and the rest are just ignoring any concerns about Vanilla IF  even on the official forums without even presenting a reasonable evaluation on the impact of the changes likely because there are better options available for them which isnt necessarily the case for newbie players. ,MAA,cyf57qm,5,t5_2vtkh

And even if the playdom team worked on it because they need to get approval from Marvel and such whom are probably the main people responsible for the delay they wouldnt be able to get approval to launch anyway. So until then enjoy the Holidays.

7037714,0,t3_4by8g7,Check to see if you can buy them...they may be evergreen meaning theres no rush to acquire them.  But according to the Wiki the Gold sale just expired they were G for the Infiltrator and G for the Scrapper version so unless theyre evergreen or you completed the task back in October they will likely be locked.  If you can spend CP on them they will cost  or  CP depending on which class you want him to be.That may make your decision for you but I have two pieces of advice.  Sorry in advance for the wall of text. Its almost always advised to go after the Spec Ops heroes first rather than picking up alts.  Cammi will go evergreen eventually but it will cost CP to recruit her when she does.  If Gwen and Kate are all youre missing youre looking at spending  CP and basically getting three heroes.  This is to say nothing of how itll let you farm the Epic Boss roulette for limited edition AISO EISO gear and research components. Note that you can always spend Gold to skip the final task.  Its generally illadvised if you can farm the CP to get the necessary heroes but you might be a massive Daredevil fan.  Its probably suboptimal in the economic sense to spend your Command Points on an alt at this point but this is your game.  If thats what is going to make it more fun for you do it.  TLDR  The alt probably isnt available to you anymore but if he is and you want it grab it.  This is a game after all.  That said if youre looking for the most efficient use of your resources get Gwen and Kate in order to recruit Cammi then circle back when you have spare CP to grab the Man Without Fear alt next time its available.,MAA,d1e2xmr,2,t5_2vtkh

7190315,0,t3_4dy7ko,Shield Breaker seems pretty pointless as the only threat would be Invisible Woman and I dont think people run into her in PVP that often. If you do rough. If it was me Id slap that irradiated aiso on it just to stack that blaster mine exploit by a good . Invisible Woman wouldnt be able to remove it and the only thing it bypasses are the Worthy but shield breaker doesnt exactly stop them either. His level  you should really use his Mine Master aiso because Magnetized can be applied by others. And having this with magnetized on the field would save you from having to use his level  to detonate. L is fine but his level  I dont think youd need. As for eiso I think the Stalwart one can work with his mines since they are techinically single target attacks someone needs to test this. Basically every single target attacks he does he gains a shield and his blaster forms lvl  has Shield Slam. So each time you get a chance to set a mine switch to his blaster mode and take advantage of his level  for pure damage and considering you have Tech Upgrade Shield Slam Crit and Ignore defense if there is a Bruiser Fixer can be a power house without the actual use of his mines. You dont even need to use irradiated if you dont have it as the aiming aiso can grant an additional  damage with locked on. So personally Im surprised people arent using him for his damage potential alone beyond the mines. I would use his first turn to go Tact use his extra turns change back to blaster and use his level  twice and do insane damage. Shield Slam does an additional  so its important to keep shields on him but not have Fixer apply it himself so pairing him with Invisible Woman or Agent with Savant Spear can help. ,MAA,d1vh7of,1,t5_2vtkh

I would save my gold for the th gear slot and then save still more for the Cube next time it comes on sale.Now... that having been said...If you absolutely must spend gold on a hero buy Spitfire.Realistically however save your CP and get Union Jack as soon as you can feasibly accomplish it.  UJ alone was a huge difference in my PvE success.  I was in the same place you are and buying Union Jack was a massive power boost in my ability to clear challenge modes and finish chapters out.  The combination of Spitfire and Union Jack together is nearly untouchable in PvE and is actually decent in PvP you wont get to Adamantium with them but for a nonmeta team theyre not terrible.TLDR Save your gold for the th gear Slot and Synthetic Cube.

8453606,0,t3_4vfwts,Songbird goes well with Avalanche or Quake. I recommend Avalanche because SB can cover him vs bruisers while he covers her vs Infiltrators. Whenever she uses a sonic attack he gains the Making Waves damage buff and she can use at least two a round. Yes her damage is lacklustre but I think thats because Exploits are still broken. She has the useful ability to make a ranged or melee attack possibly not happen which can be a life saverthats her true value I think.,MAA,d5y8iks,2,t5_2vtkh

8483798,0,t1_d61lx7s,I feel like not a lot of people are going to be traipsing out their Tacticians anytime soon what with the most recent PvP suit reward and all. Bag of Tricks amp Big Boss might be provident if the Tactician has any ability or weapon that can cause and sustain Generalized If the player is using a Tactician agent at least one Free Action gadget would definitely be a must but this would also be contingent on the Agent not getting wiped out in the first turn.I feel like very particular Tactician heroes may be able to include one of these EIsos in their base suits in conjunction with their own personal EIsos i.e. Magneto Kang and Dr. Doom but using two or more will almost certainly require a Tactician agent.,MAA,d620qj9,1,t5_2vtkh

8540386,0,t1_d68y64z,Okay so youve got some great cpvalue heroes here e.g. Quicksilver War Machine Dr. Strange ... and youre aiming to get Ronan so thats another Bruiser in your stable...If youre looking at a pool of  cp were obviously ruling out the cp Blasters i.e. no Havok Vision Daimon Beta Ray Bill In my opinion BRB is superawesomesauce because of his versatility with electric attacks see Victor Mancha. If you decide to shore up your cp reserve my opinion for PVE is BRB gt Havok gt Vision gt Daimon note Daimons Worthy Costume is great to use in PVP and annoying as heck to fight. Cable  cp would be my pick if youre looking for a new hero and I strongly suggest getting him the Calculated Force EISO  Gold because it gives his singletarget attacks Measured and it makes his Level TechnoOrganic Rampage attack amazing if you cant find it his Recharge action extends so he can enter technoorganic mode with  new actions. Elsa Bloodstone cp has an AOE Despair prevents enemy healing and resurrection but you will rarely need Despair in PVE.  Modern Armor Thor cp. A little overbudget but because he starts combat with x Might of Mjolnir his M.O. is to finish battles early and quickly.  Quicksilvers AOU Blaster Costume cp with the Mauling AISO  Gold. I know that the costume is currently not available I checked the Wiki but this combo is great because QSs attacks are stealthy AND can apply Flanked. War Machines Blaster Iron Patriot cp is great for AOE grunt clearance especially with Ionizing AISO  Gold or Aiming AISO  Gold on his Level attack GunSalute. If youre in a long fight i.e.  waves you will likely have to Recharge him which spoils your battle score a little bit.  Dr. Stranges Modern cp is also great and flexible but I strongly recommend your agent or other hero act as a protector because Strange is very squishy low health and defenseNote If you were interested in preparing a PVP setup I might suggest simply buying the cheapestCP Blasters and Tacticians to buff up your Attack and Health respectively.,MAA,d69479c,2,t5_2vtkh
