417960,0,t1_cfnwkh4,  You know damn well that nothing ever gets returned to the population.  Tell that to the wildlife here.  Seriously you just said that it doesnt count when its dry  they dont like the water since its in the way  and that trails that already exist by the canals are a good thing.  Are you even from here?I wouldnt drink the coolaid if I where you.  Where is the fixed amount of water going?  To the population?  Because your use of crowded would suggest that population has a direct impact on an irrigation canal.  The point is to get more revenue for every drop delivered.The warmer weather models would also suggest more water in the Deschutes.  Where does the melted snow  glaciers go?  Take a minute to think about it.  Deschutes gets its water primarily from the mountains not our local weather climate.,Bend,cfo35np,-2,t5_2sj1v

6074915,0,t3_3xq5ny,Your Housing Costs  Prineville least expensive then Redmond then Bend being high.  Depending on what you like to do I would guess to be a factor.  Bend has many great places to eat and socialize with a drink or not Redmond does have some good places also but due to population is a little less lively at night.  Prineville in my opinion is pretty limited on quality places for night time socializing.Prineville is old school I think once you move there I think you will notice people opening up to you and they do host some fun events like horse racing and rodeo.  Outdoor activities are great with the exception if you downhill ski it will add another  minutes to the mountainAll of Central Oregon has everything you would probably want to do outside and more.Contact the Chamber of Commerce of each city and contact a real estate agency or  for pros and cons.  If you decide to move to Prineville I would rent for awhile to be sure you want to live there and then consider buying  the housing market there is softer than the other areas and with the rates low you could build equity.Ive lived here for  years lived here since I was  and would be happy to try to answer any questions.,Bend,cyfwogh,1,t5_2sj1v

KTVZ is a complete joke and beholden to their endless advertisers but news tends to be speedy and they catch most of the important local stuff with good converage.Id recommend KPOV for in depth local conversations  or KBND  or   KBNW or other local news.Cascade Business News is also activecurrent  There is also COCCs Broadside for another angle  You can also setup google feeds that pull from OPB Oregonian and other sources for articles about Bend. ,Bend,d4pzc4d,4,t5_2sj1v
