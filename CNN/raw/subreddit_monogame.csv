7870972,0,t3_4lb2id,Use MonoGames Content Pipeline.gt Im not using MonoGames Pipeline could that be the reason Im having problems with Content?Use MonoGames Content Pipeline.gt Another problem Im having with Content is that if I want to have sounds or font I have to make needed .xnb with XNA.Use MonoGames Content Pipeline.Look I get the desire to not use the Pipeline tool. I also did that for a long time but honestly its there for a reason.The whole point of the Content Pipeline is to prepare your content so that it works well on whatever platform youre targeting. Textures are compressed sounds are converted to a consistent format and font files are processed so they can actually be used.gt BTW if I make those .xnb files with Pipeline or something do I need to copy .png files to my Content folder?The Pipeline is intended to have files that go in one end and come out the other as .xnb files. In other words once the .png files are processed into .xnb files you only need to have the .xnb files in the output folder.,monogame,d40rpu6,1,t5_2tsuw

11063826,0,t3_5xyjup,Oh wow I had no idea about that thanks for sharing. Few months ago I tried to submit a game I wrote written in monogame to IDxbox and got rejected. This sounds like its much easier to get it on the store.,monogame,dem2fh5,1,t5_2tsuw
