Sunday I made a small car crash. It was simply few scratches around the other person bumper. Anyway the person from an insurance carrier advised my parents that Ive to acquire an insurance as soon as i get my certificate even when I dont get yourself a vehicle. Our parents cannot afford to buy me acar anyway and so I was planning to drive their car since I would not have to get an insurance basically drive their cars. However the dude is telling me that I HAVE to get an insurance not or whether I am finding my car. Ive never been aware of these things before. Why I have to acquire an insurance even if i am not obtaining auto can anyone show me? And also is there some other way I can fix than not getting a certificate this issue other?
