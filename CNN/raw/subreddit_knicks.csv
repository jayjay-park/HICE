2737507,0,t3_2rdph4,Lucky you youre not in the area to actually have to live through this shit storm. There are a lot of factors on the court that lead up to their current record this includes but is not limited to  no interior defense  dalembert doesnt intimidate anyone and hes the best weve got  no perimeter defense  teams ALWAYS take advantage of our inability to guard three pointers. Ive had to stop watching the games because its infuriating but if you look at the recent game against Portland its a good example lagging offense  its taking too much time for people to be in the right positions for the triangle and by the time people are where they need to be the opposing teams defense has had time to adjust and settle in and too much time has come off the shot clock to do anything worthwhile which usually leads to a contested mid range jumper  not committing to cuts  often the players start the game making good cuts but the general pattern is that later on due to either fatigue or worse lack of effort youll see players casually walking to the spots of the triangle allowing defensive players to cover the passing lanes completely negating the spacing that the triangle offense affords them.  JR  he has no idea whats happening in the triangle offense. He doesnt cut and when he catches the ball his first through fifth options are shooting.  no post threat  we dont have a Shaq to draw a double team and kickstart a series of cutspasses leading to an open basket. Theres one on one coverage all the time and melo is the only one capable of creating his own shot with consistent results.  lack of cohesion  a lot of these guys arent going to be here next season and you can see it on the court. Theres a lack of camaraderie and some people are  playing for themselves and not for the betterment of the team. Theres plenty more but these are the glaring issues Ive seen watching games and reading the analyses. After the record reached a few games below . everyone just seemed to give up. And now it looks like were playing for Jahlil Okafor. I dont know how the Knicks are going to lure any other free agents into this mess. ,knicks,cnf8r08,6,t5_2s735
