8215948,0,t1_d52s6zt,Its got  miles. Just a small rust spot on the rear passenger fender above the wheel well. Theres a few tiny rock chips in the hood that I am going to repair and will probably attack that rust at the same time before it gets worse. Overall though it looks almost like new. I plan to replace tranny fluid right away is there anything else I should do or watch for?,fordescape,d54jr5w,2,t5_38arr

8669199,0,t3_4ymskm,I loved my  XLT and had very few issues with it. My biggest complaint is that itd pop a check engine lamp every k miles or so due to the capless fuel system leaking some air. It wasnt worth fixing so I left it be. But aside from that totally solid vehicle.,fordescape,d6p9qil,2,t5_38arr

10781937,0,t1_dds0d3e,Had both these issues with my . From what Ive heard  rust is a big problem on the rear fenders in st and nd gen Escapes. AC went out at one point too. Also  check that recalls have been addressed Specifically the one for the throttle body sticking. Otherwise  my Escape was a great vehicle! Just sold it back in September and upgraded to a new MKC. Still miss it a lot though!!,fordescape,dds2txe,1,t5_38arr

11765113,0,t3_67r24t,I do have a question for everyone anyone using the leaked version and updating? If so did you downgrade and then updated? ,fordescape,dgtlt49,1,t5_38arr
