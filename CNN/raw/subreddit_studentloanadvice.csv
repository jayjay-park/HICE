9110986,0,t3_54c5ji,Random question and Im not even sure how to explain it properly or if this is something you can answer but here it goes I was enrolled in Ai of Tampa and had to take a semester off due to foot surgery in which I could not drive or walk for  weeks and when I was able to I was in extreme pain so sitting in class for  hours a day was not acceptable at the time. Well only after I graduated did I realize they took out a student loan for that semester even though I was not even enrolled in classes. It that allowed? How and why would they do that? Ive also somehow accumulated almost k of student loans when I was paying out of pocket for  years. I know a k loan was taken out I believe at The Academy of Art where I had to leave because they no longer offered my degree and didnt bother to tell me until right before my second semester. The other k is somehow at Ai when in reality the amount Ive paid out of pocket should have only been around k. I have my loans through Great Lakes is that huge difference the interest? How can I take care of these loans when my current job is shit and the design market in my area is shit and I cant move because my husband is military. ,studentloanadvice,d86zrea,1,t5_2ubzj
