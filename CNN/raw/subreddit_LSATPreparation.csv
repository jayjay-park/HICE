9880698,0,t3_5gn81q,I agree with above  keep in mind also a CBT answer does not HAVE to be true it could be but does not have to be for example there could be other possibilities and this particular answer choice COULD BE one of them... but a MBT is ALWAYS true. Its an answer that there is no doubt about it. For example in a logic game even if there is more than one diagram that u may be working with that particular answer choice is always true in all the scenarios. Hope it helps good luck ! ,LSATPreparation,davh83v,2,t5_34ghz
