6748066,0,t3_4861lr,I listened to the first single the day it was released and really liked it. I listened while at work on headphones so I wasnt able to pay full attention to the lyrics. I was hanging around at home today and listened to it with my full attention along with the lyrics and immediately fell in love with the song. It is a superb and breath taking song. I noticed that no one had annotated the song on genius.com so I started contribution my own interpretations and annotations. You should do the same!,FrightenedRabbit,d0hb1pi,1,t5_2vkcq
