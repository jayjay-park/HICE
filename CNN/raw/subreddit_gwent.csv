Milling cards you dont want also has to give you less dustore value compared to crafting a card you do want otherwise the whole system wouldnt be working anywhere near the same levels of profit.

Incredibly good if you play it as your first and only opening card with monsters. Problem is it can backfire. And terribly. Roach is also great if you know how to use him.Olgierd is a strange card. You can create a deck around him but it wont be very flexible.Sarah is a very good card for a weather monster card. Most veteran players will try to destroy her as soon as you put her in the table so you can use her to force the enemy to lose a damaging card. If he doesnt... well she can get out of control. Getting  points is not hard for her.NR Philippa. For obvious reasons. The trebuchets and Priscilla are also good. So much they might be overpoweredMonsters I dont know CaranthirWooland spirit and Imlerith? The best thing about Imlerith is that it damages a whole row gold cards included. So if you a weather effect you can play him next make  to a golden card and kill the other cards in the row.Gaunter ODim is also good for damaging. He has  points and creates  cards with  strength that also make damage for  point. Can be useful. And you can use the  shadows for a thunderbolt potion ?Skellige Skellige is good overall. Even the bronze cards have a lot of potential. King Bran if you go for a discard deck. Id say Sigfrida and restoration are a must in Skellige. Madman Lugos is another awesome card. If you play at the end he can get  easily.Scoiatel. No clue as I rarely use them. Aglais is good maybe a must have too as it allows you to use ANY spell already used in the game but other than that I think it depends of your deck.

9615907,0,t1_d9ycsna,Depends. I think Monsters are still a very good faction and they just need proper deckbuildingsome expensive cards as well to be able to get to the SkelligeNR levels. Yeah they are strong for beginners and easy to play but they need more finesse to get to a higher level. Its also not suprising that youre playing a lot vs Skellige IMO thats the most powerful faction by a longshot.

9631883,0,t3_5cvw1s,The problem usually isnt by itself. Its when you combine a bunch of things like Philippa and Igni. When someone doesnt have the cards they dont have their own BS to just counter with. But Im not sure that means the individual cards are by themselves at fault. Thats the balancing issue. When everyone has their cards setup is there some setup that is just so powerful everyone will use it and kill all variety?Im not sure Igni and Philippa are at that level. Maybe Igni moreso because its a Neutral but there are always going to be staples. Probably Horn and Demeritium bomb are staples. Is Igni a staple? I dont know. If it is a staple is that really bad?

9646779,0,t3_5d6jxg,Philippa is currently one of the strongest cards in the game  so much so that shes about to get a major nerf. I agree the disloyal cards indicator could be more clear.Problem is that writing out every legendary would take a lot of work and theyre very specific to the decks the play with. In Philippas case shes good because if your opponent has a row of majorly strong cards you can set them all to  strength. Paired with a Lacerate  from all units in a row it can decimate an opponent playing to one row of the field.So if you can tell us who youd like to be playing it would narrow down explaining some of the most useful cards and common combos you should try and play around.,gwent,da25yuh,1,t5_384zi

9669167,0,t3_5dglh5,There are still ways to make Bran useful now.  I really like the idea of discarding  from hand and  from deck or especially  from deck and keeping the tutor effect.Anyway Bran can be used near the very end to buy a turn if you have one card in hand and you Bran then nothing happens its essentially a turn skip no value obviously but I usually get enough throughout the final round that waiting a turn is all I need to do.The other way it can be useful is again near the end of the game to discard any cards like Skirmisher and En Craite Raider to get a needed card like Commanders Horn out of your deck.As a whole yeah hes definitely the weakest hero.  No other hero card adds nothing to the board while crippling your hand size card advantage.  He definitely needs to be changed before launch  that being said I still use him in my Revenant deck for clutch D bombs only removal card I run against Thunderbolt potion Monsters and buff buff buff Northern Realms otherwise I grab the commanders horn sometimes Geralt Igni if theres amazing value waiting for him.,gwent,da4xe6b,1,t5_384zi

Geralt pass losses you first round but gives CA to you that is not aggro that is control.Modern RG tron is ramp not aggro aggro is probably trons worst matchup Karn on t is great but doesnt win the moment it hits the board thats why GR tron has sweepers in maindeck to combat aggro.Skirmisher being  bronze card is not tempo its value balanced by being conditional. Unsummon is your classic tempo card it clears creature for only  mana bigger creature you bounce more tempo you gain.

And yeah this is coming from a SKellige player from level  and counting.,gwent,danfb06,1,t5_384zi

9835398,0,t1_dapizav,In the current patch if you see Dagon you know youre playing against weather and play accordingly. Your comment is just a ruse to convince people that a build not focused on weather is viable so when they play against your weather deck theyll misplay and throw their Clear skiesFirst Light away. tldr It was a bad joke,gwent,dapkpas,3,t5_384zi
9837787,0,t3_5g5n7i,I think  strength would go a long way and make the card really strong. Ive left her in my radovid control deck combo her either with weather or with Sabrina.

Id like to see the disparity because Monsters and NR are the best factions for those with small collections. Skellige discard is a very strong deck and is only getting stronger as other strategies are balanced.

9848050,0,t3_5gb4wr,Good enough if you have nothimg better to put in the silver slots. Usually I find myself picking something else though. What I am wondering about is why the witchers are so much better than the Crones. Not only are they different stregth  which makes them harder to igni or scorch but also they get extra buffs with potions. Crones on the other hand still take up half your silver slots they are all the same strength above  all together relevant for igni purposes and they still get regular strength from potions. Is it because they have a chance of staying on the board when the round ends? Witchers have the same ability.,gwent,dar825t,1,t5_384zi

9877846,0,t3_5gudoj,The thing you have to remember about Gwent is that is it played in rounds of  out of . You can lose a round in order to win the game. Say you play hard to win Round  and you have in your hand Prince Stennis and say Ciri. So in Round  you play out of a little play Stennis draw a card play Ciri make your opponent play some cards then just pass and lose. You are now up  cards one from draw with Stennis and  from Ciri coming back your hand. If you opponent did not also do that and you played  for  with him you should now have  more cards going into the rd round. That is a HUGE advantage. You are much more likely to win the rd round now disregarding each of your card quality. You can save trump cards until your opponent cannot play cards anymore and just win outright. ,gwent,dav3u9b,11,t5_384zi

9884304,0,t1_davegob,gtClass cards are always better then neutral cards because they can only be played in  type of deck so youd have a really hard time against faction decks.Theres really not much basis for this.Neutral cards are there because they provide something any or many factions might be able to make use of.Many games have this option from Warmachine where you can use Mercenary leaders MtG where you can easily make Artifact decks.In most cases the faction cards are just synergistic with their own faction and in most cases would be broken in the other Factions most faction cards are actually weaker simply so they can allow other Faction cards to be really strong and synergize with them.,gwent,davy5pr,1,t5_384zi

You have to play the guessing game yourself granted but you can certainly work around it and note  its one less card in your opponents hand.gtits the spamming of it through commandos.It really is not.Spamming of a trap via commandos does  things.  Gives the opposing player direct information WHAT ambush card is on the table  Uses up a commando that could have been used to replay a different bronze card instead.Remember for the fireball to actually go off you have to actually enable it by playing a card.If I use a blue commando to replay the Ambush and you counter with a gold or a simple removal on said commando Ive just blown my commando for nothing.gtits like when you would just bounce and reuse archers except you get the  damage to the unit before it gets its effect off.Which is working as intended.This is a game of counter strategies mate.The trap counters the common I play  or  cards chains that currently dominate the meta.Indeed its a GOOD addition to the current meta to give players who use chain combo mechanics pause to reconsider the strategy or even change their deck style completely if the meta sees more of these played.So NRSK chain res combos andor First Light chains get interrupted.Why is that a bad or even OP thing?I think its fucking great for the game myself!,gwent,dbhpaz6,5,t5_384zi

10108830,0,t3_5kn4kf,ST is going to be the most expensive faction to get started in. They need a certain threshold of epiclegendary cards to make something workable with.That said theres a lot of different builds floating around. Most of them center around Mercs Commandos and First Light. Aside from them theres still a few people playing dwarves but that seems to be more of a gimmick. The deck is very rigid and also very different from other ST builds. Im not sure Id recommend dipping into dwarves unfortunately.The usual suspects in the mercenary builds are Aglais Milva and some combination of GeraltAard Triss andor Iorveth for the gold slots. Silvers most commonly used include Decoy Ciaran Yaevinn Aeromancy and Natures Gift. Last Wish Toruviel or Johnny could make up the last spot but again decklists are very flexible and metagamedependent.For leaders most of them appear to be viable. Francesca is probably the hardest to use so when learning the deck Brouver or Eithne might be recommended.Most of all expect a learning curve. ST decks are quite different from the other factions and will take a lot of getting used to.

10116676,0,t3_5krzgr,Its a terrible card for the health of the game. Gwent already suffers from playing the same cards over and over being stronger than more diverse approaches which is why the majority of games are playing the same ten cards over and over through three different rounds. Its very onedimensional and not interesting.Shani and Baron are probably the single strongest cards in the game. You shouldnt be able to play them again though this was already possible without Renew. Theres a reason NR plays Renew while other factions dont and its because NRs Golds are absurdly strong. Borkh isnt quite as good but his effect is clearly meant to be a onetime thing. Its frustrating to have to deal with these huge effects multiple times.Gwent needs more diversity not more ways to play the same cards over and over especially cards as strong as Shani Baron and Borkh. All the unbalanced strategies are a result of spamming the same thing over and over.Youll notice all the good cards to Renew are medics. Youre playing a card Renew that plays a card you already playedShani that plays a card you already played Demoted Baron that plays a card you already played Lubberkin that plays a card you already played Reaver Scout that plays a card you already played you get the idea. Theres nothing new happening here and theres no way to stop this. Its just the same things you played earlier played the same way only better this time. Its not fair and its not fun.Aside from medics theres no real reason to play Renew. Aglais is never going to get as much value as Shani Aglais was nerfed because mercenary chains were too strong much like medic chains are. Iorveth isnt great either as its basically just  strength at best in a game where killing a unit is a liability because medics. Baron and Shani will easily get more than  strength every time and will usually beat out other factions golds quite easily in terms of raw numbers.I dont see how Renew stops demote res chains. People demote and replay Baron all the time while they save Renew for Shani.The last thing Gwent needed was more ways to play the same cards again. Gwent needs decks that do more than one thing over and over. Thats what makes games interesting new things appearing things you didnt expect and havent seen before.Yes its a very strong card in NR.

But especially when row stacking is becoming a thing you need to buff your units wisely as to not have some of them have the same strength.I kinda like this because just brainless buffing is as bad as PFI.

10570789,0,t3_5rcrdo,The game is not pw but just like other card games you will hit bumps and have growing pains when you start out. You get rewarded based on rounds won and not always games won so losing is still progress. Once the matchmaking improves in the next patchcoming on the th you should also have fairer games in the lower ranks. The reward system doesnt encourage grinding but is rewarding enough for you to get  kegspacks a day. There arent rerolls but you are given the option to pick  card out of always rare or better from the last card in every keg.Honestly comparing the rewards to Shadowverse might be a little unfair as Eastern games have a different etiquette when it comes to rewards and such.

The ST decks needed to be adjusted I just wish they had a stronger identity because it feels like if youre not playing dwarf tribal the only other ST decks are just a jumble of shit.

Thus the fiiiine in the title which I think was letting us know he was being sarcastic.And its only super easily countered if you happen to have very specific cards in your hand.

Im surprised the game actually runs on a bit version of Windows at all though would have expected it to refuse to run at all.

10929158,0,t3_5w45vd,One of the criticisms I have of this game is that it usually comes down to one or two cards. Theres almost always a logical progression of what order to play your cards in if you know what is possible in the game. So whoever gets the right top deck will always win if both players play correctly. You just play your cards and save your big swing for the end and the one with the better swing wins.

10938553,0,t3_5w73bj,gt Does Gwent have daily quests that are fair and relativaly simple to do?Yes very. You need to win  rounds for the first tier  ore with mini rewards for each bracket one third of the way through so after  wins for the first tier that end up being like x scrap x ore or a random card. You then need to win  rounds for the second tier and  Ore along with the minirewards and if you play a lot in a day  rounds.That means if youre investing a very modest amount of time youre getting  kegs a day coupled with ore from the minirewards and good games it ends up being like  a day besides level up and rank rewards which can be actually substantial.  a week compared to doing your daily quest every day in Hearthstone for  gold on average or . packs coupled with the Tavern Brawl for . packs. If you happen to grind out the wins in Hearthstone for the  gold a day  wins which takes a long long time you end up with a max of . packs a week barring lucky streaks in Tavern Brawl which would require far more time invested than here.gt What is the EpicLegendary drop rate like?About  in  is the common metric for Legendaries not sure on Epic ?. An important point here is that Hearthstone awards about an average dust value of  a pack while Gwent awards an average scrap value of  a keg increasing as your collection goes in both cases obviously. But Legendaries in Gwent cost  scrap compared to  dust in Hearthstone meaning while the dust to scrap cost is slightly in Hearthstones favour opening up that many more packs daily skews the results heavily in Gwents favour per rewardaccumulation time.gt I played Gwent a fair bit in The Witcher  so I know the basics is it more of the same or is there more depth now?.The core basic approach of play a card your opponent plays a card whoever has the highest total wins is still there but its much more in depth. Most of The Witcher IIIs cards were fairly... Static just point values. Here basically every unit has an ability or interaction playing a Special card from your deck consuming one of your own units and adding its strength to yours getting stronger as you damage enemy units etc and those are core to the game rather than lay down strong units and play more spies than your opponent.,gwent,de88h0g,1,t5_384zi

10954868,0,t1_de9wjwg,As you might know Im referring to Richard Garfields argument he made during this talk I feel there is a sufficient number of people who played Hearthstone for a while but want something more skill rewarding this is of course just an educated guess. While other CCGs often offer great gameplay systems I feel they just lack polish or certain functions. I played Faeria for a bit I played the Bethesda one for a bit Eternal crashes my PC Id check that out. But where Gwent stands out is that it has a high amount of polish. I feel Hearthstone is so enjoyable mainly because of the polish the voice overs are just fantastic. Gwent offers good menu design they should surface more information in the UI great sound design great music and even though screenshots look very plain it has a suprisingly high amount of polish. It actually has very hi res textures compared to bloated HS stuff it works beautifully on hi resolutions and so on. So Im only like  hours in I dont know how good the gameplay systems actually are but Im hopeful and I think the game offers not only a more complex approach but a very polished one at that and we didnt have a really polished competitor to Hearthstone yet for example that bethesda game while fun is just soo ugly looking.,gwent,de9x0er,1,t5_384zi

11038172,0,t1_dej5gwu,Scorch would have the same effect in this case basically if you only have small units scorch is better and silver. If you have big units too potentially bigger you risk doing as much damage to yourself than you did to your opponent. The game doesnt need more cards that counter big buffed bronze units. We have plenty of those dimetrium bombshackle scorch borks faction specifics scorchlike.I think that lorewise this card should affect golds units some options to make this card usefull but unable to one shot a  strength gold Kayran  Remove  base strength from any unit.

11038215,0,t1_deixx3j,I cant really agree. Most of the time it doesnt matter what the opponent has. Most of the time we play into a lot of stuff because we have to. Knowing that he has something to me at least is pointless because playing around everything means losing and you always assume your opponent has everything especially if youre playing ranked at a higher level or if youre both higher level in general. Given how much tutoring and card draw there is seeing their hand is usually an exercise in futility. The most that I usually got out of raw reveal is knowing that I should leave which changed nothing in the long run as Id lose either way. Seeing cards is like having a video feed of the other locomotive on the same track going your way. Its effectively pointless in the end.,gwent,dej5uqd,-9,t5_384zi

If theyre buffing and I cant stop them Ill look for dbomb Usually theyll give up card advantage pretty quickly so I can react to weather with clear sky or dbomb a horned row. Lacerate kills  nekkers after spawn and eliminates  from their deck outright. Its usually gg.Unfortunately the reason this meta is stale is because consume monsters and SK counter each other. If you res or consume from graveyard the other person cant have it. gravekeeper counters SK hard and SK wins pretty much every other matchup while monsters is .So theres not a real reason to play anything other than purple or red.

11055005,0,t3_5xtv0l,Control decks are extremely good at punishing these decks though as they are heavily combo reliant.My first deck I created was a Radovid deck. All these uninteractive decks usually lack tempo. At best they will play either witchers or crones but at best they will only win one round off of them usually not because you can get  strength plays every turn while after their tempo play they usually only get .Against ST I would mill for single target removal and immediately remove any resilient unit that ever appeared on the board this has resulted in many hilarious instant forfeits when I remove their rd dwarf. Against Consume I will immediately lacerate after a monster nest draining their deck of nekkers making their round transitions extremely weak.I barely ever lose versus these kind of decks where the cards rely heavily on each other. If you play a control deck and properly ruin their win condition cards the game becomes fairly easy.Of course discard skellige poses a problem to me due to their base strength buffs and carrying rounds over. It is hard to play around as NR.I think the meta is relatively healthy I switch to my consume deck if I see a lot of Skellige and I switch to me Radovid if I see a lot of ConsumeST.

11161485,0,t1_dewvcmh,As far as I can tell the problem with the NR starter deck is that you just immediately lose the game to scorch. You spend the entire game creating a big creature and buffing it up then copy it with your leader card and then your opponent plays scorch and you just have to concede. Obviously you can try to bait out the scorch first but good opponents generally wont waste it before you use your leader ability. You can also try to use your leader ability on a smaller creature to protect from scorch but usually then the starter deck just doesnt have enough power to beat most other decks. You really need to get a lot of value out of your leader to be balanced powerwise against other decks but then youre super vulnerable to scorch.,gwent,dex54zl,1,t5_384zi

11176829,0,t1_deysp0s,Its not impossible that those are pseudo randoms or will be in the future.Thats what they did in Dota for basically all procs all  chances of stun or crit are using pseudo random. Meaning the first attack is actually like  or something and it increases or decreases when you misshit. The point is to make it so the average scenario is just that average and that the  crits in a row become almost impossible. Implementing that in Gwent would mean that in a situation where youre trying to hit a Cow out of  units in total the chances to get it is extremely high and some more extreme scenarios are basically impossible.Im not saying its their plan just that it can be mitigated because if blizzard refuses to ever do this kind of stuff doesnt mean someone else cant.  Its kinda the same as clear sky or whats the name of the one to summon a bronze ?  you cant draw any gold with it and it comes from your deck if the card said any unit that would be retarded but in the current setup its more like play a card you had a very high chance to draw anyway.,gwent,deyvq4c,1,t5_384zi

In hs you get about gold per day via quest and  gold every  wins if memory is right. Thats sooooo much lower then what you get in gwent.Just completing the full tier awards per day gives you  ore which is already  packs. You get additional ore and scrap from the smaller parts of the Daily quests and then you get scrap or ore per gg which you get like  of the time. So per  games playedfor HS comparison you get about  ore or scrap regardless of win or lose.....This is all without rank rewards and level up rewards.The game isnt cheaper in every aspect but if you get more for free your incentive to spend money is way lower.

Ofc you can throw a low str Resilience card and go nd and transfer some adv to nd round so theres many aspects to consider even if Resilience is getting nerfed soon. I see some strategy behind this but what in the case of a tie? You play another card? Or do you flip the coin and good luck? Thoughts?

They want early advantage and tempo to build and carry it on to next rounds. First because they are able to generate arguably the biggest board strength next to consume monsters and majority of this strength transitions to round . So they can pressure a lot.

11289037,0,t1_dfbf1ku,Sure Woodland may have been on the list for nerfs anyway but I dont discount the external factors regarding weather to not have contributed at least in part to this change.  My issue with the Elite change is that its essentially like playing the full witcher combo two turns in a row. Averages . points each turn full combo. Thats a lot of power. And its golden tempo to boot. not like crachwarcrys  point combo that is  scorchable and weatherable or witchershorn which is also weatherable or  dbombable.  Now I will say there are a lot more options for catching up today than in previous times. So I will cede that in practice it may not be that bad. I am merely being extremely cautious because I hope you remember as do I a time when Elites were very cancerous  it was  guaranteed that any NR deck you fought was starting out as ElitesReinforcement.

11322038,0,t1_dffbxuo,gtIf ill start counting other factions deck thinning we will end up with admitting that ST is the worst faction in deck thinning.Yes I remember you being the one who cried about ST deck thinning in the Deck Thinning thread.You can start counting all you want but what matters is this ST has enough deck thinning to go through their entire deck. Thats it. That is ALL that matters. It doesnt matter how many classspecific or neutral thinning tools a class has. If you can reliably draw  cards from your deck then you have enough thinning. And Scoiatael can do that. It doesnt matter if a different faction has ways to thin  cards from their deck because realistically you are not running a deck with more than  cards and you will not be using all those cards in the same deck.gtAnd im just not saying to you that Elven Mercenary doesnt play only First Light. Then maybe you should build your deck in a way where Elven Mercenaries have a high chance to pull out First Light to get them out reliably.,gwent,dffc10m,5,t5_384zi

So the card does have its niche and basically exists for situations where you dont have any units to buff. That being said the card probably needs a buff but Im not sure how useful this one would be unless youre in the same specific situation you would likely want luberkin anyway in which case you are only making bloody baron stronger and not forcing a decision in which card to pick.,gwent,dfgw25t,1,t5_384zi

11352191,0,t1_dfip8wp,Thats because no other passives are incompatible with themselves. I guess you could attempt to perform another coin flip in cases where they both want to decide the starter of the round. But it becomes convoluted with should you be allowed to know if the enemy is attempting to use their ability to choose round order in order for you to attempt to counter their ability with yours? If so and you lose the flip you could even end up going first in  rounds on top of the fact of not having a successful faction ability. This outcome would skew games even harder on the decisions of coin flips. Going nd guaranteed max twice per game is not the same as other factions. You are guaranteed twice. Other factions only have  chance of going nd twice based on coin flip. If against ST they are guaranteed to only get nd once. On top of that ST can choose which round. So in cases where you win coin flip go nd in first round. As ST you have the ability to choose to go nd in either second or third round. Mostly helpful against SK probably. This admittedly is not that an impressive of an ability if you look at it as what have you gained over other factions that win the flip however you are guaranteed nd twice. So more than likely yes they will use their ability first round to go nd as winning first round is a big advantage. Except in cases where theyd rather save their ability to try for the flip in order to try to  someone such as Skellige because of their passive. And even if they lose the flip they are guaranteed nd for rounds two and three. ,gwent,dfir06j,2,t5_384zi

Dbombweather will often win against these cards if timed correctly. By the time youve dealt with reinforced trebuchet it has gotten some form of value both from weakening your board and you removing it. Not to mention goldrez synergy that make it a nuisance.  I view axeman slightly differently because while it does buff off ofdamage it doesnt generate that damage by itself.Edit oh yeah Imperial Brigade gets high strength quickly but again eats weather or a dbomb and like axemen needs synergy from other cards.,gwent,dfp9kcz,2,t5_384zi

Exactly how many points you need to get the opponent to lay down  cards to beat you changes drastically depending on the match and board conditions but its something youll start to pick up on as you get used to the game and the cards.,gwent,dfxxv4n,7,t5_384zi

11576169,0,t1_dg6zdn4,Sure the archertype cards are the strongest counter to Bloody Baron but not many decks run those cards. If the meta is filled with those cards then Bloody Baron is weak. However against everything else Bloody Baron is strong. It should be your first card played in a round so if Manticore Venom or Lacerate hit it and other units that means it already got some buffing value during the round which most likely gave you more than enough value. If Alzurs Thunder is used then you got a  strength differential benefit when the baseline benefit of a gold over a bronze is  so not too bad. If Dshackles is used then you got a  strength differential benefit which is significantly better than if they used Dshackles on YenCon or Borkh.But really the strongest argument in favor of it is in the overall deck performance and win percentage. Bloody Baron always improves the performance of my NR decks over other options and thats why I always run it. Maybe in a different meta a different gold will perform better but in this meta Bloody Baron is great!,gwent,dg85y1g,1,t5_384zi

11794399,0,t1_dgwtwfq,You arent listening to what Im saying. On average we arent playing into worse case scenario. Thats the whole point. You have a Spy for  of the good cases when you can afford the . Such as winning r or in an overwhelming lead. And in the worse possible case you can void that  with Scorch. Obviously its not ideal but the thing is you have options. Something other factions cant do besides NG with Treason. You have a right to disagree.And obviously Im not infallible but I play on the ladder in top  and with my experiences Yaevinns definitely has  paid for itself. ,gwent,dgwxo5c,1,t5_384zi
