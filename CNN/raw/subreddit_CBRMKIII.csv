5931857,0,t3_3wlhbc,Here are my suggestions for the continent No more Poland. A lot of people seem to think Poland is fun presumably as a joke Poland Stronk! and all that but ultimately they are irrelevant meddlesome and they take up too much space in an area wherein Germany needs to have room to expand. One Balkan kingdom to rule them all AustriaHungary or Yugoslavia would be adequate. Replace Rome with Mussolinis Italy since Rome needs more space than it can otherwise get and Mussolini gets bonuses for his coastal cities this should keep Italy strong enough to stay relevant. There are lots of options for Russia. Lets just not do the Soviets again since weve already seen them twice. I personally would like to see Ivan the Terrible Ivan IV but there are many others as well. Nazi Germany is too controversial too unsuccessful and ultimately needs to be replaced. I would like to see Bismarck Wilhelm II or Frederick Wilhelm I run the country and I would also still like to see a united German state rather than just Prussia. I dont know if a nation like Normandy can be counted on to make ships to settle on both sides of the English Channel but if it cant use France and England seperately but dont put any other civs on the isles. The Kalmar Union seems to be the favorite for Scandinavia and I agree with that. Portugal is fun but Spain is more relevant so I would like to see Isabella or Carlos III in Iberia Scythia will continue to fill the Caucasus. If Normandy will settle in the British Isles than so will Iceland which I would like to see lead by the vikings and they can compete for the space. No sense in adding a civ like Scotland just to get caught in the middle of it.,CBRMKIII,cxx73tk,15,t5_3bamm
