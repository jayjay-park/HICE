4084926,0,t3_37c1hu,Pretty consistently hitting around  but I went on vacation and couldnt do a proper weigh in so I didnt nab the weight lost bonus this week. Wound up with  not bad I will take it considering I spent all of Friday driving in a car and my plans for a killer bike ride on Saturday were foiled by my dad who rides his bike all the time but who got dropped a dozen times  minutes into our ride.I try to get at least  minutes of exercise daily between cycling and running and closer to   days per week. I didnt quite nail that this week. Though I took a . hour  mile ride on Sunday to make up for some of the slack.Anyways the only results I care about are those that I can see and feel. And in that case riding my first metric century through my hometown on Sunday was a big achievement for me. I do wish I had thought to have put on sun block though.,ROKCFIT,crlwnxo,5,t5_37u2h

5287701,0,t1_cvnk4tz,Successful teams would be the same as the super groupsteams that people seem to be complaining about and want to stick together.The other teams would be randomly assigned and randomly paired at the beginning. Not shifting every week. I also dont think a massive GroupMe would be necessary. Each small team would have one and the person responsible for overseeing multiple teams would be in each GroupMe. They should be able to communicate any necessary information between teams that are grouped together.,ROKCFIT,cvnkdxd,1,t5_37u2h

5389724,0,t1_cw0dvrw,I mean Im joining the challenge and I think the overall massive whining is way overreacting but...I was thinking about it on my morning run and realized why this bugs me so much. Its like weve become the Planet Fitness of challenges instead of allowing the great to do what they do best we bring them down because beginners feel threatenedchallenged by seeing someone excel above them. So..instead of pushing the bottom up via actual lofty goals and competition were pushing the top down so nobody ever has to feel like there is way more they could be doing.,ROKCFIT,cw0lj0h,4,t5_37u2h
