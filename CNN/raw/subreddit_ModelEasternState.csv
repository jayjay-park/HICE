6709798,0,t1_d0d5vol,Wouldnt this bill people allow people to coexist more easily? Instead of denying samesex couples the right to marriage the bill simply makes certain that clerks in the Commonwealth do their duty of issuing marriage licenses regardless of the couple attempting to obtain one. Its really a question of what is more important to you that all couples who desire to be legally married may do so or that a group of people samesex couples are denied that right due to the personal views of others on the definition of marriage. ,ModelEasternState,d0dcmse,1,t5_3bcwe
8132526,0,t3_4q4rzj,I will not be voting for this due to its tax provisions which are already set in the budget. I also have concerns about THC level detection since what Ive read indicates that these arent reliable indicators of being under the influence of cannabis.If the tax provision is removed I will vote for it though. ujjcreskoff,ModelEasternState,d4u63mv,2,t5_3bcwe

9023676,0,t3_53pnw5,Personal property tax and real estate tax comprise about rds of a county budget see example on p.web   If instead of prohibiting localities from taxing real estate you could repeal Section  and allow both the state and localities to tax real estate amp personalty.  Then state increases as the state assumes some services such as policing and education could be offset by local decreases but you wouldnt force localities to double residential fees for garbage water etc.,ModelEasternState,d7wi6ai,2,t5_3bcwe

9927893,0,t1_db1izk0,As of now it looks like the next few weeks of my work will be investigating the alleged charges brought upon Senator BalthazarFuhrer by the Presidents Administration. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Oversight committee I recently wrote and sponsored a Senate Resolution to create a Special Committee dedicated specifically to the investigation of the Senator which will be chaired by myself cochaired by the other members of the Judiciary and Oversight Committee and open to some participation by all Senators. Im looking forward to hearing the evidence and delivering an impartial and fair recommendation to the President regarding any possible criminal charges and to the Senate regarding any necessary disciplinary measures.Regarding legislation I recently sponsored a constitutional amendment to legalize samesex marriage in the sim. This is my second attempt at passing such legislation the last time it passed the Senate but was never introduced in the House for some reason and Im confident that with our coalitions in the Senate House and states we can finally bring justice to our LGBT citizens myself included. In addition I am the lead author in the upcoming Responsible Healthcare Act which will move our healthcare system away from the unfunded socialized healthcare system we currently have lack of funding basically results in a Bushera healthcare system towards a public marketplace system similar to the Affordable Care Act. There are key differences however between our bill and the ACA. Our bill includes a public option a stronger mechanism for the expansion of Medicaid and numerous other additions that will actually control healthcare costs rather than just focusing solely on expansion of care. The bill will be introduced in the House and I look forward to leading the fight to pass it in the Senate.,ModelEasternState,db1moef,2,t5_3bcwe
