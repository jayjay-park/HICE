911710,0,t1_ch7tvr3,gtYou also have to consider what having Rickie on the team means though. Hes one of the club veterans and having a guy whos a veteran whos willing to take on a different role act as a mentor and not complain is a big deal. Although I tend to give limited credence to the idea of a nonperforming player being worth keeping around due to leadership or being a good clubhouse guy certainly if RRR or DM think those qualities make him more valuable overall than a replacement player he should stay.gtHis production may not be there but his moneys already in the bank at this point. No one wants him apparently and hes better than picking up Alex Gonzales or Yuniesky Betancourt again. Im not sure what youre saying here.  The money is in the bank?  That sounds a lot like an optimistic rephrasing of sunk cost which shouldnt be used to keep Rickie around.  We can either pay Rickie M for Rickies services or pay Rickie M and seek a replacement players services.  The M is gone either way and if the replacement player is likely to produce at a higher level I want him on the team instead of Rickie.  Id take Rickie over Yuni B too but YB is not the only option to consider.gtAs long as the team is successful dont mess things up I guess.I dont agree with this.  The teams success so far has had  to do with Rickie Weeks.  I perhaps value nonstatistical contribution less than you do but keeping a greatly underperforming player around simply because other areas of the team are clicking is not sound general managing in my opinion.,Brewers,ch7x1bx,3,t5_2roak

However with a small market team you gotta build the farm. He has done a good job of keeping the team in contention for the playoffs but I am kinda hoping that something happens that ends up causing him to leave. If last years team couldnt win the dvision I doubt this years team could make the playoffs.

Theyre a big part of the reason craft beer is even as big as it is now and theyre good introductory beers for people who have never had craft beer.

3986632,0,t1_cra27s4,I think he is a very nice prospect but he is outside of a top  ranking most likely and there is uncertainty in the bat and is a high ceiling high risk sort of prospect at this point.Apparently the Phillies have been looking at him recently but only because the Sox wont give up Swihart or Betts and he would be one part of a package of prospects in opposition to a must have.    The Sox system is very deep and he is further down the list.  But if the big names came off the board like Hamels and Cueto or David Price and the Sox are left empty handed there is a chance they would deal him for an upgrade.  hes definitely not untouchable.,Brewers,crapmii,0,t5_2roak

When a player is drafted they start out in the low minors rookie ball its often called and work their way up over the course of several years until theyre ready for the majors MLBBasically a farm system is made better through good drafting and good trades IE well probably trade Gomez away this year since we wont be able to afford him when his contract is up and hopefully in return well get a few good prospects in the minors,Brewers,crt9pb4,4,t5_2roak

He was tooting Mike Trouts horn when he was still a lowly prospect while nearly everyone was obsessed with Harper.  He loved Fiers when he came up actually considered voting for him rookie of the year over Harper until Fiers collapse in late . He also had a bit of a kerfuffle with Melvin when he implied Scooter Gennett is nothing more than a league average player bench guy on most teams. Melvin responded and called him out basically praising himself for giving Gennett a shot but after a couple years I think Law was right again.  I love Scooter as a person but honestly hes nothing special as a baseball player.I may put Keith Law on a pedestal but his track record is nearly flawless compared to other analysts out there.,Brewers,ctolbqd,1,t5_2roak
