3207441,0,t3_2wktb2,As much as I ask the SCA employees I know to be more active on this sub I cant answer the fit questions intelligently. However Id expect that with a  fit comes a very high regard for you.And for the timing question its roughly. Different organizations work on different stress levels NPS USFS etc so three months to one might be within three months and to another could be we want to get it done in the first week of being at least three months out.Ask your regional SCA representative if youre dying to know the answers you should be able to find him or her on your main page of the SCA site.,thesca,coug7s9,1,t5_2vl96
