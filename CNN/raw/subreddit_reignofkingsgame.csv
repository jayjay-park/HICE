3411720,0,t3_2z9you,If you have the port set to UDP and canyouseeme isnt showing your port is active then the problem is with your router. Might check www.portforward.org to see the best way to forward your ports if you dont have experience doing it.Also you dont really need a batch file to start the server all you need is the shortcut with batchmode appended on the end of the shortcut path. The shortcut should look like this        CReign of Kingsrok.exe batchmode,reignofkingsgame,cph5t80,1,t5_37ast

It is not here to promote myself considering its not my channel and he doesnt even know I posted this since I literally had just stumbled into his stream a day before I posted it.

3552706,0,t1_cpx5eab,One trick with this which seems stupid in practical use. Place these under water and place blocks above them but still under the surface of the water. This stops the glow and you cannot see the firepits under the water from a distance away.You could also have your whole base under the water too but just remember to come up for air haha.Hope this helps.,reignofkingsgame,cpx8d1c,3,t5_37ast

3719053,0,t3_305lg7,The rest of the servers guidelines should be followed at all times by ALL PLAYERS. They are as follows          NO Hacking          NO harassment          NO impersonating another member of the community or the Admins.          Admins decisions are final and not negotiable.          NO Hindering another players experience.          NO AttackingRobbing OFFLINE player bases.          KoS is allowed as long as the intended target isnt a fresh spawn trying to gather items.          NO building in or around the Kings throne room or near the ravens tree.          NO building siege weapons in the air.          NO blocking resource nodes.          NO using game exploits.          Attacking or Destroying The Arena will result in instant ban.BOLDWE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE COMMUNITY SO WE CAN HOLD PVP TOURNAMENTS AT THE ADMIN BUILT ARENA. THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL RP SERVER MIXED WITH PVP PLAY IS TO HAVE PLAYERS..PLEASE COME CHECK US OUT.. ADMINS AT OUR SERVER DESIRE NOTHING MORE THAN TO WORK FOR THE PLAYERS NOT AGAINST THEM...PLEASE CHECK OUT KNIGHTSNI WEBSITE,reignofkingsgame,cqg75mf,1,t5_37ast
