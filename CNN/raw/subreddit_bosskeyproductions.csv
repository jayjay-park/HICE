4478627,0,t1_csv6f0h,It was counter intuitive at the time because I was like  at the time and was playing on console. It was my first game with an economy system. I ended up liking it but I think it was one reason why people kind of shrugged it off. It was a barrier to entry so to speak. You have to buy and bind your abilities IIRC. I had a blast when I actually learned how to play it though. I think there are some serious contenders for competitive console shooters. They just end up not being supported that well. ,bosskeyproductions,csv76xt,2,t5_33qle
