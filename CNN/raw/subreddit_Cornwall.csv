3080426,0,t3_2uz8bc,There are simply no opportunities in Camborne. I have no reason to return after I graduate. The attitudes and behaviours of the residents are a symptom of the economic situation in Camborne not a cause. I think Cambornes prospects are hopeless and there is nothing the residents can do about it so what does it matter if the residents are optimistic or not? Everyone in Camborne should aspire to leave and let the town die.,Cornwall,coha8nx,2,t5_2r2lk

8649476,0,t1_d6mr8ta,I take your point the warnings from my uncle about playing on his farm just outside of Redruth may have left a greater impression on my young mind than I had thought. Unusual places to explore both interesting and quite under appreciated. Would be clay country around St. Austell. If you are not afraid of cycling up some hills the high ground around St.Austell can be an eye opener. Even now during the height of summer with the visitor numbers clogging most parts of Cornwall clay country is almost empty of emmits.    Not exactly abandond building but more interesting than many in Cornwall are aware. Clay country for most is that ugly bit of cornwall they drive past on the A. ,Cornwall,d6msp5j,1,t5_2r2lk
