4148549,0,t1_crce0oh,This is perhaps the biggest lie of them all. Local economies grow at the expense of other economies. Contrary to popular belief capitalism requires exploitation at some level. If everyone was living large no one would live large. For capitalism to work there must be exploitation at some level which means that when some people win some people always have to lose. This may not apply in the micro scales you are looking at but from the most holistic view possible but I and cseries have said is true. Someone always has to lose in capitalism. The very definition of profit at the most fundamental layer is the labourcapital relationship and in that relationship the labour always loses. Our current economy consists of almost infinite layers which obscure this fundamental relationship but it does exist. When you reach the final layer you will most definitely find that someone has been exploited for their labour.Marxs research into the true nature of capital is fascinating.,CanadianInvestor,crt5e9k,1,t5_347i1

SampP  is a list comprising of  large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ VIX is an index showing the markets expectation of day volatility.  ShortTerm Futures is basically a derivative contract to buy or sell an asset. These contracts expire after a certain time period so ShortTerm would mean contracts that expires in  months.Putting it together HUV is essentially an ETF that purchases short term SampP  VIX futures contracts. It is also hedged to the Canadian Dollar as these markets and contracts are based in the US.What does this mean? These types of instruments are generally not to be used as investments. Since futures contracts expire they start to lose value as the expiry date nears unless the underlying VIX starts performing well generally during times of uncertainty. The VIX is a notorious for being used by traders to tradehedge around expected major events. You can see by the performance of HUV it has been a loser over the long term but this does not mean it has not done well in the very short term like a day to a week.While it may do well during this very short term it all depends on WHEN you buy it as the trader might have bought it higher and if it is not sold would ride it lower and lower.Also since the value keeps deteriorating these ETFs decay do reverse splits in order to cosmetically keep the share price up you would still be losing money.
