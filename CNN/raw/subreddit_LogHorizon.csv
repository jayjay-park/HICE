237440,0,t1_ceoivp2,The reason people would believe that there is a technological reason is because the new expansion to the game was called NeuroSphere Pioneers and none of them remember logging in.

313117,0,t1_cfbli1c,I think thats the best tactic for the goblins if you place pressure on the blobs the spearhead and raid groups will have to divide in order to keep the flanks from collapsing. And with overwhelming numbers you can focus the enemy into overcommitting and then crush the weaker flank.Its not the best idea since the terrain is so against them but I doubt the goblins can win with a simple zerg.,LogHorizon,cfd825a,3,t5_2yppv

3602407,0,t1_cq2txn2,Ill say. You went from a major character to a bit character really fast there.I wasnt in love with him posttransformation but that version of him also only lasted a good three episodes. He didnt have a comparable cast member in Brotherhood so its hard to directly compare him to anyone except generic antagonist towards the end. I could pick the zombies to compare him to but thats doing a disservice to Archer who actually had a personality.Archers transformed body did adequately represent what he wanted and who he was as a character he was a man who enjoyed war. He was basically Kimblee  nationalist. I would have personally preferred if the making of the philosopher stone had killed him too but I dont consider it a particularly terrible stain on the show. More like a mild shrug.I give the same mild shrug to the underwhelming portrayal of Hoenheim in both shows. Neither bad nor particularly good.,LogHorizon,cq2wev3,1,t5_2yppv

4932942,0,t3_3ham4h,having played a mmorpg Lineage  for quite some time made watching this anime a nostalgic experience to me and since I played Bard class for that game I can connect with IsuzuHenrietta the most. Elder Tale is constructed quite similar in the sense that to fully enjoy the game experience youll need a party going in almost every occasion though the big difference is that soloing is still possible in ET while for L in the earlier game stage some classes are completely incapable of going solo which was changed in a big expansion  years ago. the LH juniorsSeraras first dungeon exploration and the Raids done in Depths of Palm are just ones of the many that actually reminisce me of my newbie amp raiding days though Field Monitor also has to scan for possible enemy players lol though I think Minoris party lacks dps I mean  supports in a party of ? really? and of course the politics. due to the nature of PK friends could turn into enemies and vice versa Ive learned that grudge runs thicker than blood in this game lol having experience at playing mmorpg definitely helps in understanding LH but not absolutely necessary. its still a good way of getting a nostalgia though,LogHorizon,cugc4lc,1,t5_2yppv

6421059,0,t1_cziziu6,I feel you on Nyanta having preCatastrophe wisdomtragedy he and Naotsugu definitely both feel oldermore experienced in that they feel like they know how to deal with things better hence I think they are good static characters.  I dont mean that they have to grow or be dynamic I just wish more arcs had them as the central character.  Although the kidsside characters are all interesting the story really is at its best when its about the original .I really like Naotsugu in that regard since I feel like even though he doesnt really stick out when dealing with problemspolitics he also never really panics or lets his personal insecurities mess with his competency something that cant be said about the youngerstill growing ShiroeAkatsuki.  And haha imig about SeraraxNyanta I never got the appeal for that kind of age gap in a modern show.  I definitely care less in historical shows and i guess Nyanta fits the kind of gentleman you would see in a medieval show,LogHorizon,czjh2sf,1,t5_2yppv
6929124,0,t1_d11jnrc,Woof this is one of the most poorly understood pieces of info out there on the internet.Later in the report you can see what kinds of games women are really playing Solitare Freecell Minesweeper and all of those other little attention grabbers on every PC. So they are playing plenty of games sure but they are only high on the minutesplayed stat because of a high volume of time spent on games that do not have anything to do whatsoever with the same gaming scene that youd find in an MMO.In fact moving over to an actual mmo...over  women are playing World of Warcraft in the US. That amounts to less than half of the fairly small number that they estimated using their own methods. That of course includes the whole spectrum of WoW players  namely the casual players. Out of the women who DO play WoW many fall into the more casual category so if you were to look at the subset of WoW that is hardcore say hardcore enough to be online to play every expansion the very moment the servers open youd find mostly male players with a much smaller proportion of female players. Its definitely not going to be  thats for sure. With data its always important to give it a closer look. This set was cited by people frequently when it first came out as some sort of proof that women have really gotten into the gaming scene but any closer look proved that wasnt the case. If anything the gaming scene is much more multifaceted than before and women make up a huge proportion of the player base of some of those facets but they are still a vary small proportion of the more traditional gaming scene where an MMO like LH would fall. After all keep in mind that most of the systems weve been exposed to about Elder Tale paint it as a more hardcore and immersive MMO than what the genre has been producing lately closer to Everquest in style than what we see now. ,LogHorizon,d11qp85,5,t5_2yppv

10060498,0,t1_dbiq1be,Its actually from a short story Mad Tea Party from a Log Horizon booklet that was released as a reward in Japan a couple years back for sending in proof of purchase of all the novels at the time.It was released a couple months ago to the public along with the Summer Training manga chapter by the LN artist Hara Kazuhiro which was translated and posted somewhere in this subreddit. I know that the other LH manga artists received the rights back for their works in the special booklet but I think they released theirs in their manga volumes.Theres no translation for Mad Tea Party yet but we received a summary from the Chinese fandom where someone got the special booklet.,LogHorizon,dbiwo1u,1,t5_2yppv

My translation skills are still sloppy but reading through my past two days of work suggest some coherence in how I read Japanese.

10213070,0,t1_dc1kmzh,All great input. That was definitely one of the things I enjoyed about SAO was the fast pace of it so when it DID slow down I was able to pay attention to the intricacies. But youre right. As cool as the portion with Kirito eating the food it would have been nice to see them try and fail with preparing it or other stuff.Coming from a heavy game development background I can understand why LH would be appealing to people wanting a slower morethoughtout anime as opposed to just action action action.I think its the same reason that people lump SAO and AOT together.Awesome input.
