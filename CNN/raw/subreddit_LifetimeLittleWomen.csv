9347815,0,t3_58f3fs,I agree that they should have just started a season in Dallas with all of these girls than making them move to Atlanta. I gotta say this show is expanding fast. At this rate there can be a LW show on constantly with no breaks all year long. I do think its dumb that Bri just got back with Wooda and now she wants to move away to Dallas and just expected him to drop everything and follow her again?. It is nice that every new show has a familiar face to help us get acclimated. ,LifetimeLittleWomen,d90widx,2,t5_3c98u
