433022,0,t3_1z1ayv,Ahh.  The glorious first day of receiving. You show up in your bus or van to the front gate of the island mp talks to the driver and yells to put your head between your legs. You drive for what seems like eternity and come to a slow halt. Begin nightmare DI gets on the bus yells at you to speak up lets you know some basic rules and explains what you are going to do next. You exit the bus and get onto the yellow foot prints where you are greeted by more DIs that just seem so over joyed that you are there. They file you into a classroom and start having you do basic paperworkhaircuts and the infamous call home. You do everything in the first  days except sleep. They will keep you up for the first couple days. You will meet a set of drill instructors but they wont be your actual instructors that will teach you everything you will need to succeed. This goes on for about four days then you will meet your main instructors and the training will begin. Im sure I missed something because I went boot camp in . But Im still here in the corps so they must of done something right. Any more questions just ask. ,marines,cfpnbih,3,t5_2rqox

844236,0,t3_23rp61,Youre not going in as an  are ya? It could mean that your MOS school start date has changed it could mean too many in that MOS and theyre just waiting for them to get out it could also mean a restructuring of that MOSs requirements. Youll have to ask your recruiter for clarification. As for the Buddy program unless you two are in the same platoon youll never see him until you get to MCT. The guy I went in with was in the same platoon as I but I hardly ever saw him because he was like  and Im  so we were on opposite sides of the squad bay. I think its just an excuse to get ya to sign and ease your fears. But dont worry about it though. ,marines,ch08rle,5,t5_2rqox

6798290,0,t3_48v3ad,To answer your questions sort of. The only way to get it corrected is to talk to our boot camps Battalions STraining section. If you can get the rosters with the correct scores you can get them corrected. Otherwise yeah just wear what is in MOL. Honestly it wont affect you much. Youll requal and repft before you rate a composite score for promotion anyway. And lots of Marines dont bother wearing the nd rd....ect Award bars. No one really cares. ,marines,d0mvmsj,3,t5_2rqox
7189885,0,t3_4dxpea,Not everythings about money.  You aint gonna get financially rich by being a Marine so thats kinda important to keep in mind.  Come over to rusmc and ask the same question there.

10397991,0,t3_5otayn,I hope you know that if you fail brc you are in the needs of the marine corps if you enlish with a recon contract they dont transfer you to regular infantry anymore you will most likely get some shitty job. I would of enlisted regular infantry see how it is because your mind will change after boot camp and after you see just what regular infantry does going straight from high school to high speed shit like recon is a terrible idea imo.,marines,dcmofvr,2,t5_2rqox
10521690,0,t1_dd0l132,Marines were definitely my top choice but I also looked at Army reserves. Didnt seem like too much of a difference but I also noticed they can deploy for up to  months while I read marines was .
