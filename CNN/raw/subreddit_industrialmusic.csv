Ogre gets loads of attention for his personal projects as well.cEvin Key though now he is underrated.

3318888,0,t3_2y4eh7,Ive followed C since around the release of Imperium and have learned to appreciate most all of his music through his words. There is just something deeply fascinating in the narrative. Perhaps it is a sense of permanence. I honestly dont know.Some of the early work definitely falls under the industrial category though. But its a minority in the vastness of the catalog.Speaking of which Im really a hound for albums even entire discographies and I tend to listen from start to finish once in a while so a few months ago I started at the beginning and wound up a couple of days and  tracks later at the end. I found I could not stand to listen to Black Ships Heat The Dancefloor. Yeah yeah... I know its supposed to be a humorous thing but I couldnt get past it. I think that is due to the extreme contrast of that when compared to pieces of  serious musical art like All The Pretty Little Horses and Soft Black Stars for instance.TLDR I love C! except Black Ships Heat The Dancefloor and maybe The Fall of Christopher Robin ,industrialmusic,cp6ky3o,1,t5_2qyml

9679150,0,t1_da61yyy,From what Ive heard Al sent over everything in his vault to Cleopatra so the box set should account for all of the Wax Trax! studiosoundboard recordings.There are still several songs from the early years waiting to see release. The first batch come from the March th  show at the Misfits venue in Chicago. Its a semiprofessional recording. A roadie recorded it with stereo audience mics. My only guess is they were excluded from the set due to the sound quality not being up to par.Those songs are Knowledge Dancing Alone Le Stupide Funkamental and The Urge To Runaway.  Heres a link to the surfaced material Theres also the Arista period which has its own set of rarities. There are earlier incarnations of the With Sympathy demos as well as an unreleased soundboard recording from their performance at the Hollywood Palladium. That show featured the unreleased tracks So So Life and Hard Man. A professional video recording exists for their show at First Ave in Minneapolis but all the versions out in circulation are heavily generated.Then theres some  live material such as Do You Even Like It? and Rickys Hand which currently exist as horrible sounding audience recordings. ,industrialmusic,da65qh9,5,t5_2qyml

11756275,0,t3_67p482,Like Ill give it a listen sure but if theyre sample video on their Facebook page from a bit back is anything to go by Im not getting my hopes up. Its aggrotech vocalist preset  with equally generic beats. Honestly I listened to them a lot when I was younger but after Companion in crime was such a disappointment I went back and listened to a lot of their catalog for a bit trying to find what made me like them so much for so long. Still having a hard time finding it. ,industrialmusic,dgslqcv,5,t5_2qyml
