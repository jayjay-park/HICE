2702384,0,t3_2r0g8b,Its a jrpg. Fairly traditional for the most part in terms of dungeon crawling though in base P you can only control the MC. The PSX era games and the PS era games dont have much to do with eachother and probably arent connected and the PS era games are the ones most people prefer as the PSX era games didnt age well. P and P both have a lot of nondungeon character interaction  and the MC gaining relationships with people and strengthening them makes his Personas more powerful through the power of friendship. Personas are essentially stands from Jojos Bizarre Adventure.  The power of the soul incarnate pretty much. The MCs in P and P are able to swap between different persona which all have different stats weaknesses strengths and abilities.The spinoffs P Arena Persona Q P Dancing All Night dont really matter. P Arena does continue the story and the other two are apparently canon though PDAL isnt out yet but dont really affect the enjoyment of the main games and likely wont affect P very much so you dont have to bother with them if you dont want to. Persona Q takes place halfway through P and halfway through P even though P takes place three years after P. I havent beaten it yet so I have no clue how thats going to work.For P Arena if you want just the story from that then get Ultimax buy the dlc that gives you the story from the origional and buy Adachi. Margaret and Marie dlcs dont add additional story bits to the game.For P the definitive version is PFES though P Portable is fun as well since it lets you control the party members and gives you access to a female MC. FES has an additional story that takes place after the main game though called The Answer which isnt in PP.For P the definitive version is P The Golden. If you dont have a Vita then it also helps to know that all of the PSP persona games and P The Golden also work on the vita tv thing which is half the price of a vita.Sorry if I rambled on a bit. Didnt get much sleep last night. Its a great series if you enjoy jrpg style combat and anime tropes lots of power of friendship in P and later. P is also a darker than P and is generally considered to have the superior story.,velvet_room,cnb91ft,2,t5_2wq0t

4265369,0,t3_39sj75,Very worth it. I enjoyed P more than P. Its got a slow start for sure but it does pick up rather quickly. Theres more story going on than in P where in between saving people in the TV it just seems like theres casual banter and exchanges for the most part.,velvet_room,cs6fbea,5,t5_2wq0t
4336891,0,t3_3anrkn,Its ridiculous fan service. Ive grown to love SMT because of how dark the series can be. And even P was more dark than most RPGs and that game had a mascot as a character. So the idea of a dancing game based on an M rated franchise does feel weird to me,velvet_room,csehx2r,-3,t5_2wq0t

Since theyre a part of the persons consciousness its likely that it just disappears.,velvet_room,d4zd35j,5,t5_2wq0t

9080149,0,t3_54n2dw,Its best to complete a dungeon in as few days as possible just so that you dont waste any days on dungeons that you could otherwise spend on stats and social links. Its very difficult to rescue Yukiko all on the first day but by the third dungeon or so its not too hard to complete it all in one day I think been a while since I played. Once youve rescued her you can go back for more grinding if you want so thats nothing to worry about.,velvet_room,d83abny,5,t5_2wq0t
