5455821,0,t1_cw90532,Congrats!. I recommend dumping your EEPROM and HD lock code and saving it to your PC in case something goes south. Having those can mean the difference between a simple fix and a dead box if something goes wrong. I have a closet full of them from the latter.  If you can find an original xbox memory card I also recommend putting the SID Save game onto it now that your softmodded. the next time you softmod it will copy over and make the process much faster and easier.Edit More info. ,XboxModding,cw916z0,1,t5_2y16v
