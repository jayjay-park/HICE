218622,0,t3_1wmab0,A few days ago I picked up a piece of moonstone and tried to meditate with it the other night. I swear it completely rejected me because I could not focus and nearly had a panic attack. I took it and the red carnelian I bought that day out of my room. Theyre currently under the new moon with some selenite. Maybe the moonstone wasnt meant for me or Im not ready for it yet. I felt a very intense magnetic attraction when I picked it out though.,Crystals,cf3chcl,1,t5_2tg20

5461771,0,t1_cw9c3se,Thank you so much for elucidating me on the topic. You explained in a way that makes perfect sense to me. Cats are such fascinating creatures! I have a shiba inu and each day I am surprised at how catlike he is. Since he is such a sensitive creature I am learning more about the world we live in just by observing him. I thought I was the one raising him but it might be the opposite!  Since using crystals on myself I wanted to try on my pup to help with his reactivity and fearfulness he has from being a puppymill dog. I did notice that grounding stones like tiger eye seems to calm him and talking to others about it makes me sound crazy! I adore the relationships you have with yours cats I can feel the love from my end ,Crystals,cw9sk2j,2,t5_2tg20
5493030,0,t3_3qb7hg,I found a lot of help from The Book of Stones by Robert Simmons and Naisha Ahsian..  If you are ever wondering what the metaphysical properties of the stones are this book is the Bible.  There are some nice mantras and meditations for each crystalstone.  My best advice is to spend time with each crystal individually and get to know them apart.  Carry them in your pocket place them by your bed or whatever you wish to do.  Eventually you should try pairing them together and try to take note of any thoughts feelings you may experience.  Good luck on your journey! ,Crystals,cwdsb11,1,t5_2tg20
5735684,0,t3_3p9j87,I would try a local rock shop they are all over the country  I sell wholesale to  states.  Most of the time you not only get a variety of crystals to explore but you also have a great resource in the store owner to ask questions.  As for fake crystals its been said that China is developing some fakes and cornering the market on other stones.  Most of what you will find at a rock shop is real stone.  Fakes are hard to pass against rock collectors and energy workers.  If you start getting into more expensive stones the obvious and often questionable one is MOLDAVITE try to get a little more background on the stone before purchase.  Also if the stone makes you happy to look at and hold does it really matter the true origin?  Just a thought. ,Crystals,cx82gdb,1,t5_2tg20

9489229,0,t3_5aqlio,I am a massage therapist. Where I work I can have crystals in my space and use them if I want to. Most client I have want straightforward massage with no energy work so I usually just keep them in the room for my own benefit. The owners of the last place I worked didnt want crystals around. It was too woo woo for them. But yeah I know many massage therapists and energy workers who have crystals in their space. ,Crystals,d9ir0xe,4,t5_2tg20

10202456,0,t1_dc0fjyp,i dont think its apatite which has more striations. agate and jasper are the same mineral  agate is more translucent and usually banded while jasper is opaque. ive used aqua terra jasper in the past and it has that exact same webbingcolor which is why i think thats what it is. jasper in general is an inexpensive mineral. aqua terra jasper is quite lovely though so you should enjoy the piece regardless!,Crystals,dc0i7e4,3,t5_2tg20

11579250,0,t1_dg8hrnl,I just mean.. Putting the crystals down in a grid. Im not sure of the exact definition of a grid but I think its basically a spot where you put out the crystals you want to use.
