Their mission to scout out and report back but in true Minuteman fashion missions never go to plan.StaringJesse Lovette  Dani BirtlesJim Constantine  Spyke OHanlinDevin Cage  Spyke OHanlinThis production is primarily a university module. It was created for a final piece for the BA Year  Research Experimentation amp Development module. Due to having to hand it in this feature is created preGECK and as such contains continuity errors and a lack of lip sync however I have done my best in the time allotted to create a smooth viewing video.I suffered many crashes during filming which set me back more then I would have liked. For example the battle scene took me over  attempts to film having to set up the NPCs after each crash.I am very much looking forward to continuing this story and building a varied series on different characters and groups after the GECK has been released and the game is more stable.But for what it is I hope you enjoy it. This is my first official Machinima and I am proud of what I have managed to produce.,machinima,cyj8m34,1,t5_2qqk5
6299312,0,t3_41wcmz,The playlist I linked are my first two attempts at using theater mode in Black Ops  to make some actual stories with the game.Id love some constructive feedback from the community as I would love to continue doing this.Ive loved learning the camera system and the editing so far as well as getting everything set in place to be just right and taking countless hours to do so.Thank you again for watching and for any constructive feedback you might have.,machinima,cz5nspx,1,t5_2qqk5

7821009,0,t1_d3v257d,Go figure I saw that video too. Perhaps I shouldve worded my query better. I just got inspired by The Vault Recount and After The Fallout But since sometimes the commands especially tc can be wonky I guess the best thing for me would be to wait until it has more mod support.,machinima,d3v5ayz,1,t5_2qqk5
7826474,0,t1_d3v5ayz,I personally do the followingEverything easy like  people just talking to each other with little camera movement and such I do with Console commands and mods. Everything hard like needing to have people move around follow specific paths I do with Creation Kit. Also custom NPCs are definitely safer when done through Creation Kit.I do agree with most of vlifemovies tips though but sometimes the CK is needed just to reduce the hassle. Need an NPC to walk from point A to point B with loops and turns or anything? GECK. Need a custom house objects or navmesh? GECK. Need characters to say dialogue with proper lipsyncing? GECK. Also like Matty said most of the ideas from Skyrim CK transfer over to F. So watch a couple videos from there.,machinima,d3vrg5m,1,t5_2qqk5
7869066,0,t3_4n26gu,I host a machinima group that has voice actors original music producers script editors and machinima directors from various games. This seems interesting. Would you be down with hopping on our discord server some time to have a chat about your project? If we are interested and see something that could work well be willing to provide free voice actors and other services that are needed. ,machinima,d40k0ud,1,t5_2qqk5
