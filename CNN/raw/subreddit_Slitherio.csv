7315554,0,t1_d29njqz,You realize FOV is directly tied to window ratio right? The game uses a pretty flawed system to calculate it make your window skinnier and you  can get an FOV advantage the mod just takes that and allows you to slide it.,Slitherio,d29q951,4,t5_3ddl4
7317021,0,t3_4flh96,The technique I used avoid any situation with more than one other snake. The key is to play it safe you need to stay alive not collect as much energy as fast as possible. Go to the outside of the map where it is empty. Use the minimap to locate other large snakes near the outside and track them down. Once you see their head wait for them to attack you. Boost so they dont gain the advantage and wait for them to make a mistake when attacking. Then only you can counter attack. Rinse repeat amp stay safe ! I hope this will help some of you !,Slitherio,d29w97j,2,t5_3ddl4
7329228,0,t3_4fpmxn,First learn to watch for the circle and avoid it. Once you are circled you want to circle in the reverse direction as wide as you can so it makes it more dangerous for them to shrink the circle. If you can boost into a head on collision then the smaller snake wins.Your hope is that they get tired and move on. If you have any length at all then you are out of luck.,Slitherio,d2ba7so,2,t5_3ddl4

7443429,0,t3_4h8g1p,I was really surprised at how much easier it is to play during the night. I dont know what it is but none of the good players are on. Im also surprised at how long it took to get to k not that this is anywhere near the record. It just got boring past a certain stage. Hopefully they can add some cool mechanics for the game when you become really large.,Slitherio,d2o9qyg,2,t5_3ddl4

8250677,0,t3_4sf19r,Its extremely profitable for me. I made it to k by just doing extremely large circles on unsuspecting snakes catching about  different ones at time. Id patiently wait until all of them killed eachother and  was left and then I would quickly tighten my circle to be extremely small. With each iteration Id gain k. I made it to k in under an hour with this strategy. Circling is the way to go in this game.,Slitherio,d58w2yq,3,t5_3ddl4
