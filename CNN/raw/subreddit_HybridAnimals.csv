3178010,0,t1_corbi8p,Drop bears are just koalas that have been raised on their original diet of carrion fruit and anything that came within range of their claws or teeth rather than pure eucalyptus leaves. Because of the higher energy density of the original diet koalas raised on it grow to be up to twice the size of ordinary koalas to sleep half as much and to move a lot more. Theyre aggressively territorial rather than asocial and they regard humans as threats to this territory  and theyre not wrong since it was habitat destruction that saw most of them reduced to a stunting and soporific diet of eucalyptus leaves.You probably wont encounter any drop bears if you visit Australia unless you find a particularly unspoiled bit of forest in koala country. If you do encounter one youll be written off as a tourist who failed to prepare properly for a hike got lost and was never seen again. Like Tasmanian Devils drop bears can bite through your bones and will leave it to their digestive systems to work out which bits of you and your pack are food. ,HybridAnimals,coredt5,0,t5_2whve
