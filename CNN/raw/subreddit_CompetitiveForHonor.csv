Even if you lose mid and they have their point with no one on it and mid you are getting the same amount of points they are cuz you get two points for defending. Also person on the point may get bored but i guarantee you get the most points and level the fastest. Now the thing is of other people learn this strategy it should add more competitive gameplay and more fights on points because someone will eventually have to steal the others point to take a lead.

Seems way to long of a chain to be guaranteed but I have a feeling I might be missing something. Agreed on the deflects the timing to land it is just super dodgy har and feels quite risky given how just a few hits on the valk can swing the whole match. This Ill own as a practice thing on my part will work on it. Regarding the sweeps I rarely ever do them now. Maybe its the folks Im getting matched up with now but  of the players I go against dodge it on the first attempt even if I throw a few different options first.

You now have to press it AFTER they guard break you on top of this if you press the button twice in a row it automatically fails you so dont spam the button.If you want to feint with the Kensei then I would feint a side heavy and go for a light top that generally works. If you want you can try to bait them into attacking with a heavy instead of parrying then parry them and get in a free heavy. I almost always feint my unblockable finisher.

10836986,0,t1_ddxfcyq,The thing to consider though is to  of the playerbase the gameplay mechanics are fine and balanced for them. They win games they lose games. A very small percentage of players are actually playing at a skill level high enough to actually notice what you guys are pointing out.So the question is do you balance for the top  and risk making the game either too easy or too difficult for the lower  or do you balance for the majority  and leave the top level suffering slightly?Look at the guard break changes from open beta to launch. They changed it to be a slightly higher skill cap at launch and look at the outrage it created. A very very large majority of the player base doesnt want the highest skill ceiling possible. They want something they can turn on after work play for a few hours and win some games and feel skillful about it. What most people do not want is a game that they have to feel like they have to sit and practice hardcore for hours to just to feel like they are good enough to duel someone. There has to be some compromise and with that some mechanics will seem too hard and others will seem too dumbed down. ,CompetitiveForHonor,ddxrb8z,2,t5_3bbel

10840488,0,t3_5uzmw1,I imagine that its intended. Ive had it happen plenty of times and it feels intentional. I dont think its lag because its happened in all manners of matches for me and on every class matchup that Ive had. My guess is that its because the startup of heavies are intentionally made to be vulnerable to basically everything since you can still feint during them so theyre considered an inbetween of Defending and Attacking so theyre still able to be interrupted. Im not sure entirely how I feel. On the one hand I think it might be good for lower tier players so that they are able to use Guard Break even when theyre a bit slower. On the other hand though heavies are already basically unusable at high levels except in very specific cases on a minimal amount of characters. I do think that giving Heavies a bit more power and making guard breaks simply fail and break against Heavy attacks would make them a significantly better option. It also seems to break the generally rockpaperscissors mentality that Guard Break beats Defense Block Parry Dodge Defense beats Attacks and Attacks beat Guard Break. Its certainly something Id like to see Ubisoft look into at the very least. ,CompetitiveForHonor,ddy4be8,20,t5_3bbel

While this may cause the glitch to occur it is something that assassins should be doing along with other things anyways to successfully get attacks off.  Also the zone attack will always come from the same direction.

Or just extend the forward dash which also makes it a risk move but it adds a bit of range to Orochis kit.,CompetitiveForHonor,de25f38,1,t5_3bbel

Off a GB do a side heavy followed by a shield bash and then another side heavy and another shield bash etc. if they keep getting hit by it. As long as the shield bash connects the heavy attack followup is guaranteed. Since you get a guaranteed side heavy off a GB use the GB to begin the chain of heavies into shield bashes until youre low on stamina then back off and regain stamina.

Combos are pretty much useless heavy attack is something you dont use at all other than to cancel into Shield Bash immediately. Also theres no such thing as guaranteed knockdown combo. The only way to have guaranteed knockdown is to guardbreak enemy. What you call guaranteed is performable only when a guy you fight against doesnt know that he can dodge it and panics. Right now the only guaranteed combo would be Shield Bash into GB because they think youre going for the sweep instead they dodge way too fast and then you have landed guaranteed GB. If youve landed successful GB youre better of just doing heavy attack into some lights instead  there are literally no benefits to knocking someone down you waste stamina and you deal no damage. Then again you can still break the combo just by dodging Shield Bash which doesnt require crystal sphere to read the future or super human reflexes. You can both dodge Shield Bash and Spear sweep  dodging in any direction doesnt require roll or specific direction to dodge  in other words Valk doesnt have a Vortex where you have do guess right to get out of it you can do it completely on reaction and without being a Flash. Dodging attacks are nice  if they work and they rarely do. Window is smaller than on Assassins deflect with combined with latency added is a reason why you will almost never see a Shoulder Pin being used. Also shes not fast.

10898318,0,t1_de4267j,Honestly in a Valkyrie v Warlord matchup with the current Valkyrie kit a bit on the lacking side its going to be incredibly tough to beat a good warlord. In a v no gear no feats situation your mobility and your distance are key to fighting the warlord. Keep a step or two away and use your sidestep dodge attacks to your advantage.The best advice for any class matchup against any other class play to your strength not theirs. The warlord is defensive in nature. Dont be aggressive with him. If you allow the warlord to engage you rather than the other way around you will have an advantage. The warlord has three main gap closers. Headsplitter leap headbutt shield charge. Everyone has forward dash guard break but those three are unique to warlord. As a Valkyrie keep on your toes and keep a spears distance. Throw some feints try to bait him into leaving his defensive comfort zone and attacking you and then punish him. If you see him dash toward you but not close enough for him to hit you prepare to sidestep. Hes either going to attempt a headbutt or a headsplitter leap. Exploit his vulnerabilities when he makes himself vulnerable. He will create his own openings for you to exploit you just have to be patient and then do so when they are presented.Also keep an eye on his heavy attacks as once hes  through the animation he cant be interrupted or staggered.Valkyrie is weak right now. And fighting a defensive kit like warlord or conqueror is going to be a battle of attrition. They will hurt you much more easily than you will hurt them. Dont let them be defensive. Make them be aggressive toward you make few mistakes and capitalize on theirs. ,CompetitiveForHonor,de431h7,3,t5_3bbel

He is definitely not as good as warlord warden or even PK. he has no offensive option besides his top light which is insanely predictable and if the enemy can learn to parry it you become  useless.Not to mention you get a free Gb by blocking his heavies and side dodge attacks. Its actually pathetic luckily you are usually not in Gb range when blocking his heavies.The only thing Kensei has going for him is slightly increased range along with his decent mixup and GB damage. It basically comes down to if you can land a GB vs a good player which is never a good thing to base off how good a character is.So do you like spamming top light attack only and relying on Gb to do most of your damage?

10900947,0,t3_5vqj6z,Highly disagree. Atm there isnt even an option to quit prior to a battle so there needs to be an option to at least quit some time during the battle. It doesnt happen often but I can tell you how annoying it is for me to queue up have something urgent pop up irl hit the quit button only to realize there is a noticeable delay which ultimately forces me into a lobby. Great now I have to wait for everyone else to ready up and then wait for the battle to ready up before I can even attempt to quit. I dont understand why I cant simply quit while Im waiting inside a lobby. Of course I can just ALTF but seriously do I have to do that every time this situation happens to me or anyone else?

What uAoRaJohnJohn said above is true the wardens vortex is pretty damn strong right now as quite a lot of the community doesnt seem to know how to counter it or their chosen character has no way to counter that vortex outside of unlock rolling away into reset. Keep at it and you will get better.  Try to poke here and there with lights learn to feint heavies and parries and include those in your kit bag.

10922334,0,t3_5w06gx,I think you should play what you enjoy the most. Orochi and Warden playstyle is so insanely different. I mean all assassins are compared to standard classes. The thing about Orochis is like you say that they are common and by the time you face good opponents they know pretty much all the standard plays. One thing that I find hard when I face a good Orochi as PK is when they go forward  dodge  light overhead. After that they do a storm rush gt cancel into a forward  dodge light overhead again or just no cancel at all. The light attack tracks a lot and has a ton of range. But if you try to parry it or dodge they can actually follow through with the storm rush resulting in the top light double attack combo afterwards. Weaving between feinting the storm rush and not throws me off.Guard breaks that usually follows doesnt work with the teching.When I face good Orochis on my Kensei its usually a combination of light attacks to righttop and zone attack just like the Warden but the opposite direction. The Orochi zone attack isnt as good as the wardens but its good for chipping of health in neutral.Also dont use zephyr slash in neutral. Its super telegraphed and easy to parry. ,CompetitiveForHonor,de6k9ls,1,t5_3bbel

10956908,0,t1_dea2l6l,I would say lawbringer is a solid choice against Orochi but that this fact is true for almost every character Orochi and kensei in particular are both basically useless past a certain skill level atm.    Once you get to the point where all of your opponents are basically feint proof with gt parry rate their toolbox looks awfully empty.     PK usually winds up beating out LB because of the guard switch delay. It makes it impossible to successfully fuzzy guard the zone indicator bug. Warden doesnt actually need his light attacks against LB losing them is a blow but LB is so slow that the warden can still have a solid gameplan without them.    For what its worth I still enjoy playing Lawbringer for fun from time to time Had a brilliant mirror match showdown last night in elimination where me and another Lawbringer parried each others unblockables back and forth  times in a row repeatedly in a single uninterupted chain it was ridiculous but we were both playing Lawbringer both had our execution down pat both had our parries perfect and it was incredibly satisfying.

11093235,0,t1_depd931,You have completely missed the point of this entire comparison. It is not saying x character has . damage more on Y skill this skill is always going to hit this skill is better than this skill etc. The fact of the matter is if something is even remotely viable it should be listed. Zerk doesnt have any zone tech like Nobushis For the record your zone attack tech is in the category of fast attacks. Do it fast enough and its faster than a Warden zone by a mile and even PKs from what I can tell doesnt have an unblockable like Nobushis regardless of how you want to say it can or cant be avoided is literally the shortest ranged character in the game has the least health on par with PKs doesnt have a full block which is a significant advantage against characters with fast attacks that you need to constantly guard against as well as avoiding the blocking bug doesnt have the option of hidden stance even though Nobushi does have the option of dodging doesnt have the option of confirmed hits which bolsters damage regardless of how much you might want to argue that there is no feasible way its even remotely possible to land your second light hit even with hidden attack skipping to it has equally as slow attacks that wont beat guards and they cant even use their infinite combo which is the entire point of the entire class.Youre arguing each individual skills viability and that you can perfectly dodge each and every movement at each and every second without taking into account the fact that the point of the comparison is that even having those options puts you above other classes which dont because theyre certainly not unviable just hard to use at absolute worst. If everyone was playing  optimally at all times to the point where everything you said makes every single bonus option you have invalid then even the viable classes wouldnt be viable because everyone would be perfectly avoiding their attacks. That is not what is being discussed nor the point of my original post. The viable classes are only viable because they have more usable options hence what were checking right now. For the record what were confirming is Which of Nobushi and Berserker has more options for improving their feinting and attack in general improving their parrying and turtling in general and gains more efficient trades when they actually land an attack? as these are what determine which character is more viable regardless of whether overall theyre still unviable. The answer is still Nobushi.Regardless Ill answer the issues.gt What do you mean by unpunishable?The point of a parry invalidating heavies in this meta is that it amounts to a free GB. If it wasnt for a free GB its simply not worth parrying the heavies. A single light attack which only works if you were close enough to the opponent doesnt outweight the risk of messing up heavy timing.gt Those still arent fast.Name even a single other nonviable character that has an attack faster. Literally no character that isnt viable has fast attacks so why even bring it up? Youre not comparing them to the viable characters but the other nonviable ones. If you cant name another character with something better then your character is in the exact same position as every other nonviable character and pointing out slow attacks is invalid as a comparative point as to why Nobushi is any worse than someone else.gt What does range have to do with attack speed?It means you have the advantage due to distancing. The only time range wouldnt come into consideration is if you are literally as close as you can possibly be to the enemy. As an example a Zerk throwing an attack at his max possible distance is midrange for a Nobushi. For the Zerk to land the attack he has to reach the full possible swing of his attack. For the Nobushi she only has to reach half her maximum distance due to the attacks being thrusting and their hitboxes reaching earlier.gt I suspect that Bersekers feints also cancel later than Nobushis would have to see frame data for that though. Nobushis cancel so early that its not really reactive.Thats a complete assumption. All heavies of the same speed cancel at the same speed. The slower an attack is the later it cancels but the easier it is to parry. The fact that Nobushis cancel so early means that her heavy attacks are faster than anyone who would cancel later which is a boon not a detriment. If someone can block and parry  frame attacks given that you said they arent fast since you brought it up earlier then there is literally no reason that any feint of any caliber that cant followup with something faster than  frames cant be blocked just as easily. So your point about multiple feints is irrelevant especially given that you can feint multiple times just  less than a Zerk and  less than the average. If you didnt beat someone with the first feint you wont beat someone good at turtling with any number extra. Also your note on stamina consumption of hidden stance isnt an issue either.  stamina for a borderline confirmed dodge is nothing and the stopped stamina regen only applies if you dont attack. If you attack it immediately begins to regen stamina. Zerk has to wasted  of their stamina on the feints you seem to love pointing out and theres literally no follow up so half the time that doesnt amount to anything.gt The fastest attack out of hidden stance is one second.No its not. Its  frames. The animation of the spinning chops the fastest dodging attack are slower. Thats not including the dodging animation frames either. Youre confusing hidden stances timing and the attacks timing combined not the timing of the attack itself. The attack would only be one second if the opponents attack was ending as hidden stance begins not that youre dodging an attack with it. The point of timing hidden stance is that if you use it reactively to a heavy attack or in prediction of a light attack you can land your following light attack at the same time as the enemys recovery frames. If you end your hidden stance as the enemy is entering recovery frames regardless of light or heavy attack you land a free hit. Its not a permanent  second its variable based on timing. Hence why I specified timing in my post. The difference between hidden stance and a dodge is that the hidden stance doesnt telegraph the direction of your next attack nor at you at risk of being punished anywhere near as badly. I was pointing out the poison bug because its a bug Nobushi has in general for free damage not just off hidden stance attacks.gt This is just falseMultiply the light damage values on this sheet by  they beat the average of every class bar Kensei  my bad shes got the second best light damage on poisoned enemies. Not a huge difference. Youre also only considering the first values of each of your attacks not taking into account that hidden stance skips you to the second part. Is it risky to do at times? Sure. But its far less risky than someone committing to multiple feints in a row with far more reward than what a Zerk would receive. You also cant just ignore the top light just because its  frames. Were acting under the basis of what do people get out of landing an attack not can people land an attack consistently.  frames vs  frames is negligible in this case. If it was  frames vs heavy attack frames sure but its not. What also youre not taking into consideration is that your secondary side lights are the equivalent of  damage given that they have a confirmed hit. Youre cherrypicking.Saying Im judging it based on a level where you can hit light attacks is a fallacy and you arent taking into account the intention of the paragraph which is the very first sentence. Its to determine what potential you do have when you actually land an attack on a turtle not assuming you can land attacks in general. Youre taking each individual point as its own individual point rather than trying to show what each class has in addition to the baseline. If its assumed no one can land an attack what happens when they do who gets more benefits?gt I think your issue may just be you not knowing how to play against NobushiI have said literally nothing about my matchup vs Nobushi. I am not comparing the two classes as if they were fighting each other I am comparing what each class has when youve determined a baseline. This has literally nothing to do with how I fare against Nobushi and if you must know Nobushi alongside Valk is the main class I practice against specifically because she has the blockignoring bug  so dont say it has to do with not knowing how to fight Nobushi.Nobushis unlocked zone attack a certain angle has practically  reactable frames. Saying just block this side doesnt change the fact that its a tool that no other class has. Im sorry but unlocking and turning takes less than a frame or two. Its faster than PKs light if you have it down to muscle memory. Its just gimmicky but its easily one of the most viable moves on your kit. Heck I will literally record the speed I can do it at if its really that big of a deal.Edited Put the summary up top instead of down the bottom because Im not interested in encouraging more X value vs Y value arguments as they have literally nothing to do with determining which characters do have more options and which dont.,CompetitiveForHonor,depepd4,3,t5_3bbel

11097880,0,t1_dephnyd,Perfect evidence.Here you go man Literally just count the frames. Its  frames nowhere near single digits. I didnt think Id actually have to prove that. Thats  frames at  FPS. Her side lights are  frames for comparison.Still even when the evidence you provided is actually clearly in my favour I went and recorded my own test. The fastest attack I got was  ms still slower than her side lights at  ms. The zone attack itself took only  ms but I really doubt you can trigger it literally instantly off unlock. Thing is my weapon clearly hit the enemy model before damage was dealt. This is because attacks in this game dont just instantly deal damage when the weapon model collides with the enemy they have startup frames and active frames. Even if you spin around so that your weapon is inside your opponent you still have to wait for the active frames to deal any damage this means any unlockspin tech is going to have a skill cap. It doesnt matter how good you are you cant pull it off faster than the active frames allow you to.So basically it ranges from slow to fast light speed depending on how much time you can cut down.

11157500,0,t3_5zavd4,My Quick tips. Id say stick with a single character and learn every in and out you can until you confidently know the strngths and weaknesses of all other toons. Id recommend Warden as a starter since there are not a lot of moves to learn and he is a very balanced and versatile class and considered by myself and many to be Stier.   . There is a lot of memorization and reaction that happens. you want to recognize what each opponent does and move by instinct and in doing so increase your reaction time. In this way For Honor is more a kin to Mortal Combat with Dark souls as an inlaw. More info on how your brain works here . The arrows show you directions of attacks but if you watch and learn the animations you can see their attacks before the arrow comes up giving you a few extra frames to react to. Playing the story on realistic enforces this as arrows are disabled. . Learn the character you are playing. Repeated for emphasis. I also main berserker and can help you out after work tomorrow. PM me if interested . Play vs bots. Exclusively lvl  bots. Each day I play I start off with a best of  vs my weakest matchups. eg. I struggle vs warden as a player not necessarily mechanically and therefore I play vs the lvl  warden bot a bunch.  This is both a great warmup to start the day and necessary practice for Tip . . Only relevant if you decide to branch off from your main Each day you play only play that one character all day. Each Character plays differently and your habits on one character will certainly bleed into the others if you alternate toons after each game.  . Gear matters. you wont be able to make use of that sweet  Gearscore Revenge setup immediately. I would prioritize Defense as . It will keep you alive long enough to learn from your mistakes mid match and adjust to your opponent. amp are Exhaustion recovery and Stamina regeneration.  would be Health gained on execution. Dont worry about sprint speed. You will always be slower than your high geared opponent. . Learn from your mistakes. The game is pretty fair overall. Learn to take retrospectives after each win and loss and see how to improve. At worst go back to tip  and play against bots and learn that characters moveset.

So its parry  Gb gb  pounce  light  sweep  heavy  light  sweep  heavy.I cant find the damage sheet to give you the numbers but itll bring a raider down to  hp at least.

I guess you can try to catch them in some soft of whiff for top light after storm rush but its just practical.  One thing that might be doable with hurricane blast is to activate it than cancel it with the light on reaction.

Dont parry anything else just focus on blocking and CGB. Raiders quickest attacks are all ms which is easy to react to.

11203880,0,t3_5zlutw,gt And hes not wrong fighting games have had a history of having rubberband mechanics that allow for some impressive and jaw dropping comebacks. But if the purpose of Revenge is to offer a comeback mechanic for those that have fallen behind in a v then it does an awful job at it. This whole statement is correct but got me thinking that there is a solution that would allow revenge in a v scenario while keeping it  relegated as a comeback mechanic.My thoughts would be that you can only build up revenge in a v when youre down to  bar of health or less. Any actions taken prior to that would have no effect unless you were in a vX.This way it would reward people who play smart and defensively towards the end of their life bar while simultaneously challenging their opponents to try and finish them as quickly as possible to prevent revenge from filling up.Revenge gain would need to be slightly increased since it would be next to impossible to fill up an entire bar of revenge at its current gain levels without taking more than  pts of damage but this would prevent the problem now of the winning player already being ahead from playing more passively and also having his revenge meter built up to just secure the victory.gt My solution would be to completely remove Revenge gain in Duels. And for Brawl and the v modes only to allow Revenge gain from hits if the player has been the target or taken damage from a third party in the last  seconds. Only problem I see with this is you could get gained up on and finish one opponent all the other guy has to do is play passiverun away for  seconds and hed prohibit you from ever finishing your revenge meter. Even if your revenge meter is at  youll never be able to get the last  since its now a v and therefore you wont ever get a handicap to make up for the with the fact you were double teamed earlier.By using my new proposal for revenge gain at end of health in a v it would allow you to now trigger that end of life revenge much easier since your bar would be starting partially filled and you might only need a few blocksparries to get the revenge meter topped off. Id keep the current timer of  seconds too as  seconds seems too long and might force a lot of time wasting activities since no one will want to engage for that duration.,CompetitiveForHonor,df1y1n4,1,t5_3bbel

The game is perfect for it. different team comps different strategies for holding taking points different feat comps etc. I think it could be a fun and competitive mode if the community gets behind it. Unfortunately the community is trying to just push the game towards v competitive only by saying things like  the only way this game can be competitive is by v and v. Why?

It would be great for blocking to become active faster while also making attacks faster so the game feels more responsive. Another issue is the input buffer on all actions making timing anything irrelevant while also making the game feel very nonresponsive. The final straw for me I would say though is basically every single thing tournament players do the devs just say oh well that is an unintended bug. I really cant think of any viable strategy that is currently used that hasnt been called out as a bug. It makes learning the game in depth currently pointless.,CompetitiveForHonor,dftsdxw,3,t5_3bbel

11473072,0,t3_63nscl,Kicks are easy to punish vipers retreat is too telegraphed makes you extremely easy to parry so be careful with that one sidewinder form both the light and heavy variant of it but mostly the light cause audio cue are pretty easy to parry if you throw them out without mixing it up first if you ever zone attack ALWAYS cancel the second hit and preferably unlock and turn  degrees to your left so the startup frames of your zone connect very quickly. Also one of the most useful tools Ive found is using Hidden Stance to cancel startup frames on either a heavy or light attack. Basically Hidden Stance is a feint button with dodging properties and it lets you feint light attacks. Its pretty damn good plus if you land one hit you get the nd one as a guaranteed bleed poke due to the feinted light counting as a hit though obviously not doing dmgAlso I main a Nobushi in my experience while she can perform very well as a simple long range harassment build dealing out a slow death via interrupting pokes I find she shines as a momentumbased fighter. Play around with those combos. Your kick should never be an opener unless your opponent doesnt know the matchup and isnt that amazing use it midcombo and remember after that kick your dodge into a side winder comes out REALLY fast. Also light after a kick its a guranteed bleed poke. Feint into GB during these mixups your opponent is going to be desperate for the parry during this.If youre in danger parry. Pretty much the best tool in Nobushis kit for defensive play since her range usually denies the enemy a good punish off her being parried so if you feel pressured turtle up and try to parry or use your dodgeblock to gain distance. Your lights come out fast enough that you could just pull a PK and throw out a predictive light in an attempt to interrupt your opponent too. ,CompetitiveForHonor,dfwguif,3,t5_3bbel

11481673,0,t3_63vaik,Prior to the patch I used my DS controller out of the box with no special software or utilities. It worked great had the correct button prompts in game and everything was fine.There was a time I tried to make the the DS steam controller support bullshit work out. I put a lot of time into trying to get that thing working correctly and man oh man is it a shitshow.Right Analog Sensitivity    This is a huge problem. Basically steam makes your right analog stick a mouse touchpad with no way to change it. ???? and the sensitivity is completely based on your ingame mouse sensitivity settings. Also when you use feats that have aimed targeting there is absolutely no way to make this not suck massive donkey ass. Basically youre fucked here but lowering the sensitivity within steam and lowering your mouse sensitivity in game will help a lot. Eventually you will have to decide what you care about more reliable camera controls   reliable feat aiming  Hint You dont get both.   Guard Toggle  So within the Configuration menu in big picture you have  tabs.  for Gameplay  for Menus and  for Guard Mode. These are all mostly lies and the moments at which each of the modes are active is super buggy.For instance if you press start and go into the pause menu while in the middle of a match your Gameplay hotkeys are still active and your hotkeys will impact your usage of the menu. More on that later...Guard Toggle is another fun example. In Gameplay L is bound to Guard Toggle. This same function is bound in Guard Mode on the same button. Makes sense right? You need to be able to toggle Guard Mode in both the locked and unlocked state so having the same hotkey on the same button in both modes makes perfect sense. Well jokes on you buddy these hotkeys actually conflict with each other.Heres the scenario   You are in the unlocked state meaning your Gameplay hotkeys are active.   You press the guard lock hotkey L to enter guard mode.   Upon activating the key you are immediately put into the guard mode hotkey state for your controller.   The game detects that you are currently pressing the Guard Toggle hotkey.   The game removes you from Guard Mode and your Gameplay hotkeys are active once more.  In case that wasnt clear you press L once and it will lock you onto a target and then instantly unlock you. If you spam the fuck out of the button you will eventually get lucky and get a lock through but it takes a while. Super cool eh?Swapping Hotkeys  Lets say I wanted to switch my Feint key to L and swap my Quick chat to Circle. Should be simple enough right?Wrong.Sure in game you can make this happen but it will now become completely impossible to use the quickchat for Good Fight! or I Got This! as they was bound to the Circle button within the quick chat menu and even though youve clearly swapped the keys it doesnt care.  Menu navigation is now completely fucked. You cannot navigate left through tabs as your L no longer serves that function. Circle doesnt do it either but L will exit the menu. So it half works in probably the worst way possible.All of these issues just made it so much more difficult to actually use the controller. I initially fucked with all of this before the patch under the pretext that I wanted to swap feint to a more usable hotkey. I eventually decided that it wasnt worth it and that by trying to make all of this stupid shit work I was just handicapping myself in different ways and fucking with my muscle memory for typical game use.I ended up disabling the steam DS support getting rid of the legacy gamepad ini entirely and just rocking default. Yeah feint feels like its on a shitty button but with it being so god damn difficult to rebind keys I dont think Im gaining enough by swapping it to something else. If I could get used to GB on Square then god damn it I can get used to Circle feint and I did. I sure do wish I could move the Guard Toggle Swap Target off of R though...That is...until this patch. Once it hit I was no longer able to use my out of the box controller support and all attempts to validate files modifying the legacy gamepad ini file and anything else I can think of will not work.I am forced to use this shitty steam controller emulator that valve has built and that For Honor halfhaphazardly implemented. Now Im fucked. Thanks Ubi.EDIT I was able to get my controller to work with the normal nonsteam based controller support.Use this for your legacy gamepads ini.,CompetitiveForHonor,dfxg1bs,2,t5_3bbel

Ive found that most have a couple variations of set combos they try to use so concentrate on blocking the lights to stop the chains and then be prepared for side dash spam and zone cancel spam. ampnbspIn duel and brawl mode I just walk them into a corner blocking and then use my faster attacks to cancel their attacks and guard changes and I look to push them at low stam so they exhaust themselves and I can punish them.

Of course the players job is whatever they want in the tournament. I said that if more had chosen to not prioritize winning over healthy gameplay then the game would not have died so fast.

11661855,0,t1_dghqrlg,gt  The fact you mentioned that someone used the vortex  times in  minutes more than once every  seconds and then go on to imply that isnt a problem shows that actually it is you who is stubbornIve asked numerous times why its a problem. You have not provided a single explanation as to what makes it so awful. gt an totally ignore all other combosmoves and just use that method. So this is what it comes down to you dislike the fact that a certain tacticmove is becoming dominant. Thats how competitive gaming works. I  guarantee you another character will become dominant not that Warden even wins anything and youll be bitching about that too. People complain about PK all the time  she cant setup a Vortex. gt Stamina is not preventing them.But it would be if you gave every character an unblockable with stam drain that could be chained and setup a Vortex. You dont like that because its the same move over and over.We should really do something about all these Stuns in Dota. Its just a spamfest.It may be the same abilities but doesnt that take knowledge of cast times cooldowns mana and positioning?No its a spamfest. GG dude. Its spam. I dont like Vortexes.gt You never even addressed my solution.Because its not a solution at all. And its becoming tiring to explain basic game terms to someone who has little clue of what theyre talking about.gt a player can afford to vortex every  secondsAlright Im going to give this another shot. Vortexes are not moves theyre situations that arise because of moves. Furthermore the Vortex is impossible to enact against Raider because he can break it  with cgb on dash. Theres no Vortex in the match above.Back to your proposed solution. If Shoulder cost as much stam as Wardens zone itd be a very weak move. You could just roll every time and Warden wouldnt have the Stam to continue any pressure.Characters like Lawbringer Warlord or Conqs bashes would be turned on him very quickly even after one shoulder Warden would be on half stam. Now couple that with parries draining half your stam being hit by other unblockables and the stam cost of attacking feinting and gbing at neutral Warden would have pitiful amounts of stamina to make anything happen at all. And Warlord Lawbringer Conq and valk still have s they can inflict on you at exhaustion. Youd essentially kill the character and his only safe plays would be entirely defensive.,CompetitiveForHonor,dghvwtz,1,t5_3bbel
11668464,0,t1_dgimllq,lol youre fuckin clueless kid. The axe is the lowest damage of any thrown item besides kunai and the trap takes more than a second to place and is very visible in the ground. Plus neither are infinity spamable. Also wtf cheap attack has died the zerker have that isnt punishable I be been playing him since closed beta and I was unaware of this cheap move? Can I hit someone with my shield and then get a free hit and repeat? Lol play zerker then kid and after you get your ass handed to you then go back and change your view points because youre lost brah.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgimwmn,3,t5_3bbel

11698384,0,t3_66xcly,I dont think they did. I like that they shortened the GB window into cancel but dont really like anything else. If I could strike one nerf from the list it would be the ms recovery on feint Id replace it with a higher stam cost. They kept the spam like you said but made it hilariously easy to just poke the Warden and theres nothing he can do about it. At least before if you predicted your foe would attack you you could cancel and parry and then mix it up again. ,CompetitiveForHonor,dgm13pv,2,t5_3bbel
11705465,0,t1_dgmsiil,As a berserker against a light spamming PK I just do what they do. I light spam them back and soon chop if their attack timings get ahead of mine. Most PK players are so conditioned to applying pressure with light spam that theyve never practised parrying and rarely block.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgmu57w,1,t5_3bbel
11709546,0,t3_671plw,Not by much. I can only foresee chip damage increases really benefitting Raider and Berserker everyone else would have a mild improvement. These two have methods of sneaking heavy attacks in relatively safely the threat of a softfeint to stunning tap and being a feintgodhaving to decide early on if its a light or heavy for parry timings sake whereas on every other character its pretty easy to parry the heavies especially if you are looking to parry heavy attacks only and ignore lights. ,CompetitiveForHonor,dgnb1wi,1,t5_3bbel

11710953,0,t3_673lyu,you do realize they arent only throwing out ms light attacks right after another while chaining right? that is the core cause of the block issues against valk and pk light spam. AFAIK beserker can be blocked and parried by any character on all of his attacks even the faster ones. this may not be true though im not the most experienced player with heavy classes,CompetitiveForHonor,dgngshx,5,t5_3bbel

11719819,0,t3_676hgt,With the state of the game the way it is now with bugs and balance problems I dont think exploits glitches and bugs etc can be avoided if the top players want to win. Having said that I think its ridiculous that theyre even in the game and Ubi are embarrassing at times.It is the devs fault not the player. Still awful to watch though. ,CompetitiveForHonor,dgogxiz,8,t5_3bbel

11741945,0,t3_67js5q,I main Raider and Orochi. Unfortunately theres nothing we can really do against LB since their soon to be  can start from a block AND they have one of the most damaging light parry punishes in the game. Not to mention after a couple blocks and a shove youre out of stamina.I know its lame but your only option until Oro gets some sort of opener is to alternate between top lights and zone abuse the flicker while youve got it!. Once youve hit them a few times theyll usually become more aggressive. Then just sit back and parry their face off. Against someone who can react to the Orochi zone and parry top lights all day youre just sort of screwed.The final option is to just outturtle him which is even more lame. I get a lot of hate when I play Raider Im actually a super aggressive player for the most part because I just start turtling when nothing opens the opponent up. I have the luxury of going for environmental kills to tilt people which Oro doesnt have.The key is patience I suppose. If youre playing to win then use the above strategy. If youre playing because you saw the trailer for this game at E and went oolala then just play however the fuck makes you happy and learn to accept defeat. When you play how you want to play its that much more satisfying when you get those Dubyas.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgqz9n1,5,t5_3bbel
11745486,0,t3_67gc5p,please no. I dont like how everybodys solution to balance is give all heroes s. they just arent fun imo. valks mix up  fun and engaging. wardens mix up guessing and frustrating you dont feel good when you get out you feel lucky. Same with new lb kinda  I might be in the minority here but I just hate that mechanic.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgrdpkg,1,t5_3bbel
11746491,0,t3_67lgow,It does bring another bar into play to watch not that  bars would be too many but it is definitely near the upper limit for how much detail people can take in and monitor at once. I like the idea and mechanic but isnt this really just a stamina bar by another name similar to using stamina to block but a new resource.The issue with the defensive meta isnt so much that defending is better than attaching but that doing nothing is better than either attaching or defending... really it should be called the passive meta. Your idea would be good for encouraging offence over defence but we need something to encourage action over inaction. Maybe a combo meter ,CompetitiveForHonor,dgrht7h,10,t5_3bbel
11756558,0,t1_dgqvs37,It isnt I have the same issue as LB and its absolutely infuriating.

11766830,0,t1_dgtrh7f,That hits people. Also theres no free gb if you follow up the light with a heavy after they dodge. In that case you will have to dodge and wait then parry the heavy. nobody does this but we tested it day  after the lb changes.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgtstwy,3,t5_3bbel
11767234,0,t1_dgsv89r,I would argue that it is still technically a vortex because rolling isnt a solution to it. Sure it lets you escape and normally simply escaping would be enough to break a vortex in fighting games but obviously this game works a little differently. Rolling also can be beaten by the Warden.I understand your explanation but I dont agree that the definition has changed.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgtuhc0,2,t5_3bbel

11770854,0,t3_67yovc,Turtle meta is weird on console. In my opinion you can get away with throwing naked heavies more on console because everything is harder to block. I toss out random stuff constantly and land something  of the time. I could be playing trash people because Im not self proclaimed sweet player but I dont really see the turtle meta on console like I do on pc streamers. ,CompetitiveForHonor,dgu9ab4,17,t5_3bbel

11771867,0,t1_dgucl5o,The turtling hurts so bad. Her heavy and heavyfeint animations are painfully different from her lights and slow so they rarely catch people offguard and the timing of the second light in the chain is parrybait to skilled snapping turtles.Unlock tech helps purely with flipping sluggish turtles onto their shells. You also have the mixup available to throw a light or heavy as the finisher to the combo but they generally get blockedparried.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgudfku,2,t5_3bbel

11779567,0,t1_dgv7r9u,Well I offered the point that maybe there is no easy counter to conq as lb so if your looking for an easy conq counter youll have to play a different character. Looks like no one here is saying LB is OP we are saying he is currently no fun to play against. Due to his cheesy play style like PK.Your responder simply stated that when pointing this out we get downvoted by lawbringers. While getting downvotes for unpopular opinions is how reddit works pointing that out should not be considered useless bitching. It is just acknowledging the facts of the situation.Just because you didnt like our points doesnt make them less valid. Thanks for taking the time tho.,CompetitiveForHonor,dgv9299,0,t5_3bbel
