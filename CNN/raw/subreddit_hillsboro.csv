4659692,0,t1_cths1tl,I do know that South Hillsboro has been given the green light but I honestly like the idea they have for it.  The city wants to make an area with larger homes and nicer shops and such. Higherincome families are working in Hillsboro but living in Cedar Hills or Lake Oswego or the West Hills.  It would be nice to have people who worked here live here shop here pay taxes here etc.  Otherwise all that money they make in our city is being spent elsewhere  that and it makes traffic worse with the commute. ,hillsboro,cthwt8h,2,t5_2tf4i
