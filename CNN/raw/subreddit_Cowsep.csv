4758941,0,t1_ctubk8t,gt Ive opened something like  Toucan boxes over the last couple weeks while going after a Megahorn and didnt find any books in those. Granted the books should be in odds so that could just be rotten luckThats fairly bad luck but not completely unbelievable. For  trials youre looking at a  chance of at least one legendary.gtI heard someone else say not too long ago that theyd opened  dragon boxes and gotten no book there either though.That is really rotten luck. . chance to have gotten it in that many trials.Maybe there really is something funky with the odds. It would be nice to get confirmation that everything is working properly though... even though I have my scribes already from donation.,Cowsep,ctuerl3,1,t5_31mhz
