2082594,0,t3_2ioc58,For some reason dubstep seems to be the most.common music on esports streams which isnt necessarily bad its just the really loud chainsaw style stuff that seems to be chosen. I always liked the old skool more dubby dubstep hence the name with heavy reggae and dub influences and which is actually quite nice to listen to. Tes la rok  round the way girl is a good example of this. Much nicer ,RoomOnFire,cl4jkke,2,t5_32ov5
