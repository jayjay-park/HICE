8721577,0,t1_d6vtgsa,Weird... I tried searching under all variations of IdolConnect Asterisk Live with spaces and without etc. Didnt work. I was definitely logged in to JP iTunes. I ended up having to go to their YouTube channel where I was able to select their name that is written in Japanese characters Katakana?  and copypaste it into iTunes and THEN I was finally able to download the thing. For future reference here is the direct iTunes link to it,IdolConnect,d6vu6cv,1,t5_3fwqk
