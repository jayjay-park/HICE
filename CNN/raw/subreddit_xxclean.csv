3640471,0,t3_320zgj,Thanks for making this sub! Im a fan of rxxketo and risplenty but this sub seems like a better fit for my eating goals But hi! I was diagnosed with PCOS almost  months ago and Im currently at least  pounds overweight. I gained the weight over the course of a year after some lifestyle changes moving across the country with my bf and away from my favorite yoga studio when I stopped taking my birth control it really started to pack on. Ive lost  pounds since my diagnosis but my loss has plateaued for the last  weeks so one thing I can do is start being more disciplined with my eating habits. My idea of clean eating is cooking from scratch with whole foods. For it to be clean for me I also watch my sugar and starch intakes. A little about me Im  live with my bf of almost  years and our cat. Im currently battling a bout of depression and social anxiety but I hope to start hair school soon! ,xxclean,cq78ovj,1,t5_37rfv
