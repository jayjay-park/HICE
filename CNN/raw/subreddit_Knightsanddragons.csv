2328118,0,t3_2lz5l2,A little background I only just started to play recently and have progressed to the point where Im starting to get epic armor. I fused the earthwardens and I got really excited thinking wow if every epic armor is k right after getting it I might as well keep trying fusions until I get another piece.. A few days later today I got the blazeborne. And what a disappointment that is. My question is why is there such a gap on armors that are the same rarity?,Knightsanddragons,clzgvex,1,t5_2xuyy

The best bet is to try and get into a decently performing guild to get strong epics dragonforged are still fairly rare and usually only for top  and sometimes  guilds. Also look on the top performing lists for epic bosses arena etc. and add a bunch of them to your friends list. If you can get  well geared friends that should help a lot. Its a slow process being a free player but Ive been able to succeed fairly well with it. Just dont expect to have the best armors available.,Knightsanddragons,cxveaqm,1,t5_2xuyy
