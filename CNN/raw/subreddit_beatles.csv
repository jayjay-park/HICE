449485,0,t3_1z7ud7,Rick Astley was a prophet too.  When he says were no strangers to love its really about how love is inside us all and we may not always recognize it but its there all around us. When he says you know the rules and so do i he is referring to the fact that the rules or nature of love is set by a higher power and if we are open to receiving it we will be fruitful.  Is there a deeper meaning behind the Beatles music?  Sure but not in the sense this article portrays.  You can find whatever meaning you want behind their lyrics.  One of the beautiful things about art is that it can be interpreted many different ways to many different people.  Rick Astleys Never Gonna Give You Up can be a simple song about love or a meditation on Love as a whole.  This article is implying the Beatles are prophets and treating certain interpretations of the Beatles lyrics as dogma that is inspired from somewhere to give us spiritual truths. Doesnt this seem a bit much?  The Beatles are a great band with great music and many great qualities.  Im sure when they came out they may have even seemed like a force of nature as the article states.  But they were not prophets though bigger than Jesus. Fun read though for all its ridiculousness. In ancient Egypt a beetle was the symbol for eternal life another coincidence? Yes. ,beatles,cfrcrmf,13,t5_2qt7l

The Abebooks page you linked to doesnt say much about the contents but I did find this in another listinggtCompiled from interviews given by Lennon over  and  the book was due to be published by New English Library in April  but was pulled at the last minute. There are several theories for this the strongest being that the publication might jeopardise Johns already troublesome application for his US Green Card a fight that started following his deportation in February  up until being granted permanent residency in July .Any chance you could upload the contents page or info on the sources? Id be interested to know which interviews were included and if any of them are unavailable elsewhere.Its also strange that Lennon was able to block its publication if that theory is correct. He shouldnt have had that sort of influence over publishers who had presumably licensed the interviews from the copyright holders. Also if it was a compilation of  interviews youd imagine the US authorities would have heard it all before.Perhaps he paid off the book publishers to get it withdrawn power to the rich people.,beatles,cg4uj62,2,t5_2qt7l

2239688,0,t3_2kt1ia,I dont think Yoko was much of the problem or even a catalyst that drove the band to break up. The real problem and catalyst was the death of Brian Epstein. After his death Paul took on more and more responsibilities and that caused problems with John who still considered the Beatles to be his band. When Yoko came along and joined the band managerial and financial problems had already reared its head in the Beatles and as a collective whole they began to realize that while Brian was well intended he may have lacked certain key skills in protecting their interests and capital. After Brians death the Beatles experienced monetary hardships that they struggled to understand especially considering the value of their name brand and songs. These problems led Paul into the managerial offices of Lindas father and brother while Yoko urged John to take back control of the band and wanted Allen Klein. Allen Klein appears to be a despicable man that created more problems for the Beatles than he ever managed to resolve and his interference in the band caused more problems than anything else per the organization and daily interactions with one another.On top of this Yoko did add a lot of pressure and problems to the creativity of the band. Paul and John had began to grow distant and in their separation they lost a lot of the spark that kept their musical cohesiveness together. Moreover with John still insisting that the Beatles were his band while Paul was literally doing all of the paperwork to keep it together their relationship began to deteriorate quickly. Yokos creative pressure was not nearly as damning as the control issues hence Paul storming out of the studio declaring that he quit. Additionally George felt snubbed and still stifled creatively with only one or two songs allotted per album. Ringo always seemed happy to be along for the ride perhaps realizing that they were the luckiest people in the world but also realizing that it was transitory in nature.Ultimately the final contract the Beatles had to fulfill does look like it was destined to be their last given the perfect storm of managerial problems Eastman v. Klein leadership problems Lennon v. McCartney and snubbed feelings for creative expression Harrison v. Ono. To your point though is Dont Let Me Down a musical and emotional breakthrough for John? I think so. Johns music was always more personal than anything else and Paul was known for trying to appease the masses more than anything else. John did struggle with his identity and his selfworth which is obvious when learning about his life. I still find it adorable and sad that John Lennon suffered such stage fright that he almost was unable to join Elton John on stage for what would be his last performance. Is Dont Let Me Down a plead to Yoko? I suppose it could be but I see it more as a plead to Paul and the Beatles. Thats who he needed to keep himself up and together even if he didnt fully realize it at the time.,beatles,cloini0,12,t5_2qt7l

3686288,0,t1_cqb4cli,Good observation.I think a lot of these Brian didnt do a good job latterday interpretations are confusing the issue. In reality Brian didnt get the Beatles a rotten deal. He got them a standard deal and in the early s the standard deal was a rotten deal. A really rotten deal. Only the power of the Beatles really changed the standard recording contract which evolved over the next few decades largely due to their clout and their outspokenness about what had happened at the beginning of their career.To put it in perspectiveIn Mark Lewisohns latest book Tune In he mentions that George Martin tried renegotiating his contract with EMI in the early s preBeatles to get some amount of royalty from the records he was producing. EMI refused and Martin considered quitting but no producer at that time at least in the UK was getting any royalties at all. In  or  when his contract was up again he quit formed A.I.R. and from then on he was an independent contractor working with the Beatles at EMI facilities which was the only way he could actually get any royalties from EMI.Further look at any contract of any band that signed before the mids and they pretty much got the same bum deal. The only band I know of who actually got a good deal was the Stonesand they did so precisely because of the Beatles bad deal juxtaposed with their phenomenal rise to fame in . The Stones signed with Decca who was desperate to sign the next big thing after turning down the Beatles the year before so they gave them ownership rights to the masters and a larger royalty rate than any other band signed at the timeall this most likely because their manager Andrew Loog Oldham had worked under Epstein in the Beatles early days and knew what to expect.Going back further its interesting to read about the deals that artists were getting in the preBeatles era. Bing Crosby didnt sign a great deal until  with Decca after two decades of fame. Of course under that great deal Decca underpaid him and his estate filed suit over it about  years ago. Crosby like many other musicians made most of his fortune from things other than singinglike merchandising TV and radio specials and owning a stake in Ampex and the Pittsburgh Pirates.For his part Epstein did recognize the unfairness of the Beatles initial deal almost immediately and Apple had begun organizing under him in  before his death so he was trying to get them a bigger piece of the pie as soon as he could. The issue was that he had no bargaining power in nobody had any idea how big the Beatles would get and how fast. They could have just as easily flopped and EMI may have taken a loss on them.A lot of the criticism of Epstein stems precisely from what you pointed outJohn and Paul were particularly displeased in retrospect as they watched a bunch of businessmen get much richer off of their work throughout the s than they themselves did and they blamed Epstein for it. Though when they took their turn at playing businessman things actually turned out worse. At first anyway. Paul and John wised up soon thereafter and  both enjoyed good business deals in the s after nearly a decade a famenot unlike the Bing Crosbys who came before them.,beatles,cqcgmdm,2,t5_2qt7l

When you use tape loops to make music you are making the music less accessible to the common man the essence of rock is that it is reproducible with enough practice. Tape loops completely negate that and therefore I dont consider it real music but I see weve reached an impasse and you keep ignoring things I say and insist that Green Day deserves nothing so Ill let myself out.,beatles,cqhpkb3,1,t5_2qt7l

Although I personally feel like The Beatles have a much better overall strength of catalog and the fact that they are more popular though popularity isnt everything if you remove them from history the musical world is much more altered than if you took out the other two. This is because Led Zeppelin and the Stones mostly popularized blues music that already existed perhaps doing it better than before but playing a role that any other band to replace them couldve done in the right situation. The Beatles on the other hand took from multiple influences and then crafted their own sound which was so innovative that they pretty much flipped the music industry upside down to achieve it. Basically The Beatles created something totally new and are much more irreplaceable whereas the other two though amazing bands that I enjoy were mainly bringing sounds that already existed into the mainstream.,beatles,crc87i2,1,t5_2qt7l

They only feature the songs in mono from Please Please Me to Revolver but at least its something. Theyve also released all of the mono versions of their albums on vinyl minus Abbey Road and Let It Be as they were only released in stereo from the original analog tapes so if you have a vinyl record player you can get those separately. The only way to get every song in mono on CD in the official order that the Beatles intended is through the mono box which will set you back a couple hundred.

YouTube also has a lot of BBC documentaries posted by users that havent quite been caught by the system yet.  If something was from the BBC its usually a good music documentary.One of the reasons for this is that the BBC does not have to negotiate or seek approval for synch music to picture from rights holders for domestic broadcast so shows they produce for the UK about pop music actually have the real music in the show.  In other countries notably the US producers do and its almost always denied by the Beatles who prefer to tell their own stories  in outlets like The Anthology series the upcoming Ron Howard BEATLES LIVE movie and boardapproved exceptions like George Harrison Living in the Material World available on HBO GO and HBO NOW.USproduced lower budget Beatles documentaries or those flown in from the UK and reedited for legal reasons are easy to spot by their use of soundalike Beatley music.,beatles,d29gcvx,1,t5_2qt7l

Paul probably has the most raw talent across the board but there isnt a single skill of his singing bass playing composition etc. that comes close to Ringos level on the drums. This is a man who almost never had to use a metronome in the studio and Exhibit A Woohwee thats how you upstage a guitar solo.Exhibit B Anyone who plays drums knows its pretty tricky to do a leadinleadout fill while singing and not have your voice falter.Exhibit C I have no words for the insanity going on here.,beatles,d8afpdg,29,t5_2qt7l

9477365,0,t1_d9gstmx,its strange how many people feel this way about a lot of their more funringopauls granny shit  songs. While i might not like them as much as strawberry fields forever or a day in the life it has its place on the album. You start with Taxman which is really sort of spicy and sarcastic then theres Eleanor Rigby which is beautiful and sad you continue with Im Only Sleeping which is mindblowing with its experimental sound so is Love You To both have those space truthoftheuniverse great lyrics. After that we get back to love in a beautiful love ballad that Here There And Everywhere is. And then Yellow Submarine comes in and were kids and we dont care about all those deep things we have a great song about seas and submarine sung by uncle Ringo with all the effect and Brian Jones singing in the chorus. And i love the little hidden darker meaning of we all live in a yellow submarine. After the song you get She Said She Said  a psychadelic greatness.

9623284,0,t3_5crkf3,Of all the celebrity deaths this year this one is one of the tougher ones. I had never heard of Mr. Russell until he played on the Bangladesh album. I loved the way he did his verse of Beware Of Darkness. Afterwards he made an album called Carney that I have never tired of to this day. Long story shorter I met him at the home of a mutual friend about  years ago. This guy was so fking cool it felt like I was talking to a brother. In the course of that afternoon I actually had the balls to ask him what it was like doing the Bangladesh concert? He said in so many words that being part of that was one of the highlights of his musical career and that working with George was amazing. He basically said that George was so normal devoid of ego you would never guess he had been in The Beatles. The way he talked about it literally gave me a chill. It was then for me that I began to take a second look at George who to this day remains my favorite of the greatest band ever.I am sad at Mr. Russells passing knowing he was behind many of the artists and songs of the s that I love so much. And knowing that he commanded so much respect in the musical community.,beatles,d9z9o1g,3,t5_2qt7l
