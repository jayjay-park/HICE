62622,0,t3_1utf4q,Hes gone its time to move on.  Hopefully we get some nice finemoney coming our way.  Honestly I like Camilo and he was a great goal scorer but he wasnt that great.  Undersized no defensive skill didnt pass and lost the ball when trying to make too many moves way too often.  Im not saying good riddance by any means but he was a liability just as much as he was a goal scorer.,whitecapsfc,celk598,12,t5_2s56y
66676,0,t1_celnndx,The article did bring up the point that you need the veteran spine in place. Also if we did go this way it would not be as extremely youth filled as suggested here but with the cheaper contracts of the younger players HG salaries only a  go against the cap I think we can use it to sign a few more veteran players and keep the others happy. this way could lead to a more well rounded developed team then one just shining bright because of few big signings.,whitecapsfc,cem0ri7,1,t5_2s56y

No paying crazy premium for marquee games e.g. playoffs. The club caps seating capacity relatively low so I almost never lose money when reselling tickets to games I cant go to. I probably only go to  to  of games so this is a big selling point for me. When it comes to renewal time I dont give it a second thought.  discount on team gear. Plus the odd free thing from the club got a scarf per seat last year. Loyalty points program  down the list because points are most likely worthless but you might get lucky and get something out of it.

7638979,0,t3_4jxj16,Im not sure when the Copa camps start but I imagine PerezBolanosWaston will be available for Portland this weekend and possibly Houston the following weekend. After that is two CCL matches probably against Ottawa where Im sure the plan was always to sit a lot of regulars and play a lot of younger guys  I havent been following WFC closely enough to guess wholl get the call for those matches but Im sure well see Hurtado Teibert maybe Adekugbe probably Tornaghi etc. That basically leaves the New England and Philadelphia matches at the end of June as the ones where well be a bit shortstaffed and it seems likely Rivero will be fit at that point so hell surely be the striker. Kah for Waston is a straightforward swap  not as good but good enough. Bolanos is actually the tougher replacement I kind of expect Robbo to move Morales up and start Jacobson beside Laba but the midfield just looks so much more confident and creative with Bolanos up and Morales back.,whitecapsfc,d3aicj0,2,t5_2s56y

8392112,0,t1_d5qib9b,He has a contract to play for MLS and we have his RMLS rights but it is obviously not in our best interests to keep him around if he doesnt want to be hereplay here. So wed t sell him to another team for cash.The Camilo situation was interesting in that MLS has contract options for an additional year at the same salary that can be executed by the team. Camilo and his agent thought he was worth more true and according to their side thought they had to accept the option as well which they have no say in. FIFA doesnt like central ownership of players or options so there wasnt much we could do if he wanted to go and we ended up selling him for cash. Again because it doesnt make sense to have a player who is unhappy which could turn into a bad locker room situation.If any of this is wrong let me know.
