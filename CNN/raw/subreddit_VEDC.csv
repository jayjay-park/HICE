4042853,0,t3_36u74w,My workday on the Jeep was cut short when one of my mechanics discovered a leaky fuel injector.  I took it back to the shop that worked on the fuel system last since they were going to warranty the work.  While they had it I learned I had used the wrong kind of hose for my transmission cooler lines and they would need swapped.  Needless to say a day of packing turned into a day without my Jeep.  It was also raining most of the day which limited time outside and photo opportunities.Once I had it back I was able to test fit some of my containers and make sure things had home.

4922017,0,t3_3h0xc6,I work in the automotive industry in large part doing offroad driving instruction for vehicle manufactures.  In this I have come across a wide variety of OEM and after market lifting solutions. By far the best small jack I have come across is the stock Land Rover Bottle Jack used in the  Range Rover and the  Discovery. It has a U shaped cradle on the top which allows for a much better purchase onto the lifting point than a standard bottle jack. The jacks are high quality made in Italy units and this far I have never had one fail on me. You can find them on eBay fairly cheap but the best option is a upullit type junk yard. Make sure to get the proper handle pieces that come with it.  Hilifts have their uses but can be rather dangerous at the best of times.

It saddens me that such laws are necessary but I understand.I also used to maintain CPR and First Aid certifications through Red Cross I should really update those as well.  Minnesota Statutes  A. GOOD SAMARITAN LAW.gt Subdivision  .  Duty to assist.   A person at the scene of an emergency who knows that another person is exposed to or has suffered grave physical harm shall to the extent that the person can do so without danger or peril to self or others give reasonable assistance to the exposed person. Reasonable assistance may include obtaining or attempting to obtain aid from law enforcement or medical personnel. A person who violates this subdivision is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.  gtSubd. .General immunity from liability.  A person who without compensation or the expectation of compensation renders emergency care advice or assistance at the scene of an emergency or during transit to a location where professional medical care can be rendered is not liable for any civil damages as a result of acts or omissions by that person in rendering the emergency care advice or assistance unless the person acts in a willful and wanton or reckless manner in providing the care advice or assistance. This subdivision does not apply to a person rendering emergency care advice or assistance during the course of regular employment and receiving compensation or expecting to receive compensation for rendering the care advice or assistance.,VEDC,d09si73,2,t5_2x2h6

10150655,0,t1_dbul1wy,TLDR Reading things things at night when you dont want your pupils to react to the light.Go into your bathroom close the door and dont turn on any lights.Your pupils will eventually adjust to the lower light level and allow you to see more detailed outlines of objects.  If you were to turn on the light for five seconds and then turn it off youll essentially loose that ability until your eyes adjust again.But if the light was read or green some pilots prefer that and at a lower power your pupils dont really react.  Meaning you can look at something illuminated by redgreen light and then immediately go back to looking at the darkness and still retain the ability to distinguish shapes.  This is the reason why vehicle interiors use green or red to illuminate the dash and center console when the headlights are turned on.,VEDC,dbumruz,1,t5_2x2h6

10401950,0,t1_dcn1bls,No no its not just for voltage that reads like either a gross misunderstanding or an oversimplification by someone with theory knowledge but no field engineering experience. Yes voltage matters as far as the nonconductivity of a specific insulator and there is always a breakdown voltage of any material thus specifications are in voltage but actual current cannot be discounted. An uninsulated wire at v can still carry enough current to kill. Quality of the insulating material is a necessary and serious concern both in performance and longevity. I was not referring to thickness of the insulation Im talking about the quality and materials used thermoplastic vs thermoset plastic vs rubber. Temperature performance degradation due to heat or cold whether climate or conductor related longevity elasticity wear rates etc all are a concern. A set of cables where the insulation has cracked chipped flaked off or word down exposing bare conductor is a dangerous situation. Also a v car battery absolutely can and will kill and its extremely dangerous to insinuate otherwise. As for the comments about resistance the human bodys resistance and conditions heavily influencing that easily  of the time I use jumper cables its either pouring rain Blizzard conditions or off road and dragging cables through mud and water. Very rarely have I ever had to jump myself or others in the shining daylight in a nice paved parking lot. My personal truck is not a Pavement Princess by any means and Id prefer to be prepared for the worst case situations.EDIT scratch most of that its basically what you said on mobile and couldnt reference back.
