3879071,0,t1_cqxmqoe,You did well. Looks like a bit of fun. How tall are you? Generally people dont have too much problem with the size of it until youre over . Then again you might just need a little practice with the clutch on a new bike! Good find.,ninja250r,cqyg4ra,1,t5_2tnm4

Definitely change the oil right away.  Dont want that circulating through the bike. ,ninja250r,d29i29s,1,t5_2tnm4
