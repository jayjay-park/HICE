2366091,0,t1_cm3l8dk,It isnt specifically that the device was active on Sprint but that a serial number is one reserved to be sold by Sprint. As far as I can tell Ting gets their own stock of phones with serial numbers outside of the range or list that Sprint reserves for itself and this is what they sell on Ting.com. So for example if you buy a N from my store without ever activating it and paying full retail it still would not be BYOSD eligible because it was reserved for sale at a Sprint store. ,ting,cm45p4z,1,t5_2szye

6147523,0,t1_cyoagy6,Youre confusing things. Lots of carriers support using Google Voice for voicemail including Ting. Google only lists big national providers like TMobile Verizon and Sprint though not small guys like Ting. I think thats why the code Google tells you to dial doesnt work. However Ting makes it easy to enable Call Forwarding on No Answer via their website.The Sprint branded Nexus was much more than just Google Voice for Voicemail and is more like what users on Project Fi experience there is no cell number theres only a Google Voice number. You can make calls and send texts using any dialersms app on the phone and they always use your Google Voice number. We dont get that level of integration on Ting. But we can use Google Voice instead of Tings voicemail when people call our ting number.,ting,cyoeqi6,1,t5_2szye

9290249,0,t3_575iqu,I have had Ting for just over  year.  The only dropped call I have ever had was when I had to call ATampT   times to get them to unlock my phone lol.  I do believe this was purposeful on their part to prevent me from terminating my service.  Never once have I or my fiancee had a dropped call in any other circumstance.  We are both very used to being on a WiFi to use Internet due to our previous carriers very generous  gigs to share between  people for  a month what a joke and our bill is now  and has been since we joined.  Customer service is like outstanding.  I think when I called the first time I actually hung up on them because I thought I had the wrong number.  A real person answered it on ring  which is the norm for them I believe.  Also I do believe that each operator has the authority and knowledge to complete any task associated with your service.  There is no switching you to another department.  Any issue you have with them is satisfactorily over in less than  minutes and thats from time you call to time you hang up with a smile. Amazing.  I will even say that this is perhaps the best company I have ever seen in terms of cost and customer service in my life.  I am .,ting,d8tltcr,1,t5_2szye

No warrenty because it was from overseas.  So I was out .I bought a replacement phone from Ting for under . The Galaxy J.  it works fine as a phone.
