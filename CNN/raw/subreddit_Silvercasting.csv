3451537,0,t1_cpkz44e,I really liked your army soldiers. They turned out flawlessly. Such a cool idea.  I tried to delft cast some smaller army men awhile ago but their weaponry was too spindly so they ended up shooting with imaginary rifles.,Silvercasting,cplpa9u,2,t5_353dy

3565212,0,t1_cpyn10g,Its all good.  I had to give up some things but with working metal I can hammer on things I can polish I can drill I can play with Fire! Lol. I have pliers and hammers and I want more...because who doesnt want more tools. Lol. And Im a nerd so Ive studied so much of the science behind working with metal and specifically sterling. Im a woman who has always worked in male dominated fields and I love it. I work with guys who weld drill through inches of hardened steel while still maintaining the integrity of the piece they are working on. And when I talk about my work they are like WOW! And those guys who are required to do both heavy duty work and incredibly intricate and fine work look at my work and say youre at least at a hr skill level. And that feels good.  sorry I started to babble a bit but Im self taught and until I found this sub I had no one else to talk to about this stuff. ,Silvercasting,cpynsph,2,t5_353dy
4070108,0,t3_375wx8,Im in the same boat but Im thinking about making a cheapo vacuum rig big clear plastic bowl  square Masonite or some such hand vacuum pump from China Freight.  I bet I can get close enough.  It aint rocket surgery.,Silvercasting,crk7xhi,3,t5_353dy
4142427,0,t3_3855a7,Any outlet ever should be able to deliver A.Hairdryers are A for example.There is either other load on the same circuit or really shitty wiring.If there is a breaker box in the garage likely especially if its detached it is very simple to add a circuit and an external box with an outlet inside.  Parts cost under  and you can DIY it with some youtubing and common sense.,Silvercasting,crsgcww,1,t5_353dy
4208139,0,t1_crzwxe9,Wouldnt those more or less be the same thing anyway? I mean any increase in emotionalaestheticother evaluation of silver would probably be reflected in at least some way in demand and thus price.,Silvercasting,crzwzjd,3,t5_353dy

9262203,0,t3_5775z5,If its just a thin electro plating it should come off easily.I have dissolved silver from old telescope mirrors with ferric nitrate. Even a dilute solution would work well and give you good control itll take longer. Next step is to ask some mineral folk whether ferric nitrate will eat your rock. Silver is quite reactive so my guess is that the ferric nitrate will dissolve it faster than the iron or the trace metals that are likely to be in your meteorite.Edit nitric acid will also work very quickly. But its not nice to work with. It could also attack your iron. But depending on the concentration and temperature it might be a reasonable choice. ,Silvercasting,d8q1u58,3,t5_353dy

11060569,0,t3_5wh6qm,Coins mate! Sterling silver coins with a hole cut in the centre then hammer over a mandrel then size in a doming block. Its a bit more than that but I see some pretty worm coins in my coin ring making searches and Ive made one where I messed up the outside and made it smooth. ,Silvercasting,delp4ge,1,t5_353dy
