1884879,0,t3_2g6md6,I cant invite you back while youre in another clan.Also in the future dont just use the stock Id like to join your clan message. Personally and I think this is what happened when you were rejected if I see that I reject automatically and then check out the player. Something as simple as galaxy Im back wouldve worked just fine. ,RedditRecon,ckgbjlj,1,t5_31afr

7020526,0,t3_4bsye9,As stated in the previous State of Recon post leadership was on the look out for a clan to merge with. I said we would find a clan that fit both our culture and our desire to war. I am happy and excited to announce that we will be merging with our good friends at Reddit Mist!  It will be a pretty smooth transition and Im sure we will all get along really well. Final rosters will be posted tomorrow and everyone will be moved to their appropriate clans on Monday. Rosters are made based on war activity if you are mostly active in wars you will move up. If you are chosen to stay in Recon you can always move up to Mist if your war activity improves. We still have the match up tomorrow with Reddit Templars and that will be our last war before the move.  Reddit Recon will serve as feeder if there is no room left in Mist and will also be a place to take a break if you will be inactive for a period lasting more than one week.  War schedule will change there will be a clan vote after the move to determine what will fit everyone the best. We will continue to use Warmatch for our claims but claims will now be on a  timer. For example a claim made on prep day will last  hours a claim made at  hours remaining will last  hours a claim made at  hours will last  hours and so on. Like always if a claim expires you are free to claim that base if it has not been attacked but ask the person that had the previous claim if they are attacking soon.  As for leadership Siscim will keep leader in Mist with ReconMist leadership being CoLeaders. I will keep leadership in Recon on my alt and alts of leadership will be in charge at Recon with the possibility of promotion of members in Recon if needed.  If you have any questions please ask here or ask any of the elders on GM or clan chat.,RedditRecon,d1c4kyf,4,t5_31afr
