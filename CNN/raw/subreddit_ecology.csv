3441461,0,t3_2zaiya,Honestly you can do this on graph paper. Just make a rough scale map on a piece of graph paper that ties in to a known point like a road intersection or a fence. You are an undergrad it doesnt have to be perfect. Give the lines a number value and use excel to generate a random x and y value.From a statistical standpoint it is much more important that your x grids are accurately bounded on the ground than the plots themselves are exactly where they are supposed to be.If you are familiar with Arc thats a much easier option just make the fishnet generate the random points and place them in a GPS unit.

4878389,0,t3_3hmyxz,I was working with my states Department of Fish amp Wildlife for the conservation of several species of shorebird. This involved roping off  x  foot sections of beach for individual Piping Plover to next in. Once we see a few scrapes or a definite nest they get the rope treatment. The beaches where I was are very long and wide and there are paths all over to get from the road to the beach so roping off a few sections doesnt really hinder most people.Most people are apparently not this beast I had to deal with. She cam stomping down the one path in a quarter mile that I had to block because we had a Plover nest. She gets to the rope and thats when this ridiculous conversation happensLady Are you kidding me?! Another rope? she starts attempting to go under itMe Maam you cant do that. You have to go around there is an endangered bird nesting here.Lady She stops and stands beyond the rope These are not endangered! There are plenty of this bird she dismissively waves her hand in the direction of our PiPl. I went to the meeting!Me This is a Piping Plover and it is state and federally protected. What meeting? If there was a meeting I would have been there.Lady She starts actually stamping her feet like a child I hate these damn birds! I wish they would all go extinct already so I could have my beach back! Theyre not endangered and if they were who cares?!Me Okay look. First I need you to move away from the roping  and me. Youre disturbing the bird who is in fact endangered. And are you fucking kidding me right now? You want an entire species to go extinct so you can go to the beach? There is room all over for you! This isnt even your home youre some lousy tourist who invades for the summer and ruins our beaches! Get out of my face and away from this nest before I call the police.Lady You cant speak to me that way! I want to talk to your manager! You cant talk to me like this!Me Here is the Project Managers number. Knock yourself out. Again I am going to call the police if you dont walk away right now.She left back up to the road she came from yelling at me the entire way. I went about my business counting nests and adults roping off other nests and speaking to interested birders who would show up every day asking when the chicks would be born. About an hour later I get a phone call from the Project Manager. He asks me what happened I told him everything and apologized for losing my cool. Its incredibly upsetting to have someone tell you they hope an entire species goes extinct when youre working to save them. It turns out he thought it was really funny and in the past week had to handle other irate tourists himself so he sympathized. All was well. Half an hour goes by and I get a phone call from a number I dont recognize. It was the mayor of the town.. Apparently this woman called my PM and the mayor to complain about me. The mayor was really sweet and she apologized to me for that woman and said very officially The town is of course in compliance with the state and federal laws protecting the birds on the beach. Please if that happens again call the police and they will be right over. Ive already spoken to our police chief about how important this is. We talked for a few minutes I thanked her and that was that.Why was the mayor so eager to let us know the town is in compliance and basically doesnt want any trouble? The season before one of their beach rakes ran over a Piping plover chick and the town was sued by the state and lost. It was a big to do and I think they didnt want any more problems.,ecology,cu9giuf,3,t5_2qoii

5371725,0,t1_cvy6h1b,This looks very undergrad. Undergrad research is important but where is the money going qiagen kits sequence costs vehicles etc? Also why sequence CO for ID? Seems to me that keying out species would be a more useful skill to develop. If the species is already in the database its kind of a wasted effort. Unless theyre trying to parse out new speciessubspecies. Additionally traditional grant writing would look much better on a CV than crowdfunding and Im sure there are easily attainable internal university grants available to them. I genuinely dont mean offense but the crowdfunding description makes this seem very poorly thought out. My undergrad research PI wouldnt have let something this poorly put together be put up. I suspect their PI isnt super involved which makes me even less likely to donate money. OP Put up a basic budget. Describe why you are doing this. List concrete objectives and deliverables. You dont need to do a bunch of hand waving about how important biodiversity is. The majority of ecologists still believe in basic nonmanagement oriented science. Just state that as I suspect this money will be used to give undergrads some experience doing lab and field work. ,ecology,cvyaqxx,3,t5_2qoii

6083755,0,t3_3yu19w,Great paper that addresses one of the more important philosophical questions being discussed in the restoration community these days. I thought this was a more fair perspective than many other papers I have read on novel ecosystems which as the authors alluded can be pretty extreme in support or against the concept. Ill agree the implications can be large. I dont have firm answers but I think some of the more important questions surround the topic are how novel is novelty? Is it really increasing? The baselines we compare to were novel sometime. There isnt much argument that the world is complex in the mathematical sense  synonymous with dynamic stochastic or chaotic. The definition of a chaotic system is one that produces novelty. We expect novelty. It isnt bad. The historic earth was not perfect or unchanging.  is novelty really that unpredictable? Sure it is hard to know what novel conditions will emerge but it is someone less hard to predict wherewhenhow much novelty will be produced. Lots of apparently unpredictable systems are really just oscillating dynamically in ways that are described well by a rather consistent fractal dimension. we are learning to predict novel events like earthquakes and floods even when the occur outside their ranges of known historical variability based on these patterns. We could develop better predictive models for the appearance of novelty in ecosystems as well but chaotic math is still pretty much in its infancy. It is only barely trickling out of math departments and being picked up for attempted practical applications by a few ecologists economists physicists and other professionals who work in dynamic systems. ,ecology,cyh27qt,5,t5_2qoii

10804848,0,t3_5ujd32,Summary for the busygt A new WCS study in India shows that three carnivores  tigers leopards and dholes Asian wild dog  seemingly in direct competition with one other are living side by side with surprisingly little conflict. Usually big cats and wild canids live in different locations to avoid each other.gtYet in four relatively small reserves in Indias wildliferich Western Ghats region WCS researchers have found that they are coexisting despite competing for much of the same prey including sambar deer chital and pigs.Journal article link.AbstractgtSpecies within a guild vary their use of time space and resources thereby enabling sympatry. As intraguild competition intensifies such behavioural adaptations may become prominent. We assessed mechanisms of facilitating sympatry among dhole Cuon alpinus leopard Panthera pardus and tiger Panthera tigris in tropical forests of India using cameratrap surveys. We examined populationlevel temporal spatial and spatiotemporal segregation among them across four reserves representing a gradient of carnivore and prey densities. Temporal and spatial overlaps were higher at lower prey densities. Combined spatiotemporal overlap was minimal possibly due to chance. We found finescale avoidance behaviours at one highdensity reserve. Our results suggest that i patterns of spatial temporal and spatiotemporal segregation in sympatric carnivores do not necessarily mirror each other ii carnivores are likely to adopt temporal spatial and spatiotemporal segregation as alternative mechanisms to facilitate sympatry and iii carnivores show adaptability across a gradient of resource availability a driver of interspecies competition. We discuss behavioural mechanisms that permit carnivores to cooccupy rather than dominate functional niches and adaptations to varying intensities of competition that are likely to shape structure and dynamics of carnivore guilds.,ecology,ddufzsq,6,t5_2qoii
