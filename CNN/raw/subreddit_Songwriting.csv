692977,0,t3_222bqs,I liked it.  Had an ambient feel.Which is to say too that in future workdepending on what youre try to createif you wanted a more rockaltpop feel look for a bridge or a creshendo s of the way through that really steps out of the song. And for your vocals they were great for this song.  It was a good choice.  At the same time dont feel bad about just putting them out there wo muddying them with reverb and echo in the future.  Its a wall put up between you and the listener and while it works great here and album of that wall would most likely not be the best choice.Having said all that if an ambient style is what youre after then you hit it!  This was great.As far as the loop pedal I liked what you did.  Some syncopation a nice minimalistic feel.  Really good stuff.  In the future maybe try incorporating more smaller layers.  Which isnt to say your loop work wasnt good it was.I hope my feedback wasnt too harsh because you did some really good work here and have a lot of different directions you could explore with some obvious talent.,Songwriting,cgj1kt0,1,t5_2qjzn

1384861,0,t3_29y3vf,How do those riffs work together? A song is as good as the sum of its parts. The way a versechorus complement each other each other drives the song as a whole. Does the verse setup the chorus? Chorus melodies are short and concise often no more than  bars to be easy to remember. Verses can be more wandering and not so concise.None of these points are hard rules but suggestions. You want people to remember the chorus and keeping it simple helps with that. Also feel free to use more harmonies in the chorus make it sound big.,Songwriting,cipviiv,1,t5_2qjzn
1658811,0,t1_cjo23kl,Have never heard the concept of the bridge as the counterpoint idea.  Is it in conflict with the song as it has been created up to that point or is it a counterpoint to the larger concepts and beliefs which back up the perspective of the song?  ,Songwriting,cjo9874,1,t5_2qjzn

2956609,0,t1_co46ia9,ampampamp Secondary dominant sfw gtSecondary dominant also applied dominant artificial dominant or borrowed dominant is an analytical label for a specific harmonic device prevalent in the tonal idiom of Western music beginning in the common practice period It refers to a dominant seventh chord set to resolve to a degree that is not the tonic with VV the dominant of the dominant being the most frequently encountered.  The chord to which a secondary dominant progresses can be thought of as a briefly tonicized chord or pitch tonicizations longer than a phrase are modulations The secondarydominant terminology is still usually applied even if the chord resolution is nonfunctional for example if Vii is not followed by ii. gtgtImage i  The circle of fifths the dominant or secondary dominant will always be found immediately clockwise of the tonic or tonicized chord and functionally resolves counterclockwise to that chord. For example in C V is G and resolves to C VV is D and resolves to G.Interesting Secondary leadingtone chord | Secondary supertonic chord | Tonicization | Chromatic mediant Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcojw oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecojw.

But then my mind wanders and I wax poetic or philosophical when Im bored sometimes.Also keep a notebook or something next to your bed. You may be surprised what you wake up with in your head from a dream or what words may come to mind when youre relaxing for the night or when you first wake up. A lot of inspiration can be a very nonsequitur thing and youll start getting to know when your creativity is at its peak.

6354548,0,t3_40kx3x,. He said that songwriting could be summed up by John Lennons advice to him Say what you mean make it rhyme put a back beat to it.. He liked to impose artificial constraints like using Cut Up technique and forcing himself to use the results or restricting himself to  arbitrary chords.. When composing on piano he liked to keep a chord in the right hand while moving the bass around in the left to create new resulting harmonies he does this a lot in Life on Mars?.. In the late searly s he would compose way more songs than he needed for a given album as in over  in one case.  I think this is equivalent to just writing every day.,Songwriting,czbxxch,1,t5_2qjzn

6385689,0,t1_czf4v80,That quote has helped me so much with writing.Nobody tells this to people who are beginners I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff its just not that good. Its trying to be good it has potential but its not. But your taste the thing that got you into the game is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase they quit. Most people I know who do interesting creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesnt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone Ive ever met. Its gonna take awhile. Its normal to take awhile.

If youre having trouble finding something to write about go out and experience life more. A lot of songwriters have lived a life of pain and loss and they use music as a way to express that. Im not suggesting you go out and look for suffering but by just living life youll probably find it.If you have things you want to write about but cant phrase them or make them into a good song all you need to do is practice.,Songwriting,d82d95w,2,t5_2qjzn

9727947,0,t3_5efghj,ubuttsoup has provided some great advice.    For me Ill often give myself a time period to start and finish something. Starting a song is just as important as finishing it.    In that  minutes Ill do minimal editing. Therell be plenty of time to edit another time read Day. Like a child  go crazy and enjoy the process. Songwriting is process based not end result based.      Now  ?! wants a good product. Everyone wants to write a Yesterday a Wondeteall a Smells like teen spirit but only a few people want to write the  ok songs beforehand. Nobody wants to write magical mystery tour.     Finally someones it helps to give yourself limitations. Try this.....     gtsit down for  minutes and work on a song called heart break city. It needs to be at a tempo of  bpm.  Dont worry about if it sounds bad or cliche. Youre crafting the skill. If its good share it. If its bad give it to the bin. You HAVE to finish it though. ,Songwriting,dac6kw4,2,t5_2qjzn

10190023,0,t1_dbyrtdc,I agree. Which is why I hate GarageBand on my phone because its so hard to really edit once youve got most of a song recorded. So often Ill find some great line or idea when Im almost finished with a  min song and its so tedious to try and cut and rerecord or rewrite at a certain point etc. Or maybe its not and I just suck. But Ive found myself falling in that trap before and only writing one part at a time. Writing an intro then trying to find a good verse. Recording that then trying to find a good chorus. Yadda yadda.

Be confident in your melody and stick to it. Even though it is a slow song with not a lot of melodic changes you still need to stick to the melody you are going for. I could pick it out at some times but then it got lost and switched more to spoken word. Cool song idea keep working on the recording Im sure even with your setup you can get a better quality recording if you work on blocking out background noise.,Songwriting,dgsytl1,2,t5_2qjzn
