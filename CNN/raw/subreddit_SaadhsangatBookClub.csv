8392928,0,t1_d5j4qcx,I really like this post. Great explanation. The comment regarding one unified consciousness got me thinking...Wouldnt it be very helpful to control our ego if we truly believed that we are all one unity? And I mean actually  believing this and not forgetting. Everybody as one joth. If we viewed the world in this way all jealousy and greed would be eliminated. For example someone has a great skillset and we become jealous of that person. Our ego kicks in. However we will not feel this jealousy as we understand that we are also a part of that joth. The same joth that resides in that person also resides in us. God residing within everyone. We would just think Vah! The creator is amazing. whenever we witness something awesome in this world. There will be no more houmai because it wouldnt be about me or you anymore. It would be about everyone and everything. It would simply be about God and we are all just a part of it. When we happen to do something amazing instead of feeling pride we will be thankful that God has allowedchosen us to be a part of his doing and we will remember that it is not really us but Him.I think this is a good strategy to control ego. This idea of one unified joth amongst everyone is helping me see things differently as I go through my day so I decided to share. ,SaadhsangatBookClub,d5qnvwp,1,t5_3f6jj
