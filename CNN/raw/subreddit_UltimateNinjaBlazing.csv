8323126,0,t1_d5hwbqz,i have to agree with the other guy in if im the host im going to pick and choose whos the randoms on my team. losing stam is not fun because people dont understand elemental weaknesses or positioning. I also think most of us would assume  should know how to act seeing as they had to grind out all those  ramen already to get to  to begin with. if i join some randos group i really dont care who he picks other than time i dont lose anything and i have all the drops to gain.,UltimateNinjaBlazing,d5hy2nw,1,t5_3fhey
