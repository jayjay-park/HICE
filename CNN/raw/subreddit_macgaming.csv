A lot of those have Mac ports on Steam as well.You might also try setting up emulators like OpenEmu on OSX v. just came out but the UI is still kind of buggy and PCSX either OSX or Windows side OSX version works very well.Also if youre into roguelikes also check out Tales of MajEyal and Dungeons of Dredmor.

Bootcamp is just a fancy thing to partition your drive and then to help install windows to be able to dual boot.

There is a commercial product from codeweavers. Here is the info about fifa.Knowing d games youll probably be able to run it but it might be at a lower resolution. I normally dont commend on stuff like this but there havent been very useful comments so I figured Id take a stab at it. BTW GB refers to RAM which is what the programs run in and your hard drive would be much bigger. See how much hard drive space you have by clicking about this mac in the apple menu at the top left of your screen. Then choose the storage tab.

4422068,0,t3_3bojbe,Alternatives are either Winebased or require a Windows install. Did you check out appdb.winehq.org Usually has compatibility ratings and sometimes has installation notes. portingteam.com may have a wrapper for the game already made and  if so   could have directions on dealing with this bug.The game is DirectX . and could possibly run on a modern phone requires MB RAM MB gfx .GHz processor so theres no real reason other than incompatibility that it shouldnt run.Have you tried playing with the settings in the wrapper? Right clickgtShow Package Contentsgtrun Wineskin.app go to Screen Options and change Use Mac Driver instead of X and then try to run it. If that still runs the same you could try some settings in Wineskingt AdvancedgtConfig Utility winecfg under the Graphics tab probably least likely to help or others in Screen Options most likely to help. Changing the Wine engine used can also effect compatibility  what one are you using? It displays it in the WineskingtAdvanced window near the bottom or in WineskingtAdvancedgtToolsgtChange Engine used. Also settings that work for one version of the Wine engine may not work with others.Because of the insanely low requirements it could be worth trying in a virtual machine  they take a lot of RAM and CPU power compared to Wine products but usually support the necessary functionality for everything depending on which virtualization option you choose  VirtualBox VMware Fusion Parallels. But if you have a Windows install and making your Mac dualboot doesnt sound bad BootCamp  a Windows install would likely give the best results.,macgaming,cso3osf,2,t5_2rk3e

5341422,0,t3_3o4f1w,I had this issue as well until I realized theres really an obvious explanation that you may be overlooking. Your laptop screen is probably running at x in scaled mode if your external display is larger like for example a  thunderbolt display that runs at x your performance will be seriously reduced. The graphics card in your laptop is meant to be sufficient at x. So you can either run the games at a lower resolution or play them only on your laptop screen. Gaming at p requires a more powerful card. Now if youre not using a TBD but instead a p TV then this is obviously not what youre dealing with and it may be a hardware issue. I would suggest downloading gfxCardStatus for osx and using it to force the system to use the discrete card instead of swapping to the intel one assuming your mbpr has a discreet gpu.Hope you get it figured out.,macgaming,cvufbto,1,t5_2rk3e

5638923,0,t1_cwvz268,First you have to download Wineskin Winery and use that to download at least one Wine engine and create a wrapper with it. This part should be pretty well documented by Wineskin at least on their webpage  The highestnumber WSWine engines are the latest .. is the newest Wine easily available for Wineskin and CX.. is the latest CrossOver engine from the CrossOver app easily available for Wineskin. CrossOver sometimes has some bugfixes not included in Wine but sometimes it runs worse.If youre playing via Steam youll need that installed first and its easiest to install if you disable dwrite like the first comment to this users question  and install the Tahoma font via Winetricks Show Package Contents of the wrappergtOpen Wineskin.appgtgo to AdvancedgtToolsgtWinetricksgtFonts and check the Tahoma font and then press Run to install it. If you try to install Steam through Winetricks and it fails always does for me you can use your Mac to download the Windows version of the Steam installer from  you have to click the text under Install Steam button where it says they also have Windows and Linux versions and install it into the wrapper via Show Package ContentsgtWineskin.appgtInstall Software. You dont need to close the wrapper between each of these changes but when you install Steam it will try to run and if you havent installed the Tahoma font and disabled dwrite your best bet is closing it Steam as you wont be able to see most text.If you installed Steam andor GW using WineBottler you may be able to find the installation folder there Show Package ContentsgtResources folder somewheregtdrivec or cdrive folder somewheregtProgram FilesgtSteamgtsteamappsgtcommon move the Guild Wars folder out of there or into the Wineskin wrapper into drivecgtProgram FilesgtSteamgtsteamappsgtcommon. Also grab the appmanifest.acf for Game of the Year edition different versions may be different  let us know what version you have if you need help finding its Steam app id number from the steamapps folder as its needed for Steam to notice the installation and move it into the new wrapper in the same location in the steamapps folder.After that you can try running it close the Wineskin.app from within the wrapper first but you may need to tweak some settings using Wineskin.app within the wrapper before it will actually run. Usually going to AdvancedgtToolsgtSet Screen Options and changing Use Mac driver instead of X helps if default Wineskin settings dont work theres A LOT of other stuff that can be tweaked also. You have to completely exit and reopen the wrapper to get changes to Wineskin settings to take effect AFAIK.,macgaming,cww29ac,1,t5_2rk3e

The mac version of these drivers contains additional instructions to the hardware to keep the temperature below a damaging range if you bypass this not only will you introduce a slightly weird stutter as to the gameplay when fully taxed youll also be running slightly over temp which can cause bad things to happen.Just make sure you keep getting the latest bootcamp drivers from the bootcamp assistant instead I know its a pain in the ass but its much safer and you will still gain a few fps each update.,macgaming,cyi73xf,4,t5_2rk3e

9368803,0,t3_58vfta,I posted about this recently and people seemed to think I was crazy... It sounds like a bunch of us are crazy. Get a CT Scan on your brain to make sure everything is normal then your MacBook temps should be back to normal.    But seriously its normal because the MacBook Pro is so thin it really ought to have a T or U series i in it but it has HQ and arguably it isnt properly equipped to dissipate sustained  load from the CPUiGPU or MX GPU if that applies to you. Back when I played Fallout  on my  rMBP wMX the CPU would reach C and the GPU would reach c fans were at  MacBook was wellventilated in a room temp of about C F GPU was usually at  load but if I stopped or it was loading a different area of Boston it was closer to  load and then the CPU was prettymuch floored kind of hard to tell since  threads are shared with the physical threadscores but it was pretty close to . Fallout  is one of those games that taxes both the CPU shadows reflections etc. and GPU textures etc. though the MX was definitely the bottleneck.         What a lot of people dont realize is that fans cool the heatsink not the chip CPUGPU and in MacBooks the heatsinks are so small so ever fucking small that the fan has to go nuts moving that heat out since the heatsink can barely hold any of that heat. Its like an assembly line at Point A CPU there are  workers doing their thing and then passing it along to Point B the heatsink which at that size has like  workers and finally it reaches Point C Fan which has about  workers as well. So Point As workers are churning out the product like crazy and Points B and C cant keep up so Point A has to scale back a little Thermal Throttling so  of its workers go to the bowling alley.    Anywho tldr It is normal the computer will shut down automatically to prevent heat damage although many will argue that over long periods of time years the wearandtear will catch up to the MacBook and kill itcause GPU failure like weve seen with the  MacBooks.

10497977,0,t1_dct161c,This. As the other guy said doesnt heat up my Mac add to that a hell of a soundtrack and a gameplay that doesnt get stale. I get bored of games very easily and rarely finish them. And FTL is my most played game on Steam and I always find myself coming back to it. Its very hard but gets you addicted.,macgaming,dcy21an,1,t5_2rk3e

10838241,0,t1_ddxosjr,gt Also uWadeW said that we cant change anything in the new MBP because they soldered the components on the motherboardThat is correct. Since your initial question was about gaming I would like to add that it is possible to run games from an external HDD or SSD. I have an external TB USB . HDD and while it is not super fast it is fast enough to run games from it with no issues. This allows me to save the amount of storage I commit to the Boot Camp partition.  ,macgaming,ddxvyxs,2,t5_2rk3e
