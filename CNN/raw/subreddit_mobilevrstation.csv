11118441,0,t1_derbyrn,We may be talking about the same thing but I am talking about a button press on a BT controller to bring up the main in VR menu bar using a thumb stick to move the cursor around instead of using head tracking to move the menu bar while the cursor stays centered a button press on the BT to select the menu function the cursor is over then a different button on the BT to hide the menu eye mode.   This is kind of the intuitive way you use a mouse and mouse button on a standard windowsmac OS.  In a laptop without a mouse you do the same thing with a track pad and track pad button but in VR I think it would be better to use a thumb stick preferably digital.  I understand using head tracking as the default UI since it will work if no other controller is present but using head tracking to select a menu item is distracting to the VR setting.So basically three mapped functions.  One button to cycle through bringing up and hiding the menu.  One button to select the menu function the cursor is over and a thumb stick or dpad to move the cursor.  I know making this work is not as easy as just listing it.having said all that having just a BT button that could replace the cardboard buttonscreen press would be great.  There are many inexpensive headsets that dont have that button and I would like to replace that function with a BT button.Looking at your previous response again I think I am saying something slightly different.  Keep the view with head tracking but move the cursor relative to the menu bar with a thumb stick.  Lock the relative position of the cursor to the menu and let it move across the screen as the view moves.  Then the thumb stick changes the relative position of the cursor to the menu bar to move over its options. Kind of like both the menu and cursor have a fixed position in the VR space but you can move the cursor with the thumb stick.,mobilevrstation,des9lt6,1,t5_3j7l9
