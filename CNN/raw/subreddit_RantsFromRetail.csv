3491205,0,t3_308yoh,Yeah I get irritated. In larger places its fine. But in smaller stores it can get ridiculous. For example RetailMeNot. I personally dont understand RMN but I know that our coupons are specifically for customers who sign up to receive them. Ive been told that some companies pay for RMN to have their couponswhether thats true I dont know.People get mad when I tell them we cant take their coupons because theyre for the people who sign up. Im sorry did you know what we have to have a subscription compliance? No you didnt. You only think about your coupon.
