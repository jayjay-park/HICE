And then they are allowed to use the loan function on Moniques computer.Id probably say it with a J sound but I think the hard G suits him.You can use the SetQuartertileplacement cheat with the desk and chair and it should still work so you have more allowance to be a bit fiddly and more precise while still getting the chair to push in on the grid.Ah youre giving me pangs Jessa! I miss my gb of clutter and my omsps Livesimming yay! D I already have a few sims floating around in bodyshop that I want to see you play with haha.
