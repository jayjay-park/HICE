159252,0,t3_1vulo9,The Yankees want a B.  Why? you ask?  Well Im not sure if you heard but our starting B ran into a spot of trouble with an antiaging clinic the MLB Fredric Horowitz the MLBPA federal court just about everyone.  So... the Yankees are interested in anyone who can play the hot corner.  Or even someone who can stand near third base and pretend to play the hot corner.  Or a Wade Boggs cardboard cutout.  Why Boggs?  He was the best Yankees B I could think of.  Sorry BostonTampa Bay fans.  Sorry Craig Nettles actually a Nettles cutout would work too.  Or even Aaron Boone.  Or really anyone else since its a fucking cardboard cutout.So yeah Im not shopping anyone in particular but most playersPROSPECTS are available depending on your teams needs.  So if you have anything listed above talk to me.Edit  All misspelled borderline HOF third basemens names were obviously  intentional and meant as hilarious commentary on todays pressing social issues.Edit Pat Venditte the only switch pitcher in pro baseball that I know of please dont sue me is still available. You know you want him. ,BaseballOffseason2014,cewkli7,6,t5_2yqrl
