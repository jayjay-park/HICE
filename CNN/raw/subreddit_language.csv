573900,0,t3_1xxcdn,Hi there as the others have mentioned it is good for your baby to be exposed to a different language and acquire the sounds. Also it has been proved that bilingual children tend to have a higher IQ among other benefits. This is a picture I found not long ago and very interesting about the benefits of being bilingual it explains how our brain works when knowing another language ,language,cg5i9ni,1,t5_2qlfj

668997,0,t3_21taal,Humans are creatures of habit. If you want to keep both languages at a good level you have to invest into both languages and try to use both regularly. I think its just natural that you lose capabilities in a language even your mother tongue when you stop using it on a daily basis. Some people might even lose almost all of their mother tongue if they dont use them at all but that would take years and no communication in your mother tongue whatsoever. And when you lose skills in your native tongue and improve your second language then I think its normal that it might feel forced and uneasy to use your mother tongue.For me I dont mix up English and my first language the way you described without noticing  but often I would catch myself midsentence searching for words. For example last week I went to visit my parents back in Germany after having spent several months using English almost exclusively and while speaking in my mother tongue I sometimes want to say a word of which only the English word comes to my mind in that moment. Its a bit annoying and you feel retarded because sometimes those are the most simple words youve used all your life. But that goes away at least for me after having to use German for several days.A good friend of mine has the same with DutchGerman she is more like you and incorporates Dutch words into German when she talks to me she normally talks Dutch  of the time nowadays but then again Dutch and German are very similar which might strengthen this effect.So youre definitely not alone I just guess it works differently for every person and heavily depends on how much you use your second language compared to your first language. If its bothering you maybe just read booksarticles or listen to radio or watch TV in your mother tongue to keep it fresh EDIT May I ask what your native language is? Id be interested in knowing if this phenomenon is maybe moreless likely when your first and second language are not at all related e.g. English and Asian or African languages,language,cggbbge,2,t5_2qlfj

2270443,0,t3_2l5lvi,Im think its ultimately a biological system. But only that its an evolved form of animal calls I dont think there is an inbuilt grammar or anything. I believe that humans are really good at recognising patterns and applying logic to those patterns and this is all I think language is. Add on to that the fact that language is not a complex idea and I come to the conclusion that humans are just clever bastards.,language,clschcr,2,t5_2qlfj

3535981,0,t1_cpvbpa1,ampampamp Medieval runes sfw gtgtThe medieval runes or the futhork was a Scandinavian  letter runic alphabet that evolved from the Younger Futhark after the introduction of dotted runes at the end of the Viking Age and it was fully formed in the early th century. Due to the expansion each rune corresponded to only one phoneme whereas the runes in the preceding Younger Futhark could correspond to several. gtThe medieval runes were in use throughout Scandinavia during the Middle Ages and provided the basis for the appearance of runology in the th century.gtInteresting Younger Futhark | Runic calendar | Runes | Dalecarlian runes Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcpvbpcq oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecpvbpcq.

4088213,0,t3_37eack,I used Pimsleur to start learning Japanese before I went to Japan for  months. Did the whole  levels.It was really useful and relaxing way to learn survival phrases. I could order food in restaurants buy things ask for information etc.Obviously its only a start and you need to do a lot of other stuff eventually if you want to get good but I found it a great way to get a foothold because of the lack of effort required.I ended up becoming fluent and fairly literate but that has little to do with Pimsleur in the long run.Have had similarly good results for basic Thai before travelling to Thailand ordering in restaurants using taxis etc.,language,crma51c,2,t5_2qlfj

6274379,0,t3_40muhn,I know from experience that it is possible to be technically a native speaker  you acquired the language by exposure in the early years of your life and yet to be well below CEFR C in terms your ability to actually use the language even in the most complex situations as the C level is defined. Its rare but it happens such as when the language is one you spoke at home when you were little but didnt speak it in school and havent used it since. This is called incomplete acquisition in sociolinguistic circles.In other words your language skills and your status as native speaker are separate categories. One does not necessarily imply the other. I see nothing wrong or dishonest with using the CEFR scale to describe language skills in your mother tongue. The only possible problem is that the CEFR scale was designed with learners in mind and probably doesnt go as high as native speakers are able to go.,language,cz2tr07,2,t5_2qlfj

I like the idea of a blog hopefully I can be a part of this. Maybe can you let me know specifically what youre looking for people to do? Im pretty decent at writing if that helps.,language,d0ewwaz,1,t5_2qlfj
6920720,0,t1_d0yzi8w,Katakana is usually reserved for special purposes such as writing foreign words like pool puuru or onomatopoeia like ribbit kero kero. Many animals giraffe VS or fruits VS etc. are also used. While there was a time when katakana was used for the grammatical portions of sentences today it looks extremely awkward. Im not a native speaker though so I cant necessarily say for sure. ,language,d10scr0,1,t5_2qlfj
