57055,0,t1_cekhk3s,Here are some technical differences   Linked clones consume disk space in a more efficient manner than full clones similar to snapshots. They are essentially a linked snapshot of the parent disk  a delta disk registered as a new VM. Snapshots are simply delta disks of the same VMs disk.  Linked clones allow hardware customizations per linked clone such as a unique uuid for VM disk so linked clones can power on at the same time  Linked clones are managed as separate VMs vs a single VM with multiple snapshots. Clone them to a separate disk folder whatever.  Properly configured Linked clones will perform better than snapshots and especially nested snapshots. It has to do with how the VMs filesystem is read through the various VMDKs on your host filesystem VMFS or NTFS as it reaches the final snapshot to get the desired block of data at the required state.Using the image of snapshots you provided consider Base as your parent VM and    etc.. as linked clones of Base.I would then full clone Base for a new Parent Base with Office  and linked clones  Office  Office  Office etc... just dont do linked clones of linked clones as they are bad for disk performance.,vmware,cekxch7,2,t5_2qnan

2180472,0,t1_clgmj0w,Alright so generally when a ThinApp crashes on top of an installed application Ive always had a harder time for what its worth. Here are some more things we can try. Some may not matter just pasting from our internal Tips amp Tricks. Some of this may not make a difference. On the same machine that you capturedinstalled the software on start a capture then just make a blank package for lack of a better word. Get all the way to where you enable Explorer.exe as an entry point. Build that then open your Explorer.exe entry point. Within that shell browse to the directory where the software is installed and launch it. Generally if this works then your chances of getting this app to work as a ThinApp are somewhat high. The apps weve had the hardest time with failed this test.  Under BuildOptions inside of your package.ini paste this     Start of Custom Parameters      NetRelaunch    ProcessExternalNameBehaviorOriginal     End of Custom Parameters   Run a LogMon to capture a trace of the application. Generally this is found on the machine where your capture software is installed in the same directory as Setup Capture.exe. Run logmonitor.exe then launch the app. When it crashes close out the app then use the Generate text trace report to output a log file of what was going on. Just a warning Ive seen some log files that are  GB in size so this file could be huge. Though from the sound of it since the app is crashing pretty soon it shouldnt be that big. Upload it somewhere and Ill take a look as time permits.Is this being captured on a bit OS or bit? I only ask because the package.ini says your capture machines name was WINDOWS. If it is bit try capturing on a bit machine instead. Also you can try uncommenting this line line  in your package.ini file by removing the semicolon.    Wow,vmware,clgzohj,2,t5_2qnan

2225388,0,t1_cllluzv,Hi  I would like to point out that in the context of using NFS with VMware and running VMware on Exchange  it is not the situation discussed in the article  which is implementing a NAS unit and attaching from the Exchange server using NFS protocol.When we are discussing  VMware NFS protocol implementations typically we are deploying  SAN  systems using NFS protocol  not NAS systems.And we are not attaching filebased volumes to Exchange and instead we are attaching  Blockbased Virtual Disks to Exchange.The article only mentions that NAS environments are not supported but when we are using NFS exclusively to serve VMDKs from an Enterprise array we have a SAN environment not a NAS environment.Also  you do not need specifically supported hardware or virtual hardware for support for Exchange   as noted  unless you are choosing to implement clustering features such as DAG   any  hardware that Windows supports is supported for Exchange.,vmware,clmp880,1,t5_2qnan

If you use volume shadow copy service VSS to quiesce the virtual machine replication traffic cannot be     spread out in small sets of bundles throughout the RPO period. Instead vSphere Replication transfers all the     changed blocks as one set when the virtual machine is idle. Without VSS vSphere Replication can transfer     smaller bundles of changed blocks on an ongoing basis as the blocks change spreading the traffic     throughout the RPO period. ,vmware,cmil8r8,1,t5_2qnan

2571354,0,t1_cmu3wmk,Ive never used App Volumes but Ive been eagerly awaiting its release since were a VMware shop at my university. From what Ive read so far the major drawback is that because it attaches well a volume to the virtual desktop that youre limited to max  volumes. So you cant just package all your apps in their own volumes you have to group them together. The problem is that you cant group your licensed apps that have keys together with other apps without giving that licensed app out for free too. So if you have two many licensed apps and users that need to have many licensed apps then you need to do this outside of AppVolumes like with ThinApp. And if some of those licensed apps cant properly be ThinApped like those apps with kernel mode drivers installed printers or Office plugins well then youre still hooped. That being said I think theyre sticking ThinApp deployment into AppVolumes some how Im just not sure how theyre doing that yet. Its a significant improvement although not a replacement for Thinapps.In all from what Ive seen so far it will improve user experience with application performance compared to using thinapps replacing thinapps in some cases and working alongside in others. It should also reduce the number of pools in larger diverse organizations greatly.,vmware,cmu7q8h,1,t5_2qnan

3188273,0,t3_2wnezu,None. ESXi is designed to not constantly write to USBFlash so that it doesnt destroy the media in writes.Local media will not be used for crashdumps and Logs.On an unconfigured USB setup like your current one Logs will be written to RAMdisk and crashdumps are discarded.This means when you restart ESXi your logs are clear nothing from before the restart will survive. And when you Purple screen the crashdump zdump or core file will not be retained so if you cant diagnose the crash from the contents of the screen then you have no more information with which to investigate.Provided you dont have many problems and you dont experience constant or regular purple diagnostic screens youre going to be just fine in the current configuration.Your host MAY have a constant warning that the logs are being sent to a temporary location or something similar this is safe to ignore provided you dont want to keep your logs.Alternatively set up a logging server or NFS datastore to retain the logscrashdumps.  There are KB articles from VMware on how to point the logs to another location and how to dump to file on NFS alternatively theres a crashdump server you can use from VMware part of a vCenter install.EDIT it doesnt HAVE to be NFS it can be iSCSIFC VMFS I only suggest NFS because it can be opened by any linux system and most file servers that support NFS also support CIFS windows sharing giving you much more robust access to the data.,vmware,cosgqfj,13,t5_2qnan

4639398,0,t3_3ehuuf,What determines your storage is your high availability capability of your applications.  Yes VMware wants you to use shared storage for vMotion HA DRS etc and also use FT for critical applications.But the proper solution for high availability is clustered applications that dont rely on VMware solutions to handle host failures.  You can have a completely local storage solution if you have redundant VMs in a cluster or multiple stateless web servers behind a load balancer.If one of your hosts goes down then the other VMs providing the same application service automatically carry the additional server load. In this scenario it doesnt matter if you have shared storage or advanced VMware features plus you get real high availability  not Vm restart on another host. The reality is that clustered solutions and load balancing even stateless web servers costs a considerable amount of money and can make VMware Enterprise Plus licensing and the physical SAN and fabric switches seem cheap by comparison especially when you include the considerable man hours to set them up.F LTE virtual load balancers will run  k each so  to load balance stateless web servers or pulling data from a separate clustered DB solution. The clustered DB products are more pricey and you need to add the DB admin to setup and maintain them.  The average pay a qualified DB admin makes almost makes SQL sexy.In the end it is really how deep your pockets are and what your existing infrastructure looks like.  I think a combination of the two is probably what most people will be running. A shared storage VMware cluster if they are using vSphere with a clustered DB backend seems pretty common in large enterprise. I personally have to compromise quite a bit.  No budget allowed for quality SAN and no time to put together a non redundant shared storage appliance plus no clustered DB money so I need to rely on ActiveStandby replication for databases with manual switchover and static redundant web servers behind a load balancer all running on Hosts with local only storage. ,vmware,ctfd3kw,2,t5_2qnan

4807160,0,t1_cu0g9hp,If youre really strapped for cash your best bet would be to build a self service portal in vRealize Orchestrator.  Its free if you own vCenter just download the appliance.  The ideal situation would be that you write the deployment workflows in VRO then use vRealize Automation as the front end where the students request stuff.  But if you cant afford that there is a free thing in VRO called web views that basically lets you publish the input part of a VRO workflow to a web page and from there a student could kick the workflows off themselves depending on AD creds etc.But keep in mind that while VRO has a LOT of prebuilt workflows in it it would be up to you to assemble all the pieces to build a portal that worked the way you want.  We built a portal like this once completely in VRO for the predecessor to VMwares HOL a few years ago and Id say it took a couple of weeks to get it all working right.

In a platform such as Cisco UCS for example you certainly would do it this way vs. dedicated Gb management ports.,vmware,cwbf5vp,2,t5_2qnan

If its the former you wouldnt use  of what makes NSX expensive and I can understand why it would turn you off. If its the latter Im curious what youll be using in its place as an alternative. gt Price for vdi is a fraction of the price for our server cluster. Its  times more expensive to use it for half the machines.This makes me think youre talking about  static lab environments as opposed to a self service internal cloud. To this point you have alternatives in the VDI market to accomplish roughly the same thing. NSX is in a league of its own in many ways. It sounds like you may have just wanted bits and pieces of what NSX offers instead of the full suite. And to that point I wouldnt expect the price of NSX to be remotely justifiable. Not trying to be combative btw. I just see a lot of folks and obviously you have a ton of people that agree with you comment about how the price tag of NSX turns them off.

8425328,0,t1_d5uecnz,gtOkay so what youre saying is that even though my VMs are using thin provisioning not taking up that much actual storage and if I allocate  of the datastore then VMs will stop working? Even though they are not using all of their thin provisioned space on the actual nimble volume?No.  Im saying if the datastore actually fills up then the VMs stop working.  You can put a  TB thin disk on a  TB volume no problem  until it actually uses up  TB and fills the datastore.gtVM goes on DataStore which gets assigned to Volume from our Nimble. We give the Volume TB then the Datastore we make is formats the whole TB of the volume and the VM carves out GB on thin provisioning. The VM isnt using all of that GB but it is carved out to multiple drives on the guest OS. Now we have a  usage alert on that datastore even though thin provisioning is on.Are you saying youre making a  GB thin disk which contains less than  GB of data and youre getting a  usage alert?  That shouldnt happen.  You would get a  provisioned alert if youve configured that but not a usage alert.Are you sure your disks are actually thin?  When you look at the datastore and pick related objects to show VMs on it does it show  GB for provisioned and something less than that like  GB for used?Note that you may have a thin volume at the storage level but you still have to pick thin disk in the VM configuration.  Also if your VM does something silly like write to the whole disk when formatting the filesystem instead of a quick format your disk will inflate using up the whole provisioned amount.In any event if youve allocated exactly enough storage for your VMs on that datastore theres no point in having a disk usage alert for that datastore.  You know you have enough space and youre not going to run out so just turn it off for that datastore.gtEdit I cannot seem to find a good write up on how to configure the datastore disk provisioned trigger properly. It seems like that is what I am really looking to setup.I dont see why it would be.  Provisioned is always going to be higher than used.  I still think youre mixing the terms up.  A  GB thin disk with  GB of data and thus using  GB of actual disk space has  GB provisioned and  GB used.,vmware,d5uphdc,3,t5_2qnan

Its when you go adding more it will hit the ceiling faster than the i with  threads will or an even better virtualization processor like a core Xeon with multithreading.But one VM assuming youre not already running heavy heavy stuff on the Linux base sure.

In this configuration YouTube isnt a problem. I also have one apex  not in production. I demoed it years ago and it did help improve video performance and impact to host CPU. If I remember correctly this is different from the grid card though. Host CPU will still be used for video rendering. The  will only offload the pcoip process from each vm. Check the documentation I think the  supports up to  users per card depending on the clients display resolution.In my case Im looking at picking up more apex cards to use in conjunction with the grid cards to maximize performance.

We also have several vce vblocks that we run the majority of our systems on. In my experience they are not worth the overhead. You are really locked in with their rcm baselines and upgrade schedules and processes.
