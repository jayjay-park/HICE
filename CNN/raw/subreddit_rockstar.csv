2283633,0,t1_cltkxnm,gtAt the time that PS amp  came out they were top of the line as far as gaming machines go even compared to PCsThe  came out in  with MB of RAM. That was a MINIMUM requirement for the newest version of WindowsVista at the time. They were not top of the line.gtWhat you are actually advocating is in most cases p upscaled to p  choppy fps GTA V runs at pfps. Granted Id rather have the fps but itll do for a game like GTA.gtdont mind paying out your ass for games over the next  years Im paying the same amount for new games as PC users do.  per game.gtNO MOD SUPPORT The Xbox team said they are open to having mod support on games if the developers choose that.The real appeal of console gaming is cost and ease of use. You can not get a  PC that runs games like this and will continue to in the future. Consoles get better over timesee  launch games vs end of the generation games. Also with consoles its plug and play really. No trouble shooting no worries. Not everyone needs top of the line graphics they just want to play games and thats the gap consoles fill. Honestly if it wasnt for console gaming gaming would be a tiny industry and PC gaming would have died. ,rockstar,cltz2wp,-2,t5_2t7oi

3899993,0,t1_cr0t2yc,Its a gray area and I can only speak for my own country as we do not have the exact same law as the rest of Europe since we are not a part of the European union. We do however have close relations with EU through a trade agreement called Schengen that does influence quite a lot of our policies even on a national level.I can legally rip CDs and DVDs for my own personal use for example in order to copy them on to my computer or an external player. I am not allowed to copy a CD in order to sell it or give it away to friends or family... Something that was actually legal until quite recently.In regards to games I can crack games as much as I like... But its more difficult in regards to games. Using torrent sites like Pirate bay and the like is illegal but mostly due to the fact that you are uploading as well as downloading files and thus are participating in distributing pirated content.I am allowed to make copies of my own games in order to make backups in case my original disks are lost or broken and I am allowed to crack or in other ways go around any copy protection measures in place to do so. This has been tried as high as in Norwegian supreme court in the case of DVD Jon the guy who cracked the DVD copy protection protocol.However consumer rights in regards to digital products have been detoriating rapidly over the last ten years. Piracy has often been used as an excuse while the result has been that ordinary paying costumers like you and me have been left in the cold. None of the measures that has been put in place to supposidely fight piracy has had any effect on it but it has made it more difficult for honest consumers.In addition to this development a development has been happening in regards to copyright laws but the history here is much longer. Copyright laws originated as a way to ensure that artists and authors had an incentive to make creative works by ensuring that they had an exclusive right to commercial gain of their products for a limited time. It started out as  years or something I believe after the product in question was made available for purchase to the public. In addition these rights where made personal and could not be transfered easily. Over a course of about  years we are now at a point where products are protected for  years after the original author has died... If you take into account that the original intend with copyright was to ensure that the author had an incentive to continue to produce new works its quite ironic to note that the protection now spans  years after the author has died... As far as I know its rather impossible for a dead guy to produce new works after he has died... and I dont think dead people care much about money at all.All of this has been at the expense of consumers but also at other artists expense. Human history is made through the ongoing development of ideas and our culture is the same thing. Disney has built an empire upon developing old tales and stories further yet they have fought tooth and nail in order to prevent others from doing the same. Our entire culture has been commercialized as a result and things like artistic freedom and the inherrant nature of derrivativation in culture is under attack. Thankfully mockery satire and critique is still under legal exeption from alot of these rules... Imagine what GTA would be like without having the ability to draw inspiration from our culture as it is?I have lost quite alot of respect for Rockstar due to this policy. I mean I can somewhat understand why they would try to defend multiplayer from modding... But when it comes to singleplayer I say fuck them. Quite a few people have bought GTA on PC purely because they expect user generated content for it to appair in the future... I just dont get why they oppose it it doesnt make sense for a single player game to fight against single player content... Bohemia Interactive have earned shitloads of money due to DayZ and modding has without a doubt helped sell quite a few copies of Skyrim as well.,rockstar,cr0u0ep,1,t5_2t7oi
