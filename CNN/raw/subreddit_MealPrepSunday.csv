3590074,0,t1_cq1hhnr,None that I have noticed. I let them cool off before tossing on the lids. Otherwise the condensation that forms on the lids can add excess moisture. It also helps to preslice the chicken breast. I find that cooking them in the oven helps them retain excess water.I would avoid the asparagus. They lost all of their crunch by the end of the week.

4677872,0,t1_cthfp8n,Id also add that vegetables can be an extremely cheap part of your diet often cheaper than grains or meat if you know which ones to focus on and which ones especially work well frozen or canned. Frozen veggies that cook well are green beans broccoli peas and also spinach if its not the main ingredient. Frozen berries are also way cheaper than fresh and great to add to yoghurt or make smoothies with. Canned all beans which are usually even cheaper dried but require more time to prepare as well as dried lentils super cheap and versatile and quicker than beans to cook from dry. Among fresh vegetables that tend to be cheap  cents a pound typically the aromatics are at the top onions potatoes sweet potatoes carrots celery sometimes parsnips turnips or beets too. Cabbage and iceberg lettuce are also very inexpensive. What is your current food budget? I tend to spend about  dollars a week including these staples but also quite a bit of more expensive fresh fruits and vegetables and dairy though very little meat.,MealPrepSunday,ctk704a,1,t5_37cer

The towel sheet seemed to keep the moisture in pretty well and didnt really dry out the shell too much. The first tasted about the same as the last about a week apart.

5468714,0,t1_cw6gwrk,gt not too alarming as the size of food in their container probably will not create bacteriae.coli.I actually had this explained to me recently on here. I was confused because according to foodsafety.gov the safe practice is to put food immediately into the fridge not let it cool. However that information is directed towards average dudes storing food in their homes. If you have a very large amount of food such as  in short ribs you should cool it before putting it in the fridge ex. with a huge ass fan because thats too much food to cool down fast enough in the fridge and it will just make everything else warmer too.Where does a weeks worth of meals fall on that spectrum? Depends if you really want to be sure take its temperature after an hour or two.

5715646,0,t3_3taw2b,And this is why I dont meal prep the way most people here do. I hate HATE! reheated meat and for almost  of meals I cant eat them more than x a week. Instead I prep things that make my life easier  cutting up veggies ahead of time preparing healthy snacks cutting up and freezing meat etc. There are a handful of soups I dont mind reheating like potato or carrotsquash soup and sometimes I will make a big pot of that for lunches and pre portion it out into containers. I tried Sunday meal prepping with some light cooking on Wednesday and I ended up throwing away half the food because I couldnt stomach another meal there were a few meals I was literally gagging down... I really dont like microwaved food and just getting takeout which goes completely against the whole point of meal prep! It might not be a popular opinion but I dont think total meal prep works for everyone and I just use this subreddit for inspiration. Edit I dont know why I got downvotes for suggesting that different types of meal prep might work better for different people. ,MealPrepSunday,cx5ky3u,5,t5_37cer

Once it was all cooked.  I removed it from the stove. Preheat the oven for the biscuits as per the instructions on the biscuit can thing.  Take out a portioned biscuit from the can thing and flatten it.  I just used my hands to flatten it cause Im lazy.  Then add the scrambled eggs and turkey bacon and fold the biscuit around the mixture.  Takes a few tries to realize whats the right amount of eggsturkey bacon to put in there.  Stuff all the biscuits or how many ever you want.  Bake according to the biscuit packaging.  I have a box of it in my fridge and grab it on my way out the door.

To keep all air from contacting the guac you can either  use a ziplock bag and roll the bag up with the guac all at the bottom to get the air out. if you prefer to put it in some type of containertupperware you can get all your guac in it and then use some plastic wrap and gently press it down on top of the guac and up the sides of container and the just put the lid on to hold it in place.   Another general tip is the pits of the avocado can be placed back in the guacamole and they also seem to help keep it from browning.I have never frozen guac but if I did I would definitely make sure to get the container as air tight as possible.,MealPrepSunday,d09nhvb,1,t5_37cer

With mason jars you can put dressing first then meats perhaps grape tomatoes and finally your greens cheese if you like before or after the greens. In this way the veggies will be less likely to go bad.If not the above then because it is a Pinterest fad? I dont know I just make my salads every day or two instead of at once.

7757043,0,t3_4lhrif,Usually after steaming veggies I cook them for a couple minutes without the lid on which allows moisture to evaporate. Since youre sauteing the moisture should be evaporating already so here are a couple things that come to mind when I consider moisture management Use less or no oil if youre using already.  If any of these vegetables are coming out of the freezer clean the ice off under running water before sauteing.  Dry them out before cooking.  Throw them in a drainer before packaging. ,MealPrepSunday,d3nx0qs,4,t5_37cer

8202417,0,t3_4rgysn,The more you read recipes the more things youll notice are common to basic dishes from different countries.Minced beef is relatively cheap and can be bought  lean.Fry the beef with onions and make sure it breaks up as it cooks. Pour in a can of chopped tomatoes. This makes a base for loads of dishes. For a morrocan tagine add some morroccan spices and chickpeas. Serve with rice or pita. For a pasta bolognese add some oregano and basil and serve with pasta. For a chille add chilli pepper mexicancajun spice and beans serve with rice. For an Indian keema add curry powder serve with rice or naan.Garlic powder will boost the flavour of any of these so will worcester sauce or soy sauce but you dont need to buy everything in week .Any of these will portion out and freeze well and can be stirred easily as they reheat this makes microwaving easier.A base like this can also be used for lasagne cottage pie pasta bakes etc.As you get more advanced you can always be more authentic and try making your own spice mixes.Frozen peas sweetcorn and chopped peppers can be added to a sauce to add bulk without adding much calories.With rice and pasta just put the dry food in a pot and pour a kettle of boiling water over it turn up the heat on the hob and test the pastarice every  or  minutes until its slightly harder than you like then remove it from the heat and pour through a collanderstrainer. Both are still edible even if theyre a little over or under done. Dont be afraid to get it a little wrong its unlikely itll be so bad its inedible.Dont forget that you only have to satisfy yourself so if you want pasta with chickpeas and morroccan beef thats ok its still food and itll probably still be tasty.,MealPrepSunday,d52utnd,2,t5_37cer

Try new recipes  it stinks to finish lunch and think you have  more days of the same terrible lunch.I also would suggest that you keep them simple particularly at first. Weve done things like rice and then spread some of the frozen vegetablepasta things over the rice cook both first. Not going to win any awards with that but its tasty and easy.I also see frozen burritos a lot particularly for breakfast. Still cant figure a good way to do them that doesnt make the shells hard or mushy. The best Ive come up with is to prep the insides and then wrap in a tortilla at eating time. Defeats the point a little bit but not eating them at all because the shell is weird is worse.,MealPrepSunday,d85rrli,12,t5_37cer

9153807,0,t3_55mtce,In terms of stupid simple ways to cook that require very little effort I highly recommend you check out the Instant Pot Do some reading about them and check out some YouTube videos and youll be sold. Im betting they will be really cheap on Black FridayCyber Monday on Amazon this year. For Prime Day the IPDUO was  normally  and they ended up selling like  of them. Dont cheap out and buy the IPLUX. It doesnt have low pressure setting. That is really handy for steaming vegetables so they dont turn out soggy and mushy.You can try other pressure cookers that are cheaper and Im sure they will work just fine. However I suggest you pay the extra money and buy the Instant Pot because there is a HUGE community behind it and a ton of instructions online in terms of how to do things with the Instant Pot. The instructions may not exactly translate over to other pressure cookers.An example of a meal I make frequently Throw  pounds of FROZEN chicken breast in the pot. Pour  cups of salsa on top of it. Close the lid. Press the manual button and set the cook time to  minutes. After the cooking is finished release the pressure and take off the lid. Use a stiff spatula or a pair of forks to shred the chicken apart inside the pot. Switch the Instant Pot to saute mode and boil off the excess water that came out of the chicken during cooking. Add more salsa and spices if desired and then portion it out.  pounds makes  meals worth of chicken for me. You can trade the salsa out for pretty much whatever sauce you want to use. It can be broth bbq sauce water etc...The best part about it is that  minutes with the Instant Pot yields the same results as  hours in a slow cooker. Oh...and the Instant Pot can be used as a slow cooker too...and as a rice maker.,MealPrepSunday,d8cb7mt,3,t5_37cer

9181099,0,t1_d8fkc3m,Most things reheat better after being thawed.Since fish is such a delicate meat reheating from frozen will overcook the meat and dry it out.Sliced bread thaws out ok I grew up eating sandwiches that used bread from the freezer which by the time I had lunch would just be cool bread.  If you want to use it right away frozen bread also toasts well and works great for grilled cheese sorry you probably cant have those.Pita Bread for dipping hummus or whatnot toss it in the oven while it is preheating flip it a couple times to check to see if it is warm when nice and soft and warm take out of the oven and slice into wedges.For classic pita action wet a paper towel and toss it in the microwave with the pita for best results for about  seconds.

Ive got a new round of recipes and my theme this week was Holy crap I dont have time for this. I work two jobs and the second one spilled over into the entire weekend.  That along with a football game with my family out of town made me resort to many more convenience foods than I normally would but I think I still made better choices than I could have if I wasnt careful.Heres whats in the picture above starting at the top left and going clockwise  ScrambledUp Omelettes Sweet Potato Hotcakes Southwestern Chicken Salad and Chicken Pesto with Cauliflower Rice.   I also sent him with Popchips a Kind Bar and a Carnation Instant Breakfast for his snacks and I had egg salad not pictured with red bell peppers an apple and some asparagus.ScrambledUp Omelettes eggs scrambled  oz package of JennieO turkey Sausage bag of spinachbaby kale mix cups of cut up butternut squashI cooked the butternut squash in the microwave in a bowl with plastic wrap over it and about  teaspoons of water for  minutes.  Heads up that wasnt long enough   Next time Ill do  minutes.  Then I scrambled up the eggs with salt and pepper and dumped them onto a plate when they were almost done.  Then I browned the sausage added the spinach and cooked that down then added the squash and the eggs back into the pot.  I cooked that for another minute or two and mixed it up nicely and then separated it into  bowls.MacrosCalories Fat  gCholesterol  mgSodium  mgCarbs . gFiber  gProtein  gSweet Potato PancakesAt Thanksgiving I made way too much Paleo Sweet Potato Casserole so I froze it.

I used Tyson grilled chicken strips and frozen sauced cauliflower.  Im not too bent out of shape though because I still had good food to eat.  When you cook this in the microwave cook it for  minutes on high.  That will soften the tomatoes so they give up some juice to mix in as well as cook the cauliflower for you. bags of frozen Green Giant Italian Cheese Riced Cauliflower  oz bag of Tyson Oven Roasted Chicken Breast in cubes batch of Ninja Kale and Sunflower Pesto container of cherry tomatoes halvedMicrowave the cauliflower long enough to get it thawed enough to dump into the containers.

10138181,0,t3_5l2xbu,Growing up I thought I hated spinach. Turns out I just hate the nasty soggy spinach that comes out of a can my mom used to always try to get me to eat. Growing up I thought this was the only form spinach came in. Turns out fresh spinach is actually pretty tasty.Same with pretty much any canned or overcooked vegetable both of which seemed to be all the rage in the s when I grew up.Steaming vegetables to the point of crisptender and seasoning with salt and pepper is a good way to go. Many vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower brussles sprouts and carrots can be chopped up mixed with olive oil salt and pepper and oven roasted until slightly caramelized. Mmmmm tasty!Similarly I thought I used to hate meats like chicken steak and pork. Turns out if you dont cook them into shoe leather theyre pretty good. My mom used to cook the absolute shit out of meat until there wasnt a drop of moisture left which is really gross. Properly cooked meats are really good though.At some point in your adult life youre going to have to broaden your food horizons. Part of being an adult is going to social gatherings work functions dinner parties dates etc. where youll be expected to eat whats served and saying eww gross theres lettuce on there! isnt going to be socially acceptable behavior for a fully grown adult.I think the key is getting the preparation right so that both the taste and texture are agreeable to you.,MealPrepSunday,dbt0cg3,3,t5_37cer

10174096,0,t1_dbx9jv6,Ive tried making cauliflower rice twice pulsing in food processor and then sautee and it always turns into mush. I dont know why but I decided its not worth the cost savings as Trader joes has fresh version that freezes great and cost is reasonable. They used to have frozen version  but I didnt see it on my last trip. To cook take out of freezer few minutes before cooking so you can break it up so its not huge block of rice. Saute in few tbsp of olive oil. Few tbsp of water will be in the pan I usually move rice to one side and take water out via paper towels as I think it tastes better browned than basically boiled. Once excess water removed cook few minutes until slightly brown add salt and pepper and or lime as you like. If youre adding cilantro Id add that right when serving as it doesnt hold up well to heat. ,MealPrepSunday,dbxag8r,4,t5_37cer

Take it at face value every dog is an individual.Your vet may even recommend a raw or homemade diet if thats what your dog does best on.
