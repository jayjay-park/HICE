It just means that you need to obtain the right to use it from the owner and in most cases pay royalties to the artist everytime its played.Edit  Here you have all the links you need if you want to obtain music for commercial use.,musicians,clgshdb,2,t5_2qh2l

2477028,0,t1_cmf08ml,Thats a valid answer.  Save up.  The pro gear is definitely worth the price.  However keep in mind that you can record potatoquality stuff and label it as a demo.  If you do two or three songs semidecently you can always post them online for free as a demo.  Thats enough to get you started.  My first album was atrocious.  I mean fucking awful.  I should be jailed for crimes against humanity.  The mix was bad the timings were off the editing was terrible even the composition was subpar.  It was just all across the board awful.I had  downloads by the time I published my second album and removed it.  Over  people listened to that shit storm and went yeah alright I can dig it.  You definitely wont be an overnight sensation with rough quality but there are some people out there that are forgiving enough to go I hear potential here Im interested.  Im one of them.  I may not download it but Ill probably give your Facebook page a like and support you you being a general term here.  Ive seen so many people start pages and never even publish music and still get upwards of a thousand likes real interacting likes mind you because they share lyrics or demos or stuff like that.As far as funding look at your budget.  Do you spend a lot of money frivolously for example?  Once you finish high school youll be able to work moreget a better job.  Dont be afraid to ask around and network.  I have a really nice  job because I asked around and put the word out that I needed a job.  Am I rich?  Fuck no.  But I put the word out that I needed a place and me and a friend went  on a condo for month.  So now my bills are cheap as fuck my income is better than my college friends working retail and the quality of my job is better which allows me to buy better gear pay for professional mixingmastering and being a  job it leaves my nights and weekends open for gigging and practices.  Networking is everything in all aspects of life.One more thing on the saving up thing subscribe to Guitar Center mailing list so you can get coupons.  Pay attention to sales.  Use Craiglist.  Use local music shops.  Dont be afraid of used gear.,musicians,cmhvuo2,2,t5_2qh2l

2612176,0,t3_2owfen,Another Craigslist story here actually. About  years ago I had all these songs I can play every rock band instrument so I recorded them at home with some relatively decent gear and put them up on soundcloud. Then I posted an ad on Craigslist stating I was looking for a band and had a link to my soundcloud. Somebody replied emailed each other for about a month talking interests and goals as far as musicians met up and now hes the bass player in my band. We sought out drummers though mutual friends and online and paper ads in music shops and practice spots and coincidentally an old friend from high school found my ad in a music shop hes the drummer now.On the topic of more professional sites for musicians Ive searched for them and even found one that allowed me to find musicians in my area but they ended up having little content andor no activity so I just stuck with craigslist as poor as it can be sometimes.,musicians,cmzjr1p,1,t5_2qh2l

4489040,0,t3_3ckevh,No one has been more helpful than me.  No one is going to care about my music as much as I do so I dont expect more from anyone else than Im willing to put in myself.  After that though the most important things are having A plan for specifically what you want to do and how youre going to do it.  A story to tell.The best PR agent cant help you if you dont know what you want from a PR campaign.  is it name recognition?  Ticket Sales? Digital Downloads?  If so how many?  More all of the above and a lot dont count as answers.Then you need a story.  What makes you truly different than all of the thousands of other artists trying to break through.  Then once you have those together youll be in a place to decide what support you need to meet your specific goals and the best medium to get your story out there.

Even if a drummer isnt actually there one of the audience members may know somebody. Even though its hard to do any kind of metalcore in an open mic night or acoustic session  it still puts you go is out there and you solidify playing in front of people with your current band members.

6362648,0,t3_42neod,I hope this comment is a little more helpful Imposter syndrome is the big issue for me and other creative professionals. I tend to deal with it by trying my best to ignore it when I think something isnt good enough. Because as long as you keep doing your art it will progressively get better. But you have to start somewhere and even if your first stuff is shit its just a stepping stone on the way to improvement.However my biggest challenge is focusing on picking the project to work on because I have multiple ones and a lot of ideas. The One Thing book has helped me with this subject.I make a full time living being a musician and an audio engineer and its hard to keep believing in your abilities even though deep down inside you know youre good enough.I tend to also think in the Why NOT me? mentality when it comes to doing something. Which basically means that even though I havent done something I might know how to start and since nobody else is doing it I might as well start doing it even if its bad in the beginning.This is beginning to ramble so Ill stop now.
