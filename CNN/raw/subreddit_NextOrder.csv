10578160,0,t1_dd6zmge,No problem. Its only as I understand it however. I saw a spreadsheet with preliminary stats and requirements on it. I went for the Veemon as Rookie and went way over the bottom line for each requirement and got it ,NextOrder,dd71zh1,1,t5_3e7ps
10580287,0,t3_5rhkmg,As they get older if they dont met the requirements to digivolve in time they will die of old age. It cant be avoided its just part of the game but your next digimon will be stronger than your first by inheriting stats from the dead parent. If you want to extend their life there are tamer skills that do it as well as items that can extend their life. But regardless of how long you extend it the digimon will always die of old age eventually just how the game works.,NextOrder,dd79w8p,2,t5_3e7ps
10656111,0,t3_5sh8s2,One thing a lot of people neglect is the buff skills with muscle charge you can do these areas much earlier with the stat boost from muscle charge you can do guardromon around k stats and cape mod the agumons only need around .k and seadramon around .k though k is safer. Keep in mind too the only stats you NEED to have this high are your strength and stamina dont worry about wis or speed and just get like k hp and mp,NextOrder,ddf3gs0,2,t5_3e7ps
10679481,0,t1_ddhhzwj,Perfect! Thanks a bunch! Yeah based on how BlackGatomon acts I figured it was  whether shed actually come back to the city or not. I guess she may just sit there offering up easy money. I know one item she gave me k Bits for so maybe shes doing just as well there anyway! ,NextOrder,ddhia4k,1,t5_3e7ps

By Gen  I am assuming you are probably .K stats and over K health K MP?,NextOrder,ddse0r4,2,t5_3e7ps
10892729,0,t1_de2ytdx,False I EXEed a bunch of times with my WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon ,NextOrder,de3iae6,1,t5_3e7ps
10901695,0,t3_5vs8qx,Thats the only place I could find. If you kill the Greymons and the WereGarurumon in the house you actually make a profit in terms of bits with a maxed out Birdramon at least so its not that bad. You should also be able to trade for some with Tyrannomon. ,NextOrder,de4fkpa,1,t5_3e7ps
