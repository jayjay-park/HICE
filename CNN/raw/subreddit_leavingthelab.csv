3624442,0,t1_cq5d7nk,Ok what field do you want to be top in? In science its very hard to be at the top of the chain without a Ph.D.Beware that at this point in your graduate schooling its hard to see the forest for the trees.  Burnout is a real thing.  If you want to be a functioning part of industry with a great salary a Masters is a wonderful option.  However you will never head an RampD lab with a Masters and you will never be a CSO of a company.  If pure science is your aim understand that leaving with a Masters will build your glass ceiling in the field.  ,leavingthelab,cq5evza,4,t5_33l7v
