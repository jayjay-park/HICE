The one factor I could imagine may be the increased amount of stress you are probably experiencing. I would think that would influence your dreams in a negative nightmarish way.,MattShea,d0t3d73,1,t5_2zcwa
6860385,0,t3_49jb82,I know most of the time when I am dreaming or not. But when I have a really bad nightmare I am just to busy with that terrible thing in my dream so I dont think about if its real or not XD. But I can wake up if I want so thats nice. I absolutely love dreaming because I always dream crazy shit in so much details and I can tell it to people days after that night yas.Im in love with your channel Matt! I spend hours every day watching your videos and you seem to be such a fantastic person and I love how you care so much about your subscribers.
