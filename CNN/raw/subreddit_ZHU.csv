8443252,0,t3_4vaab1,Not trying to be a dick but I feel like his die hard fans are all here lol. People that genuinely enjoy his music for its layers and smooth sexy vibe. Not because they heard faded on the radio. His music has made me question myself more than any other piece of art or expression. And to me thats the whole point of music. I love this community and I always come here to be the first to know whats going on. ,ZHU,d5wy19v,8,t5_358up
