6118957,0,t1_cykrp7y,thanks alot .x. I understand I only seek comfort if I talk for hours only because in the past I use to have timed therapy and it drove me bananas... I deal better with untimed. I am okay if the person has commitments just as long as taking isnt  mins long .m. that is pretty much useless. till  mins  wayyy too short. It takes me  minutes to warm up to a person which is why in half an hour I feel like I didnt even begin to explain the situation. That is especialy true if you visit a therapists office and theyre not even listening to you half the time. . hours  I feel I can deal with. More  on my own Ill end the convo unless I am really distressed beyond belief. Thanks for the suggestion though Ill see if I can use it ,7CupsofTea,cyl5uda,2,t5_2xjxd
7986941,0,t1_d4clhq0,I feel the criticism is very valid. A lot of the incentives on cups come in form of achievements badges cheers compassion hearts and so on when it should come completely off enjoying helping others.An internship that needs to send  referrals to be completed? Thats not really an actual internship. A proper evaluation of how the user was in the internship would fit far better but unfortunately due to cups idea of not being able to read anything at all from chats thats not really possible. The uncertainty in bad reports comes from the same problem with no chat logs. Someone could easily throw in several reports on different guest users to troll and the Listener would get a coaching moment email about how to improve as if they did something wrong.There are so many questionable things about how cups works that isnt only related to the fact that you can freely sign up and randomly assign answers to the mock chat and quiz.I really dont agree with cups idea that decent odds of a horrible Listener that might make your troubles worse is worth the less queue times by having many people able to accept people from the queue and hope they get a good Listener.Thatd be a bit acceptable for some more casual types of chat where people are more sane and likely to just ignore it and leave but we are literally talking about people with depression getting paired with people saying they should stop feeling bad because its really not that big a problem.This got a lot longer than I expected but I could speak volumes about the community and some worrying trends.,7CupsofTea,d4dt3sl,3,t5_2xjxd

10701651,0,t1_dd9ekud,Listeners get tested by the anonymous evaluation team and theres a good chance Ive been tested before so Im not threatened at all. I just like to think members can trust listeners a little more meaning they dont feel they have to test us to make sure theyre going to have a good experience. I know thats not the members faults it is  Cups tha holds that responsibility. gtI am not. I am talking about leaving reviews for abusive aggressive or just outright terrible listeners mainly the ones who surprise dont respect boundaries but also some aggressors who have told me that I am too ugly to rape and worse and then those reviews not showing up on the reviewed listeners profile.They get reviewed by admin and the listener will be spoken to and given more training. Of course if youve stated that theyve outright insulted you theyll be suspended or may be completely removed. Reviews arent ignored positive or negative. ,7CupsofTea,ddjsns0,1,t5_2xjxd
