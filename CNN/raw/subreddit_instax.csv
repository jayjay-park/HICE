8933067,0,t3_52n8vn,Ive had my instax mini  for about a year now recently the light on the aperture knob wont change but I can see the aperture in the lens changing so Im assuming its still working even though the light isnt. Yet I took these photos outside at about  pm it wasnt cloudy and I have no idea why theyre so dark when I had them on the highest lighting setting. ,instax,d7lmfdw,2,t5_2sdq7
