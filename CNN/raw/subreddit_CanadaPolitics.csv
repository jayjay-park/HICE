Their problem is that they also have a great talent for spending money as well.  Theyre certainly ravenous for cash but the size of their appetites is the major factor.And the claim that having to ask for money is making politics meaner is obviously false.

To paraphrase a remark by Milton Friedman economists may not know much but they do know how to produce a shortage or surplus. Price ceilings which prevent prices from exceeding a certain maximum cause shortages..gtThe incentives to evade controls are ever present and the forms that evasion can take are limitless. The precise form depends on the nature of the good or service the organization of the industry the degree of government enforcement and so on. One of the simplest forms of evasion is quality deterioration. In the United States during World War II fat was added to hamburger candy bars were made smaller and of inferior ingredients and landlords reduced their maintenance of rentcontrolled apartments..gtNot only do producers have an incentive to raise prices but some consumers also have an incentive to pay them. The result may be payments on the side to distributors a bribe for the superintendent of a rentcontrolled building for example or it may be a fullfledged black market in which goods are bought and sold clandestinely.gtThis does not mean that there are no circumstances in which temporary controls may be effective.

97275,0,t3_1v55w4,Well this is a fair bit of misleading cherrypicking with debate reframing at the end and is so filled with outrage and pandering that its hard to address in detail. This opens with the statement that the CPC supports science by saying that total science and technology spending is up which is incredibly misleading and at least as bad as anything the CBC has done lately. That figure includes giving money to businesses for all sorts of reasons and doesnt say much about science funding. The CIHR hasnt had funding to keep up with inflation for years let alone inherent rising costs of research and the way the government has spent money to attack projects like the ELA by impeding takeover from other parties shows that a simple belttightening is not the sole motivation of the CPC at least when environmental science is the concern. A less vitriolic article would be worth addressing pointbypoint but this isnt so Ill just leave it at this.The notion that you have to ask fired scientists to hear concerns or that the CBC is on some mad leftist misinformation campaign is absurd plenty of respectable apolitical international sources like Nature report on this as well for anyone who doesnt trust the CBC and recasting outrage from scientists as the left looking for something to get mad at is shameful.If CPC supporters want to say why its not a big deal or even that its good that the CPC is reducing funding for basic science thatd be fine.

Canada Post is a normal corporation that just happens to have the government as their only shareholder but the government cant micromanage them the way they would be able to micromanage a government department.The best they can really do is give them exemptions on regulations that other companies are required to abide by which they have already done several times and and are doing again  The government has given CP a considerable amount of assistance.gt What if they had taken the prifuts since  and reinvested it. Do you think the bull market since that point would have greatly increased the value of the investments and cleared up most of the problem? I doubt it.  I wouldnt be surprised if losses this year and next are bigger than all of the profits theyve had since .

140223,0,t1_ceu6jmw,gt Why not? This is what people wanted take the ability away to raise large donations from individuals corporations and unions and this is what youre left with. Small individual donations from large numbers of people. If you dont like it whats the alternative?Ive written about this before but personally Im for fully publicly financed elections with some sort of ranked ballot so that people are not forced to choose between money for the party they support in ideology and the party they support in practice.When parties rely on donations as their main source of funding AND the spending on campaigns by parties continues to go up parties are then forced to appeal largely to those who donate as opposed to those who cast ballots.  These two groups overlap but not entirely.   A system which encourages party to first chase money prior to chasing voters is not one I support.  I understand the liberty argument against publically financed elections and if there is a will to maintain this Id argue elections Canada needs to significantly lower campaign spending limits during elections and start putting them in place outside of elections to limit the need for funding.  Campaign financing is like advertising large amounts of it are not inherently useful  rather what matters is the relative spending between parties.  As spending goes up other parties must spend more in return in order to maintain their reach.  Unless this is heavily restricted this will continue and more time and money must be dedicated to simply raising more money and spending less time on the politics. ,CanadaPolitics,ceuegh1,2,t5_2s4gt

164608,0,t1_cex63vb,gtThats nice but if the reason unions can be involved in politics is because they are democratic institutions I would ask why not democratic business organizations like chambers of commerce?Because trying to create these comparisons ignores the entire history behind the creation of social democratic parties across the globe. Most socialdemocratic parties were quite simply created when unions in X country decided they could accomplish more by also advocating for their membership in the political realm not just in the workplace. To try to create equivalence now ignores the very base of these parties and to advocate removing the connection would essentially be saying the NDP in its current formation cannot exist CCF and CLC merger. gtCurrently my dues will go to supporting the NDP should the union be allowed to do that despite the fact Im an avowed neoLiberal? Involvement is an individual choice not done on behalf of others. I cant have my membership dues paid with somebody elses money for example.Due to the democratic nature of a union if you disagree with what they are doing you have the ability to influence change by getting involved. Considering the complacency of the average Canadian I would bet youd have some success.

The decision in Bedford did not prescribe specific conditions for reform but its general overview talked about possibly permitting tradeoffs within the current set of rules provided the resulting legal system made sense as a coherent wholegt   I have concluded that each of the challenged provisions considered independently suffers from constitutional infirmities that violate the Charter.  That does not mean that Parliament is precluded from imposing limits on where and how prostitution may be conducted.  Prohibitions on keeping a bawdyhouse living on the avails of prostitution and communication related to prostitution are intertwined.  They impact on each other.  Greater latitude in one measure  for example permitting prostitutes to obtain the assistance of security personnel  might impact on the constitutionality of another measure  for example forbidding the nuisances associated with keeping a bawdyhouse.  The regulation of prostitution is a complex and delicate matter.   It will be for Parliament should it choose to do so to devise a new approach reflecting different elements of the existing regime.That paragraph suggests that no easy solution is possible without careful consideration of Charter rights.  It does not prescribe a method by which Parliament could effectively ban prostitution.,CanadaPolitics,cf5vu18,2,t5_2s4gt

Why is it that offIsland hospitals have better regional funding than Montreal? Why are there better studenttoteacher ratios? It begs the question if Montreal is paying the majority of the freight why does it not merit better attention from the province? But who gives a shit? Lets get to the real meat . Anglophones have lived in Qubec for centuries sidebyside with the French yet Francophones act as if they I say they because I have seamlessly transitioned into Toronto.... are a vestigial organ in the provincial corpus. It has become politically expedient to assail allophones and anglophones for their purported lack of integration into the cultural fabric of Qc. If Anglophones are as the PQ has said an important aspect of the province whose rights are best defended in an independent Quebec read The English Speaking Community An Integral Part of a Sovereign Quebec  then why does the PQ raise the spectre of tougher language laws as a barometer of protection of the French community? Are Allophones being tempted by English and if so is further vilifying languages other than French going to change that? As sociologists have shown many immigrants view English as a necessary for future success would it not be better then to make French a language  of success?. How does Quebec envision independence working exactly? Currency issues? Trade issues? CanadaQuebec relations? These are the tough meaty questions that seem to be categorically ignored by your leaders. Gilles Duceppe envisioned an EUstyle agreement with Canada encompassing joint currency and political institutions. This has been echoed by many leaders including Bouchard and Levesque. How would that work? How would Quebec negotiate with Canada?  These are questions that are bandied about and maybe even given a road map without any solid planning behind it. . Remember the CEGEP debacle where they debated keeping Francophones out? How does the government envision protecting Francophones through embargos and regulation i.e. blocking certain websites in Quebec a la Urban Outfitters that do not have a French portion? Are Quebecers so weak as to need the government to protect them? Just a few questions. ,CanadaPolitics,cfou3ng,18,t5_2s4gt

486029,0,t3_1znk2m,If I can read one thing from the PQ and BQ posts in this thread its that the Separatist option is woefully unprepared for the really nasty job that awaits them in rebalancing Quebec to be a country.Im putting  down now on endless angst and gnashing of teeth when Montreal demands to be recognized as a distinct society in a united and free Quebec.Realistically I think it would be far more likely for Montreal to become an Autonomous Republic within Quebec. I understand its all the rage in the old world these days and would North Americas great francophone metropolis from being governed by the semisenile raging KentuckyNorth xenophobes from the parochial hinterland or by snide condescending jackasses like myself from the dark heart of the ROC in Toronto neither of which seem to be particularly loved there.And with the threat of them just up and leaving with no military option to stop them whining really really loud and mass printing more reports than have ever been printed before dont count as military options and with the real prospect of being reduced to New Brunswick Light if the City did leave the new Quebec Federal Government would have little choice but to give Montreal well whatever the heck it wants.Alas I expect Quebecs desperation would lead it to give way more to keep Montreal than Canada might be willing to  and so Montreal would use Canada as a bargaining foil to extract blood from the Regions stone of oldcloth Quebec.And for the record since Quebec lacks a constitution in waiting any failed constitution not to Montreals liking is easy pretext for separation as is very well recognized in international law and is precisely how quite a few countries got started.Heck as a fun bit of history this is how cities became what they are today leveraging their power to insist upon their ancient and established rights.

Although those people often first settle in ethnic enclaves as time passes they and their children do succeed in integrating into Canadian society. This pattern happened over and over again in the course of the th century with immigrants from Italy Greece Ireland and Eastern Europe and its happening with immigrants from the Middle East and Asia today.Third your proposal would mean that Canada would no longer accept the over  Americans over  French and over  Britons we admitted as permanent residents to Canada in .

544763,0,t1_cg2692f,Im going to make three points here as before.First I think you have a skewed perception of our immigration system. Most of Canadas federal governments and especially our current government have viewed and view our immigration system primarily as an economic driver and not as a vessel of humanitarianism. There are three classes of immigrants in Canada economic class family class and refugee. Economic class immigrants are people we bring into the country so that we can have a skilled and educated workforce. Family class immigrants are relatives of economic class immigrants admitting these people into Canada helps us attract people in the economic class. Refugee class immigrants are the only ones who could be characterized though not entirely accurately as leeching off our system although our governments have been willing to let these people in for humanitarian reasons.   Economic class immigrants are by far the largest category of immigrants who come into Canada. According to the government in  we admitted  economic immigrants  familyclass immigrants and  refugees. Refugees just dont make up a very large proportion of immigrants.   Nor do they make up a large portion of our total population refugees in Canada number about . Most refugees live not in Canada but in countries that share a land border with other countries where there are serious conflicts the country with the most refugees is Pakistan whose refugee population is about . millionSecond point immigrants in Canada are not comparable to immigrants in Europe or even the United States. The immigration policy of many European countries is to bring in lowskilled workers actively try to exclude them from mainstream society and then be indignant when these people fail to integrate. This is the German Gastarbeiter model. Canadas policy as mentioned above is to bring in highskilled highly educated immigrants in our economic class and to integrate them into society. Our policy has worked quite well for social integration when compared to Europe.  Canada is also blessed by geography. We dont share a land border with a poor country whose inhabitants would have strong incentives to emigrate illegally for economic reasons. Illegal immigration happens in the U.S. and Germany all the time. Its much harder for someone to cross into Canadas borders without the permission of our government.Third I think you underestimate how different the earlier European immigrants were from mainstream Canadian society and I also think you underestimate how Canadian these immigrants and their descendants feel. I can use a personal example. My grandmother is a mostly illiterate highly religious woman who came to Canada in  at age  and almost immediately was set up to marry a man she barely knew with whom she had children in the same year. She knew no English when she arrived. She was highly fertile and had four children. She worked as a seamstress. The town she grew up in was to put it delicately a shitholeher family was so poor that she had to share bathwater with her three sisters while she grew up. Her circumstances in short were exactly like those of many people who might be rejected as immigrants today for having too few skills. And yet although she is often shy in public she feels a stronger attachment to Canada than to her home country which has changed dramatically since she left and her children and grandchildren feel much more Canadian than they do any other ethnicity. I have dual citizenship but my knowledge of my grandmothers language is far from fluent my mannerisms are thoroughly those of educated Torontonian white people and I feel a much much stronger attachment to Canada than I do to my grandmothers home country. The existence of Omni TV doesnt prevent either me or my grandmother from watching the CBC. Actually I think my grandmothers favourite show is Dr. Oz but the influence of American media in Canada is a subject for another day. I am fully Canadian and so is my grandmother even though her situation was like that of many residents of poor countries today.

As people we are not predisposed biologically to certain behaviors merely because of shared DNA.

That simply doesnt hold up to scrutiny  The evidence is less conclusive for marijuana but it does seem that it can result in longterm months to years changes both to the brain and hormonal system when consumed regularly especially in children  and some of the people being prescribed marijuana are children.gt Im not sure why the fuss about clinical tests keeps coming up except perhaps do to doctors looking at the substance from an entirely different perspective than those who use it and are familiar with itOne of the areas mostly unexplored for marijuana and its active components in medical treatment is the psychiatric area.  Marijuana offers considerable potential for improvement for people suffering from insomnia anxiety depression mood regulation disorders and potentially even psychotic symptoms.Its also linked to schizophrenia and negative psychiatric symptoms including depression and selfharming behaviours later in life.  The direction of causal relationship if there is one has not been established.  Its very possible even likely that people predisposed to developing these symptoms enjoy marijuana more or find it to soothe their symptoms and so prefer it.  But its certainly not ruled out that marijuana can cause psychotic symptoms in those predisposed.One of the fundamental principles of toxicology and medicine in general is that effects are dosedependent.  Theres no reason to doubt this is true about marijuana and its active components like THC CBD and so on.   g of absorbed THC should have similar effects when repeated and should have similar rates of negative side effects at the population level.   g will have a very different and much milder effect compared to  mg.It may prove to be safe to give low doses to people with predispositions to psychosis and dangerous to give very high doses.  Whats the dose necessary for seizure suppression but which avoids the undesired sideeffects which for many users would include getting high when they cant be or dont want to be?We dont know yet.

Between  and  their proportion as home speaker dropped by  which went to anglophones and the situation will only continu. Not to mention that in the same period all other French speaking minorities saw their assimilation rate grow to unsustainable rate which lead to the French communities of Ontario to stagnate and get passed by the provinces overall growth while those of Manitoba NS and Saskatchewan shrank in size significantly.What you think of Qubec is irrelevant to the reality of Canadas French speaking minorities.

765284,0,t1_cgr3n9j,Respectfully I disagree.  I think that unlike TWUs views on sexuality racism is basically universally looked down on in Canada as a bad thing. The prevalence of yeah Im racist and thats okay is incredibly rare.  There are racist events but they are condemned.  The exception is socalled reverse racism but even then racism is so universally condemned that those defending it often cannot bring themselves to call it racism.  And honestly I dont think socalled reverse racism is much of a problem in Canada.  My point is simply that while there are comparisons to be made between interracial marriage objections and this case there are also differences.  Not surprisingly one of the lawyers making a statement in that video said it a LOT more clearly than I did.

But just for a moment.All of the information we need to compile the NDPs request has been gathered since the TFW program began.  This program began relatively recently e.g.  or so long after any questions about standards or best practices or OOP or anything was still on the table long after spreadsheets became common in offices long after management teams began demanding summary statistics in order to gauge their successes.There is considerable legislation surrounding the program which is not quite loved by all Canadians.  My own experience with IT publicly and federally suggests that a new important somewhat contentious program such as the TFW program associated with new untried legislation demands meticulously maintained records.  And from the point of view of an effective able administrator it is impossible NOT to have this sort of information available in order to make sensible wellbacked decisions.You keep talking about table joins and while your comments are cogent and correct the point of view is a little narrow.  I assure you this sort of thing is trivial.  Look at the information requested.  This sort of information is exactly the sort of thing a private industry Cteam member wants and demands and gets.

Its encouraging CPC supporters to think of the constitution and courts as things that impede tyrannicalmajority democracy rather than protecting rights from a potentially capricious and arbitrary government.

That is wrong and harms the company a lot.But the third legitimate problem of trying to obfuscate these problems under a layer of technobabble that is inexcusable and they should be fined.

1283866,0,t3_28shnj,Former SK Teacher here and I apologise now that this reply got WAY longer than I had originally intended In my first year teaching I had to go through contract negotiations.  I had a tough time getting behind the wage increase because I had just started was making more than I ever had before in my life and was well aware of the wage when I started.  I felt a little worse for older teachers who had seen their wages not keep up with the rate of inflation over the years but it wasnt why I was frustrated.I was frustrated because for all they want to regulate in the classroom standardised testing specific number of minutes every day there seems to be obvious things they should be watching that are being ignored Split classrooms two or more grades in the same room with the same teacher.  How is that logical?  Doing twice as much teaching in the same amount of time?  And youre going to tell parents that their children are getting the same quality education as they would if they were in their own classroom?  Bullshit. Limits on Class size.  My one friend was teaching  Grade s while I was teaching  Grade s and  Grade s  total and my other friend had  children in grades   and  all in the same classroom.  You want to tell me that all those children received the same quality education? Resources.  I taught French Immersion FI and the lack of resources was disgusting.  Often the curriculum is developed before the resource.  Big changes are made to what we should be teaching but they do not consider giving us a textbook that we could use with the children.  One year as I was teaching Social Studies to almost  FI kids there was  copy of the textbook available for loan from the downtown central office for a maximum of  weeks and it was the same textbook all the Grade  teachers in our city needed.  And no higherups in my school division saw this as a problem.  Dont even get me started on the language used in our FI resources  theyre written for people who are way more advanced in French than a yearold learning it at school for a few hours every day. Appropriate placements.  I have a degree for high school education.  I love that age level I did my internships at that level and thrived I loved teaching.  However my first few placements were in elementary school.  I dont know why but my city withholds high school positions as if theyre some sort of reward you get for being a good elementary school teacher.  But to me teaching elementary school and high school are about as similar as being trained in brain surgery and asked to perform surgery on a heart.  Yeah I might have seen the procedure being done and could maybe replicate it but if something goes wrong I do not have the bag of tricks at my disposal that a specialist would.  So I was thrown into elementary school with a bunch of kids that needed me to figuratively and literally hold their hands through the most basic things and I couldnt handle it.  When I asked for advice I was told that it isnt so hard.  The Phys. Ed. major who taught my friends Grade  English class could not do justice to it and my friends education suffered for that.  We specialize for a reason just give us a position in our specialty.TLDR I feel that the focus in media and also by unions is too often on salary when the discussion could benefit from some talk about other things that would make teaching a more productive work environment.I would also just like to add that if the profession seemed more desirable we would get smarter people into the field and those smarter people would be teaching the future generation.  Anyone who is smart now is smart enough to stay away from this thankless profession that chews up your soul and spits it back out to you at the end of June saying Enjoy your two months of vacation you slacker.,CanadaPolitics,cie1v7j,52,t5_2s4gt

Further youve insulated the Ministry from getting elected themselves or even being accountable to Parliament. Now not only do they have a majority in the House of Commons who will vote whatever bill or budget they wish to pass you also have a government that doesnt ever have to step foot in Parliament. They get to avoid scrutiny from the Opposition in Parliament. Finally people no longer get to elect the government who is no longer accountable to Parliament. The electorate doesnt get to be so dissatisfied with a Minister of the Crown that they wont reelect that Minister when given a chanceRight now the Opposition can question the government both with written and spoken questions as well as vote against government motions and the electorate can choose to not reelect ministers who displease them. Youre worried about confidence motions but youve just thrown the baby out with the bathwater.There are more elegant solutions to the problem of always having the government win confidence motions in Parliament. For example adopt an electoral system where a party that wins . of the popular vote gets . of the seats in the House of Commons thus becoming a minority government always under the threat of losing a confidence motion.gtIt blows my mind that you think that the top  appointed positions in a bureaucracy of hundreds of thousands of people need to be filled with elected MPs to be controllable. Its proveably the opposite.I dont agree further I think what you are proposing would make this de facto true. If they arent controllable now with the checks and balances our system has they sure wont be controllable at all with the system you are proposing.gt They get the power to do that defying because they know they are NEVER going to vote themselves out of office and the other MPs are powerless to do anything about it.Which is why we need to elect a new government.

Or say an auto manufacturer since any individual plant is pretty much automatically going to be too large for any individual worker to have any meaningful control over their workplace. Honestly your entire argument seems to be predicated on the idea that we can ignore the concept of economies of scale. Companies get large because its often more efficient for them to do so. Breaking them up just for the sake of keeping them small doesnt seem like a very good idea. gt B If you replace company and depending on context corporation with country worker cooperative and other variations in spellingphrasing like coop with democracy and shareholder owned with oligarchic or aristocratic youll get an arguement against democratic countries.I likewise wouldnt support paying some government workers significantly less than they could be getting in the private sector just to allow them to afford to pay other workers more than they could be getting paid in the private sector.

I would not be doing so if I did not feel I was being adequately compesnated compared to what I could be making as a civilian working in industry.

The witness argued that this would violate a prostitutes s. b freedom of expression and s.  right to life liberty security charter rights because by making purchasing sex illegal her clients wouldnt feel protected by the law and so would resort to nonlegal ways to enforce their interests if buying sex is illegal then he cannot sue the prostitute who rips him off so you he robs her if buying sex is illegal then buying sex becomes covert which makes it more difficult for the prostitute to get help or evidence if buying sex is illegal then the purchaser is more likely to flout the law hes already committing a crime so maybe hes more likely to assault or rape etc.. This was kind of synthesized to if you make a persons interaction illegal then you violate the interactees Charter Rights by making that them more vulnerable.The MP didnt like this reasoning were prohibiting buying sex because its a crime against women! Now theyre arguing that its Charter violation to ban this sexual behaviour against women because it prevents women from safely engaging in this crime against them? Why dont we just make rape legal then he asks rhetorically? Surely if rape is legal then the rape will be safer. You know what? The crime of sexual assault is probably already a Charter violation because by criminalizing the rapists behaviour its putting the woman at increased risk of murder etc. And therefore the rhetorical question were your charter rights violated when rape is criminalized.The attempted argument makes sense if you assume that prostitution is already a sex crime and you acknowledge that the MP was being rhetorical deliberately trying to find a hole in the witnesss reasoning.TLDR Assume that prostitution and rape are both crimes against women if criminalizing the purchase of sex is a charter violation because it makes women more vulnerable to their johns then why isnt the criminalization of rape a charter violation for the same reason? Obviously there are huge distinctions there but the MP wanted the witness to put it on the record shed be forced to say something like Prostitution isnt a crime against women or its a balance  prostitution isnt as dangerous as rape either of which put the MP can work with.,CanadaPolitics,cirrudc,2,t5_2s4gt

The CPC supporter would have every reason to ask the difficult questions and the rules could stipulate it must be passed on but the moderator would have no incentive to interrupt the answer and could refuse to ask the question again once it had been properly answered.

Winnipeg still has surface parking lots all over the downtown and until a few months ago Katz had done nothing on his election promise to improve that. The Police HQ debacle speaks for itself. Our rapid transit keeps getting pushed back he has done virtually nothing except for a  KM stretch along pembina highway to promote bike transit or improve bike infrastructure.

Under normal circumstances firms could address this shortage by raising wages. Since they werent allowed to do so legally however firms attracted workers by offering fringe benefits including healthcare.

1751283,0,t1_cjzt8bq,Theres an inherent conflict in the job description.gt Agreed. A lot of people forget that public servants are the employees of the government. And as the employer the government should exercise some authority over what can or can not be said.These public servants are also scientists which makes them more than simple advisors and implementors of policy.  The dissemination of science  via open publications to the public and scientific community at large  is a distinct and inherent part of the job description.Articles like this blur the lines deliberately? between commentary on science and commentary on policy.  Part of that is because the line is indeed fuzzy but I tihnk that part of it is also because the less clearcut the issue seems the easier it is to come down hard on the side of prior restraint.In particular the biggest problem seems to be with expressing direct and likely conclusions of a scientific work in laymens terms for the public.As a constructed example would it be improper for a cityemployed meteorologist to advise the public about their prediction of likely rain if the city were holding a parade the next day and official policy expressed every confidence that it would be sunny?gt Nobody wants a government to second guess the conclusion of a study just because some scientists have publicly shown contempt for the government or their policies.Thats putting the cart before the horse.  If government scientists arent doing good science then they arent doing their jobs to begin with.  Furthermore wouldnt public contempt be a good thing?  If that is an indicator of unscientific bias then private contempt would be equally so but it would also be harder to spot.gt Moreover public servants from other departments are operating by the same rules without controversy. Why should Environment Canada be exempted?My hunch is that Environment Canada employs more research scientists than other departments so it will come up more often.  Many other fields are primarily funded via universitylevel research and NSERCSSERC grants which obviously dont come with government control over public statements.Additionally the research conducted by EC is more likely than most to be directly related to matters of ongoing public debate and interest.  The government criticizes biologist in memo story is a decent example.

1817738,0,t3_2fal31,I graduated from UBC in  and then left the province for work so the Liberal changes to education didnt impact me personally that much but I have several friends who are BC teachers. When I say I think your summary has glossed over THE MOST IMPORTANT PART of the whole dispute I may be biased.You know who isnt biased though? The courts. The BC supreme court has twice ruled that removing class size and composition from the negotiations was worse than illegal it was unconstitional. When you get that sort of verdict the governments legitimate options are to do what the court says  appeal or invoke the notwithstanding clause. When they did none of that the first time around it makes me think the Liberals know theyre in the wrong but are hoping a might makes right argument will work hence the union breaking tactics theyre using. When the government tries to use force to evade the constitution I get really worried.Linking teacher wages to performance is not something I think can be realistically done as they have no control over how good the students they get are. Teachers are but one factor in how well a student performs and expecting them to own all the other factors is not right. Pay is also not the teachers first concern as demonstrated by them accepting less pay in exchange for class size and composition guarantees. The Liberals ripped those up in  which made a lot of us say they were worse than the devil since he kept his deals.I have also not personally experienced the negative experiences of large classes or special needs students as I was in immersion and IB where those conditions do not exist. However Having dealt with the disruption poor workers cause in the workplace and how dealing with their problems means you cant give even minimal guidance to your decent workers I can see that class size and composition could be issues.I see the signing bonus as purely a bargaining tool but until the government moves on class size and composition not one that should be dropped yet.Now your questions.Yes I support the teachers because I know several of them and because I dont see the government negotiating fairly. The Liberals were spanked twice by the courts they should have accepted their medicine the first time and this would have been resolved years ago. The Liberal bleating about not having the money holds no water as they dont have the same limits as a household budget. By not putting the money back into public education while funding private education says scary things about their priorities.A wage increase is reasonable as they sacrificed a wage increase as part of the deal for class size and composition. If the Liberals had bought the teachers off with more pay when they stripped the class size and composition from the CBA it would be a different story. Exactly what is a fair wage increase I dont know.I see the stipend as a straight up bribe to get the public to ignore what the Liberals have done to education in this province and assist in the efforts to break the teachers union. If the final deal results in teachers getting back pay or a signing bonus that covers the strike period then it is a stupid and expensive bribe.The BCTF is a union fighting for its life and as such is going to play hardball. While their overt support to the NDP past election has bitten them in the butt when the government ignores the courts you gotta fight back somehow.Finally I hope for your sake that the problems that were born in  are resolved in time for you to graduate HS and apply to a tertiary institution.,CanadaPolitics,ck87ywk,2,t5_2s4gt

According to practice replies are to be as brief as possible to deal with the subject matter raised and to be phrased in language that does not provoke disorder in the House.gt Ministers may answer questions defer their answers make short explanations as to why they cannot furnish an answer at that time or say nothing.Quite obviously Parliamentary Secretary Paul Calandra did none of these things with his nonanswers.

Now if Everyone in canada drove to fort mcmurry to haul the earnings are going to fall substantially Not because profit has fallen but because available labour force has risen and subsequently so has the surplus value as there is going to be more competition for the same jobs whereas now there is high demand for workers to come and fill positions. So everyone cannot choose to become rich. Also not everyone is able to pack up and run off to Fort mc and many may have moral issues with the environmental impact of said industry  off topic. What may be morally problematic is how much wealth companies such as syncrude take from the land and the labour of their workers and how little is given back to the country of their workers... and the carbon bomb that is the tar sands... but another topic ,CanadaPolitics,ckv913h,5,t5_2s4gt

When issues of pay equity or equal pay for equal work come up in fields that are dominated by one gender there is a very clear process to determine if there are equity issues and where the wagesbenefits etc need to adjusted to. It is important to note that both the union and the employer are involved in the entire process. One of the first stages of the process is job evaluation. In the collective agreement which is again agreed to both by the employer and union the job evaluation formula will be clearly denoted. Essentially jobs are broken down by the various components and given scores. For example a job with an education requirement of high school would score low in that area where as a requirement of a masters degree would score high.Many facets of the job skills required etc are broken down in this fashion. From those quantitative figures a like job can be selected. Its easiest in cases where you can use a comparable job within house but sometimes cases are forced to look outside. So while some requirements might be different and some specific tasks might be different what matters is the scoring of the job. Which to reiterate is ultimately agreed upon by the employer and union. This is why pay equity cases can take so long. If ultimately it is determined that job A was being paid unfairly when compared to job B then appropriate measures are taken to fix the imbalance. This happens in both the public and private sectors though less often in the private sector due to lower union density. ,CanadaPolitics,clnah6j,8,t5_2s4gt

The best public health officials in the world doubt the effectiveness of these bans and to ignore them is security theater that runs contrary to the public interest.Lastly and maybe most importantly to the highly self interested unless you have a global quarantine of these countries which you wont the most effective thing to do is to solve the outbreak on the ground where it is happening.

With limited funds higher potency cannabis allows them to get higher than they otherwise would due to a lack of funds.  It also allows them to smoke less per dollar spent which enables them to smoke it more often since they can consume smaller amounts for each session.There is well known connection between price and consumption for every other substance including highly addictive ones and while I dont have data for cannabis in particular I dont see why it wouldnt apply here too since higher potency cannabis effectively lowers the amount of money needed to consume more of it andor to  do it more often.Even if this only applied to  of people and  already had all the money they ever needed to get as high as they wanted as often as they wanted which I seriously doubt there would be no effect on this  but still a negative effect on this  which still represents an overall worsening of this situation.,CanadaPolitics,cm3f6wl,1,t5_2s4gt

It was quite well done and Id recommend it to everyone here.A few other good ones Big ideas from TVO basically each episode is an academic lecture from a highprofile academic or public figure.New Books in Public Policy each episode is an interview with the author of a new book that relates to politics or some sort of public policy issue.Notebook on Cities and Culture can be fairly interesting although I pick and choose the episodes I listen to based on cities Im familiar with or interested in.  Basically hell go to a city and interview about  somewhatprominent people there each of whom gets their own episode and they discuss the city from their perspective.  So for Vancouver for example he interviewed a local comedian a novelist a writer an English professor and a former city councillor Gordon Price who spoke about city planning and the freeway plan that was defeated in the s my favourite episode Ive heard.Stuff You Should Know is a little lighter but still informative basically for each episode these two guys research and explain a random topic for the audience including everything from Animal Domestication to Socialism to Panic Attacks to The Great Train Robbery.  Its great for getting a basic understanding about various topics you dont know much about.If theres any film buffs here Id recommend Battleship Pretension.

If you have for example a mechanics shop a grocery store most retail then it works better since theres not much in the way of disparity between factions of workers. It falls down however when you get into more complicated areas. How does one structure a workers coop for an automotive manufacturer for example? How do you resolve disputes between the engineering  design staff the logistics people and the assembly line workers about who should be getting paid what and why? In the end you tend to get the same issues as youll have with traditional union  management systems except the various unions will be doing more of their own bickering amongst themselves. For an example of how that can go really wrong have a look at what happened to United Airlines. In  they enacted a deal whereby the unions representing the workers would be given a  share of the company essentially putting them in control. This still however didnt manage to solve their labour issues because the factions in that group werent cooperating. They have strikes things otherwise werent running smoothly. Then  came and gave the entire industry a hit and United due to these issues wasnt able to survive intact.

It was the result of the confluence of nationalism weak internal trade a shift from manufacturing to servicebased production a weak US economic outlook instability in global buying etc.Since then Canadas debttoGDP ratio has fallen. Our servicessector leads the world we have one of the most stable currencies a market cap on the TMX over  trillion and have seen unprecedented growth over the last  years. Canada today is nothing like Canada of the s.Moreover the world is a different place. The worlds biggest economies France Germany Russia China and Japan are all either in recession about to be in recession or heading for a depression. Italy will need some form of aid its a matter of when. The UK and Australia have seen growth predictions slashed to zero. The EU is mulling new options for employment growth and debt management as the Eurozone is in a very poor state. China is telling the world not to worry about its economic problems sending a shockwave of investor panic that has hit Saigon and Sydney particularly hard. So why hasnt Canada fallen? The US is posting record growth. Canadas fundamentals are strong we have a high labour force participation an unemployment rate when adjusted to US calculations of about . Our corporate sector is well financed and has trillions in coffers waiting to move. We weathered the recession strong and are eliminating our budget deficit. Foreign investors whether in Singapore or Paris are signalling their intent to move money and Canada is going to win big. Our government has been out peddling big investment opportunities. Private Equity has been meeting with Canadian investor groups  this is all good news for us. Like it or not the news that we eliminated our budget deficit while France wont fall below the EU threshold until  speaks to investors. They want a guaranteed ROI and investing where the governments may need to increase taxes or make significant market moves over the next  years is not where they want to dump cash.

A negative income tax would be extremely expensive.

You switched between parties based of how they represent their voters so you seem to have a nonpartisan view.Honestly I think I might be getting more biased than Id like since Ive gradually been getting more worried about the prospect of Trudeau being PM as I learn more about him. So that emotional aspect may be warping my perspective. As for Sun News it clearly leans to the right as I am sure you know. I consider it to be an essential source of news as it reports on a number of issues that no other news network covers. However there are a lot of things they dont cover which other networks do. And sometimes they tend to cherry pick facts or omit certain things on a story which gives misleading impressions. An example would be their coverage of how each party is doing in the polls. They often only report the stats that make Harper look more popular than he actually is and omit stats that show Trudeau ahead. That said a lot of their cherry picked stats are also stats that dont get mentioned on networks like the CBC.

Upgrading rail capacity in the prairies could be beneficial as between increased oil traffic and large wheat crops the rail lines havent been able to keep up. My reasons for including city infrastructure are. Cities have limited taxation and often need to rely on other levels of government to partially fund major infrastructure projects. Toronto is unable to fund its current transit expansion plan and will have to get provincial and possibly federal funds.. The vast majority of GDP in Canada is generated in a few comparatively small urban areas Toronto Montreal and Calgary alone represent more than a third of GDP. Half of all manufactured products are done so in Toronto and the surrounding area. It benefits Canada as a whole to ensure those cities are functioning as productively as possible which anyone driving along the  can tell you isnt happening. . If the government is smart about what infrastructure it builds by building low carbon mass transit it could benefit all of Canada by reducing harmful carbon emissions.. If money is going to be borrowed for infrastructure spending the feds are in the best position to do so. They have the best credit rating the largest tax base to service the loan.

Cars are expensive to own and operate and support with public infrastructure but we can assume most Canadian commuters are choosing their mode of transportation to maximize their own benefit to the best of their ability. The financial cost of driving is unquestionably high sure but the question is is it too high? For Canadians in cars obviously it isnt because theyre still choosing to drive. Next question is what are the social costs of driving? These are a lot harder to calculate. An even more sticky question are the benefits to drivers worth the externalized costs of it? The author names things like autorelated injury and pollution but if youre really ambitious you get into the time costs of vehicle congestion the overall efficiency of private vehicle use relative to rapid mass transportation which hasnt been properly developed owing to our enthusiastic buyin of the private car and inefficient land uses related to high automobile dependency and development based on an assumption that this dependency will continue.,CanadaPolitics,cnfj2f4,3,t5_2s4gt

2796254,0,t1_cnlt0wn,Hi I notice youre making intimations about the motivations of rapists and I have a few questions.Are you a criminal psychologist? If yes please prove it and Ill be content to accept your claims.If no please source your claims from a reputable source which is to say not from a feminist or womens studies but a criminal psychology one.Because otherwise it sounds like youre just assuming based on... well nothing really. You talk about most men most rapists widespread misogyny but source nothing. I on the other hand happen to have a publication from the RAINNgt In the last few years there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming rape culturefor the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point outthe systemic barriers to addressing the problem it is important to not lose sight of a simplefact Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions of a smallpercentage of the community to commit a violent crime.gt While that may seem an obvious point it has tended to get lost in recent debates. This hasled to an inclination to focus on particular segments of the student population e.g.athletes particular aspects of campus culture e.g. the Greek system or traits that arecommon in many millions of lawabiding Americans e.g. masculinity rather than on thesubpopulation at fault those who choose to commit rape. This trend has the paradoxicaleffect of making it harder to stop sexual violence since it removes the focus from theindividual at fault and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions. As for lacking in prevention messages?gt By the time they reach college most students have been exposed to  years of preventionmessages in one form or another. Thanks to repeated messages from parents religiousleaders teachers coaches the media and yes the culture at large the overwhelmingmajority of these young adults have learned right from wrong and enter college knowingthat rape falls squarely in the latter category. As for whether or not messages are effective or lacking?gt There is no shortage of campaigns designed to deliver antisexual violence awareness andprevention to collegeaged students and other members of the community. While many ofthese programs seem promising research to date is insufficient to allow us to know howeffective they are or to identify bestinclass programs. There is also insufficient research toknow if onesize messages work or if and how they should be tailored for audiences suchas male or LGBT survivors or those with disabilities. As for the motivations of most rapists?gt Consider as well the findings of another studyiv by Dr. Lisak and colleagues which surveyed male college students and determined that  of them were rapists. Of thosedetermined to be rapists the majority    were repeat offenders who admitted tocommitting multiple sexual assaults.v Overall they found that each offender committed anaverage of . sexual assaults.vi Again this research supports the fact that more than  ofcollegeage males do not and are unlikely to ever rape.

Because you dont have to think very hard about it to realize its just plain stupid.First of all any human system is going to have a certain level of error built in. So if we take the statement in the spirit in which it is intended we wouldnt have a justice system at all. Anarchy prevails!Second some basic math shows how undesirable it would be to take the statement literally. Assume eleven people ten guilty of murder and one falsely accused. Let us further assume a recidivism rate of oh say only twenty percent. So we can execute so were comparing death to death  life in prison would actually make convicting them all even more reasonable all of them and one innocent person will die. Or we can let them all go and two innocent people will die.And thats assuming a recidivism rate of only . The recidivism rate is a matter of some debate depending upon how its measured. However  seems about right. The rate for violent crime is considerably lower  but thats likely because those convicted are punished fairly severely. Here they arent being punished at all and so would presumably reoffend at the usual rate.Moreover not all recidivists will be caught the second they reoffend. Some might commit multiple reoffenses before being brought again to justice.So now Blackstones statement becomes essentially it is better to let four innocent men die than for one innocent man to spend twenty years in jail. You dont have to be a utilitarian to see the problem with that calculus. Any rational citizen should object based on an understanding of odds.,CanadaPolitics,co2iat1,1,t5_2s4gt
2943369,0,t1_co2kfmu,Im a little concerned that I have misled you a bit...Over the years I have linked two different Elections Canada resources in discussions related to electoral reform andor voter turnout and similar.One of them is indeed a survey where EC has surveyed voters and nonvoters in an attempt to quantify the actual reasons why people do this or dont do that or whatever.  I accept that there could be problems with the information gleaned from such a survey and that we should be cautious about drawing conclusions especially cautious about making momentous changes in response.  OTOH I do trust that EC survey data more than I trust a statement such as ...its a sign that most people dont think that there is a need to vote.The other resource is not a survey at least not a survey in the sense of speaking to a sample of voters and asking about possible future behaviours  instead it is an academic study that attempts to correlate various factors around elections such as PR compulsory voting ease of voting etc etc to voter turnout while controlling for the other variables.  In that study it was noted that compulsory voting laws increase turnout a lot PR systems tend to increase turnout by  to  and most other measures have little to no correlation with turnout.

I dont exactly know what the Australian PM said to the Egyptian President but he was unconditionally released I dont think he forfeited his passport but I could be wrong.Meanwhile Canada issued a weakly worded statement in June and only raised the profile of the case because of domestic pressure. If Harper and Baird had taken a stronger public stance on Fahmys case from the beginning perhaps the Egyptian President would have released him with Peter Greste. Instead Egypt saw that Greste would not stand trial for the crime he was convicted of in Egypt and decided to hold off on releasing Fahmy. ,CanadaPolitics,conbuss,1,t5_2s4gt

As soon as someone is publicly pulled off the floor of the stock exchange or from behind the counter at the local diner the fallout is inherently prejudicial to the suspect.Id also say that due to the larger ethical responsibility that the Law Society puts on lawyers and paralegals the fiduciary duty to clients and the larger duty to society that this not only taints Ms. Liscio but the profession as a whole in a way that doesnt affect other professions.

But if your lawyer or paralegal refuses to interface with your family when youre in pretrial custody this is why. It negatively affects a third partys constitutional rights and thus leads us down a chilling path between defense parties and defense lawyersparalegals. gtMy point in making these statements and asking these questions is to point out that this is something that happens on a very regular basis and regardless of the employer or place of work there are negative consequences even when suspects are acquitted. Why should lawyers be sheltered from that when others are not?Because Lawyers are currently part of the machinations of justice.

Through the Canada Health Act several principles and provisions are in place that the provinces must meet in order to receive the full amount of the Canada Health Transfer a block grant by the federal government to provinces that is used to fund health care. In order to have something like pharmacare implemented across Canada in provincial plans it would typically take a federal initiative and funding to make it happen. The absence of pharmacare within provincial health insurance systems is a testament to this with limited implementation in most provinces. Quebec is a province where everyone must have pharmacare whether through a private insurer or public coverage.

3240997,0,t3_2x8ric,These are the things that are going to happen Governor General Johnstons term is up in October its possible Harper could extend his term by a year its not unheard of but its also possible he could appoint a new one before dissolving Parliament for the next election. If its a new one there will be some interesting implications from that. General Election The only real leader at risk here is Harper. Anything short of another majority and therell be a growing push for him to finally take that last walk out in the snow. Trudeau can only improve the Liberals from where they are so hes safe. Mulcair may get some grumbling especially if the NDP loses Official Opposition status but the federal NDP has never been quick to cannibalize their leaders so hell get at least another election to turn things around.  Election Issues With oil tanking the Cons will pivot to keep terrorism and security the main talking point its also good for them since the Liberals have ceded this point by supporting C. Liberals will likely take the tact of its time for change and trying to underscore the personality difference between Harper and Trudeau. Mulcair will stick close to third option talking points the NDP has traditionally used and Im sure Trudeaus voting record in the House will be used ala Ignatieffs attendance records. The Debates Whether or not the third parties are included the debates are going to be interesting. Harper and team are musing wanting more than two for the sake of embarrassing Trudeau by forcing him into a gaffe but many expect that to be the wrong play. Personally I think both sides are underestimating Mulcair weve seen him perform in the House and I think hell be formidable in a debate but I could be biased on that point and more debates are likely to favour Mulcair over anyone else.If May Fortin Beaulieu are excluded from the debates there could be some fallout. The Greens have been in this position before and it hasnt provided political hay for them but it might give them the momentum to actually capture that elusive second seat theyve been polling towards.Excluding the Quebec parties is especially problematic since the Bloc will use it to whip up separatist rage and Francophobia by seeing a French language debate where two Quebec parties were excluded. Whether it actually translates to votes is another thing. Election Result Yeah no idea on this one. The additional  ridings gives a small edge to the Conservatives since they can lose seats they have now and make them up in some  of the new ridings. We are likely heading towards a minority government but who will get the first chance to govern is really anyones guess. Quebecs polls change almost daily and it seems every party with the possible exception of Forces amp Democracy seem to be in play.Ontario and BC will also have a major role to play in determining who forms government but it really is a guess.Either way should be very interesting to watch this campaign play out.,CanadaPolitics,coxxq2l,12,t5_2s4gt

While Im sure some will want to revoke my membership to the Real Progressives club and forcibly remove the secret tattoo with a cheesegrater I do agree with you that inflicting what amounts to violent coercion is sometimes necessary  or at least probably a good idea. That said the fact that we had to have this backandforth helping to establish that were talking not about torture or enhanced interrogation techniques but aggressive interrogation techniques ought to say something important about how the modern war on terror has managed to muddy what would otherwise be universal horror at the treatment of those detained and... interrogated without the nicety of anything a public arrest normal judicial procedure or an open fair trial. The prospect of this being levied on fellow humans who were sure are involved in an active plot to hurt Canadians or Canadian institutions is unpleasant but ultimately palatable the prospect of this being levied on someone merely involved in say a protest movement is IMO overmasteringly horrible. YMMV. The point Im trying to make here is that were actually a free society.

But what people are suggesting when this comes up is that they have created these other issues to distract us from the economy rather than as a matter of political opportunism. Yet of the issues raised in the comment I replied to terrorism niqab crime  only one can be said to have been artificially inserted into the debate. Otherwise its been external factors that have led the discourse  particularly in the case of the niqab. I dont consider the emphasis on issues which benefit them to be cynical.  What is cynical is that  the Conservatives alone do this  that it is their plan  that it is successful. Instead I would argue that all parties try to shape discourse as you suggest that on these particularly issues the Conservatives have generally not artificially affected discourse to focus on something other than the economy if anything its the other parties and that regardless nobody has forgotten about the economy. If the only wrongdoing here is that the Conservatives are talking about things other than the economy  rds of which were raised primarily by their opponents  then there is hardly proof of a plan to distract Canadians from the real issues.

Given that the bill doesnt actually do either of these things to begin with but that those saying it does dont seem to care how do you counter that view?What the bill does do is allow security agencies to share information which is obviously a good thing in terms of making sure a threat isnt missed. It also criminalizes terrorist advocacy in much the same way that various forms of hate speech are already criminalized which is hardly a major shift in the Canadian legal landscape. It permits CSIS to detain terror suspects when it thinks that doing so would disrupt a terrorist plot which given that weve recently had attacks carried about by people flagged as threats but allowed to roam free because the law permitted nothing else doesnt exactly seem unreasonable.  ,CanadaPolitics,cpv0dkp,-4,t5_2s4gt

And predictions have been wrong before.  According to some predictions by some very smart people we were suppose to have mass global starvation and dieoff as population growth outstripped food supply decades ago.It didnt happen because predictions are never guaranteed.By contrast if you plan to create to reduce wealth you will succeed in reducing wealth.The reason I favour a simple carbon tax like British Columbia has over Ms. Kleins social utopianism or the geoengineering peoples technoutopianism is that price pressures have repeatedly worked to find technological solutions to complex problems.Maybe wealth loss steep ongoing recession and permanent wealth stagnation are inevitable.  Or maybe not and technological change will present new opportunities.  Price pressures are a great way to find out.More to the point none of this makes Ms. Kleins prediction any more plausible that people will repeatedly willingly vote for massive wealth redistribution while all this is apparently going on.People are generally loath to give away additional wealth when their wealth is already being reduced.  As Mr. Heath pointed out its no accident that the modern welfare state was built while phenomenal economic growth was taking place.  Ask man who just got a big raise if hed like to forgo just a small part of the raise and give it to other people and youre a lot more likely to get an affirmative answer than if you ask a man who just got a massive pay cut if hed like to give even more money away to someone else.,CanadaPolitics,cq369tx,6,t5_2s4gt

A grassroots movement of Aboriginal Canadians organizing to improve their situation was compared to bacteria. If I was part of that movement Id be offended. If you were a part of something that authority figures compared to bacteria what would your immediate reaction be?gtBut the report said nothing of the sort it was merely pointing out that the movement was growing and spreading and the obvious analogies for something which grows and spreads on its own are bacteria and mold.I think the biggest thing is that the analogy was simply not needed. Why should it have been included? From your quotegtlike bacteria it has grown a life of its ownAbsolutely nothing is lost by removing like bacteria. Instead it was included. Whether intended or not the use of that term and that comparison elicit a response. People generally speaking dont use bacteria as a comparison to things they like or support. The comparison added nothing except adding a negative connotation to the movement.

A major effort should be undertaken to make the peoples of the Western countries understand why rearmament and alliance are an important and unavoidable part of the Western response to the type of political warfare conducted by the Soviet Union. This means that we must not seem to assume in our statements as we often do that the Soviet Union is probably planning to attack the West although we must never wholly exclude this possibility and we must make people understand why rearmament is nevertheless required. At the same time we must be careful to emphasize that it is only part of the answer and can actually be disruptive of the total pattern of Western resistance if it is not balanced by many other factors such as economic health and political confidence and the belief in and hope for a peaceful future. To the extent that this can be doneto the extent that is that rearmament and alliance can be portrayed simply as safeguards of something peaceful and constructive for which we still confidently hope rather than just as preparations for a war to which we have resigned ourselves hopelesslythe peace card will be struck from the Soviet hand and Soviet success in the political war will be reduced.gt . A given pattern of military preparations always appears to the public as the reflection of a given pattern of calculations and intentions. It is important that the building of the NATO structure appear to reflect not the feverish preparations of people who regard war as inevitable and are working against a limit of time but the calm and judicious measures of people simply building a fence not in the belief that someone else is likely to try to knock it down but rather in the normal and prudent desire to have clarity on all sides and to prevent any and all misunderstandings. Such a view must inevitably have certain disadvantages from the standpoint of the achievement at the earliest possible moment of the ideal military posture. But it must be accepted and remembered that there is an incurable conflict in certain respects between the goal of the ideal military posture and the goal of winning the political wara war which is still in progress and which we have no choice but to continue to fight. The requirements of either of these approaches the military or the political wouldif carried to extremesbe quite destructive of the requirements of the other. But neither could be successful if the other were fully destroyed. If problems were to be faced only from the political standpoint the degree of actual military preparation that would ensue would be quite inadequate for purposes of a war if one were actually to occur. On the other hand if the professional military planner were to be given all that he desired from the standpoint of the preparation of an adequate military posture against Soviet power the results would probably be quite disruptive of the political resistance of the Western peoples.gt What we are faced with therefore is the need for a reasonable and sensible compromise between these two requirements and it seems to me we would find it at approximately that point where Western rearmament would appear to the uninitiated public as the reflection of firm and reasonable precaution against misunderstandings or accident or ill will but not as the reflection of a hopeless commitment to the dynamics of an arms race What we must avoid is to appear fascinated and enmeshed by the relentless and deceptive logic of the military equation. What people need to be shown is that we are the masters not the slaves of the process of military and political tension.gt . NATO community should bear in mind that the Soviet leaders are extremely curious people in whose minds there are areas of what we might call rationality but other areas that are quite irrational. They have shown restraint on several occasions and have exhibited no recent signs of an actual desire for an armed conflict. But they are secretive and often erratic in their reactions and it is not easy to tell when you are going to touch one of the neuralgic and irrational points. They are plainly sensitive about the frontiers of their power and particularly such frontiers as can be approached by sea. They are also quite naturally sensitive about being surrounded by a ring of air bases plainly grouped with a view to penetration of their own territory.gt Obviously there is no clear line between the offensive and the defensive in military considerations. Many of our defensive measures must appear offensively motivated to the Russians. Equally obviously we cannot let that be a reason for paralyzing our entire effort at an adequate Western defense posture. But here again le mieux est lennemi du bien. Surely as one moves ones bases and military facilities toward the Soviet frontiers there comes a point where they tend to create the very thing they were designed to avoid. It is not for us toassume that there are no limits to Soviet patience in the face of encirclement by American bases. Quite aside from political considerations no great country peaceful or aggressive rational or irrational could sit by and witness with indifference the progressive studding of its own frontiers with the military installations of a greatpower competitor. Here again a compromise must be struck and one which will inevitably fall somewhat short of the military ideal. This compromise must be struck with a view to the peculiarities of Russian mentality and tradition. We must remember that almost the only language in which we can now communicate with the Soviet leaders is the language of overt military and political moves.If youre interested in an analysis of Russian expansionism at a time when the Soviet Union was at the height of its power Id recommend reading the whole thing.,CanadaPolitics,cro2c9w,1,t5_2s4gt

Therefore there really was more of a focus on local candidates and much less focus on the potential PMs and party discipline and all of that.Also it is my perception that once MPs got to Ottawa in the past the role of the party was less than it is today and the inner workings of government were less open to scrutiny back in the ridings.  IIRC it was not unusual for members of different parties to share apartments making it more common for an understanding of the other point of view to develop but not so much these days.Bottom line is that a person might be able to convince me that in the past FPTP delivered adequate results that MPs did represent all of their constituents as much as possible and that there was a more collegial work atmosphere.

4458414,1,t1_cssig00,In general when the government subsidizes something you get more of it. So if the government subsidizes poverty youll get more poverty everything else being equal. The governments war on poverty is as effective as their war on drugs or their war on terror. Also we basically already have a guaranteed minimum income... its call welfare and there are a variety of welfare programs that provide money goods and services to poor people that didnt pay for any of it. GMI people are basically just advocating for super welfare.Who knows how much this will all cost. The left always claims that just little more money will solve the problem but its never enough. Theyve been fighting this war on poverty for decades and spent god knows how much money... and where are we? And whenever the government makes estimates about how much something will cost... they almost always dramatically underestimate. And if we do end up giving poor people a bunch of cash every month... what happens when some of them spend it all on drugs alcohol gambling etc.?The only way the government can pay people money for free is if they take that money from someone else who earned that money in the free market. And remember you get less of what you tax and more of what you subsidize. So if you tax hard work and subsidize poverty youll get less people working hard and more people in poverty. Thats why government programs such as this often have the opposite outcome than what they were trying to accomplish.But in any case... this GMI nonsense is basically just promoted by big government socialistscommunists who are pretty much clueless when it comes to economics. They see a problem and they want to expand the role of government to solve it. In many cases people are poor because of the government. Maybe they have a criminal record because of some bogus drug charge or bogus police charge. Now they cant get a good job because of their record. Now they need the government to pay them welfareGMI. But if the government didnt screw them over in the first place they wouldnt need the government to take care of them. A lot of people advocate for affordable housing... but they forget that its the governments central bank who blew up the housing bubble with low interest rates and guaranteed mortgages through the CMHC. The government made housing artificially expensive... so now everyone wants the government to subsidize housing so that people can afford it because its too expensive. Basically the government has screwed up the economy with their biggovernment socialist policies... as a result a lot of people are poor... so now the poor people want the government to save them even though its the government who is making them poor in the first place. If the government tries to end poverty with a GMI... they will likely create more poverty instead. Its all part of the slow transition to a failed socialist state. ,CanadaPolitics,cssnwwi,0,t5_2s4gt

Do you mean the tax avoidance with CCPCs? That is more an issue with CCPCs being abused than a small business tax cut.Your last sentence doesnt make any sense to me.  The tax cuts are separate from how business owners use income splitting  Mulcair is not ending that policy and this effectively means that business owners now get a business tax cut and they get to keep splitting their income while the poor and middle class get almost nothing from him... just subsidized daycare which is also used disproportionately by wealthier families.Im sorry these are just not progressive policies.

4569554,0,t1_ct6ksrw,gt Are you assuming hourly rather than salaried wages? Asking because I can see how an hourly wage that is identical regardless of gender could amount to less for one person compared to another if the number of hours they work is different. Meh even if youre talking salaried positions the amount of time you spend at work will heavily come into play when it comes time for promotions. The person that hustles and burns the midnight oil is more likely to be rewarded with a promotion than the person that has to leave on the dot in order to pick the kids up from school  day care etc. And unfortunately the latter person is more likely to be a woman than a man in most households. gt That said its illogical to accept that women should make less because they miss more time at work than do men. A growing number of households have women as the sole bread winner. To accept that as a society were ok with these households having less income because the breadwinner is a woman is to systematically disadvantage both the woman and everyone in that household. Women dont procreate all on their own. Society benefits from bringing children into the world and nurturing them into adulthood. Its illogical to accept that women and any dependants they may have would bear the full financial burden through lower income. Well when were getting to this it probably more works the other way. If you have a dual parent household with the woman as the sole earner thats most likely to be the case because she has a higher earning potential than her husband. So a lot of that stuff that leads women to not succeed as much at work isnt a factor or at least not as much of a factor because the husband is the one who is primarily in charge of taking care of the kids.As you said this is becoming increasingly common which shouldnt be all that surprising what with women also being the ones most likely to pursuit higher educations nowadays. Hopefully we can see this trend continuing with more and more households making their child care decisions based upon something other than antiquated traditional gender roles. ,CanadaPolitics,ct6lr5l,3,t5_2s4gt

They all arrived here with little to no money its work ethic that creates a successful business not money.

I wonder if the purchasing of some Fs would be possible if our budget increased to the target  GDP though which I think we should be striving to meet. The other question is if we were to transition to Rolstons model what place would Fs have? Because as I understand it the F purchase is our way to further commit ourselves to NATO gives us access to a lot of the infrastructure that the US has committed to the project which I believe dwarfs our ENTIRE defense budget and allows us to participate in joint NATO training exercises. How much would we be losing out if we DONT purchase the Fs?The other thing is that arctic sovereignty doesnt really come up and I think that is probably just because the article is dated and arctic sovereignty has really only become an issue in the last decade.

This area of law is concerned with the actions of administrative decision makers like the teachers college and the law society. These ADMs can only do what they are told to by the legislature through their enabling legislation their home statute. Judicial review of administrative decisions is at its heart statutory interpretation to see if the ADM reasonably interpreted their home statute to do what they did. Hopefully having made that clear why would the soundness of one ADMs decison affect another even if the applicant for judicial review is the same? Can you see how that would be the really odd thing if it happened?  What happened in TWU was that the SCC approved the trial judges ruling that the teachers college improperly interpreted their home statute they claimed to have a responsibility to protect the public interest when no provision in it gave them such a responsibility.

There was a lot of wrangling back and forth over this with the programme that Parliament and the provinces approved looking a lot different from what was announced but neither level of government was really happy with what was produced.If provinces want to opt out that will kick off a lot of strong arming from both sides until something gets worked out but I believe that in principle they can opt out they just have to be willing to pay the price of exercising that right.,CanadaPolitics,cv12p9y,2,t5_2s4gt

In a recession mild or otherwise when interest rates are historically low and highly unlikely to rise significantly anytime soon not considering running a deficitif responsible jobcreating investments are availableis financially irresponsible and reckless. The time to borrow money and invest in projects with  to  year life spans is when a nation is in recession or economically stagnating when money is very cheap and when employment rates are low or of low quality.I understand that touting balanced budgets and surpluses may be good politics during an election but they are often bad public policy.,CanadaPolitics,cv2hu8g,6,t5_2s4gt

Especially those raised in Canada. gt The niqab is designed to keep women submissive. I dont believe that Canada should allow this.I think this is historically accurate but it seems many Muslim women feel its a choice and part of their identity.  However more importantly  I dont know why you would entrust the state to make such determinations and enforce them through threat of penalty.  I dont believe its the role of the state to make this choice for people.  You can say but its not a real choice because it is made through duress but thats ultimately a factspecific conclusion based on the personal circumstances of a particular individual.

5191999,0,t1_cvbt87x,Well its an election the parties dont have time for nuance about academic articles...As for Milligans paper directly theres a few things I would mention that lend credibility to not taking the paper as it stands at face value at least at the present moment. Firstly another academic has challenged some of the methodology used by Milligan in the paper specifically in terms of using eligible for as attended for the data meaning that the report includes looking at children who never attended day care in Quebec.Secondly this is working paper which means it isnt peer reviewed. The National Bureau of Economic Research which is where the paper comes from has this to say about working papersgt NBER Working Papers have not undergone the review accorded official NBER publications in particular they have not been submitted for approval by the Board of directors. They are intended to make results of NBER research available to other economists in preliminary form to encourage discussion and suggestions for revision before publication.So effectively the data isnt set in stone and still needs to be reviewed by fellow academics before it can be considered gospel in terms of the outcomes of a child care program. The problem is opponents of a child care program are holding up the paper as proof that the program doesnt work or is a negative in the long run. But this is coming from an unfinished paper or essentially a first draft if you will that can and will be changed as it is reviewed and debated by fellow academics. I think the status of it as a working paper is definitely a valid criticism of the report in its current form especially for those who are saying it is the beallendall measure of proof for the ineffectiveness of a child care program. I wish the NDP focused on this fact as opposed simply tying Milligan to Trudeau but for a soundbite in an election Its an academic working paper isnt as effective as The author has liberal ties.

5207769,0,t1_cvdf915,gt Last year and so far this year.   which has been known for what  days now.  The government doesnt get to declare a surplus until the fiscal year is done.  Which was only a few months ago.  As far as this year goes there is a surplus?  seeing how all the raiding and assets that had to be sold to get a surplus last year what are they selling this year in order to have a surplus?  Plus the guy who is telling this tale cant even recognize his own governments definition of a recession.  So when you cant even admit the obvious easy stuff why should you be believed on something that is massive and complex?    gtWhat? What does that even mean? How do you raid EI?    Well when you have an EI fund that is supposed to be kept separate from general revenues and you take a few billion from that fund you are indeed raiding it.  That money needs to have been returned to the rate payers in form of reduced premiums or increased benefits or eligibility.  You take your choice but it should not be put into general revenues to create a fake surplus.     gtThats false there was no borrowing last year.    Oh but we did borrow last year that is what raiding EI funds and selling off assets is.  You wouldnt consider selling off your car or raiding your kids college fund as an increase in your income would you?   gtnot provide benefits due     Ok for one example you close  veterans affairs offices.  This decreases a veterans ability to interact with the department and makes it harder for them to obtain their benefits due.  I personally am bothered by this greatly as the price they paid and the services they deserve are really not negotiable to me.  Personal disclosure I do have family in the military and know some of the shit they have went through for Canada.    gtFederal budget records show that since  veterans affairs was unable to spend . billion of its budget money that was subsequently returned to the federal treasury.from this article     Its kind of like declaring yourself in the black when you dont pay your child support for  months of the year.    gt Thats false there was no borrowing last year.    Well when you sell assets raid EI funds take from the contingency fund and dont pay out benefits due you are borrowing.  Perhaps not in the traditional sense but at sometime much of that has to be paid back.gtIf I cared more Harper would be the best bet since he initiated the senate investigation and fired Wright when he learned about the scandal. This is in stark contrast to the NDP and Liberal scandals which involved the entire parties.   Harper created the scandal by appointing douchebags to the senate then threw them under the bus when the optics looked bad for him.  Do tell what NDP and Liberal scandals involved the whole party?  Nobody is insinuating that the entire CPC party is responsible for Harpers misdoings so why the large brush for the other parties?  We had Gomery which put blame where it was due.  The NDP will have their day in court and the government wont prevail pretty much like they do every other time they go to court.   As for Harpers future he will be able to cash in rather quickly in the oil sands well so long as they are able to keep running which is questionable.

5237398,0,t1_cvh9d05,Ah I get what you were saying now with regards to spending.The reason I was using spending as a percentage of GDP was because in an alliance especially when it stipulates a certain goal percentage the best metric for comparison as to whether there is an equal and equitable amount of burdensharing going on is to compare across percentage of GDP. No one expects Belgium to put in as much as the US in actual dollars but it is fair to expect that it will devote a certain amount of its budget to do its fair share based on its capabilities.Now with regards to the threat of Russia itself it is a rather facile to simply look at the threat as being a direct headtohead engagement where the Russians flood into the Eastern European countries with the intent to stop only when they hit Lisbon and whatnot. However thats not a realistic scenario for a bunch of reasons including the asymmetry between NATO and Russia military capabilities and the existence of nuclear weapons. The realistic scenarios that those of us who study international security and international relations centre around Russias desire to establish a sphere of influence over Eastern and to some extent Central Europe that it perceives as historically belonging to Russia. It has been doing this primarily through the use of little green men and through frozen conflicts. For these Eastern European memberstates of NATO this is perceived as a very real threat as evidenced by Russias involvement in Georgia and more recently Ukraine.Furthermore the Eastern European memberstates are worried about the actual willingness of their allies in NATO to actually back them up if a similar situation to Ukraine would occur. There are very big question marks about whether NATO would. This poses serious questions about whether NATO could continue to exist if it is actual faced with this situation. At its core it is a defence agreement and if some members are unwilling to actually follow through on the treaty then why should anyone put trust in it to actually protect them?So thats a problem that NATO is facing right now because of Russia. If Canada does not spend money on its military it signals that it is not concerned with contributing to the collective defence of the memberstates.On top of this Canada must contribute to continental security in North America. The primary foreign policy concern in USCanada relations for the US is security. They are worried about Russians over the Arctic and terrorists and migrants crossing the border. For Canada our primary concern is trade with the US. The US knows this and can and does leverage that against us. If they feel we are not pulling our weight on the security front they punish us for it economically because they can afford it and their priority is ensuring security for the US. We cannot afford it and therefore we must contribute.Also worth keeping in mind that the Canadian Forces are operating on a bare bones budget right now with a lot of capabilities being drastically affected in a very negative way. To further cut spending to the Canadian Forces will cause us to likely lose many capabilities that if we ever wanted to bring back would cost us an enormous amount.Your comment about us being completely safe and you not being happy with the wars weve been fighting are unfair in my opinion. A very basic facet of being safe comes from having a military that deters the use of force against your state. By spending less on our military especially given its current state you are only increasing our insecurity. Also you can be opposed to our war efforts if you want but at the end of the day we still need a military and we need to pay the bills to ensure it can do its job if we need it.

In one extreme case federal revenues might be limited to just that needed to cover enforcement of the revised laws on production with the actual revenueextracting going to provincial coffers much as is done with alcohol.In light of this ambiguity in the name of prudence and not being roasted by pundits the LPC is not booking any projected revenue from marijuana taxation into its platform.,CanadaPolitics,cvozuzi,14,t5_2s4gt

Given that the whole justification of electoral reform is that FPTP gives a parliament that doesnt necessarily reflect what voters want I find it weird that a supermajority in this supposedly flawed house is acceptable.  I mean if a big majority in the house reflects the will of voters then the whole reasoning behind FPTP being unacceptable falls apart.  Oh well thanks for the answer.   I have to say though it certainly looks an awful lot like the Greens are pushing a system for their own partisan benefit and the will of voters is secondary.  After all...

The nonindexed limit suggests that the contribution limit wont be touched for a long time. The taxes from the earnings within the TFSA are sheltered from the CRA but dont forget that the contributed amounts are already taxed. The intent of the TFSA isnt for daily use but for longterm read retirement savings. Its a social policy tool to promote individuals taking responsibility for their own retirement which in my opinion is great  eliminating the TFSA reduces an incentive to save for your own retirement.,CanadaPolitics,cvtl7dg,3,t5_2s4gt

Its interesting but the Conservatives have never polled below  in recent memory even when McLellan won. Theres definitely more condos downtown with younger professionals than last election but still it will be interesting to see if they vote and for whom they vote from the young professionals I know Liberal seems to be a common choice.IMO the conservative stands an excellent chance of being elected due to vote split to the left. Randy Boissonnault has been campaigning hard for over a year however the NDP nomination was last minute after the writ dropped which is disappointed to me because NDP candidate last election Lewis Cardinal whom also campaigned hard stepped down for health reasons . years ago with no NDP candidate taking up the reins.

IIRC four people who we turned away did not come back to our pollbox. Though its possible that they came back and were referred to a different box once they had the right address. A surprising number of people did not have the correct address on their photo IDdrivers license.One fellow arrived with his wife without proof of address right in the thick of the postwork rushjust before pm. She had proof of address and was able to vote. I asked him to go get the form that allows his wife to swear that they share address so he could vote too. I told him that it would probably take less than five minutes and that it would allow him to vote. He grumbled about how he didnt want to wait anymore and stormed out. His wife followed. They didnt come back. I thanked the next voter for their patience and asked how long they had been waiting from the time they arrived at the community centre to the time they got to me and they said almost fifteen minutes which was the longest wait we had all day.,CanadaPolitics,cw69j44,32,t5_2s4gt

MMP involves a mix of some members being elected in local ridings in our current manner of election with other MPs being chosen from lists on the basis of a partys share of the popular vote. Thats why its called a mixedmember system.As others have said unless provinces are willing to hold Senate elections to recommend persons for appointment to the Senate by the PM and they are mostly not so willing then implementing an election method for the Senate at the federal level would require a constitutional amendment.

5550432,0,t3_3r4wsw,A lot of interesting things in that poll.Who was responsible for making all the conservative TV ads? Whoever it is doesnt seem to have done a good job. Its like conservatives were paying money to make soft or accessible voters less likely to vote for them. Look at how separated conservative ID voters are from the liberalsNDPunaligned. Everything that boosts conservative votes reduces votes from the other  groups and vice versa.Except sharing niqab with the bloc and home reno with unaligned.  On the other hand there were things both liberals and NDP liked so they arent quite as separated. Do the conservatives have a big problem that they couldnt reach unaligned voters with anything except that one tax credit getting plus ?Trudeaus debate and campaign performance helped him far more than the other leaders. Was he really so much better at it or was he just benefiting from exceeding the lowered expectations?  That liberal income tax plan was a real vote getter from NDPblocunaligned. NDP probably made a huge mistake promising not to touch income taxes. I wonder if it would have helped the NDP to just copy the liberals income tax plan after they announced it. Changing FPTP was also a net plus for the liberals. That probably increases the chance they will follow through on that. It also might be used to justify changing it without a referendum since it was something voters noticed and approved of not something people voted liberal without knowing about and not that they voted liberal because of other things while disapproving of that one policy . I wonder why they didnt ask about marijuana legalization and what numbers that would have gotten. Liberal and unaligned didnt like NDP rejecting the TPP deal but they didnt approve of the conservatives for signing it either. Anybody know why that could be? It looks like poll numbers did hurt NDP votes and helped liberal votes but I think it is interesting NDP voters didnt admit to letting liberal poll numbers make it more likely to vote for them. Niqab getting a positive number from NDPs softaccessible support does contradict the narrative that their position on that is what dealt the fatal blow to their campaign. Liberals were plus  to their own party for not raising corporate taxes every other party had weak disapproval even conservatives with . Liberals were plus  to the NDP for promising to raise corporate taxes conservatives were  bloc  unaligned . So this policy helped the NDP but not nearly as much as income tax helped the liberals. Imagine if one party was smart enough to promise both tax changes at the same time. Though liberals and conservatives seem contradictory here in if they supportoppose an increase or not.Kory Teneycke must be shocked that Ford derangement syndrome has spread to so many people. Wanting to vote for Harper less because he was with Rob Ford was the only thing that all the party supporters were united in. Conservatives sacrificed  among their softaccessible support just to gain  from their core with that move. But how could anybody in the CPC campaign have possibly predicted that the completely normal event of Harper campaigning with Ford would have reduced their votes? Nobody could have seen that coming. ,CanadaPolitics,cwl2zay,10,t5_2s4gt

5739678,0,t1_cx8jk8u,Why the F is the best fighter currently in production Price Prices for the F are found from SAR reports. Similar budgeting reports reveal how much other aircraft cost per air frame. Equalizing all these numbers to the same year give you a very good cost comparison. It should give you a chart like this As you can see the FA is the cheapest aircraft currently in production. Here is the Fs  SAR. A more in depth analysis between the Super Hornet and the FA yields these graphs For the FE Then Year USD By Year USD Includes a  million to account for the two engines and Engine Costs the FA I made these charts Then Year USD and By Year USD The FA is less expensive when fuel tanks targeting pods and countermeasures pods are accounted for the Super Hornet. Looking at PAUC the PAUC for an F is  billion    of those are test aircraft  . million.The PAUC for an F is . billion    . million. The PAUC for a Dassault Rafale is . billion    . million. The RAF EF Typhoon . billion    . million.What about cost per flight hour? Well here we can see that it would be about the same as the F.What about total program cost? Well here you can see the program cost style of estimation being applied to the legacy fleet in which case the legacy fleet would cost about  trillion compared to the Fs .. trillion. For a comparison of export purchase with the FE .plane for Australia And here are contracts for the F .plane for Norway .plane for the Netherlands and plane for Australia Keep in mind I have accounted for inflation all are in FY USD. And remember these numbers include more than just the aircraft itself but the purchases are equivalent.  BVR The Fs APG is a direct derivative of the APG. The APG has less transceiver modules but is a little more advanced. Although its impossible to get an actual radar range estimations here and here place it second only to the APG in raw range remember the CAPTORE isnt finished yet. The APG is also the first radar with fully integrated ECM and data links. Its ECM is also said to be the best ever fitted to a fighter im not verifying so take with a grain of salt. As with the APG the APG also has been built to avoid alerting an RWR. One such way the APG do this is by switching radar channels over  times per second. Then we get to stealth. The common stealth estimates for the F are about .. For the F theyre between . and .. However according to Col. Chris Niemi and Maj. Nash Vickers the F is stealthier than the F. Two more quotes about the Fs stealth by General Hostage can be found here and hereSo if we combine the best stealth with the second best radar the F will have the ability to detect an opponent from a long distance and remain undetected until very close in. In short the first warning a bandit will get is when the AIMDs radar or a Meteors becomes active.  WVR The F has a very unique sensor for WVR. Called EODAS. This system allows the pilot to use the aircraft as an enhanced vision system. The Fs EOTS has a much better zoom and range than the human eye. So good it can look into a window from  miles away Further this is combined with DAS to make the EODAS. DAS is built to utilize all sensors identify all possible targets around the aircraft and track all possible targets. DAS will find a bandit far before the pilot is able to detect the bandit. This thus give the F the unique ability to gain and maintain a lock with a missile from anywhere around the aircraft. For turning Im going to pull up some numbers. People like to look at wing loading so lets look at that. Here we see estimates given for the lift produced by the F and F. The F has a maximum of  ft while the F produces  ft. The F weighs   lbs while the F weighs  lbs. This gives an empty liftloading of . lbsft for the F and . lbsft for the F. This means that as long as both aircraft are given the same load the F will always have a lower liftloading than the F.Another important number is the AoA limit. The F is limited to  degrees AoA while the F is limited to  degrees AoA. Another important number is TW. The Fs engine produces  lbf and the F produces  lbf. I gave the empty weights earlier so here are the TW . for the F . for the F. However this doesnt tell the whole story for the TW. Because the F has so little thrust and weighs so little its TW will be disproportionally affected by adding fuel and munitions. So how many lbs of fuelmunitions can be carried by each before they exceed a TW of ?  for the F and  for the F. So how about that document about the F beating the F? Well for starters the F and F were not dogfighting. As found from the report The test was designed to stress the high AoA control laws during operationally representative maneuvers utilizing elevated AoAs and aggressive stickpedal inputs...The Flying Qualities criteria were that the aircraft response would be positive and predictable and that there should be no undesired unexpected or unpredictable aircraft responses. Qualitative observations were made regarding the high AoA capability cues that the aircraft was entering a low energy state as well as various human factors considerations. The F in question was also AF which is not a fully operational air frame. It was built to explore the Fs aerodynamics at high AOA. ...this airframe is designed for flight testing its designed to fly in certain restricted flight envelopes. It does not feature the majority of systems present in frontline aircraft. source Thompson said AF has specific instrumentation and was calibrated for inflight loads measurements... source That second source came out  months before the BFM tests were done. So what were the conclusions in the document Increasing pitch rate and available Nz would provide the pilot more options...Consider increasing alpha onset...Consider increasing the beginning of the blended region to  degrees or greater...Consider increasing pilot yaw rate control authority... Notice a trend with all these? Theyre all related to the control laws also known as software. Fuel The F carries about as much fuel as the F even though the F is larger and heavier than the F. The biggest question about this always comes down to loiter time. So Im going to compare it to the A. The F burns about  more fuel than the A . lbhr x lbf vs. . lbhr x lbf. However the F carries about  more fuel than the A. Yes the F can burn a lot more fuel a lot quicker when needed but why would an F do so when trying to loiter? A lower power setting is always applicable for situations that call for it. Here an article where USAF personel explain that the Fs burned  lbs of fuel each flying  miles from Eglin AFB to Oshkosh Wisconsin. Thus we can calculate the max range in this configuration.     . max fuel  fuel burned. . x   .  miles   km.A chart of fuel burned per hour in certain conditions can be found here Weapons The F can carry a higher weapons load than any other fighter. The F can carry up to  lbs of weapons Compared to  of the A  of the F and  for the FA Super Hornet.  Single vs Duel Engine Modern single engined aircraft have proven to be more reliable than duel engined aircraft. Here is a chart showing engine related mishaps of the modern F F and F.  Also single engined aircraft are well proven in the artic. The F has proven it can operate there as well as a whole host of older aircraft.,CanadaPolitics,cx8ka3x,37,t5_2s4gt

5773503,0,t3_3u7v4n,Ive been thinking about this for a while since the Yale and Mizzou incidents. My thoughts as a nonwhite University student This generation of students is probably the first in which the minorities are not really minorities. It is undeniable that race plays a large part in the social dynamic from the forming of social circles to romantic relationships to simple interactions on the street. The colour of our skin to a large extent guides the paths we take and the decisions we make. Casual racism is still rampant as is flatout disrepect for other cultures what could be called cultural appropriation. I dont think we should be content with this nor do I think it makes for a stable social fabric. It is in my mind the big social issue of my generation doing what has never been done in history and creating a society that can look past race gender and sexuality. Clearly the movement is in its infancy but I would ask that we recognise the issue instead of dismissing it due to a lack of leadership or clear direction.I feel the movements at Yale and Mizzou were not only hamstrung by said lack of leadership and direction but have also been coopted by the vocal minority who do deserve the vitriol and derision that they have received. As an aside Meghan ORourke wrote a piece explaining why the Yale issue is more complicated than it seems  in particular the intricate dualrole that liberal arts colleges are committed to.lite institutions allow inequities to continue without successfully addressing them in turn making resentment build.

5896916,0,t1_cxrvuhc,Personally Im not so worried about having the HoC reflect the national vote.

Similarly the NDP voters in AB are not at all adequately represented by the single NDP MP who happens to hail from Edmonton and LPC voters outside of Edmonton and Calgary have also not received adequate representation.  The NDP and LPC shortfalls in AB were significantly worse in recent elections prior to the  election.If it was difficult to rectify this regional imbalance or if there was some overriding reason that we simply had to retain FPTP then I might not be so keen on some type of electoral reform.  But it isnt really all that difficult and Im not aware of a fundamental reason that would cause us to keep FPTP.If we pick the right system a much larger percentage of voters will have representation in the HoC by an MP that they helped to elect ie an MP who shares their approach to governing compared to FPTP.,CanadaPolitics,cxsmbja,1,t5_2s4gt

With one agency for the past few years Ive seen them advertise the same position every few months a senior data entry officer with DND requiring years of specialized experience to qualify. The pay rate is a few cents above minimum wage which explains why they have to keep hiring new people for it someone gets the job and quits after a few weeksmonths after finding a better job that pays more which would be basically any other job.

5930981,0,t1_cxx0ynb,Its tricky. Polarization plays a huge role.

I like many individual Conservatives.

5945128,0,t1_cxywgqf,Well it seems youre right.I think its clear then that the common justifications of the law used by politicians and promoters are either incredibly misleading or the speaker doesnt actually know whats the act.Lock is a normal colloquial term.  Its not specialized legalese.  Ask any ten people about the characteristics of a lock and the word key is going to come up ten out of ten times.So the copyright act doesnt seem to talk about digital locks at all.  Unless the law is actually so badly written that it uses the actual term lock elsewhere in the act and then defines it contrary to what the term normally means we should stop using the term.gt When you use a VPN to make it look like youre in a different country you are very clearly avoidingbypassing the intended function of the lock.First there is no lock.  Youre right that its a technological protection measure as defined by the act but to call it a lock is not accurate as I showed earlier.  Although if Im writing the law I could write a bad law that defines a pile of boxes as a lock I suppose.I can call a pile of boxes in front of my front door a lock if I want to but just like regioncoding that doesnt make it a lock as it has none of the attributes of a lock.If were going to have a public policy discussion we cant keep using misleading terms that do not accurately describe what were talking about.Second while Im bypassing the intended function of this restriction Im not actually bypassing the actual restriction.  And the intended function isnt relevant is it?  Please tell me the law doesnt say that its illegal to bypass whatever the designers of the restriction meant to do.  What the restriction actually does is relevant.  At least from what Im reading in what youve quoted from the act.  The intention of a region restriction is clearly to prevent people who are physically in Canada from accessing content intended only for a US audience.  But thats not actually what it does.  What it does is to restrict requests of access to computers that are physically inside the US.And a VPN complies with that completely.  Im simply using a different computer.  Im not hopping the fence restriction Im walking around the fence until I get to the open gate and then taking my material back out the gate around the fence and enjoying it in my original location.I can do that because the restriction doesnt actually have anything to do with my location only the requesting computer.  Netflix could create region restrictions differently.  It could create a video player that queried my location and then passed that location along the requesting channel.  Then it would be checking my location.  It wouldnt matter if I routed the request through a computer in Siberia.Of course they dont do that because they dont trust my computer to accurately report my location because I control it.But thats not my problem.  Their region restriction doesnt have anything to do with where I am thats just what they wish it did.,CanadaPolitics,cxyxpwl,1,t5_2s4gt

From there you can walk along a nice stretch of the PromenadeEast Beach right into the Marina district and to the famous Piers. Theres a lot to do but if you can avoid a lot of the traps. Coit Tower is interesting but really hard to access and a pain. SF is small and despite the many hills really walkable. I walked from Market all the way to the Castro to the Painted Ladies the House from Full house and Mrs Doubtfire at Alamo Square up the hills and down to Pier . Its a lot of fun and generally not too warm. ,CanadaPolitics,cy443xp,2,t5_2s4gt

I even specified before quoting that I was speaking about one particular comment. There was no nefarious purpose there and its ridiculous to even assume it.gtand also a comment three paragraphs long is not loweffort by the standards of this subreddit. Also there exist Top Comments . Surely the discussion should be judged on the top level comments and not just THE top comment eh? Now lets consider the argument of substantiation.Length doesnt equal effort. I could type abdascdasdfas for  lines and it still wouldnt be high effort. All his comment said was that any criticism of Trudeau is not based on fact.gtBecause it builds on its addressing of the article by anticipating rebuttals which requires considering potential arguments likely to be made and laying out why the author believes they arent valid criticisms?Its not anticipating rebuttals its just saying that anything antiTrudeau is based on imagination.gtIll inform the media that from now on everyone is to be judged not by their actions but by their parents and predecessors actions. I find it ridiculous that you would imply that Justin Trudeau should be judged by his father or by actions of former Liberal leaders. If he endorsed any specific measures by them then we will judge him by the merits of those specific measures. But the idea that Chretien is tainted by the sponsorship scandal and supported his own party therefore taints Justin Trudeau with that scandal or something is ridiculous.I never said that Trudeau should be judged by the action of his father or even that Chretien tainted them with the sponsorship scandal I just pointed out that theyre objectively not a new party free of the baggage of the past with a Trudeau at the helm and former Liberal PMs campaigning for him.gtOh that wasnt what specifically you meant? Im trying to figure it out because the criticism is that former LPC leaders campaigned for Trudeau and hes the son of Pierre Trudeau and neither of those things in and of themselves is in anyway negativeAgain I didnt say it was negative.gtNo it doesnt. To make that claim is to ignore the context of those two sentences having been a part of the exact same comment as the first two parts you quote which clearly indicates that they are dismissing the idea that the LPC should be criticized for wanting to institute IRV for cynical reasons when they clearly havent come out in support of that! Are you kidding me? Why do you keep putting words into my mouth? We were discussing the quoted comment and thats it. The comment literally dismissed any criticism of Trudeau as being made up.

I can only image the diligent CBC minions spotting the possibility of spinning the comparing of this costume to native head dress into a really important news story and rushing to the phones to assemble the team. Who can they call up to launch into one of their endless commiserations of how natives are being abused in Canada.Hey ufight are you aware that things like totem polls ceremonial masks and ceremonial regalia was actually stolen from Aboriginal people by the government?The Canadians government made ceremonies and these objects illegal because they were seen as evil and pagan by the Christian majority of the day.The Canadian government then sold these objects to museums and private collectors.Yes the Canadian competitor for Miss Universe showed a huge amount of insensitivity and cultural blindness when she decided to make these things her national costume. She knew this and even tried to claim it was a Dominican totem poll there is no such thing.Yes it is a valid news story especially if it makes people like you uncomfortable and forces you to confront your biases. I just hope that maybe you learn something about the Aboriginal peoples of Canada from this.gtSo who can deliver the most outraged commentary on this costume. It is a native woman from the Queen Charlottes I believe. Oops Haida Gwai I meanNo she is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic she isnt Aboriginal at all.

You would be up in arms if someone tried to rename your hometown province or country in disrespect and defiance of what you wanted it called.gt Is it possible there were any residential schools that treated natives with respect and kindness? Yes it is.There actually were at some points in time but that does absolutely nothing to mitigate the horrible things that were mostly done there. I also do not see at all how this has anything to do with your post unless youre attempting to mitigate and dismiss what went on in Residential Schools.gtJust open one of the latest issues of MacLeans magazine and you can read the story of the native writer Thompson Highway.His name is spelled Tomson Highway.gtFor him residential school was a marvelous opportunity to expand his horizonsTomson Highways experience in Residential Schools wasnt typical and he even states as much in the article youre referring to. He even wrote a book called Kiss of the Fur Queen that explored the negative aspects of Residential Schools.Further Tomson Highway has a reputation for being incredibly positive and optimistic I love him because of that.You sound almost exactly like my hardcore Catholic friend who complains that the CBC is antiChristian and shoving their views down his throat because they arent militantly homophobic like he is.Dude this whole post is not cool in any way it is full of biased language that makes your views perfectly clear endless commiserations  grievances natives Queen Charlottes etc.,CanadaPolitics,cya6dit,16,t5_2s4gt

She did that because the now deceased Coco our kitty had kidney failure.Here is the living room with the carpet removed you will notice the flooring is there. The room is  ft so I purchased  ft of  inch prefinished birch.I sealed the spot that Coco made her own. Washing and sealing has removed the odour.Before installing the flooring wax paper is stapled to the subfloor. The object on the floor is the baseboard heater  it became an insufferable pain in the ass.I rented a pneumatic stapler to nail down the flooring. Here is the completed project except for the installation of quarter round to conceal the edges. All other work was done with traditional tools as I have no power tools. Fortuneately the room turned out to be exactly wide enough for the flooring to fit as it should without me having to rip a piece the length of the room. Ripping the planks with a hand saw is hard for a tired old office worker like me.Last night we my son actually hosted  Grade  students for a New Years Eve party and it stood up well.The next project is to install  ft of laminate flooring in our family room.,CanadaPolitics,cyiifmg,5,t5_2s4gt

The way it was all wrapped up in political attacks as well probably didnt help him taking a calm view of the manner but doesnt excuse his continued denial of a problem.Mr ORegan has apparently come forward early in the game and had the courage to admit he has a problem and expressed the will to do something about it.For there to be a double standard Mr ORegan would have had to be publicly alcoholic for an extended period of time and then getting voluminous praise after finally going into rehab.

6154102,0,t1_cymj1z0,gt Imagine if you are a white male and youre unemployed. Say you and an equally qualified aboriginal woman apply for a job. Equity dictates that she gets the job.If Im an employer I presumably have many white men working for me and relatively few Aboriginal women. I would hire the Aboriginal women because she brings a different perspective to my shop which allows my business to be more nimble and creative. That gives me a business advantage and a chance to earn far more profit than if I hired yet another white man.The reason why I presumably have already hired many white men and few Aboriginal women is because white men make up roughly  of the population while Aboriginal women make up roughly  of the population. Its also why I probably got  resumes from white men and only  resumes from Aboriginal women.Eventually the number of Aboriginal women who can work for me will reach its maximum. Its simple demographics. I must then either hire more white men of which there is still an ample supply or forego hiring. The same applies to the entire country as a whole.Its pretty silly to assume that white men can and will be always passed over for a job that is instead given to an equally qualified minority. The demographics of our country mean that isnt likely to happen.

6199187,0,t1_cyu4dc1,gt  I want to see a description of the exact problem that requires fixing as well as a description of how the proposed change would fix it. FPTP is intensely vulnerable to clones which is to say indifference between a voters first two or more preferences.   For example if you took the CPC  result and reran the election with every candidate split in twain as in  Stephen Harper A and Stephen Harper B then the resulting votesplitting would have drastically reduced the CPCs total seatcount.     As a corollary this also discourages independents from running.  If they are too close in ideology to a party their spoiler effect might result in the leastpreferred candidate winning. It is too easy to vote strategically in FPTP.  Strategic voting only requires a reasonablyaccurate guess of your neighbours first preferences so that a voter might allocate their vote between a preferred and lesspreferred candidate to avoid the election of the leastpreferred.      Strategic voting in ranked systems requires more detailed but hardertoacquire knowledge of voters second preferences conditional upon their first strategic voting in proportional systems requires very detailed knowledge about the effect of marginal votes with respect to likely quota thresholds.  Neither of these can be affordablyobtained at the local level. FPTP penalizes parties with diffuse but strong support.  This is the perennial problem of the NDP but it is also faced regionally by other parties.  For example there are far more CPCaligned voters in Atlantic Canada than the seat count would reflect and the high individualseat thresholds imposed by FPTP really any singleseat system prevent Conservative Atlantic Canadians from having an effective spokesperson in Parliament. FPTP penalizes parties with concentrated but high support.  As a sort of converse to the previous problem FPTP in practice has a subset of safe seats where typical voting trends ensure that candidates of a particular party are perennially elected.    This penalizes those partys supporters by depriving the party of its true popular weight.  At the extreme this can even invert the results of the popular vote and seat selection a plurality of Qubec voters in  voted for PLQ candidates yet the Parti Qubcois won a substantial majority of seats.    The combination of the previous two points suggests that a politicallyastute individual can maximize the impact of their vote by moving.  This is perverse.,CanadaPolitics,cyua4wv,19,t5_2s4gt

6462831,0,t1_cznrcql,All religions are made up at some point.As far as belief goes. No one is born with religion it is something we force onto children and train them to believe. Adults might choose or are forced into it. But it is always grown and trained and instilled into someones belief structure. This is the same with pretty much any socialreligious structure. Belief in the state is another great example of a faith that is instilled. We send kids to years of schooling to instill that sincere faith and trust. If sincerity is all it takes then I can sincerely say that I am opposed to forced taxation. And that the state needs to provide value for money and allow me to choose another provider if I am not happy with the service I receive. Without giving up my home family and friends. I am perfectly sincere in my beliefs. Does that mean you will respect my religions beliefs? And that we should make it law now?Things only seem extreme to you because your acceptable range of options is very limited by your sincere faith in the things that have been instilled into your religious view of the world. It took years of training for you to get to your current view of the state and its power. Being politically correct means limiting your options to a fraction of the possibilities.

Our judges consider such decisions and always add the caveat  but we must look at US decisions with a degree of caution due to the different constitutional framework there.  Thats probably a better approach  to consider but caution  than ignore altogether. Also our courts do consider originalism in the context of division of powers disputes and rightfully so.

It means that a law was found as violating our civil rights by the courts even after granting what allowances exist in Section  the Reasonable Limits Clause and the federal government decided that it wanted to violate our civil rights anyway so it passes the law with a section saying the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is of no force or effect in regards to this law.If you dont find the prospect of any government left or right casually invoking the Notwithstanding Clause something that should make you take notice and maybe get worried even just a little then Im not sure you truly understand the gravity of such a situation.Considering how badly the Conservatives lost with immigrants and new citizens last election invoking the Notwithstanding Clause on C would probably been the death knell for the Conservative Party and they would have all known it.

6849172,0,t1_d0smna7,What I take issue with is that you dismiss the entire umbrella of feminism. There isnt a singular modern day feminist there are many schools of thought and some are better than others IMO. Bad eggs on both sides get attention because it drives views. That doesnt mean you or I have to repudiate feminism in its entirety. I still support the goal of equality of gender and agree with many feminists on various tools to overcome structural sexism.Justin Trudeau is not some scary feminist pouring urinewhatever it was on Lauren Southern hes suggesting we tackle the systemic sexism issues that women face on Intarnational Womens Day. I just dont see what the big fucking problem is with that. Should we be addressing male victims of domestic violence and sexual violence? Absolutely. Are these issues equal in magnitude to those facing women? No there are far more female victims but that doesnt mean that male victims should be ignored. On the whole women are still more generally disadvantaged than men. That means that there are going to be more issues and more resources that should go to womens issues but it also means that mens issues should get a proportional slice of attention for their issues too. As for Roosh as much as he does not like the label he is still a type of MRA due to his focus on male empowerment men being men. You can argue he is an MRA like the IRA is a charity sure but he still has male empowerment at the core of his horribly misguided message just as radical feminists are still considered feminists by their opponents. My point is that he does not represent the wider umbrella just as the feminists you criticize do not represent the whole of feminism. When you talk about Trudeau recruiting for his movement you denigrate the entirety of feminism based on a few extremists. I doubt you will find that a majority of feminists agree with the idea of pouring urine on Lauren Southerns head and similar craziness.I personally have no issue with being labelled a feminist as somebody who believes in gender equality. So long as its understood my goal is gender equality and the destruction of structural barriers for both genders you can call me an MRA a feminist or both even and it doesnt matter much to me. Even if viewing things from a purely female empowerment perspective reducing structural sexism for men such as lack of paternity leave is important as it encourages more equal participation in caregivinggets rid of the social expectation that it should be women who should be primary caregivers rather than an informed and unbiased choice for a couple.

6885513,0,t3_4a0tg6,I am personally going to tackle a few of the research focused points in the beginning. gt The first point concerns the sort of research that the National Research Council is funded to do gt Return the mandate of the National Research Council to research in the public interest including curiositybased research rather than the current requirement for NRCfunded research to be tied to commercial interests.For point  I disagree. Feel free to at least not limit research to commercial interests but we need to do more research in both practical agriculture and exploratory areas. The US is a fantastic model for this. They do a great job of getting new researchbreakthroughs to practical applications for producers to benefit. gt The second point has to do with reinstating public funding for agriculture research to be done by federal scientists or thirdparty groups with a mandate of public interest researchgtRedirect all current agricultural research funding to public and independent third party research in the public interest and reverse cuts to public agricultural research.  millionyear.Again federal researchers should be doing work that is not only exploratory but practical as well. The amount of new crops that are breed and never taken up by producers is quite high and often times it is from a lack of knowledge that they are available or a lack of knowledge about them. gt  The third point specifies upon what interests publiclyfunded agriculture research should be focused gtInclude public interest research priorities as follows renewed support for public plant breeding to develop varieties across a wide variety of crops adapted to Canadian regional climates support for public plant breeding undertaken in conjunction with farmerdirected organizations that direct funds towards the development of new varieties e.g. the Western Grains Research Foundation new research and assessments of the use of neonicotinoid insecticides and farming practices that could increase biodiversity and assessment and implementation of integrated pest management IPM programs run in the public interest and designed to benefit farmers and both natural and agricultural ecosystems.We already do this! Have they never looked at the research being done by the AAFC research centres You can go through each site and look at what their focus is at the site and you can look at individual researchers and what they are working on or have done. You would also notice that many of these federal researchers also work at universities or in conjunction with universities.  gt This point would basically rollback the PlantBreeders Rights provision of the Harper Governments Bill C Agricultural Growth Act that allows multinational agribusiness to claim royalties to previously unclaimed plant varieties. Instead it would guarantee common ownership of genetic plant materials for all people. Furthermore the AFB includes a provision that would create a system for matching seed varieties with the needs of growers so that the ideal seeds are being used that work best for a farmers conditions.Its interesting that this paragraph against the updated version of plant breeders rights intentionally misses the point that by providing better protection of IP around seeds in Canada we should see increased breeding for our regional needs which is the very same thing they demand in the first  points that the government should do. Plant breeding is extremely expensive and time consuming. Offloading some of that work on private corporations is a good thing. The Canadian government continues to work on new varieties of plants for producers as regardless. As for saving seed you are welcome to do that and no one is stopping you from doing so as long as you pay the royalties for the technology you are using. You chose that specific wheatcanolacornrape seedetc. variety for a reason whether its the potential higher yields or resistances or whatever other variable that the seed company invested to produce that you liked so much. You can damn well pay for it to benefit again. There are always other varieties you could choose from that are less... beneficial but have fewer strings attached to plant if you dont want to pay the royalties. Also seed companies already try to sell seeds that are best for that region already. Its not like their isnt commercial competition for seed distributors. I dont know many agronomist or seed sales people who would willing shoot themselves in the foot by knowingly selling seeds that are not going to do what you want especially since many producers often stick with the current provider until they screw up. Anyway thats all I will get into. Maybe ukofclubs might have something else to add. ,CanadaPolitics,d0wsfqk,3,t5_2s4gt

6928223,0,t1_d10q9mw,When I ride the metro every morning I am amazed at how multicultural Montreal is  yet I feel we have been having a toxic dialogue for the past few years regarding reasonable accommodation of newcomers and immigrants and there have been some divisive policies that came into play. My opinion is that often time the voices of visible minorities are being muted  I witness this again and again as we deal with one racereligion issue after another. There is a strong defense mechanism here in Quebec voices that defend the minorities in Quebec are not heard because they are told that they are mixing up race with nonrace related issue very patronizing or seen as Quebec bashing or is seen as a non issue because since the rest of Canada also has race problems and higher hate crimes this really is something that should not be worked on.What is interesting each time we come back to the same issue Hrouxvilles proposal for newcomers the Charter of Value or more recently the blackface incidents  migrants were told this really has nothing to do with race  this is about something else our intention is not racist  really you are mixing things up  but what this does is that it neglects the views of the minority. It ignores their experience within the Quebec context  when people do not have a voice they easily become powerless and alienated.  A major consequence of this has been radicalization in Quebec. We see this strong numbers in terms of ISIS recruits but also  the guy who shoot up parliament the other guy who crashed the car into military base and now this guy they all have link to Quebec. So the issue should not ignored... Recently we are talking about new history courses for high school students that apparently minimizes the role of nonfrancophone groups plays in Quebec. It seems there is a strong influence of extreme nationalists within our the power structure ... I think what is truly sad is that the PLQ does not seem to consider this an important priority or perhaps they are afraid to touch the issue since it has been so explosive and what is even more sad is that the PQ tried to use this issue to create the winning condition for separation. ,CanadaPolitics,d11n0zj,2,t5_2s4gt

The other issue is that we cannot allow rule breaking comments to be quoted in child comments. An example is this thread where the parent comment said that the source had disgusting dementia on the issue at hand. Theres no way we can allow that kind of content. The issue here is that child comments do have good points but also quote the dementia passage and approving those comments would effectively allow the dementia comment to stand and inflame further debate.

7127076,0,t1_d1o8ovj,gt Similarly the government has created the concept of patents copyrights and trademarks. Are they property? Lets imagine one day we come to our senses on patents and decide to overhaul the whole system cut patents from  to  years and significantly restrict what is considered patentable. Would we have to compensate e.g. foreign drug companies for the  years lost in sales of the estimated market value of their drug patents?I would suggest that yes they should. Or alternatively any existing patents should be grandfathered in. The latter approach to me seems far more reasonable. I dont think thats in line with property rights per se mind you. gt How about land value which is contingent on zoning and neighboring property. If the government rezones the beautiful park behind my house into an industrial waste dump or something halving the value of my home is that an infringement on my right to property? Could I get the rezoning struck down as a violation of my Charter rights?Doubtful. You still own said property. The value of  something is not an intrinsic property of the possession. gt How about other policy changes? If I open up a factory to manufacture a chemical which then turns out to be extremely toxic and the government bans it destroying  of the value of my business do they have to compensate me? Could I get the ban struck down?No. I dont see how this could reasonably be construed as a property right anyways. But the notion that such a restriction wouldnt at the very least pass the Oakes test is IMHO ridiculous. gt But do we really want the wealthy  and only the wealthy since you would have to own property affected and to be wealthy enough to challenge it in superior court  to be able to challenge pretty much any government policy in the courts when it affects them in a negative way?On an individual basis perhaps but collective property rights exist too.

The greatest border threat we have is the occasional Russian bomber flying over a place inhabited only by polar bears.Just because we do not have a land border with anyone other than the US does not mean that our proximity to Russia is irrelevant. Nor does it negate the ability for other states to see Canada as an easy pass into the US. You are making the mistake of assuming that the current global situation is going to remain constant which is impossible to be sure of since the future is entirely unpredictable. This is why we hedge our bets and prepare for as many potential bad scenarios as possible.gt We bought our Fs during the cold war when there was a real threat of high tech superpowers going to war and we could be caught right in the middle.

You are actively undermining your own point! Chinas continued rise to prominence on the world stage continues with significant question marks as to its outcome. Russia has reinvigorated military spending and expeditionary adventures.

This was supposed to be a modern multiple righter that could handle all military roles with a single airframe making it highly affordable. The result is an incredibly heavy slow aircraft that suffers from too many design compromises. Worse the benefits of these design compromises have not been realized as the the three variants are essentially completely different aircraft. Its  years behind schedule and  billion over budget. Even in the world of aerospace this is a stunning accomplishment.You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. The F is pretty par for the course as far as aerospace developments go as explained here The F is still one of the cheapest options for aircraft and continues to be technologically lightyears ahead of any other option.gt Lets do ourselves a favour and ask if we really need such a plane.

We might not and probably wont find ourselves in a world war but we may find ourselves in proxy or hybrid engagements where Russian or Chinese tech is employed against us.

For the most part they are ignorant of native issues and ignorant of natives in general. What I mean is they and their issues arent a part of their daily lives enough for them to have strong feelings either way. They arent a factor for them.

I built an observation post around their homeworld and guided their development. They quickly gained empire status as my vassal.Later I came across a collectivist empire who wasnt impressed with my ethos but we remained cordial and maintained embassies.My research really started to take off once I researched Sentient AI and reformed my government. By this time I had five technologies to choose from each time. I simultaneously researched Robot tech quickly and luckily followed by Droid and Synth tech.The third empire was a fallen empire of holy guardians. I established an embassy with them too. Eventually I couldnt resist colonizing a size  Gaia world. I made that the seat of my empire capital complex and filled it with level  science buildings and synths. The fallen empire didnt seem to notice though.Now my income and tech were off the charts. I built a large fleet of my highest tech ship designs and launched a war to vassalize my larger but weaker neighbour. After progressing through two systems I had destroyed so much of their fleet that they surrendered.As I was filling in the new habitable worlds in the outer rim I picked up busts of energy in the only part of the galaxy I had yet to explore. By the time I had gotten my fleets over there the Prethoryn Swarms vanguard had come through. I was able to destroy the vanguard but the main force quickly overpowered me.I can win now by vassalizing the third empire which is pretty small or by colonizing seven more habitable planets.

7615453,0,t1_d37mmaa,From the actual study referenced in the article you linked togt In view of these other expenses it appears that residential geothermal systems are not economically interesting in Toronto and Vancouver. Indeed predictably Toronto has no return on investment the cash flow at the end of the life cycle indicates a considerable financial loss of  . In Vancouver a  lightly smaller financial loss of   occurs after  years.gtTorontos situation is caused by the very unfavorable ratio between the price of electricity and natural gas which exceeds the gain in energy efficiency provided by the heat pump. For Vancouver the same phenomenon occurs to a somewhat lesser extent but in addition the milder climate reduces the impact of the efficiency of the overall energy bill to a point that it is insufficient to cover the cost of the heat pump.If its not economically viable in Toronto primarily due to the cost of electricity then that can be generalized to the entire province and this is an Ontario initiative. Beyond that Id be willing to bet that the average ground temperature in Toronto is warmer and therefore more favorable to geothermal than most other places in Ontario simply because its so far south.Not to mention that by the authors own admission that .k installation cost excludes the cost of the pump itself kgtThe drilling and installation costs in Canadian dollars including taxes were set at   and the heat pump at  for a total of  .... and they further admit that thats a lowball estimategt These values are expected to be closer to a lower limit for this type of equipment in Canada. Indeed based on recent quotations obtained from our industrial partners the heat pump could reach  in price while the price for the well could be as high as   for a house with  m of surface area. The rationale behind the choice of a total of   is that if simulations show that the project is not economically viable at this price a more detailed analysis needs not be pursued.Back to my point if they legislate electric or geothermal only the electric system will almost always win since it will always be a cheaper system to install if not to operate long term.Since this requirement would apply to new construction are you seriously going to argue that any home building companies are going to opt for the more expensive option in their basic models? At best youll see a few niche richer developments with a geothermal system.I have heard that there are some huge advantages to building communal geothermal systems that share a ground loop which can feed several homes and Id love to see that get widely adopted for a number of reasons.,CanadaPolitics,d37u5hq,7,t5_2s4gt

7644084,0,t3_4jx53o,The motion is absurd.Most of it is actually pretty okay. Its an interesting twist on the usual approach to opposition who want to excessively limit debate rather than saying that debate will be limited the government is effectively saying that theyre going to make the House sit as long as it takes for the debate to end. The opposition always wants their cake and to eat to too and if theyve usually been getting the cake the governments giving them the eating and taking away the cake.The bits about dilatory motions and the like are basically there because the rule of the House suck and provide too many ways to obstruct business for no reason. Thats nobodys right and the rules should be permanently fixed to account for that.What is patently ludicrous however is that this motion would allow the government the unilateral ability to close the debate whenever it wants each day and then the unilateral ability to declare that its summer break time. Even if its entirely wellintentioned thats too much power that the government cant have. The opposition needs to be constantly on guard and watching whats going on in the House but if the government doesnt like it or if their MPs are getting tired they can just say that theyre done for the day.Ill note that there are two areas where I think most commentators are wrong. First I doubt this would stop the procedural trick that the opposition pulled on Monday of not moving a motion for which notice had been given thereby accelerating another vote. If the opposition tried that again the government wouldnt have the opportunity to seek the floor for a motion to adjourn before the House started the vote and you cant interrupt a vote for anything.Second this doesnt limit debate on opposition motions. What it does is it simply leaves their limits where they would normally be at which point the House would adjourn or proceed to Private Members Business. As a result of this motions limits they have simply said that the extra hours cant be used to handle opposition motions instead the House will go back to considering Government Orders.Something not mentioned so much the late show questionandanswer period wont happen but it is more a casualty of the arcane and ludicrous procedures defining its existence than anything else.,CanadaPolitics,d3b3aj8,3,t5_2s4gt

Perhaps SOCAN should be directing the monies collected to the distributors of CanCon instead of the artists. With a financial reward for hosting CanCon some may be better motivated and others whose business models are different are not punished.That would indeed be a worthy experiment.  Why cant Netflix for example get bonus perview funding if it hosts Corner Gas?  That provides them an incentive to market Canadian content which is currently wholly lacking and notwithstanding distribution covenants like I proposed it would allow providers to compete for popular Canadian content monetarily.Areas like this are where CanCon rules need modernizing.

First off Gun laws and self defence laws are a good way to rally conservatives rural folks and those who live in fear of criminals the CSSA has provided a simplified classification system which I believe should be implemented. Furthermore the right to defend oneself by any means necessary to prevent harm or the threat of harm WITHIN ONES HOME OR PROPERTY should be inalienable. This would still prevent people from carrying firearms with them on the street.Next I would argue for the repeal of hate speech laws and the kangaroo court tribunals that follow. They are an attack on free speech and expression advocating directly for violence against a group or people would still be illegal.Abortion should be discouraged in favour of condoms birth control etc. but not illegal. There is no value in forcing women into back alleys or carrying an unwanted child to term. If they are not responsible enough to use contraceptive methods they are not capable of raising a child that much is obvious. I personally am nonreligious but I see nothing wrong with a church or any religious institution refusing to wed a same sex couple because it is against their values.

This deliberate restriction upon the amount of these products which can be produced serves as the ultimate barrier to entry shielding existing producers from competition allowing them to charge far more for their products than they should be able to in a free and competitive market. This is backed up by steep tariffs upon such products produced abroad. Going rate for the rights to milk a single cow is almost k alone and thats just the rights not actually including buying the cow or any of the other associated expenses.

7799188,0,t1_d3sg7l7,First off Id like to take a moment to breathe in the fact that Im having a conversation on reddit in a politics sub concerning a nontrivial case of biblical narrative and application. Im loving this!gtI realize youre being kind of ironic here but weve been speaking with an assumed distinction between divine law and human law this entire time at least so I thought.Yes I am being ironic. I guess what I was feebly pointing towards there is that God put religious beliefs into law so there is a precedent for that being a morally good action.gtWhich really seems to be where were misunderstanding each other. If I understand you correctly you feel that as Christians its our obligation to push human law as close to divine law as possible yes? You have a solid theological argument for that in any case. Youre close to understanding me here. I feel that as Christians it is our obligation to promote justice especially towards the poor single mothers and foreigners. This isnt quite synonymous with Gods law though I wouldnt use that term for what Im talking about. I for instance am under authority and according to that authority I am in a permanent state of sobriety. I do this out of deference to the authority and recognition of the truth that we are here as sojourners and are to remain ready for the sake of Christ. This isnt a matter of justice though it is a matter of the will of God. In short it is a matter of sanctification in contrast to justification or the doing of justice. That is something that is also to be promoted but I dont think it makes sense to promote it as legislation.gtAgain you should give Galatians another go because from the amount of OT gotcha quotes youre throwing at me it really seems like you dont get it. Specifically chapters  and .Ah. For the sake of clarity simple imperatives are nice and since the early church was not in a position of power from which they would be looked to expectantly for legal justice as the powers that be I figured that the Prophets would be the best place to look. In particular since the prophets are in opposition to the teachers of the law but rather are a form of God speaking his heart to people I thought that would be most appropriate. However the Bible is a big book so I can argue it from the NT exclusively though it will be a little more roundabout. As a side note but only a side note I take issue with the characterization of the quotes as gotcha quotes since I provided not mere proof texts but rather examples of a theme that is absolutely overflowing in the prophets hence quoting three separate prophets and referring to the entire books of two of the largest. However before I get on to arguing from the NT Galatians. Chapter  talks briefly about justification specifically by faith and separation from Jewish customs. If we are to extrapolate a bit we might also talk about Christian customs but that may be a mistake. Chapter  continues concerning justification driving the point home that we are not justified by the law. In particular this sums it upgtFor if a law had been given that could give life then righteousness would indeed be by the law. But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.However this is improper in a context concerning those who may not believe and specifically concerns justification which requires faith in Christ which by its very nature cannot concern unbelievers. Indeed these matters are of prime importance in Christian life and it is a mistake to focus on anything else without regard for andor to the exclusion of this. So this is more important than the issue of legislation. However justification by its nature leads to sanctification in which we find a desire no a need...for love. And it is on that basis and also on the basis of kindness goodness and to a lesser extent peace from which flows my argument for legislation. This should put Micah  in its proper place in Galatians. You can see how this is merely an implication of faith albeit with significant biblical precedent and far less important than the issue of justification! However it isnt unimportant either. So heres one of the instructions that came about as a consequence of loving others  Tim bgtFirst of all then I urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way. This is good...So we are to pray for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead peaceful lives. However that isnt necessarily to say that is a place to stop especially considering that we unlike most of the early church are citizens. Heres a piece hacked out of James gtif one of you says to them Go in peace be warmed and filled without giving them the things needed...what good is that?So then having as we do some measure of high position and having things to offer for the government of a country it behooves us to not merely bless the government but participate! While I have quoted James  somewhat out of context I believe that this is a general principle that has manifested itself here and is consistent with the overarching narrative of James. In a similar vein if we are to be like Paul who in Galatians  was asked that we should continue to remember the poor the very thing I had been eager to do all along. then that would entail personal sacrifice and in addition to that advocating for the poor with our position with respect to government. Furthermore it is right for us to judge matters of the world  Cor  alas it is not applied much anymore.So it is hardly the case that this is merely a relic of a old covenant.ampnbspgtI feel that the problem with that in todays context is when we think about morally grounded legislation as Christians we all too often talk about what should we stop people from doing and almost never talk about what should we be encouraging. You see what I mean? Jesus called us to lead by example and to imitate him.I absolutely agree that morally grounded legislation has had a really rough time. Often times to me it sounds like people havent thought things through they just think something is reallyreally bad And indeed part of that is because such legislation loses sight of the change in action that it desires. However I contend that part of the reason for the focus on you should not rather than you should is a result of the fact that it is legislation. Achievable justicecentered legislation will naturally tend to focus on avoiding problematic situations rather than requiring good ones. So you get things like dont charge fees too exorbitant or dont hurt people this way. But both Jesus Matt  and Paul Gal  talk about how the Israelite law mandates the absence of a bad behavior and in so doing points towards the good behavior. And while it isnt necessarily that way with our law because people are people some compromises have to be made Matt .gtAggressively pushing legislation is embarrassingly bad leadership compared to what Christ did. This has a special and urgent meaning in the cases of abortion because legislation on both of those specific issues can put people between a rock of their needs andor desires and a hard place of the law. In those specific cases if that is all we were to do then indeed the following appliesgtJesus replied And you experts in the law woe to you because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.But generally people believe whether or not it is true that maternity leave adoption and other government procedures do help deal with that. Im not so sure but thats the argument we dont just leave the subjects of such law high and dry. Abortion is special though it most cases I dont think this applies. Furthermore I dont think thats a reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater sotospeak with regard to legislating justice.gtWhats more were to remove the plank from our eyes before we point out the specks in others. And if we cant do that properly as the fiasco around homosexuality and abortion has proven what right do we have to act as if were the judges of morality? Can you think of a group of people that thought they were the judges of morality who controlled the laws of their culture and who Jesus actively campaigned against?With regard to issues of justice it is one thing to be careful about removing specks from others eyes it is completely another to remove the spear that sticking out of their forehead so that they occasionally maim or wound people and it is quite urgent...ok bad analogy but you get my point. I come at this from the perspective that we can judge what is just  Cor .

8019232,0,t1_d4heior,gt Theres a critical distinction here the SCC ruled that s.  and s. b of the Code as the stood at the time and until last week were unconstitutional and declared them to be of no force or effect. That was indeed a binding judgment and one that every court is obligated to follow.But the point that youre simply not dealing with is that they also said something not limited to the four quarters of that law as it stood at the time. They said that a criminal prohibition on a certain class of people breaches s.  and is not saved by s. . They literally said that. They dont just articulate rights like that willy nilly. When the SCC writes judgments they mean every single word. Especially when the government is arguing really hard that they should confine those words to the terminally ill. If anything I think Justice Karakatsanis who seems to think that Carter is a rejection of a restriction for the nonterminally ill would be quite peeved to learn she has interpreted the judgment she wrote incorrectly. gtBut now the law has changed. The precedent does not directly apply.What the SCC said about criminal prohibitions on that class of people remains the law applies to any subsequent act of parliament. You simply have not articulated a legal reason why it does not. Now when the SCC clearly states a certain right that belongs to a class of people you need some fairly substantial evidence that they didnt mean what they said but here you dont have any. gtThe only pronouncement that the Court made re constitutionality was that a blanket prohibition against assisted suicde is unconstitutional.For everyone? So youre telling me that literally anyone could grab one of these judicial exemptions post June th? Or was the law only unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited a certain class of epople. gt The defined class you speak of was only referred to in para  when the Court established the remedy.Yes the holding of Carter. The most important part. The statement of the law. gtPerhaps but not in the sense that the Court was seized.The Court was seized of the matter completely. What I think you mean is that the issue of nonterminal illnesses wasnt an issue before the court. It was. Kay Carter had a nonterminal illness and as I told you the government argued that point in the alternative in three levels of court. Anywho the point still stands that the absoluteness of a prohibition has nothing to do with the class to whom it applies. C remains an absolute prohibition for people whose death is not reasonably foreseeable. gtDeclarations of constitutional invalidity should never be interpreted that way. Declarations of constitutional invalidity should be interpreted as any other judgment. Youd apply some special rules to this one but you cant actually tell me why. Lets go back to my Feeney example since youre suggesting this is the approach for all constitutional declarations. Lets say the government was unhappy with this and the next time the police search someones house without a warrant they argue that R v Feeney was a decision based on the facts of Mike Feeney and the facts of his house this other case was a semidetached house and the crown is entitled to relitigate the issues at play in Feeney. Is that kosher? You seem to be really attached to this position so lets have an answer Given that the government fully argued your position in front of the SCC in Carter and were unsuccessful are they precluded from arguing it again by stare decisis? And more importantly how are the SCC going to treat the second kick at the can having heard it already. ,CanadaPolitics,d4hfq5y,1,t5_2s4gt

The correct way to understand Condorcets voting paradox in my view is that it shows us that every democratic electoral system is going to have an element of arbitrariness in it. Since the legislative process is based on the majority principle every democratic system will need to do something more than just add up votes in order to constitute the majority that will make legislative decisions.Yes but here Im disappointed in Heath for overlooking the obvious conclusion the Condorcet paradox provides us a bound on the amount of arbitrariness in the voting system we should expect.If there truly are shifting pairwise majorities its fair to say that the electorate is collectively undecided and there is no manifestly fair way to pick a winner.  However if there is a single Condorcet winner then not picking them is very much unfair.Saying Condorcet paradox and throwing up ones hands is equivalent to saying a house cant be airtight so we dont need to worry about a roof.,CanadaPolitics,d4i8ny6,17,t5_2s4gt

Look at how many people are unable to find work in big cities across Canada too many if you ask me. Add automation and the problem gets worse.This is supply and demand.

Im not sure where this neoLiberal idea of immigration came from but its a falsehood.You dont need more labourers to boost the economy. If there was a surplus of jobs adding more people to the workforce would help. As it stands the best way to boost the economy would be to put more money in to the hands of consumers. Stifling the free flow of labour in to Canada will create demand for labourers increasing wages people will flock to lowskill jobs theyd regularly avoid for the money. More money means more income tax and sales tax which will support our already large welfare programs.

Theyve also long been legitimised in the eyes of those who hold such beliefs by the policies of the parties that have dominated our nations  aracial immigration policies antidiscrimination laws racial minorities in all major parties.Now add the effects of recent and rapid demographic change as well as changes in telecommunications that have both unified and stratified society in new and very different ways.  People in small white towns now see news coverage and media from major urban areas and realize just how racially diverse America has become.  Now mix in the current economic troubles and particularly the protracted death rattle of the traditional economic middle class.  We have a generation of young white men with latent racism now poorer than their fathers and with fewer prospects.  Who live in a world where a sharply dressed rather wealthy black man is the President.  And now finally throw in a major political force on the right that is explicitly rejecting political correctness that is to say inhibitions on spouting bigotry as killing America that is to say the America that resembles the communities they grew up in and blames most of these economic and social woes on foreigners other countries and minorities.The racists are a minority even a shrinking minority.  But the belief that they are in a lifeanddeath struggle to prevent the extermination of their nations has gone from being halfheartedly held by all but an extremist fringe among racists to being rather mainstream.

Then the hacker can do whatever they want really whether thats changing votes results or other malicious actions. Thats pretty much game over since the hacker now controls the results of the election.With paper ballots trying to steal an election without being caught is remarkably hard especially in a first world democracy like Canada. Third world countries get caught doing it all the time by election monitors since its pretty hard to hide swapping out boxes of ballots at hundreds or thousands of locations without someone noticing.The main problem really is that some actors would expend a great deal of money and resources to influence an election.

Even in a system owned by the masses there would be administrators that dictate how much you eat producers that have control over how much they produce and depending on how society is setup whether they even produce at all and so on. In any sort of social system even in the animal world this is inescapable.Well the Marxist materialist theory claims that the endstate of society is essentially something similar to huntergatherers which some Marxists call primitive communism. Everything until that point yes there probably would be people still making societal decisions but their incentives would be different. Under capitalism the incentive is typically profit and monetary gain whereas in a communalist system the incentive would probably be egalitarianism or something along to the to each according to their need line of thinking.gt There seems nothing inherent in socialism that changes the fact that there are inequalities. If the same sort of theorizing that says otherwise is that which came up with the demonstrably false labour theory of value it makes a very unconvincing argument in todays understanding of economics.Inequality will always exist but that doesnt mean we cant do something to minimize it and create a more fair playing field. In Canada we have public education public healthcare a wide range of social services etc. We dont need to have these things but we do because they tend to make things more fair for everyone and our social preference for these things outweighs any private benefits that might accrue from having a market system of healthcare or education.And yes the labour theory of value is well outdated but as a masters economics student and a person interested in Marxism I dont think you should entirely discount Marxism or really any idea for that matter based on its propositions. Capital up until the labour theory of value is quite a good read and its construction is based on a pretty sturdy interpretation of economic activity that I think is still relevant today. Its also worth noting that while the labour theory of value might be bunk in terms of the social valuation of commodities Marxs observations about how labour relations form the socially necessary amount of labour and therefore influence population and economic growth are not all that unreasonable.,CanadaPolitics,d5wwo0g,12,t5_2s4gt

The interesting part is how they have created a politically viable system that achieves that.One big difference is that zoning law is determined by the national government rather than local governments which makes it more responsive to the needs of the whole population. There appear to be numerous cultural differences as well due to earthquakes structures are seen as more temporary and older lessdurable structures are seen as needing replacement rather than preservation. Its definitely an extremely laissezfaire approach. The downside of this is that some consider Tokyo as quite ugly with little visual coordination.I think the lesson here might be that we need a higher level of government to ensure that zoning policy is working in the interests of all Canadians but perhaps more aesthetic choices and the distribution of density can be directed by local governments.Ive been looking for an analysis of Viennas approach as its also notable for its affordable housing and being an incredibly beautiful city.,CanadaPolitics,d69b336,6,t5_2s4gt

As much as I disliked the slogan that a carbon tax is a tax on everything I do acknowledge the pervasiveness of fossil fuels in todays world. To link this back to an earlier comment I accept that the replacement effect is real and that the direction of the effect is positive.  My uncertainty is around the magnitude of the effect.Maybe Im looking at this the wrong way but lets take that famous Saskatchewan export crop of wheat.  I would think that if fuel costs are a major portion of total input costs then a modest shift in the cost of fuel in AB vs SK would exacerbate the replacement effect and if fuel costs are dwarfed by other costs then the replacement effect would be more muted.AFAIK fuel costs are about  of variable costs and closer to  of total costs.  A carbon tax of tonne equates to about  cliter which would increase fuel costs by less than  which means that variable costs increase by about  and total costs increase by about ..Yes directionally this pushes the balance away from AB wheat and towards SK wheat but the magnitude of the push is so low.

Your examples of mass immigration from Europe to North America involve very similar cultures and a general lack of communications i.e. there was no mass telecommunications infrastructure then. The issue there is that the immigrants then were relatively isolated once they arrived. Sure they may have had some ghettos but overall they didnt enjoy the ability to talk to anyone anywhere on the planet. That lack of communication eroded ethnic cohesion and fostered assimilation into their new environments. People were forced to deal more directly with the people around them. That no longer holds true with the mass immigration of muslims into the West now. They are far more likely to retain barbaric cultural practices e.g. honour killings. Today you dont need to speak English or even leave the house to live in North America. Internet infrastructure and telecommunications have relieved those needs e.g. online grocery delivery.

It argues that Germany should be more selective of the refugees it allows in only allowing immigrants that are highly skilled to meet the future needs of the workforce. The calculations used to estimate costs made ridiculous assumptions as well. gtAssuming a total pool of five million immigrants flowing in and a more likely mix of  skilled immigrants to  unskilled or lowskilled ones the net costs would rise to  billion euros per year.Alright but the first link you provided said total immigration was . million and only half of those were refugees. His estimate is more than double the actual number of total immigrants and more than four times the actual number of refugees. His estimate of . trillion drops to billion. Thats without even getting into the fact he assumes costs would remain constant over time amp ignores the effects of inflation.

If hes not out then hes still receiving the benefits of white cis male privilege. I see your point but the logic doesnt really hold. If he is for example gay then he still suffers from hearing homophobic comments and jokes from those around him and is more likely to hear such if he is closeted he still has to worry about negative consequences of being seen with his boyfriend and not just in terms of gay bashing but in terms of being outed against his will in a great many workplaces he would have to wonder if he would be fired if people knew which at least an openly gay person doesnt have to fear directly. Etc. So in many ways being closeted if that is the case makes life harder for him. Coming out itself can be very hard yes but being out is in many ways easier than remaining closeted. Which is to say the closet is the hell a homophobic society builds for gay people. Sure in some narrow ways passing as straight can allow one to get some specific benefits of straight privilege but to insist that they arent really a minority is fairly toxic notion.

There is the conscious dislike of women being uppity which certainly has faded greatly in the last few decades but studies show that we still judge the same characteristics much differently from women and men. Do people consciously think How dare she do that shes a WOMAN! No for the most part I dont believe they do. However I do think she gets judged as corrupt robotic etc. in ways that a man behaving in exactly the same way would not be. So are people motivated by sexism to judge her more harshlydifferently? No. Are they affected by bias about how they feel about her and her actions because shes a woman? Yes yes I think they are and studies on hiring practices granting tenure approving proposals judging talent etc. when people are aware of the gender of the person they are judging back this up. Its worth noting that its not a bias that men hold against women its a bias that everyone holds against women including women.

9677522,0,t1_da5ovky,I want to expand on this because youre right.The federal government just approved the use of diamorphine i.e. pharmaceutical heroin.  Doctors have also always been free to prescribe nearequivalents like morphine or hydromorphone if they feel it is in the medical best interest of the patient.  These usually work better than drugs like bupenorphrine or methadone because they are pharmacologically more similar to heroin.  The problem here to implementing this as a widespread strategy faces many obstacles both in logistics and culture.  Diamorphine is not cheap in North America and I doubt its covered or likely to be covered by any provincial drug plan any time soon.  The other opiates like morphine are covered and actually very cheap  the most raging opiate addict could probably sustain it if they had prescriptions for  a month and those drugs usually are covered for the poor and especially those on welfare in most provinces.However your family GP is not going to be either comfortable or frankly competent to manage this.  Only a psychiatrist competent and familiar with addiction is going to be comfortable and IMO able to safely prescribe a maintenance dose to someone presenting with difficult opiate addiction which has failed more conservative management.  There are also administration issues  you cannot write an opiate addict except maybe after months of responsible use which has been tracked through urinalysis to confirm theyre not adjuncting with street drugs etc. a longterm supply of these drugs.  Daily dispensing is the ideal though every  days is common too.  Thats an administrative and logistical burden both for the patients and the pharmacists and the physicians who have to for example monitor blood or urine samples every week for adjuncting with street drugs or dose escalation etc.There is also an enormous cultural issue here not just in general society but in medicine.  For lack of a better word I would say stigma.  The approach we take with opiates is not the one we take with certain other addictive substances.  Both alcohol and benzodiazepines Xanx Valium etc. are highly addictive and also have the unpleasant property of being potentially fatal in withdrawal.  If you have been drinking  beers a night for the last  months or on  mg a day of Valium for months and you simply run out or decide to stop or whatever and you present to the ER they may do some stuff like check your blood levels to see you have been on high dose benzodiazepines but they will write you a maintenance prescription right there on tthe spot.  Doctors know that not doing that could mean you could have a seizure and die.  In the emergency care situation especially without a physicianpatient rapport and access to medical history its usually a short dose perhaps  days of a longacting agent but in the outpatient setting the consenus in psychiatry is that an extremely slow taper if possible at the patients own directionpace  is the optimal way to manage this.  But since opiate withdrawal wont physically kill you directly the whole conversation seems to end there.  Tough it out son.  We refuse to look at the longterm patterns especially the dangers of relapse.  There is some evidence that every cycle of withdrawal and relapse actually amplifies the severity of the withdrawal and a patient is it at great risk of overdose in the period where they have no tolerance to the drug but still have habituation and cravings as they often massively overestimate the dose they need to get high or even just relieve their symptoms.  On a per capita level that longterm pattern of opiate use and withdrawal probably kills the severely dependent more often than e.g. benzo withdrawal seizures will.  But we dont look at the big picture I think because of moralism and stigma.  There are doctors that coldturkey patients taking longterm opiates for legitimate pani reasons or taper them extremely quickly.  The natural consequence of this is to source illicitly to relieve the extreme discomfort they face.  Usually it starts with simply sourcing the drug or a similar drug they were prescribed but on the street things like Vicodin can run to  a tab and most people cannot support such a habit financially.  Traditionally they have turned to heroin at that point which is much cheaper and also much more dangerous.  Were now seeing substitution with fentanyl and carfentanil often without the addicts knowledge  Yeah man these pills are straight pharmaceutical Oxy check the imprint but its actually baking powder and some carfentanil mixed in.  I have a feeling the opiate equivalency calculations done by the traffickers and the scale used to measure out these milligram and even microgram doses werent done to the standards or calibrated to the precision and accuracy youd see by a physician and a pharmacist lets just say.  The number of opiate addicts who were started on legitimate prescriptionsby doctors for legitimate pain and then essentially abandoned is horrifying and I believe one of the most repugnant practices in contemporary medicine.  There are maany reasons for this.  The pharmaceutical industry for example has spent the last century  starting all the way back with Bayers introduction of heroin as a lessnonaddictive form of morphine of trying to present their opioid drugs as nonaddictive.   OxyContin was supposed to be less addictive.  Same with Fentanyl. The natural consequence of even moderateterm opiate use is addiction even when taken entirely with medical prescription.  The nature of these drugs practically begs people with access to them to fall into a pattern of using them to deal with stress and emotional pain  anyone who has taken a strong opiate especially over some time  will understand the insidious nature  of this attraction.  Theres evidence that opiates produce stronger pleasure responses in people with histories of trauma and abuse  I distinctly remember from one interview with a young female indigeneous opiate addict who had been horrifically sexually abused as a child and in her teens.  The doctor gave her opiates for a legitimate pain purpose.  She described the effect like it was like when my mommy hugged me when I was a little girl before she died. So we have people usually who have fallen into a pattern of coping with emotional pain or stressors with drugs often originally prescribed medically and our response is to cut them off.  Their natural response is to attempt to alleviate the immediate suffering and at this point they usually have no medical guidance as sorry doc I crushed and snorted all that oxy you gave me often essentially terminates the patientdoctor relationship.  Opiates are usually indicated in a time that can be described as stressful for the patient and then we respond to the development of addiction by heaping as much possible stress as imaginable by cutting off both something they are using to cope with stress and pain and also inducing withdrawal.  We expect good results from this?  I consider this thought process essentially insane but I think we are blinded by moralism and stigma here.  The last thing any addict needs is more stress in their lives.  They need comfort medical supervision of their addiction the minimization of the harms of street drug use as much as possible ideally through substitution with safe pharmaceutical opiates and usually support in stabilizing basic things like nutrition and housing.  The evidence bears this out  heroin maintenance therapies in Europe objectively appear to be superior to any other form of severe addiction management in terms of everything from discontinuation of the drug to life expectancy to HIV rates to subjective reported quality of life.I think as a society we are starting to finally see it in these terms but it has been an excruciatinly slow process.

But that is a completely different argument.That out of the way  the idea that profiling must work because it exists is stupid. There could be something keeping profiling around even though it doesnt work. Racism and implicit biases. That seems pretty obvious to me. If profiling doesnt work which I dont believe it does and cops have implicit biases which they definitely do cops would continue profiling despite it not working. What is dishonest is saying that profiling is not a racial issue. You can claim that cops arent targeting races but that is straight up a lie. It is called racial profiling for a reason. Claiming that cops only target blacks because they dress like thugs is borderline racist. Black people dress how they dress and that should not affect how often police stop them.

Theyre still motivated but by other things prestige independence selfsatisfaction etc.  Not necessarily in that order.  You cant take generalizations and apply them to individuals perfectly but for purposes of illustration Elon Musk isnt motivated by money at this point.  Hes going plenty of money.  Hes still driven but its for other things.  Hes obviously an exceptional case but the data is pretty clear.  Money is a big motivator below a certain comfort level.  This comfort level is still pretty high and well above the average income.  Its not I have a roof over my head.  Its more like I dont have to worry about money anymore.The reason tax em until they squeal is a bad idea is simply because it doesnt work.

I am extremely proud to be a Canadian state but dont really identify strongly with a national identity that is based on shared history  ethnicity  values although my parents happen to be of european descent.What makes Canada great is our tolerance for many different nations within one state. We were founded as a compromise between our original english and french dominated colonies upper and lower Canada were basically ontario ans quebec. We have acknowledged that Quebec is a unique nation within the state of Canada and have decentralized power to respect that fact.The really interesting part is that we basically did the same thing with many other ethnic groups all over the country. Toronto has areas where Mandarin Arabic East Indian languages and others are the primary language on signs spoken on streets and in businesses. Laws restricting cultural religious or language are abhorrent to most of us.We call it multiculturalism. And it just fucking works.

10300730,0,t3_5ngrlg,Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooof youre asking QUITE the question here mate. This one is being massively unpacked by scholars all across Canada right now as I type this at  MST.The reason we offer them different benefits is for a number of historical reasons. Historical context is the foundation for any discussion about reparation. The fact is... We fucked Indigenous peoples up. Horrifically. This is undisputable. We the state the country of Canada attempted to stamp out Indigenous cultures via assimilative policies hefty cultural restrictions displacement read up on Big Bear in regards to treaty   and the horrific Residential Schools. This is known as White Settler Colonialism. Canadas purpose for a long time was simply to destroy and replace Native cultures. This goes beyond Britain and France being dicks. It extends to John A. Macdonald and Canadas role begins with Federalism. The purpose of Federalism initially was to do two things unite Canada and settle the west. By settling the west the Canadian Government was essentially telling the first nations to fuck the dick out. This is why we have treaty land! That is its own University class and I really cant be asked to unpackage it too much for you. Theres also this thing called the Indian Act which again is its own University course and frankly I dont know too much about to even begin properly telling you. Theres a lot to unpack.So now the issue sits nicely in whats called The Politics of Recognition. Im currently reading a book on it called Red Skin White Faces. If you truly want to know more about Indigenous recognition and reparation I would absolutely implore you to pick up a copy.The last part of your sentence piques the former paragraph... gtWill this ever change andor end? The answer is we dont know. No one does. No one really knows where Aboriginal politics is currently hurtling. The best thing we can do is look at the Indigenous argument. We have followed a very whitewashedCanadian narrative for a very long time and hearing the other side of the story is incredibly important.Maybe in time the reparation will end. Maybe it will be heightened. It all depends on who is in power. If the NDP are elected Indigenous rights will increase and if the torysliberals stay in power than it will likely stay the course.Id like to finally say that the benefits are not extensive. Its all about perspective. Coming from a white middleupper class family I can safely say that if Aboriginal rights were applied to me it would be a pretty sweet deal!But thats why I dont have it. I dont need it. My family all attended University. I can at no real expense of my own. We can live our daytoday life out with very little worry or threat. We can practise our religions and cultures with ease. We can proudly proclaim were Canadians. We can ignore if we really wanted the legacy of Residential Schools. I am very lucky to be as privileged as I am.Aboriginals do not benefit from this. Anecdotally I can share a bit My Aunt is Metis. They homeschooled their daughter for nearly  years because they were afraid of what their rural town school would say about her skin colour. My Aunt got that in school. Shes been refused service at restaurants for her race. Her father was an alcoholic and her mother is not only financially and emotionally abusive but is so because of Residential schooling. Not only that but there is a GOOD chance my cousin wont get things like Free University because her Grandmother the abusive mom had no birth certificate and ergo there is no way to prove that she is in fact Metis.In my English class this year we were talking about Treaty . There was a guy sitting beside me Norm. Norm is a Treaty  Cree. He pretty much schooled even the Prof a Native Studies minor on Treaty . One thing that really struck a nerve with me is that per Treaty  provisions Norm is entitled to . from the Canadian Government every year... a neat little check. Of course he had to sign some forms to even get his Treatied promise of this whopping .. It struck a nerve with me because it reminds me how absolutely archaic these laws are. . a year was something Indians I will not call them what they deserve to be were supposed to sustain off of.So a little free University for  of our population? I think we can fucking DEAL.Edit Youre asking a very difficult question friend. If youre REALLY thirsty for more audit some Native study classes. I feel like that is the absolute best advice i can give you.,CanadaPolitics,dcbn6bt,13,t5_2s4gt

In the last  years weve made slow progress on that front.  Could it have already happened if wed implemented carbon taxes to reflect the true cost of oil use?  Maybe.The difference now is that were close to the tipping point where renewables become cheaper to use than oil.  As renewable use increases the cost continues to drop and problems inhibiting their use continue to get solved.  The value proposition for oil in that scenario only works for cheap to extract oil.  Thats not the oil sands.  Investing in the oil sands is a bad call as theres a fairly limited window in which to recoup that investment.But hey if you dont believe me buy stock in Husky Suncor etc.,CanadaPolitics,dcf804e,2,t5_2s4gt

People feel like theyre disconnected from society when they see that the superrich are writing the rules in their favour.Only because of reports like this one telling people that they should be upset.In a free society other peoples wealth is not your business.This report is so intentionally misleading.  Running through their methodology summary I finally found the answer.  They include debt in their calculations.  In other words some people count as having no wealth at all or likely even negative wealth.As an organization theyre amateurs.  Having worked at Stats Can I had to laugh.  Their whole methodology summary couched in ideology came down to we found our single source added up peoples assets subtracted their debt found that we only needed to add  rich people to exceed that number!!!!!  Absolutely laughable.I would surmise that if you removed just the student debt and car loans of these poorest Canadians the numbers wouldnt even be close to resembling this.But forget that because it doesnt matter these people have no idea at all how capitalism works.gtIn the longterm if theres such concentration of wealth in the hands of just a few there will be no one left to buy the goods to keep the economy running.That is about as ignorant a statement as you can get.  There is no point where it gets to that in a free market society.  Labour is a market too and wages are driven higher in large part based on the price of the goods around you thats simplified.  And of course the price of goods around you is determined by their ability to be bought.no one left to buy the goods is high school level economic thinking.Keep in mind as well the reality is that in the not too distant past wealth was far more concentrated in the rich.  The more government colludes with business rather than having free and open markets the more certain markets are monopolized the more the wealth is concentrated.  The clear and obvious answer to this issue proven by our own past is to increase market competition by pulling government out of business.For instance.  Galen Weston mentioned in this article as  of these rich people owns presidents choice.  PC is huge in the food industry.  Massive.  Do you know how much government controls that industry?  We actually have supply management and work through the biggest businesses.  Im not nearly educated enough on the agrifood file but I would suggest that yet again government has created a huge pileup of wealth.But of course we know the answer.  Wealth redistribution.  It says so right in the article.Take it.  Just take whatever you want.  Steal the money from people who have broken no laws in obtaining their wealth.I am serious when I say this report serves no purpose other than to push socialism.  It is as I mentioned a garbage writeup.  The authors have no expertise in this field clearly.This is a partisan report intended to rile people up over things generally and intended to lead people by the nose towards socialism.I mean It also suggested raising the proportion of government spending on public services and social protection.This is precisely the kind of report that every socialist and communist regime in the world loves to pump out.  Preying on peoples hatred of seeing people more successful than themselves.  Ignoring social mobility.  Ignoring freedom.Tear down the rich instead of allow everyone to build themselves up.It also relies on the illiterate notion that the economy is a zero sum game.

If we as a country can produce something cheaper than the EU and they can produce something else cheaper than us it makes sense for us all to specialize so that we import the thing the EU is more efficient at while shifting our production to the first thing and exporting it.

I think you are correct that land tax would help stop the out of control speculation and make rent seeking slightly less valuable however renting housing and speculation on housing prices are still part of a properly functioning market.Id also be curious to see how this would affect urban sprawl and development. I would imagine having a flat additional federal or provincial land tax would encourage concentrated urban development as more value can be gained per unit land but that would have less of an effect on land speculation and housing bubbles than a tax that scaled with value.

10717204,0,t1_ddku8gh,I was a kid when the first PRIDE parade happened but within my own memories I recall my uncle and godfather got put in the hospital while leaving a bar one night and I can recall the police doing very little if anything at the time to bring them justice.  The fact that the police are willing to march with the community shows how far we have come.  While my uncle and godfather passed away in the early nineties I think they would be proud that the community has had the courage to work on forgiving the police and the police have been making honest and fair efforts to work on healing the wounds they have caused.  PRIDE is about having courage and being who you are and these tactics by PRIDE BLM and now the police chief are spineless. It is disappointing. ,CanadaPolitics,ddlef10,3,t5_2s4gt

10731831,0,t1_ddmiyg8,gtBut shes a radical fighting for a radical cause.This is what makes her important but its also what makes her a terrible leader for the movement.My opinion is that a social movement often needs a sort of good cop bad cop dynamics to it where one prominent member of the movement goes off the deep end while another member is the official leader and reasonablelikable person.  Kind of like the dynamics of Malcolm X and MLK.  Shes much more in the mold of a Malcolm X style character which makes her a bad choice to be the mainstream leader of the movement.I believe that to be successful a socialpolitical movement needs to use psychological anchoring techniques to pull the consensus towards their position.  That requires not just being on the moral high ground but having a few members who takes one for the team and go off the deep end on the other side.  Khogali is doing that by going extremist so now we need another leader to take the reins and pull the national consensus towards the mainstream opinion of the BLM movement.  If the BLM fails to come up with another leader then the movement risks being seen in a similar light as the Black Panthers and not only lose credibility but become their own worst enemy.gtIve heard the I can agree with equality but why do they have to block roads? or the If they werent so inyourface I might be more likely to agree with them arguments too many times. No wonder those that support black equality in this day and age have so many concerns when someone comes along as says you cant say that!.The people who say that are the minority who miss the point.  If the roads arent blocked and the activists arent in peoples faces the majority of the population wont realize that this is an issue.  People are very good at blocking out stuff that doesnt fit their view of the world and the way to make them notice is to shatter that world.  The people who say I can agree with equality but why do they have to block roads? dont actually agree with equality.  At best they like the idea of equality but consider it to be a reasonable sacrifice if they can have their road.  These are not the people who are going to help the movement anyway so I dont think addressing their objection should be a concern.The people that we want are those who are annoyed about the roads being blocked but then realizes why the roads are being blocked and why we need to fix it.

What the CBC did was clearly illegal under our laws covering hate speech. It was unethical even if that cannot be proven.Just because they may run afoul of said law does not mean the law is flawed. It may be flawed in his opinion because he doesnt support the criminalization of hate speech. That however is a different debate over the merits of hate speech laws one which we should have. Nothing the CBC did here engenders people to the idea that we could do without these laws or that we should simply ignore their conduct because they lacked intent to cause harm or its the CBC.

Okay let me rephrase that there arent enough people up here who would vote conservative. The North is more religious and has an older population base than average and therefore there is a considerable base of socially conservative political views but the way it always has been and always will be up here is that economic issues trump the social ones and the union power and membership among the northern workforce suggests that that conservatives will never have a shot at any more than half of the seats at most both federally or provincially. Additionally with the gun registry gone there just arent any social issues remaining for these northern social conservatives to deem being worth sacrificing their labourprounion views for.Citybycity Sudbury Timmins and Thunder Bay dont have the whitecollar or agricultural labour markets necessary for conservative victories Thunder Bays taste of recent conservatism was when longtime Paul MartinLiberal Joe Comuzzi crossed the floor and that made him ridiculously unpopular up there. Ive lived in Sudbury for most of my life the rest in SSM and the numbers that conservatives post in both ridings at both levels of government are flat out embarrassing. Timmins economy is  based on gold mining and for every white collar individual there are  bluecollar ones. No hope for Conservatives there.Sault Ste Marie and North Bay are a bit more Conservative. Mike Harris has had a lasting effect in North Bay due to all of the development he funded there overfunded North Bay underfunded the rest of the north as Premier. Bryan Hayes however may have killed conservatism forever in SSM when he made a huge spectacle about all of the funding more or less bailout money he secured for Essar Steel immediately followed by Essar Steel almost going bankrupt and making mass labour cuts.There just isnt a base for the federal conservatives in the North. the provincial PCs are a bit different but even when Mike Harris first got elected he only secured  of the  seats that existed at the time.,CanadaPolitics,de642ev,2,t5_2s4gt

10977380,0,t1_de7909f,I do believe in infrastructure spending when using the strict economic definition of the term. I define infrastructure as a good which gives broad benefits by reducing frictions in economic transaction. This can be through networks of transportation communication distribution financial institutions etc.Via this definition investing in infrastructure which creates longterm productivity gains justifies debt in the shortterm because over the long run we come out ahead. If we spend  billion building an airport and pay interest on that debt for total cost of . billion but the year benefit is  billion then that was a good investment.PM Trudeaus infrastructure spending doesnt meet my definitions. If you scroll down to the infrastructure heading lets examine . billion for public transport is excellent and I wish it was higher. . billion for water management for First Nations is also good. It isnt huge productivity gains but First Nations really need more investment so this one is good too.  billion for clean water falls into roughly this same category  ok but nothing amazing.  million for climate change mitigation has the possibility to be good but it really depends on the details. What kind of things count as climate change mitigation? If the money is going to heat pumps or local solar cells that could be good but if it goes to electric vehicle parking stalls that is not so good.  million for supporting municipal capacitybuilding  I have no clue what that vague jargon is supposed to mean.  million for cultural and recreation sounds like hockey rinks and gazebos. Absolutely no long run productivity gains here.  early learning and childcare seems to be money for building childcare facilities. More childcare spaces would be great but the government doesnt need to be involved in this. Daycare costs are high because demand is high and supply is limited. The answer is reduced regulation on daycare providers so that more private individuals can open their own daycare spaces. Less bureaucratic costs and no need to spend public money on this. . billion on social infrastructure for First Nations  once again this jargon is completely opaque to me no clue what this is supposed to mean. . billion on affordable housing. Affordable housing is good but it isnt infrastructure. It isnt reducing frictions in the housing market it is subsidizing housing. Take a look at this article where mayors talk about their major infrastructure needs. Its mostly public transit with Halifax being the outlier wanting water systems. Public transit is one of the greatest infrastructure investments  it has high accessibility for lowincome individuals enables spaceefficient transportation for large numbers of people and it reduces vehicles on the road so it improves the usability of other infrastructure like roads ihghways  bridges and tunnels. There should be WAY more public transit investment. In that second article Vancouver wants . billion Calgary wants  billion Toronto wants . billion and Montreal wants . billion. That is JUST for public transit and ONLY  cities in Canada. Well Trudeau is only providing . billion so that just isnt gonna happen. I want to see like  billion earmarked only for public transit and even more for other infrastructure needs  particularly the state of roads. Long story short Im an economist who absolutely LOVES infrastructure spending.

11263228,0,t1_df8lcip,gt I think the latter is a valid reason but the former two are not. The rights of a refugee dont exist unless we all guarantee them. We should address our grievances with other countries that are not upholding their end of the bargain rather than with the refugees themselves.We cant guarantee acceptance. Sometimes the persecution theyre fleeing is in fact because they broke laws that would have them end up in jail in Canada. Blanket acceptance for everyone making a refugee claim is simply idiotic. gtIf you have the right to flee but theres nowhere to go do you really have the right to flee? And we only have control over our own actions so if we are interested in guaranteeing that people have that right we have to take that action ourselves whether we can afford to or not.Great so we cant afford it but we keep taking in refugees. Soon the country collapses and we spread out as refugees to fuck over the next country who cant refuse us.gtYes and this has always been the excuse and the reason why refugees find it difficult to even find anyone who will accept them. Protecting people from war has to be done altruistically unfortunately. Were not trying to get a labor force of refugees. Its great if they work but thats not the primary reason for accepting them.Its simply unsustainable to take them in and to try and take all of them will collapse the country if not through the economic strife of trying to finance all of them then through civil discord.gtYes I think refugees should stay in the first country that will guarantee their safety but if theyre turned away or if that country changes its mind they absolutely should have the right to look elsewhere rather than being forced back to their home country.The USA hasnt turned them down yet and once again national sovereignty is a massively important thing to be respected and national borders are a huge part of it. As far as Im concerned theyre shopping around for the best deal instead of fleeing war.gtIf you refuse refugees that are already in the country for arbitrary reasons like quotas that is very unsafe for those involved. Isnt it reasonable for them to be worried about that?Sure but they should also understand that a nation has the right to turn them down if they cant or wont afford it. Nations should take them if they can and want to but should never be forced to.gtIf Im fleeing persecution in Somalia and the US government decides to send me back to Somalia because the new government doesnt want as many refugees that could easily be a death sentence for me. Its perfectly reasonable for me to try to seek out another safe country before that happens.Well there seem to be enough people who manage to live in Somalia without having death sentences. The West isnt responsible for saving every life in the rest of the world.gtTheyre not claiming persecution by the US government their claim is still based on their original refugee claim that they made to the US. They no longer feel that the US will keep their promise so theyve decided to ask us instead. Pretty risky thing to do.It is since we should be deporting them.gtFurthermore we cant necessarily just send them back to the US. Once theyve left the US does have the right to refuse them. They would be deported back to their country of origin.Precisely because everyone wants to discourage country shopping.,CanadaPolitics,df8o59c,1,t5_2s4gt

Michael Ignatieff observes in The Warriors Honor  that our moral obligations are strongest to those closest to us.gt In practice the claims of ethical universalism came to be strongly limited in Christian teaching and then in European natural law by the injunction that a rich man had a merely voluntary and thus weaker charitable obligation to strangers in need. In more general terms a descending order of moral impingement came into place the claims of kith and kin first then neighbors coreligionists cocitizens and only at the very end the indeterminate stranger. To this day the claim of the stranger  the victim on the TV screen  is the furthest planet in the solar system of our moral obligations.Within society I definitely agree that equality is better. But I think the author of this article is saying that theres a close connection between the welfare state and ethical universalism which I dont believe is the case at all. Were not responsible for the wellbeing of the entire world to anywhere near the same degree that  were responsible for the wellbeing of fellow Canadians much less to the degree that we bear responsibility for the wellbeing of family.

11320315,0,t1_dfej4t9,gtFrench culture concentrates much more on society than Anglophone culture which concentrates on the individual.The survey Potter cited actually proves exactly the opposite. According to most common measures of social capital Quebec lags behind the rest of the country. This phenomenon has been observed in other studiesgt... the level of trust in Canada rises as one moves away from the centre and towards both west and east coasts and that the trust levels are alarmingly low for cities in the province of Quebec.... within Canada Quebec appears as an anomaly given the extremely low levels of trust in cities located in this province. Also within Quebec Montreal seems to be in a class all by itself showing the unusual combination of high diversity and low trust. Quebec also has the lowest rates of volunteering and charitable contributions of any part of CanadagtThe rate of volunteering and donating varies across Canada. In  the volunteer rate was highest in Saskatchewan  and Manitoba . Both were significantly higher than the national average of . In contrast the rate of volunteering was lowest in Qubec where about onethird  of the population aged  and over volunteered for an organization. Quebec was also the only province with an average number of volunteer hours below the national average.Finally Quebecers especially in Montreal have lower levels of trust in institutions than most of the rest of CanadagtResidents of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick tended to have aboveaverage confidence in most institutions while residents of Quebec and British Columbia tended to have belowaverage confidence in institutions.Perhaps the explanation here is that Quebecers tend have a more statist political culture than English Canadians and consequently rely less on civil society and more on the government.

And Im not just talking about the sponsorship scandal either. The other parties have had issues with things like that as well. The Tories and NDP meanwhile have had issues stemming from lack of party discipline regarding airing views on cultural or social matters well outside of the mainstream leading to very bad press. The Reform Party in the s had TONS of issues with that so much so that they developed a name for it bozo eruptions and the NDP sometimes on the provincial level has been embarrassed by things like praise of Hugo Chavez or brush ups with militant feminism. The Harper Conservatives basically put gag orders on their members almost at all times to cut down on excuses for media attacks from party members sharing their honest views.

Trying to achieve parity with them is going to be a pointless endeavour.Where Canada can stand out and has stood out as a good country for scientific research is promoting and funding the kind of basic science that doesnt get funded by private investors and institutes and going out of our way to ensure that yes our work has higher purity than those of other countries increasing respect and trust for our researchers and institutions in the hundreds of fields and disciplines that we work in. Personally I would rather leave my field of research behind find work somewhere else than compromise the quality or veracity or appearance of quality or veracity of my work by putting myself in a position where my funding was dependant on finding certain results.

The politics of it are less good as even though it helps improve traffic everywhere by getting UBC students off the road it gets perceived as Vancouver specific.The Surrey LRT project is less good. Translinks own analysis showed LRT is not the correct mode of transit here and offers poor value for money. For th Avenue and King George the two routes funded in this phase demand is not sufficient to justify LRT and LRT offers no improvements in travel times or ridership over BRT which could be built at a fraction of the cost and could be built with possible future conversion to LRT if desired.Along Fraser Highway second phase of LRT and not yet funded demand is actually too high for at grade LRT. LRT again would offer no improvements on speed or ridership compared to BRT and the route has sufficient demand to justify extending the Skytrain network instead basically the Scarborough RT but without the turning radius problems that prevent new vehicles from being purchasedmade.A combined BRT on  and King George and Skytrain on Fraser Highway system would also could also be built for the same cost as a LRT and attract twice as many riders with  min shorter travel times for commuters on Fraser Highway. This is Alternative  in the report.So why do LRT? Because you can sell condos based on future LRT much more easily than based on future BRT and developers fund pretty much all the municipal politicians in Vancouver.The sad thing is you could take the basic concept of LRT in Surrey and swap it with Scarboroughs transit plan and visa versa and get better results for both.,CanadaPolitics,dfnqi2e,14,t5_2s4gt

I dont think this is a fair expectation based on the reality and history of immigration to Canada and in other western countries. Incoming adult immigrants will likely never identify as Canadian and may never fluently speak English  theyre primary identity will always be with their country of origin. Likewise they will always settle with people of their own group which is why various ethnic enclaves have existed for over  years.What we care about is their children who are born here or are here from a very young age. The marker of success should be how Canadian these individuals feel in their identity and I think we do a very good job of that especially relative to places like France where you could be the third generation born in France but will never be considered French but rather Arab Algerian etc.. Relating to the Syrians difficulties should not be surprising nor should it be surprising that they huddle within other ethnic communities.,CanadaPolitics,dgmh2uv,3,t5_2s4gt

This is getting to be annoying. Thats exactly how you would consider it too if you had to make such a choice. You were getting a certain amount of money and then the government took some away because you worked. Does he or does he not get an increase of  before subtracting other costs for an entire year of work?The guy whos losing  cents for every dollar he earns doesnt care for your emotional descriptions. Hes getting  cents less and thats all he cares about. Even if we all thought about it your way the numbers dont change.To reiterate with the  with no strings attached nonsense for the third time we are not talking about what happens with vs without this program. We are talking about with this program in place with its  clawback rate is there a discouraging effect on minimum wage work?gtYeah this reads like a person who has never tried paying rent on minimum wage wrote it. You save money when you are poor. You pack a sandwich for lunch. You take the bus...Oh great. I guess theres no issue then. sIts entirely possible that workrelated costs would be that high. You cant just say theyre poor so they wont spend money. It doesnt work that way. Taking the bus in Ottawa would cost . per day. Thats . of your jobs effective aftertax income. Riding a bike means you need to own a bike and maintain it and eat more food because you used calories biking. Packing a lunch can cost slightly more than eating at home. Being presentable for your job costs money for clothes and haircuts. People this poor need to count the cents they use when boiling water for ramen so every bit of these workrelated costs needs to be counted. Some people need cars because they live too far away from where they work. You cant handwave away these costs. Whether theyre  or  or  theyre a considerable portion of their  a day salary that weve established.Look I didnt invent the concept of a welfare trap. Its a mainstream idea. This program is an example of one. You seem to be disputing the entire concept. Are you saying you know better than economists who have though about this a lot longer and harder than you have?Would you work two bucks an hour? I seriously doubt you would when you were getting k per year anyway. You are the one that isnt thinking about this the way an unemployed person would. Even poor people value their time. Poor people have dignity too. Do you know about utility? If the net utility of having to wake up early commute back and forth working all day and getting . minus workrelated costs is less than the utility of being able to sleep in and stay home theyll stay home. It possible that some people might value their time low enough and take the mimimumwage job. Maybe those people really need that extra bit of cash. But you cant seriously believe that this wont discourage people from working.,CanadaPolitics,dgpusno,1,t5_2s4gt

It wont be a great solution for the U.S. economy.So youre saying that the tariff will push the US to cut lumber deals with Russia and will put pressure on US lawmakers to establish more permissive rules concerning clearcutting of federal lands as well as privateheld land.
