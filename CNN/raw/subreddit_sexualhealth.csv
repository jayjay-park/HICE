After a few weeks of daily stretching I started to see some results though because my situation was so extreme a mm pinhole opening it took about a year until I could retract. You can start with your GP. She will prescribe you betamethasone cream which is supposed to help with the process. The cream is not essential. The important part is the frequent stretching using the correct method.Ive gathered all the information together for you on my blog,sexualhealth,cyk8zx8,2,t5_2r09b

Well generics are the same drugs as those with patent they have same active ingredient but brand Viagra has a patent and after its expiration it is allowed to sell generics but with a much lower prices. I took both of them and to be honest cannot see the reason to pay more. On  I found the most suitable for me.,sexualhealth,dcsfhwy,1,t5_2r09b
