4296906,0,t3_3a4dnd,Good for you! Im glad to hear it went well better. I wouldnt say that your way is necessarily better. You could have had a map with no early opponents but with opponents that will certainly have large armies. Your early resources could have been undefended and closeby with sparse other resources.. In this case its much better to grab a few economy structures before getting your th and th hero building rush structures.,MightandMagicHeroes,cs9zfvf,1,t5_38nub
4562612,0,t3_3dj90h,I played it for a few hours. Unfortunately it was pretty buggy which they had stated would be the case. I would call it a late alpha  early beta myself. Definitely lots to improve upon.That being said it reminded me a lot of H which was one of my favorites of the franchise. It felt like the spiritual successor to that with some amenities of H thrown in.They are very open in their development process on their website and I really like the direction they are taking the game. Im honestly nervous that the game will be still buggy come September when they plan to release. Id like to see them push it back another couple of months and really make this the amazing game it has the potential to be.,MightandMagicHeroes,ct5qegg,8,t5_38nub
