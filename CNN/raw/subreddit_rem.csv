5270901,0,t3_3n6y8t,I was watching this performance for the first time in a few years when about halfway through I suddenly realized today was the th anniversary!EDIT Also of interest is their second performance at Rockaplast in   years and two months later.,rem,cvlf0pw,2,t5_2s98s
5496352,0,t1_cwe6pdb,Thats ok the band seemed to have checked out on ATS as well.  Its got maybe two songs that I would say are meh while the rest are balls.  If I were you Id definitely get my hands on Accelerate and Collapse.  Or stream them or do whatever the kids do these days when they arent buying CDs.,rem,cwe7m1h,2,t5_2s98s
5947808,0,t3_3uyc87,I love Up. Its really great for falling asleep. The songs are great. Its called Up but its very mellow. But IMO this is their best of the later years without Bill Berry. And actually for me it was better than the ones leading up to it. Id say it was their best album of the s. And thats saying a lot because they had some great stuff in the s. So yeah I really like it. But I usually skip over track  Hope. ,rem,cxzadm0,2,t5_2s98s

9432734,0,t3_59ufso,Id start with something with a few songs you may be familiar with or have heard before like Document Green Out of Time or Automatic then go from there.  Fables of the Reconstruction was one the first R.E.M. albums I ever bought and it was really good I was unfamiliar with any of the songs on it at the time but it was so good and it introduced me to their early material which is really good as well.,rem,d9bnx2p,2,t5_2s98s

10584173,0,t3_5rickv,Michael Stipe frequently introduced both Fall On Me and Country Feedback as his favorite R.E.M. songs so its a little hard for me to think of either of them as being under rated.,rem,dd7ocf8,8,t5_2s98s
10585450,0,t3_5rickv,Laughing off of Murmur is my absolute favourite track of theirs and its almost never mentioned. Such a strange yet very warm sounding song.,rem,dd7t39p,10,t5_2s98s
