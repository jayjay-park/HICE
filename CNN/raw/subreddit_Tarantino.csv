6057105,0,t1_cydjsw8,You seem to be wellspoken and eloquent when speaking on the subject so Id like to ask about why IB is considered Tarantinos masterpiece.

6623543,0,t1_d04fam3,Shortly before they shoot the floor when the sound starts its so oppressive. I have seen that scene  times and I always feel it. Its not a good feeling.

6707114,0,t3_47b7ed,Eh it was more of everytime I asked somebody for a good casual watch theyd say PF. I usually check out the synopses of films I cant find the time to watch but somehow reading the high accolades and praise I did not and proceeded to see it. The rest is history.Im a mushroomcloud layin motherfucker motherfucker! RD   My second favorite Tarantino flick. Madsen delivered some of the most intense acting Ive seen. Torturing someone sadistically is one thing doing it over the ambient music of Stuck in the Middle w you is quite anotherPF  in the AMJB .  Horribly slow at least for me. Picked up the pace later on thoughKB   IB    Christoph Waltz and the Basterds. Pretty entertaining as a take on alternative historyDU   Christoph Waltz TH    Not as slow paced for me as others seem to think. I felt the characters were pretty entertaining Tim Roth clearly doing a Christoph Waltz impersonation and Madsen the gravelly voice when really all of them are really ruthless villains who came for to free JJL. Also I didnt see the imdb page so Tatums entrance was quite a twistspoiler,Tarantino,d0d2nbc,1,t5_2ti9n

7882912,0,t3_4n976z,Yes. You see him getting weaker over time. In addition hes limping and falling unconscious. Its his selfcalled first and final act as Sheriff of Redrock to sentence Daisy to death. Between hanging her and reading the letter hes got no power left so the last thing he does is reading the letter.Everyone in this movie dies and there is no reason Mannix should be an exception.,Tarantino,d42421a,10,t5_2ti9n
