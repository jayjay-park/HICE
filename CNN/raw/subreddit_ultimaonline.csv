177423,0,t3_1w4c3a,No mounts is a bad idea and its why no shard without mounts survives for long. Nobody enjoys the pvp.Mounts have limited stamina cant be refreshed without dismounting and you cant remount in combat. This puts a hard limit on travel distance while pvping. It was always so satisfying on OSI to chase a dying person and have them hop off their mount which you then attacked leaving them helpless for you to deliver the killing blow.Unmounted people can refresh stamina on the run which causes cross map marathons.It also unbalances more than just pvp. Stealth is a very strong skill but the downside is that you have to be dismounted to stealth. Without nobody mounted stealth is overpowered.Teleport chained together travels faster than a player on foot but slower than a mounted player.,ultimaonline,ceyn5mw,-6,t5_2qtmf

You have been a part of one server that you let fail and be run into the ground Rel Por and now you are part of a server that has THREE TIMES failed and the staff let it be run into the ground.  People are blind if they think you are not going to do the same here.  You personally have a  track record and An Corp is on a  track record.  I have no doubt you guys are going to bring that to a  combined track record in no time flat!Meanwhile we are still going strong after nearly  years.  Whats that about right???  What are we doing right that you obviously do not have the skill or talent to do?  I think this is the big picture people are missing.  You guys are complete failures and will continue to fail.How many times have you guys crushed the hopes of UO players around the globe?  I would argue that the current state of free shards is mainly due to some of the larger shards flakeyness.  How can you argue against that even?  You guys create these shards let people build up there stuff for a year then stop developing it.  You then set it on a crash course into a mountain and relaunch at a later date.  This causes people to become disenchanted with UO!  Rel Por IPY IPY and UOAC ARE ALL GUILTY OF THIS. And what do you mean UOAC isnt copying anything?

At any rate this is all opinion and conjecture there are no facts being tossed around here just overzealous comments. Clearly you do not like this specific mechanic which is fine disagreeing with it is fine. personally attacking the people who spent time and effort coding the feature is over the top there is no need to act in such an abhorring way. There are plenty of ways to get your point across more clearly than inserting a personal insult in every line because at the end of the day the insults you fling will be the things that are scrutinised most by the people you want to read your comment. Its counterproductive and youre only diminishing your own voice and devaluing your own opinion.I for one do not like the idea of perma stat loss there are plenty of ways to implement punishments but punishments in general go against my core beliefs of game development  I wouldnt code something in to the game that isnt fun in at least some aspect. What if the punishments were fun too? Perma stat loss could be fun if you want your stats back you have to pay the person you killed to get them back? Or perhaps give the dead player a gold income boost or something? Perma stat loss with the way I understand it to be is like sending a person to jail for murder and then not letting them eat to survive. As for the victim justice is served but thats not usually enough to make them feel better so why not give them some compensation?If deterring gameplay as red is something that needs to be achieved might as well remove reds completely IMO.

I view it as elaborating clarifying or just plain old discussing the change.  You asked the question in your post what is the actual difference? I was replying and elaborating the difference. There genuinely is a shift in combat strategy because of the ability. For some its an improvement. For others its messing with something they didnt want messed with. Sorry if the replies are rubbing you the wrong way not my intention. ,ultimaonline,d3v85b7,2,t5_2qtmf

8924646,0,t3_52ig1i,If your interested in playing an AOS shard I welcome you to check out Ultima Shards.We currently have the AOS shard released but we are known as being a Multiverse which means well add separate shards for TA UOR and ML later on once AOS has enough content ready.You can visit the website HEREYou can also join our Discord ChatLastly to download the game and everything we offer an allinone Installer Patcher Launcher IPL. You can download that HereAs far as your questions. To counter paralyze you can purchase pouches and magic trap them then use a macro to open them as soon as your paralyzed. This will deal damage to you but free you from paralyze right away. You can also precast a spell with delay and minimum damage like Magic Arrow and cast it on yourself before you get paralyzed. In AOS if your Resist is the same as your attackers Eval you will not take any paralyze freeze time.UOSteam is a great macro assistant that allows you to macro things like self heal that would essentially heal yourself a bit faster than you ever could yourself and if your poisoned it will automatically cast cure on yourself when hitting the heal self hotkey macro.Magery is basically the best for survivability if you learn how to play your class well but probably the biggest survivability template is a  Chiv Dexxer. Which means you have the fastest heals can easily cure Deadly Poison and can remove any curses anyone inflicts on you. You can use this template with a weapon skill. So a DP  Chiv Dexxer is an amazing template and if your opponent doesnt have Cure Potions you will do some devastating damage and will be extremely tough to kill.Hope to see you on and our community will definitely answer any questions you may have I can as well.Cheers!Punkte,ultimaonline,d7km0yv,3,t5_2qtmf

Just seems like common reddiquette is largely ignored on this sub so it seems like the mods of this sub also dont really care.. Hence my question. Do you really care or are you just with this particular server?  Reddit allows you to buy ad space btw. Might be a better idea to use that.,ultimaonline,d8ap9z4,1,t5_2qtmf

9416388,0,t3_55gtpx,Thats a lot of information that you expect to be condensed into a worthwhile read but Ill do my best although Im sure there will be some gaps of time missing.I dabbled a bit in preTA gradually playing more during TA before wholly diving in shortly after UOR was released. As with most Atlantic was my home for several years managing to cobble together the thenlargest guild on the shard Grandmasters of Destruction. Before that guild disbanded I cofounded the nextlargest Guardians of Virtue. On occasion I would play on other official shards for the sake of moving assets i.e. advertising eBay listings for houses characters etc but never strayed too far.Shortly thereafter I became caught up in the frenzy that was RunUO in early so ending my time with the official UO community. My baptism by fire in the free shard community came by way of older servers like Splintered Reality partaking in the ongoing development of those communities eventually opting to remain a player and investing a shit load of time into a once extremely popular server by the name of Excelsior. I later accepted a development position with the evererratic Orbsydia project before spearheading its revival as OrbUO only to resign due to conflict of interest as a result of launching my own community that mustered a strong three years before finally settling on freelance work and touring the community even getting fun welcome parties like I did on UO Renaissance  thanks Chris!.There is far too much history and an even greater list of names that would take much too many walls of text to cover with any proper respect but ultimately its been one hell of a ride over the last  years. I havent been active in the UO community at all since mid only peeking at this subreddit and interacting with topics of interest.At times I feel a sense of guilt for abandoning the community that has given me so many friendships and wonderful experiences but truthfully Im just exhausted. Emulation while a blessing for the game and its fans is a brutal journey that saps your soul for as much good there has been ample bad. I simply havent the interest in going back to the official servers for a myriad of reasons cost time design account deletion and probably most of all wanton incompetence. At heart Ill always love this game and may find time for one more foray into the wilds but for now Im happy with the memories.Thank you Ultima Online.,ultimaonline,d99lchi,2,t5_2qtmf

10385968,0,t1_dcl3ykd,gt The core design was not fine though.. The core design was the whole item loss nonconsensual pvp system crafting means something and sandbox gameplay. Just like EVE except they did murder balance completely different.Being able to para gank in a group then gate to your house and never have any problem with blues or guards was a balance problem.A more specific reason the core design was good. Item loss existed pvp stimulated item loss therefore items actually mattered and crafterseconomy works. Notice how in any game professionscrafting is complete horse shit or the economy is basically trading rares? Thats because the core design is a completely different type of game that doesnt allow them to function properly. Both types are fine for gameplay WoW Vs EVEUO just need correct balance. ,ultimaonline,dclbbb9,1,t5_2qtmf
10398217,0,t1_dcmk43n,Actually the definition of a voxel fits the context of UOgt in computerbased modelling or graphic simulation each of an array of elements of volume that constitute a notional threedimensional space especially each of an array of discrete elements into which a representation of a threedimensional object is divided.The tile matrix I glossed over in another reply is exactly what is described above though the data is extrapolated in a D rendering engine to give it the illusion of D. Simply put the tile matrix can be represented in code like thisTilesWidthHeightDepth  X Y Z HEach voxel can be accessed using TilesxyzThe data usually attached to each entry in the tile matrix is more than just the XYWH  it includes behaviour flags rendering flags etc.The client renders them based on their neighbours attributes as you can see in the previous screenshots this involves stretching and skewing the assets to achieve.There are screenshots on the UO Facebook group from a couple of years back where one person had extrapolated the height maps and tile matrix in order to generate a fully D rendering of the UO world it was pretty neat.When I coded object collision detection for vehicles on my shard I had to create a voxel matrix of the multi ship components for intersection detection. This involved representing each component with an X Y Z and Height attribute.,ultimaonline,dcmpd5d,2,t5_2qtmf

As far as your builds go what server are you thinking of? Are you playing official servers? I dont know anything about them since the game is totally different now. I play uo Renaissance and enjoy it. Its going to be hard to get away with no magic since that means you cant get around with recall spell or scrolls and runes. Youre also going to be an easy target for pkers with those builds if youre exploring solo. But hey you can make any build work and its all about strengths and weaknesses so have fun!
