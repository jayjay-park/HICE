4979075,0,t3_3j3344,Ivue has a set list of xml files that you can choose from by default. It also has an option for a custom option. That is where you would need to go to for customization. There are several apps that allow you to generate an xml file. Webgrab plus is highly popular but the configuration can be very frustrating. There is also mcxml and zapxml.I use zapxml. You register an account at zapit create a custom favorite list of channels and then use zapxml to pull your  day guide xml file. Now you only get one shot at this a week and zapit caches your pull.The next step would be making sure Ivue has support for the addon that youre pulling you channel from. If it doesnt youll need to put that stream in your favorites and add it to Ivue that way. You can also create custom strm files and do it that way if you know the url of the stream.Also note that youll have either manually pull new guide info each week or run the script on cron or windows scheduler depending on your OS. If youre using an Android based box youll also have to upload that file to the storage device on that. If you have the device on your network you should be good to go.,IPTV,cum5emy,2,t5_2scyp

10292448,0,t3_5ncgm7,The short answer is that with a Mbps connection your issue is the quality of free services.  If free services provided consistent quality then the subscription services would cease to exist.I second stokedcrf that smoothstreams provides a quality sports focused service at a premium price.  If you are looking for a mixture of sports and entertainment channels then RapidIPTV would be a better option.,IPTV,dcapdqc,1,t5_2scyp
10356024,0,t1_dchq7n5,At  to Mbps  in a month thats between TB and TB...Multiply by that  channels thats  to TB per month multiply that again by  because the streams have to come into the server and then go out to one client thats TB to TB...And thats just for one people watching the streams in a case where he watches ... In any case with such bitrates you are definitely looking at something starting between TB to TB of used bandwidth.Bandwidth like that doesnt come cheap even if you are willing to pay  a month.,IPTV,dchwz1j,1,t5_2scyp

Although with kodi youll lose all the vod and extra features and possibly the epg wont work. Those issues are covered in many other posts so I wont get into it.But yes kodi should be able to at least stream the channels but because its not a supported device and the plugin is in beta you probably wont get any tech support from any resellers.

Also both flawless and vader had epg on smart tv using the mu playlist at all times. Again Im no troubleshooting expert but it seems that it has something to do with the device  maybe not stalker vs non stalker or t vs other STBs though,IPTV,dg47bc7,1,t5_2scyp

Wife complains about once a week with it which is good for her usual level of complaining . Oscars was choppy and she was pissed. No pussy for me that week. ,IPTV,dgaqsmo,1,t5_2scyp
11617875,0,t1_dgcqlp2,I have  different rokus and obviously a f load of dreamlinks. Some providers support the roku now and some people are in the process of making emulators for the roku too. Roku is a closed ecosystem though kinda like apple. Youre going to find it very restricting. If its tv you want avoid thr roku at all Costs. I used to use machtv and stuff with my roku and it was a horrible expensive experience. With the dreamlink youll have thr ability to use many many more servers at half the cost of say machtv. Additionally the process of adding roku channels is an extra hoop to jump though. In some cases I had to be on whatsapp with the reseller showing him screenshots of what was on my. Tv to activate... And if he didnt respond fast enough it timed out. Wow those were the days glad thats in the past lol,IPTV,dgcwaa8,1,t5_2scyp
11629857,0,t1_dgdya0i,The work with a beta version of the stalker Pvr client which support has now deceased for. Yes it works if you know what you are doing but isnt officially supported and likely will not be. Also you miss out on all the vod content which is a big bonus on these providers because their content is extensive. Additionally timeshitfting youd have to do without as well. ,IPTV,dge998e,1,t5_2scyp

11797423,0,t1_dgwohom,Well the thing is... With Netflix your system can buffer an almost unlimited amount thereby giving you the impression its better. With live IPTV you dont have the benefit of being able to endlessly buffer. Theres only a small amount you can buffer. So if the connection to your ISP has high latency I could see that affecting it. So if anyone else is using the internet for downloadstreaming it will likely cripple it.What do you use for a router? Is it seperate from the modem? Two boxes. To test if your router is causing grief plug your IPTV device directly into the modem no router. Set the IPTV network settings to Autodhcp. You will need to reboot the IPTV box and also likely reboot the modem. Does this work better for you?? If so then we know the issue begins with the router. If the issue persists its either the modem or ISP routing problem because when youre connected directly to the modem you have no interference from other devices. The other thing I was thinking was perhaps you have NAT or the firewall enabled on both the modem and router and that causes problems for sure double NAT. The firewall and NAT should run on your router not the modem. Its best to have the modem in  bridge modeas this turns it into a basic dumb modem with all other features disabled which is what we want.,IPTV,dgxa0xv,1,t5_2scyp
