There arent many options for loops other than betty gap loop. But that runs on the conasauga river trail and crosses a bunch. You could go in tearbritches and then go up the panther creek trail to the east cowpen trail. Panther creek is a decent climb. Dropping a car wouldnt be too hard on that. You could also take east cowpen trail to beech bottom trail. That would only require one crossing I think. But the car drop on that would be kind of a pain. Any further east and you are going to be in the area that burned this fall which could be neat to see but I dont even know if that area is open. ,CohuttaWilderness,dckz98q,3,t5_3130x
