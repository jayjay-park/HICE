1662476,0,t3_2de4c6,Ive wondered this myself as they have a super powered farm hand that can do pretty much all the work in  minutes and dont need to hire any workers.Maybe they have shitty insurance and have to pay for the trucks they constantly destroy and replace.If Mr. Kent wasnt such a prick to lex early the farm would be doing well and hed at least have taken the money for all the poisoned cows.I honestly believe that in smallville continuity Lex would have managed to avoid a dark path had Mr. Kent not been a phenominal douchebag to lex every time he does something nice for no other reason than his family name.,Smallville,cjopu18,7,t5_2r3pi
1773164,0,t1_ck2mjr4,Tbh I thought the story evolved quite nicely both with the proposal and Lanas death and breakup and Jonathans death.Im  just really disappointed that Jonathan died and that everything is the same old with Lana and Clark,Smallville,ck2nul8,5,t5_2r3pi

6325446,0,t3_41k19a,I just rewatched this scene the other day and I think Lois tells Clark he can cut out the Ms. Lane act because no ones paying attention.I remember when the episode came out the consensus was that Lois and Clark kept trying to get married in the intervening years but much like at the end of the episode one emergency or another would pop up.,Smallville,cz8mus2,1,t5_2r3pi

7069580,0,t3_4cbhyy,Maybe I should be more specific in saying that a line you wish would have been said that wouldnt change the whole story. LolYa know like if theres a conversation going and it ends and in your head your thinking of a different line that could be used or another line that could be put in.Without changing everything.

7668741,0,t1_d3dvdos,hmm thats actually a good point. I do remember that scene. I googled the mom and some scenes it looks pretty red and in others it looks like redbrown so i dunno. But shes definitely not standard brunette.,Smallville,d3dw4k6,2,t5_2r3pi

9433310,0,t3_57s7ef,Mid season  is where they hit there stride writingwise.  The began replacing freak of the week with multiepisode character arcs and season long character arcs.  Season three is where they started diving into the superman universe and creating their own universe which is brought in full during seasons  and .  ,Smallville,d9bqk1f,1,t5_2r3pi
9481122,0,t3_5al72z,I only kind of agree.  Smallville created its own unique universe while focusing on one character and they definitely didnt have a the budget to do most of villains in the later seasons justice.  However the later seasons starting with season  really brought to life the superman universe and the best way to tell their story was creating season long character arcs.  The show in the later years was so much more than whats the problem this week okay we will solve that this week which is where I think Flash is really starting to bug me with.  Smallville included so many references to the DC universe and really hit it out of the park in seasons .  Chloe was Cisco and Felicity way before they even existed.  Regarding someone else  his character had to go when he did if not earlier.  His sole quest was discovering you know whos secret.  You know who could never move forward without dealing with someone else.  you could tell in season  it was a major wall to You know whos development.,Smallville,d9hr43f,2,t5_2r3pi

9507901,0,t3_5b0h1m,I like evil Clark. I guess like isnt the right word. I enjoyed seeing Toms acting as a bit more aggressive actor portrayal. ,Smallville,d9l1uv8,3,t5_2r3pi
9663560,0,t3_5dfzc9,I disagree with a lot of these but I guess thats the good thing about having a difference of opinion.Also I really think everyone that watches the show should really watch it all at least once and they can decide which ones they can skip in a rewatch.With that being said it is awesome of you to take the time to make up this list for people that were asking! ,Smallville,da48i7t,9,t5_2r3pi

11517951,0,t1_dg1jvk2,Not an argument. Dude not as an insult but please rewatch the episodes you seem to be mixing bit from here and there. I can understand since I rewatched many times to fully grasp it.JorEl saving Lana has nothing to do with Jonathon. Jonathon owed something to JorEl which is never mentioned since he died before he forfilled it. If JorEl wanted Jonathan to die why would he have gone after Lana amp Lois first?,Smallville,dg1k7uh,1,t5_2r3pi
