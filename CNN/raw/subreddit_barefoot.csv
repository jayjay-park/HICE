1264154,0,t1_ciblq37,Heelstriking is actually very efficient in terms of energy. The reason we dont heel strike when running is because the heel is a static structure that doesnt handle sharp impacts well but a smooth walking gait doesnt have those. Heelfirst walking is fine if the impact is too sharp youll feel it and youll adjust your gait mostly automatically.,barefoot,cibu0bg,2,t5_2r6ws

1947463,0,t3_2fk60r,Ive had two incidents at WalMart where I was told to put on shoes. My polite response? Do you think its a good idea to be harassing someone who has over time spent thousands of dollars at their particular store? And they immediately shut up and walk away. Seriously. I think WalMart has some kind of superceding policy of letting customers win. One of the times I was even buying a  dollar flat screen ON SALE!!  and the employee commented on my feet. Once I told her about my time and money previously spent in the store she told me that it was okay just dont let my manager see. The funny part came when she went and told her manager in plain sight of my girlfriend and I about it while we checked out. They still let us buy it and the miscellaneous groceries we had.America huh?,barefoot,cknvebr,1,t5_2r6ws

2258096,0,t1_clqsex3,I wore slippers in the house for a while and then I realized when I go barefoot I can really feel it if the floor needs to be swept or mopped or vacuumed so I think the house is cleaner for that. When I wore slippers even just in the house they get kinda dirty on the bottom anyway but feet you can just go rinse off in the tub. What part of Asia is your family from? I know only that Japanese Indians and probably Koreans dont bring shoes in. I wouldnt be surprised if China and South Pacific and Mongolia followed suit.  Even though we have a no shoes inside policy my roommate still walks around with his shoes because hes going out soon or something. Sigh. ,barefoot,clqtlgq,3,t5_2r6ws

7783543,0,t3_4lrplz,So glad Im not the only one who does this. Its almost like a slower version of the technique used by barefoot runners which is biomechanically way healthier than heelstriking so it stands to reason that the same would apply when walking. It makes sense lowering your body weight down with your calf muscles is far less impactful than driving your heel into the ground. Its interesting to hear people heelstriking while barefoot or in thinsoled shoes I can sometimes literally feel the ground shake as they walk by whereas my steps are deathly silent. As far as growing out of it why would you want to? I had to train myself to walk forefoot first when I first went barefoot full time but its basically second nature now. Consider yourself lucky that you naturally walk with proper technique.,barefoot,d3qx9sf,3,t5_2r6ws

Ive also walked and biked extensively through Detroit attended Tigers games had great food in Greektown and checked out the neighborhoods you mentioned. Lafayette Park is a wonderful green oasis and the Guardian Building is one of my favorites in the city. I consider it one of the most beautiful and optimistic places in the US.But its also the unavoidable sights of places like Packard Michigan Central Fisher Body and so on and Id still like to explore that aspect of the city. ,barefoot,d93r429,2,t5_2r6ws
