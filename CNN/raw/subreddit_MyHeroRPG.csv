One time we could train together in the bubble since if someone grabs me in the bubble they will also feel the negative and their muscles will react to the time passed. I hope one of our teachers is a archangel. Thatd be totally awesome! Or maybe a cameleon!!!Karayas eyes began shining and he couldnt hide his excitement as he imagined different heroes with quirks. Birdie seemed like the exact person that could be his rival. As well as a friend.,MyHeroRPG,d656a5h,1,t5_3f77g

Like most people he just seemed another stepping stone in the eyes of Ray.Ray I dont care.Ray took a few steps back so theyd start at a fair distance he reaches over to his pocket and takes out  objects  wooden sticks tipped with golden balls and a mask made out of a sheet of paper and a rubber band. He places the mask on his face it had a weird design to it it was hard to tell if it was poorly drawn or modern art.Ray slams his sticks on two of his cylinders and a blue light comes out heating up the gold on the sticks. He stands still after that waiting for his opponents next move.Ray Begin,MyHeroRPG,d67qo6o,1,t5_3f77g
