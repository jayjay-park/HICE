3645468,0,t1_cq7sbfw,Patch  Fixed a bug that was preventing about  of uniques from dropping. Corrected Shamans Affliction tooltip. It doesnt actually have a cooldown. Fixed item tooltip positioning when the window is stretched very wide. Fixed floating point values from appearing for life leech on the stat sheet. Fixed Rogues talented level  evade. It lost its stun. Clicking the Battle Reports header will now close it. Fixed multiple bugs with Magicians Elemental Fury. The frost elementals freeze effect now applies without bugging out and the skill can be used to open combat.Patch  Fixed an upgrade bug with server accounts that caused gold to sometimes go negative. Fixed and adjusted all pet resistances. They are no longer determined by level. Instead they have fixed resistance depending on what type of pet they are. Fixed a bug that caused such high resistance in some cases that some pets were healed by elemental damage. Updated Magician pet tooltips to reflect their resistance strengths. Added resist percentages to the character sheet. Limited the casting rate of all mobs below level . This should help substantially in Riven Grotto.,Nevergrind,cq7t6qj,2,t5_2vrey
