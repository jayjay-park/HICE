11160,0,t1_cefpbem,But from a production standpoint its the same just x as much.  It would unfortunately be splitting revenue streams.  Its not worth it for HASBRO and thats whats important.,MLPAnalysis,cefpee8,2,t5_2xb3o
160483,0,t3_1vxdm9,This episode is riddled with flaws. My biggest problem with this episode though was the Wonderbolts themselves. Soarin was kind respectful and an all around nice guy and I liked him. But Spitfirewe know shes arrogant already but here shes out an out flanderized. I dont like her in this and Ive never had a problem with her before. In fact I really liked her before. But here shes just got the biggest stick up her ass! Whats the matter Spittie Soarin not laying the pipe down that well recently that you want to ditch him for your side chick? Fuck off. But hey at least she was proud of RD for turning her invitation to join the Cloudsdale team down. So she wasnt completely horrible in this. Just mostly horrible. As for Fleet Foot we knew nothing about her before and I wish it would have stayed that way. Shes nothing more than a manipulative little cunt and so overdone that she took me out of the episode completely! Every time she was on the screen I wanted to reach through and strangle her! Jesus H. Christ why the flying feather is she a Wonderbolt? Please fire her and hire RD! Hell hire back Lightning Dust! Shes better than this fucking whore!Ugh just more reason for me to want the Shadowbolts to be real. Im starting to think that Nightshade would actually be both a more competent leader than Spitfire and more worthy of Dashs admiration!,MLPAnalysis,cewpn99,1,t5_2xb3o
164146,0,t1_cex07b5,Where the hoof do people keep getting A from? That is the opposite of whats going on from every angle. Twilight is believing a negative Pinkie Sense cant work in spite of evidence to the contrary and is immediately challenged with You dont believe because you dont understand. or to rephrase The only reason you dont believe is because you dont already understand. which Twilight directly admits before she writes the letter that episode via Just because I dont understand doesnt mean its not true. I dont really know how much clearer it could be without disrupting the narrative with an aside and repeating it a few times while facing the audience.,MLPAnalysis,cex4n5h,1,t5_2xb3o
177280,0,t3_1w4kk1,Heres the thing presentation matters. Its not really the spelling as much as it is absolutely everything about the way you have formatted and put your sentences together. The lack of capitalization or any punctuation or sentence structure whatsoever makes this extremely difficult to read. Unless the content of your reviews contain some extraordinary insight theres really no reason to read them as there are plenty of other reviewers that are more articulate. I guess my point is that this just doesnt stack up well compared to other things I could be spending my time reading.,MLPAnalysis,ceymkhx,4,t5_2xb3o
189086,0,t1_cezyun6,gtNot really. More like Why does one need more than five or six friends?LOL I have no idea... ask Pinkie.gtWith these things youre usually not doing something to someone to teach them a lesson theyll understand later but just because its best for for society the case of lawstaxes and best for them at that moment making sure children eat healthyget enough sleep.And is it not so for Twilight? Is it not in Societys best interest that she understand friendship to an actualized degree? Is it not best for her if she doesnt? Lest she end up like Sunset Shimmer...gtNot sure but Im not convinced thats a lesson Discord was trying to teach or for that matter that Twilight neededNot yet... But in the foreseeable future...gtI can sympathize with a sociopath I just disagree with your reading of his intentionsmasterplanAnd I disagree with your!... Disagreement... of my agreement... what was I talking about?gtI totally get that thats actually one of my major problems with KCaFO. Chaos is basically his identity his sense of who he is . . . and he gives it up seeminly so quickly for something he was mocking moments before.I mean blame the timeframe...  or so minutes just wasnt enough for Discords full arch. Thats why we got it RETCONed in the premiere. ,MLPAnalysis,cezz5yr,1,t5_2xb3o
295155,0,t3_1xh2a8,Rarity didnt idolize Blueblood or other stallions so she didnt fangirl over them.    She fangirled over big names in the area shes passionate about like Sapphire Shores.Now we see her having a crush on someone she idolizes so yeah its in character to me.I assume the episode where she didnt act on her jealousy was Green Isnt Your Color and thats because there was nothing for her to act on. Shed already lost her chance but that didnt stop her from being jealous of Fluttershy.In this case she could still try to win over Trenderhoof and she was much more passionate about it because of the previous point.,MLPAnalysis,cfbcx5q,2,t5_2xb3o
330700,0,t1_cff1bff,Kind of like how Fluttershy goes nuts when some animals act like normal animals and dont warm up to her? Imagine what shed do in our own world. I think thatd be interesting if that arc got its own episode ending in a lesson about how you canshould love somethingone without demanding that it love you back Although such a lesson could have unfortunate implications if applied to spousesAnd if the Equestrian educational system is Cheerilees Gardens biggest plot hole than dang its miles ahead of just about any other grimdark,MLPAnalysis,cff1qpg,1,t5_2xb3o

405976,0,t3_1yp3ry,gt Whoa. In each episode we see them doing anything they can think of to earn cutie marks. Finally we see them doing something else.Where have you been since One Bad Apple Sleepless in Ponyville Hearts and Hooves Day Family Appreciation Day and Flight to the Finish? We havent had a Cutie Mark centered episode since season  and even in like Ponyville Confidential cutie mark crusading was more of a catalyst for the actual story rather than the story of the episode itself. gt Scootaloo hints at the possibility of a mechanic. Or...maybe not quite that complex. Maybe an Assembler at WalMart.Her specialty will be scooters. Everything about them. How to ride them. How to put them together which isnt hard apparently. I mean you dont see someone put something together from Ikea and go Hey they got a special talent there.. In this particular circumstance I dont see why just because something denotes a different profession in our world that people think its a whole different path in theirs. Pinkie likes parties for example thus she knows everything about making them from baking cakes to balloon animals even though in our world those are different specialties. And I think Appleblooms mark will be making apples bloom. This will incorporate potions as well as fertilizers etc. Itll be pretty fitting. Anyway I agree with most of your review. It annoyed me how the CMC just went along treating Di as someone worth . . . anything. I know forgiveness is big in Equestria but they especially Sweetie Belle took it to a point that it almost seemed shallow or something. It doesnt matter that youre horrible well give you importancethe time of day because you have a swimming pool.And yeah the background characters on this show have always been hive minded and idiotic though never more so than here. Other than that I thought the episode was decentenjoyable.  ,MLPAnalysis,cfmugia,1,t5_2xb3o

2001716,0,t1_ckudsnn,Perhaps Tommy was referring to the manner in which the disagreement was expressed. He was talking about YouTube comments so it is entirely possible that he had witnessed some rather melodramatic discussions on the subject though I suppose this could have been expressed more clearly.

2923141,0,t3_2tk4td,I feel to disagree sure a great villain should never get disarmed but heres the thing. Sunset was disarmed for the most of the time. Sure she worked herself up the ranks of a high school not very threatening by the way but thats it. She done RULE the school she is just a student. She could not do anything without the magic she is trying to obtain. Thats where my sympathy for Sunset kicks in a character thats works hard to get what they want is always sympathic for me no matter good or evil. But the Sirens are a real threat from start to end making them the better villain. Tirek has a power that his similiar to the sirens in regard of being not stoppable in the world around him. He got his power removed at the end of Twilights Kingdom leaving him in the exact same state like the sirens.,MLPAnalysis,co0dc1i,1,t5_2xb3o
