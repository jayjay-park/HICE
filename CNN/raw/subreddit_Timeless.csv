9512811,0,t1_d9lh6dl,The big one is that theyve mentioned multiple times that Rufus is effectively the only one of the good guys that knows how to pilot the machine. Now we arent sure  why because it cant take that much effort to train other people on the machine. I have a theory on what the actual reason why there is only one pilot and it would basically shut down any why cant we have infinite teams solution. And that is that the GovernmentMason Industries want to minimize the number of people that can pilot the time machine so that would prevent another person like Flynn that could steal the ship and cause havok. ,Timeless,d9lnn43,2,t5_2rgzz

9669721,0,t1_da4zll1,gt If Rittenhouse has the wideranging influence in US theres no doubt they would have to be international in some regards. Logically I absolutely agree.  But based on show setup Im less sure.  If we find out Doc didnt make it out then thats more evidence on the International side. Its just so far everything Flynn has done has been about hurting the US.  Or at least hurting Rittenhouse involves hurting US history. Very tied together.  But Rittenhouse should at least have interests abroad as you say.  Thats the way power works.,Timeless,da4zux4,1,t5_2rgzz
9700566,0,t3_5e0gd8,We have no way of knowing how long passes between most episodes. Its could have been December . I doubt its a timeline issue.Flynn is implying that he knows Wyatts personality very wellfrom reading the journal. Or its a straight up bluff.,Timeless,da8svgu,5,t5_2rgzz

9821055,0,t1_daniyi3,You are right that they couldve explained it better but they didnt need to. They tell us from episode  that you cant go back to the same time and maybe say  or  things more about it. Some people took that to mean that you literally couldnt go back to a time where you were alive before. But then this episode proved that theory wrong... so then clearly that wasnt what they meant. So then you look at other ways the statements from the first few episodes could be meant. And thats when you would come to the conclusion that they probably meant that you couldnt bump into yourself in the past.,Timeless,danpaku,1,t5_2rgzz
9980787,0,t3_5iipp9,gtFlynn also isnt shy about sharing that hes a timetraveler with people he plans to kill. Does Rittenhouse Jr hear it? If so that gives Rittenhouse plenty of time to put plans in place to ensure they create and eventually control the time machine.Rittenhouse Jr would be dead by the time he even gets a chance to enact any revenge on Flynn in . ,Timeless,db8iwl8,4,t5_2rgzz

10660136,0,t3_5shzro,Lucy meets with her dad. She doesnt ask what Rittenhouse is. Lucy meets with and befriends Lindbergh. They talk about how overwhelming it is to be in Rittenhouse but she makes no effort to find out what Rittenhouse is.  Did I miss an episode?  Is it just accepted that Rittenhouse is a generic power hungry cabal of rich people and it doesnt need to be discussed more?  I figured there would be a little more to it. ,Timeless,ddfift4,39,t5_2rgzz

10750449,0,t3_5tt9oc,I have a theory concerning the show. I attempted to illustrate to make my point.The first line shows the two potential time traveling scenarios for the second trip after the Hindenburg travel. I am illustrating that after the Hindenburg the  main characters left their original timeline and went to an alternate one where the Hindenburg explosion was changed.The question becomes which timeline did they travel on to visit Lincoln. Did they reconverge to their original timeline or did they travel back in time on the one that the Hindenburg explosion changed? Its a little murky.My nd and rd line show the different travel paths potentially from these visits. Either the second trip reconverged with the hindenburg event changing or the Lincoln they visited was on a separate timeline.Each event causes a new timeline. When the group travels to visit Lincoln this should create a whole new separate timeline from the Hindenburg timeline. The reason being the timeline they created after visiting the Hindenburg saw the events of the Lincoln timeline happen differently such as Grant leaving on a train. What this means on the new Lincoln timeline the group should be able to revisit the Hindenburg and prevent Flynn from making the changes he made without risk of running into themselves as they havent visited on this timeline yet.I hope this all makes sense and Im not just coming across as all nonsense.Desmond Hume is my constant.

10861781,0,t3_5v7jqf,Well... didnt that just suck?But seriously if theres to be a nd or further season did you really think they could root up Rittenhouse that easily?But Lucy amp Wyatt will become a couple however erstwhile. Flynn will become an antihero and likely be sprung by Lucy somehow. Jiya will continue to have visions of a dystopia presentfuture. Rufus will continue to pilot the alternate mothership and be the source of humor. There will be other future plot twists you wont see coming. and Rittenhouse will form the Bank of England then later orchestrate a series of financial crises starting around  that will soften up the American people to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of  that will take the control of the national currency out of the hands of Congress and put it in the hands of a secretive unelected private corporation masquerading as a federal department then in  President Nixon removes the US dollar from the gold standard causing the dollar now the worlds reserve currency to be fiat currency meaning its value is whatever the government controlling it says it is essentially then in  David Rockefeller forms the Trilateral Commission made up of business and political leaders from the United States Europe and Japan ostensively to bring about economic and political cooperation between countries but really position people in powerful positions to foment wars control markets to their favor and in time form a oneworld oligarchy while letting people think they actually control their lives when they really dont.In other words the bank always wins. And until Lucy lets be honest Shes the real central everyman protagonist of this series figures that out and accepts her fate as Rittenhouse royalty theres still a premise for this series.But what do I know? Im just a tinfoil hat conspiracist who just happens to enjoy this show because it has interesting characters and it explores history.Side note Ive heard rumors its been renewed for next season. Is that true?,Timeless,de0bdx5,25,t5_2rgzz
10862306,0,t1_de0d5qm,Hmm good point.  I guess there are all sorts of convoluted ways that she could leave it for him.  Go back to before she was born leave it in a safe deposit box and somehow leave instructions for him to find itinstructions for the bank to send him the contents on a certain day.Or maybe the whole not being able to go back to when you existed is just a made up rule that everyone believes but no one knows for sure if its true.,Timeless,de0dc4e,1,t5_2rgzz
