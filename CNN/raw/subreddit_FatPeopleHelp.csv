4343654,0,t3_3api0a,Throwaway my friends know my other username. Thanks a lot. I love this sub. I am sixteen and I am obese. I weighed like  lbs a few weeks ago. During the fattening or whatever its called I got really motivated especially with this sub in particular. So currently I am about  ten lbs down from last week. I really appreciate what you guys do and this is the first time in my life I tried. I dont have goals I dislike them if I can motivate myself enough I find Ill end up doing the best I can but I have been eating a lot less and working out every day during the week. Today I worked out and started moving away from machines and onto body exercises I dont know what theyre called like push ups crunches etc. I hate aerobic exercises but I hope if I do the anaerobic ones fast enough and have a nice cycle it can substitute enough. I dont have any questions but any more advice is always appreciated. Hopefully I can lose  lbs a week for the rest of the year but thats probably ambitious. ,FatPeopleHelp,csf9ehk,3,t5_37uoc
