765824,0,t1_cgrbkil,Thanks!  Ive done the trip from Birmingham to Nottingham before and didnt find it too terribly difficult.  It seems like you can take the airports internal light rail thingy to a station from which it takes about  m to reach Birmingham New Street.  I think most of the time thats the only transfer but I have to check.  I know Ive had to change at Derby before.That is a bit silly that theres no direct like from EMA to Nottingham.  I had considered actually flying to Glasgow and taking a Flybe flight down there but I may not bother unless I decide to make a day trip of Glasgow.  ,nottingham,cgrbvho,1,t5_2qmbu
