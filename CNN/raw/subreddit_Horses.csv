Theres no way theyre selling them at a price that a kill buyer would be interested in.  They have too much money invested into each foal and too high of a quality of product to waste like that.  I know that when people hear about a big multinational corporation breeding animals they assume the worst but if such a company is working hard to produce quality animals and taking good care of them they dont deserve these rumors.

1857009,0,t3_2fusz7,Boots are a great way to get the benefits of barefoot while still protecting him from hard rocks.  Renegades are very popular although I have no personal experience with them.  Ive always used Easyboots.  After a trim measure the feet using the guidelines  Easyboot Gloves are great for trails although the feet must fit perfectly.  My horse for example has narrow feet size  in length and size  in width so she needs boots with a little stronger fit.  For her I use the Epics.  Theyre a little tougher to get on and off but they wont come off.  Ive even ran barrels in them.    The new Easyboot Trail is awesome too.  Its on a Glove base but has velcro that wraps around to increase the fit.   Ive found that they dont last as long though so some of it depends on how many miles youre riding.  For more miles they recommend the Back Country.,Horses,ckcyqmo,2,t5_2qlye

2536574,0,t1_cmpgpr0,Well getting rid of the debris  which is indeed irritating  IS important. Otherwise you get infections and so on going on there. Not so much in stallions which will have naturally cleaning erections but more so in geldings. Also please control if a bean is building up in both. I have pulled the most horrific sized beans out of some horses. So that cleaning is totally necessary.Does that make horses faster on the track? ... Id doubt it unless the guy is extremely sensitive down there. Like extremely extremely sensitive. If he is used to it and didnt get his usual treatment now it feels like you feel if your underwear just sits a bit wrong  I can see how that would irritate him and then reflect on his performance.As for the completion It is usually very very difficult to get a stallion to flare and ejaculate  without some animation by a nearby mare it is almost impossible by default. If he is however so sensitive then I can see how he likes the warm water and sponging it off. As someone said stallions get to fruition in  seconds or so if they are into it. Thats easily reached in cleaning it. Perhaps your friend is also simply mistaking some precum for the actual ejaculation the difference can be told foremost by whether the horse is flared. And hey men get precum thinking about something really hot for a bit in a stallion its just a bit more according to body size.  Or he is used for breeding and gets off on the good memories cleaning him induces as someone said.Could jacking off your stallion in itself be a winning strategy? Yeah why not  it might by now be part of the racing ritual for him. It might pump his system full of testosterone while also releasing stress and frustration that would lead to unruly and thus counterproductive behavior under the saddle. But this last paragraph is totally speculating a veterinarian could do a much better evaluation of that idea.Also just leave her alone with it even if you think its just excuses. Its her horse after all. Even if she is just doing for idk  this is hardly hurting him. And every other rider is pulling the beans out of their horses penii when nobody looks etc like I am too I hope everyone else is concerned with not getting an infection in their horses down there.

Now that Im supporting myself I mostly work on bonding with my pony. I currently have hh POA who was borderline feral when I got him a year and a half ago. Ive been taking dressage and jumping lessons on him and did a small event with him in the fall. Hes such a sweet boy and he tries so hard to do what I want.

3090948,0,t3_2vk14l,Ive gone through many periods of burnout and have picked up and put down full time horse life multiple times.  With five years straight under your belt I bow down.  Youve made it much longer than most in my opinion and a considerably longer stretch than Ive been able to pull off.What are your ultimate goals? Having seen the industry on this level do you still have a fire in your belly to be a professional horse person? Does the voice inside your head tell you to go toward an office job with climate control and health insurance while you still can? Do you imagine eventually having a boarding facility? Do you want to be a trainer or a breeder? Do you want a family one day and maybe enough land to have a horse or two in your backyard?You can leave full time horse life and still have a horse and ride either recreationally or seriously. Ive done both. If you can leave your current situation on excellent terms you should be able to return as long as you remain physically capable of doing the work. I have to imagine youve proven your worth a thousand times over by now.  Dont lose touch with your pro friends. Youre not an idiot and theres no reason not to take a break.

Get them into a foster home have a meeting with the vet to get essential sales things hammered out age height weight any medical problems breed temperament whether theyre up to date on hoofcare and shots etc and ask any trainersetc that your mother may have worked with what they know about each horses training level. These people can also help establish what the horses ideal asking price should be and whether each is best for a beginner intermediate or advanced rider.Once youve got these things sorted out itll be a lot easier to establish a sale. If the horses each have their own specific tack set even just a bridle mention in the ad that it will be included with the horse unless these are super expensive custom pieces. If that happens to be the case send the bit for each horse with them. Saddles and the like can be sold for decent prices unless you just want to be rid of them without the hassle. Keep your price above  unless the horse is really old or needs a lot of training in that case require a visit to the facilities the horse will be in and a meeting with the owner.

You saying you have been working with him for months and making little progress to me is a lot like someone saying theyve been working out at the gym with no results for months to a personal trainer.  It just makes me think that your horse has holes in his foundation and they are coming out when he is in a new situation.Down in your comments you say Hell go pretty much anywhere.  So youve used pretty specific language here.  Why pretty much anywhere?  Why not absolutely anywhere?  That makes me feel there is a hole there.  That horse should go anywhere.  It shouldnt matter if there is a creek in the way a tarp on the fence a motorcycle making noise.....a person on his back.  It just seems to me with the limited knowledge I can deduce here that he is pretty good willy nilly unless things are not going as expected then he phones it in.Driving is easier for a horse who lacks confidence.  They can SEE you.  Like leading peripheral vision while driving.  It is much easy to get a horse confident with you both on the ground.  That is why we start there and not with riding.  He may be a quiet worryer.  Build his confidence.  Say with conviction that he DOES go anywhere no matter what make it happen and then see what he is like when taking on new tasks.,Horses,cq1nzbt,4,t5_2qlye

I trail ride exclusively and I can tell you what I have seen some BIG women riding horses. Small horses. And then think about cowboys big burly men riding little horses hh quarter horses for hours at a time. Theres tons of studies that claim that horses can only hold x weight and this and that but a recent study actually stated that the weight limit was much lower effectively putting most of us well over it with tack included. But I doubt many women gave up riding because one study claimed that... I take all that with a grain of salt. Ride a horse make sure you have it worked on regularly by a chiropractor vet and probably a few other professionals to check for back soreness.  Id look into boarding barns that have draft horses or larger warmbloods that can carry a larger person.

4470249,0,t3_3cat27,I agree with the other poster about a retirement plan. Simply said you waited too long with a  year old horse to come to a decision. Most people have no desire to take on a horse of that age even for free. That age at auction Indiana or no will likely end up being shipped to Mexico for slaughter. Ouch. Id rather put a horse down than send them through that trauma. Im positive thats not what any of us want for our animals so I have a few suggestions in addition to what other posters have said about lesson horses look for a retirement pasture thats affordable with turnout and supervisory care. Thats your financial responsibility to him in my opinion and its generally much cheaper than general boarding. Theres facilities in every state so thats just time and legwork on your part to find him a spot at one you can afford. find a therapy ranch who would consider taking him on. If hes well behaved despite the fact hes likely quite rusty and out of condition there may well be a place there for him. They often look for solid well broke babysitters to work with but you might want to consider putting him in a  day training program before you offer him to anyone. Having volunteered at several they generally had one shot to be considered for retirement there. If they were high strung or misbehaved when we put a series of kids through basic tests with them they went right back. You want to give him the best chance at placement possible and if he hasnt had much work and is not conditioned at  he will take a few months to leg up.  days however would at least get the bugs out and have him more responsive. I understand the difficultly of being overseas and trying to manage decisions here but personally I think we owe our horses a retirement plan. Owning one is a lifelong decision. Theyre often not easy to sell or even give away and one injury can change their lives forever.

He only made it a few feet and I stopped him well clearly I wasnt prepared for how quickly he was gonna stop and I kept going. I had a hold of the reins still but then the bugger decided he was going to rear so I decided holding the reins wasnt worth him possibly landing on me so I let go and rolled out of the way.

6449247,0,t3_440ada,In my opinion looking at that picture your horse is a long way from further training especially under saddle. If hes still lame at the walk then hes not really rideable again in my opinion. Now of course I cant see him in person so I would ask your vet if hes ok to start under saddle. If he is then I would get a trainer a good one because this is a special needs horse that will need different tactics than a normal horse. Layne cant be bucking around or bolting during his training because of his injury.I dont mean to put a damper on everything. I really hope that Layne heals up great and you get to ride him around for the next  decades. But for his safety you need to take things really slowly with him. If you start him too soon and he tears what little tendon he has left... the results wont be good.,Horses,czme51i,13,t5_2qlye

6835587,0,t3_49dful,bareback pads with stirrups are dangerous and theyre mimicking a saddle but without what makes a saddle safe  the tree. Imagining putting all that extra weight and pressure onto your horses back through your body and the leverage the stirrups give but with no tree to take the brunt of it. Not to mention that stirrups without a tree will do the opposite for your balance and can seriously cause you to get injured because theres again no tree to balance the leverage. With no tree as soon as you put any weight into the stirrups the pad is going to slip and youre likely to get hurt.Please dont use a bareback pad with stirrups.

In many cases I have found that it is possible to get the horse comfortable again but in some cases the horse never developed enough muscle to work and stay sound.

8023688,0,t1_d4h6gbp,The big Silly bullheaded gelding goes great in a bit now as well did a bit of retaining with him... I think he was just bored tbh and learned some bad habits my point was more that even heavy horses can be ridden effectively without a bit. What I meant by not relying on the bit is basically just that if I can teach a horse to go basically strictly with leg and seat the horse rides a lot better than when you get on a horse that follows its head does that make sense? I am super eloquent obviously. Good point about the crayon thing lol. I suppose especially in dressage where acceptance of the bit is part of the scoring you would get a lot more control over the finer aspects of the horses movement. Good point! And yeah... Those lazycoldwet days... They are happening more and more frequently for me with the few horses Im riding Im living in South Australia at the moment for school and its winter. The other day I didnt even put reins on the halter and just rode in the round yard arena was too muddy  stupid rainy winter. The struggle is real.

I took one inside the riding arena and the other in the barn aisle both around dusk so there was ambient light however you dial down the camera to basically take a black photo then you use flash to light your subject.  The effect is that the entire background is blacked out and only the subject has light on them and is properly exposed.  You can technically do it in daylight but to truly get a dark exposure youd probably want to be in the shade.  Direct sun would be difficult to blot out.Very little editing was done to these photos its basically all incamera and in the flash setup.

9482888,0,t3_5ahyhf,Im not sure if you realise how big of a task this is....  Do you have enough money to buy a team of good strong horses and a support crew who will follow you around the country not working for  months in order to supply you with feed and water whilst you ride?   Most people use about  horses.  as a pack  as a riding horse and the rest to be rotated. Its pretty tretcherous territory so you can expect one to be unridable at any time usually due to hoof issues. Its an extremely expensive undertaking. Feed itself is very expensive. Im in a fairly remote area in Australia and our hay is  for a small grassy bale that last  days for my paddock bum. Say you have  horses thats  every  days. Thats  per week or  in hay over  months. That doesnt include hard feed and grain which is incredibly expensive in Australia particularly when it has to be exported to remote places. Transport fees can be a killer too. This will be more expensive than your hay and with how hard the horses will be worked they will need it.   Then of course you need access to a support crew or at least one person who will follow you around via vehicle scouting for feed there not any shops in the outback this is difficult and driving ahead to drop it at your future camp sites. Also they will be finding food for you organising water permits etc. Because theres no internet out there no phone reception for a lot of way. You need to be able to finance all these expenses the support crews vehicle rego and fuel another expensive thing in Aus and your support crews accommodation and food expensive. Unless you have a person willing to take that long off work without an income then you will need to pay them a wage for their efforts as well. Can you afford to pay them  months of income whilst you are not working yourself and  months of hotel accommodation for them? And all their meals everyday?    Of course you also need to be able to afford  good strong horses or Ive seen people use  horses and a donkey or mule transportation the start and from the end I got my horse trucked top to bottom of Australia that was  per horse  thats  for the crew. And you need to be able to have saved enough to support yourself your food your accommodation etc for  months without any income.  IIf you honestly have that kinda of money then maybe its possible.

9521813,0,t3_5b50eg,A friend of mine actually made this her business and she cannot even meet the demand. She works for auctions brokers and breeders to produce sale videos and take sale photographs. But shes not in the US. Shes in Europe and drives around a lot. Sale videos are however typically less artsy here. In fact theres actually a pretty standard format that for instance auctions use. Good quality of standard shots is more important than blurred and artsy quality of inspirational shots. Speaking from my own experience when looking for a horse a video is a musthave in a horse ad but I did not have the patience to watch it in full. It is information not entertainment. I skipped a lot through videos. I dont need  min of walk I can see the basic quality after some seconds.Show me their quality of movement in walk trot canter if ridden under the rider if not yet then on the lunge line or running around. For jumpers show me them freejumping andor a few fences under the rider. Optional If you are selling a trained dressage horse show some select lectures to demonstrate its level of training. I dont need more. If the horse looks good based on that and everything else sounds right I wanna see it in person anyway. The drawback for you however is that these videos are not as fulfilling if you typically enjoy editing a lot and making your videos a special thing. ,Horses,d9mrkfg,2,t5_2qlye

9996851,0,t3_5ipxft,I grew up in Michigan where it spends much of the winter at or below freezing. My trainers always said that you risk pneumonia in your horse if you work them when its too cold the moisture in the air condenses in their breathing passages and collects in their lungs if youre working them theyre breathing harder and their body temperature is going up. Whether thats true or not I dont know but if it was uncomfortable for me to breathe outside I didnt have lessons. When I had my own horse Id jump on over his blanket and do a bit of walktrot just to keep his joints loose but nothing that got him breathing hard.,Horses,dbam9pr,3,t5_2qlye

If you use a leveraged hackamore you need to move you hand less to signal the horse as opposed to using a regular hackamore... this is the same with bits. you could use the leverage to increase your strength when bullying the animal but this is the wrong way to use the tool IMO,Horses,dccdw6x,1,t5_2qlye

10322510,0,t1_dcdzciu,In the boarding contract it states that if a full care horse becomes a danger to the stable hands the horse will become self care by the owner. Before the fence jumping incident she was taken off full care and the owner was given her official written warning. She was also removed from the more public pastures and has since been only turned out with my two so that I do not have to worry about other boarders safety.  My horses are kept separately still because of Aras issues. There are plenty of signs as well as all my boarders have all been both verbally told and have written notices that those pastures are not for public use.Back when the horse first started having issues she kicked at one of my stable hands I offered her the basic exercisetraining option we have for full care boarders. It mostly involves the horses being lunged for  mns and then either handwalked or rode for  mns for  days a week.She turned it down because the horse competes in barrel racing and she didnt want the horse to be confused by our training. As of now shes been given her second written warning and told that she has a month from the written notice to show improvement in her horses behavior or her contract will be terminated. If she does not feel like she has the ability or time to work with her horse then she can either hire an outside trainer or she hire one of mine or myself.,Horses,dce439a,2,t5_2qlye

This women is named Ivy and shes very popular in the gaited world as she trains horses to gait naturally specifically those gaited horses who have lost their gait and started to pace or trot. Look through her videos and youll see a ton of natural gaited horses lots of Walkers and lots of before and afters of her training.  This video is by Brenda Imus who was a great natural trainer of gaited horses. She was wonderful. If you just google or youtube TWH for sale youll probably get a ton of natural videos. Theres way more TWHs used as trail horses than padded ones. I also have videos of my own mare if you wanted to see those as well. ,Horses,dcgh8j6,3,t5_2qlye
10420294,0,t1_dcp6nhd,Agreed she must have beenis in so much pain. I can only imagine how horrible it would have gotten if not treated early. I cant help but wonder how long she has been in pain. I think the hardest part of animal ownership is they cant tell us when and where they hurt  I try to be really vigalent with pain issues. Last year my other mare had a sore back and stopped wanting to move forward under saddle slight inconsistent limp sometimes on different legs. Normally she is a very forward mare so I knew something was up. I talked to the trainers at the barn and they said shes just being lazy and trying to get out of work! I got the chiro out and she was out badly in the SI joint several places in her back withers ribs and poll and showed symptoms of ulcers. She was much better after a couple of visits from the chiro and ulcer treatment. We also left that barn. Riding and owning horses is the best thing in my life but none of it is worth it is my animals are in pain. ,Horses,dcp7jcg,3,t5_2qlye

10912448,0,t3_5vwoc7,Working with horses entails long hard hours for very little pay. Very few people make it big in the equine world. Most muck stalls and give lessons for little money. I attended Michigan State University for their horse management program. I did the cert not the degree and it was  a semester for  semesters two year course. After finishing my total bill would be near  in student loan debt only to go out and find a job paying under the table for less than minimal wage. If I was lucky I could work in a barn in exchange for free board or lessons. I didnt finish the program and decide to quit after  semester. Honest its not worth it. If you love animals become a vet. Or start your own petoriented business not boarding. Go to school for something you can make money with and then do horses outside of work.In todays market with the increasing cost of living the lack of increasing wages people not finding jobs etc... it doesnt make fiscal sense to knowingly go into an industry where money isnt at. ,Horses,de5ji9o,7,t5_2qlye

11139784,0,t3_5z0ntm,I second the fecal count idea although the problem is some parasites wont be seen in the stool at an appreciable level until the infestation is severe. So I would add to fecal count that any horse who passes a fecal but still appears wormy prominent ribs but fat belly dull coat etc should be wormed. Its also my opinion that horses in high risk situations should be regularly wormed situations like horses turned out with many other horses at facilities where worming isnt monitored andor sanitation is poor example pasturespaddocks rarely dragged horses that travel frequently horses that come into contact with other livestockwildlife or areas other livestockwildlife have been new horses whos prior management is unknown etc. The issue is reinfection rates are extremely high with some parasites even the horses own feces can cause reinfection and some parasites can lay dormant for months and still viably infect hosts so in multiple owner situations worming serves to both lower parasite load in the individual horse as well as provide some measure of protection for the larger equine population. Its very important to note that all animals yes even humans carry a variety of parasites and can carry a certain load with no ill effects. Its not realistic or natural to expect a horse to ever be completely free of parasites instead the goal of worming is to prevent the infestation from reaching levels which negatively impact the host. For those concerned about the cost of frequent fecal testing or who have a lot of horses its really not very expensive but the cost certainly adds up your own fecal tests can be done at home with a microscope and some research. The benefit assuming the person feels confident with the microscope and identifying common equine parasites is that it allows you to perform fecal tests more frequently and therefore be more thorough. Ideally any horse with an acceptable fecal count should be rechecked from different bowel movements two more times over the next week as shedding can vary quite a bit between movements and its possible for an infested horse to produce a relatively clean sample. All horses should be dewormed regardless of fecal count at least once or twice a year as some parasites live encysted in the organs and tissues of the host and can be extremely dangerous and yet unlikely to show on a fecal test.
