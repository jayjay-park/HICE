My uncle used to own a night club there and said the night life was great and that there is something to do every night. It is probably the most modernwesternized city in Bolivia. ,BOLIVIA,cot5z62,1,t5_2qwbf

Chifa is popular but only tangentially related to Chinese food other than that Asian restaurants are not especially common and Corea Town is the only one Id recommend.gt dont drink viscachani waterIts...an acquired taste.,BOLIVIA,d7q7qen,2,t5_2qwbf

Western Union es una empresa de remesas o sea es solo para enviar dinero FedEx y DHL son los mejores para enviar y recibir pero en precios no te sacan un ojo de la cara si no conoces el procedimiento de envio. ,BOLIVIA,ddz5xwi,1,t5_2qwbf
