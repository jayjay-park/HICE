You are right in a sense that on average it wouldnt matter but because I dont know the elevation that OP lives at nor the quality of his glass it would be much safer to get a new one. E.G.

2188725,0,t1_clh8tpg,Best one Ive ever made was out of an empty .L bottle of Jim beam. Take some twine soak it in acetone rubbing alcohol or anything likewise flammable. Then wrap the twine around the bottom of the bottle a couple times and tie it off tightly. Light it on fire and wait about  secs or so then dunk it straight into a bucket of ice water. Youll hear a loud crack and the bottom should pop right off. Oh and keep the top on the bottle while youre doing this. Im no physicist but I think the pressure in the bottle has a little bit to do with it though Im sure its mostly due to the glass cooling off so quickly. If you have the the twine together and tied tight it should leave a pretty smooth edge on the bottom but you can sand it down with a file if you feel so inclined. Doesnt really matter anyway since its gonna be sitting on the bottom of your water bucket. As far as a glass bowl any bowl from a bong will work. Just drill or you can even just bore it out with a knife a hole in the plastic cap to your liquor bottle barely wide enough to work the bowl down in there. Or if you dont have a spare bowl lying around a socket from a socket wrench will work just fine. ,StonerEngineering,cli1gmc,2,t5_2slm7

2948198,0,t3_2tt5kv,Ive done a lot of research and have made multiple prototypes so I would like to share my conclusions to hopefully save you guys some time! Just a sidenote there are easier and cheaper ways to build a DIY MFLB however I put a lot of emphasis on safety in this design which slightly complicates things.Wood For the wooden body I used two pieces of untreated wood. I found that the easiest way was to create two halvesa bottom and a top that joined where the stainless steel mesh is. I used a cnc milling machine to accurately carve out grooves for the wires trench etc. If you dont have access to a milling machine I believe it would be possible to do the same with a dremel and a steady hand. You can use a screw to join the two halves.Wiring Solid copper is ideal in my opinion. My wiring is essentially the same as the MFLB. Regarding safety this wiring is not harmful. While it is dangerous to make a copper pipe the copper wiring in this design is not subject to an open flame nor does it reach temps above  degrees F. These factors deem the copper wiring to be safe. Mesh I think using stainless steal is a given.    works fine. Just make sure the mesh is not coated with anything. I got mine off Amazon.Solder This is where I believe most builders have it wrong. The solder is necessary to adequately join the mesh to the wires. Simply using silver solder is not enough to ensure inhalation safety. Firstly silver solders while silver based often include lead andor candium. Both are harmful if inhaled. Secondly silver solder is a soft solder meaning it has a melting point at around  degree F. When solder such as this melts it releases fumes which arent exactly healthy. What I used and highly recommend is to use food grade silver brazing solder. Brazing solder is a hard solder. It has a melting point often above  degrees F. Since it is food grade it does not contain harmful elements. However because it has such a high melting point a torch is required to apply it. This solder is more expensive. Its also relatively hard to find so heres the link Other The acrylic and battery are straightforward.I hope this was helpful!

The bowl is deeep not very wide though which can make it hard to break apart a packed bowl I just use sticks. It pulls so goddamn smooth for the first few. Once it gets hot though you can stick it in the snow which is now all gone and since its metal it retains the cold very well or put it in the fridge before hand. For a sense of scale that middle piece that makes up the stem is  x  inches. Small enough to fit in a pocket and if it doesnt fit just take it apart.

11216561,0,t1_df1f8de,I just drilled a couple holes in the bottom with a glass drill bit. But for removing the entire bottom lots of people recommend tying a string around the bottom soaking it in rubbing alcohol lighting it and then dunking it in ice water after the flame goes out. The expanding and then rapidly contracting glass pops the bottom off... sometimes. Sometimes you get jagged edges and cracks up the length of the bottle. You can use a glass drill bit to carve a ring in the bottom to help it break off in once piece when you do the fire and ice technique. Make sure to sand your edges afterwards regardless of what you do. ,StonerEngineering,df3dtl6,3,t5_2slm7
