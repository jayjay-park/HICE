I dont know if you like to partake in smoking but Farrah has said that she does so possibly weed  drunk bunny Deb  Simon the emotional punching bag to take out all your frustration on just might get you through.I do love Farrahs house and as overdone as her plastic surgery is she looks amazing in the clothes she wears so theres that.As far as paying for the wedding I assumed MTV footed all those types of bills but its a big assumption on my part. Have never heard confirmation on it. ,teenmoms,d7d1vji,3,t5_3g4wc

9133604,0,t3_55e0pi, pics of Kail at home. She had her makeup professionally done didnt screen grab it and is taking photos with her and the boys. The pics of the boys were on the trampoline.  I wonder what the pics are for? The fact shes not there makes me think Chelseas wedding is small and intimate! Ps I love Kails new haircut! Makes me wanna go short! But it took me too long to grow my hair out hahaha I think she looks really good and I hope she doesnt start messing with her face more than her lip injections.  I think she is on the bigger side but carries it well most of the time,teenmoms,d89r0mz,8,t5_3g4wc
