11256520,0,t1_df7qfuf,This.  I believe the fifth droid is k Crystals.  So buying th and th will still leave you with some to later boost stuff if desired.But if you can have  things building at once or three and two to repair your dekkas you wont be sad.  Think long term not short boosting upgrade finish times.,SWCommander,df7wr3p,1,t5_3384c
