11749457,0,t3_67o14t,The Cost of Trumps Retreat From RightsMEXICO CITY  Last month the United States declined to appear before the InterAmerican Human Rights Commission in Washington for the first time in decades.It is a member and participates regularly in the commissions meetings. But this time it was the United States delegation that faced questioning  about President Trumps executive orders to bar travelers from six Muslimmajority countries to accelerate deportation of undocumented migrants and to weaken environmental regulations.The refusal to appear placed Washington in the dubious company of Nicaragua Venezuela and Cuba on accountability for human rights compliance.Congratulations Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.Granted the United States has never been totally consistent in championing human rights abroad nor perfect in achieving those ideals at home. It also is not a party to the  American Convention on Human Rights. But in openly retreating from its selfappointed role as a defender of the ideals that underpin the compact it is showing cynical contempt for human rights even as a goal. This practically guarantees a result we are beginning to see Dictators and other bullies are emboldened to trample rights and liberties with impunity.Already in the Western Hemisphere and the Middle East there is grim confirmation that steadfast support from Washington is essential if the rest of the world is to take human rights seriously.Mr. Trump has grown cozy with Abdel Fattah elSisi of Egypt an egregious rights violator whom he recently celebrated at the White House as a fantastic guy. He stopped openly expressing admiration for Vladimir V. Putin of Russia only after he backed up the Syrian dictator Bashar alAssads patently false denial that sarin gas was used to kill Syrian civilians  an atrocity that even Mr. Trump had to acknowledge was the work of an animal.And in recent weeks Secretary Tillerson chose not to promulgate his departments annual Human Rights Report while proposals to chop American assistance for international organizations contributed to fears within the United Nations that the United States might withdraw from the Human Rights Council.Recently President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico put the issue of impunity front and center when he sent a bill to Mexicos Congress that would weaken many judicial reforms adopted in the last decade. The fairtrial standards that could be gutted include the presumption of innocence the inadmissibility of hearsay and testimony obtained under torture and a prohibition on holding suspects for a long time without trial.The reforms being overturned had been undertaken after Washington pressed for them. In  Mr. Pea Nietos predecessor Felipe Caldern sought American aid for his reckless bloody and exorbitant war on drugs. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama foolishly acquiesced in exchange demanding changes in Mexicos justice system and providing funds for the changes.Mr. Pea Nietos backtracking also includes seeking passage  long delayed by Congress  of an internal security law. In principle it creates a legal framework for the militarys role in law enforcement emphasizing drug trafficking and organized crime. But it also would allow a near state of siege in locales where the police have proved incapable of guaranteeing order. Many Mexican legal analysts say this could offer the military a blanket amnesty for human rights violations.Under other circumstances the United States could be a force for the rule of law human rights and civilian control over the military in Mexico  for example by rescinding a shameful decision last year by President Obamas State Department to certify that Mexico had made enough progress in human rights to receive new funding.But what case could the Trump administration make to deter Mr. Pea Nieto from suppressing the judicial reforms? Many Mexicans would protest Who are they in Washington to lecture us about due process or the presumption of innocence? Those people drafted the Homeland Security Departments new guidelines on expanded expedited removal and chargeable acts with the explicit purpose of speeding up and increasing deportations of Mexicans.This is the key issue. By recommending that expedited removal be extended to migrants detained anywhere in the United States rather than just within  miles of the border and to all who have been in the United States for up to two years rather than two weeks John F. Kelly the Homeland Security secretary proposes to eliminate due process for many undocumented migrants. Now the matter is in the courts and it could take years for a definitive decision by the Supreme Court which ruled in  that individuals without papers were entitled to due process.In the meantime how can Washington press Mexico to maintain its reforms on due process when the administration is fighting for the right to deport tens or hundreds of thousands of Mexicans without their day in court?The same logic applies to the presumption of innocence. Washingtons new guidelines put at risk of immediate deportation any person whom a customs or border agent believes may have committed a chargeable act. The deportee need not have been charged tried and sentenced and the nature of the act would be irrelevant. Just being in the United States without authorization could provoke arrest and in the absence of priorities for deportation it is the easiest offense to invoke.Mexico is not the hemispheres only skeptic about Mr. Trumps policies. Fearing that democracy itself is in jeopardy in Latin America the Organization of American States is about to embark on a complex route to suspending Venezuela from its ranks. By invoking the InterAmerican Democratic Charter a group of those nations hopes to force the government of the quasi dictator Nicols Maduro to call elections and free political prisoners or face suspension.The group of countries includes the United States and Mexico leaving Mr. Maduro a virtual invitation to fire back Who are Trump and Pea Nieto to give Venezuela lessons on democracy and human rights when one would return to letting a court accept confessions obtained under torture and the other threatens to deport hundreds of thousands of people without a hearing?Indeed Washington has anything but a sterling record on human rights issues in Latin America where it has supported or tolerated countless dictatorships. But at the end of the Reagan administration and the Cold War a distinct new appreciation of the benefits of democratic governance and human rights became a canon at least verbally in every presidents policies. Certainly Mr. Obama had more achievement to flaunt in encouraging reconciliation in Cuba and Colombia and much less to regret elsewhere than his predecessors.And that is all the more reason that regression is so perilous.Even when the United States puts its full efforts behind human rights and democracy the results can be disappointing. Countries like Mexico will ultimately be obliged to fix their justice and law enforcement systems on their own.Still it is better to have the United States with all its power on the right side of the equation rather than on the wrong side where President Trump is increasingly placing it.NY Times articles have  tracking cookies and  tracking scripts.

11764831,0,t3_67vsl0,California Today Pondering Life in California  Years AgoGood morning.Want to get California Today by email? Heres the signup.California cradle of the first freeways skateboards canned tuna fish ... Americans?A study published by the journal Nature on Wednesday made a startling claim Turns out prehistoric humans may have arrived in what is now California  years ago.The finding based on examination of mastodon bones found near San Diego would upend our understanding of the arrival of people in the Americas. Currently the earliest widely accepted evidence of settlement is less than  years old.Carl Zimmer a science writer explained the new study in The Times. We caught up with him via email.Q. How big is this?A. If it turned out to be true it would be a very big deal pushing back human occupation in the Americas over  years. But thats a very very big if based on my interviews with other experts.Q. You reported that theres quite a bit of skepticism. What should we make of that?A. This is part of the scientific process. Scientists develop a hypothesis to explain evidence and test it and then its up to other researchers to challenge its premises and find ways to test it for themselves. This particular case reveals how the standards of proof can go up when the stakes go up. If people want to make a big claim other scientists are going to expect a lot of evidence to back it up. Experts I spoke to thought that evidence fell short in this case.Q. What would life in California have been like  years ago?A. It would be pretty nice. The weather would be comfortable and there would be lots of grass and trees. The area was home to many big animals including camels giant ground sloths and dire wolves sort of like the ones in Game of Thrones.Q. Suppose its right could modern Californians be related?A.

Berkeley has handled the commotion over Ann Coulters plan to speak at the campus.Since the university last week canceled the event citing safety concerns there have been heated debates over free speech rights a lawsuit and vows from the conservative writer to show up anyway.On Wednesday Ms. Coulter reversed herself saying she would not appear on Thursday after all because conservative groups pulled their support.Writing in The Times Nicholas Dirks the chancellor said Berkeley was under attack from both the far right and the far left.With few exceptions those who wrote to us felt Ms. Coulter should have a right to speak. But they were divided over whether it was the correct call to cancel the event.A sample of the responsesInstead of canceling her appearance they should have let her go on as scheduled with double or triple the number of campus police. By canceling her they empowered those hate groups. Now those kinds of threats will never end. Richard Jones TruckeeIf the Berkeley College Republicans are willing to provide and pay for security to keep Ann Coulter safe from violent leftist thugs then by all means let it happen. Stan Roe ClaytonIt is not her free speech which is being threatened here it is her safety and the safety of people who come to hear or protest. Claire Callahan Goodman OaklandCoulter does indeed have the right to free speech. Berkeley however has no legal duty to provide her with a forum.

11768750,0,t3_67xpsy,A.M.T. With Few Defenders Is Newly Targeted in Trump Tax PlanThis is an updated version of an article published on March .Hardly anyone likes the alternative minimum tax a provision that both President Trumps skeletal tax plan and the House Republican overhaul would eliminate.At its most basic the A.M.T.s goal is simple In a tax system with enough loopholes to fill a macram tapestry the idea was to ensure that the richest taxpayers were not able to skip out on paying altogether. A version was introduced in  after Congress discovered that  are you ready?   taxpayers with taxable incomes over  paid no tax.But critics across the political spectrum have long complained that it has failed to live up to the promise. Both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans proposed overhaul of the code would eliminate the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. During his Democratic presidential campaign Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont suggested replacing the A.M.T. with a flat  percent rate on deductions for highincome households. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate within the Internal Revenue Service once called it the most serious problem facing taxpayers.The minimum tax has gone through several iterations but the essential intent has not changed to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years though inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness  as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income which insulates the richest Americans.About  percent of households earning  to  in  are being hit by the minimum tax as are  percent of those earning  to  million according to calculations from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But only a fifth of the total earn more than  million and face the minimum tax.Of the . million filers paying the A.M.T. in  most either have large families and therefore are entitled to several personal exemptions or live in hightax states and can deduct the state and local taxes they pay said William G. Gale codirector at the Tax Policy Center. Thats not the kind of egregious tax sheltering that we think were going after said Mr. Gale a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George Bush. Despite its existence some very highincome people are paying no taxes.Kyle Pomerleau of the conservative Tax Foundation agrees that its not typical that the very very wealthy pay any A.M.T.Yet while policy makers on both sides of the aisle want to get rid of the alternative tax their proposed solutions would have opposite effects. President Trump and congressional Republicans want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax in the context of lowering tax rates  especially for those at the top of the income ladder. The richest would benefit the most. By contrast Senator Sanderss plan to ditch the A.M.T. is part of an effort to raise rates on the wealthiest Americans.Mr. Trump has personal experience with the provision It ended up costing him an additional  million in federal income taxes in  that a banquet of deductions would have otherwise enabled him to avoid paying.What is interesting about the impact on Mr. Trumps  return however is that it does not illustrate either sides criticisms. Rather it seems to be a rare case where the alternative minimum tax functioned exactly as it was meant to to require a wealthy multimillionaire to pay more of a fair share. In Mr. Trumps case he paid  percent of  million in taxable income instead of the less than  percent that he would have paid without it.Trump seems to have been hit by the A.M.T. Mr. Gale said. At least in that one case it seems to have worked as intended.NY Times articles have  tracking cookies and  tracking scripts. This comment has none.,AutoNewspaper,dgu0ojy,1,t5_3h9d4
