Or Cascade Pass and  Sahale Arm but try to find a recent trip report to check snow conditions first wta.org or summitpost.org are good resourcesThere is or was a group called Thursday Night Afterburners that basically gets off work on Thursdays and then speedhikes up and down a nearby mountain usually with a fair amount of elevation gain.

Also in your example since ARs are rarely used negligently the premium would be less than for other guns like hunting shotguns.

Now what do you call the Seattle sub?  For a sub whose name is specific and unambiguous it really ought to have some ability to govern how its managed.Your argument is like saying The CocaCola Company shouldnt care about their CocaCola trademark.  The name they sell it under is far less important than the drink itself.  That may be true in theory but in practice CocaCola would see take a huge hit in sales if they started calling their drink something else.The brand matters and the Seattle brand doesnt belong to a moderator on Reddit.

It will not be too long before this starts to burn them out.    The rseattle and rseattleWA subreddit communities have been very generous to me with research papers outlining the science behind this decision and the fact is that ALL students benefit from more sleep and ALL students are adversely affected by less sleep. For the more scholarly among you here is what people have sent me over the last week specific to elementary school aged children Short sleep duration in middle childhood Risk factors and consequencesThe effects of sleep restriction and extension on schoolage children what a difference an hour makes Sleep restriction  hour in children  led to reduced reported alertnessAnd this is my favorite one. Sleep habits and disorders in Finnish schoolchildren The Finnish research paper is incredible.  of preadolescent kids naturally wake up after AM This initiative from the Seattle Public School Board has always been spun courtesy no doubt from the previous Board President  infomercial director as a late start but really its just an earlier start for elementary school children. And theres the rub. This has little to do with helping our children it has to do with saving money on buses when the board decides to announce their reroutes later this year. The cost?

9157475,0,t1_d8cpy5b,I dont agree with your portrayal of the oil market as it blends supply consumption and inventory shocks and attributes price effects to supply. For example when Venezuela experienced an oil strike at the end of  that reduced production by  annualized other oil producers immediately responded by increasing production and releasing inventory. Even if that model were true its a strained analogy because you are comparing a relatively homogenous product light sweet crude to housing. A high marginal buyer in isolation only plots new points to the right of the historical demand curve. If you are arguing that the whole demand curve is shifting DUE to the new data points then you have to have more than just the existence of the new data points. I still suspect that you are making an attribution error because housing price jumps tend to happen when the demand curve is shifting due to secular changes like concentrated wealth and the value of network effects supply is constrained and impaired mortgage systems dont smooth the price jumps. ,SeattleWA,d8crz6i,5,t5_2vbli

The whole purpose of the system is to get me places and time is the only variable that matters in that.  Regularity is a small part of time but only if were talking about buses that come once an hour or theres a lot of transfers or something.  The difference to me between a bus that comes every  minutes and a train that comes every  is an extra three minutes in average wait time  if I pay no attention to the schedule at all which is moot because I do.  Capacity on the other hand is pretty meaningless unless the system is completely overloaded.  But it isnt.  Though the buses Ive been on have mostly been well utilized the only time Ive ever been disallowed to board was when I was leaving the U district immediately after a Seahawks game let out.  And we could add more express buses anytime for relatively cheap if we wanted.  Im not cherrypicking anything here.  Youre bringing up variables that I dont value and have no reason to value.  Youve completely failed in demonstrating why I or anyone have a reason to value these things mainly because that isnt possible  I know perfectly well what they are and as an individual rider simply dont value them.

On the one hand these are people often with an addiction or undiagnosed mental issue thats preventing them from keeping a home and a job who live dangerous thankless lives.

Youve found a needle near where your kids play and strangers walking around your house.  Its scary and unhygienic.  Theres not really a good answer unfortunately.

A real scientist is not going to compare two vastly different programs such as the polio vaccine and GMOs and claim that any one who opposed one or the other the other is antiscience or that calling for more research is anti science... Oh the irony.That is ideology and not science. Science always leaves room for doubt. And in this case the food supply which appears now to be causing huge issues for many people because of scientific recommendations like eat less fat eat less this eat more milk eat more soypeople care about food a lot and demand a much higher burden of proof.It is precisely the ideological tone that raised my hackles as I am very familiar with it. I am also familiar with how poorly it works. If you truly cared about convincing people you would bring out study after study funded by multiple groups every time. You would be willing to wait  yearsnobody will die of lack of genetically modified strawberries in the meantime. You would avoid making absolute claims that are so general as to be meaningless in such a technical discussion patent trolling exists without GMOs yes but it makes patent trolling of the food supply possiblenot unique?

They lost.and yet the state legislature continues to not fund Basic Education at the level that they are legally required to do so.Since a given school can supplement basic education teaching by fund raising by the PTA tutors and volunteering in the classroom parents the schools that are the hardesthit are the low income neighborhoods. Those neighborhoods tend to have fewer parents with the financial resources to donate time andor money to supplement their childrens education. It only gets worse in those neighborhoods as the parents with the means to do so take their kids out of the public schools and put them into private schools.

9920095,0,t1_dazvt3f,KazanI appreciated our discussion along multiple threads in this post. Even though the election is over I still feel strongly that were only going to survive as a society if we can keep talking about points of disagreement with civility and reason. So thank you for entertaining the thoughts of someone who you clearly disagree with strongly. ....gtthe fundamental problem that it is draining funds from public schools  that are often suffering due to funding problems because how we fund them  and putting it into private coffers.I agree that public vs private funding is a perplexing issue for many industries and necessary components of society. However I disagree that there is some inherent good in the public option and conversely inherent evil in the private option. The school voucher system is a good example of this false dichotomy. In states with school choice if a student chooses to attend a charter program there is no cost to the public school for the missing student. The money the state would spend to pay the teacher and the school is instead spent on the charter school. Who benefits? The same people just under a different roof! The student gets an equivalent or better education charter teachers can be paid and everyone benefits. The dollars spent on a charter student are the same dollars allocated if that student chose a public school. If the charter school can not provide the same level of education as the public option it would not exist. There is no profit motive in a charter school system. This isnt GE or Monsanto that were propping up here. ,SeattleWA,db0m3j4,1,t5_2vbli

They tried fixing it by building an upper deck with limited onoff ramps. Theyre now trying to fix other area roads by building toll roads but no one here really wants to pay to take the tolls either. Theyve even tried this diverging diamond intersection up in Round Rock a few miles north of Austin which has resulted in some real fun when people from out of town andor the drunks are on the road.But ultimately the answer really is we have more space. San Antonio is a city with a population of . million people. There are a lot of main roads but more highercapacity collector roads than official arterial roads even here that are  lanes in each direction with speed limits of mph. Houston San Antonio and DallasFort Worth all have very good ringsloops.Austin like Seattle lacks that loop setup and also has very bad eastwest arterials for the most part.

So if one thinks Nationally its really unfair to create another hardred state with  senators and a congressman.  But if one thinks locally even though King County seems to fund Eastern Washington more than the opposite and even though King County has some legitimate gripes that it cant get anything done it wants to because of the deadweight of the rural district holding us back one can also cite things Im sure that East of the Mountains thinks it cannot do because of all those god damn libtards in Seattle doing whatever it is we do thats so rotten to your quality of life other than subsidize you with our taxes.,SeattleWA,dbqjvs1,7,t5_2vbli

10150020,0,t1_dbuivdv,gt There are many countries with backwards forms of governments and incorrect societies which lead their citizens to make decisions which end poorly in this case Im talking about terrorismAt the risk of setting a new speed record for taking a thread from  to GodwinHow do you feel about immigrants who fled Germany to come to the US in the late s? Do you think they were fleeing a tyrannical government or were they coming to America to spread a backwards ideology and we should have prevented them? I view immigrants and refugees from Muslimmajority countries in much the same way  theyre fleeing oppression and trying to improve their lives and their childrens future which is the universal human impulse. I cant fault anyone for doing that.When the immigrants are Muslim theres some fear that theyre bringing a foreign religion here. The same argument was made about Irish immigration to the US during the th century when we were an overwhelmingly Protestant country.So what were left with is that the immigration in the past was people with white skin and current immigration is people with brown skin.

10173017,0,t1_dbwpy9w,I think electronic ordering like this is a win win for everyone on either side of the counter and Ive been on either side of the counter.For the back of house and the server it has the potential to eliminate a lot of confusion and miscommunication. A restaurant could also use it as a gatekeeper to limit the amount of substitutions and offmenu ordering which can seriously screw up the flow speed and efficiency of a kitchen.A server if any can still quality check the food ensure that the orders match the ticket and work more tables and provide better service. The same number of servers in a restaurant would have more time to refill drinks bus tables etc. Sure in reality this might mean less servers per tables but if a restaurant manager were smart theyd use electronic ordering to increase the quality and speed of service for roughly the same wage cost.For the customer they dont have to wait for a server and do that whole interrogation and  questions game and they can clearly pick out and customize their order. In a sense Dennys has been doing this for years by using big dumb menus with lots of pictures. You can be in there at  in the morning and totally drunk and just point at a picture. Sonic is kind of the same way with their pictographic menus and carside ordering.However robotic food prep is coming for sure. Its already extensively used in the packaged and processed food industry with pick and place deltabots with high quality machine vision. And highly labor intensive tasks like say cleaning a bunch of dried beans or popcorn kernels has been automated for a couple of decades now by using airjet sorting systems combined with high speed computer vision.Even farm production is now highly automated. Newer tractors plows and harvesters can basically pilot themselves with pinpoint accuracy and following counter farming as well as gathering field data metrics about everything from soil moisture to pH levels to fertilizer quantities and just about anything else you can measure and log.There are even dairy farms that are almost entirely automated from feeding to stall mucking to automatic milking stations. The cows know when they have too much milk and they quickly learn they can just go to the automated station wait in line and enter an enclosed stall where robots do everything from washing the teats and udders to attaching the milking device and then each batch of milk from an individual cow is analyzed for the quality of milk and health diagnostics like infections.My main question about automation is how this fits into our society and what this post scarcity economy means for capitalism and the nature of work. At some point were going to be forced to look at universal basic income just because there arent enough jobs left to go around.And if we dont look at and even consider UBI well this is how people end up storming the metaphorical and literal Bastille.

10214539,0,t1_dc1rgcf,Yeah of course. Sexual Assault  campus policy or campus procedure at least is that if youre sexually assaulted or raped you bring it to campus leadership and they will contact authorities if needed. Unsurprisingly they never deem it needed keeping statistics low and allowing those sweet tuition dollars from both parties to keep rolling in.Racism  There was a semipublicized case where a group of high school students of color visited campus and were basically harassed by bookstore employees. The school handled it fairly poorly. Conflicts of Interest  The director of Greek life who gets to decide if an organization is kicked off campus is a prominent alumnus of and active participant in the fraternity on campus best known for throwing bottles at gay kids walking down the street date rape drugs at parties hazing pledges etc. Thanks to the directors role this fraternity is still on campus while others have been kicked off or suspended for lesser transgressions than theyre guilty of and have been proven guilty of.Classismgeneral elitism  This one is anecdotal but I think representative of campus climate. I was on a committee as a student with a bunch of faculty and leadership. Someone mentioned the universitys published goal of increasing diversity on campus especially through admission of local students its been a fairly controversial deal for awhile now that a school in such a diverse area brings in so few students from local high schools. A faculty member said Well it doesnt really line up with our goal of academic achievement. The whole room agreed with him.Suppressing student voicescensorship  While I was a student this article was published. Basically it criticized the school for naming a new campus building after the Weyerhauser family alumnimajor donors of the school when they make such a huge stinking deal about being so sustainable and green. This issue of the student newspaper was published the day that the Board of Trustees had a meeting on campus...which included at least one member of the Weyerhauser family. IIRC the student body presidents were then forced to run around campus early that morning collecting all the newspapers so that the Trustees wouldnt see them and be offended.Basically the university considers itself to be this shining example of integrity and liberal thought they call themselves the Harvard of the West when in reality they are guilty of all the hypocrisy and alumnipandering of most US colleges made worse by the year price tag. If you want to only admit rich white kids not pursue rape cases and treat minority students like shit fine. Just own it dont claim that gtA Puget Sound education both academic and cocurricular encourages a rich knowledge of self and others an appreciation of commonality and difference the full open and civil discussion of ideas thoughtful moral discourse and the integration of learning preparing the universitys graduates to meet the highest tests of democratic citizenship. ,SeattleWA,dc1vjd6,8,t5_2vbli

Secrest WSBA No.  admitted  of Shaker Heights OH was suspended from the practice of law in the State of Washington for a period of  days effective July   by order of the Washington State Supreme Court following approval of a stipulation. This discipline is based on conduct involving failure to act diligently failure to respond to requests for information failure to disclose suspension status and failure to withdraw from representation. gt In fall of  Ms. Secrest moved to Ohio but continued to maintain her practice in Tacoma Washington as a public defender. Between fall  and May  Ms. Secrest was flying between Washington and Ohio monthly staying approximately two weeks in each state. gt In May  Client A hired Ms. Secrest to represent him in a child custody matter and paid her . In August  Ms. Secrest filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the mothers impending move and a proposed parenting plan. On October   Mother filed a motion to modify the parenting plan however she did not perfect service until December   when Ms. Secrest waived service in court. On December   Ms. Secrest attended a hearing on the motion for temporary restraining order the trial on the motion was set for June  . On December   Ms. Secrest attended a hearing on Mothers motion to modify the parenting plan. gt From May  through September  Ms. Secrest did not travel to Washington. Ms. Secrest maintained her mailing address in Tacoma since she continued to have cases there but she only got her mail when she came to Tacoma. This resulted in Ms. Secrest not receiving some of the correspondence which was sent to her Tacoma address. In early  Ms. Secrests telephone number and the email address she had listed with the Association became inactive. Client A was never informed that Ms. Secrest had a new phone number and that her old email address was no longer active. When Client A was unable to reach Ms. Secrest Client A contacted a lawyer who was a mutual friend. That lawyer contacted Ms. Secrest and asked to her to be in contact with Client A. Client A reached Ms. Secrest through a different email on January   Ms. Secrest replied to Client As email on January   and gave him her new phone number and apologized. Ms. Secrest did not appear at five hearings held in fall  and winter  on Client As matter but sent another lawyer in her place on three occasions October   February   and March  . No one appeared on Client As behalf on October   and October   but Client A was present at the October   hearing. At the February   hearing the court ordered that there would be no further continuances in the matter. On March   the Court ordered the parties to set up a settlement conference and threatened sanctions due to the parties failure to comply with the case schedule regarding the settlement conference. The settlement conference was rescheduled for the week of May  . On March   Mothers motion for modification was dismissed without prejudice. Neither party confirmed the settlement conference to be held the week of May   and it was stricken. gt On May   Ms. Secrest was administratively suspended for failure to comply with her mandatory continuing legal education MCLE requirements under Admission to Practice Rule APR . Ms. Secrest learned of the suspension on May   but did not notify Client A of the suspension at that time or withdraw from the representation of Client A. Ms. Secrest agrees that she did not communicate with Client A until she sent him an email on June   two days before Client As trial and informed him of her suspension. In that email Ms. Secrest informed Client A that she had discussed the case with one of the lawyers Lawyer who had previously assisted on the case and that Client A should request a continuance of his trial.

Because as everyone knows even those who ardently believe climate change is a serious threat to our wellbeing no one believes we will all die tomorrow as a result of climate change at least no one of sound mind.It literally doesnt make ANY difference if climate change is being debated or not in this context because even if the judge were to take the premise that climate change was a real and present danger he could STILL deny the defense on the grounds of no imminent harm.Therefore inserting the statement about climate change being a tremendous controversy does absolutely nothing to support his ruling.

Im trying to understand them city Folk which is why I grit my teeth and read on this sub every few days. I dont want to spit on anyone if I want to see spittle flying either direction I can just turn on either a liberal or a conservative news channel political bias seems to control which direction the spit flies.  I was trying to comment on this topic in a prior thread and did not express myself well. I acknowledge that SeattleKing pays more than it gets ...most likely because theres a whole bunch of people concentrated in a small area with inflated property values while infrastructure is similarly expensive regardless of whether you build it in a populated area vice in a less populated area. So starting simple by just looking at property taxes how do we change that and make it more fair for Seattle? If somebody died and made me dictator of Snohomish County I want to redirect a more fair share to King County. How do I do thatWhere do I take the money from?  We used to receive a pie chart with our property assessment. About  of property taxes went to schools that was in  they dont chart the pie anymore.  Should we take money from the rural schools? ....wouldnt that just make more uneducated potential Trumptype supporters? I seriously would allocate more money from roads to Seattles transportation because to me it seems it would hurt people less drastically than cutting social services like for instance all the foster farms out here. I could live with a gravel highway. That might kill anyones income that depends on Seattle recreationers is that a word? because they dont want to drive on our spiffy gravel. Seattle can also have our bus which rarely has people on it comes twice a day at totally unusable hours and for me is a twomile walk each way. About this time as the Snohomish dictator Ive probably just been lynched by my dumbass rural neighbors.  Im being somewhat flippant but seriously urban needs are different from rural needs. Is there a way differing requirements can be balanced? Currently Im not feeling too optimistic.,SeattleWA,ddgmu7r,1,t5_2vbli

10740789,0,t1_ddntwp0,gtWhy do you hate women so much? You seem to demean them every chance you get. Can you be a more perfect example of a misogynistic Trump supporter?  Wow like your original dynamic thinker!!   Oh  I must simply know where ever did you get this amazing wit from?  No let me guess your party apparatchik stopped by let you in on the latest empty talking points cooked up the peoples revolutionary virtue signaling brigade?I  like women who are traditional and are actually  feminine features and not females trying to be men and men trying to be women.   Both sides fail miserably when they try this gender bender bullshit.    I can get along with guys that embody masculine traits without getting all weirded out like snowflakes like your self do.  Id rather have a outspoken  guy call me out and challenge me to a fight then  some wormy little pussy thats goanna scheme gossip and  manipulate others in my  social circle.    Thats the sort of thing you deal with working in a heavily female workplace.  Women really do excel and tearing each other down and keeping long drawn out vendettas in the workplace. Ive seen women spend more time gathering support by the other female staff to fuck over their rival and the constant posturing and political maneuvering I witnessed made me wonder how any work got done.  Ive known some women that were hard workers and  good at the job and it actually  hurt their  careers because  they werent politicking  like  other women in the job and  got blamed for other workers fuckups.   Since they were actually working at work instead of maneuvering and politicking they didnt have the safety  net of allies to  stick  up for them when some scheming lazy bitch blame shift a fuck up to one of the few people actually  working.  These ladys didnt do themselves any favors by being younger prettier and most friendly than their older female supervisor that shifted the blame onto the younger females out  of petty jealousy.  I see that these ladies that are always starting this shit are the first to start talking about male chauvinism or the Kyriarchy or whatever the mindless social justice  slogan of the day is.  People are starting realize that this is  just a ruse or a mask that shit people use  to  mask  their presence among  their  future  victims that  they fool into thinking they are advocates and a strong female mentor that  will help protect them from  the big bag patriarchy.  These schemers use their constant virtual signaling to mask that they are shit people from the normies so people dont catch on. These shit people  talking  this BS also seem  to be using these false causes to make themselves feel better and to gain social status as some kind of saint of social justice thats getting martyred for the cause thats helping everyone you just  dont understand how much of a saint they are.   The reality is  youre not virtuous for being a social Justice Warrior or rabid progressive demagogue.  Youre not helping those you profess to care for.your just helping yourself and disguising it as virtue.   Letting unfettered mass migrations from regions that hold radically different ideals from Western ideals isnt going to help those migrants if ultimately they just recreate the problem they are fleeing from nor will it benefit host countries in the long run.   Muslim culture and governance is the source of most of their own countries problems and if they get to recreate it here we will just have more of what the Middle East and now what Europe has.     I believe that very few so called progressives are as ignorant as they pretend about the threat they are encouraging to come here. Im starting to think they just  want to cynically use these Muslim Migrants as a new class of people dependent on the left wing for protection against  the big bad forces of  so called fascism which in truth are nothing more than people who can see the disastrous nation imploding insanity thats goanna end in a nasty vicious civil war that could  have been avoided.   Well avoided if the progressives hadnt been so greedy for power they tried  to  create another captive voting block while pretending to help them with their problems.   Everybody knows the pharmaceutical companys isnt interested in cures for diseases when keeping them on the hook and dependent on what you gives them the real money.  The progressives for all their talk are just like the Pharmaceutical companies. They really dont value the humanity of those they claim to care for but rather strives to keep those groups of  people in its clutches dependent and servile.  The leaders of the Muslims arent so stupid that they dont realize your using them without any real  regard for their wellbeing.   I was told by one of my Muslim  coworkers during one of his many  times preaching to me how I should  join his faith and I brought up  the issue of how do their religious  leaders put up  with all these social  worker types and how it is they get along with local politicians  since they promote things Islam almost universally comdemed in by almost every different Muslim school of thought. I said how is it your allied with people who dont hold to any values that Islam promotes about sexuality and family relations.  I further stated that isnt only people of the book  FYI that term applies to Practicing  Jews and faithful Christians only your allowed to show mercy to and allow to live in your land as dhimmis  that pay extra tax and  he replied  in this manner  I wish you spoke my native  tongue .I get things mixed up when  Im really  angry and trying  to talk in Englishlet me try  to explain these freaky people  think  we are dumb children and our teachers  tell us not to try  to correct their wrong thinking  because they  are gonna be tricked by ALLAH to help us conquer their own  lands Inshallah.     When we get the power then will be the days wear talk  down to them like they now do to us and that day they will give up their wrong actions or will will make them stop.Gee golly sounds like the gullible rd worlder is making plans for the future where his local teachers are gonna instruct them to show the unbelievers and godless the error of  their ways.  Now at first Im sure they will start in a friendly manner but  sooner or later they will get resentful  of  people ignoring their admonishments not to drink alcohol and not to dress immodestly and not to ear Pork..and on and on it goes.   This is where Shari patrols will appear to intimidate people to stop sinning against Allah.  When they start getting arrested they will really ramp it  up and the real  fun begins.   Actions like firebombing the local liquor  store and smashing  up the liqueur at Safeway happens.   Weed shops get smashed up and strip dancing places have   dudes  push their way in with clubs and knives to demolish the place.  Now some places  will  try  to defend themselves  with a gun angainst shit like this.   These rowdy religious brawlers will be protected  by the media  and left wing pandering politicians that will demonise anyone with the nerve to  fight back when attacked by extremist.   Seattle Police could be just  like Londons  Police that  cover  up child sex trafficking rings because it will get the local Muslim  population riled up if we stop them from pimping the Kufirs young girls and women. After all Allah says  raping the nonbelievers women is AOK by  the ALLAH.   Im so glad we are finally catch up to London in street harassment and attaches from Jihadi.Someone who really cared for these folk would talk them into the benefits of western ideals of personal liberty and freedom and make it clear that radical Islam wont be tolerated here so that these folk could actually thrive instead of creating another warzone shithole. That wont happen becaue progressives only care  about how they can use various groups to achieve political gains for themselves.  I guess its all ok if progressivism burns down the kingdom as long as you get to rulers of the ash,SeattleWA,ddntxr4,-1,t5_2vbli

Basically in the vein of Trumps other nominees the Labor Secretary nominee pretty much believes that the department he is supposed to lead shouldnt exist. This is pretty much going to be a fight for their lives for organized labor and this is a tactic which has worked. Back in  one of the main reasons draconian immigration legislation failed was because the Latino community organized a day without immigrants on a massscale across the country on May Day in fact.

Them charging on mobile their own prerogative. But its valid criticism that they still look to charge subscription fees. My opinion is that the Internet took down the inherent value of information. Its monetarily worth less because you can find the same information from many many sources. I would much rather old media goes out of buisness than information becoming less widely available.

10960311,0,t1_deabll2,Thats not true and is not literally our law.  Heres a link to the law. If you havent you should read itThis rcw provides Washington state law enforcement greater protections against prosecution than other states. However the impetus to update this law is based on local incidents where officers were acting in accordance with the law and their duty to arrest suspects who were preparing to assault them with deadly weapons after having committed other crimes  Che Taylor and Andre ThompsonBryson Chaplin.Even with my obviously prolaw enforcement slant I will not defend the actions of officers Burke nor Meade in their decisions to use deadly force where the adjustments to existing law may have led to their prosecution for manslaughtermurder. However decreasing the protections afforded the men and women who are duty bound to respond to dangerous chaotic and rapidly evolving situations will have unintended consequences. Its obvious there is a growing belief that police use deadly force more often than is necessary.  Data collected and analyzed by The Washington Post indicated that the vast majority of deadly force encounters nationwide involve armed and assaultive suspects. The narrative that Americas police are trigger happy thugs looking to get away with murder simply isnt true. I realize my beliefs go against what I perceive to be the prevailing opinion on the sub.

Im not sure what came of it but they did respond quickly.Of course I dont know all of the details  so I could have been witness to a murder.

There are lots of jobs with high salaries that are attracting a lot of newcomers to the area.  Are economic fundamentals driving this?  Hard to say I mean why is SeattleWest Coast more attractive than other locations?  Partially because there is a dearth of opportunities elsewhere so there could be a bubble in fact w as many people that are positive there isnt a bubble I suspect that there actually is one it just isnt easily visible my contrarian side coming out....BTW  there is probably a bubble in student loan debt.
