20099,0,t1_cegpmr3,Might I suggest trying to splurge on a bottle from Domaine des Monts Luisant which is the younger wine that I tasted recently.  Seriously it was one of the most amazing wines Ive had in a long long time. ,wine,cegpz6g,1,t5_2qhs8
36230,0,t1_ceigut3,I agree that Jura wines offer great value and can be fun and exciting wines.  The problem lays with marketing them to non winesavvy guests.  Jura wines are not really something a majority of restaurants can be successful with.  IMO it takes either a highly wine educated market NY SF CHI etc or a niche restaurant in a smaller relatively educated market.  I ran a very successful niche program in a small market.  I tried some Jura and Savoie wines on our list.  We tried many different ways to sell them pairings on tasting menus flights pouring samples for guests with their meals.  We did not do very well to my dismay.  I sat on the  cases for an average of  months each time whether it was Jacquere Chardonnay Gamay Trousseau or Poulsard.  Im not trying to compare their pour through rate with butterbomb chardonnay either.  Usually with a fun wine I was happy to go through  cases a month.  It was a challenging hand sell and thats for a  seat restaurant with  sommeliers on the floor.gt I used to drink Westy when it was available in bars and stores circa . Probably the last time I had it was at Ginger Man in NYC for  bucks. Worth every cent. Sadly my state was not included in the limited release that was done last year.. Im extremely jealous!  . I didnt get any from this release either.  gt I gladly spend  on a bottle of Clos Sainte Hune  ...  But even if you could afford it seeing a  bottle for over  at a restaurant is harsh. Agreed!  That is extremely harsh.  And no way I would pay that either.  Last time I bought CSH for my wine list I got it at  IIRC and it went on the list at .  I bought  bottles and sat on them for   years selling one when I finally just bought the other  at cost and took them home.  But that is anecdotal.  Back to my point. In your example of a  being  on a wine list I would never buy wine from that restaurant either.  That is ridiculous.  That is over a  time markup from the RETAIL price.  Retail markup is usually . times cost of goods COG restaurant is typically  times COG.  Therefore a restaurant price is typically twice retail.  Any restaurant that is trying to charge more than that is one I wouldnt buy wine at either.  Totally agreed.gt Im talking from the point of view of the guy thats looking at the menu trying to figure out what to order.Great point.  Lets explore that. Im shooting from the cuff here and its been a long day of working and studying so forgive me if this is a choppy thought.One perception issue I have found that laypeople encounter is immediate information without context.  The internet has been amazing at bringing people closer to the goods they desire at lower prices than they see in their local store.  It has done this by mostly. eliminating the need for high dollar per square foot retail space.  On the web SEO SEO SEO trumps location location location.   . They also reduce cost by cutting the need of hiring a sales force.  . And lets not forget my personal favorite letting people shop from home in their PJs!  These are all avenues of cost cutting that are difficult if not impossible for restaurants to duplicate.  This can leave people with the IMO false perception that they are being ripped off.  They see a bottle on a wine list for  and type it into their smart phone and find it online for .  They dont understand the context that the shop they are buying from has much lower overhead to cover.These are the reasons I get my hair up when I hear people say Restaurants are a ripoff!  Its like when a reddit hiveminder posts that all wine tasting is bullshit.  They are making a snap judgement without proper context.  I apologize if Ive come off as abrasive in my responses.  I truly do appreciate the discourse!  ,wine,ceik1h3,1,t5_2qhs8

160788,0,t1_cewp1e4,In short California wine industry is already experiencing a bit of collapse due to economic and governmental factors and environmental factors will finish off a lot of struggling businesses.  Small producers worst affected  vineyards and wineries alike.  Venture capital projects like Catherine Hall will be the first midsized companies to tank hard.Not necessarily a bad thing!  More boomer retirees and hobbyists exiting the industry makes room for another generation of skilled winemakers and vineyard managers from Cornell UC Davis and WSU to step up whether working on their own or for one of the huge producers. Kendall Jackson Gallo Mondavi Phillip Morris etc.Varietals...  Need to be more cautious about clonal selections.  State really needs a dedicated plant breeding program in order to create true Californian wine grapes or to just embrace GMOs.  French and German varieties more delicate and less forgiving.  Would put my money on Italian and Spanish wines from central California going forward.  Growers should also consider rootstock selection for a number of factors especially with regards to how they effect scions drought tolerance biotic pest tolerance and uniform budbreak timing and berry maturation.  Pinots are all fucked.Sustainable practices... Drip irrigation mist irrigation stop discing the soil aeroponics for greenhouse projects BETTER LEAFROLL VIRUS AND PHYLLOXERA CONTROLS as they basically choke plants to death better overall pest management no more landscape architecture more efficient trellising systems like lyre or GDC... Theres a ton they could be doing.Future for California Next couple years is grim from what Ive seen but theyll pull it out eventually through economic darwinism and sheer marketing power.  It absolutely cannot continue unchecked simple because that would be physically impossible.All is not lost!  Washington has plans to double planted wine grape acreage over the next ten years New York has the best plant breeding program in the country Oregon probably has the absolutely most talented winemakers and vineyard managers this side of the Atlantic Montana is making some of the weirdest and most exciting stuff Ive ever tasted so the American wine industry will be just fine if the mega quake finally hits and the earth swallows Napa.

239488,0,t3_1wtc86,One point made in the article regarding the bubbles in champagne or other sparkling wine potentially causing headaches has something to it even if it wasnt explained. Carbonation stimulates the Pyloric valve the entrance into the intestines and as little alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream through the stomach this causes alcohol to pass into the intestines far quicker speeding up intoxication.

278523,0,t3_1xa4go,I would probably take a slighty different approach than others here are advocating. Rather than focus on  bottles at bottle I would focus on  bottles at  bottle and maybe throw in a few blind two buck chucks if you want to up the bottle count to reintroduce the getting wasted element discussed in some of the other comments. Your mileage may vary of course but after organizing numerous tastings I have come to the conclusion that it is better to have a mix of lowerend and higherend bottles than bottles of consistent middling quality of course consistent mindblowing quality is best!. Assuming a budget of  I would probably do something like this. on a wellselected red Burgundy. Pavelot and Rossignol are pretty good values on this front.  on a wellselected German Riesling from a top producer. IMO German Rieslings are some of the best values in the wine world and you can easily get some of the best the region has to offer in this price range. Donnhoff JJ Prum and JJ Chrisoffel are just a few of the names to look for.  on a Rioja with some bottle age on it from a reputable producer. Lopez de Heredia might fit the bill nicely.  on a wellselected Rhone wine or a nice Loire white. Anyway whatever varietals you might choose I would definitely allocate the majority of the budget to a few higher end bottles rather than buy  bottles in the  price range. ,wine,cf9mqrv,3,t5_2qhs8

I want badly for this to be true but it isnt. So Ive invented a convenient out for myself courtesy of Adam Gopnik which is that the wines sold in supermarkets are beverages not wine. As soon as you slap on the cute label picked by the focus group put together by your ad agency as soon as you commit to making something that will be predictably the same every time you taste it youre making a beverage not a wine.

884033,0,t3_2484it,youareterriblemurial has the right idea. Short term goals should probably be focused DTC. which if you are in MA and trying to sell in MA then I cant speak to how that works. All I know is that an outside winery trying to ship intosell in MA is a nightmare with the state liquor laws. In Washington for instance what you are doing is considered custom crush. The wine is made for you on spec and bottled by another winery with their name on the bottling statement required by the TTB unless they amend their basic permit with your trade name and you are allowed to register as a wholesalerdistributor with the state. That only allows you to sell wholesale so restaurants wine shops and the like. Im not entirely sure if you can sell to a distributor at that point but you cant sell retail or DTC. You are working within the second tier of the three tier system. You could get it into Trader Joes and such but thats it. If you want to sell retail and DTC where all the margin is then you have to register as a bonded winery or a bonded wine cellar. The winery requires you to actually ferment something but the wine cellar allows you to buy bulk blend and bottle. This and again Im speaking from WA allows you to sell retail dtc wholesale and to distributors. But then you have to invest in tanks and find a bottling line in MA.Self distributing in MA is probably doable as a wholesaler or retailer but if you want to move beyond that as a retailer youd get distributors or try and self distribute if possible but as a wholesaler youd have to register in each state as a distributor. If you thought shipping licenses where fun in each state wait till you try to register as a distributor.I would definitely try and find someone who is doing the same thing as you and pick their brain if they are willing. One thing to note though that if you do go national and choose the distributor route or any other level that relies on placements be prepared to grow as need arises and know that it will never stop. The minute that you cant fill a placement is the day you lose a placement and getting a new one is a lot harder than keeping the old one.Best of luck!,wine,ch4rni7,2,t5_2qhs8

OK I suppose Ill admit to prefering some of the really obscure very smalltime producers in Bourgogne that few have ever heard of that sell on the East Coast US for ltUSD. But Ive got a better idea for you. Cruise on down to your locally owned independent brick n mortar bottle shop and ask the good folks there for  Pinot Noirs from around the globe as a sampler of what is out there. Maybe specify youd like bottles in the  range or a six pack or case that costs X total. Then just see what they come up with. If you are lucky and they are good you might wind up with samples from Bourgogne France Russian River Valley CA Willamette Valley OR Colchaqua Valley Chile New Zealand and if you are really lucky perhaps even Wagram Austria. Now try them and see what you like and then maybe repeat the request next month with even more focus.,wine,chcdzbz,3,t5_2qhs8

1362900,0,t3_29ngeg,First off congratulations on the wedding! My wife and Ive been doing this for about  years now and wanted to share a few insights. First as others have said there isnt really a wrong answer for a  year timeline. I have however been party to two missteps and can share some of my hitsmisses.  First make sure that the wine is stored someplace cool and dark. I had a french red go bad after  years because it was in the sun in a warm apartment. Now I keep longeraging wines in a small fridge and the others are fine in a dark basement. Second it could be a mistake to invest too much in a single bottle of wine. My Dad had a  Bordeaux that sat for years and years and years waiting for the right moment. We opened it at a dinner and it was past its prime. This made me a huge fan of getting many good wines to have one each year instead of one bigdeal wine that can be hitormiss. Our biggest anniversary hits have been getting flights of the same wine to have every year for the next   or even  years. This let us taste how the same wine developed over a number of years and gave us a nice annual tradition. It was also cool wrapping up bottles in newspaper with dates  years in the future and thinking we might gasp have kids on that date. Those days have since passed the wine was great and now weve got bottles downstairs waiting for the kid to graduate high school shes . We mostly I picked a few different wines. In the early years we bought Chateauneuf de Pape CDP since wed had it when dating and enjoyed it. We went with an a Chanti Classico next since it was from our wedding year. I splurged on cases of Napa Cabernet and CNDP in  from our daughters birth year of  for us to enjoy from    a bottle. Most of the varietals were chosen using Robert Parkers wine chart to find regions that had good vintages in the relevant years. You can also look in the back of Wine Spectator to get a sense of what vintages will last  years and when theyll be ready. Our first batch of CNDP was a bit young. We usually spent about  a bottle but Im sure people here could recommend some  or so bottles that might have  years of evolution in them. Sorry for the super long answer but this annual bottle of wine is one of our highlights. Weve had good amp bad accompanied with feasts of steak or hamburger but it has been a great accompaniment to mark our time together. Cheers!,wine,cin4njh,1,t5_2qhs8

1396786,0,t3_2a49vn,I work at a winery. The advantage to having a wineclub is that its a subscription service so its guaranteed income for the winery the length of the contract. We take the opportunity to send out new releases and seasonal bottles so our wine club members have incentive to join they get the experience before others and have access to special and seasonally appropriate bottles without having to visit us. We send them with recipes and recommended pairings for added value.

2462252,0,t1_cmg04ch,dYquem benefits from exceptional topography aiding the formation of noble rot. Fog is common which keeps the heat and humidity quite high. I went to Sauternes a few years ago and the fog was amazing. The terroir is superb and really aids semillon. The vinification is impeccable. Berry selection is the standard. I read somewhere that a vine of Sauvignon produces a couple of bottles  year old Cabernet vines of great quality produce less than a bottle and a dYquem vine produces less than a glass. Because its late harvested the chances of rain are higher at harvest so dYquem use low hovering helicopters to sit above the pickers to reduce the water content of the harvest so the juice isnt diluted. Thats pretty serious and no doubt adds significantly to both the quality and price of the final product.  Ive drunk dYquem on a few occasions mostly halfs and it really is very very good. I also have had the misfortune of opening a ml  to find it corked. This was on the same day I opened a  Penfolds Grange and it was corked too. This was not a good day.,wine,cmg1a6i,5,t5_2qhs8

Put to the side to let it open up but even after about  minutes in the glass it was still closed. Soft tannins surprisingly very red fruit forward cherry raspberry little to no oak. Was just average. Cascina Ballarina  This wine was very accessible tons of ripe red fruit nice earthiness. Tannins were a little more aggressive than the Manzone. Put to the side and revisited about  minutes later. Really opened up I think the wine has serious potential.  Rivers Marie Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir Took about  minutes for my boss to call Sonoma coast Pinot Riper than I want but I am just starting to get to know Pinot. Not as textured as some of the other Pinot I have drank recently. Cherry little bit of Raspberry the oak was there and a little bit overbearing of the fruit.  Dante Rivetti Bricco de Nueis Barberesco  This stuff was incredible tons of complexity in the nose ripe red fruits sandalwood herbs little bit of mineral. On the tongue the wine was so awesome texture was beautiful lots of fruit menthol. Tannins were very soft at this point. One of the best wines I have had. My first introduction into aged Nebbiolo. I loved it. Tablas Creek Rouge  Tablas Creek is one of the few wineries I have actually been to. I really enjoy their wines my buddy gave this bottle to me for my birthday. We didnt blind it just popped and poured. Unfortunately it was over the hill. Little bit of oxidation and very dead in the mouth. Was a bummer but still fun to try. Franciscan Napa Valley Merlot  My neighbor gave me this bottle when they moved out. You could tell it was stored a little hot but it was showing pretty decent. This wine was a beast. The tannins were incredibly grippy high acids and tons of oak. Nice aromas roasemary red fruits and oak.  Reyvaan The Contender  This wine was close to WOTN for me if you take the  Barberesco out of the picture it was the best wine we tried. Tons of smoked meat bacon fat dark fruit and scorched earth. Ripe blue and black fruit with high tannins and great minerality. This wine was a little bit Primary I imagine in  to  years it is going to be absolutely stunning. Was a pleasure to try hoping I can pick up a bottle or two to lay down. St. Supery Reserve Rutherford Ranch Cab  This wine was awesome. Ripe blue and black fruit loamy earth sweet tannins.

3846365,0,t3_34hgqb,So we got our allocation of the Ganevat wines a couple weeks ago and Ive been dying to try one but the prices are a bit steep this year so I kept putting it off. Well tonight I finally brought home the Jean Francois Ganevat Julien en Billat  which as far as I can make out is a cuvee made from two plots of Pinot Noir the first is the plot that usually makes up the majority of his Cuvee Julien which consists of  year old vines planted on clay and limestone and the  year old plot that usually makes up the En Billat which is planted on schist and marl. This particular parcel was planted by Ganevat at a high altitude and the very lowyield grapes are destemmed by hand and allowed to macerate for an extended period.The wine is definitely dynamic and changed immensely over the course of five hours or so. The color is awesome and the photo doesnt do it justice as it has a glowing magenta core with shades of pink near the rim. The nose is a bit more simple than the palate with focused cherry and a slight earthy note. This shines on the palate with a beautiful core of cherry with edges of cinnamon and dried leaves and a wonderful menthe note. After a few hours a nice mineral note shines through in the mid palate that feels like a mix between stones and and a metallic sense. Well structured but seamlessly integrated so that this is pleasurable from first sip and the tannins are only felt slightly as a dusty sensation on the rear palate and the acid provides more lift to the fruit than any tartness.This is one of those wines with obvious flaws and yet they all work well together and produce a well balanced and beautiful wine. When first opened there was a touch of effervescence that was a bit worrying but it blew off in  minutes or so and the wine continued to develop beautifully over the course of the evening. Im going to vacupump it and revisit it tomorrow to see how it develops over night.,wine,cqupx9n,3,t5_2qhs8
3849553,0,t1_cqv1xld,Hes been making a name for himself in the last few years partly because his vinification methods are so traditional and partly because of the scarcity of his wines. Wine Terriors did an in depth piece on him a few years ago. The prices have definitely risen over the last few years. The first year we brought his wines in they sat on the shelf at  to  for even his most sought after wines. This year we received  wines and they sit on the shelves at  and these arent even his most popular wines. Which brings up a great point is the wine worth the money? In this case I think it is lack of availability more than quality of the wines. Thats not to say that the wines arent good because they are last year I had a few bottles of his Les Chalasses Vieilles Vignes which is made from  year old vines and it was one of the best Chardonnays Ive ever had but Ive definitely had better Pinots than this for less money. That being said I may take one more of these home to lay down for a few years and see how it ages so I suppose I find value in it even if the price is high. ,wine,cqv312w,2,t5_2qhs8

5184702,0,t1_cvaxsi7,gt You mentioned vintage ports in your post but OP also mentioned tawny ports. What is the difference or what is tawny compared to vintage port? Quality Tawny Ports are aged in oak casks for between  and  years.  Tawny ports are ready to drink as soon as they are bottled.  Because they are aged in wood they exhibit nutty and dried fruit flavors. Vintage Ports are aged in oak barrels for two years before bottling and the remainder of their life aging in bottle.  Because they spend most of their life aging in bottle you get more of a dark fruity character.  A very simple analogy would be to think of Vintage Port as being more winelike and Tawny Port as more Cognaclike in terms of flavor profile.,wine,cvay3mw,8,t5_2qhs8

Similarly young Grand Crus almost always need a decant in my experience. With respect to Bordeaux I think it depends in large part on age.

5695461,0,t3_3syaha,So I picked up my wine from Fred Scherrer this past week. It was sitting on the counter as I was making dinner and a friend walked in with a surprise out of the blue. He works at Kosta Brown and they were apparently given a bunch of these older Fetzer wines and most werent showing well.Fetzer Lolonis Zinfandel The cork slid out in one piece so easily that we laughed assuming it to be done. It poured a murky brick red like muddyclay water and a strange funk had us joking again about it being way gone. After less than two minutes it cleaned up though and had our attention. In a few more minutes it went from just being interesting to seriously enjoyable. Notes of dried red fruitfaint and really hard to pin down cedar lots of baking spice carameltoffee claylike minerality and a faint savory tomatotomato leaf character.The palate was surprisingly alive but soft. It whispered rather than shouted. Mouthcoating tannins were about as resolvedfine as they get. Like a fine layer of dust. Still good enough acidity to keep the wine refreshing and and the glass tipping towards my mouth. After taking a bite of a roasted mushroom the umami really gave the wine a breath of life and seemingly fleshed out the body.When first poured we noticed some poppingslight fizzing that would last a few seconds. I wasnt sure if it was disolved co or what. It could have been something that contributed to keeping the wine in good shape for so long.I brought a Scherrer Shale Terrace Zinfandel .I had been by the winery earlier in the week and was looking at their library wines. Fred told me that the Shale Terrace block of their vineyard produced a more Pinotlike style of Zin which is all I needed to hear. He also mentioned that this was the only vintage he could remember where none of the fruit was raisined. He was actually dead on with the description. A buddy pointed out some similarities to Russian River Pinots.This was way more vibrantlivelyyoung than the Fetzer but still had some tertiary notes going on. Stewed red fruit earthinessmushroom and oakspice on the nose. A somewhat inconsistent palate of fresh juicy cherrycranberry general old wine character starting to come out more noticeable tannin and a hint of alcohol which may have been accentuated by the foodharissa roasted carrots not the best pairing. This has at least  years left of development and Im going to see if I can pick up a few more.Dinner duck leg quarter roasted assortment of mushrooms and herbs parboiled and roasted carrots with a harissa glaze,wine,cx32rql,6,t5_2qhs8

5825796,0,t1_cxj9yoq,I agree with points A and B but wine is not simply a solution of acid...like I said its a buffer a mixture of weak acids AND their conjugate bases.  The pH of the solution is governed by the Henderson Hasselbalch equation.  Where the concentration of water cancels out on both sides...thus the ratio of acidconjugate base determines the pH rather than the concentrations of these components.  Its complicated...fundamentally we agree.  OP is singling out acid or pH its not clear what exactly they think they mean...but with residual water ALL of the components of the wine will be diluted acids tannin sugars etc.Edit  Distilled point  Saying that adding a bit of water to wine changes its pH like OP did indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of wine chemistry.

5947310,0,t3_3wt33c,Well Im honest. I tell them We dont have any sweet wines here. However we have some wines that are very fruitforward.Heres what years of experience in a tasting room have taught me many people identify fruit with sweetness. Theyll taste that Sauv blanc and go Oh its sweet. No its not sweet  its almost bone dry. But its very fruitforward with some passion fruit citrus etc.  grapefruit on some years. So their brain which associates fruit with sweetness tricks them and tells them its sweet.Some of those people do end up liking dry white wines or dry ross if they are very fruitforward. Theyll taste that Viognier and really enjoy it then when I tell them its dry technically that wine isnt at . RS but its still below the average threshold their eyes just go wide.But some just like sugar. To those guys I just dont even bother pouring any wine unless they insist. I will be honest and tell them all our wines are dry you probably wont like them if you only like sweet wines sorry.Some are willing to try. Some know they just like the sticky stuff.Just be polite courteous dont be condescending but no need for them to waste their time or dollars  and yours.,wine,cxz80sb,5,t5_2qhs8

6221271,0,t1_cywqrxm,Yes I agree the youve tried xx so youll like xx is one of the best and valid recommendations.  The reason Im asking is I run a commercial software for wine stores Vintelligence and we are constantly doing UIUX edits to simplify the wine buying process. The thing is human beings are so influenced by personal perception and taste it is hard to get an objective good or bad.  When many sommeliers describe wine it seems objective.  However there were many tests done where white wine is dyed red and the experts in question didnt realize  that they were drinking the same wine twice or  that one of the red wines they were drinking was actually a white wine. I suspect that the average wine consumer would assert that there is little more objectively different than white vs red wines.So it begs the question why would so many people become licensed when theyre told that the things theyre describing are emotional responses not objective characteristics of the wine?Not saying theres anything wrong with becoming licensed and learning the beauties of wine.  Id argue its equally as tough to objectively rate art film literature music.  ,wine,cywshu9,2,t5_2qhs8

6263014,0,t3_412i54,Things I likeThe host is a good taster and nice to listen to. This is obviously the most important thing that needs to be right for a wine tasting channel to work. The second video you posted the wine pouring one was pretty amusing. A series of short wine tips joke videos like this would probably work. I like that youre filming outside. A little different than most wine channels Ive seen. Things I think could be betterThe sun seemed like it was in his eyes. Maybe try a different angle for him to sit? The music was pretty bad and distracting. It was like a two second loop that played for six minutes straight. It was also way to fast it didnt match the hosts tone at all. Id like a better mic on the host. Speaking of sound stuff the little snickers from the camera guy in the short video took away from the humor. I think it would have worked better if everyone involved seemed like they were taking the pouring tips seriously even though its obviously terrible advice. Laughing at your own joke ruins the dry humor it could have had going for it. Speaking of humor tips I personally didnt like the  seconds of monty python music and bad dragon ball z effects in the full length episode. I get that youre trying to establish a light hearted tone but it needs to happen faster and should hopefully somehow be funnier. I just wanted things to get going. Overall I think you do have something going here. I like what youre trying to do  a lighthearted wine channel that will appeal to people under  with a knowledgeable likeable host with plenty to talk about. A few tweaks and I think youll have something special. Please keep it up Id like to see more of it posted in this sub. EDIT I went back and watched the Syrah episode. The intro wasnt as annoying but it still wasnt great and I still think you should lose the monty python music. I like that you vary your locations very cool. Keeps it fresh.

When Shakespeare compares his lover to a summers day he doesnt really mean that she or he is like a summers day in that she is hotter in the middle and cooler in the endthough then again he might. Wine writing is of the same type a series of elaborately plausible compliments paid to wines. When the French wine writer Eric Glatre declares say that in the aroma of a bottle of Krug intense empyreumatic fragrances of toasted milk bread fresh butter caf au lait and afterthoughts of linden join in a harmonious chorus with generous notes of acacia honey mocha and vanilla he is suggesting that of all the analogies out there this might be one that expands our minds opens our horizons delights our imaginations.

6708769,0,t3_47h4jb,Stelvins are manufactured with liners with similar oxygen transmission rates to cork. Because of this the ageing process will be relatively similar. AusNZ have been rocking screwcaps on high end reds for a couple decades now and they seem great. As the other commenter said no cork taint issues obviously but the best advantage is a lack of bottle variation. The ability of corks to form a good closure can vary moderately from bottle to bottle whereas the variability of screw caps is much less as long as they are applied properly. This means the wines stay relatively similar to each other as they age. Cork closed bottles can be very different after years of ageing based on the cork alone. Anyways they shouldnt be weird at all.

FOR SHAME.When the shame becomes tok much and I havr some extra time...I like to do a nice balsamic glaze anf red wine reduction from time to time. Its delicious on quite possibly most everything literally everything salads meats fruit ice cream...some people say they would eat a a brick if it was deep fried jusy throw one in a vat of balsamic glaze and watch me go to town.

6878811,0,t3_49xmg3,As I was in the area last year I stopped on a whim in Ammerschwihr on a Sunday morning as Kaefferkopf is one of my favorite wines from Alsace. We were able to taste most of the wines from the domain without feeling pressed to buy anything. We left with more than  bottles anyway as the wine was so good and quite inexpensive! I think you can show up in most villages in the area without any appointment and get a tasting but if you absolutely want to go to a particular house a phone call can ensure that you wont be disappointed. ,wine,d0w0zjt,1,t5_2qhs8
6884446,0,t3_49xumi,I mentioned a few weeks ago about going to a Charles Smith meet and greettasting. Went on Tuesday. Snooze fest. It was set up horribly he had about  wines to taste through including some new single vineyards which Ill mention later but was behind the bar pouring so it was more of a bartenderpatron situation. His groupies stood at the front and prevented anyone else from speaking towith him. He did make one remark about the second floor lingerie department music and had them change it to classic rock. The wines the single vin. chards were tasty but not  at cost tasty I work retail so margin and retail cost are foremost in my mind. The Washington Tempranillo which I mentioned to my rep was corked  and Sangiovese were interesting and his single vin Syrahs were the best. Again too expensive for my needs. I do believe the Vino  Sangiovese ros will find its way to my shelf. He also left very abruptly. just...walked out. It was a very odd tasting. ,wine,d0wo2nj,2,t5_2qhs8

About  of it was review for me Ive had a couple of wine courses previously so I knew how to taste wine and I worked at a couple of wineries when I was younger but I really enjoyed the class and learning the WSET approach. You do have to pass a short test if you want to go directly to Level . Friends in my class who have taken CMS courses did this. It involves a multiple choice test a short interview  and a wine tasting with the teacher. They all said it was pretty easy but again each of them holds a CMS level  and they all work in the industry.Good luck! I found a lot of useful info here I listen to the podcast regularly now.

What we do here is take a picture of a bottle pop the cork and then share our experience about the wine. You could tell us about the gift. Was it a birthday present? An engagement present? Have you been to this winery before? Hell Ive talked about drinking wine at a strip club before...you can pretty much tell us anything. Some people have an amazing senses and an amazing ability to describe what they smell and taste. Personally I can only pick out a few things here and there. Hell if I know what an underripe pineapple tastes like. Put your nose in the glass tell us what you smell if anything at all...not all wines will be aromatic though this one should have some yummy smells. Take a swig. Tells us what it tastes like...whether it tastes good...and bonus points if you paired some food with it and the wine complimented the meal.

They cant review a bottle thats faulty and you shouldnt take it as a condemnation of the wine since any wine could potentially develop a fault for reasons that have nothing to do with what went on in the winery.  Best you can do is look for other reviews of the same wine or see if you can find a way to try it before you pick up a bottle for yourself.  ,wine,d3knqdw,2,t5_2qhs8

One of those laws makes enotourism nearly impossiblethe wineries are not allowed to give tours or conduct tastings on their properties. The laws also forbid advertising for alcoholic beverages which includes advertising through personal online domain. This was what happened when I tried to load the website of a local winery when I was in Turkey. The website was not navigable beyond this point. When I asked my guesthouse owner to translate the Turkish writing he looked puzzled and said Our website is empty but the glasses will keep flowing.Now that Ive successfully obtained wine in Diyarbakir the unofficial capital of Kurdistan in Turkey I think Im ready to tackle wine travel in Lebanon this year.

He owns a French restaurant on the outskirts of Los Angeles and has an epic wine cellar so he went down there last night and dug these two beauties out for us to try.For two Cabernet Sauvignons by the same maker that are only a year apart these two wines had nothing in common except maybe some super dark stewed fruit notes. The  was a dull brick red in color and had amazing aromas of mancave intense leather tobacco savory stewed plums or strawberries. The tannins had so many years to ease up that they felt like silk across the palate and while the wine had body it wasnt intense or overwhelming... it was perfect.The  was darker in color and more purple than brick not a Malbec purple though obviously. I still got slight tobacco notes but they werent as pronounced as the stewed fruit and currant aromas. Like the  this wine was amazingly smooth on the palate with supple tannins but a more intense body.Of course Im sitting there marveling over the splendor of these two wines when I see my sister in law pour some ginger ale into her glass to mix it with the  because she needed some bubbles.

After that its been some sort of combination of make your own luck and right place right time.I would say that if you want to give it a shot start planning soon.  Identify a region and what wineries sound interesting.  Maybe even make a scouting trip if youre close by.  Most CA producers start hunting for interns in the spring so send resume and cover letters then.  Theyll also need to be the right kind of outfit to handle a rookie as a rule I prefer someone that has at least one harvest under their belt because I tend to ask a lot of my interns. Be ready to move to said region for a  months to complete the internship.  We also joke that wine work is  cleaning shit  moving shit and  drinking beer.

Mondays are half price wine night at a few restaurants so I decided to get some grub and drink some wine. I was craving some shortribs served with butternut squash gnocchi Parmesan smoked broccoli red wine sauce so I obviously had to go red. A server suggested a newer wine on the menu Dancing Hares Mad Hatter . On the eye Deep garnet and opaque in the middle and a bright maroon around the edges. Medium to medium minus viscosity. On the nose The wine was opened while I was having an appetizer so its been open for about...lets say a shade under an hour. Some red fruits oak alcohol. All the things that make young Napa cabs what they are. Slight hints of herbs. But its very light. The tongue and roof of the mouth Immediately unimpressed but its not bad. Somewhat flabby. Medium minus acidity. More red fruit. Probably strawberry. Tannins are...its not super tannic but theyre not quite fully integrated with everything. A little chocolate on the finish. The main event First off this restaurant has really dropped the ball. It used to be really tasty. I dont know what happened to it. The food is average at best. The pairing...acceptable. Its a bit strong and slightly overwhelms the beef. Only so slightly though. As much as I enjoyed coming here in the past I probably wont again. Conclusion Its not a bad wine. If you see it on sale or for a good price e.g. half price wine night go for it. Its tasty enough. Just dont get a bottle and break it out for your th anniversary. ,wine,daud7vt,1,t5_2qhs8

9921505,0,t1_db0g1c6,I started my adventures with red wine with Chianti and love it as much now as I did the first time.Maybe start with a malbec. Its a grape that was originally from France but is now the red grape of Argentina. It tends to be dry with a lot of fruit so has some nice flavors.Take notes on the wines you drink then try other grapes. For example if the Malbec seems too big try a Pinot Noir or Gamay they tend to be a bit lighter.Once you have figured out maybe  grapes that you enjoy I would suggest that you get to know each of those grapes. For example if you find that you like Pinot Noir go out and get yourself Pinots from different countries France California Chile invite some friends over and taste them side by side so you can see the differences from one country to another.  Then later...if you liked the French Pinots the best...go our and conduct the same experiment with French PN from different regions. Then rinse and repeat with  from the same region but different wineries. Wine for me is one of the great pleasures in life. They are so different and each bottle is a different experience.

10263454,0,t3_5mxyw1,Personally I would go with the Oreno. While Brunello offers excellent bang for the buck and  is a very good vintage there has been some question about BdMs ability for long term aging. Ive tried several  s s and even s that are already showing signs of hitting the back end of their life. Big names too. The Oreno should hold up for  years without question. That being said if youre looking to drink them sooner rather than later each has its own merits and would provide a very nice experience.,wine,dc7f2li,2,t5_2qhs8

But if youre on your way to Mosel you can fly into Paris and drive through Epernay just so you see it.If you only have  days stick to one of the French areas Bordeaux Left or Right bank dont do both or Borgogne.

You might transfer it into something like a carafe but you wouldnt decant it not a wide body low surface area for slow oxygenation.The key is to let them breathe and express themselves a bit.

10809312,0,t3_5uiddm,It took a little research but I think I finally came through. So as you say the whole appellation actually is DOCG. It was DOC until  but since this appellation was generically called Valpolicella DOC and it included Amarone Recioto Ripasso and Valpolicella it was wisely decided that each one of these wines deserved a more specific appellation thus creating one for each of these four wines a DOCG for Recioto and Amarone and a DOC for Ripasso and Valpolicella. Now why is it that some  Amarone are still DOC while others are DOCG? The new appellation was approved in March  and it established that each Amarone hitting the market from st January  would be labelled DOCG. Since the minimun ageing for Amarone is  years it may well be that some  Amarone were commercialized before the beginning of  hence with the old DOC label.source,wine,dduwk8h,6,t5_2qhs8

Like other commenters I think that NS winemakers need to embrace their terroir rather than trying to make wine that is trying to chase a specific market or compete with wines from warmerdifferent climates. I had NS wine a few years ago I think it was the Jost Marechal Foch? and it seemed like they were trying very hard to make a light red into an intense wine by amping up the acidity and tannins. Most wine consumers arent going to be willing to give you a second chance if they didnt like your product the first time and many people are unfortunately very willing to write off entire regions and grape varietals due to one experience. Youre never going to win over someone who only likes Napa Cabs but if you try to chase that consumer youre going to chase away the smaller group of people who might like the style that your region can excel at. ,wine,dgviedp,1,t5_2qhs8
