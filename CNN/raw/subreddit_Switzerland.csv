138078,1,t1_cetedje,Eh thats the essence of public infrastructure  it is subsidized to a massive degree to ensure a standard of quality and service across the entire nation. If SBBCFFFFS was forced to make every part of its services turn a profit as a private company might do a great deal of rural Switzerland would see its rail connections absolutely gutted. gtthey live from its monopolyCompetition would be a bad bad idea for the railway sector. Countries that already have competing railway companies suffer immensely from it  both the UK and the Netherlands have multiple companies operating stretches of rail and the consumer is only hurt by the fact they need to buy multiple tickets and transfer from trains of the one company to the other.Honestly Switzerland has a good thing going with its efficient and punctual rail service.

340547,0,t1_cff98q0,The only realistic reason for Switzerland to join the EU after this vote will be if European revengepressure becomes so unbearable as to cripple the economy and Switzerland has no choice.  The EU in its current form is fundamentally incompatible with popular democracy as the Irish Nice treaty and France EU Constitution already found out.  They voted against these only to find that the EU eventually snuck most of the provisions pas them anyway this time around without allowing votes.Weve already heard ominous rumblings about consequences and the moves on the energy market discussion Erasmus and scientific exchange mean the EU already had punishments up its sleeves in case of an affirmative outcome.  My prediction is that this will alienate Swiss voters who otherwise might have been more neutral hah about the idea of joining.  That said if the EU does this I can see it giving serious wind to all the antiEU populists in well everywhere.  Switzerland has exactly zero leverage in negotiations with its neighbors  but they still have to be careful to avoid doing stupid angry shit that risks having a negative impact.,Switzerland,cfg2g36,3,t5_2qhp6

1553661,0,t3_1xgbwt,Hi there swissimmigrantI know its quite a time since youve posted your text but anyway... cheer up. There are lots of people who recognize and appreciate the work all the foreigners do day by day. Just to let you know I have parents who migrated to CH and I got the swiss passport after I applied for it. Long time walking around with the CAusweis.I cant share all the points youve mentioned since the time before beeing a swiss I actually never had any negative experiences well of course from some douchebags of the lowclass right wing with shaved heads but even then brought them to tears with words and some cursing against their mothers dear god forgive me for that haha. I always felt like a swiss and was dealed with like a swiss. I really feel sorry that youve got feeling that you are not welcome. Thats not true. People like you like us are always welcome. Its only that you know... One stupid dumbass can ruin the name of a dozen good men. I spend a lot of time in countries around CH and must say that massimmigration of nonproductive people and those who are willing to apply for social help but on other hand refuse to get in just ruined some major cities and countrysides. I blame the politicians of those countries and cities who werent able to get a grip on this. People migrate for various reasons. Work hope of a better life family issues... but you know its just sad and frustrating when the wrong people start coming and taking advantage of all of us. Look at Paris for instance. Some wonderfull parts of the city now are completely in hand of foreigners and the sad thing is you actually feel like beeing somewhere else than in France. I just cant believe that the highly professionals like you are live in such areas. I guess if the initiative said against foreigners who come here take our social benefits demand for more rights and refuse to fit in instead of Gegen Masseneinwanderung the YES voters would have won with  there is always a Fehlerquote of . You understand what I want to say? This initiative was at that time the only way to express the fear of the swiss people.And just look at the campain of the Gegenkomitee. It was just crap. They always just started with the racismdiscussion and so on. It says against massimmigration not against immigration. At the end the pro commitee won because the contra just couldnt find a way to deal the the fear of the common people and to say look  well take care that we wont end up like other countries.Just some random thoughts. Keep it up hope youre still here.Hope this helps. Machs guet und liebe Gruessrf,Switzerland,cjb0wn5,2,t5_2qhp6

Approximately two hours will get you to Graubnden or into the beautiful Valleys of Lauterbrunnen or Kandersteg.. So I cannot tell you what you should visit or what is an absolute mustsee in Zurich but I can highly recommend the Swiss Pass.

The only thing the vote means that there will be a change to the constitution that is in some form very similar to what the initiative text said. As long as you start applying now and not in  years or so you should be fine.If you want to come to Switzerland to work you first have to find a job. When you get a job the employer will request a residency permit B for you. As a EU citizen you can come here for quite some time and look for a job but you will only get a L permit. The L permit has lots of disadvantages so housing bank account insurance etc. are really troublesome. With the B permit its all easy.I dont think we have preferential treatment of Swiss citizens as I think that would be a violation of the current immigration agreement we have with the EU. Since you speak German you shouldnt have too much trouble finding something in the German part as long as Swiss German isnt a requirement and the rest of your skills match the description.EDIT Check out other threads about this topic.

5350373,0,t1_cvvipow,Thanks!So Ive read this document but have some questions regarding your statements. Specifically it mentions that the most a Junior officer will ever serve consecutively is  days. Are you implying that most do not serve the time consecutively but instead break it up? If they do break it up how often are they serving and what is the duration? In regards to the future time which I have yes I do intend on trying to at least find some internships or another reason to live in Switzerland over my summer months. I appreciate your response!,Switzerland,cvvkj8q,1,t5_2qhp6

They were available in Boston and New York way before christmas. But nowhere to be found in Switzerland. He ordered one at an official Swatch retailer in St. Gallen but it never arrived there as well.Finally my mom wrote to their headquarters in february and then she finally got her christmas present admittedly with a nice apology letter and even an additonal watch.Still that sucked that you cant get a Swiss made watch in Switzerland...,Switzerland,cw37hm8,3,t5_2qhp6
5415718,0,t3_3p7u71,Well Ill answer those... One at a time. The Council of States like the American Senate is built to give all cantons an equal voice so all of them get  seats. However  cantons are historically considered halfcantons BaselStadt and BaselLandschaft Appenzell Inner and Ausserrhoden and Obwalden and Nidwalden. In the cases of Basel and Appenzell as the name shows it is because they used to be one canton in the case of Obwalden and Nidwalden collectively referred to as Unterwalden its because even by the standards of primitive cantons they were considered small. No though you may be put twice on a single list. This often serves for small parties to make up the numbers. Not really no. Your various lists will be apparentes no idea how to say that in English but they wont get any more votes together. In addition youll have to find  people from your party per list and I think theres also a deposit you have to pay though Im not sure. panacher means adding something on top of something else in French. Hence panache being the feather on top of the hat and by metonymy a word for bravado and a panach being what Germans call a Radler a halfbeer halflemonade drink. No idea sorry. Perhaps if you could dig up the equivalent word in French Id know. You could. But tallying officers will get suspicious if they see the same writing on numerous ballots. Recently Ricardo Lumengo who had been elected in Kanton Bern had his election invalidated and was fined because he was convicted of voting for around  people. You dont vote. Better luck next time! Yes. Theyd be subjected to severe penal punishment though. This is also a problem in small villages everyone knows everyone and so the tallying officers know everyones votes. Nope. Youd miss all the postal votes as well as all the people they make up a large majority of voters who put their votes in the ballot box in the two weeks before the election. Not really no. Since there are  votes a year parties do not have the kind of war chest their equivalents in other countries do. In addition nonpolitical influence groups dont tend to get involved in elections unlike in votations. This means election campaigns are usually relatively underfunded compared to votation campaigns. This is a typical leftwing talking point but its actually not that popular weirdly enough. Past attempts to make an initiative about it failed even to reach the required  signatures and it was proposed in one canton cant remember which and soundly defeated. There is a simultaneous translation service in the Federal Assembly. In practice French speakers usually speak French and all others speak German  Ticinese rarely speak Italian unless they want to make a specific point. In commissions where laws are created everything is done in German. Because very few people vote on election day. The ballot boxes are open for the two weeks before election day. People voting today are seen as being a bit of lastminute procrastinators  not really the image a party leader wants to project. There are two different types of alliance which I think you might be confusing here apparentement and parliamentary group. Apparentements are preelectoral alliances between lists that mean that these lists will be counted as a single block for the purposes of proportional voting. These can change between cantons typically the SVP and the FDP are apparented in some cantons but not in others. The parliamentary group is different it is a group inside the national parliament  so obviously it is decided nationwide. The main use of this is that places in commissions are allocated by parliamentary group. A parliamentary group must have a minimum of  deputies so if a party has less than that amount of deputies they will often join another partys group. Parliamentary alliances can be dissolved at any time. It echoes the mythical origin of Switzerland the Rtlischwur Rtli oath. In  Werner Stauffacher Arnold von Melchthal and the other guy I cant remember the name of are supposed to have sworn as representatives of Uri Schwyz and Unterwalden to create a perpetual alliance against the Habsburg domination. There are very few independent candidates because of the proportional system for the National Council. You have to be part of a list to be elected in a proportional system. So sometimes lists of independents are created in Vaud there is the Indpendants Vaudois which to my great despair arent Vaudois separatists and the Voter Blanc list but they hardly ever get any votes. In the Council of States or in Cantonal Governments or really anywhere the majority system is used independent candidates exist. The problem of course is that they dont have a party machinery behind them and dont really have much of a benefit of being outside the system since Switzerland is one of the countries in the world where politicians are most trusted. Theres nothing quite as organised as the English system. Of course if you keep voting against your partys position you might be in trouble but by and large Swiss parties are very lax on whips. The CVP and the FDP in particular have pretty massive variations between members of their party. As I said seats on committees are allocated by the weight of parliamentary groups. Inside the groups I dont know how it happens exactly but from what I understand senior politicians have priority to choose their committee and the newbies get the Stamp Standardisation committee or whatever. The nominees for Federal Councillor are always senior politicians from the party. So theyre usually members of the Council of States party presidents or members of cantonal governments. Of the current  Alain Berset was a member of the Council of States for Fribourg Simonetta Sommaruga was a member of the Council of States for Bern Doris Leuthard was president of the CVP Eveline WidmerSchlumpf was a member of the cantonal government of Grisons Johan SchneiderAmmann was a member of the National Council for Bern though he was widely considered the inferior candidate to Karin KellerSuter who was in Sankt Gallens cantonal government Didier Burkhalter was a member of the Coucil of States for Neuchtel and Ueli Maurer was the president of the SVP. As you can see many of them were MPs. If a member of the National Council is elected to the Federal Council the most popular nonelected member of his list or family of lists gets elected in his stead same if a same person is elected both to the National Council and the Council of States or if a member of the National Council resigns or dies. If a member of the council of states resigns dies or is elected to higher office a byelection happens.And the others have already been answered by uLejeuneDirichlet. this can be a problem at times. I remember an FDP national councillor in Vaud wanted to retire but the next most popular in his apparentement was a SVP member so he had to wait until the next election to go.,Switzerland,cw3x0hx,10,t5_2qhp6

In my Idea of an anarchist system anarchocommunism a large part of the crime we have would simply not be a crime another part would fall away because of a lack of poverty. what happens with the rest is up to the community said individual lives in but trial should be held in a way that was previously agreed upon by the largest possible mayority. The punishment is then decided upon directly democratic and should be at best involving the least ammount of violence possible.Well if no one works nothing works right? Turns out that many studies have found out that working for a boss is actually really inefficient as hierarchy makes you less motivated. If you and some willing members of your community alone or together start a cooperative where you all decide on the general direction of the cooperative and then Work autonomously like the WOZ newspaper. it is a very satisfying way of accomplishing work.Also anarchy doesnt bring totalitarianism as it abolishes hierarchy,Switzerland,d0kt5u1,1,t5_2qhp6

This way you effectively spread the power as well as make it more efficient.As much as I like it the main issue I see with a fast turn around would be that policies and laws take time to get an effect. We humans tend to see on a really short term which would not be beneficial. I like the idea to let people work for a few years  so that they can actually get something done. Else we waste a lot of time passing folders and explaining to the new guy what is going on etc...Im not really worried about how youre gonna pay the RBI on the long run. If we are strongly independent we have the possibility to print money for ourselves. It will devaluate our money and vacation outside the country and import prices would go through the roof though!!Maybe a system where you actually index your total money to the total people living in the country would counter that. Im not an expert on that issue but money increasing indefinitely seems like an issue on the long term.The economic system as it is today is doomed to fail closed system limited resources with an unlimited growth is mathematically impossible depending on it to survive is a dead end hence my point N .

10532718,1,t1_dd1yhcj,That bullshit about our wages being higher thus meaning that we have higher prices would be logical if you didnt know the profit margins that are behind those types of products.I used to work in a company that would sells spare parts to a type of culinary appliance machine. The margins that we had on those parts were fucking outrageous if the costumer ended up knowing how much we actually pay for the parts that we sold.Im talking about  price increase in certain parts compared to the procurement price plus all costs associated with assembling storing and selling the parts. Why are the prices like this? Because the customer pays for these prices and can afford them.Thats basically it.,Switzerland,dd2009t,1,t5_2qhp6

And then of course the old lady who takes out her pension in cash each month and then proceeds to the store to pay with a  CHF bill. Jesus christ its nice that Switzerland is so safe but seriously. At the very least larger payments should be made by card. Not to mention that many credit cards have additional theft insurance and warranties if you pay with them.,Switzerland,dgrie6q,3,t5_2qhp6

Then x years later they come back again. This back and fourth seems to be the opposite of any progress and at least in Switzerland I think we can talk about progress even if its slow.That said it probably has to do with the concordance system and not exactly with the speed so maybe we can have the best of both worlds...,Switzerland,dgtma86,3,t5_2qhp6
