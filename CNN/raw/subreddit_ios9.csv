6263022,0,t3_41dawy,try recording a front facing video from your camera app. If the same thing happens you may have a bad microphone. There are  microphones on the iphone. One on the back for video taking with the rear camera. One on the bottom for phone calls. And one on the front inside the ear piece for Siri and front camera usage. My front mic went bad but it would record terrible sounds instead. you can also test the front mic by creating a sound recording in the texting application.,ios9,cz1jaz5,1,t5_2v31n

Ive searched all over for answers or similar experiences but all I find are praises for this wonderfull app. Its just really frustrating. I keep typing messages and she keeps copypasting them back to me with half of my message mixed with half of some old one. And we both cleared our saved messages and I tried reinstalling the app and clearing any saved data in the cloud and on the phone but it still mix my new texts with old ones it shouldnt even know about except maybe if they save all my texts in the cloud?I even called my phone company to have them look into if something was wrong but they say eveything is fine. And the is no problems with the default iOS keyboard. I went back to using default for a few weeks and it never did it. I enabled Swiftkey again last night and it did it again on the very first message I wrote.,ios9,d1tmz3t,1,t5_2v31n
