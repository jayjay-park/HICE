Pick up and sell armor and cheap swords that velen longsword is like  crowns just laying there. Hope that helps.,thewitcher3,cszcd1d,1,t5_2w93y

5842671,0,t1_cxkd4gw,Amen. My thoughts exactly. They went closer to action gameplay than rpg and that worries me. I hope elder scrolls returns to its roots. No voice in main character and branching and interesting dialog,thewitcher3,cxli14x,1,t5_2w93y

6819054,0,t1_d0edsot,You will die on that difficulty if you dont dodge well. Learn to do that for the different enemies and your battles will take longer but you wont die I read that playing on the highest two difficulties is sort of better because of how they force you to learn to dodge and dodging around and sort of tactically outsmarting your opponents really makes Geralt feel like a badass. I feel like I can take on really strong enemies sometimes because Ill be able to dodge their attacks so I can hack on them until they finally die.On the other hand it can get old to sort of have to learn most new enemies and die to them until you do so I think its best to adjust the difficulty while youre playing if  you think its too hard  easy ,thewitcher3,d0p8lei,2,t5_2w93y

7745740,0,t3_4ldayv,I got that GPU. With the same graphical settings as the PS at least as close as possible I get drops below fps in Novigrad which is the big town while at p. Pretty much anywhere else I get above fps. So GPU side you will NOT be playing on low setting at all. The framerate drops seem to be caused mostly by a CPU bottleneck though. GB of RAM is more than enough for this game btw.Now the PS version also dips below fps at some points. Watch this analysis by Digital Foundry  Though that video was uploaded a year ago so I dont know if patches have improved the performance on the PS. I can tell you patches havent provided a significant performance improvement on the PC version in my experience.I would say go with the PC version if youre interested in modding otherwise just pickup the PS version.,thewitcher3,d3mmukn,1,t5_2w93y

7801240,0,t3_4ltmdu,I have a fix for this and you can still use your mods.You dont have to install this mod but in the downloads section the optional files contain the fixed scripts for this update.

7870714,0,t1_d3vxorx,Dont waste too much money on food you can loot  of the food youll ever need. Make sure you use swallow to full effect.

8095779,0,t1_d4p0l4q,Try using potions oils bombs and signs in combat. Check the bestiarity for enemy weaknesses and use your dodge a lot to help in combat. You can generally get in  hits before youll need to parry block or dodge an attack from an enemy and dodging is the easiest. For the quests just try and do the in order of recommended level. You can let them all stack up in your quest log so dont worry about doing a side quest thats  leveled higher than you right now. ,thewitcher3,d4q1e9e,1,t5_2w93y
8172911,0,t3_4r8m8g, They fit perfectly.  You get quests  which are more detailed than the ones already ingame. New armorsnot op and alternative looks for  side characters.  You can turn these looks onoff however you likecheck settings  expansions can come after the game is finished  however if I had to say  I would finish hearts of stone b the last main quest it was made to fit that part or so did i hear on the internet. Even if you had the expansion hos it makes main world even bigger without loading times you wouldnt venture there much since that area is filled with high lvl enemies. Blood and wine is imo a great DLC to play after you finish the game  but thats just my opinion. I think it fixes some of the dialog choices from TW. Im still playing w so I didn t chose that option. Hope this helps,thewitcher3,d4z5w98,2,t5_2w93y
