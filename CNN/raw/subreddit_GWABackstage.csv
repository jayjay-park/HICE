Its human nature to want to belong so it can be hard to be told youre different even when its intended to convey acceptance. If youre used to trying to conceal your accent in meatspace then comments here will feel more harsh than they are intended to be. Hopefully a little more conversation like this and a note on your audios will at least keep the regulars from fixating on your accent and get you the comments you want to hear. ,GWABackstage,covmftq,1,t5_33puo

3751485,0,t1_cqjvlec,We dont have all the physical hangups and the like online like we do in person.  Then we tend to not recognize that things are real when online so were much more open than IRL.  IRL has risks and costs which tends to make us much more guarded about certain things especially if it opens us up to rejection.  I wonder sometimes how many women were so into me and yet I didnt notice or if I would have said something indicating interest how she would respond.  Im sure it works that way for women too.  Like listening on GWA I hear a woman talk about lacking help or some such thing and I have to wonder how do you not have guys lining up? after listening to her.  Im sure Ive had women thinking the same thing of me in the past.  Life is funny that way.Edit I guess things would be a lot easier in life if we would be more open to expressing our desires less selfish and less averse to rejection but I sure dont know how to make that happen.,GWABackstage,cqjw8tr,2,t5_33puo

When I first saw Mr. Nobyls username appearing in the audio communities I really thought a moment or two that he might be Ukrainian lol. Now the sound in this episode was really awful at the beginning and I hesitated for a moment if I should continue ... and yes it really was worth to do so. I was wondering how quick I was get used to it or it was a lot better throughout the podcast and I enjoyed listening to this one as well as the earlier episodes. I liked the discussions about food and pasta sauce preparations that was kinda extra funny. I would listen no matter what kind of a guest you have ... sounds strange but I like your laughs and giggles so much and I enjoy listening to you asking your questions.

6202381,0,t3_40jjq1,I think the reason people dont want exposure is because the more exposure that comes to GWA the more opportunity there is to be discovered. By either their peers in school at work some people have spousespartners that dont know about GWA. GWA has grown immensely even in the year and half that I have been around. If MTV did something on us it would be detrimental. The numbers would sky rocket. When playboy did an article on us some people were worried but this would be much bigger and reach a wider number of people. I didnt even know about this so its news to me but those are some of the reasons I could think of for not wanting GWA to become publicly recognized. ,GWABackstage,cyun7r7,9,t5_33puo

6638122,0,t3_46jkj8,CheatingLittle backstory. Dad cheated on mom leading to their divorce. Sister is currently going through one because of the same. My LDR and Ive both been cheated on Hers was her last Boyfriend so theres some experience on feeling the pain of being that person. On the other hand neither one of us have been on the other side of the fence Being the cheater. We had gotten to know each other sexually Phone Sex for a while before I suggested it as an idea. She seemed to like the concept but was hesitant so once we talked about it for a bit I left it alone. A few days later she told me she had been thinking about it and after some discussion we tried it out. For her she gets to have all of that power by being the other girl in control of someone elses boy and I get my submissive needs fulfilled by having that control taken from me. We tend to get really into it and have a safeword because we both know what were doing could trigger some painful memories. Honestly though for me its more of an emotional release but with that release comes a drop. Theres a lot of guilty feelings that arise once the body tingling stops and with that a ton of pillow talk. Our overall conversations can get up to the . hour mark. At the end of the day if someone I knew found out about it Id be willing to answer some questions but Im not going out of my way to defend what gets me off. Unless my LDR and I mutually invite someone into our world what gets us off is our own damn business. If someone I know really wants to make an issue of it bye felicia ,GWABackstage,d05xsug,3,t5_33puo

7400371,0,t3_4goqj9,I think people should have some kind of warning or tag if theyre using it since some people dont like hearing it and it ruins things for them but I love it. I guess its because its degrading and rude but sexual and I like that in recordings. The other words like bitchwhore dont seem to be used as much so I feel like they have more and I like that even more. But yeah I think it could be used that way like an endearing sort of way or possessive in a sexual context but it depends on the person.

7401012,0,t3_4goqj9,Name calling for me is only really effective if its used sparingly. Im talking like... Once or twice in a scene. The less often its used the more impact it has.

When Im listening to an audio where Im being called a slut or bitch or whore every other sentence the surprise element is gone and it feels more like degradation and I stop listening.

7882544,0,t3_4n72m0,I know its technically very early Thursday but I hope you dont mind me having a go.What would you say is the most difficult part about making audio porn? Do you have a favorite part?At the moment my living situation is the toughest part. Not that Im embarassed so much as my housemates and I all work very differing schedules so I try to be respectful of noise levels when I dont have the house to myself.Having said that I have made audio just for my partners in the past and I think the most fun part about that is the anticipation. They know its just for them I never know precisely when theyll hear it... I like the little thrill in that regard.If you could have the answer to any question that you wanted to know what would you ask? Do you think there would be a downfall to knowing the answer?I think Id like to know the guaranteed exact date and time of my death really. Sounds morbid but if I know I wont actually die before that point... I think it would give me a better sense of free license to do as I will you know?Do you have any weird or nervous habits?I used to bite my nails though I havent done that in years. I tend to give myself haircuts when Im going through phases of heavy stress if that counts. It actually turns out fine.You can now only hear one song any time that music is played which song do you choose to hear?In that case silence. I know how grating it can get to even hear your favorite song too many times in a row.Give us a fun fact or a few about you!  what dont we know!Im doublejointed in the shoulders.What is your guilty pleasure?Does my stash of Mercedes Lackey novels count? Im going to go with yes.If you could be born again would you choose to be a different sex than what you are? Why or why not?Well theres a muddy question. If we want to go with the fact that Im legally considered female and have a vagina yes.Considering that I identify as male already though Im going to go with Id really rather just have easier access to hormone therapy and surgery.Do you have any weird food combinations that you like? ex pudding and hot chipsI cant eat ice cream without having a warmhot beverage to sip at which Im told defeats the purpose  I just dont like brain freeze frankly.Lets say you have a kinkfetish that could possibly be a deal breaker for your partner. Do you tell your partner? If yes how would you go about it. If no why not?It depends on the person and the kink and how invested I am in the relationship.Im careful about how I bring up some of the touchier things just because I dont want anyone to ever feel uncomfortable but I also tend to reassure people that it absolutely wont hurt my feelings if they have no interest in indulging it  so long as they arent rude to me about it you know?Having said that I tend to try and get a feel for where a person stands before I even bring it up in a personal regard but I also tend to be fairly upfront in a very general way about the fact that I have some potentially unusual habit in bed.Imagine that you are in a partnership and you would like to like to change the level of sexual exclusivity of your relationship going from one of monogamy polygamy open swinging etc. to a different type. How would you bring this up to your partner?That one is I think extremely situational?Speaking from my own experience I tend to bring up fairly early in the proceedings in a respectful way that I am not a monogamous person and that it would be unreasonable to expect that from me resolutely.I mean to say that I personally think it would be unfair of me to get involved with someone and have them expect monogamy out of me. Not that its unreasonable overall and if thats what theyre looking for Im sure that persons out there you know?Trying to open relationships up that didnt start that way... is a weird process! Lots of calm levelheaded discussion needs to go on. I find it helps to extensively plan what youre going to say if youre the one bringing it up and be prepared to answer a lot of questions potentially equally respectful or not. Be prepared to reassure the person youre already with that they still matter are still important and that that relationship is still a priority for you.And yeah I think you have to keep in mind that ongoing communication is KEY. Being able to be open about your emotions in those situations is kind of super important. Mutual trust and respect is super important. Not damaging that trust is super important. But also be prepared for the fact that its a major dealbreaker to some people and that if youre bringing it up out of the blue and they dont take well to the suggestion you may potentially be ending your relationship in fairly short order. I know the last point is not reassuring but I would encourage people thinking of trying that to keep it in mind.,GWABackstage,d422kmn,3,t5_33puo

Or comment that Im excited to listen later and then follow up when I do. And if youre posting...tell a couple peeps have them kick the comments off. I have definitely asked friends to pop the comment cherry on posts that are way upvoted but weirdly devoid of comments do you people not wanna admit liking pet play? Because its fine. Its hot..

It was interesting it was a female narrator describing the situation and specific details about the girl in the scene but nothing about the guy.

It would be incredibly discouraging because I would want my efforts to be recognized. I would kind of want me to be recognized as I see myself.... And yet I know that in the real world particularly the semireal world of Reddit  where things are hard to keep track of and uniqueness is literally hard to see  its not like that. You have to build up your connections and fanbase were I ever to have one gradually. And I think I would try and get as much feedback as possible and make little coursecorrections in how and what I record.Anyway for what its worth dont be discouraged  these things seem to take time  advice I would offer you and OP as well.Edit added an in,GWABackstage,d4j0deu,1,t5_33puo

Just look at my most recent albeit a very extreme audio it looks like this points  upvoted votesDoes it suck having my audio downvoted? Some might think so but in the end I really dont give two shits. The voting system in particular the downvoting is used by people who are not a real part of this community.

I know that I wont ever get as many as some of the really talented performers who have been at it for a while and who have high production value.  Accepting those things as realities helps me manage my own expectations of how many upvotes or comments I feel like I should get.One thing I have noticed with my handful of recordings is that the dirtier a recording is the better it does.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was my first recording submission too.It will take longer to see if the level of filthiness really does matter or if it was just an outlier.At this point I am just happy to get any feedback and comments because it helps me improve and can help guide me towards what kind of content to upload next.,GWABackstage,d5etgg6,3,t5_33puo

Plus gosh the gravel in ur voice lt ...It can be very captivating to hear folks discuss things they enjoy.  Plus Im a bit of a science nerdette and while I havent heard many around here I do enjoy science rambles this being no exception.I like how u chuckle about certain things like u might even blush during research or something  Such a romance in the MRI room haha. Drawing straws and snappy phrases indeed. The SOs will tell u which are good subjects hmm. I would tend to agree about the part of Pfizer attempting to market to the other half.  Also I found it interesting that the control image was a shuttle launch especially since thats the go to sitcom sex image rt? couple go behind closed door cut to rocket launch or nuke exploding.A lot of this made sense knowing my own body but didnt realize there were scientists proving these things out there.  Of course theres a female equivalent to getting hard and getting head .  and only th is exposed?! Interesting.Im curious now are there studies of the effectiveness of the Aural vs VES? on women?  Again didnt realize there was science backing it but totally understand the mental piece of female arousal.  Ive def lost some steam with quiet partners as my mind got in the way.  I would just hypothesize that women in general are more audiophile than men although who knows if theyd identify as such.  Im just reflecting on why GWA is such a better stimulus for me than most vid porn because you find a great voice and a scene and you fill in the rest to suit your exact tastes and provide the physical stimulation to your tastes as well.  Plus I understand enough about female arousal that its too evident in a lot of vid porn that the girl is not  bit aroused and that bothers me too much to enjoy it.

9304422,0,t3_57vrr1,Sorry to hear youre having such problems man but I think youre being a bit hard on yourself. The oral equivalent of writers block is a pain in the butt but its not something that should trigger a whole guilt spiral. Especially feeling guilty about now listening to everything on your saved list before proceeding with new stuff thatll just drive you crazy. Theres never going to be a halt to the deluge of amazing content here Aphrodite willing no one listener could ever give everyone their due but the people you do listen to and comment on? Im pretty sure they all give many many shits about your comments.I can relate to some of your issuesquestions even though I dont record as yet. Ive gotten into a regular routine of writing any night when I have the time which is sadly quite rarely. I have a set cup that I drink out of I listen to some of my recentlysaved GWA stuff and I can easily go until am if I let myself. Which is great except now I just cant get the juices flowing when writing at any other time. Daylights killing my creativity.That might be half a potential solution for you though. A really regular routine is superhelpful at quashing writersrecorders block but you become helpless outside of it.,GWABackstage,d8veif5,2,t5_33puo
9304733,0,t1_d8vfc9x,Yeah Im a fast typist. I dont tend to say that much unless I have something to say and these kinds of topics are important to me. Sorry for the wall of text though. I know what you mean and I was the same way. The positive feedback keeps the critical voice at bay but its only temporary. Especially if you havent recorded for a little while all those critical thoughts start piling up.  Mine lessened when I started antidepressants but also when I made things more in line with my values. I stopped trying to make things I thought would be popular and made things that felt personally important to me audios that might help people or make them feel good audios for more specific audiences audios with different aims or intentions. It helped me a lot to feel more motivated and my success criteria shifted from something an arbitrary number of people liked to something I felt personally proud of and that might get some nice heartfelt comments on the side. Its tough to listen to your own work especially if your brain is hyperanalysing everything for flaws but Ive found that even though the process is exhausting and unpleasant once Ive finished I can listen back to it and feel proud of it knowing that its good and that people will probably like it. I still dont enjoy listening to it personally but theres a kind of empathetic enjoyment a sort of thirdperson view of it maybe. Mostly its just knowing that Ive made something that feels good to me feels fulfilling. Come what may even if it doesnt get a lot of comments I think Ive done a good job made a good effort and tried to make something a bit different. That feels good to me. Im worrying less about what other people will think and whether theyll judge me Im making stuff according to what I think is important and valuable even if its for other people to listen to thats more of a focus on my own fulfilment. I think it might be good to try and do the same.,GWABackstage,d8vfxff,3,t5_33puo

I dont think I have any appealing features but I do what I can in the gym to keep myself healthy. The first thing I notice in a person is their body. A feature that I like the most about myself are my broad shoulders. I like someone who is geekynerdydorky is funny in either an accidentalsarcasticquirky kind of way and mostly someone who is passionatedriven in whatever it is they do. If that person also happens to be an amazing cook I will compliment them all the way to the moon.I dont speak like anyone but I can do celebrity impersonations I dont look like anyone but as a kid I often did the peoples eyebrow so I got associated with the Rock.A lot of people wouldnt normally guess that Im an artist or that I like to draw. I usually keep this on the downlo unless Im asked about it. That and I really enjoy reading comic books and graphic novels.My favorite thing about November is that its my birthday month.Here I just met you and this is crazy so lets get chatty! When youve got the time maybe? Six drinks. I danced like no one was watching I had fun chatting with an Aussie and a Brazilian about traveling and got bearhugged by a very tall guy who I tried giving the highest highfive to. I even belted out to a JT song because who doesnt?  I am always the worst at answering this kind of question but if I do leave a legacy its that I was a good friendbrotheretc to those in my company and that I motivatedinspired kids who asked me about art and went out to seek  their dreams and follow on them like its their lifeblood.

Its really refreshing to be around people who can be comfortable about their sexuality. My first script was I can be whatever you want  by uSuperHappyDeathSquad . I chose it because it took me through various personality types and kinks.   Im very glad that I chose it since I would never have guessed that fdom would be my preferred script type.

10249433,0,t1_dc5k2hz,starts humming my freeze ray from Dr. Horriblehuh? oh yeah that does sound like a fanastic premise for an audio. Now Im just thinking of all the ways to shift the setting of an audio somewhere else. I have never really thought to much about it but its true setting the stage for an audio could be as simple as referencing a well known event. I think one of my favourite cases of this was in Anne of Green Gables one of the later books in the series has a character say something like they say some archduke got shot in europe and theres a war starting I hope our boys dont get sent over there Bam time set. as for fantasy things that can make it easier or harder. If I were to matter of factly say something like Hey try not to use so much water the water recycling system is acting up and the clean water tanks are starting to get low. I think it has something to do with that solar flare that we saw last week Im sure it must have fried something somewhere on the station. BOOM were on a space station. Why? I dunno maybe well talk about maybe we wont. are there more people? who knows. I need to add this to my list D,GWABackstage,dc5tvow,2,t5_33puo

As you have just said that mismatched dishes and cups can also go together as they can look so pleasing. I guess you could say that about most interior design in terms of furniture colour schemes and themes in general. I think minimalist is my favourite style of interior design what about yourself?Oh. Do ramble on I really enjoy interior design and rambles. gt I feel you on the puns. I love puns! Double entendres and puns should have cute little babies because we would totally be the outcome.

10942498,0,t3_5wah2t,I agree! Especially for girls who tend to get LOTS of false information even in the digital age. Some researchers say more so than in the past because of the complexities of weeding fact from alternative fact on the Internet.In my opinion I think the well wishes stem from the fact that most children spend the better part of their lives seeking their parents approval. If I had to guess Id say thats what this dad was tapping into many girls feel a very real need to to have a fathers approval. We even have a name for it a daddy complex. Twisted as this may be by telling his daughter that its what he wants her to do he frees her from that guilt to live up to expectations. Now living up to the parents expectations means fulfilling your own desires and not feeling guilty about it.We all know that sex is shamed for girls. One of the more popular lessons we learn Boys fuck sluts but marry virgins. We are also taught that we are not complete without a man so marriage is still very much the heteronormative goal so to speak. So if you fuck youre an actual slut and if you dont fuck but want to fuck youre a metaphorical slut. Many girls navigate some or all! of their lives entangled in this warped shameinducing conundrum...Dont think that my urgency on this matter has anything whatsoever to do with maybe possibly having struggled with this for some or most of my life...just sayin  .,GWABackstage,de8n3q5,3,t5_33puo

Therefore your consequences will be mostly social. As I wrote below tides may yet turn as people realize what this nosy bitch did to you. As they start to think about whether they would want her spreading their own secrets around. You have a chance now I would even consider it a gift to live an authentic life. Own it as Samuel said. Stand up with your head high and say Hell yeah I like sex so what...you dont??         ampnbsp         On the other hand I dont live an authentic life. I have this GWA secret and many more. Im basically  secret. Sometimes thats fun but other times I wish I could just be myself. You have a chance to do that now  with consequences  but not the most serious type of them.         ampnbsp       For example I would get fired. I would lose my livelihood and my career all the  that went into decades of education.

10990731,0,t3_5wt7xn,Im certainly late to the discussion here but I wanted to join on what other people have touched on already which is your health. I will keep this brief but your mental being is ultimately what will suffer the most in this period take care that you keep people around that are going to be supportive and know this isnt the time to rib on you for it inappropriately. I could write a novella on my experiences with bullying but this isnt about me nor the place. Its worth always remembering that this is beyond a shitty thing to do its flat out betrayal and a betrayal of those you thought you could trust. Depression sadness hate panic anxiety those are all normal feelings to have right now. Be aware of them and let yourself have those feelings. Friends in your immediate life and your friends on Backstage are supporting you regardless just dont let those negative feelings start to feel like the new normal. So whether you choose to own it or delete your account and start over theres ultimately no right answer. All we can do is offer the best advice each of us individually know how and hope it resonates with you in some way. Listen to your brain and trust your support please dont drown yourself in the negativity of others when you have the life raft at your side.Be well friend. ,GWABackstage,dedrjaq,2,t5_33puo

Mix water salt and sugar until dissolved to make brine add crushed garlic and chicken cover and refrigerate for at least  hour. Preferably overnight. . Put your oil in a  quart Dutch oven or other heavy bottom pot no more than halfway full but enough the cover your chicken. Start heating your oil you want it between F and F but get it to F to start. . Crack eggs into small bowl and whisk lightly until mixed. Combine dry ingredients for crust in large bowl. Take chicken out of brine pat the chicken as dry as possible. Dip chicken in flour mixture and cover the piece you are working with then dip it in the egg mixture then back in the flour mixture ensuring with every step that you allow all the excess flouregg to fall off. In small batches add your coated chicken to the frying oil once it has reached F. Make sure to keep the temperature of the oil between F and F. Allow the chicken to cook until it at least reaches F internal for dark meat or F for white meat you can keep it in there longer if you want a darker crust. . Take out your chicken and allow it to cool on a wire baking rack NOT PAPER TOWELS until cool enough to eat. . Enjoy your fried chicken afterglow. ,GWABackstage,dephxpf,5,t5_33puo

11643659,0,t3_664za3,Yourself . Do you have a particular style you stick to or do you mix it up depending on occasion?I feel like my preferred style is like this girl the most part is conservative feminine vintage I love s looks. always been like that but more recently Ive started embracing heelswedges. . Do you have specific workhome attire? Do you dress differently on weekendsnights out? How often do you dress formally and how much effort do you put into it? Work is almost always cardigan skirt tights heels.  its my more professional look but I try to inject fun colors. At home is just leggings and a top with flats Very low key and comfortable.  . Would you consider yourself low or high maintenance? Do you have accessories that go with your outfits? Are you a MUA? Do you do your own hair nails etc. or go to a professional? I do everything myself makeup nails etc aside from my hair. Im not a MUA I cant contour for the life of me. I think Im pretty low maintenance. In the morning it takes me a half hour to dress makeup hair. To me thats fairly reasonable.  . How much of what you do to make yourself presentable do you feel you are doing for yourself and others it can vary depending on the different scenarios above?I am doing it  for me. I am excessively vain haha. All SOs Ive had go you dont need makeup. No I dont need makeup. I enjoy it as an art form.  I love doing smoky eye and red lips while I wear lingerie I love a natural look during the week I love a winged liner when out with friends. But Im always doing it for my own vain self.  . Do you dress differently for sexual things solo or with others? What types of clothing makes your feel sexiest? I dress much more revealing for sexy things. Tight dresses and heels paired with lipstick make me feel sexiest. Others . What types of outfits do you find sexiest on a SO?Men who know how to Wear a suit and tie. . What types of outfits do you find yourself fantasizing about most?  of the time it is this This is my pure kryptonite.  . What is the least appealing outfit someone you like could wear? What would be an automatic turnoff?Honestly I cannot handle men who dress like slobs stains rips etc. It just communicates a real lack of self care.  . Would you prefer certain outfits stay on during intercourse or would you want to take them off of your partner or have your partner take yours off of you?I always think lingerie is a waste when my partner just rips it right off me. I wish I could keep certain pieces on. I also think frantic clothed sex urgency is very hot. I dont like undressing my partner aside from undoing buttons.  . Would seeing someone you dont have sexual desire for family close friend etc. in an outfit that you find sexy make you feel weird or does your mind just filter it out?My mind filters it. When I see strangers I think its hot. When I see family members it doesnt even register. Thankfully.     ,GWABackstage,dgftm6u,6,t5_33puo

11647417,0,t1_dgfqymp,gt I am trying to redo my wardrobe considerably so Ive taken more chances on some articles of clothing.Thats what Ive been doing lately except for the taking chances part maybe. Ive been sticking to muted colors and flannels trying out different jackets and accessories. Fitted clothing definitely goes a long way toward making someone look better. Looking back at the years of baggy clothes in pictures just makes me sad. But at least I was comfortable.gt this will pull in a lot of hate I would guess is oversized sweatshirtssweatpantsAs long as its not a consistent thing Id agree. But if someone is just at home and wants to be comfortable I dont have a problem with it. If theyre wearing it during sex as long as it was spontaneous or a quickie or something I wouldnt mind. But I could see how itd be upsetting if that was all that was ever worn.,GWABackstage,dgg8yot,2,t5_33puo
