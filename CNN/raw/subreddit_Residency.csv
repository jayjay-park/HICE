3506711,0,t3_3086yi,I think  is fine for FP even as an IMG.  I would focus a wide net on ruralcommunity based FP programs where you have a good chance of matching.  The reality is you need to lower your selection criteria and be willing to make sacrifices in your lifestyle for a short period of time.  I would do well or pass step  as soon as possible because this gives you a leg up on other IMGs who have not passed it.,Residency,cprznfw,1,t5_2t8qv

7210995,0,t3_4c1coa,Im in the same boat medicine prelim and radiology and theyre right. Only the rarest of fellowships care one lick about your step  exam. Ive talked to residents all over the place including ucsf vandy WVU etc and everyone Ive talked to matched in the fellowship they wanted regardless of their actual Step  score  a pass is all thats required. Your LOR from residency matter waaaaaaaaaay more so be a good resident. ,Residency,d1xu14v,1,t5_2t8qv
7232734,0,t1_d1tdt8x,gt File taxes use it as evidence of zero income get zero required payment outside the grace period. Bonus more months count toward loan forgiveness. Consolidating non federal loans into a direct federal loan will make them qualify for federal loan repayment plans Just met with a financial aid counselor from my institution today and we discussed this at length. It is a legitimate and commonly used strategy. Seems like a good way to go especially if you plan on staying in academic medicine and executing the PSLF after  years.,Residency,d20b4qv,1,t5_2t8qv
7410861,0,t3_4grz9w,If you are part of an organization its worth checking on their rules.  Your regulatory body may also have guidelines.I have worked in family medicine clinics that worked with low income and refugee populations and they at one point bought a piece of furniture that a patient really needed and then pretended it had been donated to the clinic.  That was how they handled it.  But my understanding was that that was very unusual for them and that they had all discussed it together and worked through the ethics carefully.  Talking about these things with colleagues is very important.I think that you would need to reflect on your reasons for doing this and how it would affect the physicianpatient relationship.  This could be a very individual answer depending on you and depending on the patient.  Different patients would perceive such a gesture in different ways  some may find it intrusive or frightening some might be grateful for some it might lead to boundary confusion.  Be aware that not all patients would appreciate or want such a gesture and it could backfire on you.  Would it change the expectations that either of you has of the other?  When you say gifts would this become an ongoing practice between you and this patient?  As the patient they may wonder what they are expected to do for you in return or may come to have expectations that you cant meet.As someone in psychiatry I would of course also consider what it might mean to the patient to receive a personal item of mine that I had presumably worn or spent a lot of time with.  That could be very intrusive in the context of psychotherapy and I would be extremely careful about the meaning of that to them and to me.At the end of it you think about boundary crossings and boundary violations.  We are all human and at times we may give and receive gifts touch our patients disclose certain things about ourselves.  Some things are absolutely always wrong anything sexual anything violent etc. but there are many shades of grey.  I would not say that it is  wrong  of the time to give a homeless patient a jacket.But I would wonder about  why that patient at that time?  How will both people perceive it and how will it change the physicianpatient relationship?  Will those changes be positive more trust or negative unclear boundaries unrealistic expectations?,Residency,d2kke6s,7,t5_2t8qv

7971664,0,t3_4oegqv,Its possible...she would need to be up front with her PD and ask if she can seek out other opportunities before ever talking to anyone else. Then she needs to keep in contact with NorCal PDs and let them know she is looking to move back. She could also ask for permission to reapply through the match to R spots of multiple specialties including IM. All in all I think it is unlikely she will find a spot back in NorCal given how competitive it is to match there for any specialty. You need to start looking for jobs in NOLAyesterday.,Residency,d4c39hz,1,t5_2t8qv
8082802,0,t3_4pvjpm,You may get a few years into your practice get completely burned out and have zero options.  Yeah working at a hospital or academic job may not be what you want now but can you really be  sure that it wont ever appeal to you? Finishing residency will allow you the option of changing.  It will also allow you the option of doing a fellowship later on if you decide that there is one area in particular that you want to focus on.,Residency,d4okxts,9,t5_2t8qv

8491695,0,t1_d62x4y4,That is an interesting story. I talked about unions briefly at a formal resident get together but there were not many people and the feeling I got was that people were too apathetic to start something. I feel like our institution is either not bad enough or people are rightfully worried about any possible repercussions. Maybe we will be able to bring it up again.
