5806545,0,t3_3up1p0,I had the same idea just different way of mounting it. I have a TJ and the same principal could be used for a JK. I was going to create a giant U shaped mount that would bot in the existing tire carrier bolt holes and the two ends would be come around the spare tire. the wires could be ran through the rd brake light area. The reason why I dislike what the hyperlink posted before is because if you have to get your spare its one more thing to take on and off  to change your tire. If you had access to a welder you could use a flat plate that would mount under your rd brake light and weld a piece of angle steel or flat steel to the back and make a mount tab that would also work,jeeptechnical,cxguuwq,1,t5_31n4s

The wrangler is shaped like a brick... its like pushing a massive piece of plywood at highway speed.  I would NEVER drive my wrangler  mph and Im not even positive it could get there!  Not to mention that at that point you could probably watch the gas gauge visibly falling!,jeeptechnical,d2fkibo,2,t5_31n4s
