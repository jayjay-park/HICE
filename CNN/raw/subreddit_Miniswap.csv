10149320,0,t3_5krw6l,Regarding your edit our festering Nurgle prince uSquoze posted a fabulous guide a few months ago here Otherwise just general tips Most people dont include cost of shipping in asking prices. If you want to thats fine USPS has a ton of nice flat rate boxes but you could probably find something cheaper by not going flat rate depending on where youre shipping obviously not the case necessarily for MA to CA shiping etc. Other selling subs have different policy depending on their community HWSwap has shipping almost always included in price from my experience. People can easily get new models for between  and  of MSRP which means asking for that much wont get you a lot of traction. I like to pick up new  assembled  primed stuff at closer to  MSRP but im not sure if Ive been over  under paying pricewise. Inventories being thorough and pictures being available can make or break a sale. Ive walked away from stuff that I was interested in because I couldnt get a pic or a clear explanation of what was being offered I know other people will do the same too. Specifying whats current and whats OOP will also help if youre getting an inventory before taking pics. Some people dislike buying finecast or pewter stuff so specifying that as well would be helpful.Also youll want to decide if youre willing to sell stuff piecemeal or as full lots.,Miniswap,dbugj0h,2,t5_2sm6t
