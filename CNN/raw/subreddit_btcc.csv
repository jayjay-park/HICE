111475,0,t3_1tn3nc,Oulton Park  Race  was great midpack drivers finding themselves at the front and driving at  of their abilities sometimes overdriving to keep their spot. Croft  had lots of good racing as well Croft seems like a place that guarantees entertaining racing. I cant find the races though.Also from the S era Id recommend you to watch the  Season Review a great season with a tense ending and lots of great racing. Croft or Rockingham to name a few and the Finale at Brands Hatch had everyone on the edge of their seat. Man I miss Fabrizio Giovanardi.,btcc,cer4hb4,1,t5_2sl35

3480540,0,t1_cpozuh2,Astounding achievement.It was naive of me to think he was new when he drove the Primera in the late s.Only learned last year that wasnt the case.,btcc,cpp08x4,2,t5_2sl35
4012663,0,t1_crczmy7,Ill definitely make sure to check out those support races too,btcc,crdoak0,1,t5_2sl35
4194269,0,t1_crycd6n,He went straight on at one of the corners and had to go round the old circuit to rejoin in pretty much last place.,btcc,crycesx,2,t5_2sl35
4941221,0,t1_cuhcfrr,Well he says hed be happy with either drivetrain just the manufacturer thatd give him the most support. Im sure those  Series have at least another season in them. ,btcc,cuhdoyq,3,t5_2sl35
5232794,0,t1_cvgpzcq,I think he might look to that eventually but he signed to stay in the BTCC with Pirtek for the next three years just before SnettertonI think Pirtek will follow him wherever he goes but theyll want him to stay in the BTCC as the brand exposure with TV here in the UK doesnt compare to WRX.Just a question now of where he could realistically go. ,btcc,cvgqqeq,2,t5_2sl35
5362796,0,t3_3ognlu,Always a good racer I just hope he has better sponsorship opportunities over this winter break. Last year it looked pretty bleak even though he was the championship winner!,btcc,cvx5p2g,1,t5_2sl35

10167648,0,t1_dbwjv2v,It is isnt it? The first full season of the WTCC I watched at the time. Didnt know most of the drivers but knew Thommo from watching BTCC on MotorsTV before. He finished third in the standings which was pretty amazing considering Alfa pulled out their support for the N.Tech team.,btcc,dbwk4lu,1,t5_2sl35
