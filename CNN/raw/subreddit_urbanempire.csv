Id allow myself to spend a little over half of the monthly income so Id always be making money even if my treasury slipped into the negative. If I could use a service to make my people happier Id do that. If I felt my people were sufficiently happy Id expand. But either way Id try to make it so that the monthly cost of the project was less than my current monthly income. Now for full disclosure my treasury was tens of millions in the positive and negative at different points of the game because there are fluxuations. But as long as you have enough leftists on the council you can tax your way out of any hole. I was playing the Killgallons and honestly there were times when I wanted to lower taxes but they council wouldnt let me so I built more!,urbanempire,dcqjv3d,2,t5_3d3dh
