202719,1,t1_cf11tig,And yet you take it on faith that God is right. You take plenty of things on faith. We all do. Its all that we can hope to do. But why are so many people so sure they have Gods plans correct for instance when it comes to the correctness of the Bible when they must concede that they cannot know Gods plan is the reason to not doubt Him when it comes to matters like Hell which clash with our intuitions about what is right and wrong?If by our free will we are to accept that we cannot use that free will to know why God gave us free will then there is no reason we should not accept take that the same free cannot be used to know whether the Bible is correct or whether God did any such thing as create a Hell because he wanted to give humans free will. ALL of its beyond our comprehension. You have no more a complete understanding of the correctness of the Bible than you do of God Himself. None of us do. But politics are run the world over based on whether or not God made Israel His Holy Land or forbade homosexuality long ago when He used to speak to humans directly or created a Hell for those who sin according to some prescribed list of wrongs dictated to us ages ago.We take it on faith that the Bible is right but if any of us decided to take it on faith that God did not create a Hell wed be wrong.

I simply stated that the church as a whole is noticeably changing its outward views towards what sin is. A rapist will surly feel Hell when he dies a man who loves a man isnt going to feel Hell when he dies. Atheist who have been accepted by the Pope are not damned because they question God the same thought can be applied to anyone of another faith.Also churches are led by mere men and just because a cluster of ignorance says one thing like gays will suffer does not mean this is true.I wish I had numbers to measure the change in the church however I can only point to what figureheads are saying as measureable change like the Pope.,QuotesPorn,cg1tgbc,0,t5_2spqb
541520,0,t1_cg1nn8b,It is a good point and I agree that this should be questioned.  But dont assume that all Christian churches lack a decent answer.As Ive been taught our faults and weaknesses such as a tendency to sin were not created directly by God but instead are an indirect result of God giving us unique personalities and free will.  Without this wed effectively be robots.In addition He provided us with the means to overcome our weaknesses and faults through the Atonement.  Ultimately we are only blamed for willfully refusing His help.Side note not every church teaches that those who die before they are old enough to accept Him or are never taught will be condemned with the rest.,QuotesPorn,cg1tsjz,7,t5_2spqb

Is God blaming us or not? Your initial post I referenced saidgt When did God blame humans?Now in this post you seem to be saying that God is justified in blaming us when you saygt How can we not be blamed when we are the ones who make the choices?I saidgt  If god allows them to go to hell for their sins that they be punished it then follows that he deems them responsible for their actions and accountable for them and are therefore being blamed for them.You saidgt Man went against Gods instructions and as such paid the ultimate penalty for disobedienceSo I saidgt So then God is allowing men to pay penalty for actions man cannot be blamed for?Either God blames men for their sins or he punishes them or allows them to be punished for sins he does not blame them for.

And thats what made them soilders Halsey would have had them be machines. But Mendez taught them how to love not a romantic love but a love that is defined by the fact that you trust hour comrades completely and utterly you know none of you will let the team down. That is what made the SPARTAN soilders not just machines built for war but soilders. People. Their tether to humanity. Halsey... Halsey in my opinion is incapable of feeling love as we know it. That would require empathy that quite frankly Halsey doesnt have. She may feel some sort of twisted strange possessive feeling of love or guilt or just insanity... but love? No I dont think she knows what love is. The SPARTANS love eachother. Keyes loved Miranda. Cheif loves Cortana. The SPARTANS loved eachother. But Halsey... Halsey is different. Shes not able to connect with people. Trust does not exist to her. She will defend her actions no matter how cruel or terrible but not only that she will act as if humanity should thank her. I think the only love she feels for the SPARTANS is a love for her legacy. She watched these children grow up and Instinct kicked in. She had the instinct to protect them to love them. What human doesnt? Were wired that way. But being how she is I think shes more confused than anything. I dont think she can comprehend what you or I call love,QuotesPorn,cgd1b05,1,t5_2spqb

I could fill lifetimes of activities.  Learn to fix your car garden read history do pushups go for a walk.  If you know scientists youll definitely know Richard Feynman did what he wanted every minute of the day.  I read his autobiography and he had lots of little hobbies.  Whenever he saw ants outside hed conduct little experiments to try to figure them out.  When he saw a safe hed play with the knob and try to pick it.  Productivity can come out of the strangest places which is something I think the movement very strong on reddit to fill your life with something tangibly productive either working out or learning a marketable skill every second of the day is kind of missing something.  If you take a break you might end up being more productive or at the very least be ready to take on the world with some perspective.I think a lot of people have been conditioned to think that life is binary theres work and then theres TV time.

1683426,0,t1_cjrbfze,I would imagine that the statement is based upon the deistic conception of god as a designer or grand architect as those of the founding fathers who were free masons or enlightened rationalists would imagine god to be.  Such an image ascribes to god the characteristics of a deity who is tempered by reason observes rather than interferes with worldly affairs and natural events leaves men to their liberty and grants their free will both in deed and in thought.  This is in opposition to the biblical god espoused through time who judges castigates condemns commands and spies on mind and heart. Thus such a god as the former by nature of the deep understanding he nodoubt as creator and source of all mind must understand that the mind of man will move in directions which may arrive at conclusions that contradict the necessity of deity and even find them laudable in so far as the creation indeed as one might say it should strives to become independent of its creator. ,QuotesPorn,cjrcxc4,3,t5_2spqb
1684559,0,t1_cjrg31v,Many of the founding fathers were deists or otherwise took a skeptical eye toward religion andor the institutions behind it. Their ideas were not necessarily shared by everyone though. Remember a lot of our earliest settlers and oldest immigrant American families came here to practice their puritanical religious rights. So they favored religious freedom so far as they were free to worship in whatever ways they couldnt back in Europe. These are the basis of the people that eventually ran many of the colonies. Meanwhile many founding fathers like Jefferson took a point of view more in line with the conventions of the Enlightenment and The Age of Reason and they lived in the days of the foundations of modern science. It was popular at the time to be looking back at some of the most fundamental facts of Western Literature and Culture and ask Why? Its a very important even pivotal point in time but its also good to remember that it didnt happen in a vacuum. Some of the colonies were heavily religious. So after independence and the Continental Congress even though the federal government was built to be separated from religion many state governments were closely tied with their local religious orders. So when you see people today that claim wrongly that the US is a Christian Nation or feel that Religion is in our government theyre wrong but not so wrong as we may like to think. The government was built at least at the federal level to exist behind a wall of separation so that religion cannot pull strings in government and the government cannot restrict what we may believe about god. But a lot of people in the Southeast particularly come from a tradition where religion is at least as infocus to them as the state and Ive met people that have serious trouble understanding how the two could ever be separate. It may be tactless to say but it almost seems like a learning disability of some kind. Some people literally cant understand a separation of church and state. They cant fathom a life without god or the church and extend that lack of understanding to the state. How could it function without religion guiding their morals? They have no idea. These are the people that you typically see fighting to put Christian influence back in the government because they see it as always being there no matter how often you point out to them that the people who laid the framework for this nation explicitly forbid that.,QuotesPorn,cjri35n,26,t5_2spqb

I mean we attribute quotes to Mark Twain not Huck Finn right?Look at it this way do you credit the President for a quote or his speechwriter?Granted the President is not a fictional character but he didnt write those words either so my point is a policy one at least as far as this sub is concerned which is more important who wrote it or who popularly said it?  Im aware that not every TV episode is written by committee and some shows like Breaking Bad credit only one writer but if your goal is to credit the person that person that actually wrote the words its in many cases achievable.  Quoting a fictional character does not obscure the original writer those who want to know can still trace it back easily and those who dont care recognize it.  Crediting the writer if you can actually ascertain that would inevitably lead to a great deal of confusion as to the sourcecontext and could in some cases completely misrepresent the writer if presented as a direct quote as submissions here so often are.Dont get me wrong I understand the conflict however my opinion is that the most easily recognizable name would likely be the best choice whether author or character.,QuotesPorn,ckvscca,2,t5_2spqb

Its not the apex of human accomplishment but interpersonal relationships are the core of what keeps us together as a culture and society. It doesnt matter how intelligent someone is if theyre so abrasive that they drive everyone away. Where you see some vast conspiracy I see people responding to a universal desire for authentic relationships with those they care about. Youre clearly a sharp guy but youve also gota heavy chip on your shoulder. The chances of some random guy on the internet getting through to you is pretty slim but dont let whatever has hurt you in the past stop you from living a full life.

3905699,0,t1_cr0tgpa,The book Freakanomics addressed this fairly conclusively repeated here in an article by the authors.gt But the ECLS data show no correlation between a childs test scores and how often his parents read to him...gt Now back to the original riddle How can it be that a child with a lot of books in her home does well at school even if she never reads them? Because parents who buy a lot of childrens books tend to be smart and welleducated to begin with  and they pass on their smarts and work ethic to their kids. This theory is supported by the fact that the number of books in a home is just as strongly correlated with math scores as reading scores. Or the books may suggest that these are parents who care a great deal about education and about their children in general which results in an environment that rewards learning. Such parents may believe that a book is a talisman that leads to unfettered intelligence. But they are probably wrong. A book is in fact less a cause of intelligence than an indicator.,QuotesPorn,cr1hfny,2,t5_2spqb

What if the user participated in a tradein program so it was inexpensive? Are they supposed to spend money on things that are only essential because they dont deserve to have ONE nice thing?Secondly not having a college degree for many people is a choice to NOT go  in debt. For a large percentage of my generation college is simply not an option. Plus theres no guarantee that after theyve racked up massive amounts of debt that theyd be able to get a job. The cost of an education is outrageous and Id wager impossible for someone in a minimum wage job. In  the average cost of tuition was  per year. Today its about  per year and can be much much higher. A minimum wage worker makes about  a year. How could anyone live off of hardly more than  a month when rent alone is easily twothirds of that. Education? No way. Not to mention food transportation all the basic things people need to survive. What about unexpected illness? Saving you can forget about all together. Just because they arent highly specialized and educated doesnt mean they need to live in squalor. Many people I know work two jobs or more just to barely get by each month. There are lots of people my age whos parents didnt provide a plan for education or lifestarting and have no real path to improve their circumstances because they have to work  hours a week to barely scrape by.

Its just an emergent property of logic. Anything that can execute logic gates can run code and arguably run something like Windows. Its an emergent property of the system which is structured to execute the code. Naturally. Its unable to be separated from the system but what the system is made out of doesnt matter. And therefore its nonphysical but dependent on physical things in order to exist and execute.Unless you are saying that a Galaxy S executing Android and a Galaxy S executing android are exciting two different pieces of software. Which is absurd since I can write software for android that runs on both hardware. However a Galaxy S running Linux instead will not be able to run my code. The software is independent but relies on the hardware.gtits like saying that threebody problem is there even if there are no bodies ...Im not familiar with the problem so your analogy falls flat. Sorry.gti dont see how you can demonstrate consciousness exists thru time. Unless you are a pzombie or reject that you are indeed the same person throughout your life you must necessarily accept this premise. If you are a pzombie naturally you wont be able to understand the topic at hand. If you reject that you are the same person then who am I talking to?gtthat you personally have an illusion of it being contiguous is not proofIts not so much the illusion of it being contiguous. I accept that and indeed reject that I am the same person from last comment. However that comes with a very difficult question which I answered If this is the case then how come you observed both independent states? If you didnt you wouldnt have any perception of the past that is youd only see a single state for eternity. If you did you must answer the question. Theres only two possible answers That consciousness itself is nonphysical and not reliant on physical matter to exist I reject this idea or that every consciousness instance of it is the same subjective entity. Again this is makes it a nonphysical entity which is contingent on a physical thing just like the other things Im talking about. Both of these answers necessarily reject your view.So either you are an idiot or a pzombie. And given how many people fail this test and then outright deny theres any subjective experience Im willing to bet Ive just come up with a pzombie test these same people also reject the idea of qualia have issues when talking about sensory information reject the idea of lucid dreaming etc.gt shall we agree that if the universe consisted of unbound atoms there would be no math?Nope.

4775157,0,t1_ctwfjdt,gt  I also like the one about Those willing to give up liberty for security... but they also say Ben Franklin didnt say that one.He did write it but the full quote is Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety from the letter Pennsylvania Assembly Reply to the Governor dated November  .The thing that most people miss is tht Franklin isnt actually talking about personal liberty in the letter. Hes writing as a Pennsylvania legislator to the Governor of Pennsylvania. The Governor was appointed by the very wealthy and powerful Penn family and was doing the Penn familys bidding in a matter. Basically the Pennsylvania legislature wanted to tax the Penn familys lands to raise money for the militia to defend against the attacks of the French and Indian War. The Penn family didnt want to be taxed but were willing to give a large sum of money as long as the legislature agreed they wouldnt be taxed at all in the future. Thats why the words essential temporary and purchase are important. Hes literally talking about the Penn family trying to buy their way out of the ability of the Pennsylvania government being able to tax them which he believes is an essential part of governance for the temporary safety their payment would provide.

I interpret it more as for example if Castro was a puppet master behind the scenes while the regime had a more seemingly benign face people conceivably would be less aware of the evil that was around them.

5754590,0,t1_cxae9u7,Well you are describing a different thing entirely. As an artist behaving as you described you are not charging people an hourly rate you are charging them for a finished piece. This is your choice and is entirely different than large scale macroscopic economics. You describe things with anecdotal illfitting evidence to support your claim that government interference is a gun and power and that power corrupts. This is not a well constructed argument.And it ignores the fact I mentioned government interference as only one of many options. The workers and the capital holders come to an agreement between how much the capital holder is recompensed. That gives the capital holder incredible power just as much if not more power that the government gun you claim to hate so much.And I listed a number of ways that workers can hope to influence the capital holder to give them a better deal. They can unionise for example controlling the workforce in a similar way capital holders control the the capital. And they can individually choose not to participate in unequal negotiations. Wages and prices do derive from economic laws and as a person who has studied those mathematical laws I can tell you they end poorly for the workers if they do not choose some form of negotiation tactic. By economic laws alone capital holders amass more and more capital and the workers are paid less and less for their work as their options for investment dwindle to fewer and fewer capital holders who provide lower and lower wages.That is an economic law unless the worker addresses the balance in some way. How they choose to do so is up to them.,QuotesPorn,cxaeu0c,22,t5_2spqb

5921929,0,t1_cxv3emm,I completely agree with you but...heres what does worry me. Jons argument depends in some ways on a certain ratio. As technology continues to progress the destructive power of the individual will also continue to increase. Right now a couple dozen determined people can kill thousands with a little luck. And weve seen the results of what that does to our politics. Individual rights are restricted in an effort to protect society from the growing power of the individual.So what happens a thousand years from now? What happens when a dozen dedicated people could kill millions? I guess in some sense this is a problem of scale. We had our classical understanding of physics based on a very limited scale of observations. And today we have our classical morality based on the relative weakness of the individual to cause massive devastation. We may come to realize there is a revolution in society that will occur when individuals begin to have what were considered godlike abilities in our ancient past. And Im not sure I like to imagine what that revolution will mean for the freedom of the individual given what only a small fraction of it is doing to our current societies.Hey at least well all probably be dead by then.,QuotesPorn,cxvw9xm,1,t5_2spqb

7720896,0,t3_4l0lak,Nice little read even if none of it is truegtThe Three Final Wishes of Alexander the Great Alexander was a great Greek king. As a military commander he was undefeated and the most successful throughout history. On his way home from conquering many countries he came down with an illness. At that moment his captured territories powerful army sharp swords and wealth all had no meaning to him. He realized that death would soon arrive and he would be unable to return to his homeland. He told his officers I will soon leave this world. I have three final wishes. You need to carry out what I tell you. His generals in tears agreed.gtMy first wish is to have my physician bring my coffin home alone. After a gasping for air Alexander continued My second wish is scatter the gold silver and gems from my treasurehouse along the path to the tomb when you ship my coffin to the grave. After wrapping in a woolen blanket and resting for a while he said My final wish it to put my hands outside the coffin. People surrounding him all were very curious but no one dare to ask the reason. Alexanders most favored general kissed his hand and asked My Majesty We will follow your instruction. But can you tell us why you want us to do it this way? After taking a deep breath Alexander said I want everyone to understand the three lessons I have learned. To let my physician carry my coffin alone is to let people realize that a physician cannot really cure peoples illness. Especially when they face death the physicians are powerless. I hope people will learn to treasure their lives. My second wish is to tell people not to be like me in pursuing wealth. I spent my whole life pursuing wealth but I was wasting my time most of the time. My third wish to let people understand that I came to this world in empty hands and I will leave this world also in empty hands. he closed his eyes after finished talking and stopped breathing.,QuotesPorn,d3jta5e,16,t5_2spqb

There used to be commercials ads etc everywhere for tobacco products just like there are for every other product in the world. When was the last time you saw a Marlboro Man or Joe Camel on your TV? And by the way those antitobacco commercials are made almost entirely by Philip Morris. RJReynolds the second largest US tobacco company doesnt pay for the truth ads. gt You mean the warning on the box that everyone knows is completely ineffective at getting anyone to quit? Thats exactly the fluff Im talking about.Again no. I meant what I said shocking I know. But if youll step down off your high horse again the government forced tobacco companies to abide by packaging restrictions  things are nearly as flashy or eye catching on the physical package anymore. gt The new Deeming Regulations bring cigars in line with the Tobacco Control Act and Im fine with that because theyre tobacco. gt Thats right the government thats helping to curb smoking rates is literally doing so by exempting actual tobacco products from regulations that are as strict as a product with zero tobacco in it.Cigars will be taxed at the higher rate soon that is correct. The only sidestepping that occurs for predicate products on the market before Feb .  is allowing the cigarscigarettes to not have to be retested by the FDA if those companies can prove that the product they have on the market today is the exact same as the one they were selling in . They dont get a tax break or anything like that they simply dont have to retest something that the FDA the company and the consumer already know what it is. Because testing costs manpower and money and ultimately is a waste of both the tobacco companies and the FDAs time. If there are any changes however they still have to go through the FDA approval process just like it was a brand new product.

8296778,0,t1_d5emncm,Yeah and I dont think that is the case at all. I dont buy for a second that in England the church and peoples general religious beliefs has absolutely no influence on the state. The entire country is shaped  in part by its religion and understandably so as is the case for most countries that have a majority religious populace and Im not sure there are any that dont. If anything the state of religion is much more normalized and accepted towards Christianity so the issue doesnt present itself frequently in politics until it is challenged.gtBecause no one really cares for religion.A significant majority of the UK is religious at . I dont think thats accurate at all. Its especially inaccurate once you consider the reactions towards the growth of other religions. The firebombing of mosques and general apathy in the UK towards it is indicative of this. gtYou have politicians proclaiming their belief in Christianity and your laws and political structure is often weighed down by religion because you have a religious population.Im not denying this is the case but I am saying that its not significantly different from other Western states. ,QuotesPorn,d5enlya,3,t5_2spqb

As for the meantime look at the support youre receiving from reddit! We do care. If you can try to get medication for your anxiety that could help. Support groups for depression are free where I live maybe its the same for you? I imagine the gym would be very hard when dealing with those issues but I have social anxiety and I promise that people dont care and most people at gym keep to themselves. The first time will be the hardest but it gets exponentially easier after that. I should add that the book I recommended makes a very important point. There is a need for you to become okay with being alone. Yes it can such but when you start showing yourself self respect it builds self esteem it creates self boundaries and eventually self confidence. Begin working on yourself and making your body and mind strong. The gym mindfulness meditation challenging yourself to make new friends going to meetups in your area fi ding new hobbies learning new skills these will all create self respect.,QuotesPorn,d87cayw,1,t5_2spqb

Its a lot of fun but the hours are long indeed...piglets are a lot of fun for the first month. You keep your sows happy because happy sows are better moms and have a lot of piglets.   The crate solves the problem of the mom rolling over on her litter which happens quite a bit. She is uncomfortable from giving birth shes tired and the new piglets cant move very well or even yelp.  Most sows will get up and reposition but many cannot because they are too tired.  The crate also solves the problem of getting myself run over by a sow.  You will vaccinate and castrate pigs and they dont like this and will give out a yelp to mom.  Mom takes these yelps very seriously and will do her best to flatten you if she could....If the number of litters exceed the number of crates we put them in the field with a small quonset hut and theyll build a nest out of hay. The mortality rate is about  above crates. It also makes it hell trying to deal with the piglets see above. This is quote is taken out of context and bogus.

11073528,0,t1_den4bjw,Im not the one bitching here you are. I started off pretty civil but you immediately retorted that my point was bullshit and that Im delusional and insane without providing any evidence for your point of view. Of course thats pretty typical of a conservative this day and age. And its pretty hilarious you think Im wrong despite the fact I have been kicking your ass all day by actually citing sources. And not just liberal ones. Actual centrist sources and conservative as well. I never called the right pure evil. Now youre just putting words in my mouth since you have no legs to stand on. And of course theres whole media brainwashing blurb right on time. At least I dont pull my opinions straight out of my ass like youve been doing. And dont act like you feel the same way about the left even though its obvious you have no clue what the left really is.And if the right is closer to how you think why the fuck is Sessions AG? Why the fuck are they implementing policies you disagree with like antabortion and antiLGBT measures? And why in the ever loving fuck did you people let Trump get the nomination?Hmmmmm I wonder what political party those police unions and sheriffs associations are more likely to align with? Hint Its the one with the elephant.Let me guess Youre male white probably married aged somewhere from the late s to s and definitely from the South. Deducting for this and judging by your demeanor and your stances its clear that you suffer from the conservative persecution complex that is becoming increasingly common in your demographic.

11212810,0,t1_df2ya08,Low income people vote primarily democrat. Mostly because democrats run a tax platform based on taxing the wealthy and redistributing that wealth to poor democrats.  I would call this skirting taxes.  Its really easy to claim the other guy should pay and not me. That was the basis of my original post.  Democrats can bitch and moan about cutting funding to the arts.   But the stats dont lie.  They are not the ones paying the tax.  If PBS is so important to people go donate.  No one is making public broadcasting illegal.  If half the country and all those actually paying taxes for it dont want to fund it I dont see why the other half of the country should be able to force them to pay for it.  ,QuotesPorn,df2yjdb,3,t5_2spqb
