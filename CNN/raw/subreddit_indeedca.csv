382074,0,t1_cfk50uj,Well of course we are all on the same page like I didnt know that. Though I like selling on ebay I can not find a steady supply to keep me even in pocket money. Too sporadic. I have other skills would not call them mad skills and interests which I am unable to explore due to being a pauper. If I could figure out how to combine a few things into a part time gig things would look up a little.....,indeedca,cfkd87d,1,t5_306n2

859535,0,t1_ch1vydq,Dmarie my honest take?  I was surprised they reached back to you in the first place after receiving your angry response.  You just cant do that in business and expect a positive outcome.  I DO understand your utter frustration and anger at getting rejected so fast from the outset but you have to keep moving along with the applications until you can get an interview.  Im sorry they seemingly acted like they were interested only to reject you again.  Its a hard lesson learned but never show potential employers a negative side.  The outcome will never go in your favor.  ,indeedca,ch1zfqo,1,t5_306n2

1168056,0,t1_ci0bbby,Had plumbing issues dealt with.  They tell you its not so invasive but they do plenty of cutting on the inside in places you cant see.  Trust me the recovery was not fun and I am not so sure it solved what it was supposed to solve.  I may need more recovery to know how successful it was.  Im just happy to be up and around like usual.,indeedca,ci10yns,1,t5_306n2
