Is not MLP anymore it hasnt been for a long time.I really wish this association with MLP stopped already. Another thing that most people dont seem to realize is that the mane team couldnt be happier that the game is no longer about ponies because now they have their own original IP that they can actually profit from.For how long is this subreddit going to keep posting about this game?There will be posts about their funding campaing too?

6821,0,t3_1u75b8,Personally I think that those who do sexualize it do so not because they find the characters physically attractive although there are some who do but theyre in the minority but that they have developed mental and emotional attachments to them and that leads to a desire for physical intimacy as well.  Of course the very very large majority also realize that these characters are not real and will never be but still the mind is an odd place of imagination.  It just makes sense to me that some people would behave in this way.  Serious question for you have you never found a fictional character attractive and I do mean not for their physical traits only at least?  its the same thing really.,mylittlepony,cef7oni,2,t5_2s8bl

29616,0,t1_cehlfj8,I thought I heard that they hired on a bunch of bronies and other pony enthusiasts which worried me at the time. The writing seems so far removed from what the show started out with a few seasons back. The writing is a lot more adultfocused  I suppose they are catering to their unintended target audience. Everythings saturated in pop culture references and characters doing something peculiar for the sake of a joke. I liked the show when it was just a show for little girls  I dont need all that other stuff to keep myself entertained  in fact its making me enjoy the show just a little less. On top of that the fact that the stories themselves are so different from the ones in season   in season  the focus seemed on relationships and the mysteries and adventure were the backdrop  take Dragonshy It has a dragon in it but the majority of the episode revolves around Fluttershy and her fears. Now the action seems to have taken the center stage  superheroes vampires Indiana Jones Haunted Castles. I hope at least that is a trend thats broken with this latest episode but Im pretty sure well have to endure the endless string of jokes and references throughout the season.,mylittlepony,cehsy87,4,t5_2s8bl

39204,0,t1_ceiud6r,Im not talking about event such as the Winter Wrap Up which by tradition frown upon magic use or the tornado which the unicorns could have helped but it sounds like its a kind of challenge events.I can understand a training camp being related to a specific practice of a discipline. Such as the flight camp But again... Could a very talented unicorn take part in it if they can summon wings all the time? Its called Flight Camp... not School for talented Pegasi.However in this case its a school about magic. Yeah someone could point up that the school may very well be about magic practice more than magic knowledge or magic spell design or theorycraft. Its a notion that wasnt talked about much in the show yet. Imagine an earth pony getting a cutie mark about magic knowledge design theory. What would they do? Is there a school for somepony like that? Someone could argue that Celestias school is the best when it comes to magic and could be very well an heart breaker for a pony talented in magic to be forever prevented from attending it. Can the knowledge offered there be also offered in another school? Maybe... But so far the show didnt offer any clue about that.,mylittlepony,ceiw7a2,1,t5_2s8bl

Furthermore no one is forcing you to sit there at the screen and read this comic. As Ive heard many times before and vehemently stand behind You do not have the right to not be offended. If I dont like homophobic comedians making jokes about that fag over there I dont buy their products or see their shows.If I dont like a comic book I dont buy it off the rack or download a .cbr or whatever else. If I think Rob Liefeld cant draw a woman or anything really to save his life I dont go trying to tell publishers they cant hire Rob Liefeld anymore because his work is offensive.

Shes consistently choosing loyalty and friendship over the draw of that admiration and yet shes somehow managing to retain her sense of wonder at the Wonderbolts too.I suggested to a friend that Dash should set up her own display team. She could probably attract Soarin to it and itd be far better than the Wonderbolts.

And also just because they have americium doesnt mean theyve discovered all the other radioactive elements the periodic table iswas something filled in over time not completed upon its discovery. And no atom bombs were not my first thought when he mentioned plutonium. I was actually thinking of The Simpsons and even G MLP had nuclear power. Hazmat suits may be ideal against biological attacks but theyre also ideal against the thread of natural viruses and disease which is why thats what we saw them used for in the ep. The author himself points out that air raid sirens are used for dangerous weather or other attacks. Like well . . . dragons. Pony Saudi Arabia doesnt necessitate Al Quada anymore than pony Manehattan requires a compete analogue to American geography and history including pony Salem witch hanging and Pony KKK amp Civil Rights Era.

They all excel in what they do for their respective medium and will not be uprooted as the go to sites for content Any attempt to do so will only be time wasted and people will take you a little less seriously. But to my knowledge there isnt a website dedicated to videos. So if you focus on hosting optimizing and sorting video content then the website will have the greatest chance of taking off.

305416,0,t3_1xlg03,Alicorns are like the lamest superheroes. If you are picking an OC and lets say it is to represent yourself as a pony which most people view OCs as even though this isnt always true you are usually choosing between earth unicorn pegasi and maybe other varients if need be. Now when I was picking an OC I was thinking a pegasus at first but I thought Id love to have my character do magic too. I almost considered making him an alicorn but I realized how boring that would be. If he was an alicorn it would be almost the equivalent of being a flawless person and it could reflect on me for having a big ego. Alicorns when there was just Celestia and Luna in the picture were considered gods because of their immortality and immense power.Limits are great when it comes to characters because it becomes their strengths. This doesnt mean cripple your OC it means dont make it over powered.Alicorn OCs can only sometimes work for me so I wont spite them immediately. Theyre like rap songs.

340055,0,t3_1xzkwp,flutterwhoaWe open with Fluttershy singing and the others discovering that she has an amazing voice.  Of course this is hilariously ironic because the entire show is often filled with music and all of them singing.spWow Fluttershy Ive never heard you sing with such an amazing voice.YES YOU HAVE TWILIGHT.  YOUVE ALL HEARD HER SING.swagintoshThen were introduced to the Ponytones with a brilliant a capella performance.  Apparently Big Mac is a talented bass singer.  As he is quickly identified as an important member of the group anyone who had already seen the synopsis knew where this was headed.  The only thing missing that I had wanted to see was the turkey call that ruined his voice.spppseesyouI cant talk about this episode without pointing out Pinkie Pie.  What the hell girl?  Maybe she was just written that way for this episode to emphasize Fluttershys fears but really she was one snooty attitude away from being all Diamond Tiara on one of her best friends.  It was really hard to tell if she meant well through the entire thing.spfluttershhAnywho back to Fluttershy.  Zecoras remedy was quick but a new conflict quickly arises as more ponies take notice of the Ponytones and Fluttershy gets more and more into the singing.  I was pleased to see that Rarity and the others let Fluttershy continue to sing because she wanted to rather than the group identifying her voice to be better than Big Macs so they guilt her into singing a path this episode easily could have taken.  We all knew it would fall apart and Fluttershy would be revealed as the real singer and it was a great buildup to that moment where I feel even the audience could get into her passion for singing.  I started harmonizing too that song is brilliant.spflutterwinkFluttershy overcoming her stage fright was rather rushed in my opinion.  Then again I dont know how it could have been written any other way without the entire episode being about different ways Fluttershy could overcome that stage fright.  It still culminated nicely to the lesson and Im glad it ended the way it did.  Both of Fluttershys voices are amazing and I would buy ten of her albums in a heartbeat.spflutteryayThis was definitely one of those feelgood episodes with a feelgood lesson. Face your fears so you can be the best you that you can be.  It was a very FIM episode that I felt could have fit in nicely with the happygoluckiness of season  but definitely bolstered season  as a colorful season as well.spLets see whats going on next weeALL RIGHT CMCS!

354210,0,t3_1y3lsu,Thats why I made sure to mention in my uber long fanboying of the episode that In this episode Fluttershys established fear of social interaction takes the form of stage fright.The great thing that sets this episode apart from the others is that since there have already been several dealing with her self confidence and fears this one changed the formula by making her victory moment come halfway through the episode by singing behind the curtains.This allowed us to see for the first time the joy she can achieve even without changing herself and made her first step towards fighting her fear much more meaningful.It was also spectacular at showing how good friends can be understanding and help you with these issues.,mylittlepony,cfhhbhg,2,t5_2s8bl

I used to get mercilessly teased by those assholes yet I distinctly remember one time where the guy I hated most was actually nice to me and even asked if I wanted to hang out after school.I was so excited that I went ballstothewall cleaning my room setting up all of my action figures getting dressed nicely doing absolutely everything I could think of to make myself look better and impress him.He never came. Didnt even mention it the next day just went back to bullying me.So yeah I definitely relate to that shit and I am a grown ass adult.,mylittlepony,cfmtab5,1,t5_2s8bl

409044,0,t1_cfn5c8w,most of the real life bronies ive met are like me adult male in s. only one has had the sense of humor id expect a person to have but then again sometimes i realize im a bit dark with mine so i can slightly understand some of these guys. but as far as episodes go be in on this subreddit or in real life people didnt like me saying something was bad. writer or whatever i never go after people that i dont know like that just saying in general. for example ive stated that i thought season  was in fact a pure pile of crap. ive stated though that with season  being an unexpected hit and season  topping that by leaps and bounds i can understand season  being not as good but to me it was just bad. i take it up with it being rushed and cut and no Faust. But everytime ive stated this ive been downvoted to hell in this subreddit with replys calling me stupid i laugh at that honestly the intensity a kids show causes and in real life being told i am dumb for not liking it lol. in current discussions with the one brony who understands some self hated humor i mentioned earilier calls me a cynical did i use the right spelling on that one? asshole because ive said most of the episodes in the current season have just been alright. not as good as the first two but not as bad as the rd with one episode in particular being terrible up till the end. Guess it might be a area thing but i did forget to state one thing this subreddit does that annoys the piss out of me. the constant spamming of a stupid object or face from the show. current examples being that stupid cane the dumb rainbow dash face the duck face and so on and so forth. its been going on for awhile before hand and ive always found it dumb. personal thing there i guess. also sure on the figurine. lol. actually a model custom one at that. from the game Warhammer k. you can even see in the background Pinkie lol. actually kind of nice discussion too thanks for not going off and actually asking why i dislike bronies lol.  ,mylittlepony,cfn5wzl,2,t5_2s8bl

I think that the reason I enjoy Cooks work so much is that since everyone is so over the top I subconsciously? read it like it is a fanfic and judged on comedy fanfic terms it is quite good. But its good in a way similar to an abridged series. I have fun along the ride but I also know it wouldnt be canon for Luna to spend the better part of a day hanging out with Big Mac who she doesnt know at all at a random ponyville fair. The big exception to this being the Rarity micro which I actually could see as an episode that would have aired on the Hub. Youve given me a new appreciation for writers like Ted Anderson who arent willing to let characterization slip just because its a different platform from the main show.Also ohmygosh the annual was so awesome despite having no right to be. They took the EQG movie that people mainly liked because of the songs and animation despite its lackluster story and managed to make a comic book read no music or animation whose story was hamstrung by being a prequel read the audience knows ahead of time exactly how it has to end that was arguably more enjoyable than the movie?

If I had to hazard a guess Id say probably libertarian considering how the other ideologies seem more focused on the collective group and bronyism isnt yet mainstream enough to really be a sizable demographic in any collective.

712107,0,t3_22b1gi,This is slightly misleading in that before the  example given here there are quite a lot of previous pieces in his gallery which show a lot of knowledge about lighting anatomy colour theory and so on.The difference is that the  example of Rainbow Dash marks an early attempt at using a new more cartoony style that Tsitra wasnt used to. The transition between styles is clearly very jarring and you can see this in the huge difference in quality between his other most dragon related paintings and the cartoony pony drawings from . At this point he was already working off a solid foundation of knowledge which explains a lot of the rapid adjustment and improvement to the  example.Clearly if someone were to begin drawing today they could not quite expect this level of rapid improvement unless they dedicated every waking hour to it. So in some ways I can see how this might actually be discouraging in that it gives the appearance of an artist learning way faster than is actually possible. In actual fact Tsitra started off much better than the first example shows because hed already spent a long time learning and honing his skills.This is similar to how Atryls first pony drawing looked incredibly underwhelming compared to the other realisticfantasy drawings he was doing prior to drawing ponies. You see a similar rapid improvement since  because hes already building on a lot of preexisting knowledge and hard work.So I guess my point is for new artists to not get discouraged if you cant replicate such a rapid improvement as amazing artists like Tsitra and Atryl. You just need to have persistence and patience and be willing to keep going through the good and bad times.edit added examples,mylittlepony,cgl7wqf,58,t5_2s8bl

786142,0,t3_235au0,Okay completely honest answer here. My idea as to how some not all there are plenty not like this bronies came to be is that they were average people dealing with depression or bullying or something related. When these people watched MLP for the first time it made them smilelaugh. Or when a character got upset they sympathized with them and became more connected to the show. So they keep coming back to the show because it makes them happy. Why stop doing something that makes you smile? Note this is kind of how it worked for me. I was feeling insecure about myself and those who I considered my friends alienated me to a degree. MLP made me realize what a true friend is and made me happier as a result. ,mylittlepony,cgtmzty,2,t5_2s8bl

978757,0,t1_chfeifo,I actually addressed this point. Tirek specifically tells Discord are you sure about this? And he responds Definitely. Twilight Sparkle will choose her friends over her magic any day. So it was definitely his idea.And another thing I forgot to mention. For those who think that Discord wouldnt put all of Equestria in danger for nothing more than a joke keep in mind that when he was battling the mane six in season two he stole the elements of harmony and gave them back to the mane six just so he could laugh at them for not being able to use them. He could have easily won by just making them disappear into thin air but he instead decided to take the more roundabout risky route of defeating the mane six for fun. Theres no reason why he wouldnt do the same here deliberately going the long way around to give Twilight her purpose.And yeah I agree that he didnt expect Tirek to betray him. He was going to betray Tirek by handing the necklace over to Twilight after she chose her friends over Discord. For a moment he thought hed misjudged and lost. But what shocked him was that Twilight made Tirek free Discord as well as part of the deal despite all that hed done and thus his gift of the necklace was that much more sincere.,mylittlepony,chfjk8l,3,t5_2s8bl

995152,0,t1_chh8axa,gt All of what Lankygit saidI can not upvote that enough.    For someone using the word analysis so much he did very little analysing. It used to be different. I started following around the time of the where are all the stallions videos. During S he and Bronycurious were a breathe of fresh air people who appreciated the show and didnt just bitch and whine about the petty details for which some hated S.     But as time went on it devolved into merely stating their opinions thats not analysing. And the opinions became more and more superficial and arrogant this episode sucks but if I would have written it it would be like this and then it would be glorious. I found myself getting irritated more and more by their videos. Personally i shrugged it off and kept watching hoping for a gem once and a while. But then I saw people write comments like at first I really liked the episode but now that you explain it I can see its a bad episode and now I hate it too. They were actually poisoning the fan base. Unintentionally of course but poisoning nonetheless. They had great power over the minds of many people and with great power comes great responisbility and thats where they totally dropped the ball. If you like  of an episode dont make a video bitching about the  make one where you praise the episode  of the time that way things are more balanced and reflect your feelings better. Many very young people watch their videos highly impressionable children who swallow everything their celebrity says. It makes me wonder how many people lost their love for the show because senpai said it sucked.      It didnt help that both were obviously no longer interested in doing their thing but they were now financially dependent on it so they were forced to keep creating videos whch just fueled the viscous circle of bitterness.      I didnt want to give up on digi and tommy so I kept watching their videos but that last video about the season finale was just ... too much ughhh. His comments about the new castle were just so irritatingly silly. I thought about it for a while and ended up unsubscribing after having followed from from nearly day . It was a sad day but the way he was just pissing on the episode was beyond my tolerance level.,mylittlepony,chhemgl,0,t5_2s8bl

1001585,0,t1_chhnngc,Because Celestia has very little characterization at least up until the season  opener.  What little we do see of her in the earlier seasons is her being official but to offset that they also have her be mischievous. see A Bird in the Hoof where she messed with the Cakes who were keeping her teacup full and then later in the episode when she got all suspenseful about Filomena resurrecting even when Fluttershy was close to tears.  Also see Swarm of the Century when she acted as though she had no idea why the neighboring town was dealing with a parasprite infestation  Blowing that out of proportion or just extrapolating it leads to the Trollestia arrangement thats so common.,mylittlepony,chi4zez,3,t5_2s8bl

1009379,0,t1_chj0czx,ppseesyou Long post! Thats good though!The whole birth thing is more suited towards the previous Headcanon Corner on anatomy but it involves it so I wont stress you out on it. I agree with live birth though talons and beaks pose a bit of an issue.I cant say I really forsee griffon youngins having much trouble with flying mainly just due to their avian traits and notably larger than pegasi wingspanHm I dont see griffons using too much magic but its not too out of the ordinary in the land of Equestria for nonponies to use magic abilities. Also isnt magic a proven thing in Equestria?Food is a really interesting one in my opinion. I imagine theres civilized eating like with humans we dont usually just grab a pigeon out of the air and bite into its neck thrashing like a crocodile. I can imagine griffons setting up small farms or ranches for small things like fish rabbits or small birds like again pigeons to feed populaces. Id also see them as omnivorous but siding more towards meateating.Pride and honour seem to be a common theme in responses which is pretty neat that theres this immediate general consensus on the subject.The Europe thing kinda makes sense different people with different habits and cultures along with on the official map the Yonder To Griffons is east of the large EquestriaAmerican continent. The continents? that griffons derive from would be very interesting to explore and discuss.Ive usually been using names that are between  syllables often using the Gs but occasionally Js or other letters such as Ts to start them off. So similar to what you said for sure.I like to believe theyre a little more civilized than all being hunters and such but it definitely could be a thing for a large predatorial creature such as themselves. One of the customs I envision is that griffons are fiercely monogamous to which cheating or having affairs is an astonishing crime in their society. Itd also be so strong that a widow male or female wouldnt be back on the market so to speak with pride and honour fuelling this.,mylittlepony,chj0vjj,2,t5_2s8bl

1141256,0,t1_chxysx0,bjbored For me in IRL I am considered quite social within communities most people work their entire lives to get access to. But I like coming back to the brony community because it is just more positive than those other groups. Like listening to a silly happy pop song. Sure there are occasionally toxic individuals like in any other community but in general if I go to something brony related I can be pretty sure I will leave happier than when I arrived. I find it a little bizzare that people cant understand the appeal of a community focused around positivity. I would also note that the community has attracted some of the top digital creators. These days I only watch episodes so the fan fictions and parodies I love continue to make sense. ,mylittlepony,chy036f,2,t5_2s8bl
1145693,0,t3_278tv4,twipridePersonally I quite like it. The design is very similar to the Tree of Harmony which I find to be very appropriate since it seems to basically do what the tree of harmony did just in castle form. And I just think that overall it is really lovely to look at.sptwirightThe way I see it its kind of like a new Youtube or Facebook layout. People will complain about it for a while but given time everyone will get used to it and probably even prefer it. Heck so many people thought making Twilight an Alicorn was a bad idea at the time. But now that weve had a whole season of it I think most people would agree that it turned out pretty great in the end. sprarityannoyedAlso while I can totally understand not liking the new castle.

1213407,0,t1_ci637b5,Thank you for the detailed response.  This is precisely what I was looking for!Ill be fair I was thinking of Silver Quill much of the time while writing this post as a perfect example of someone whos too negative... but after going back and looking at his reviews again either I happened to only have watched his most negative reviews or my memory is playing serious confirmation bias tricks on me.  Either way Im glad to hear there are some people looking at the show from a more neutral perspective.  Both of those videos were excellent watches and Im incredibly glad you brought them to my attention.  I think they really hit the nail on the head as to what makes a good analysis good.  Nostalgia Critics video put my thoughts on this subject into far far better words than I managed to in my original post up there.  Ultimately there were only really two reasons I was considering doing this in the first place.  The first was because there seemed to me to be a general lack of positivity in the analysis community.  The second was because I find analysis incredibly entertaining and having a discussion about things I enjoy is one of my favorite pastimes... even if that discussion happens to be a monologue.  With the first reason completely invalid Id only be making these because I think itd be fun and I think thats the best way to approach an endeavor like this.  That said its great to get input from others who might be my audience because if the videos that I had fun making can give some other people happiness all the better!Im not sure that I have the most excellent or brilliant or new ideas but if I do end up making analysis videos theyll be focused on entertaining the viewer.  What I really like about Silver Quills videos is that he structures his videos in a way that they themselves are entertainment.  Analysis and critique are out there primarily to serve a social purpose of course but ultimately most people are coming to these analysis videos I think just to enjoy watching another video about ponies.  Regardless of whether you believe his analysis is spot on or completely off the mark you can laugh at Silver Quills videos and get something out of them.  And thats definitely a model Id be structuring my series off of.  Again thanks for taking the time to make a thoughtful reply!,mylittlepony,ci64kht,4,t5_2s8bl

1232044,0,t3_287ijt,Eh.  I would say its a small loud portion.  Ive been active in the community for years and never had an issue online or irl with misogyny.  Honestly the overall impression Ive gotten from my community friendscommissionersetc is one some thing closer to gender indifference if thats a thing.  Were all watching what is generally seen as a girls show.  A person who isnt caring about that and enjoying the show for what it is seems more likely to you know treat people in a similar way.  At least thats what Ive encountered.  Sure theres sexualizing and all that crap people like to harp on but come on.  Rule .  There is nothing not sexualized by someone in this world.  And if anyone claims the sexualization a female exclusive thing and men are making the female characters into objects I will laugh in their face.  As far as gender goes sexualization is a very equal opportunity thing in this fandom.Im sure they exist but Ive never met a raving misogynist brony and none of the big sites have a tendency to support misogynist sorts of things.  It seems like something someone might say who hasnt spent time with the community and just knows a lot of guys on the internet are involved in it.  ,mylittlepony,ci88071,5,t5_2s8bl

Good but no great.  Kinda hackneyed a little foalish ugh.But yeah.  Check out one or both of the episodes i mentioned then go ahead.EDIT  the reason I do this is because you get interested in a show usually by catching it in the middle of a seasonepisode.  you get drawn in by the characters trying to follow along.  Those two episodes are great for showing off each character and are fun to watch.  Then you have a lot of good will towards the series which you will spend on the first two episodes.

1604752,0,t1_cjhcrpp,ppgrump Well I was just being wary of spoilers. You might run into those.spHasbros lenience hasnt been constant. One of the biggest factors driving the shows popularity was that they made no effort to enforce copyright on the show since they only looked at the toys. So all the episodes were up on Youtube which let people find them easily at no cost to see what the fuss is about.Then in the middle of season  they started using contentID to take these down. So contentID did what it does best taking down videos that fall under fair use and causing antiHasbro drama.During season  they also sent a cease amp desist to Fighting is Magic after it had been developed for years and was going to be played at EVO which happened due to fans not the devs pushing it.

1773359,0,t3_2eszpx,Its always fun to read your reviews.As for your questions. When Read It and Weep first aired a lot of people drew the same connection. I have to say that episode even if this wasnt intended to allude to us directly it is still spot on for how it feels to be a closet brony.. Fun fact Hasbro are going to defictionalize and release the daring do books. They are written by G.M burrows who have been writing several tie in books for MLPFiM and even wrote an episode for season . . I dont see a contradiction. Discord simply took the wrong approach. He is crafty but not infallible Discord tried to turn fluttershy against her friends by telling her that they look down upon her and fluttershy being fluttershy did not fault them for that also she looks down on herself affirming all the bad things discord said her friends think about her.Than iron will enters the picture. Iron will did not set to corrupt fluttershy he offered her help. A help that she seeked on her own terms in an attempt to better herself.The episode might be compressed for time realistically the seminar would have needed more than a single session but the writers still need to tell the whole story in a single episode. Notice that fluttershy dont really internalize something deep form the seminar itself. She is just mechanically repeating techniques to force her will. This is not true assertiveness just an act. In a way iron will seminar was a sham He only thought fluttershy shortcuts. Only in the end when she confront iron will she learns what being assertive truly means.Edit a typos etc.,mylittlepony,ck2oqik,3,t5_2s8bl

That frustration as you are forced to lock up both doors your power rapidly draining as you still have hours to go. ... ... ... ... The lights shut off the doors slam open and for a moment you sit there in silence knowing that you are no longer alone. You look up and the time its AM but how close is it to ? Maybe if you can hold out just a little longer...A face lights up the door leading to the west hallway. It begins to blink as the Toreador March begins to play. Terror sweeps over you as you gaze into the face of your executioner his face lighting up in time with the music. As the song fades so do your hopes of seeing the light of day.Everything goes black as the song comes to an end. Seconds crawl by each a century in length.

Those closest to the deceased  grieving friends family are the ones that need support and if you want to be a considerate person you should give them that support. Now you have to ask yourself what do they want? If the grieving want this to be sombre I think it would be most considerate to wear sombre. Unless you know the deceased and the grieving very well or the wake specifically mentions please wear bright colours the default mood is sombre. You would be tempting fate if you did otherwise.Now if youre talking about your own funeral? Sure. You can put it in your will that everyone has to wear a pony shirt.,mylittlepony,ckfvxo1,4,t5_2s8bl

It started out in the human world only went to Equestria for a minute or two. Flash Sentry was kinda there and mildly useful. Arcs! Actual story arcs! And conflicts that dont get resolved  seconds later! It was great.spOne of the things I thought was missing most from the first movie was angst. Any story about high school should have a little angst even ones selling dolls to little girls. And we got plenty in this one. Sunset Shimmer was the real lead of this movie and it worked. spThe music of course was way more teen pop than actual rock but it definitely left more of an impression on me than the first movie. I was still hoping for more references and whatnot.spIt did well in the fan service department. Maud was great. louderI only wish someone on this sub hadnt spoiled itsp Way more Trixie than anyone would expect. Its too bad the CMC were barely in it though.spAs for negative points the movies biggest failing is way too much expository dialogue. Even considering this has to play to fiveyearolds it was excessive. So much time and flow was wasted reminding us what happened in the first movie and what the bad guys who really are just bad guys with no real character are doing.spThe best thing I can say is that I really want to see more Equestria Girls.

Instead we get If you dont get what you want act batshit crazy and do insane and possibly illegal things to get what you want and it will work if you manage to do juuust the right thing! Total. BS.The second issue I have is with the Equestria Girls movies. I actually kind of like them but you know what I dont like? The fact that only  female characters wear pants Celestia Luna the notaspopularDazzling and some random background character one time. What the heck? The majority of all my female friends wear pants and very rarely if ever wear skirts. In EG if youre female you MUST be showin off dem gams. Set a better example in your character design people!

2835938,0,t3_2sku6t,Hmm what do I see in MLP that makes me love it? Well besides the drinking games heh. EDIT This post just got really long. Oops. Wall of text time.I love animated works. Western cartoons anime Disney movies CGI works a la PixargoodDreamworks Adult cartoons Rick amp Morty Archer etc you name it. Ive actively followed maybe  live action TV shows in the last  years everything I watch is animated. I just find it to be a far more expressive and enjoyable medium.As somebody who almostexclusively watches cartoons I find MLP extremely interesting because of how well it celebrates the history of animation. Were kind of going through a paradigm shift here with a new style of cartoon emerging represented primarily by Adventure Time which I love. MLP is important to me because it represents the true essence of oldstyle cartoons. It is Looney Tunes and Disney and Powerpuff Girls and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dexters Lab and even some DBZ and Pokemon too. Theyre not even subtle about it either Pinkie Pie literally does an old Looney Tunes gag like every other episode. Theres nothing novel about MLP its just a wonderful combination of all the best elements of all these cartoons that came before it. You could name almost any episode and I could tell you a myriad of ways in which its directly inspired by previous works. Whats more it doesnt feel like a Frankenstein combination of all these old shows even though it really is.This is kind of a strange argument in favor of MLP and its one that I rarely hear but I think this is really what sets it apart from the rest of the pack for me. The characters and soundtrack and humor are all really solid the morals at the end of each episode are cheesy but kind of endearing and its just a good childrens cartoon overall. That extra little thing that sends it from good to great though is how strongly the history of animation oozes out of it. It feels instantly relatable and nostalgic to me because this is the type of stuff I grew up on. Every episode of Adventure Time is strange and exciting and weird every episode of MLP feels like home.,mylittlepony,cnqfxzx,2,t5_2s8bl

Im sure its viewed as a good stepping stone to the full thing though.Also I seem to recall you mentioning being from Europe if youre not familiar with Top Gun its a key influence on the vibe they were going for doing it with magical ponies is half of why I find the episode so amusing.,mylittlepony,cnrhe47,2,t5_2s8bl

All of those fears proved to be completely unfounded I got tons of requests for pictures because of my cosplay and I even came to the rescue of two Discord cosplayers being assaulted by an angry mob on Saturday.  Oh and the community guests were so fucking nice it absolutely blew my mind.

Whether its Doctor Who anime star trek sherlock etc. And while many of those are good I dont necessarily openly identify as a fan. Being a brony however is different. Although I dont volunteer the info at first Ill admit to liking it if someone asks me. Identifying as a brony adds to me and allows me to identify with others of similar interest. When I find a brony I can generally assume theyre nerdy in some way like me! So I like having that be a part of who I am. I like our community and I like what we try to do with it when our minds and hearts are in the right place! So Im proud to be a brony!That being said it is important to differentiate between identify and define. I identify as a brony but it does not define me. It makes up who I am. Im also a fan of those other fandoms. Im also a scientist a music player etc. All of those things I identify with?

3208785,0,t1_coukq1a,sbbookDepends on how you define inferior.sptakealetterThe Germans built tanks that could win battles superior armor and weapons with unmatchable maneuverability in the Panzer III and IV series. The allies built warwinning tanks. To replace a wheel on a Panzer all of the wheels had to be removed and a carefully manufactured part had to be procured. A broken Sherman wheel on the other hand could be replaced by removing only the broken part and replacing it with a massmanufactured piece already on standby. Small damages crippled German tanks in the long run as they were so difficult to repair. So while Allied tanks generally lost more in battles a good number of them could be reused afterwards while many of the lightly damaged German vehicles were inoperable for the rest of the war.sptwicrazyShut up I dont have an obsession!,mylittlepony,coul8h4,5,t5_2s8bl

Is it cleared with everyone on the show staff? McCarthy famously said that Flash Sentry wouldnt appear in season four until he suddenly did in the finale and she would go on to say that he was inserted in without her knowledge in the end.Like I said context is what matters.

3292291,0,t3_2xu18m,I made a post yesterday about being a brony but not wanting to tell ANYBODY.  Within minutes i received words of encouragement and laughs from all sorts of folks in the fandom.  these people poniesare the most kind and supportive of redditors.  I myself got into the show because of my daughter and this website called icanhazcheezburger.com ... im a  year old father divorced not for being a brony loland i have a  year old daughter.  I live in nebraska where anything not considered manly is basically very frowned upon.  I plan to soon attend conventions i watch the show and listen to the songs regularly.  The song put me in a great mood especially smile smile smile.   my ex doesnt watch the show.  My daughter has seen all of the episodes and movies and she loves the MLPFIM shirts and toys.  I have a secret collection of memorabilia in my office where no one is allowed but me.  It is my sanctuary.  The show itself can put you through a myriad of emotions... especially if you dont spend much time out of the house like me.  Ive laughed and even cried during the show.  but they have a good habit of always ending on a happy note.  This in turn puts you the viewer in a good mood and you can go and conquer the day.Anyway i hope my input was useful good luck with your writing you should give the show a try sometime    ,mylittlepony,cp3jqf8,1,t5_2s8bl

3308027,0,t1_cp59zkj,gt This subreddit is supposed to be an aggregate of high quality content not a place for artists to receive critique on their work.flutterfearI disagree with that sentiment since I think that critique discussions and community stuff all have their place in this subreddit especially since its meant to be a general subreddit centered around the show.spHowever its worth noting that this wont disrupt Reddits basic functionality as a content sorter. Inevitably because this subreddit isnt completely centered around critique and learning drawing skills the best content will find its way to the top.

Fits into the canon of both universes.Anthropology  A classic around here it comes from the early fandom pretty cheesy at times but an enjoyable read.Magic and Mayhem and ...Murder? Oh my...  A crossover with Psych plenty of funny moments and I think the author does a pretty decent job of capturing Shawns personality.A Voice Among the Strangers  A girl finds herself flung into Equestria and her first contact goes about as horribly as possible. Also some really interesting plotlines with the changelings in here.

Show includes something the fandom doesnt like? Shit writers need to be fired. Something from the show is made into a toy? Corporate meddling.  Significant character development?

3368655,0,t1_cpbtkoz,gtGive others the benefit of the doubt when commenting. Tone is tough to convey via text.Ill admit uSleethoof was making a joke but heshe was far from making light of something as traumatic as rape. Not wanting to talk about something doesnt mean it should be avoided at all costs. This thread has provided a new line of discussion Ive not seen before.Personally Id never thought about the possibility that Shining was indeed raped by Chrysalis.As a thinking feeling adult I was intrigued by the line of thought and saddened by the very real possibility. Shining Armor was completely under Chrysalis mental control. He would do anything at her command. In the context of a kids show I doubt it would even be canon that he was molested in any way but thinking about it from a logical standpoint its a clear possibility.Even if he wasnt physically harmed his mind the part of him that he considers himself was under anothers control. That is a by far worse fate in my opinion. These kinds of issues may not be very good for the purview of the show but are exactly the kind of thing those of us outside the domain of the show and also the age range can talk through and debate.Were all adults here. As long as the discussion remains clean civil and relevant to the sub then it should never be off limits. ,mylittlepony,cpc9306,1,t5_2s8bl

3518793,0,t1_cptcxsl,I do agree that they really shouldnt do romance in the show UNLESS if the point is to show that Twilight cant be in a romantic relationship. If she is being built up to take Celestias place one day or something then showing her denying her own personal feelings for the good of the realm would be some solid characterization. However I do have to disagree that hes supposedly received a fair shot. Weve only ever seen the version of him thats a high school stereotype and not the version that actually matters. Hes had a cameo here and there but thats not giving him a chance. Thats the writers refusing to do anything with him and hurting their own show because of it. Apparently those cameos were added in upon request assuming it was by Hasbro or whoever and if thats the case then its clear that Flash isnt something that is just going to go away. The writers need to work with it develop it make him into someone we want Twilight to be with. If Hasbro is going to force the issue then they have to make lemonade out of the situation. Any writer worth their salt could do it. This is all of course assuming that the writers dont already have a plan in place to screw with our expectations and introduce him as a completely different character to his human counterpart. I like to believe that they listen to the fans heard the complaints and have something in the works. My moneys on that horse.,mylittlepony,cptda3v,3,t5_2s8bl

Of course this could only lead to disgust confusion anger hatred... desire to watch the show. In about  weeks or so I had reached the middleend of season . At this point I began to watch less and less and by around my th birthday on May  I had stopped. I continued to appreciate the show I had just moved away from it for some reason. Throughout the busy summer I was often away and had little chance to join the fandom again. In September I entered the th grade which has gone fine so far. Ive continued being part of the track team and have done well enough in triple jump that I hope to be able to compete at the state level by my senior year. My personal best is  which I set . weeks ago at the first meet of the outdoor season.Moving back in time a bit to around November I found this subreddit. I watched all the remaining episodes in about  weeks but unlike before my interest in MLP has stayed strong mainly due to this sub and due to my discovery of fanfiction. ,mylittlepony,cpz58ll,5,t5_2s8bl

3847498,0,t1_cqus1pm,Firstly thank you for the long and considered reply  I really appreciate it. If I seem to throw that word around too easily here its because for me this sub has a  track record of being incredibly helpful patient and welcoming and this thread has continued that Ive not been part of such an online community before. Having mainly been involved with sports and music forums this is a breath of fresh air and well I appreciate it!Thanks for the advice too. I want to give a proper response here to reflect the time you took to write to me in the first place so apologies if it comes out really long again...!I totally take on board what youre saying but Im not sure how it would work with regard to the blog or rather the reasons Im doing the blog in the first place.When I first decided to write about MLP I did originally consider doing a series of essays on individual topics essentially reasons I apparently now love MLP part  SNAPPY TITLE or something but it felt kind of artificial compared to going episodebyepisode because I wanted the story to be about me and my family discovering the show what we thought at the time and what we think now.Which is obviously a niche topic in itself because all potential readers are clearly going to be less interested in the story of me and my family since they arent well me.Anyway the storytelling of MLP is indeed the aspect that interests me most in terms of finding things to discuss but a topic based approach doesnt really work for me e.g. a shorter but more indepth Pinkie Pie and the Rules of Reality  thoughts as of se thing rather I prefer to add to it incrementally follow threads in and out of episodes rather than trying to tackle them all in one go the idea in my head! is that bits of each essay would tie in with bits of other essays when something happens in that particular episode to advance that particular topic a bit further though obviously sticking to a chronological model I can only really link arguments backwards not forwards.  Does that make any kind of sense?And if Im being totally honest and this is not meant as simple flattery... if I did try and do a topicbytopic MLP Art of the Story blog instead I feel youre already doing it better than I could anyway  I dont want it to just be a pale copy of yours!The excessive length thing is a problem... Honestly I never thought any of these would end up anywhere near as long as they are. I think that because in my day job I spend a lot of time distilling arguments down to their essence and trimming unnecessary fat from statements etc. its really liberating to just be able to write and write with no limits and Ive loved doing them so far. I also think that because in my day job I have to read and digest word slabs of text I maybe underestimate how much of a pain in the arse that is to read for people who arent either being paid to do so or who didnt write it in the first place. So what I was thinking of doing is a twopart thing. First I was going to put a contents section on each megaessay with descriptive links to each subsection. Second and this is probably more important producing a much shorter punchier version of each of these megaessays. Itd be almost a capsule version really just setting out some of my reactions my favourite moments and why what I thought worked well noting storytelling topicsobservations in skeleton form rather than the halfway house Ive got at the moment where an interestic topic comes up and I sort of get into it before moving on to the next scene to be picked up again and advanced the next time it crops up and aiming to keep them below  words while still linking back to the relevant sections of the megaessays for those inclined to read it all.  The Shorter Ponywatching.All of this is probably Reddit poison but like I said Im not really so very bothered by that as long as Im not bothering others in turn! I was just a bit baffled that the first one did quite well the second one less so the third one less than that etc. rather than them all dying on their backsides votewise. I also didnt realise Reddit has a long tail  I even made a ha nobody can see this joke because I thought if a post disappeared off the front couple of pages of hot it was lost to history but apparently not!rpriceless A little glass of water please...,mylittlepony,cquukh9,2,t5_2s8bl

3968825,0,t3_35x77m,fluttershh Alright heres something I want to talk about. There seems to be a growing number of posts being sexualized in the comments when they probably shouldnt be.Im going to be putting some comments in the spotlight and I apologize for that I dont want any users to be put in the spotlight partly because this is also directed at the people who upvote such comments so I wont be directly linking to the comments or submissions just quoting them.spcelestiawut One example is this piece of art posted the other day. As far as I can see everything about this indicates it was going for elegance and beauty. Fancy stuff. But the comments had more than one instance of users using wingboner emotes from BPM. Is this the right place to talk about how a pony in a gown is getting you like sprung?spabwut But arguably worse were the comments on this image One comment was ...Dont mind me Im just here to see where this leads. You know... for science. Another was a manspike.I mean these are children in elementary school. Why exactly is anyone so interested to see what happens between two tenyearolds? Why is that something you want to see? And its not even intentionally suggestive!spfluttershy Like I said these comments were upvoted. Well some of them. The manspike was downvoted at least. But the for science comment got above twenty points though to be fair it did have a bit of other content and one of the wingboner comments was the top comment for that submission at the time. So clearly the people who made those comments arent exactly alone which is why I dont want to single them out as if nothing else they were clearly just successfully playing to an audience. So what I want to figure out is whats the motivation behind those kinds of comments? And whats the motivation behind upvoting them?Im not trying to be judgmental with rhetorical questions. Im asking because Im genuinely confused over whether its a joke Im just not getting or something more sincere. Its possible everyones just making jokes based on how ridiculous it is to get excited about that stuff and its just lost on me because by this point I know there are lots of people who do get excited about that stuff foalcon is a thing and so it just looks sincere to me.spajfrown Mostly Id just like to reemphasize that we should try to stay away from that sort of thing on this subreddit. If an image has little call to be sexualized try to minimize the sexualization in the comments. Like yeah images that are very obviously shipping adult characters or making slightly risqu jokes its at least more understandable. But remember that this subreddit caters to a lot of people who are here because its clean and free of excessive sexiness. It starts to feel like you cant escape that stuff if even a pony in a ball gown brings out the boyoyoyoyoyoiiiinng comments.sptwismile Im interested in feedback though. What do people think? I particularly want to hear from the people that make those comments or upvote them. I realize its a bit awkward to ask people to step forward about it though. Throwaways are welcomed if youre uncomfortable. I also have this straw poll to more easily leave anonymous feedback. Its worded towards the people who make the comments if you upvoted those comments just pick whatever you interpreted the comment as that it warranted an upvote. If you downvote that stuff this poll is not for you.sptwibeam Discuss!,mylittlepony,cr8ohc0,55,t5_2s8bl

It was the only time she redeemed herself but its enough to get the fandom going. To be honest she does strike me as a follower wholl just go along with whatever Diamond Tiara is suggesting. Even in this comic she warmed up to the detective but in the end still chose her best friend.This is something a lot of parents are worried about in real life their kids becoming friend with someone whos just a terrible influence.

4042863,0,t1_crgjy1h,Stop with the condescending tone please. There was no acting completely against anyones character in this comic. Rainbows logic was justified for her and that is enough for that. She isnt always a paragon of reason anyway you know. Plus she has a rivalry going with AJ. AJ took it way too personally while Rainbow doesnt take the entire conflict too seriously. Entirely in character. You think too much of Rainbow if you believe her being reasonable enough to be sick of them fighting meaning being more reasonable than AJ who is usually the voice of reason is something realistic to happen. Plus Fluttershy would not be actively participating in the conflict if she was on Raritys side and it wouldnt be a balanced situation like it is right now when both sides have loyal supporters from the characters we know AJs family and Rainbow.And I dont think you understand characters as well as you think if you believe Rainbow in Tanks was acting all selflessly and loyally. She was being extremely selfish and sabotaging tons of ponies work for HERSELF. She knew deep down that Tank needed to hibernate but rather than do what was right for her pet she decided to deny the truth to herself and go to extreme lengths just so she would not have to be upset over having one less creature to entertain her during winter. But it isnt actually that out of character for her because she often acts selfishly heck she still had to learn lessons about staying loyal to her friends in season freaking four rainbow falls trade ya etc. Im not saying it was super OOC Im saying it was unreasonable and that Rainbows actions in the comic are not any less reasonable and any more OOC.,mylittlepony,crh48hx,-1,t5_2s8bl

4103938,0,t3_37lth7,twibeam Whee! More Ponywatching! Heres my commentary of the commentary... spgt episodes in completely the wrong order ... continuity inconsistencies ... it actually being down to the laziness of the DVD compilers fingerpainting all over Lauren Fausts big picture.Well while Faust did have a vision and the some of the episodes clearly do have an order to them as far as I know the writing process still isnt all that serial and what we like to attach as clear character growth when it fits might be just random coincidences in ordering.You said it yourself actually. Look Before You Sleep is a great continuation to getting to know the characters especially Twilight after the pilot. If this was the actual order they were aired in and then a silly DVD production moved the Look episode to the eight place wed be annoyed at someone meddling with the vision the writers had...We dont know how well planned the order really is. I gather not that much but yes certain introductions and developments need to be in order to make proper sense. Though admittedly Im a bit grumpy about continuity.Then again no matter how relevant to the continuity or not I personally hate it when releases mess with the original order. Unless they happened to be messed up in the first place or if the reordering is in fact very well considered to make the story more effective And as you mention the DVD reordering you had is really wacky and downright insulting with the messed up character intros so yeah theres not excusing that.gt This simply isnt a very good idea for an episode. ... the conflation is done poorly ... wrong direction from the getgo ... storytelling mistakes etc etcI agree.Basically the episode seems to be driven by a very contrived plot that even overrides characterizations to serve its needs. Its not terrible but its just not really what draws me into Friendship is Magic at all.gt Its possible that this storyline came about as a result of corporate pressure from Hasbro wanting an adorable brave little owl with antiquated name toy to be their nerdy magicians companionI wouldnt go that far even though its an interesting theory. But I think Twilight needed a pet because they all have to have pets apparently and the writers thought that wouldnt it be fun if it was an owl with antiquated name. Still the whole show is an example of how to do constrained writing well so that shouldnt be any reason to fail really.I think sometimes people just fail. Its a risk when being creative and wanting to try things without a bulletproof preconceived fixed format. It can yield excellent results but the price is the occasional failure.gt the meteor shower itself isnt exactly the stunning spectacle all the characters make it out to be ... but it doesnt really mattertwisad Yes it does. I really wanted to see the great meteor shower everyone was so excited about. spgt She appears to be writing a report about comets ... its entirely possible she has other nonfriendship related studies to complete and this is more about the acquisition of knowledge. Or maybe Im overthinking this.Nope I dont think you are overthinking. I always expected her to have a range of magic science space and all such related studies going on perhaps not directly assigned by Celestia the sort that a proper mentorpupil academic relationship would have. Ive been studying the movement of blah blah in relation to blah and Im thinking that... Yes that sounds correct you should write me a comprehensive report about your findings.gt I suspect most bronies tired as quickly as we did of the hoo business something the episode hasnt finished with just yet. But hey maybe Im wrong disapproveowl Nah. The hoo was stupid after even one repetition. I guess they were going for the intentionally overblown joke thing there but it didnt really work like that either. spHooever Owlowiscious is ok enough. Hes an owl after all so hes got that going for him. Hoo knows maybe hell develop further in the ongoing season .ppboring Its such a hoot making bad puns isnt it. spgt But heres where our story really takes off because tomorrow is the first day of  and Im about to go full brony.

4205184,0,t3_390z97,Its simply the latest in a long list of things that people demonize simply because they do not understand it. Comic book nerds used to be viewed as fat greasy loners and sometimes till are but that stigma has mostly waned and being a fan of comic books is now seen as a normal thing.Anime has a similar stigma and there are a lot of people who fiercely hate anime. Even MMO players got quite a bit of hate for awhile.MLP I think is a little unique for two reasons. First it is something that is rather hard for people outside the fandom to understand not just because its girly but because MLP as a TV series has a history of being exceptionally low quality.The second reason is that I feel this is one of the first big stigmas to occur in the age of social media. Social media has a tendency to make all manner of social phenomenon happen much much bigger and much much faster. Hence why the brony fandom and hate exploded so quickly but also why the hate died so quickly. The fact that the fandom has more or less outlived this period of being a weird thing is a testament to the shows continuing quality.This become a little ranty and I am not a sociologist. I am not an expert in these matter in any way shape or form this is simply what Ive seen and how Ive personally pieced it together.

On the other hand I dont feel bad for FPH. At all. When you literally have the word hate in your subreddit title it stands to reason that your userbase is full of assholes which FPH undoubtedly was. And while I wasnt particularly surprised this happened the fact that too many people on reddit turned the mods at FPH into some kind of martyrs makes me a lot more uncomfortable than the prospect of reddit banning a few subs. ,mylittlepony,cs3woeu,4,t5_2s8bl

4360094,0,t1_csgxv2g,I think because Alicorn Twilight like Cadance and like the Crystal Castle was forced by Hasbro merchandising but outside of stuff like that the staff writes the show. Notice we havent gotten any rainbow power references at all yet this season and I kinda doubt well see any unless its badly shoehorned in. So big things happen but the staff seems to work around it and avoid completely changing what made the show work in the first place. Faust left a lot of pretty competent people in charge and Im sure many of them still share her vision as much as is possible within the constraints Hasbro sets.Thats why the show didnt change to All Pretty Pink Princess All The Time because all the staff got was Make Twilight an Alicorn and they work around it and run with it from there.,mylittlepony,csh46wm,2,t5_2s8bl

Of course every word has a different meaning for every person. You know in most countries they have one word for house. In english we have house hovel abode residence hut and mansion. I probably missed some. But theoretically those all come from the same roots of different languages. So we differentiated them to mean different levels of house based seemingly on how famcy they are.

4453609,0,t3_3c440m,What a sweet episode! This is exactly how you write an episode about friendship!I absolutely loved the callbacks to the first episode! From Twilights old home right down to the girls Twilight used to interact with before she moved to Ponyville. Heck they even showed entire flashbacks of various scenes of the first episode! What I really loved is how got a loose end tied up in regards to what happened to them when Twilight left. We even got a reveal of what the present Spike was going to give to Moondancer was going to be! Speaking of the girls themselves I absolutely loved the character and the fact that they formed their own group similar to the Mane .Then theres Moondancer herself... Oh did I feel so bad for her. It was hard to see her absolutely crushed when Twilight didnt show up to her party and how she turned into what Twilight used to be obsessed with studying and not caring about having any friends at all.One other thing about Twilight I really love the portrayal of her role as The Princess of Friendship here by making an episode to patch things up and going out of her away to help someone who turned into how she used to be even bringing in the support of one of her friends to help show what friendship means. A quick side note by the way I loved Pinkies helicopter tail a la Miles Tails Prower.One last thing I want to mention is how much I loved Spike in this episode! This is exactly how I want to see him a great support character hanging with Twilight!I have to tip my hat to M.A. Larson for a very sweet episode that tied up some loose ends and even threw in a few surprises too. This is definitely one of my favorite episodes of Season  so far!,mylittlepony,css27ln,1,t5_2s8bl

That is a bit of speculation though.EDIT It was also mentioned on the directors twitter to ask the network why it was being delayed.

I think the only way to keep the list as unbiased as possible is to try to establish some metrics that things must meet to be included. For example over  million views for animations PMVs andor music.This obviously wouldnt be perfect and it would knock Anthropology of the list   but it would be better than nothing.Perhaps a better way to do it would be by a poll. Just ask people to mark which things they feel should be included and only pick the ones with a  or higher approval rate.

5171594,0,t3_3lkk67,My comments on this epidose I think its at least in my top  favorite episodes so far.  Well written with good pace and introduction of a new wrinkle on Rarity.   Loved the Noir theme.  Not too overbearing nor forced.  Just a dash of it mixed with the moments where Rarity is forced back into reality by Dash.  It really felt like Rarity was living out a fantasy of being her favorite character. I like how it wasnt so completely obvious who the villain was.  Yes he was the only one with motivation but that doesnt mean anything without proof. Negatives  The guards seemed very inept I know common refrain.  Why did the Wonderbolts not start their own investigation?  Understanding its a kids show I dont really mind those so much.Overall great episode.

You play these cards to disrupt your opponent and prevent them from confronting a problem but then they beat the troublemaker and gain just as many points than if theyd been able to confront instead. Ive only really played with theme decks so far though so maybe there are better rarer troublemakers that dont just bite the dust so easily...I dont think anyone liked that.  The developers have come around on how stupid this mechanic is too.  The VAST majority of standard troublemakers printed in Absolute Discord and Equestrian Odysseys now have a bonus of zero.Also deckbuilding is greatly simplified with Equestrian Odysseys.

5269232,0,t1_cvl2nsw,Your piece while moving fails to account for the true masses the lowest common denominator as they say. I would posit the majority of televisionmovie viewers across many genres watch simply for the resolution of a plot. We decry the simplification of stories and upplaying of special effects but if we wanted lowsensory media to consume we would listen to radio. Critical thought is reduced into easy sides and points. Even moral ambiguity is simple to construct. People are creatures of emotion it is visciously easy to draw someone in. Only our senses of disbelief keep us in check and even then those are easily fooled enough. Of course I could be completely wrong. My Little Pony is quite literally the only syndicated television I watch its simply not a medium of entertainment that appeals to me.I dont think that people dismiss childrens entertainment solely because its simple. Teenagetargeted entertainment draws plenty enough adult fans and plenty of that is simple at least by some measure. I think that people dismiss childrens entertainment  simply as a function of maturity. As we age we change. The subject matter we consume changes and our tastes change with it.I also think you confuse childrens entertainment with family entertainment and teenage entertainment. I would not classify Pixar Minecraft or Avatar the bender series not the blue aliens right? as childrens entertainment. Theyre all quite suitable for children but theyre not pure childrens entertainment not on the scale of Special Agent Oso or My Little Pony. My Little Pony might be a little more refined but it is still byandlarge true childrens entertainment.,mylittlepony,cvl7c16,5,t5_2s8bl

Im surprised you dont have more subscribers.On the topic of the video you have a lot of good points and I also didnt really like the way the story turned out in the end. There wasnt even a real mystery seeing as we are introduced to a completely new character who has a very selfish motive for framing Dash and that is so he can keep his record. I would have been happier if it had turned out that Spitfire herself had written the note in order to get out of the performance the reasons could be many and Rainbow had just accidentally been framed based on circumstantial evidence. It would have made for a more interesting story and a great twist because we could all assume it was Wind Rider based on his motive and then be baffled by his innocence. Maybe he could even have helped clear Rainbows name after being falsely accused himself.But nah we need another oneoff villain to add to the roster so now we have yet another Wonderbolt bully to add to the pile.,mylittlepony,cvpkua9,1,t5_2s8bl

Yeah theyre good at other things and they have their individual talents but singingbuildingscootering arent what their characters have been built up to pursue or where their main interests lie. Theyre interested in cutie marks what cutie marks mean to them and what other ponies cutie marks mean. They always have been. Sure I could have seen Appleblooms cutie mark being something dealing with construction or engineering but then she would have been growing out of what her primary interest has been for the past five seasons.

I think I recall reading a post from Lauren Faust on her deviantart to that effect.Having said that theyve said elsewhere that what is aired on the show is their final answer on whats canon and anything that hasnt aired is subject to change. It does seem like at this point theyve subtly introduced that idea into the show though so that its pretty much canon even if not stated outright.The last time it was alluded to was the two shooting stars in Apple Family Reunion which a storyboard artist confirmed were an allusion to the dead parents.,mylittlepony,cvvnia3,1,t5_2s8bl

I agree she should definitely have the hoof holding on the headphones and the glasses but make sure you put a wire from the headphones to the deck.

The vast majority of Bronies genuinely try and be nice people to both fans and nonfans alike which really does hammer in how the show can change people for the better. This clip from the documentary World of Weird is a prime example. When I saw this on TV it genuinely made my night knowing that the many people watching the documentary not only found out about the fandom but got their first impressions in a positive way rather than something like CollegeHumors My Little Brony.

Earth ponies typically possess more raw physical power than other pony breeds granting them greater strength and stamina compared to pegasi and unicorns. Although they possess no active magic it can be said that they all harbour a certain level of latent magic which gives them an affinity with the earth and nature. Typically looked down upon by pegasi and unicorns earth ponies have a history of being the lower class of Equestrian society. Modern earth ponies stand on more or less equal social footing with other pony breeds but prefer to reside away from more upper class locations such as Canterlot. Earth ponies are the most common breed of pony and can be found in considerable numbers almost anywhere in Equestria. gtBuffaloNative to the desert wilds buffalo are an indigenous species that operates out of tribes. Buffalo are one of the most physically powerful creatures in Equestria capable of charging through built up structures with ease. Together a stampede of buffalo can destroy an entire village. Outside of their  physical prowess buffalo are strongly spiritual in nature. They respect tradition highly and their rituals are among their most sacred possessions. Preferring to live just in the company of their tribes Buffalo are hard to interact with and rarely seen outside of their home regions. Modern buffalo have begun branching out and forming partnerships with some pony societies but largescale alliances are yet unformed.gtZebrasNative to the hottest regions in Equestria zebra are almost unknown throughout most of the world. Although they do not wield magic in the traditional sense most commonly seen in unicorns zebras have a long history of alchemy and voodoo. These skills often create a negative and untrustworthy perception in other pony societies compounded only further by the limited interaction zebras have outside of their homeland. Zebras are typically solitary creatures and possess a very strong affinity with nature even more so than earth ponies. Zebras can sometimes be seen acting as spiritual mentors preferring to help others by helping them help themselves. gtYakYak live in the remote frozen mountains of Yakyakistan. Similar to buffalo these creatures are renowned for their size and sheer brute strength. Living in such a perpetually hostile environment has bred the yak into an extremely hardy and uncompromising society. More than any other society in Equestria yak are dedicated to the traditions of their homeland. Their temper and volatile mood swings are also legendary across Equestria. Modern yak have entered into alliances with some pony societies but their homeland remains largely untravelled by outsiders.  ,mylittlepony,cw5nycd,2,t5_2s8bl

To explain it with an analogy is your greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather relevant to you or your daily life? Most people would say no. Sure without him you wouldnt exist but he has zero impact on your life.    Likewise without Lauren there would be no Twilight etc or rather they would be different Hasbro would have given someone else the job dont forget that G was created on Hasbros initiative not Laurens. Lauren contacted Hasbro for another project but got hired for MLP but she no longer has any influence on the current stories or developments.

5498156,0,t1_cwealcz,It seems to me Jerry Peet and in this video Joshscorcher are doing the same thing Theyre latching on to an interpretation that fits the message they want to say and dont do a step back to counter their own interpretation on it. They take other possible points of view out only to mock or attack them not to attack their own view on it. That makes their analysis very onesided and not well thoughtout.They feel like they want to make a point. Then they dig up everything that matches that point. Thats not how you find truth.I guess it could work as a discussion starter but it isnt presented as such. It would also be the style of adversarialitybased discussion I dislike. And even though not Peet his style is still aggressive and matteroffactly in a way thats not constructive.He does admit in the ending that he has also learnt to understand the other side of the issue. Yet he certainly didnt include it in his analysis. That would point towards this being only one point in a dialogue. In that case it cant be judged alone and should only be seen in context of the other points of view. I have to admit though even in that case I still dislike the style of adversarial dialogue that only attempts to present one argument without trying to point out its flaws.,mylittlepony,cwefwg8,3,t5_2s8bl

5615720,0,t3_3s1fzu,ajfrown Sounds like a time to break out that quote MLP fans always love to use anyway from C.S. LewisspCritics who treat adult as a term of approval instead of as a merely descriptive term cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up to admire the grown up because it is grown up to blush at the suspicion of being childish these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are in moderation healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.,mylittlepony,cwt6nbj,15,t5_2s8bl

5657430,0,t1_cwyc4nq,gt How long do you think it would take for them to figure it out? Not sure but the first thing I thought when I imagined the situation was What is even the point of choosing? Were all gonna die anyway except for one assuming the last one gets to survive. Why are we trusting these psychopaths to even let the last person go anyway?Basically I think if I were in the scenario once I knew the rules Id think Theres also option C They do as they did in the ship experiment in The Dark Knight and with everyone or almost everyone refusing to choose to vote someone dead or most failing to make a decision by the  minute mark. Those who do vote are themselves an easy choice of who to vote off in the next round making ponies less willing to vote. After a few rounds of this there are volunteers to be voted off or they agree to vote the eldest members of the group off. AJ would probably volunteer to give her friends and family a chance to survive. Except once you start thinking of the game altruistically Which friend or family member can I protect as opposed to How can I save myself I think the game starts seeming kind of pointless. How long does this go on? Whats the point of voting someone off when were just gonna vote for someone else in  minutes? And another  minutes after that? It becomes really clear there can only be one survivor and the outcome of one round means pretty much nothing.,mylittlepony,cwycy06,2,t5_2s8bl

This is a different world the sun doesnt actually need to have a mass.Conservation of momentum can be solved by assuming the world or some magical thingy is an anchor for all magical acceleration.Alternatively one could assume that magic simply magnifies near impossible probabilities of quantum mechanics. Its already possible afaik take this with a grain of salt for things to randomly jump into the air assuming the world randomly accelerates downward. Its simply so incredibly unlikely to happen that it is less likely to happen over the entire age of the universe than it is for you to win each jackpot of all lotteries that you can buy easily simultaneously on the first try. Therefore magic could change those probabilities without breaking any other physical laws.Or maybe I misunderstood quantum mechanics again and am blathering nonsense.

And not just because Im  hour away from stuffing myself silly.sptwiprideI dont know if Im just being sappy because of the holiday feelings and being around family but I think todays the day Im going to share some of my favorite Shipfics. Dont worry if RomanceShipping isnt your thing I have one excellent story to start off thats for darn near everybody.sptakealetterPost Nuptials Is a fic that a measly Slife of Life tag cannot do justice. This fic is everything I wanted out of the aftermath of A Royal Canterlot Wedding that we never got to see inshow. Truly a spectacular offering.spcadencesmileOne other little disclaimer... I dont really read a whole heck of a lot of Romance that isnt FF. Sorry there just arent that many male characters in MLP and so there arent a large number of authors writing them well in Romance.Alright thats done full steam ahead for Shipsville!sprdsmileLet me start off with a feel trip on the S.S. TwiDash The Best Is Yet to Come This wonderful fic pretends that the show ended after Season  and imagines what the girls lives would be like from there.spraritydawwIn a little RariJack story called Of Apples and Diamonds Rarity stops pining after a Prince and dreams that the one for her may in fact be her Knight in shining armor. shiningpridein No relation.spcelestiamadNow I cant actually link my very favorite TwiLestia fic because I think it straddles the line of propriety for Rule  but I can link Ascent Not only a great introduction to TwiLestia with most of the usual problems you get used to seeing but excellent characterization for pretty much every single member of the cast that make any solutions all the more believable. If youre curious what my favorite TwiLestia is and dont mind reading tastefully written ponies making out and references to sex outside of the story then just PM mesprdhuhOkay two more and youre just going to have to bear with me on this one. Framed is an incredibly cute RariDash... yes I said RariDash. IT WORKS OKAY!

Although they could have Human Sunset somehow end up in Equestria and shed essentially be a whole fresh character that wouldnt need any backstory to be mentioned.Although my dream would still be them just joining the lines and screw the haters I realize it would be very awkward to have all the baggage from the movies suddenly be dumped into the shows main continuity even for a twoparter.

5804339,0,t3_3ulr0m,joy This episode was pretty incredible. Top of the line storytelling that started fast and good and never stopped. And thats not even counting the subject matter. Man some of these scenes no one would have believed wasnt fanfiction if we hadnt all watched it live. We learned that if Friendship hadnt Deus Ex Machinad everything all neat and tidy in all the previous episodes then the shows universe wouldve gone dystopian and not a Grated andyounger childrens show dystopia either. Fighting wars getting physically disfigured flipping to the evil side implied fatalities oh and an Equestria apparently completely devoid of all life. Fucking WOW.sptwipbbtExcept for the ending. This one I think missed hard. And yeah I know other episodes have swung and missed but this was more painful because the whole twoparter built up so wonderfully and the ending didnt match it at all. When it became clear that there were going to be multiple dystopian universes we were going to visit before resolution of the story I was excited because for once I couldnt even come up with a hypothesis of how this was going to resolve. Clearly Twilight wasnt able to do any action on her part to fix things. The only other possibilities were Starlight convinces herself to fix things through an internal conflict resolution or Twilight was going to have to get one of the dystopian villains to help her defeat Starlight whether through reconversion nightmare night or deception.And despite how awesome either of those would have been I didnt see how these could possibly relate to the shows continued theme of a moral on what makes a good friendship solves literally any conflict we decide to show you. The internal conflict resolution is just thatinternal and thus doesnt have anything to do with friendship to a second person and bringing in a villain either rehashes something already done before or resorts to outright trickery which definitely isnt in line with the show despite how well it could have worked as an interesting story.But then it suddenly became clear to me during Starlights flashback. She got all jealous and bitter at her friend who got their cutie mark before hers. She blamed the cutie mark on distancing and eventually ending their friendship when really it was herself alone that ended the friendship because her ego couldnt deal with her friends success gracefully. This is a great lesson that Ive seen even adults miss and needlessly end friendships while blaming it on the other person. Starlight really needed to use time travel to give herself another chance to do this friendship right rather than become the monster she was who held a grudge against literally every postadolescent character in the shows universe. And she was totally going to realize she was a monster she did not want to be when they went exploring that shown dystopian Equestria and found herself facetoface with the undefeated villain of this particular universeherself.twirageBut no lets just solve it with an emotional breakdown providing the necessary vulnerability for a few lines of Twilight dialogue to fix everything and set her on the straight and narrow for the first time since she was a kid. Not only was that resolution lame it came at the expense of what could have been in my opinion one of the more complicated and besttold friendship lessons to date. So what if theres a possibility of the Mane ? Starlight didnt really learn a satisfying lesson from her past she certainly didnt try making amends to that particular friend either in the past or present. And all the time travel and multiple dystopian timelines despite being very awesome never served a function in Starlights resolution. Disappointing. Seahawks Superbowl  level of disappointing.But much like watching Superbowl  as a Seahawks fan the first  was amazing to watch and Ill not let the very ending mar all the things that built up to the end that were very much worth watching and remembering.,mylittlepony,cxgkzul,3,t5_2s8bl

6195087,0,t1_cytp56o,Your first paragraph reminds me of a perspective that was brought up by AntonyC in AnYPonys crossover review of FOE which I thought was interestinggt I think the disconnect between that familiar contempt we feel for our own species and the love we have for innocent animals gives us an interesting vantage point from which to view such a story with its grimness despair and sexual confusion. Lo when its given life by a cast of adorable ponies who are innately impossible to dismiss with the same disappointment one feels for ones own kindIt reminds me of my reaction to the raiders in the story skepticism almost to the point of making fun of the idea. A spread out demographic of nonisolated ponies who were not only Ed GeinLeatherface levels of depraved but made a point to desecrate everything around them. The raiders in Fluttershys cottage shat on and set fire to the bed in their shelter and poisoned the land around them. I like to think I wouldve been skeptical of such characters were they human but possibly not as much. To what degree did their species make me demand a better explanation for depravity than theyre evil? Made me not accept theyre bad as a sufficient motive?In one of the last chapters the raiders are explained as products of the moral strain of the wasteland itself ponies whove simply given up completely. This is supported in the book when raiders are given civilization when their hired by Gawdina as mercenary when theyre living in New Appleloosa. Theres an ironic scene where a pony with some kind of mutilated body part for a cutie mark pins down an enclave soldier holds a gun to her head and doesnt shoot her. Its when the first Sonic Radboom clears the clouds and the whole town is for the first time seeing the sun. Its a moment where even a raider decided that no this was not a time for killing. And than he got killed by the enclave soldier the tragic irony being that one moment where the first time we see a raider show mercy and some value for life that mercy gets them killed.I like to imagine that the excessive levels of desecration exhibited by the raiders the childish painting of swear words everywhere the decorations of viscera that should logically be providing unlivable bug infestations to any raider hangout is for two reasons.  Resentment. The Ponyville bridge and the stairs in Twilights house are decorated with hearts the Ponyville buildings are finally out of place for being colored like a childrens playset all brutal reminders how far the Equestria had fallen how hard the ideals of friendship had failed everyone. And secondly an element of deliberate selfdestruction. The mind of a raider has probably descended to Fuck it all. Fuck everyone. Fuck this world. Everything in it and that has probably extended to any desire for self preservation. I jokingly thought to myself while reading that maybe in the book . . . we only see the raiders that DIDNT hammer their own body parts with a hammer and than die of dysentery from their living conditions.  Course raiders are there because they were transferred from the Fallout games. And as excessively violent as they are I think it would be disloyal to not include the level of violence and harshness that the Fallout games portray. And while Ive never played the games from what little I can tell I think the book was good at being loyal to both franchises. gt The main story is the same way the closest thing we had to a villain was the Enclave which was pretty evil but was also limited to a small group without much representation in the story. The enclave was on some level pretty much America post. At least on the level of the soldiers who felt they were retaliating against a terrorist attack. There was the killing of innocents but then . . . drone strikes have also killed innocent people. I dont know if Americas pulled a Friendship City Hiroshima?There was an evil element in the enclave though most likely after all they having their soldiers attack Raider encampments first so that theyd assume places like New Appleloosa were the same way so that nobody would realize the wasteland had civilization. gt Without the moderation and guidance of their friends they lost themselves chasing what they thought was right failing all the while as they grew apart. Well if youre referring to the ministries the book said Twilight and Rarity were the only ones that actually ran theres while the others kind of just threw ideas at theirs and didnt really have control over it. AJ was nearly assassinated by her own. gt And yet without the virtues of her friends to guide her she never considered what a terrible price tearing her soul to pieces would be.That is a good example of a virtue becoming destructive but I wonder would it have been the other virtues that wouldve kept it in check or just the moderation brought by outside feedback and larger perspective? I liked the part in one of the last chapters where it said that sacrifice without friendship becomes purely self destruction though. Perhaps thats why some people do see generosity and sacrifice as self destruction . . . They dont have the friendship that would moderate and guide it. gt If they werent loyal to their own kind then what were they loyal to?They were traitors if you saw their kind as pegasi and their country as the enclave. But they saw themselves as ponies and their country as Equestria and to that they were exceedingly loyal. But yeah the question of loyalty is the question of To what exactly are you swearing loyalty to?That said since you braught him up I just wanna say . . . I love Calamity.Of the moral assessments after Arbu and Bucklyn Cross I agreed with Calamitys the most. While much attention was given to Arbu I felt like they were pretty much acting like bandits at Bucklyn Cross even before they actually went in and I was glad when Calamity came around to the same conclusion afterward. Bucklyn Cross was an event that made me jokingly imagine that if Littlepips gang ever ran across the word retreat in a dictionary theyd be utterly confused kind of like Calamitys mock amazement when Xenith told him its actually possible to pass a trash can without rooting through it.  Really?  How?  Ah aint learned that trick. Bucklyn cross was a highlight that Littlepip and friends never actually assess how far theyre willing to get something they want when they go somewhere never ask If push comes to shove are we willing to kill every last pony in the place for this? Because the concept of retreating is never discussed its never remembered as even being an option. When shot at the gang reacts as if they have a great invisible wall to their back a mental wall. It was something I thought at Shattered Hoof when Littlepip kills someone to get to the dragons lair. I dont want to die. At that scene I thought Did Littlepip just kill someone to get a dragons treasure of unknown contents? Thats not the thought process that was going her mind at the moment. She went in to get the treasure and than killed someone because they swung at her with an energy lance presumably to push her back or because that pony thought it was a matter of their own self defense. The fic also made me think about villains and heroes. When Velvet Remedy left briefly after blowing up Splendid Valley she made a VERY faulty comparison that if Littlepip the most selfless and noble pony she knew was capable of the wanton destruction she was committed everyone else must be even closer to being evil and not worth saving. Of course Littlepip is not a bastion of moral purity but a killer hero one who saves by violence. Killer heroes are probably the second closest group of people to actual villains next to actual villains. The hero and the villain are alike in that both are willing to go into other peoples stories and decide for them whats right and whats wrong and become the judge jury and arbiter of who needs to be saved. Being part of life by nature implies a risk to morality the possibility of bad judgement or weakness putting you in the wrong but few jobs are as morally dangerous as the killer hero. If a fireman shoots a house that didnt need it some acceptable water damage happens in the midst of the heroism of being a fire fighter. A killer hero like a soldier or a policeman gets things wrong? Theyre suddenly a murderer. I know I wouldnt be up for it. When Littlepips gang hear a distress signal while in Manehattan that calls them to save the Talons from the alicorns they go in and take sides. Danger to self aside I probably wouldnt have been willing to do that. Im someone that stands and watches family arguments rather than get involved. I dont interfere because well partially out of sheer curiosity about where it will go on its own but its also because Im not willing to take the argument away from whichever side I might interrupt. I dont want to silence what anyone has to say or worse misrepresent someone or derail the argument. Or cause some other negative effect. There are lots of reasons there arent more heroes in the world but maybe one of the reasons there arent more heroes is probably the fear of becoming villains. What if you try to help that car accident victim and end up making things worse? What if you interrupt that argument and both sides just get angry at you and tell you to mind your own business? Maybe people have had too many bad experiences with others who tried to take charge of their situation and in return dont want to do the same. Or maybe the fear is not based on experiences but is overblown. When we resist the urge to talk to strangers on the bus is it because we would dislike having a stranger speak to us? Or simply because we have a fear of disturbing others that is in fact overblown?,mylittlepony,cyttdh8,2,t5_2s8bl

6551275,0,t1_czwl6z1,gt Its the same thing with the Ponyville dam the Manehattan skyscrapers and other signs of technology they exist now but we dont know how recently they were invented.Theres also the fact that a magicbased race wont develop technology in the same order we do. They control the fucking weather their leaders control day and night. Minimal need for lights. I doubt Spike is the only way to do longdistance instant messaging so phones are less needed. Etc etc its  and Im also working on my thesis someone else can go into magictech theory,mylittlepony,czwyev5,1,t5_2s8bl
6551515,0,t1_czwyhsm,I always view all three races as magical they just express magic differently. Pegasi channels magic in order to fly and to walk on clouds. Earth ponies channel it in order to be more in tune with the land when farming and to be stronger. Unicorns channel it into their horn to be able to better focus it and do spells. One race isnt more powerful at magic they just use it differently so having unicorn ancestry doesnt make you more magical at flying. I also dont think there is taboo of races even way back when. Its probably more out of history and racial differences that popualtions remain unintentionally segregated. Cloudsdale is pegasi only due to clouds being something only pegasi can walk on and being in the air which pegasi can only fly to. Canterlot is a very old city and probably was founded by unicorns way back when. It also doesnt seem as big as other metropolitan areas weve seen so there probably havent been many population shifts or growths in its history. As a result its current residents remain the same as their ancestors which happened to be unicorns. Then there are agricultural towns like appleloosa which are predominantly earth pony due to their ability to farm. If you look at larger metropolitan cities like Manehattan you see a much more diverse population. Ponyville has also seen a population boom since its founding by earth ponies and it too is very diverse though a majority seem to be earth ponies. But again thats probably due to its history of being founded by farmers. While we do see a lot of same race couples remember that we really dont see that many couples to begin with. We also do see mixed race attractions without it ever being brought up like the crush on applejack in simple ways Shining Armor and Princess Cadence or the ancient mixing of mr and mrs cakes ancestors. ,mylittlepony,czwzb2v,3,t5_2s8bl

Sure they are implied to be older than they act and even have responsibilities and businesses but theyre all presented as not all that mentally mature lacking a lot of life wisdom etc. For the purposes of relatability and room for all the lessons I assume.That and its not like Pinkie for example is the childish one they all have incredibly childish qualities and thats consistent enough for me personally to see them as much younger mentally than they wouldve had to be in the context of the real world.IMO with the way they act and only that not taking into consideration any aspect of their lives IRL theyd be young teens.

The s cartoon came on right before G.I.Joe and Transformers back then and I had no qualms watching MLP or Rainbow Bright or Carebears when I was four so it was just something to watch when I was little.Ive never particularly disliked gen  though you are right that its not the focus of the current brony fandom at large.

6920531,0,t1_d10pxrm,I was not arguing against the case of someone already with depression watching it but about the case of someone who knows someone with depression and could hypothetically take the episode to mean that that person can be helped with some kind words. Thats the context its been brought up in before I guess it just carried over.But yes you do choose to interpret whats on screen a certain way. Luna isnt harmind herself. Not even psychologically arguably. She just keeps a reminder of something she feels guilty over. Its like if you had a poster above your bed saying You skipped your grandmothers last birthday party and the grandmother is dead or something so its you know sad or whatever. The lesson is to stop beating yourself over something you regret doing in the past. Literally thats it.Do you actually know of a single case of something like this causing someone harm? Because it seems incredibly farfetched. If they open up with others tell someone exactly what theyre feeling like the episode suggests someone is likely to advise professional help. If not its not like those people were going to get it anyway. It wouldnt change anything.The authors only fault was not predicting how some people would be able to interpret their episode and lets face it there are some CRAZY interpretations out there it cant be predicted. The leap from feels guilty and keeps a reminder to suffers from depression and harms self is much bigger than you seem to think. To see the latter you have to already have a certain lens to see the episode through.,mylittlepony,d10rkxx,5,t5_2s8bl

7075035,0,t1_d1iasox,Well due to the TVY rating the show has barely even gotten away with using the word egghead so they dont have a lot to work with when it comes to insults. Im only assuming its going to be Newbie Dash based on the title. But even if thats the case based on the premise it seems like it could be an episode on bullying. Its one thing for a veteran flier to jokingly call a new pony a Newbie. Its something more serious if its a constant inyourface insult purely meant to make her feel bad about herself. In other words theres a distinct line between teasing and bullying and itll be interesting where the episode goes with it. Perhaps this disastrous first impression is something truly horrible and shes forced to relive her own failure every time she hears the nickname.,mylittlepony,d1ibhjl,2,t5_2s8bl

At a point a character says something they wouldnt normally say in the show and theres been no logical build up to it in the story or setting I tend to lose interest. This goes for any fan work though especially fanfiction. Art can telegraph a lot with the tone mood and lighting of a piece as well as its style composition and even tools and medium used. Words are a lot tougher to pull off wholesale.This is usually played for humor or to make a reference to something else but if its coming out of nowhere it ruins my immersion and I tend to lose interest after that.,mylittlepony,d1kyk46,3,t5_2s8bl

7121940,0,t1_d1myhex,I guess what Im thinking is that this show has done a fantastic job portraying a diverse and wonderful cast of all female characters. Its now in danger of the inverse of exactly what it was there to combat. Which is not a bad thing. I think if theres gonna be shows with all male casts which there basically always have been there should be shows with all female casts that are also good. I think actually what I really want is to get a spin off show with a mixed cast. Something that basically shows that gender truly doesnt matter. What Id like is not to see only one or the other or one gender elevated above another what I want to see is both sides of the gender spectrum on the same playing field doing just as well as each other. Thats something that could actually happen. ,mylittlepony,d1noi0l,1,t5_2s8bl

7197147,0,t3_4e1u9w,scootaderp Woo first CMC episode of the season and first since the Getting! Thats what Im calling itHow does it stack up?spabsmile Well... amazing! This episode was the perfect continuation of earning the cutie marks. It addressed all the things I wanted addressed explored a ton of interesting ground and then some!scootaeww So one of the things that initially concerned me about this episode was the trailer. I was afraid the Bulk Biceps plotline would take up the entire episode and steal focus from the CMCs development. Bulk Bicepsis is a really funny character in short bursts but a full episode dedicated to him wouldve gotten old. Thankfully his moment in the spotlight didnt drag on and actually introduced the conflict very nicely.abwut Apple Blooms conflict in this episode is nothing short of heartbreaking. To see her so broken outright empty without her friends around to support her suggested lots of... well lets just say very sad things about Apple Bloom maybe issues that could be addressed in a later episode. I think its an offshoot of her fear of growing up and being on her own. After all one of Apple Blooms major conflicts throughout the series revolve around growing up and potentially losing the CMC could be a cause for Apple Bloom to realize that things in her life are going to change and shes going to be on her own at some point. Thats an incredibly powerful sentiment that the episode explores very in depth and I loved it for that.scootaderp dumbfabric absmile In fact this episode developed all of the CMC in great ways showing more of their personalities and interests as individuals Scootaloos love of adrenaline and athleticism Sweetie Belles love of the arts and of course that whole thing with Apple Bloom. And now that theyve accepted that theyre going to have to do things on their own we can see even more development for each of them individually.One of the issues I along with others had with their cutie marks being so similar was that it would likely bind them all to eachother inseparably and they would become very flat and boring because they would never separate and only chase one goal but this episode completely erased those fears going for the opposite ideal and allowing each character to develop outside of eachother and I really appreciate it for that.scootacheer In conclusion there could not have been a better follow up to Crusaders Of The Lost Mark. Every question and concern that episode raised was handled brilliantly and it opens the path for only more CMC development in the future.Easily the best episode of Season  so far Im thinking a strong . for On Your Marks.,mylittlepony,d1w99ex,12,t5_2s8bl

7489674,0,t1_d2tdf3p,Have you seen Orcas? Theyre pretty vicious which is probably why Princess Luna is willing to butcher one in front of children.

Also its entirely possible Thresta didnt turn off her power completely and the blood and guts are just still invisible.  Plus why does it matter how it snuck in?  Maybe it was there the whole time or maybe the guards were asleep.Plus I dont think Thestra is the main character in this story which is why she would be introduced later on.  How is it that her ability just appears out of nowhere?  She didnt suddenly gain it from the confrontation its implied she had them when she got her cutie mark.I wont argue about the dialogue since Luna barely has any in the showjust barely over  episodes of it in factIm not counting NMM as Luna.

7780133,0,t3_4lvqo5,This was my first con and I kind of get into general thoughts about it in this thread Overall I thought it was a great first con and cant wait to go to another one.Regarding your bullet points above I was a sponsor level but just got the Sunday tea time. It was a lot of fun! I got to chat with Nicole Oliver about the Journey concert in KC and Kelly Sheridan and I chatted about breweries in our respective necks of the woods. The vendor hall was amazing and there were so many options that I just couldnt decide on what I wanted and I didnt want to go into massive debt so I just got a few things such as a Celestia Zippo. twibeamWhere did you get your BBQ? I went to Jack Stack at the Freight House and it was handsdown the best BBQ Ive ever had. It was nearly a religious experience.  I hear you regarding the organization a bit but theres only so much you can plan for. The tornado warnings actually shut down KCI and caused a brief evac so they were behind for Friday. The shipping for the grab bags was also set back by the weather. Should there have been a backup plan? Yeah probably but having run events myself I know how hard it is to plan for every possibility. I will cheerfully admit to being biased because of my own event planning experiences though. I was disappointed that the So You Want to be a Voice Actor panel was cancelled on Sunday but understand why they wanted to keep Whooves Line since it was pretty darn funny. The KCI area was pretty sparse admittedly. Zona Rosa wasnt too far though so I was able to get my shopping and nonBBQ food pretty easily. Im pretty happy if Im within  minutes of a Cracker Barrel and a ChickfilA but then again Im from the hinters so my satisfaction bar is pretty low. I didnt book at the con hotel due to having bad experiences with Holiday Inn back in the day and the Best Western Plus down the road was pretty good. Sorry to hear that you had a bad experience though! Youd think a con venue would focus on having a great lodging experience too...Overall I really enjoyed myself but realize that I dont have much of a frame of reference and all of your points are pretty solid. Once I go to a few more cons I can probably be a tab more objective about the technical aspects. Still the most important part is that folks have fun!,mylittlepony,d3qjbxp,1,t5_2s8bl

7805025,0,t3_4m8a1c,We know that Unicorns can have a magical surge as seen in The Cutie Mark Chronicles when Twilight hatches Spike. Given that a magical surge would be born from the innate magic of a pony we can assume that Pegasus and Earth ponies would also be able to have a magical surge. When Twilight had hers there was a lot of polymorphing involved and general Unicorn magics. So what would happen if a Pegasus were to have a magical surge? Would the weather around them spiral out of control and create unpredictable storms or impossible scenarios? Earth ponies might cause earthquakes or cause the local foliage to grow out of control. Since all three types of ponies are magical in nature all of them should be able to have a magical surge. Maybe it doesnt happen nearly as often in Pegasus and Earth ponies because their magic is much more passive than that of a Unicorns. Im almost hoping that this subject has been touched on in a fanfic somewhere.,mylittlepony,d3tchbz,7,t5_2s8bl

7974873,0,t1_d4ce6nf,I cant completely disagree with that perspective since the problems with the family and the problems with the community were as you pointed out so tightly intertwined as to be basically the same problem. The general theme though of cutie map episodes seems to be how friendships on a small scale affect community wellbeing and the web of friendships born from it.We did see that the father and daughter seemed to reconcile but the mission was not declared a success. Likely then the reconciliation would have been shortlived due to the influence of the community. In other words the underlying cause of the stress on their relationship was not resolved. It was not until Rarity and PP were able to show the community a way to be more true to themselves and thus fix the underlying problem with the community that the actual problem was resolved. Therefore the map may have sent them to fix the communal problem and in so doing help the restaurant owners.On the flip side it could also be said that correcting the communal issues required an example to be set and the restaurant owners were the perfect couple to give that example. In this view the map may have sent Rarity and PP to help the couple knowing that it would also help the community.Whether the map sent them to fix the problem with this one couple or with the community seems largely a matter of perspective since the solution to both was the same and fixing either required fixing them both. However map episodes seem to be community focused which is why I am leaning toward the first interpretation.,mylittlepony,d4cg9hu,3,t5_2s8bl

A little more after season  but not a lot.spspikehappyIm a fan of cartoons too Ive watched all the shows you listed and Ive kinda come to accept that some mediums just struggle with certain content. For cartoons one of these recurring difficulties is plotsmorals. Adventure Time is one of the few that IMO handles them well. So even though MLP isnt particularly groundbreaking in that aspect thats only really disappointing by comparison to how good the rest of the show is. Which pretty much explains why I can overlook this one shortcoming  the rest of it is just so darn good.And hey now and again the stories do surprise me with their maturity and complexity.,mylittlepony,d4ymzpx,6,t5_2s8bl

8286370,0,t1_d5dbqop,sbbook Once upon a time in the magical land of Equestria there was a race of diminutive adorable little ponies. They shared their enchanted realm with dozens upon dozens of other kinds and for many years every race held an equal share over the world.But ponies were different than the others. They came in three distinct breeds capable of intermingling together but gifted with very different forms of magic. Earth ponies held a unique connection to the land. Pegasi could fly and control the weather itself. Unicorns had access to the base power of creation. And yet at first the ponies remained separate from one another hating one another for the differences between their kinds it took great turmoil and famine and the guidance of wise leaders to make the tribes put aside their differences and amass into one harmonious society.Every foal in Equestria knows that story. But what they do not know is that the united pony race though now in harmony with itself had not altogether abandoned hatred for the other. While unity was good for the ponies the alliance between the three kinds would prove to be a disaster for every other type of being in the world.The ponies began to begrudge other species their share of the planet. The first to be subjugated were the cattle and the sheep utterly magicless and without the ability to defend themselves. They were enslaved so completely that over thousands of years they became domesticated not remembering in even the faintest traces of their cultural memory that once they were free. And with this the ponies were content.Next the ponies turned their sights against the changelings the mysterious buglike beings that inhabited the land. The ponies feared and distrusted them above all other kinds and attacked them with hoof and with horn and with wing. The changelings were scattered. Most of the great Queens were slain the rest retreating into hiding in the most barren inhospitable places in the world. And with this the ponies were content.Next the dragons became a focus. Where once great dragon kingdoms were scattered across the world the ponies used their magic and amassed might to topple kingdom after kingdom. Even the greatest of Dragon Lords could not stand up against such mighty armies. Earth pony kicks could shatter their scales pegasi storms could flood their lands and unicorn magic could fell even the mightiest of dragon. In time they too fled Equestria the last of the Dragon Lords settling his kind in a barren wasteland that ponies did not see fit to claim. Only a few rogue dragons were left as hermits always forced to dwell in hiding or secrecy lest they be molested by meddlesome ponies. But with this the ponies were content.Next the griffons. These avian beings shared much magic with the pegasi with whom they were great rivals but had always been able to hold their own against them. No longer with the addition of earth ponies and unicorns into the struggle. The griffons were driven to the lands across the sea and Equestrias weather fell exclusively under pegasus control. With this the ponies were content.Again race after race was subjugated or driven into hiding. The yaks were driven to the north. The buffalo were restricted to the desert. The deer were forced to hide in the Everfree the sea serpents and sirens became all but extinct the fauns and centaurs fled to lands on the other end of the planet. And the ponies were content at long last. They were the masters of Equestria.Or at least... they were.The constant wars and violence against other kinds held a cosmic price. Just as friendship is magic so is enmity the force of disharmony that they generated in their genocides had an effect one that spread ripples across the whole of creation. And these ripples of disharmony attracted a new menace to their world.The reign of Discord was swiftly established as his magic fed by disharmony was greater than all the other forms of magic on the planet. For many years he ruled spreading chaos across the whole land and grinding ponykind beneath his chimeric paws and claws. When questioned of his right to lord it over the ponies land he would only laugh and say Who gave you the right to make this a ponies land?And ponies were discontent.In time a pair of normal ponies under his reign ascended to a new breed never before seen in the world alicorns. Celestia and Luna ascended to bear the traits of all pony types in equal measure and upon finding ancient relics from before the ages of disharmony and suffering were able to imprison Discord within a stone statue. They became the rulers of the land kind and just guardians of Equestria and ponykind.Celestia and Luna were not tyrants. But they never made an effort to right the wrongs of the past. The changelings were not invited back. The dragons they were content to leave in the wasteland beyond the seas. The cattle and the sheep were technically free to leave their farms at any time but society would find its way to corral them back in due time.Equestria was a ponies land.And with that they were content.,mylittlepony,d5dcses,4,t5_2s8bl

8395525,0,t1_d5q0m0x,Dark Tower series is a long fantasy story. It probably isnt an easy place to start with him since the first book is different stylistically then the rest of the series and can be polorizing. The series also was written over the course of much of his career but the last three of the main series were kind of rushed. The Talisman which he wrote with Peter Straub is actually kind of similiar in tone and feel but would be easier to read in order to get a feel for his fantasy style. For his more traditional horror books The Shining is where you should start although Pet Semetary and Cujo are also good choices. ,mylittlepony,d5qzk8k,2,t5_2s8bl

8428424,0,t1_d5v19na,twidawYeah I felt that way too at first but if you ask me the trick is to wait until you see someone talking about something that piques your interest and then just engage in a conversation with someone. And then if someone else says something youre interested in or if someone hops onto your conversation then talk with them too! And suddenly youre making lots of new friends!Dont feel pressured about the waves of people talking just slowly ease yourself into it one person at a time. You dont have to be friends with everybody all at once though props to anyone who manages thatOh and dont forget to say hi and bye whenever you enter and leave chat!

8500869,0,t1_d641fny,Well heres the thing. M. A. Larson has come out more than once and said that Twilights ascension was to be the series finale but that Hasbro called them and said to make it the Season  finale so that they could have alicorn Twilight toys. So we got what we did.If it were up to me I would have made it a flash forward showing that she would be princess someday as her destiny. Then all the rest of the show could lead up to it.But even with that I dont think it fits in with the world thats built. See I never bought the idea that the Mane Six are any more special than the average pony on the street. We see the show through their eyes just because thats how it happens to be. Yes Twilight is Princess Celestias student and yes Rainbow Dash is a top flyer but the bond they have as friends is no less magical than that of Minuette and Lemon Hearts or of Spitfire and her Wonderbolt crew. It came up again during The Cutie ReMark. Yes Starlight stopping the rainboom was devastating to Equestria but I think so would the breaking of any other friendship bond. Because everypony is important. Again Im not like the folks on mlp who shouted ruined forever! I like whats been done with the show since and especially Starlight Glimmer as Twilights protege. But I also would have been good with everyone staying in their roles at the beginning and burning a lot slower on the changes.,mylittlepony,d645tch,11,t5_2s8bl

8598235,0,t1_d6gd0v1,I think the dramaseriousphilosophical stuff just clashes with the general mood of the show too much for me to enjoy I can only take things like Blink because theyre short and mainly present a quick idea that is more universal and not ponydependent. I like lighthearted feelgood stuff when it comes to fanfics. Though not stuff thats absurd and doesnt take itself any seriously.Also I am more of a big fan of the EQG worlds concept than Sunset in particular. I mean I like Sunset but I think its mostly because shes kind of a wellrounded character not one or two things to the extreme like the mane so shes much easier to relate to and much more fitting for a protagonist that I can sympathize with. I think Sunspawned is the second story in that short series though be sure not to miss the previous one.And yeah I thought about using bookshelves but I pretty much never ever reread stories and having a bunch on hand to recommend to someone didnt really seem useful. Besides its too late Id want to fill such a bookshelf with everything recommendable from what Ive already read and Id have to spend an ungodly amount of effort digging that up and remembering what was what and what was good.Ill check those two stories out but Blink was a bit of an exception for me. The only other truly dark story I remember enjoying and by truly I mean not something funkydark like Twlights a zombie now! was some story where Twilight was getting old and starting to lose mental functions and it was presented as a series of letters from Spike to Celestia.,mylittlepony,d6gde18,1,t5_2s8bl

The whole interview in a diner concept was both humorous and effective. Couple that with some amazing character moments and a well written plot and is clearly deserved its top spot.  Its only real weakness is the lack of world building but even then thats minor due to the cameos and Easter eggs scatter across the episode. spsgpopcorn  A Hearths Warming Tail  Similar to Saddle Row review this one gets its place for its style. I do love me a good musical episode and this one was gorgeous showing us a personified version of the dickens classic A Christmas Carol. On top of the beautiful music and amazing visuals you had a rather heartfelt and relatable lessons weve seen between the two lights. Also Twilight was Adorable in this one. spspikehappy  Gauntlet of Fire  An obvious choice but it did everything right. Good Character progression for spike. Great lore expansion for the dragon race and the addition of Ember and Torch as characters. It was a great episode and if it wasnt for the stylistic masterpieces above It could have easily grabbed the top spot.  sp scootaplease Two honorable mentions for the top three are Newbie Dash and  Flutter Brutter. Both offered great character progression and world expansion. unfortunate I they lacked the style that  and  had but in most other seasons those two would have been in the running for my top three episodes.,mylittlepony,d6pzdrf,4,t5_2s8bl

As such bronies who are totally secretive about it or absolutely HEY LOOK AT ME SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE HERE are much rarer than back then.I also think as its become less personal and more identitybased its become a bit less kind.

8855998,0,t3_51imbq,Yet another good Nostalgiacritic editorial. I think its just very alluring to combine the comedic and serious tones to explore deep issues in a fun environment. I think its a similar thing with darker MLP fan works which may involve war or torture but you still have cute and colorful characters and settings along for the ride. I think a lot of things I enjoy have an infotainment quality to them they actually discuss something but on a platter of silliness whether thats an insightful Calvin and Hobbes strip or one of the more interesting articles on Cracked.com. Its interesting to note as Doug points out in the video that the insightful meat and exploration of a piece of work wouldnt attract people if thats what you advertised about them that they explored certain issues or had good messages. You can still advertise those aspects though if you advertise the interesting story through which heavy issues will be explored for example the story of Dr. Jeckyll struggling with Mr. Hyde is interesting because on some level we know its about repression and morality. Anybody can state opinions on some heavy issue but that doesnt promise theyll tell a story well whether you can explore the issue in a novel or interesting way with characters you love and care about in a setting that youre invested in . . . that is where the advertising of weirdness comes in.

9034295,0,t1_d7xqg49,scootapleasePeople forget that power does not a Mary Sue make. Batmans at peak physical perfection and seems to know literally every martial art in the world which could easily make for a bland godawful character. But its tempered by his emotional and psychological fragility which makes his strength level supplement the interesting things about him rather than cement itself as the focus of his character.spscootacheer Or look at Celestia! Many fans believe that shes secretly extremely powerful sometimes imagined to be capable of unleashing nuclear armageddon with her magic on a whim. Again if this were to be revealed early on with her and made the focus of her appearances shed be a terrible character. But she still has fans because her backstory paints her as a being of many failures and her lack of visible strength on the show prompts them to imagine reasons for why she holds back.spsgpopcorn Starlight to me is interesting for reasons far removed from her power level. She suffered from a lack of friendship in a world where friendship is everything. She grew bitter and tried to push an ideology that would let her control friendship the elusive key to happiness that had always hopped out of her reach. She became a mare consumed with anger and a lust for vengeance when she was thwarted but had the strength of will to realize shed fallen off the right path and willingly turn herself in for punishment. Since then shes become the only villain to have thrown herself wholeheartedly into an active rehabilitation program Luna was reinstated as a Princess pretty much immediately Discord has barely ever shown a hint of guilt or remorse for his past actions and much of Sunsets inprogress reformation took place off screen. Though I love all of these characters dearly.sptwiprideStarlights power level isnt the point of her character. Its only a mechanism by which the writers can place her into the story they want to tell much like how Twilights prodigious skill at magic wasnt the point of her character but was rather a setup for great episodes like Boast Busters.,mylittlepony,d7xs27y,11,t5_2s8bl

By and large its not children who buy comic books anymore but men in their s.Raising the shows rating from Y to Y isnt going to send fans clamorong for the exits anytime soon and any dips in sales would be negligible if they were to exist at all.I will give you this though Hasbro is beholden by no means to act logically.

I really want to tell you I can see what youre asking me but I dont.I see only logical ans technical arguments. I think Ive missed some subtleties maybe.gtYou said you had reasoning that fell way outside rule  as if your canon involved a lot of sexual content of some sort.No. I use the religious definition of canon. It means sexuality is banned. But the whole argumentation is all around that.As only a very few justifications for or against can pass rule  its easy to infer mines wouldnt whatever they are.Admittedly I just dont want to take any risk towards this rule here exceptionally.gtI imagine interpreting eventsactions within the show in a sexual manner which I dont.Then explain me what you do exactly please.gtI dont think any events within the show are intended to feature sex appeal or sexual attraction but I also dont think anyone on the staff is imagining ponies as completely nonmammallian genderless asexual entities in and of themselves. Making the difference between mares and stalions is fine  its one of the main point of the show.Toying me on implying sexual intercourse between ponies is not fine to me at all regardless of your intent. Its a big nope to me. a never and in any case kind of nope.gt And because I personally have no stake in imagining that arguments to that effect hold very little weight to me. You may weave alternative theories that theyre not mammals but since I have no personal stake in that area I just take things at face value.I suppose I do have stakes on that.gt it just has less than zero to do with me telling someone that what they said was an opinion which is actually a relativistic statement.I suppose I can see a symbolic relationship as I did correctly inferred your leaning based on your wording.Its made of trying to dismiss my argument as a meaningless subjective opinion. I find it neither a proper way to deal with my argument or a proper argument in itself as all statements are subjective to me.I dealt with hardcore determinism only argumentation and lost because I had to advocate giving up on logic to get my point across.If you can understand this argument without trying to dismiss it at face value chances are youre able to understand roughly what my relativism is about.

9427438,0,t1_d9asm47,I know a few that may strike your fancysptwicrazyIf youve been around MLP fanfiction for a while youve probably heard of Hard Reset basically Twilight gets stuck in a time loop mere moments before a massive changeling invasion which causes the elements to catastrophically explode in short order so she has to unravel plots and mysteries plus perform many feats of badassery to fix things. The story has a couple of mindbending sequels but the first stands alone if you only kinda like it and dont want to continue that universe.spppfearThe Immortal Game is a very dark but very action packed tale about our favorite ponies trying to fend off the end of the world. They all get powered up but none more so than Twilight. This has quite a lot of battles and awesome feats of power.spflutteryayFoal of the Forest is the first in a long but complete series. Theres plenty of slice of life here but theres also a lot of martial arts. Think anime levels of powering uptrainingability diversity kind of like Naruto Bleach Hunter X Hunter or Fairy Tale. The first installment is a little iffy in my opinion I think the author was still finding his stride and his main character comes off a bit too much like a bad Gary Sue for my liking but I promise the series gets better and the characters develop quite well overall. Id recommend it.sptwistareIf you like the game XCOM Enemy Unknown then youll probably like Stardust It has some decent action but thats not as much the focus. Basically Twilight ends up thrown into the middle of the conflict between the humans and aliens and must earn peoples trust and help them to defeat the invasion.sprdsaluteThe Dusk Guard Rise is a great story about the formation and first missions of a new spec ops branch of the guard that is composed entirely of a single team of specialists. Great characters and action all through. Theres also a few shorts that follow individual characters after the events of that first story and a full fledged sequel looking at a new specialist group this time bounty hunters.sptwismugThe Moonstone Cup Twilight enters an epic magic competition kind of like the Goblet of Fire in Harry Potter.spajslyThis is a classic and is more a grand epic along the lines of LotR than it is purely about ponies being awesome but theres plenty of awesomeness there too.

9503884,0,t3_5ayzv7,rpinkieoohSince apparently all I can watch is kids animation for Halloween I decided to rewatch Coraline.Thats a movie that really caught me by surprise the first time since I didnt know it would be a mysteryhorror thing. Its hard to imagine a horror movie for kids but I think it definitely belongs in that category. It has an art style that makes everything ugly without being too gross it very gradually builds up the tension and unease throwing in a few spikes and it features a powerful supernatural element with rules we can understand yet not fully comprehend.sprpartyBesides the genre I was also surprised by how unusual the story is compared to the usual DisneyPixar stuff I normally watch. Its kind of a twisted Alice in Wonderland story combined with the typical story of a kid with overworked parents combined with a bunch of weird stuff. Like Kubo there is a lot of creativity put into this rather small world and a lot of information that needs to be conveyed and thats done very gradually over the course of the entire movie.sppinkieAll the story elements just fit together really well. Each act introduces new elements and everything comes together in the climax. The theme of a little girl who is sick of not being heard goes well with the story of temptation and its also well represented by her name being constantly mispronounced. The parents arent quite the onedimensional jerks youd expect from a lazy movie and despite having a somewhat rough relationship the audience can see that they do acknowledge their kid. The villain is also shown to be decently clever when she kidnaps Coralines parents while being noticeably absent as a predictive movespoiler and having a clever supernatural foe is very intimidating.sppinkiefear...It doesnt have much in terms of humor but I must say Wyborn is a pretty dark joke.Its also kinda meta when you think that hes only in the movie so that Coraline would have someone to talk to during certain scenes.sprppcuteOne thing that I find quite memorable is how the other world doesnt operate entirely based on the villains will. Some creatures seem to have a mind of their own and while that makes things a bit more heartwrenching it also makes the villain seem fallible enough for our hero to overcome. While the villain is quite an eldrich horror its not allpowerful its just powerful enough to be extremely threatening and force our hero to be cunning. A very delicate balance must be struck in order to make the underpowered hero win believably and I think it nails that balance.spppseesyouThe biggest risk for the movies story is probably predictability. The audience will realize the temptation plot before the character but I think there are so many factors counteracting that predictability that it becomes irrelevant. The revelation comes long before the end so theres a lot to enjoy afterwards and before it happens were still learning so much about the world and characters that the viewers curiosity should build engagement. The movies style and genre are so unique among kids movies that it should easily catch the viewers attention even if they realize where the story is going unless they are put off by dark fantasy in which case tough luck.spjoyAnimationwise its the stellar stopmotion Laika is known for. Even more so than the beautiful DisneyPixar CGI movies its fascinating to see the effort that goes into stopmotion of this caliber. There is so much that viewers take for granted because they make it look seamless but the more you think about it the more how the fuck did they do that plays in your head. For instance theyre animating hair in stopmotion. Youd think there are certain inherent limitations to the genre but back in the day Jack Skellington was the skinniest puppet they could make.sprpinkiepoutThere is however one thing that I find off. So stop motion is noticeably less smooth than CGI as if its playing at a lower framerate and that framerate can vary depending on the scene and level of detail. The jumping mice loop are so noticeably lowframerate that I find it hard to see them as animated. I think it may have been intentional especially considering they had a mirroring technique at their disposal but I just find it weird. Its only one short scene though all the other highdetail scenes looked amazing.sppinkiedontBut speaking of amazing animation efforts the extras show some animated scenes that were cut from the final movie because they were just slowing down the pace. Considering how painstaking it is to animate in stopmotion I wonder I dont see any fully animated cut scenes from DisneyPixar movies its always storyboards.sppinkiesadFrom the makingof it also seems they put quite a bit of effort into the D filming by taking two pictures of each scene from different angles in order to create the effect. But unfortunately its still the old coloredglasses D which I just cant handle.sprohhiTo say more about visual detail theres some real emphasis on colors. The real world is pretty gray and dreary save for a few noticeable splashes of color namely Coraline herself and stuff like gloves on a table. The other world has strong warm colors when it wants to.For more visual detail I like how its briefly noticeable that she never has anything on her plate. Or when her butt changes. Or how the other actresses didnt have button eyes because of a thing.spgummystareA little detail that I find odd is that despite supernatural elements being mostly tied to the other world Dr. Eggman can talk to his mice anyway. To the point of hearing Coralines name spoken correctly even. I dont think this bit was necessary we got two more foreshadowing scenes right after that anyway.I also find it weird that the doll wasnt with Coraline when she met Dr. Eggman and the actresses and yet the next night featured him including a certain environmental detail. This is probably a hardtonotice plothole since only secondtime viewers will have the knowledge to realize it Im sure the staff knew about it and decided to leave it in because of more important reasons.spppboringThis is the first movie that comes to mind when I think of my favorite western nonDisneyPixar movies.

It also toys with something Im personally very fond of titles. I play a lot of RPGs as in pen and paper RPGs like DampD Shadowrun D etc and I always like having my players if Im DMing earn titles if they reach that level of renown. Its one of my favorite things about fantasy characters the idea that great deeds would follow the character as a part of their identity in the eyes of many. This fic takes a very silly turn with the idea but I loved it.spraritygrumpNext is Why Cant I Be Your Rara an underappreciated imo Drama very light touches of dramedy by Oroboro of Fractured Sunlight and the Sunset Shipping Project fame. Rarara is jealous of Applejacks relationship with Rara and feels a little put out. The fic throws a little dour headcanon in there for the sake of plot but it feels genuine and only adds to the story. This short lovely fic was one of my favorite things done with The Mane Attraction on FimFic and I hope yall enjoy it as well.spsunsetshimmerHere we have Tau Do I Love Thee a short simple very nerdy SunLight RomCom made for Tau Day . Quite silly but immensely enjoyable and I really can just imagine Sunset and SciTwis relationship starting with an argument over which geometric standard is superior.spspcelestiamadLast but not least we have Royal Review Do you find critics largely insufferable? Do you think negative affectations are an abomination? If remotely yes then you should get some immense satisfaction out of this fic. Based on the events of The Saddle Row Review this fic focuses on the three major Canterlot royals Princesses Celestia and Luna and Prince Blueblood throwing their two bits in. What starts as a review of restaurants soon becomes a review of a certain food snob.Thorough character assassination of a character truly deserving of being assassinated. Metaphorically speaking. Probably.spspscootacheerThats all folks! Hope you enjoy this odd assortment fics and then go on to find a few more like them! Very enjoyable fics that just dont have the momentum to stay in the limelight after their hayday. sptwibeamHave a fantastic Thursday a great rest of your week and Ill see you guys next time!,mylittlepony,dcceprt,11,t5_2s8bl

10501988,0,t1_dcyc94t,gt Of course now I get the feeling like Im the asshole saying Haha I dont have any of these problems. If that is so please tell me as I have only marginally more tact than Rainbow Dash. Same goes for condescension or whatever.Id say you came closer to that in your first comment. Not the haha part but just the I dont have any of these problems part. In this comment you talk about having had lingering prejudices and than you dealt with them as well as showed awareness of your own flaws. I didnt even make the arrogance connection until you brought it up. It sounded more like you were simply talking about rationally evaluating your biases and suppressing the ones you found to be baseless. Ironically you sound insecure about being arrogant which I think could possibly be a funny character to have in a book. I know Im perfect does that make me hard to relate to? I just dont have all these insecurities you normal people have! Nnnggg.   That phrasing would indeed sound condescending. Funnily enough Id say my response to your first comment was basically a response to your disclaimer where I said Technically I usually genuinely dont care what others think to. and Yeah I used to think I was just like you . . . One day you might be in for a surprise. Of course being adamant at all about this would make me pretty smug myself. Basically whenever someone talks to me about not caring what others think I think I dance like the armless things from Silent Hill in public while laughing and hissing. The ideas not new to me.I think arrogance and condescension is probably mostly about how big you assume the divide between you and others is and how much emphasis you give it. You actually got me to google the difference between arrogance and confidence I think this link was the best. I think arrogance has more to do with how you view others and a need to prove oneself and not admit weakness. For example I was more arrogant myself until I realized I had peers that had the same knowledge or values that I did. Shifting back the original topic at hand perhaps I need to examine what I associate MLP with. Interestingly the brony fandom hasnt helped. Basically theyve said MLP has a bad rep because of G and before. G honest to Celestia legitimately sucks. If you say you like MLP people will imagine GG til you correct them. And I dont actually think thats true because I dont think most people have seen those shows. More accurately people would see their idea of MLP based on commercials for little girls toys. Thats what I associate with it.And its not that much better.  ,mylittlepony,dcyif9j,2,t5_2s8bl

11029847,0,t1_dei77a7,Ive read all the mlp comics and I cant remember them adding much of anything. Sure the generally accepted scenario of how she escaped Canterlot and ended up in the human world comes from the comic which I still keep forgetting because the movie pretty much spends a single throwaway line on Sunsets backstory which is hard to believe. But its just backstory a short vague undetailed partial backstory and the movies ignore it completely. Besides after her defeat shes become so completely removed from her old evil version that the backstory doesnt even matter as it provides no context for her character anymore. Heck even in Rainbow Rocks she refers to her past self as if it was a different person entirely.The anonamiss story is also kinda stupid and adds pretty much nothing to her character  at least nothing thats ever been reflected in the movies.At this point the only solid characterization that Sunsets ever had comes only from fanfics. In the official media theres simply no great story to collect about Sunset.,mylittlepony,dei7i1r,2,t5_2s8bl

11191142,0,t3_5zrsuu,It varies significantlyWhen the conflict is an ingroup one between the M or between one of them and their family members I tend to approve of the morals. Those episodes tend to portray characters as flawed but ultimately goodhearted A depiction I find very relevant and a strong lesson to teach. Your friends after all may be very much flawed but theyre still your friends.When the conflict moves outside the group however I often find that the power of plot takes over and the moral is perhaps unintentionally twisted into one I cant approve of. Very often I feel its a product of oversimplifying very complex issues resulting in a skewed moral that doesnt work outside of a contrived situation  and perhaps not even then.,mylittlepony,df0i3xh,3,t5_2s8bl

11199617,0,t3_5ztj90,aIn the past my main method of operations was to plan out chapters write one out review and edit it over let my editor work it over and then publish the chapter once Im happy with what I have. This meant for somebody like me I could get chapters out maybe once every week and a half to two weeks depending on other commitments in my life.In my latest project however Ive decided to try writing the whole story out and having it finished and edited before even considering publishing a chapter for the public to read. On the one hand Im finding this method is helping me write a more coherent story since I can go back and make revisions to earlier parts of the story if I think things couldve been written better. However this also means that as far as my readers are concerned Ive gone silent for nearly three months now. On top of that as I draw near the finishing line my motivation and energy has waned. Parts of me wonder if its because without any feedback beyond my editor Ive no idea whether what Ive written works or not. In the past any time Ive felt a dip in motivation I could reread some of the past reviews and comments to remind myself that people do enjoy the shit I write.With this experiment almost concluded I must soon decide which method works better for me and Im still a little mixed.What are your thoughts fellow writers?
