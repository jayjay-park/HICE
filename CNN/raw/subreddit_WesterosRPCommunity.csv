4376884,0,t3_3ax3ic,My character is Asher Storm the bastard son of Lord Baratheon Stormlanders can fix some of the details and Myranda Estermont. Having lived on Greenstone for the first sixteen years of life Asher declares that he will set out to Storms End and ask what he must to do be Asher Baratheon. He is well trained with sword and shield somewhat prideful. His mother and his grandfather and all the other people of Greenstone had been kind to him but realized the duty they had to train him and prepare him for life often making them be stern with him and sometimes crushing his hopes as a child. Once he gets to Storms End he is given a quest by the Lord in exchange to be legitimized. ,WesterosRPCommunity,csj0e30,2,t5_38e35
