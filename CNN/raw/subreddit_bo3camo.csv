6702337,0,t1_d0bmcij,Sorry no. I made it from scratch and honestly I made it poorly. That is a skin colored background and like  layers of shapes to carve out the head.I would upload screenshots but I cant log into the game. Skip this boring story Im about to tell...The media player I use suddenly wasnt pumping out every audio channel for a certain movie. So I went around looking for solutions. I updated the media player and when that didnt work I upgraded some my codecs. The codecs messed with windows media player or something. Now when i launch BO it informs me that I need some Windows Media Player files or something and sends me to Microsofts download for them. When I go to install them I get an error saying it isnt the right version for my computer. Bullshit. Windows  bit SP. Not that hard to hit the correct link. So I try upgrading to windows . That just about bricks my computer and I still cant launch  BO.TLDR I cant log into the game but I swear it isnt due to cheating.,bo3camo,d0ckvl7,1,t5_39q97
