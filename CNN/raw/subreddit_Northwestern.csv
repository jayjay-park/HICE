3194362,0,t1_corwovw,I dont know who she was referring to directly so Im not really sure what the context was. I think the idea stems from the fact that NU Divests motives were rooted in protecting oppressed Palestinians who are often racially discriminated against. Many students of color identified with and supported the movement because they too have felt the burden of discrimination both at Northwestern and beyond. So I guess the argument can be made that those who have not really dealt with such issues white males mainly may not care much about that angle or just may not realize the extent to which discrimination can harm. Thus they may feel uncomfortable with some other aspect of the proposal without really considering the strong discomfort of students of color at Northwestern or more importantly in this case the extreme discomfort felt by Palestinians directly impacted by Israeli occupation.,Northwestern,cot3g98,0,t5_2qptt

3485155,0,t1_corubhq,But the underlying premise is that all Jewish andor Zionist students are privileged. This erases not only antiSemitism or minimizes it  but it also erases the very nature of the diversity within Zionists and Jews themselves  e.g. not all white. I realize that I am white and pass as such  people on the street cant tell Im a religious minority but can tell Im white. Still it is offensive for NUs BDS movement to lump all Jews into one white category since this is falsehood and oversimplification at best.,Northwestern,cppj6ns,2,t5_2qptt

10487968,0,t3_5q1hnv,Im a transfer. My college GPA before transferring was a .X. My experience at Northwestern has been amazing. I did a lot of thinking about what kind of school I wanted to end up at when the transfer process was all over with so I wasnt really surprised by or annoyed with anything at NU that I didnt already expect. The transfers I know who had a rough first few monthsyear were the ones who didnt think about what type of school they wanted to end up at and instead just applied to really good schools. Leaving my first school a top LAC I knew I wanted top academics to be next to a big city and to have quality division I sports i.e. Pac SEC BG NOT Ivy. I knew I would have been miserable at a place like Rice or an Ivy. Coming from a school with a lack of sports culture I knew it would really just bring me down as the school pride is kind of suppressed in a way by not having sports and I really needed some sort of school pride mentally. The quarter system is great and the major selection is okay. Cost of living seems reasonable if you find some roommates good few transfers I know lived together. I know a few transfers who are RAs so they get free room and board. The Greek life scene is about  of campus but there seems to be plenty of other things to do. Im not Greek and I never have had a problem finding something fun to do. We live  minutes via the L from Chicago. There is really no reason to complain about things to do. Favorite How wonderfully driven my classmates are towards their careers whether that be in academia business science or some other field. Having such driven people around you all the time just feels great. It gives me the energy to push myself harder. Least favorite That Im a transfer and dont get the whole  year experience  ,Northwestern,dcwx5pj,2,t5_2qptt
10488613,0,t3_5q71xn,Ive said it before but it bears repeating Northwestern is a beautiful amazing place full of amazing insanely talented people. You might be tempted to compare yourself against some truly incredible people but dont!Some people are incredibly social go Greek and are going to date nights and mixers and parties every other day and suddenly you start to feel like your social life is dead even though you already have plenty of great friends or are involved in other sorts of activities.There will always be someone better than you in your classes. You might see them doing better than you and start thinking that classes were made intentionally hard to weed you out while others succeed. But actually classes are hard because everyone here  yes even you  are driven and up for the challenge.Everyone here has one thing theyre good at perhaps better at than anyone else. You might see a lot of people succeeding at a lot of different things but no one person is perfect at everything. So find the one thing youre better at and dont try to compare yourself when you think you fall short everywhere else.And as to the charge of how everyone is tense closed off and just keeping up appearances of fitting in ... yes thats how most human beings tend to behave under stress. But if you sit down with someone and talk honestly youll find that most people here are willing to open up.,Northwestern,dcwzsr8,6,t5_2qptt
