217827,0,t1_cf38dod,Ive read it dude but youre right I havent internalized it. What does that even mean? Im not going to read it over and over again until I suddenly realize its true. Is there a difference between a man and a member of the male gender?? Why does there need to be??You say you go your own path and dont care what other men think then you state this. This makes me think you do care. You dont have to like sports or good liquors it just makes it easier as you have more common ground with many men. Pave your own damn path if you want.Yeah thats exatly what Im trying to say. You should be encouraging people to make their own path! Youre trying to make people fit into some box and that causes more stress than it relieves. I wasnt trying to sell myself to the subreddit Im trying to use myself as an exampleas a man I read the stuff here and Im like what the fuck I dont agree with any of this stuff but I think I AM a man. I realize I probably sounded a little cocky talking about myself but yeah I was focusing on the things that Im proud of myself aboutyou can be a confident man and have beliefs that are different than this subreddit.So who gives you guys the right to define things like this? Like Ive read the TRP stuff on the sidebad and whateverbut why dont I also believe it? What Im saying is do you not see the disconnectflaw in the reasoningthat youre all about giving men confidence happiness etc and yet youre defining what it takes to get there and what it means once you get there and in the process making men feel inadequate and ashamed of certain things about them. You make men feel like they need to change to fit into some sort of definition which to me is completely contradictory to your original goal! If this is truly antifeminist and whatever else you should be about empowering individuals and letting them express their individuality...Maybe Im wrongIll go read TRP some more and try and figure it out.,becomeaman,cf397hw,0,t5_2w1ya
424938,0,t1_cfo8lg2,If you only shake when lifting you definitely dont have ET if your hands or head or tongue etc. shake enough during daily life that it interferes with basic tasks thats a different story. Just reduce the weight a bit to where the last rep is reasonably difficult but not so much that youre shaking like a leaf. I still get shaky sometimes particularly with bench and tricep work. Stay hydrated and fueled as dehydration can sometimes cause feelings of weakness and shakiness.,becomeaman,cfot5x1,1,t5_2w1ya

You will never have a fulfilling life if you keep appeasing your girlfriend and the more you appease her the less respect she will have for you. Lift  times per week and eat more on lifting days.

2620605,0,t1_cmzytoh,Im not gonna lie. Sorry if this offends you but to be blunt just get a fucking hair cut. You arent going to be manly if you keep your hair long and listen to girly bands by your own accord. Sure you may find a niche community that you can be a member of and be manly there but you seem to be seeking the traditional meaning. Itll start with a haircut.

3805298,0,t3_33gl0w,I think I roughly understand where you might come from.  But judging by your unwillingness to push others around you might have already lost all chances to be different.  Sometimes what it takes or rather the progression itself of your being arriving to point where you feel comfortable poking fun at others  thats confidence.  Let me give you an example say I was poking fun at my friends boldness prior inside a few things could happen I worry about hurting his feelings I worry about what the social group backlash. I dont want any negative consequencesAnd so you shut the hell up and nothing happened.  You didnt take any risk and you are still the same you. Conversely you need to take calculated risks and say what you have to say.  And through the process you You learn to how to make your voice  action heard.  You will receive backlash there would be awkward moments but finding the sweet spot is all apart of the learning process. You remain alert to how others might feel but instead of the negativity you will learn to refocus and turn this into a joke lighten up the mood or create any device that works for you. Then you learn to understand that what this particular action was really harmless but now you cant helps those whove felt that were dominated and hurt by something so harmless.  I may apologize I will sympathize because I know I will not act high and mighty but to be honest theyve lost a little bid of my respect.  In the minds of an insecure person Harmless jokes gtgtgt Hurtful Jokes  Soft Concern gtgtgt Pity  Negative Nancy Confidence gtgtgt Arrogant  Sensitive Consideration gtgtgt Selfish  WTF? And the list goes on...In am not sure how many here would actually voice the agreement but this is a world where you will use others and be used by others.  Its inevitable.  It sucks if you think so itll be immoral if you think so if you feel like a tool than you will act like a tool.  But to be honest people dont want that shit most of the time it drains my energy to sit in a room full of insecure folks because of Fear itself and not the actual consequences that I need to watch out for what I say.  There are many schools of thoughts to group thinking vs individualism its on the same spectrum but the preferences within the shades of grey is what divides one thinking to another.  To the redpill at least I believe is strength in community by strength within the individual.  Not the other way around.Life is like a constantly sparring match.  You need to able to take hits and dish it out.  The only nice thing that you can ever do is show through your action and words that you wont hit so hard to disable someone.  those that are smart will see through that and stay in your proximity.  Other wise people will only see you as a punching bag not because you are but because you dont hit back because you only see contact as absolutely hostile and nothing amicable can come from these interactions. ,becomeaman,cqq190g,1,t5_2w1ya
4026639,0,t3_36i7om,gt TLDR How do men work through a significant loss without suppressing their emotions?Its about surrendering. You cant control any of this shit so dont try. Dont ignore it just realize it is what it is a part of life etc etc. Another way of saying it is Dont exert energy and hurt yourself on things you cannot control. Your grandmother is a danger to herself and you but Im not going to tell you how to handle that. Ill instead suggest that you find a focus in life. Something youre passionate about that you can occupy all of your time and all of your emotions into. Hopefully make you money so you can separate yourself from the situation. Use the fear and helpless feeling and channel it into this project. I find that it makes my own projectspassions so much more potent.Ultimately and Ill be shunned for this but youre not responsible for your parents or grandparents. They made choices in their lives that made them the way they are and youre not to blame for that.gtMy mother who is very religious was convinced it was sexual demons brought on their home because she assumed my grandfather used pornography.You have a series of mental health issues in your family. The goal is to separate yourself from these people obtain as much perspective from them as you can and make sure youve got the introspection throughout your life to avoid being like them. My mother is the same way and I know without her constant irrationalillogical nonsense I would have never gained perspective to see it for what it is. Thankfully I have a father that is a sceptic and was able to plant the right seeds at the right time so I was never dragged into that nonsense.Also if youre religious I dont mean to offend simply stating that there is a large difference between faith and makebelieve. Youd be surprised how common mental health issues are caused by pent up fear anger etc. People never deal with this stuff and it drives them MAD. But then again some people are not intelligent enough to even be able to do the introspection necessary to deal with it... I suggest a book named Taming your Outer Child. Shit helped give me perspective on not only what the book is for but my entire being Oh and lastly what doesnt kill you makes you stronger is so true. If you can get through this channel the emotions into something amazing that makes the world or you better youll realize that you can do this with everything in life.,becomeaman,crf9lx2,2,t5_2w1ya

4779654,0,t1_ctwr21l,You need to go further than that. You need to take the pussy off the pedestal.Picture your girl in your head. What tools does she have to rely on besides her looks? Personality? Intelligence? LOL. Its not her fault but God took away her chance to have those things when he created her to be physically attractive. Attractive women rarely have intelligence or personality simply because theyve never needed to develop them. Can you honestly look inside yourself and tell me that this woman has ANY value  any value at all  that isnt related to her appearance andor reproductive potential?Cuz let me tell you bro beauty is COMMON and reproductive potential is CHEAP. Take the pussy off the pedestal. Shes not a fairy princess. Shes just... A person. A person who youre giving a TON of power over you for absolutely no fuckin reason. Trust me bro she doesnt even want it she would like you more if she had ZERO power over you.TLDR Godspeed Faggot,becomeaman,ctx0lgi,3,t5_2w1ya
