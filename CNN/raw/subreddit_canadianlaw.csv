9799011,0,t3_5fiwnw,Here are some thoughts. Please take this with a grain of salt I am not licensed to practice law. I am a long time business owner though. Get a real lawyer involved if your corrective actions are rebuffed.As far as estate law there had to be a legal transfer of the business of some type. As for refusing the new owner I dont know if you can technically the business entity did not change just the owner. You might have a case for ending the lease if he is not willing to sign a new lease under the conditions of the original lease. Talk to a tenancy lawyer. If the insurance is under your name the money goes to you regardless if they are paying part of the premium due to leasecontract. They do not have the right to have a percentage of the return payout. They have the right to see what the premium is so they know they are not getting ripped off. It is your responsibility as the building owner to maintain the building. If there is no penalty stated for breaking the lease then there is no penalty. This does not mean that you are off the hook. I dont know Ontario tenancy law as far as if there are any base rules.I refer you to the Ontario Commercial Tenancies Website for more information. You are completely within your rights to stick to the lease rates for the water. He can complain to you but that is what was contracted.You renter is taking advantage of you. Late bill payment and the whole stamp thing is crap. You as the building owner set out when and how you wish to be paid. Usually the first business day of the month and asses penalties on payments later than  days. Late penalties are the usual method of dealing with tardy payment. You are not responsible for the costs of them paying there bills on time. Send a letter to them outlining the payment rules and schedule and the decisions you have made. Make it via registered mail and drop off a copy. Keep a strong record of responses that are verbally received. Have them make all requests in writing. Stop immediately enabling them by providing discounts. You are shooting yourself in the foot if this goes to court for it can be perceived by your renters that your are loose with a payment schedule under the current conditions. lastly check with your local business tenants association about the local Toronto rules then decide if you want them in the building or not. I hope this helps.,canadianlaw,dakxu5s,1,t5_2t2b1
