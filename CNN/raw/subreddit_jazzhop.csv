7692980,0,t3_4kmh1n,Pretty good though. However I would say that this music is quite flat. Indeed we can see the loop of the main musical pattern without huge changes. I know this is supposed to be jazzhop but we have a little bit of jazz a little bit of hop so a little bit of jazzhop not so much. Its kinda unfortunate. There is a lack of this little touch that Nujabes had the knowhow to make this song memorable.To conclude I would say that if this music is played anywhere I would enjoy listen to it but I wont listen to it on my own or only one time on a  months period.,jazzhop,d3gn4xj,1,t5_2t33r
