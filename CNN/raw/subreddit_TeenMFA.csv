Put them on to make sure both legs are equal lengths pin them at that height and then take them off again and secure the turn ups however you can. My first ones have safety pins as I said the newer ones are sewn. You could equally just slice them off at the length you want if you prefer a distressed edge. ,TeenMFA,cekw3hq,1,t5_2sjsv

It adds in my opinion an unneeded saturation to the fit and takes away the naturalness of it and it kind of gives the feel that youre deceiving the viewer as youre changing the way the photo looks to give the fit a different view.

1180729,0,t1_ci2d31k,I dont understand why youre hating everything fits him well which already gives him a leg up on most of the competition here the color scheme is nice and your comment about too many people posting the same exact fits here week after week just speaks to the fact that were all poor teenagers who dont necessarily have the money to drop on interesting new pieces week after week. I know that sometimes the lack of variety may be a bit upsetting but the thing is many of the kids here are a bit afraid to take a big step out of their comfort zones out of nowhere and so instead use subtle experimentation i.e. diy projects flamboyant prints and the like which I will admit can look like the same fits over and over if not examined carefully enough.I like to think of these Top of WAYWT threads as both places where we can showcase the fashion senses of our more avantgarde users i.e. Zane MAJhacks while at the same time showing basic but wellfitting outfits that could serve as inspiration for those just getting into fashion. In my opinion and in the opinion of those others all established tmfaers to boot who judged the fit and approved for it to be in this album said fit most definitely falls into the second category and does a good job in doing so.,TeenMFA,ci2g9vr,2,t5_2sjsv

You can make it artistic with a seemingly endless field of view or make it creepy like the Shining one with no escape. People rushing in and out of elevators with a long shutter speed can make a ghost like effect. Almost like the train scene from Spirited Away.Depending on high you are you can get a semidecent landscape shot from your window. Also fast shutter speed will allow you to photograph families.

4619941,0,t1_ctcrhhu,gt really? thats the BEST he can come up with? would it not be far more effective to address the causes of children being hungry rather than drain from the actual productive parts of society in order to fund some sort of government social project? or do youhe believe that choice in deodorant is the CAUSE of this poverty? plus do we really think these sorts of social programs are the best way to provide for those in need? i mean isnt social security the perfect illustration of Sanders idea youre talking about being completely ineffective? Now I am not Sanders but Ill try to see where his stance is. He probably sees hungry children most in lowincome families as those families are unable to support their childrens needs dietwise. So I would say being lowincome in Sanders opinion is a major factor as to why children who are hungry are hungry. I nor Sanders I would think do not believe that choice in deodorant is the cause of this poverty btw I think of the plethora of choices in deodorant is supposed to be a metaphor. But the variety we have is something that could be cut down through means of taxing for example for the social programs that will help hungry children. Now I do not know too much about social programs so I cant address the last part of your question. So maybe you have a point in terms of social programs maybe you dont but I cant really discuss that as I havent looked into that before.gt lol why does everyone always check the post history an call that out??? Well its that ancaps dont really have the best rep with regard to some other topics I would say.gt id wager we actually have quite similar ideals. we likely differ on how to achieve those societal ideals but just agreeing to disagree doesnt mean much or do much. First of all I want to give you credit. You know your stuff in terms of defending your ideology and you didnt go full on crazy downvoting or calling names as this is what many online debates fall into regardless of belief. And yeah I would agree we probably have similar society ideals but because we have our own different views on how to achieve those society ideals and because they are so wellrooted I doubt that either of us will be able to convince each other to believe what the other side believes you feel? Of course agreeing to disagree does not do much but what else can we do? ,TeenMFA,ctcx55y,1,t5_2sjsv

As previously replied to Velocirapture we are a British brand that actually manufactures high quality organic clothing in Britain this instantly gives us a clear scope and niche. We dont touch the fruit of the loom stuff. This is another brand that has everything manufactured in the UK and exploded massively in the last few years In an interview I read about them they said something like  of sales actually come from the UK the rest are predominantly US and Japan. And so shows there is great demand for British made products overseas due to the the perceptions that come with British tailoring and craftsmanship such as quality and luxury. ,TeenMFA,cw8wzwq,2,t5_2sjsv

5840376,0,t3_3v871y,For mostly everything you are looking for you can look at J Crew and J Crew Factory. However that isnt the only brand to look at as I am not sure about their joggers. You can check out sigh urban outfitters for joggers brands like publish.Basically Joggers HampM Uniqlo Joggers J Crew Urban Outfitters Publish Joggers moncler? Acne? idk those are just more expensive jogger style pants ik you should check them out to be sureFor anything other than joggers like the preppy shorts and crewnecks check out the two J Crew Brands or Uniqlo. Polo makes nice crewnecks too just more casual ones cause of the logo. Good luck hope i was helpful. This is just me procrastinating for my apush hw,TeenMFA,cxl77vs,6,t5_2sjsv

6055369,0,t1_cydcfty,Ive tried on the size down. Unfortunately due to my height and build this is the only one that fits me long enough in the chest. Ive got a bunch of shit that I need to get tailored this included. I really hate wearing ties and I never have a chance to dress up enough to require one. I tried a few things with it this morning and I found a patterned shirt with the sleeves rolled up to about my elbows. If you dont mind can I see some inspiration? Also I imagine it looked really dumb with Converse but my only other option is Stans but I think those would be worse. I probably need to invest in some boots,TeenMFA,cydcvmo,1,t5_2sjsv
