I constantly open new tabs and I still only have  running at absolute maximum usually  or less.Plus youve got to consider that RAM is one of the few linear upgrades well relatively linear in contemporary computers. Have x RAM and need more for your usage? Add another x of RAM at the same timings and ideally manufacturer and youre golden so long as you havent exceeded motherboard capacity in either total count or slots. Whereas with CPU you need to scrap or sell the old CPU and possibly motherboard as well which is a significant efficiency loss in most cases.,CabaloftheBuildsmiths,cf2j745,1,t5_2zmji

1677552,0,t1_cjqjtp0,True true I cant actually keep a good eye on my RAM usage while gaming but its never that high. Given most games arent CPU dependent. All I play is Dynasty Warriors and a bit of Street Fighter now though hahaHow accurate are PCPPs wattage estimates? I should know for the future.Ive noticed that myself which is why Silvers may not be an option. Theyre extremely scarce indeed but I dont know why. And thanks for the insight on the PSUs if you had to recommend a cost effective  Bronze PSUseries of PSUs what might they be?Fortune is not a blessing I have access to at this point in time but I sure hope to in the future. Speaking of your parts if they are indeed not test requested do you ever sell them at later dates? Hell I know its highly unlikely but if you ever need someone to buy some parts of of you if the price is right I might be the guy. Given its much more simple to sell locally and within the US but if the price is right paying for shipping probably wouldnt be a problem. Kind of a silly inquiry but I might as well test the waters.On another note have you anyone else on the sub or anyone you know had any experience with rhardwareswap? My thanks!Not difficult at all given I do prefer long term results than maximum performance in a short period of time. Im sure it wouldnt be that difficult to reduce the card to a near unusable but still believable mess within the last week D Im also not one to go to such measures though. I have a very obvious flaw in that Im reluctant to cause trouble for others even if they instigated my predicament. Lets say I purchase a product and it works well but not up to par with its expected performance. Chances are I wont move an itch and just deal with it. If a GPU is faulty Id most definitely demand compensation or something but Im not one to purposefully mangle a product hoping for compensation afterwards.

2420800,0,t1_cmagmh3,Ah I see. Apparently Turbo boost is just quick spurts of faster speeds. Strange. So ok if overclocking is basically useless at least in my case what is the point of it? Would there be much difference between a .GHz and .GHz i? Obviously Id want my GPU to be the bottleneck of my system and that EVGA Superclocked ACX .  can run at .GHz boost so thats not an issue and given that the only difference between the i I chose and the i you chose is speed and price I just want to know which would be more effective. Also the  is older would that be an issue in terms of warranties or anything? In general though it seems the  would be the better choice.I was researching RAM speed vs amount the other day where I learned that more RAM is better than faster RAM and it got me thinking if CPUs were similar if more coresthreads are better than higher speed. Is that right? Also is it better to have a faster processor with less RAM a slower processor with more RAM or a faster processor with more RAM?I got an iPad mini for my birthday and basically fell in love with Siri so I hope Cortana will be similar and shes voiced by motherfucking Jen Taylor!!. Also as a fan of Halo I like the idea of having Cortana as my personal assistant  I can be like a normallyclothed female version of Master Chief! hahaAlrighty Rosewill thingy you recommended it is. I just like the idea of modular because I dont like the idea of having to hide cables  Aesthetics are hardly a reason to sacrifice performance though. Unless... is the semimodular version of that PSU built the same?Thank you very much for answering my questions. I am learning a LOT.

Im honestly not trying to be argumentative here but I still fail to see what makes the K better or higher quality than the QFTK.

Plus then you have the option of coming back if you need help or asking them to account for upgrades and ensuring  the parts youre buying are the best you can get on your budget. For example the PSU included in that bundle is coming with the case as far as I see which isnt always too upgrade friendly so if you were to upgrade youd possibly have to swap it out and the SSD included is pretty average...Something like this thrown together in a few minutes the guys here probably can do better is probably going to be a little stronger for Dota although a little more expensive and lacking an SSD.Not sure if you know but the system youre looking atIve knocked together uses an integrated GPU not a dedicated card. An integrated GPU will handed Dota fine as the CPU is more important for Dota as its using the Source engine which is more dependent on the CPU. You save money now whilst only playing Dota by using the integrated GPU and if you want to upgrade in the future youre good to put a nice card in it and itll turn into a pretty nice system thatll handle newer titles on decent settings.EDIT neither of the builds come with an OS.

I found a desk but phone broke so I had to go deal with that and there went the afternoon. I left tomorrow open just in case I didnt finish today and Wednesday is ordering day.I havent had a chance to play competitive games besides TF If you can even call that competitive due to the fact that my poor laptop cant handle many things now after suffering a couple drops. I dont think Ill get into hardcore competitive though I never was a top scorer Im a decent teammate and I can hold my own but never in the big leagues just too outclassed. Therefore hz isnt mandatory simply because Im not skilled enough to utilize it to its fullest extent.I went with the s because they seemed to be a good starting point according to almost everybody. Just an outstanding amount of reviews saying theyre awesome but the one thing that I found weird was the whitebrown color scheme. Ive grown to like it but at first I was quite perturbed by it.Well then two rows of three monitors seems just a tad bit extreme. Im open to going p but good p monitors are hard to find and there just seems to be so much selection that its quite daunting and very intimidating because half the time Im not sure what Im reading and Im super scared that if I make the wrong decision Ill end up regretting it because a good monitor is what youre going to be staring at the entire time you know? and so I decided to just go with  p because theres more options so more chance to find what I want but p is very very tempting and aaahhhh please just take the wheeeeeeel.As you can see the monitor part freaks me out not just one decision but double which could have lasting consequences and sour me to the whole gaming experience.,CabaloftheBuildsmiths,cp9rl69,1,t5_2zmji

4131925,0,t1_crr2ki8,For what its worth the B isnt terrible but you can definitely get significant improvements by investing more in audio.At  for open circumaurals two options stand out. The first would be Sennheisers  HD   via Amazon  which is probably the single most common ish recommendation there days. It has a neutralish tuning with a mild lean toward the lower end giving a very smooth warm and fairly agreeable sound signature. The HD is quite wellrespected for its positional audio and soundstage as well making it a solid choice for gaming.There is however a second solid choice AudioTechnicas  ATHADx   via Amazon as well  The Air series has long been held up as one of the greats in terms of soundstage imaging and airiness and by all accounts the ADx follows in that tradition. The ADs typically lean bright that is boosted treble less bass opposite the warm lower treble more bassmids tuning of the HDx series so which you pick would likely come down to what youd like more of. Either should be quite neutral but at this price range theres no such thing as truly neutral everythings going to have its own characteristic coloration.,CabaloftheBuildsmiths,crr9hoc,1,t5_2zmji
4190183,0,t3_38qwsu,There are  things to consider when choosing a CPU supported instruction sets and cache per core count. This particular AMD CPU has the highest cache per core count from either camp. The only problem is that you like to use Dolphin. In that I recommend this build.In both listings I have  monitors. The Viewsonic is highly rated BUT it is a glossy screen which means you have to control the lighting in your room well because the screen reflects. If you dont like glossy screens then try out that new LG display. Its cheap IPS with features you might like. Most importantly both are PWM free so there is less eye strain.,CabaloftheBuildsmiths,crxvpjh,1,t5_2zmji

Id prefer a good quality non isolation over a mediocre isolation.. Yes I require a mic for gaming.

Its a pointless discussion because a. all of the points that are pertinent to the OP have been concededsettled which is all that matters in the first place and hes just decided to pick on offshoots that he thinks he can win an argument about. Its futile juvenile nonsense.b. He just wandwaives and makes excuses to exclude the meagre evidence that is available.Frame times are hard to measure and I certainly dont have the time or the equipment to do it myself. You have to read between the lines you look at the end result the game and see the constant stuttering and you combine that with drops in minimum frame rates across the board and the drop in average frame rate. As I said above but he ignored we wouldnt expect a drop in average frame rates at all if there were no issue. DRAM performance isnt like GPU VRAM performance its not like you hit a ceiling at some point and the performance tanks. The game just offloads the extra on to your HDDSDD and even the fastest of the latter are still orders of magnitude slower and with more latency than RAM. So we wouldnt expect any noticeable hit on the average frame rates of games that are suffering from stutter due to DRAM limitations. In fact VRAM sometimes does behave this way too but thats a different story. The fact that we do see some means that those games are catastrophically impacted like WatchDogs above that he handwaived away.His argument hinges on two things i his opinion that it isnt significant and that my benches dont matter and ii the lack of direct evidence of frame times is direct evidence of the absence of frame time issues which is quite obviously wrong.Its just pointless and stupid and its beginning to annoy me. So Im done. Sorry dude  good luck with this it seems like a good idea.,CabaloftheBuildsmiths,d035sjo,1,t5_2zmji

8215925,0,t1_d54jdgm,Sure. No SSD to keep it in budget. I asked OP whether or not they wanted one and it appears not. I dont believe OP told us which state theyre in so I cant calculate tax. In any case many online shops dont charge tax for some reason. When I looked I couldnt find a cheaper  on PCPP. I said to OP that they can get it cheaper used its up to them to decide whether or not they want to do that. I decided for  because OP will be gaming at a relatively high resolution so the s bandwidth and extra VRAM will help it here. Plus its better at DX which is starting to come out.
