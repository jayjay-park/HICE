8152220,0,t1_d4wgppc,It works for that texture but doesnt for any textures from EngineDebugMaterials like the sand MSandMasterVertPaint or the rainbow BoneWeightMaterial. When I put the EngineDebugMaterials.upk inside the rocket league folder it does nothing just the blue and white textures,RocketLeagueMods,d4wkprd,1,t5_3f8o8

9970225,0,t1_db73wjd,well hmm I can try. Its not hard to do but a little long. I will consider writing a tutorial its better to create a new post ?. I will do it with the standard boost first because I already have the files guessed. Actually what is taking time is figuring the sound files order because to do so I have to convert them to play them in VLC.  ,RocketLeagueMods,db75b98,1,t5_3f8o8

10731960,0,t3_5s9y09,Thanks all for all the help.So funny story time. Tried replacing a few boosts and while in car customization screen FPS were fine in game not much changed still random FPS drops even when nobody used the items I suspected were the culprit. So I went digging further. The two things that got my FPS back to normal were...  reverting to default settings and setting everything to performance in game with a few exceptions. Previously I changed many of the settings with a guide I found on reddit and it worked great at that time but it seems some update has broken that. reverted the overclocking on my GPU. Ran it overclocked for a few years now without problems but maybe its slowly dying.  I noticed that every time a FPS drop occured the fan started to blow harder. Cleaning it didnt help reverting to stock clocks did.Now I get constant  FPS again with occasional drops to  while using the proton boost.... go figure.,RocketLeagueMods,ddmx6ja,1,t5_3f8o8
