2430230,0,t1_cmc2kza,Their inaction spoke louder than words I think. My guess has always been that they were busy puzzling out the right words or response. What is he asking us to do exactly?!

3043725,0,t1_cod9too,Because its a teaching tool. If you have this stockpile of lessons that are bizarrely confusing and yet they pasted this long dont you think there is a reason? That perhaps these stories arent even real events but crafted specifically as a teaching tool? The what is the outcome of most of them? What the heck did I just read? Or I have no idea what this means but I have to solve it.I forget the source but it comes down to generating so much confusion and doubt in the student that they can do nothing but realize the fruitless nature of trying to make sense of things.,zensangha,codhc7x,1,t5_34jqx

7971833,0,t1_d4c3byl,..  Security professionals dont want people to have guns.  Its as simple as that.  If you havent seen The Nice Guys you should see it immediately.  Just as nobody could imagine the US without car manufacturers running things gun manufacturers are looking down the barrel of inevitable restrictions.As I said there is no argument where guns increase safety.  People who dont trust the police are backed by evidence of police misconduct... the solution is to disarm the majority of police not to  arm everybody else... The idea that there is an outcome that isnt based on people voting is misguided.  Guns nukes and invasive government have to be dealt with by voting.  The days of effective armed resistance in civilized countries are gone.  Idiots with firearms wont bring them back.Snowden is going to be seen as a hero in decades to come.  Its inevitable.  The government overstepped and got caught.  Leakers will always win maybe not individually but ideologically.,zensangha,d4c3y48,1,t5_34jqx
