3453336,0,t3_2zsfei,My Grandfather supported the dragons. My father supports the dragons. I remember being confused as a child when I saw the footy cards of the kid who lived a few houses away because I didnt realise that there were other teams that played our sport. I dont know how I thought the sport operated but I remember being astounded that anyone would bother to even try and compete against a club that had won  in a row my father may have not told me about other teams but he told me most days about  in a row.When I had children of my own I would hold lollies in my hand as I asked my children what team they supported. If they didnt support the Dragons no lollies for them. It may seem a low act but my family supports the Dragons and any child of mine that wants to break that tradition can discuss it with their case worker.Why do I say this? I say it because the Dragons have more supporters across our nation than any other club. In our glory years our team would be taken to a country town on a bus and just before the bus reached the town it would pull over to the side of the road where the players would put on their kit. The bus would then then come into town where our players would step off and meet the locals and initiate relationships between people and players that would last from father to son and then grandson and in the case of our family into a fourth generation with no sign of the family support of the red V dying in the next few generations.I accept that the view of those on the hill must be acknowledged and accepted but those on the hill must also acknowledge that while they are the face of our supporters many supporters live too far away to attend home games. I can only attend those games played in Newcastle and eventually getting to my point I dont support the Oust Doust campaign and I detest any moves against Mary.I know that there is a lot of discontent against those who run our club in the suburbs around Jubilee and I love the passion of those who are in a position to attend our games but I would love for those passionate people to take a step back and acknowledge that we are supporters of a national not suburban club and ask themselves how many of our clubs problems are caused by factors outside the salary cap and what percentage of our nations supporters want administrative change.I know very little about Doust besides him delivering a premiership but know nothing about any contenders for his job and until I do I cant support any oust campaign. Anyone who wants Mary out needs to look more closely at the players. He has done well with the team he is coaching.,NRLdragons,cplwnmg,2,t5_2vxiv

7172709,0,t1_d1tgby4,E.g. McCrone kicking for Frizell when there was a  on  situation to the right. Didnt even look up or see the possibility. It was already planned in his head and there was no other option. I think this is where you separate the good players with the great players. A Cooper Cronk JT or Milford would have seen the opportunity McCrone is not and never has been at that level. He is a good player but not a great one.  We seem to just go through our play book in attack and dont play what is infront of us.,NRLdragons,d1tgwvi,3,t5_2vxiv
