They were arguing and she says she feared for her life but doesnt mention any abuse.Also according to her husband she closed her eyes and pulled the trigger so maybe she is a bad shot or maybe she closed her eyes and missed either way it was reckless and her child was in the residence at the same time. It really does seem like a battered woman finally trying to make an attempt at standing her ground to show that he couldnt control her anymore. That is a cute idea but really a battered woman who was living seperate of her abuser wasnt she already out from under his control? Perhaps some forethought and planning like calling the cops when you plan to enter your abusive husbands house would be a good idea but no she goes there against a court order argues goes gets her gun then closes her eyes and fires recklessly at someone.You can try and frame this as some empowering feminist trip but really it is a story of a woman who made wrong decision after wrong decision and is trying to play off of sympathy to get no punishment for her reckless actionsLink to my source ,WTF_Florida,cfu81ok,3,t5_2qzyf
