745821,0,t1_cgoolt7,Yes I really liked the neighborhood and its all a downhill walk through Calle Segovia when you miss the last Metro. I stayed there two times in two apartment buildings that someone told we were part of a complex Franco built for some of his soldiers. I dont know if that story was true but the walls were so thin you could hear everything going on to the sides and above and below. Glad to hear its not the case with other buildings there. I remember people protesting the sewage leak in the station. I usually was going to the city center and the buses nearby went straight to Plaza Mayor. Yes Principe Pio looked like a nice place and Ill have a closer look there per your recommendation.,Madrid,cgp21du,1,t5_2si9y

1686329,0,t3_2dolzt,Private Lessons are the goto for most English teachers around here.  Mostly people I know got them through personal connections  friends of teachers at their school recommendations from previous studentstutors etc.  Theres a pretty high demand you shouldnt have any trouble finding some.  There are also Facebook groups for most of the programs where people will occasionally post private lesson opportunities.,Madrid,cjrq5jv,3,t5_2si9y

2606116,0,t3_2p4cb3,I went solo too and the best advice I can give you is to go to language exchanges my personal favourite is MadridBabel which I frequented so actively they eventually made me part of the staff. Everybody goes there to meet people and speak nobody will tell you anything if your spanish is less than stellar or nonexistent as mine was when I started out and most people can speak at least some level of English which is not necessarily the case in other social events. The events are totally free and drinking isnt mandatory so they neednt cost you anything if youre not in a spending mood. There are exchanges almost every day monday is the only day in which I wasnt able to find any and provided you have at least a modicum of social skills youll get invited to the continuation of the evening in other places by people youve known since all of two hours.Couchsurfing events are great too you dont need to be an actual couchsurfing member to go though there arent really any reasons not to open a free account and they are by definition very internationalfriendly so language is usually not much of a problem.,Madrid,cmyr980,1,t5_2si9y

When you go to get on a rollercoaster theyll have a little locker on the other side of the platform so you just go put your stuff away and then take your seat!The nice thing I noticed was that most of their rides have two coasters running at once and the lockers are set on timersmeaning that they wont open until YOUR coaster returns to the platform.

11542925,0,t3_64pb2l,As some have said finding a flat can be tough so plan to spend a week at least of solid hunting before you find a place once you get here. If you share a flat your rent shouldnt be more than . Youll pay one months rent as a finders fee and another months rent as deposit.I have a bunch of friends in Madrids auxiliar program and theyre just fine on month. Teaching English privately will earn you about hour so that can add up pretty quickly.If youre under  for month you can get unlimited transportation anywhere in the Comunidad de Madrid ie the state of Madrid if youre from the US not just the City proper with the joven abono. Thats important because some programs dont tell you where youll work until you get here. Some friends have to travel  minutes each way because they want to live in the city but they work in some small city outside Madrid. Otherwise unlimited transportation is month.You usually work  days for   hours a day.No one is in the city during the month of August so flat hunting then can be easier or harder if the real estate agents are on vacation!.If you are even barely considering the move DO IT! Its definitely daunting but I consider moving to Madrid as the best single thing Ive done with my life. Aside from all the great culturefoodopportunities that the city has to offer its a wonderful opportunity to learn about the world and yourself. Plus doing things that scares you is the best way to grow.Cheers!,Madrid,dg4e4os,2,t5_2si9y
