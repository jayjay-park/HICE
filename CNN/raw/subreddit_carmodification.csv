5305539,0,t1_cvplr73,Thats a good point as well... While you may find coilovers there are other things to take in mind such as installation experience with adjustments any damages that may occur from installationdefects etc.Just my  cents from personal experience going cheap on coilovers without the time and experience to dedicate towards adjusting makes driving a back breaking hell of a time.,carmodification,cvpuecs,3,t5_2x6wj
