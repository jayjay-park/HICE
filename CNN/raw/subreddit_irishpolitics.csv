I fixed up and spent four years in DCU never got a degree and cost the state the guts of thirteen grand without having to repay a cent. If I was paying towards it I would have either worked harder or worked for a while before deciding on what I wanted to do.,irishpolitics,czmt1vp,2,t5_2sgbm

6485262,0,t3_44gv2m,I thought that Eamon Ryan had moved in with RT.  The amount of airtime that he gets is astonishing considering his current standing. Hes the leader of a party with no TDs no senators and whose overall share of the vote in opinion polls tends to be in or around the margin of error.  In   out of the  outgoing Green TDs got so few votes that they lost their deposits.And he still thinks he deserves a place at the table?  On your bike Eamon.,irishpolitics,czq4he7,2,t5_2sgbm

9806883,0,t3_5ffl73, In terms of national security and maintaining our freedom of action an independent Scotland would be to to our advantage. An independent Wales would also  increase our geopolitical power by a considerable amount in the long run ditto for a United Ireland. Oil isnt going to go back up and will likely decline further in the long run leaving a huge hole in an independent Scotlands budget. How will they afford low Corpo tax? The SNP will get stale sooner or later and are already in danger of getting nibbled at by leftwing republican  parties like the Scottish Greens.  Like SF eating into FF except the SNP are fragmenting far quicker than FF did. This leaves less room for probusiness policies. Secession will take a long time since Sturgeon would have to diversify enough from rUK to make joining the EU economically viable that will take a while.,irishpolitics,dalwpy9,1,t5_2sgbm

10522554,0,t3_5qnhsc,gtBy allowing ourselves to be persuaded that retention of the CTA is a major policy objective for us we would not only become unpaid agents for the protection of Britains bordersIts in the headline and he says it but theres no explanation or attempt to explain how this is true.  Unless hes implying that well have to get UK sanction to issue visas to Ireland which I dont see as a reasonable situation.gtWould there be any great change in practice if the CTA ceased to exist?Yes thousands of people on both sides of the border would have their lives disrupted especially those who work one side and live the other side of it.  ,irishpolitics,dd0ufp3,2,t5_2sgbm
11103518,0,t1_deqk9ma,Or its been spoken of as a single entity because its the simplest umbrella term and separating all religion from state is the topic so hardly worth mentioning every little organisation entity or sect as it doesnt matter Also Ive no idea why feminists are being mentioned?

11212856,0,t1_df2pukv,Its the same thing. I just dont express it in a politician speak.  The SNP say to the Scottish that they are being forced out of Europe by the English yet didnt campaign that way during the Referendum.  They give the impression that if they secede from the UK that they are guaranteed a place in the EU and it aint necessarily so . Politicians in Spain and other countries do not look favourably on secessionist movements as they have them themselves.  The SNP s spin about being able to stay in the EU is just not true . It would have to join all over again and join the queue.  There is no guarantee that its application would be accepted . What makes you think that the Scottish are that popular that they would be allowed to join ??And on Ireland  would you pay  or  a year or more  to live in a unified Ireland?  How much would you pay ? ,irishpolitics,df2yq3p,1,t5_2sgbm
