I graduated with a decent amount of debt  k but nothing thats insurmountable given the job I now have.I didnt want to establish instate residency because it would either have lengthened my time in school or caused me to take larger course loads other semesters. I understand why people do it though.,uiowa,cv18w1j,1,t5_2rflf

Dont worrying about comparing your building to any others because Slater will come up short every time. Just make sure your room is everything you want it to be and try to make good friends with everyone on your floor that you can. Best of luck. ,uiowa,d3wad16,2,t5_2rflf
