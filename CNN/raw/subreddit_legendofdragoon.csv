1061148,0,t1_chokx53,Its a pretty intense grind he gets GoWD at level  I think on top of that you need to have all additions done atleast  times which shouldnt be that hard for spinning cane and if you can pull it off frequently rod typhoon should be near  by the time you get GoWD without even grinding very hard. However unlocking Flower storm with lavitz as mentioned by ulavitzzz is incredibly useful for the first  discs as well as the first half of the third. Having Flower storm before you get Albert means that when you do get albert you already have an addition doing  dmg and giving  SP making him the strongest dmg in the game until you unlock another persons Master Add.,legendofdragoon,chownsx,1,t5_2u98t

6451197,0,t1_czminjh,I love that ya Ive been fighting with whether or not its hollow for a while. Because her normal Rapier is definitely not hollow. But Dragoon forms do up the ante on everything. However if it were hollow Id think itd be the tip that was hollow not necessarily the hilt.. BUT if it is then ya gotta keep that hollow too. ,legendofdragoon,czmlfgf,2,t5_2u98t

Although Im almost positive you can download the app for apple externally and then put it on you Ipad. Google it man. Youtube should have a video on what you want to do.,legendofdragoon,d4cgj45,1,t5_2u98t
