237906,0,t3_1wtmmu,Hi  mids woman who commutes to work and back  of the year.  Vancouver is hilly but thankfully not to a Streets of San Francisco level.  My daily driver is a mids norco cromoly ATB with street tires full fenders rear rack speed style comfort handlebars Brooks BS and lights.  Total cost to buy a good older bike and have a complete overhaul and install my accessories was in your suggested price range.  These are my observations on my setup       Comfort handlebars  Its really easy to see whats happening around me.  I find Im more relaxed and the ride is far more enjoyable.  If I need or want to I can pedal just as fast as when I had a flat bar.  I was experiencing burning wrists before the swap and the swap completely eliminated this..  I think its due to the more natural grip position of cruiser bars.      Brooks seats are worth the money.  Theyre Satan on your own seat until theyve molded to it but after that they are perfect.  Having said that if the existing seat is comfy keep it.     Lights.  Dont skimp..  these are your best defense against a driver not seeing you.  Ive had numerous occasions as a reasonably prudent driver where Ive completely missed spotting cyclists..  lights would very much have helped me spot them.  Reflector strips around your ankles are nowhere near as effective.   Ill be buying a roadoriented bike later this year and can tell you that Im leaning toward a higherend credit card touring type bike for several reasons    .  There are no races in my future.  I want a bike I can enjoy myself to my fullest on.  I find modern STI shifting much more confidenceinspiring than downtube shifters but bar end shifters are okay too.    .  Tires for lessthanideal pavement andor wellmaintained gravel paths so I am not limited to roadways.    .  Gearing specced more towards lowrange ease of pedaling up hills vs power output.    I know this is significantly higher than your suggested price point..  Ive discovered a love of riding longer and longer distances and this is the type of bike I know I want for me.  Ive been able to save up for it with all the gas money Ive been pocketing by bike commuting.  Ive ruled out cyclocross bikes because the geometry always feels too sporty in comparison to touring bikes but I dont need the NASAlevel reliability of a touring bike.  One last thing..  just a personal preference but my hands seem to prefer the shifting of campy vs shimano or sram.  Cant tell you why.  Thats all for now.  I suggest showing my post to your girlfriend and geting her feedback..  itll help you two figure out her needs and wants.  Cheers!Edit  clarity and spelling,whichbike,cf5eqlx,2,t5_2s37j

Commuters and hybrids can be more comfortable if youre not expecting to go for longer rides say  miles. And that way you can more easily attach a rack so youre not carrying a laptop in a backpack.

2543145,0,t1_cmqb4mh,Ooh oh yeah electrics going to help even less even really fancy expensive electric bikes have ranges not much upward of  miles on power.Just dont push yourself too hard especially at the start and ask your doctor about recommendations like bringing along a rescue inhaler or something.  So far as Ive ever heard asthma isnt supposed to keep you from doing in appropriate intensity almost any exercise short of maybe scuba or something extreme and even then I dont know.  I used to have some exerciseinduced asthma when I was starting to train more heavily.  It took me longer than it should have to realize I should just drop my average speed a bit for a while and improve my base fitness before my body lungs especially would let me put out that effort.  Probably different for nonexercise induced but my understanding is that the principle is the same perhaps with a different magnitude.Is this the  range?  What bicycle do you already have?  At that price range used is a really good bet as you can find some pretty damn nice stuff thats only been used  years often lightly and Florida has a pretty cheap used bike market AFAIK from helping someone else look for a bike there.  Probably look for models like the Trek series Giant Defy Cannondale Synapse Specialized Secteur and comparable models from other brands like Felt Fuji Diamondback etc...

4266853,0,t1_cs6kj8d,Ok so here is the standard spielI would rather race on an aluminum frame with good components. The high end aluminumentry level carbon crossover point is more about ride than stiffness or weight. Entry carbon will smooth out the ride but thats about it. The Evo and CAAD are very similar in geometry so they should handle almost identically.As for components  is a huge step above . The new brakes are incredible better shift feel the crank is almost Ultegra level much closer than in previous iterations and you get that th gear wider gearing but without sacrificing good spacing between ratios which is probably future proof for a decade or so.So if you were intent on racing I would steer you towards the CAAD but if youre on the fence and plan on riding just for pleasure in the foreseeable future Id say it is .

4451474,0,t3_3c2jds,The upper end of your budget is bordering on being too high used with your requirements in mind unless you find a higher end bike a few years old or some kind of classic vintage bike. I would expect to pay  unless you have to have one of the latest bikes. Bikes like the LHT and Space Horse mostly use the same technology as  years ago or at least stuff compatible and comparable so for me theres not a lot of point especially if you dont want brifters the only difference will be newer bikes will be more likely to have a higher number of gears but touring bikes have always had a wide range of gears so its not as much as an issue as it sees.gtIt will be left in the rain a fair amount. Dont know if this is a huge factorDepends if it gets dried out  if it gets wet outside work but you bring it inside your dryheated place overnight and maintain it well it doesnt matter. If you store a bike out in the open in your yard or put it away wet in a cold damp shed dont bother doing maintenance it will be very bad for the bike.gt  but I guess I either want a bike that wont get rusty or one thats cheap enough that I wont mind getting rusty over time.A bike that wont get rusty is one that doesnt have any steel parts. All but the most expensive bikes have mostly steel bolts. Steel spokes and steel chain sprockets and chainrings are standard except for ultra exotic stuff that wouldnt be durable enough for touring.gtShould have a comfy seat less important than the above as I can always upgrade the seatWhat do you mean by comfy seat?gtDownstem shifters for ease of maintenance again I can swap them out if need beGood quality integrated shifters  or better are very reliable and low maintenance. The Ultegras on my road bike Ive ridden s of km and they work exactly the same as when I bought them. Ive never needed to lube them whereas I have lubed the dowtube shifters on my vintage bike a couple of times  theyre more exposed to the weather.The reason some people spec downtube shifters for touring is they are way easier to repairbodge if they break. But shifters breaking would only be a major issue if you were in the third world or many days from civilization. As long as you have a pair of pliers that can cut inner gear wire which you should be carrying touring its possible to manually set the cable independent of the shifter into a particular gear that will get you to your destination and a bike shop.Edit  Whats with the downvote?,whichbike,csrskgt,2,t5_2s37j
4481070,0,t3_3cdgq3,Have a look on eBay you probably want something like a town bike or a hybrid maybe a mountain bike. Town bikes are the prettiest nice colours baskets that sort of thing and are good on roads and trails but not so good on anything more than that really. The flatter the better for town bikes. Think Victorian ladies going for a nice gentle country ride sort of thing. They are also pretty heavy and sturdy so take that into consideration for storage purposes. As for hybrids and mountain bikes these are more aimed at anything more than what Ive said above. You can pick up a mountain bike pretty cheap on eBay but look at any damage it might have if anything needs replacing general maintenance. Mountain bikes dont look the nicest imo but they are probably the best for what you want. Also on a town bike you sit up straight whereas on a mountain bike you lean forwards dunno if that matters? Alsooooo as long as you can ride a bike it should all come back to you you never forget how to ride a bike. You could maybe research bike maintenance classes or classes that teach you the basics of bike road safety. TlDr probably best with a mountain bike but town bikes are the prettiest.

Nobody has ball bearings falling out of their bike if they do even the most baseline maintenance and the locknutcone quality on e.g. that  hubset are quite good and unlikely to have that problem.  Trying to compare that to  hubsets isnt a fair comparison anyway.You still do have to maintain cartridge bearings though not with as high a frequency but when you do have to maintain them it is a more involved process.  And on top of that getting ball bearings is trivially easy whereas getting the correct cartridge can be a pain.Wheelsmith has a vested interest in marketing and the fact that they unequivocally declare certain hubs as the best invalidates some of their other claims.It depends on peoples needs.

6429538,0,t3_43qvh1,gtIm really itching to ride everyday but the straight handle bars just murder my wrist and cause my hands to fall asleep after about  minutes of riding.Thats not really normal to have problems that fast unless youve developed a strain injury. I can think of three things that would cause those symptoms for me The bars are ones that are completely straight without any rearward sweep  see diagram I cant tolerate handlebars that dont have any sweep even for short distances. The bars are set up with that rearward sweep pointed in the wrong direction straight down at the ground seems particularly common in badly set up bikes Ive seen  this is like having no sweep but even worse.  Those Ergonstyle grips are set at the wrong angle or not suitable for your hands. I dont like them and prefer soft round grips but they should still be OK for longer than  minutes unless theyre set up wrong.You could also set up this this bike to allow more hand positions without switching to drop bars or get a new bike with drop bars. It would for sure not be worth the conversion to drop bars  you would spend more than the bike is worth. Road bikes cost a fair bit more than hybrids to get similar quality though you could always look at used bikes.I ride drop bar bikes mostly with longer rides but I have a flat bar bike I do cycle touring on which I modified to add more hand positions.You could look at adding bar ends  they give a couple of extra hand positions especially with some bar tape wrapped round the junction with the bar. Trekking bars are bars with bar ends built in and there are other types of bar like those suggested by uzedmartinez ,whichbike,czkcoz4,2,t5_2s37j

6717589,0,t1_d0d31j1,Hey thanks for the comments. Was out all day today. Youre absolutely right I need to have been changing my chain more often. Its not so much that Ive only done two chains on my cassette but that I dont follow up on maintenance well enough after xyz amount of kilometers so as a result I ride the chain well past its life span and that takes a toll on the teeth. Similarly since the chain is run through the wet and gets a fair amount of debrissalt build up in the winter it chews the components a lot more. I shouldve also been more rigorous about cleaning things off with a hot water spray during the winter. The bike has seen   km but only two chains and two cassettes as I replaced them together. They also see a fair amount of wear grinding away at my hill climbs. Thats why Im assuming there will probably be more wear on parts that havent been well maintained by me. The parts are cheap so I usually let the shop use what they have or buy locally at MEC. For example the  USD example you gave would be . CAD before tax and import fees. It looks like the same M is available here but for . I believe the M is whats on the bike now and what Id probably wind up replacing it with at  unless I was upgrading to something similar like what youve suggested.The SRAM cassette you have here looks great thanks! I didnt really think about mixing brands. The local price here at MEC for the PG is  which is slightly cheaper than replacing the cassette with another HG Does lose the t but well it doesnt see much use anyway. What did have me looking at upgrading was various chain wear tests folks have done with some of the new higher end parts. There was considerably more life in the new  speeds versus the  for example on bikerumors review So if I had one nicer bike for summer and this fella for winter the wear wouldnt be as bad and I wouldnt have dead chains eating the teeth like I have been.Anyway youre bang on about the chain tool thats definitely something I should pick up whether or not I have to replace the entire drivetrain or not. Maybe Ill bring the bike to the shop and have them take a look at the bottom bracket bearings and crank for me and see what they think. Im sure I could replace a chain but not so sure about replacing more involved parts with torque required. ,whichbike,d0e5nno,1,t5_2s37j

I have ridden s even s but they are a little big for me and feel stretched out.So I think that the bikes you are interested in should be narrowed down to the ones that come in larger sizes. Everyone is different and maybe you would prefer a  sized bike but I dont think so. Especially if you are going to have to special order and hope it fits.Road bike drop bars will allow a higher top speed than a hybrid. Drop bars also allow you to change hand positions on longer rides avoiding fatigue. Clipless pedals also add some efficiency. But I would advise against road style shoes and pedals.

You can do lt miles on pretty much anything and not really feel any downsides so you could probably make do with a nice hardtail MTB or something like that. But if its a bit longer you might feel the benefits of something more efficient on the road. Maybe a hybrid road bike or adventuregravel bike. The latter are often touted as a do it all sort of bike theyre almost as fast on the road as a normal road bike but theyre capable of handling a lot of uneven off road surfaces very well. Without suspension though they might not cope too well with the sorts of shocks and jumps you might want to put them through.Im hesitant to suggest getting two bikes to start off with. It would be a good fit for some drastically different uses and you could get a nice hardtail with rockshox forks and everything around  and a decent entry level road bike around  but often you find that when people buy two bikes at once one gets used all the time and the other just sits in storage gathering dust. If you were to go down that route Id say to just get the one to start out with and bear in mind that another is an option if you feel the need.,whichbike,d3zg5pp,2,t5_2s37j

10307506,0,t3_5ndvwk,While the components on this bike are the minimum I would recommend buying from Amazon is a bad choice in most cases. First your inexperience increases the chance that you will get a bike that is the wrong size. Second the bike will come partially assembled. Forcing you to pay someone to assemble and tune it. By the time you do this you could get the same quality bike for the same price from a local bike shop.Drop bar road bikes start at around . This would be equal or better than the Amazon bike you were considering.While seat comfort can be a major issue the correct size and the best quality components you can afford are the two most important things. If you cant swing the cost of a new entry level bike like the Contend I would recommend getting a good low mile used bike.

11597271,0,t3_65i6k6,If youre not used to a road bike already then Id probably suggest an endurance geometry or at least something thats not too aggressive. Even for lower category racing itll be perfectly fine and its better if youre comfortable enough to put out the power rather than struggling to get as aerodynamic as possible. Theres lots you can do to get more aero on an endurance bike too just lowering the stem will make a big difference over time.Theres still a lot of debate about high end aluminium vs low end carbon ultimately itll be up to you to make that call based on test rides. Could also be worth considering that aluminium frames are much more likely to come with things like rack mounts if you wanted the option to use the bike for commuting or light touring with slightly wider tyres. is a good shout but I wouldnt discount a good bike with Tiagra   its more or less the same groupset just with  speed rather than  and some slightly different materials.Theres a bit of a push towards disc brakes on road bikes in this sort of budget. Up to you how you feel about them but Id check the regulations for the races or events you think you might want to get involved in  sometimes theyre not allowed.From the bigger manufacturers you could be looking at something like a Trek Domane Giant Defy Advanced Specialized Allez E Cannondale Synapse.

You should get carbon fork blades and a carbon seatpost that will make the ride comfortable. You should be able to get mechanical disc brakes that will work in savage conditions. With gearing I would go for compact  chainrings and t cassette. If there are bad roads in your area I would consider a little more relaxed geometry bike with mm tires. This should make you more comfortable and it could even make u faster on poor road surfaces. So Giant Contend Cannondale Synapse etc..... Or try looking at gravel bikes if speed isnt your priority. They should provide even more comfort and should be suitable for more unpaved roads. ,whichbike,dgtm3q8,2,t5_2s37j
