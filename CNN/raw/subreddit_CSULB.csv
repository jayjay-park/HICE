Not sure how he teaches  but a run down of my  wasWeekly readings and a  pg summary that he never read I barely wrote about the readings and got  on them all.x Midterms that were take home and also barely graded. I got  on each of themx take home final that was also simplex homework assignments that were straight from the book and while not easy they werent difficult.Lectures that for the most part were not relevant to his assigned readings and only a little relevant to his homework and midtermsTLDR You wont learn jack shit and I have no clue if its passable since he hasnt taught it much.,CSULB,cfekx28,1,t5_2sawc

Sports and FratsSororities too if youre into that. If youll be an incoming Freshmen its also a lot easier as they tend to group you guys together for GE classes so youll be seeing a lot of the same people.

Just be wary of the West side of Long Beach as it is a bit ghetto.As for offcampus housing there are a lot of apartment blocks within a km distance all of which have a bus stop close by that you can use to get to campus. Im not sure about other apartments in regard to how pleasant they are but I know for certain Beverly Plaza  minute bus ride is decent.

One lived off campus the other two on campus. If youre under  years old Belmont isnt worth it in my opinion. Still a nice area you just wont enjoy what it has to offer. I guess the night life here is nothing in comparison and public transportation is avalible but you could be waiting a while. Id worry more about having a bike or a means of transportation and putting yourself out there and being active. If you wanna try lacrosse shoot me a message were always willing to bring in New people. If you liked it you would be able to go back to England and hold your own since the US and Canada have the most skill. Its a developing sport. ,CSULB,cqglbzy,1,t5_2sawc

History is an awesome department and is really one of the hidden gems at CSULB. Lots of award winning historians doing great work including the credential people.

Some pros I get paid enough to have some fun on the side and am able to support myself. I am lucky and get enough fafsa to pay for my schooling expenses but I have other things to pay like my car etc. I also learned some valuable skills like managing my time better. Some cons preparing for tests can be a lot more stressful and my social life isnt the greatest compared to a lot of other people that I know.My advice do what you need to in order to get by but if you think that it isnt something that you can handle then I would  make school the number  priority.
