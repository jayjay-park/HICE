1979545,0,t3_2hcany,Great song love how it builds up to that last chorus with the solo. Some of the best guitar work on the debut but probably just outside my top  for the album Thats less cause this songs bad and more because the debut is really fucking good though.,CageTheElephant,ckrqids,3,t5_2sgfo

5495660,0,t3_3qae8z,Super exited for the album especially because its produced by Dan Auerback of The Black Keys however the art is freaking me out a little bit. I guarantee if anyone looked over my laptop they would think to themselves wtf is he listening to?!?!,CageTheElephant,cwe4fbj,1,t5_2sgfo
5529044,0,t3_3qqyhk,Im kind of disappointed. This is just a black keys song covered by CTE. Im hoping the rest of the album isnt like this.My favourite thing about CTE was how out there the vocals were. The lyrics were deep and Matts voice really stood out. This song is nothing like that.Its not bad dont get me wrong but its just not as good as it couldve been. Its the type of song that I wouldnt skip over but I wouldnt skip other songs to get to it. Sorry if I come off like a dick but its just my opinion yours may differ.,CageTheElephant,cwidu5a,2,t5_2sgfo

6934803,0,t3_4aoexx,It depends how old your daughter is what shes like. I would say she will probably be fine as the pushing and shoving are not unreasonable. Ive been to five shows and never had a violent experience just crowd surfing and a general pushing forward of the whole crowd.
