4196138,0,t1_cryjufz,It is still breakfast time hereYeah your right about the personalized advice there is way too many you guys have probably seen this before but this is different because....I wear a hat! posts.I think it is a circular thing since a lot of people on the sub seem to think that pointing the OP in the right direction to solve his subnet query and wishing him luck is rude.

9322690,0,t1_d8xn01r,So many of these people dont even know what a product data sheet is and tend to be unwilling to learn.  Everybody seems to want knowledge spoon fed to them these days.  We have the lowquality rule to leverage as a tool to clear out the noise.  ,innernetworking,d8xpwpe,2,t5_387i3
