11456184,0,t1_dfujmgj,Im personally just not motivated enough to bother. I save a bunch of my shitty salary for the day when I move back to the US to live out my life as a wage slave. Props to you though you know what you want and need and have gone after it. Me I know what I want which is not having to work all that much so Im getting it now. Wont be the case later but life always keeps on changing no matter how much I bitch and moan about it. tbh Ive hit that point where a change in lifestyle would be good for me too much of a good thing ends up being a bad thing. ,TEFLSHIT,dfujtli,3,t5_3id33
