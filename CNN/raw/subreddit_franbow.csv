10246230,0,t1_dc4v1fb,Hey mate thanks so much for giving it a try and sticking with it. Im currently working on Ponderabilia  and I have hopes of making things a LOT more understandable and less frustrating.  little spoiler Nikee is Pissed off ...I love that you gave it a go played it through and actually went as far as to recognize both endings. Its a free game and having people enjoy it is very rewarding to me. Im wondering if theres something I could do to make the game clearer and more accessible for players? Theres a logic to each element in the game but I understand things feeling complicated. ,franbow,dc5gtif,2,t5_39qm9
