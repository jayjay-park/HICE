9196447,0,t1_d8gjryr,Ok Ive listened to the tape a couple of times in a row and its honestly really hard to tell. The vocals are really unintelligible but I think its in English. Here someone has put it on Youtube what do you reckon? ,TapeKvlt,d8hpu3h,1,t5_3by65
9355685,0,t1_d91vj64,I was back and forth on it. I have a digital copy of the album but I was hoping that you had something that stuck out to you. Oh well.,TapeKvlt,d91wfgu,1,t5_3by65

10547811,0,t1_dd3pfp2,Well admittedly they were expensive but they were new releases as well. If I dont rmb wrongly the guy with the Burzum tapes is there every year with them and never manages to sell them. That price is crazy tbh.,TapeKvlt,dd3pnlh,2,t5_3by65
