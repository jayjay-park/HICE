10484091,0,t1_dcwfhmq,She was a certifiable dingbat.  She always had some sort of halfassed excuse as to why something did or didnt happen either at work or home.  Her kid sounded like a nightmare from go.  We heard tales weekly about her little angel flinging a brand new ipad down the stairs or breaking plates.  No punishment because shes only  she doesnt understand what shes doing.She stayed because she was cute the big bosses liked staring at her and she liked it because then they wouldnt look in the top drawer of her desk to see  months worth of charts piled up she hadnt done.,talesfromthejob,dcwhaww,7,t5_2ttfz
10712251,0,t3_5t1kpg,Youre a security guard? Quit. You put up with enough garbage throughout your day to have to deal with shitty office politics. Remember you have to work with these people. Now youre that guy. Also as a guard for the past  years kill me please working with an even mildly attractive woman in a notoriously malecentric job is the worst. You will never be taken seriously she will always win every fight. This comes from personal experience my friend. Find your exit and take it. ,talesfromthejob,ddkvzy4,2,t5_2ttfz

I worked in retail for many years and there was vacation blackout from November to February. That was our busy season and we needed all hands on deck. As an aside great username. Go Bayern! ,talesfromthejob,dg78v10,1,t5_2ttfz
