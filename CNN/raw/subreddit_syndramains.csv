4096322,0,t1_crn78j6,Shes great for running a kill lane but hella risky if their support wasnt picked. The main issues youll run into is either A sustain lanes or B hyperaggro ones. Its very much the same issues Veigar support runs into basically.Her skill cap is pretty high for mid lane yeah. The Q nerf a few patches back have really put a cramp into her lane bullying though. Youll basically fight three things flaskpot spam hexdrinker ADs or nonfighting perma roamers. The first one out right ignores you through health spam the second is incredibly difficult to kill because of how Hexdrinker works and the third is just annoying.If you actually get to fight someone straight up she can work wonders.,syndramains,crn7fqt,1,t5_3831v

4641367,0,t3_3egqpz,Thanks for the guide! Also Id like to know more information on Syndra vs Diana since Diana is becoming more popular and I dont know how to counter her with Syndra. I know you can bully her pre but once she gets  and gets an Abyssal Septer its super hard at least for me.,syndramains,ctflzzh,1,t5_3831v

7231363,0,t1_d204zya,roughlyMake passive happen at all levels special effect at .Q damage  to champs scales with rank. At  bigger size or longer sphere durationW Slow  scales with rank Slow duration scales with rankAt  faster travel time or some kind of picking multiple things up.E scale stun duration. Or a flat stun duration increase at .E max QE range or E range rather than width. ,syndramains,d205idt,1,t5_3831v
7501189,0,t3_4i0i9a,Tear really does feel bad to build. It takes way too long to get any real AP to start dealing real damage because her base damages are average. Her early game Q really needs a base damage buff. Heck ill even take  damage on a rank  Q right now. ,syndramains,d2uuh5l,2,t5_3831v

7568596,0,t1_d32hy2w,Doesnt help that she has a shit tonne of annoying bugs since her release.Sometimes after ulting her model spazzes out completely WE interaction not working quite often sometimes damage from E will connect but no stun or vice versa.Im sure she would be played a lot more but when you randomly lose games because of bugs that have been in the game for years now it kinda kills your drive to play a champion.Hoping that people will play her more now if only to shone more light on them and get them fixed.,syndramains,d32iggu,2,t5_3831v
7578319,0,t1_d33e21d,Ive been an anivia main for a long time now attempting to main syndra with the new changes and she has been in a similar spot for a long time. Mechanically very difficult to play but once mastered could be very dominant ingame.  Of course with . they simply gutted anivias kit to simply make her unplayable instead of like syndra where her changes  made her a lot easier to pick up.I definitely was expecting syndra to be a lot harder to play and do well with.  Instead she seemed very fluid and easy to understand right from my first game with her.  Large AE slowsdamage lanewide stun late game and balls that last forever allowing for her maxult to be used fairly easily.  I think maybe just one or two of those would be fine but all of it getting easier seems a bit much.Like you said maybe a balance would be better with some tuning up of her burst while reducing her CC potential maybe just reverting her W? to allow new players an easier time playing her while allowing those syndra masters to take her even farther.,syndramains,d33ma6s,1,t5_3831v
7607816,0,t1_d36x3fw,yes luden has earlier powerspike i will not debate that so we shall wait for the numbers Full credit to Forte for stormraider i did not believe it worked until i saw it on stream and then tried it and fell in love. I cant do thunderlord anymore honestly it is a perfect escape and kiting mechanism.For runes and masteries you will need a lot of math to prove it to all of us hard heads. Many of us have been jumping from scaling cdr scaling health scaling AP and so on. Recently it has been all about the mr pen so whichever has more utility or burst i cant wait to see what you can present to us ,syndramains,d36ywco,2,t5_3831v
7622101,0,t1_d388hdx,OH man  you gotta play with ludens  look at the passive man! It basically becomes a new thunderlords for you and actually deals more damage bc its an AE thunderlords.  So you get thunderlords  stormraiders.  Its insanely strong right now.,syndramains,d38lcn4,1,t5_3831v

8104830,0,t1_d4r08c2,I dunno at that point people will have MR in their builds and I feel like Void Staff does more to hinder that than Deathcap. I also see Deathcap as an endgame item because of how strong its passive is when you have a lot of AP stacked up already which is gonna be a huge powerspike and maybe its just me but it feels like Voidstaff is a really big powerspike too even when no one builds any resistances.P.S. Sorry it took me an hour to respond I fell asleep xD.,syndramains,d4r20a6,1,t5_3831v

8380638,0,t3_4ueyz2,Sounds like the high speed roaming sniper Syndra from before when there was the ludensswifties build.I guess its a playstyle but its not mine.,syndramains,d5p4mng,2,t5_3831v
8854280,0,t1_d7c5k35,In any situation you are desperately needing less cooldown on E or are frontloading her damage to snipe people. If E is nd max you can usually throw away W for sphere refreshes regardless of damage. This makes it somewhat easier to maintain spheres in high sphere snipegtkill situations.,syndramains,d7c5qmv,2,t5_3831v

9992838,0,t1_db9zqlp,Yes but due to the number Zhonya is a very bad item and it guts your powerspike especially on a mage like Lux who just barely has enough damage to even functionLook at her cooldowns. Even assassin like Ahri or LeBlanc prefers not to build zhonya unless they absolutely have to.Aside from the fact that W rework is busted. I dont find her ultimate exactly fair at all. In the current state of the game its the single highest ap scaling targeted nuke. Riot deemed Veigars old ult unhealthy for the game why not in Syndras case?I understand the case behind her Ultimates design choice is that its gated by spheres management. But to be honest even without the W passive you can just cast  Qs on the go for  spheres ult which is exactly the amount of spheres necessary to  Lux in this video.I find her to be too loaded with damages from mutiple damage sources with not enough opportunity for counterattacks from the opposition. Most of the time she doesnt even need her ultimate to be a threat. She can use it as a fallback cushion in case someone jump on her face when she doesnt have her E and she needs to quickly delete them. Her potent AoE stun and low cooldown Q can keep people at bay. In my opinion prerework Syndra was perfectly fine except for the insane number of bugs which keep her from being reliable. But her design... I dont know she will always feel unfair to play against unless her numbers are low.,syndramains,dba3f7c,0,t5_3831v
10066699,0,t1_dbjhxkf,gt I love power hungry questionably evil people with crazy demigod magicYou sound like my Fiance lol.  Her loading screen was awesome admittedly I didnt get it at first.  When I did it made me want a song about how badass she is.  Ive been hoping for like two years now that one of the league bandsmusicians would come through.  As far as Im aware of no such luck ,syndramains,dbjppp7,1,t5_3831v
10279856,0,t3_5n7jau,The net result of this idea still only means  sphere has to hit to achieve her  and  sphere windows comfortably. The oldest living sphere is the most relevant in her power spike curve so if the oldest one is one that hits theres that. It does affect her ambient life timer availability but I cant really see it in any way thats super compelling.Overall not terribly convinced this is a productive route to balance her accessibility around.,syndramains,dc9a0lu,1,t5_3831v
10429532,0,t1_dcpzzg0,Alright thanks for the tips.,syndramains,dcq98qv,1,t5_3831v
11362068,0,t1_dfjiny6,Basically its about the Item beeing not that gold efficient without the aura which has less range than QWE and lategame ultimate. SInce you usually always want to be at your very max range on Syndra it makes it kinda meh when there isnt atleast  to  ap sources in the enemie team. Then there was the change of the passive which changed the aura from reduce enemie Mr to increase magic damage which makes it more efficient if you have much ap. SO kinda a scaling Item which you dont want to rush. SO basically when you want early mr you should just stay on a negatron cloak.,syndramains,dfjvaqb,1,t5_3831v
