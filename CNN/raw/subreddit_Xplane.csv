9869654,0,t3_5gj2ri,Yup as others have said it sounds like icing on the wings which would totally change the liftstall characteristics of the wings.  Given you said it went into a stall first this sounds like the most likely candidate.  Pretty scary how ice forming on the leading edge and wing surfaces can take a perfectly good aircraft and turn it into a stone in a very short period of time!,Xplane,dau1elo,2,t5_2t9qj

10930630,0,t1_de77q9a,Right now I find ground control of large numbers of aircraft to be appalling  in xplane . Just try loading up the Stinson supplied with x plane and try to take off.  If real world ground control was that tough noone would fly.Im not a real pilot but something is really wrong on the ground right now....,Xplane,de7f1gb,2,t5_2t9qj
11315643,0,t3_5upj6r,Ive got both PD and XP  .  With exception of some of the planes that are not yet supported on XP Im almost exclusively using it for my IFR practice.  I primarily used PD before XP came along as XP felt less refined.  ,Xplane,dfelyuq,1,t5_2t9qj
