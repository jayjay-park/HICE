It makes her videos almost boring sometimes because she takes the time to test stuff over multiple days and she takes lots of footage for each day to show you how stuff is wearing plus photos for flash tests. So it can be a bit long but the reviews are so helpful. Shes in her s I think and Im much younger but still her reviews help me figure out what I should try.

11233537,0,t1_df4q2ua,There was plenty to salvage IMO. Certainly there were those of us who would never trust or support those mods again but the last time I checked a few hours before it went private again they still had over K subs. Someone I think in this thread explained they hadnt been very affected by the poor modding and would have probably been unaware of most anything if they hadnt shut down without warning the first time  which to me suggests there are plenty of folks out there who would have stayed if they had been able to continue accessing their content. If the mods had issued a genuine apology started acting right I guarantee the sub would have stayed at least K strong and in  months this whole fiasco may have been largely forgiven or forgotten by many of the folks who hadnt been affected.. IF they hadnt been affected. They really chose almost the worst most embarrassing least forgivable or overlookable course of action that was available to them. It is god damn embarrassing and I call shame on their houses.I dont mean to sound like its all bad  this has been fun to watch and I  BGCr and all the discussions Ive seen its just...

Explain the price point. That part of the video was enlightening. . Explain how the quality is checked in more detail. Show more of the samples and what you personally do and what you do if something is wrong. . Say this all came about because there are dupes and there are rip offs. Say this is what Id consider a rip off. Show MUR palette. . Show me the consumer how I am getting ripped off as well for buying an inferior product. Swatch it. Compare colors. Show to me what you think is plagiarism. Tell me that I can go buy it sure but Im just not going to get the look I want without the original. As a consumer Id be a whole lot less tempted to buy the dupe when I realized it was a waste of money. Even after all of this Im still curious. I could run and acquire the MUR palette today in like ten minutes. If I wanted hers Id have to order or drive an hour. Make me want to go through the extra effort for something you believe in. Right now... Im still not sure.  I understand its got to sting to see something you feel was stolen.

11274065,0,t3_60wm2s,I appreciate his honesty. Hes right almost every influencer does this but only a few admit to it. This is also the reason why I stopped using instagram. At the time I didnt know how much filtering and editing was going on so I thought all those perfect faces we see were  real and it killed my self esteem. And now that Ive realized how edited the photos are I dont have any intention of going back and follow those people who edit their photos. Thats why I havent followed James too and probably never will. But again as I said I appreciate his honesty. Also I dont wanna comment on him slimming down his nose etc as its his personal choice but I feel like as a makeup artist changing the color of his makeup is a bit... I dont know false advertising? He literally said he always edits his face to a neutral color which changes the color of his foundation his highlight blush bronzer etc. If someone was purely going by the pictures on his instagram and purchased the products he used they may get disappointed.,BeautyGuruChatter,df9wd97,15,t5_3jayp

However I think he also exaggerates for the camera and we dont really know the full story behind a lot of what he talks about.

Honestly I think I like this series so much bc Im super put off by so many reviews really being first impressions that at best have one day of wear often really just done for the camera and about application only. So a series that truly tests the makeup in a bit more of an extreme situation draw me in hahaI really like the outfit she put together for the Masquerade she went to also paired with her bfs. Its a fun look with colours I really like together. I dont do eye makeup anything like KCs but its still fun to see how other people do their everyday stuff especially bc I know a few items I own overlap with her collection. Just interesting seeing how different the same stuff can be. yall Im exhausted so Im quitting while Im ahead  I feel like coherency is gone rn and am the drunk girl throwing out compliments atm.

You are most definitely NOT a bad feminist but I do feel that its a legitimate question to try to figure out how you feel justified in telling a woman how she feels.  To me it came across as tone policing.  I expressed frustration and since I did we needed to talk about my tone and reinterpret my feelings rather than the point Im trying to make.

I dont think she stopped a conversation from beginning I honestly think she probably piqued peoples curiosity more than anything. Either way she has a good point if anyone is really struggling they need to not watch it the suicide scene alone was shockingly real.
