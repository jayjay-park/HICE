You want to come across as professional I assume so dont say interwebs and talk informally like as I was saying.. You need to sell yourself and not speak of failure. Dont even mention that the app you made Tradelly was a failure. You have to sell it even if it doesnt exist any more. At most you can make a passing comment at the end about the founder moving on to other ventures.. You have a project listed that has nothing because its in progress. That was a total waste of a click to me dont put that there unless you have some information to put there.Otherwise great stuff  I like your transitions.,userexperience,cfynlfg,9,t5_2qj2z

The organizations who elect to build a certification program that will live for years and years i.e. Missioncentric think about how to run the program longterm.Yes theyre also banking on a lot of prospective students getting caught up in the name.  I dont know a lot of Devdesign managers or organizations that get nearly so caught up in paper though some big companies love to require full Masterslevel degrees just because they can and it cuts the size of the resume pile by   portfolio or at least the ability to demonstrate your working process seem much more likely to lead to jobs.But hey I live in Portlandia which might not be reflective of the industry country or worldwide.

It will bump your pay up a bit more when you eventually get a job but you do not need to go to grad school to get into UX. You already know how to code which gives you a big advantage at the right company. Bigger companies with more specialists probably wont care as much  they already have all the super devs they need but you would have a leg up on an entry level generalist.,userexperience,cnpib3e,2,t5_2qj2z
2875770,0,t3_2sz1k0,Im taking the part time class in London at the moment. Im also blogging about it here on a weekly basis Lots of people in my class do not have a development background. Actually i would say there is about  of us out of ish that are developers. There are quite a few more designers. Then there are Business analysts and product managers and other stuff.           I think an ability to think logically and clearly and to empathise with other people are the most important skills. You dont need much specific experience though of course it can help.    I find the community around GA to be excellent here in London. My teacher and the TAs are really enthusiastic and engaging. One TA has just started a coffee club outside of class  mins before class starts for two people to attend each week and get feedback on their projects or ask questions. That is just out of his own time.         I wish i could have had time to do the full time course but i could not afford it and also take the time off work.

4873552,0,t1_cu7fj5t,Thank you Ethnographic!I took a look at the links you posted in response to my other question and some applied anthropology programs looked promising.So far my wish list is . Univ Washington  PhD in HCDE. UC Berkeley  PhD in Information unlikely   admission rate. Univ Michigan  PhD in Information. Royal College of Art London  PhD in Design Research. University of Copenhagen  PhD in Anthropology . University of Swinburne  PhD in DesignOthers. Northwestern Univ  PhD in Tech and Social Behavior. Virginia Tech  PhD in HCIIts a little tricky figuring out what an MFA in Design is good for. I heard back from Univ of Michigan and Univ of Washington. They both said I was eligible to apply... but I dont know if that means my MFA credits will count towards the PhD degree. I suspect that more technical programs will require more catching up. As far as interests I am passionate about behavior design research. So psychology applied anthro and HCI programs are all exciting to me. Focusing on qual gt quant.......Do any other resources come to mind..? I want to aim for schools with a reasonable admissions rate and reasonable reputation. My ultimate goal is to become an expert on behavior design. For example similar to BJ Fogg from Stanford. My MFA focused on behavior change design but my daytoday job is UX research for mechanical engineer software. Id love to return to that sweetspotnugget topic of behaviorinfluencing design mechanisms. Additionally I care deeply about social justice issues and opportunities for social change via technology design ex how Twitter has revolutionized freedom of speech in oppressed nations.

Were looking for great teams rather than individual rockstars so being able to collaborate in all areas whilst providing your team with depth of knowledge in a specialism is great.Show you can solve problems which actually matter. Certainly at some point youll do website design or work with marketing on an asdor video but the majority of you time is going to be working on something much more complex  Watson internet of things data analytics etc. So were always looking for strong process  ability to dig deeply into a complex problem using research principles a strong perspective on the problem rather than simply do something which looks good and makes other designers like it.Most design teams involve people in research UX visual design and front end dev roles. You work closely with marketing engineering and product management teams so demonstrating collaboration is a must. Industry recognition is a huge plus  are you sharing your skills by writing articles speaking at conferences etc. Other than that its cultural fit and thatd a tricky one to describe.

As a photographer Im assuming quality photos of the process whether of me doing work or screenshots or etc would be a good way of presenting my work.

7897774,0,t3_4ngw6x,In my experience the key differentiator in this situation is Are there a proportion of your users especially those whove used the site multiple times for whom the text would be superfluous?If either through their own experience or through frequentenough usage they would not need the text then hiding it behind an obviousenough affordance is a potentially rational design optimisation. There are two mistaken assumptions to watch out for however. Believing without testing that your users will learn AND RETAIN the knowledge. I believed that for a previous product I owned and it took me a couple of years to recognise that my users generally didnt use the site often enough that anything wed taught them contextually the last time was something they oftenenough remembered that they werent confused the next time.. The affordance eg. Button under which you hide the extra text is obvious to users. Its dead obvious to you  you put it there  but theres no telling without some usability testing whether your users will even notice it when theyre trying to figure out the answer to their confusion.,userexperience,d43s7qh,1,t5_2qj2z

8993857,0,t1_d7spv7s,I agree I graduated from an HCI program a few years back. I was impressed by the real world industry focus the program had in which I got to apply what I learned. Great programs in UX foundational elements such as HumanComputer Interaction Human Factors and Interaction Design are out there. There has been tons of blowback towards traditional accredited higher educational programs within the UX community recently but great programs offered by schools like UofM CMU Stanford and Washington for example really help brand yourself as a serious UX professional and gives you the ability to work for great companies. One of the problems Ive been seeing in the educational space of UX are bootcamps churn out folks with a very small knowledge base of user centric methodologies and portfolios that look identical with hypothetical projects with no real world impact. I really hope some oversight is taken to some of the more shady bootcamps that are clearly just cashing in the the UX gold rush. ,userexperience,d7sx7nj,5,t5_2qj2z

9097703,0,t1_d85dyi3,This is the only real way. Auditing is a good first step but it really needs to be put in front of users to understand how to improve it. There is more than just usability that comes out of this. It can also highlight especially good or bad ideas within the product itself.  It that they likely want to go back that far but it tells you what to emphasize and what there product means to a user. Its a great thing to do. That being said you dont need a big budget. Get  people who are in the target market via screen sharing or something easy and just do it. If they literally have no users or refuse to help you contact any then just do it yourself with acquaintances that are somewhat similar to the user personas. Unless there is some sort of super huge NDA on the work at the worst there is still other staff that can test it if they havent seen it too much yet. ,userexperience,d85eb31,2,t5_2qj2z

If you want to be a UX designer spending your time learning code will not land you a UX job when you graduate.

11431167,0,t3_635mt6,Theres three things you need to test for contrast line length and comprehension. Lea Verou author of CSS Secrets has a contrast checker tool  and you can find similar ones that test the WCAG definition of adequate text contrast  here Line length greatly affects readability. Generally  characters per line is considered standard but you also need to balance that against the font size line height and the reading distance which will be different for mobile tablet and desktop contexts. Lastly comprehension comes down to testing your users. Is the copy easy enough to understand did they make more or fewer errors etc. So to the point of an allinone tool the simplest way to test it is an HTML mockup with responsive CSS for your headlines and body copy with adequate contrast baked in test across devices and tweak it until it meets your passing criteria for your target audience. Keep in mind that the user may set zoom levels so there may be some natural variability there too. ,userexperience,dfrpln4,2,t5_2qj2z
