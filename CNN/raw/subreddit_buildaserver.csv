Redundancy works by mirroring the other drives onto multiple drives. For example if you had  TB drives all in a RAID  array you would have a capacity of TB and a fault tolerance of one drive. Basically if one drive failed all of your data would still be intact and you could keep using all of the drives normally but you should probably replace it ASAP. Your data read rates would also be tripled. RAID  works similarly but if you had  TB drives in RAID  you would have TB of available room but you would have a fault tolerance of  drives as well as a x read rate. ,buildaserver,cmrklo2,1,t5_2twqf
