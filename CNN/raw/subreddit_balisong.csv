Just think about it and what the quality is gonna be like.  Im not saying it will be horrible but it probably wont be as good as a Terry Guinn or other curved knives.

4755698,0,t1_cttwq5l,Steel is a different ball game. The basic answer is not really. You can heat steel to get some slight colors but you start changing its structural properties after its been heated it will effectively be annealed in its softest state.

7466556,0,t1_d2qsjws,gt Not sure about the BMX series. There is already a T and everyone wants replacement handles not blades PGood point I hadnt thought of putting FlyTi on a T.gt As for the spacer alternatives are you talking about heavier spacers say swing kits?Im more talking about lighter spacers actually. A lot of people end up rounding their handles and regrinding their blade which throws off the over all weight distribution of the knife. The AltB has lighter spacers to account for the lighter blade so even just reproducing those or something with an identical weight would be a great start.gt As for the sharpness of the Squidtrainer I probably wont be changing that design but I do understand that it is still very weaponlooking. However I feel that being considered a weapon is better than being considered a butterfly knife since balisongs have much steeper restrictions. Thats certainly your prerogative.gt Bushings are probably on my list of soon to come but honestly the handle play on the current squidtrainers are so low that I dont know if its worth the investment. Im trying to keep the pricing low and although I do want the bushings to be an option Id have to be producing on a larger scale to make it an efficient and profitable model. Giving people a base model with a list of upgradeable options is a great business model and I think youve done a pretty good job of identifying that already.,balisong,d2qwgef,1,t5_2vxpf

8426326,0,t1_d5utq4d,Well not mirroring because in balis you have to do the tricks backwards. For a Zen rollover in the right hand you swing the safe handle counterclockwise. To do the same in the left hand would mean it rolling over the back of your thumb and hand so to do it correctly you would have to swing the handle clockwise. You see what I mean? Often times in double weapons we would move the weapons in the same direction so youre essentially striking with both weapons but in the same direction. If I ever get  balis I will definitely try though. As of now I only have one ,balisong,d5utyuj,1,t5_2vxpf

9636420,0,t1_da0b2vh,No these obstacles arent easy to mitigate. The main obstacle I didnt realize is actual illegality! That sucks and its impossible to work around while maintaining respectability.I dont have a solution but my impression was that manufacturers normally need to pushincentivize stores to carry their products rather than the other way around. Sometimes this is a rotten deal for the manufacturerfor example Ive heard of stores paying manufacturers for products only after theyre sold and sending them back possibly with damaged packaging if they dont sell.All I can say as a customer is that I dont want to buy a clone I prefer a brand that nobody has heard of over shanzhai crap but buying a multihundred dollar knife is not a responsible thing to do. I normally refuse to buy clones since that says no quality but theres a hole in the market right nownobody knows about any decent quality Chinese or cheaply manufactured balisong that isnt a clone. This hole in the market is the crux of my annoyance about the current state of economics.When it comes to flashlights American patriots buy Surefire or Quark frugal smart people buy Fenix or Sunwayman these actually make original and unique products which I think are better than the American ones and poorish people and dumb ones buy clones. That middle category doesnt exist for balisongs. When it does Ill shop there.,balisong,da0vywo,1,t5_2vxpf

So why not make regular rep drops at the original price and sell many different type of scales extra. That way people get reps at standard price and brs makes a little more extra from the people who want to customize those reps with different scales. More options more money for brs without any weirdness everyone wins. They could even offer different scale materials and things like that.

After I put the screws back in I had to adjust them to my liking to reduce handle play I like a little play but I dont like blade rub and when I came back  days later the pivots were so tight that neither of the handles could move. I took the screws back out cleaned them and the handles were still tight. I suspect maybe I got some loctite on the blade or handles and that was causing them to be stiff. I ran it through my sonic cleaner amazing for cleaning guns or quickly cleaning knives btw and messed with the handles and now its fine. I can flip it smoothly without screws pressure fitted sexbolts.Id like to get some loctite applied tonight. Is there something I dont know about?

11348019,0,t1_dfi8uqs,Glad to hear youre getting the full experience of low quality balisongs.Oh hell yeah. Then I went and spent  on my current knife. Am I compensating?Actually I feel like a bit of an ass now since I could have waited a bit and bought a better knife. But no the impatient son of a bitch I am I just had to buy a  black coated blade not satin and FlyTi scales. I actually like the look more than I expected I would but looking back now I could have waited and basically spent the same amount to buy an Infinity. Ridiculous but then I knew basically zero about flipping and balisongs in general. I just read reviews and then bought what was available that people agreed was good.Anyway on to my response Ive actually wanted to remove the pocket clip from my knife for a bit. It doesnt add a lot of weight but I can still feel a difference in momentum and speed between for example a YK and a zen rollover. Plus it messes with my grip every so often and since I dont EDC it the clip really is unnecessary. However I had readheard somewhere that you cant actually remove the pocket clip from the  something about the screws being too long without the added width that the clip provides. Is that info correct? If not cool and if so how did you get around it to remove your clip? I think the latch is awesome. I love the spring and have never had any issues with it that I hadnt caused mostly dropping the knive so it caused the latch to lock back thus keeping the handles from opening fully. I think that the weight of the latch is relatively negligible but the clip needs to go.Since youve got a FlyTi  what are your thoughts on it? My conclusion thus far is that it seems a bit handle heavy particularly on the bite side. Flippingwise its smooth seems to carry momentum a lot better than with the G scales and is fairly predictable. Aerials are no problem rollovers flow really nicely Im still working on chaplins but the knife doesnt seem to be fighting me with them. One thing that I cant get whether its my fault or the knife just isnt particularly wellsuited for is fanning. Basic fans are all Ive tried and I cannot get them to work. I try to roll the handle in my fingers and I just cant seem to generate the momentum I need. Any thoughts? Im a tall guy with large hands so smallweak fingers isnt an issue.edit Ive no idea how to clip a line from a postcomment and add it to my own comment so I added quotation marks around my quote P ,balisong,dfi9zt4,1,t5_2vxpf
