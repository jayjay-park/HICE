1000342,0,t3_25jy36,This faction is even more interesting than I thought. No buildings but also no resources...Catalyst just restores hit points...it splits up...And it can hike over all kinds of terrain except water. And swamp over units. Damn. This is going to give a lot of strategy...also the Mother Goo...if it can swamp over enemy units and eating them isnt it some sort of epic unit? ,greygoo,chhzw3m,3,t5_30x6r
2813975,0,t1_cnnxgrd,Yeah i agree the fact they can go across high terrain is really nice feature i quite like that all units and kind hide in the bushes unless enemy units enter them.I wonder if they auto attack in this state or you have to set it to passive?!!,greygoo,cnnxw8i,1,t5_30x6r

2932445,0,t1_co1fc3u,You can expand to any resources that you see and the stealth harvester tech upgrade helps to hide your supply line. Other than that I agree that it can be difficult for the humans to expand to far away resources. Much harder than with the beta or goo imo,greygoo,co1fir4,2,t5_30x6r

2980263,0,t3_2uayx2,The first human mission has a bonus objective that only appears once you put an extractor on a distant pool southeast pools specifically maybe? which is a little weird since theres no reason whatsoever to need to expand before you finish that mission.I wondered why my first playthrough didnt give me the human bonuses achievement went back after finishing the game did just the first human mission thoroughly found that bonus and got everything I was missing.,greygoo,co6vdsk,1,t5_30x6r

3216690,0,t1_covbasm,Removing the scout unit would be the worst thing. How would you know if you face a fast expansion or fast rush build? Most of the maps are broken by design. We need better maps thats all. ,greygoo,coveu1c,1,t5_30x6r
3222263,0,t1_covv585,The only real problem I have with it running across Origin is the launchers being broken cant set command variables ingame.Luckily there are mods to get around that.,greygoo,covznyf,1,t5_30x6r

4189675,0,t1_crxt55o,while it pains me to say it I do wish I could get a refund for Grey Goo sorry Petroglyph. I dont think we will be refunded seeing as how The Steam refund offer within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime applies to games and software applications on the Steam store. in the refund page states that refunds are valid for purchases less then  days old and with only two hours of playtime I have .,greygoo,crxtmxa,7,t5_30x6r
4979504,0,t1_cum79rr,Yeah true I guess it could be something for the future when players go up. I think it would keep more interest,greygoo,cum7cuo,1,t5_30x6r
5361068,0,t3_3o072t,Put IMO all over ...   Well one problem is that GG is not designed to accept MODS. So always only one view on the problem will prevail and manifest itself through a feature striders everywhere in your diagnosis. Stat mods or balance mods are not guaranteed to solve anything but would provide some insights and more important make people talk.  The second problem is a playerbase problem. Ppl often tend to say artillery should be nerfed or predators are OP and such. It would help if ppl adopt a concept approach or war doctrine of how each faction should be or behave and then the prognostics are nerfing this or that and so on. Im not a balance specialist but whenever we say a change for one unit only that is actualy a point of entry. From that change there will be consequences. And it would help if the devs could tell us something like we want unit A more OP than their equivalents in the other factions so we dont have to stay in the dark guessing all the time. But they cant do that because it activates trollers ...  ,greygoo,cvwxqvh,2,t5_30x6r
5672297,0,t1_cwyhdj1,It actually sounds like some of your issues with fighting goo early might be with micro rather than your overall approach. All things being equal commandos kill drovers you just need to micro properly to avoid the aoe blasts i.e. Individually separate your commandos plus you can usually avoid getting eaten by mothers in the early game by keeping the bulk of your forces away from the sides of hills and bushes that way you will always be able to outrun the mother. Small proteans are then the main way that the goo can actually fight your commandos early and again as long as you keep your commandos separated there are severe limits to what the goo player can do with that. Put all of this stuff together and you can see that Goo rush doesnt really work all that well as long as you know the specific unit matchups.,greygoo,cx07dh5,4,t5_30x6r
5957893,0,t3_3x0pug,As long as you have a mother at each terminal the timer should start again. make sure theyre definitely in contact with the terminals.,greygoo,cy0lzqv,3,t5_30x6r
