1147496,0,t3_2798fr,Im suspecting the core stage will be orange like the Shuttle external tank and Delta IV. Theres no reason to paint on hundreds of kilograms of waste mass onto the vehicle. ,SpaceLaunchSystem,chypfhk,5,t5_2ybvq
1363278,0,t3_29o46z,Close friend of mine is one of the prime MEs left at Kennedy for this project.  He has been pulling his hair out on this review figures.  Proud of him and the things he has been able to do over the years.  Pudwacker Hell understandLOL,SpaceLaunchSystem,cin6cyv,1,t5_2ybvq
3045452,0,t3_2v0ebv,While this is an important study and the  year launch cadence is worth looking at because its a stated possibility its rather annoying that every single safety or schedule or funding critique seems to focus on stated worst case scenarios. Yes a  year launch cadence would be a horrible thing from a safety and risk standpoint. Its also been thoroughly expressed as an absolute worst case in launch schedule. This would be the launch rate if NASA saw significantly reduced funding down tens of percents. Even if the budget held constant at current rates a launch rate of every  months is fully achievable and a better one is probably possible. Nobody in NASA administration or the US government wants launch rates below  per year once full rate production gets under way. It would be nice for the article to at least mention that.,SpaceLaunchSystem,codns62,6,t5_2ybvq
6601942,0,t1_d02420h,There was actually a NASA study that showed Orion on a DIVH with no DCSS could reach the ISS so Im curious as to what you mean by they shouldve built a better upper stage for Delta.,SpaceLaunchSystem,d0271eh,1,t5_2ybvq
6829173,0,t1_d0q1zo9,ok that solidifies the conversation a great deal. nice find. they could decide for a larger mission which needs a beefier stage but otherwise your suggestion seems reasonable,SpaceLaunchSystem,d0qdxye,1,t5_2ybvq
8514905,0,t3_4wcrg5,Test render of SLS in its Block B configuration with OrbitalATKs proposed Dark Knight boosters.  Despite being shown as black they would be actually painted white for thermal reasons Ive added the silly orange swooshes.  With the m payload fairing.,SpaceLaunchSystem,d65x72c,1,t5_2ybvq
