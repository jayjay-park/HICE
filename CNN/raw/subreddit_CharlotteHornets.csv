Every time he gets a touch on offense i cringe because he ALWAYS shoots a fadeaway baseline jumper. He has such great athletic ability but he just never drives enough.

1072196,0,t3_26e59z,You gotta take chances nowadays.  I dont know about Lances overall defense I know hes athletic enough to be disruptive but you have to have superstar potential on offense to win in the NBA.I look at Lance right now and think hes in a similar position that Harden was in when he was leaving OKC.  People wondered if he could do it on his own not coming off the bench.  Ignoring his complete lack of defense hes answered the questions on the offensive side of the ball.  I dont think Lance will be as good offensively as Harden but I think he has a lot of potential.I say go for it.  Especially considering hes a free agent so we wouldnt lose anything by getting him.  If Lance pans out and we hit on the  pick plus any other luck with the later picks were looking like a legit team in the East.,CharlotteHornets,chq5vl8,4,t5_2txxp

I honestly just wish one game could be a blowout  either way  so we could see just how raw players like Biyombo or more importantly Vonleh really are.If we cant solve the problem internally I would first turn to free agency.  If Charlotte could somehow convince Jermaine ONeal Emeka Okafor or even Bernard James to join the team I believe any would be an immediate upgrade at backup center.

4060134,0,t3_36sqmi, I probably would have taken Ty Lawson or moved up to try and steal Terrence Williams. Which shows what I know. I still dont understand how Williams bellyflopped so badly. Wish I could claim that I was in on Curry but I wasnt feeling super strongly about him at the time. Thought hed be a really good shooter but did not see this coming if Id moved up to take him it would have been because of local ties.  cough  Id have passed on Bismack. I was high on Kawhi but not high enough so as much as Id like to claim that I cant. Probably one of KembaKnight assuming the real roster I wouldnt really need a PG if I had got Lawson or taken Curry and then either Klay or Burks. With my luck itd have been Burks.If I get to keep Tobias Harris and dont do the threeway that took SJax and Livingston out of town I keep Harris and seek an alternate deal to move them out assuming were in the tankwhile taking either a PG if I didnt get Ty or a SG not named Jimmer was really not sold on him at .  MKG. He was the obvious  guy. The only other guy Id have been willing to go after would be Beal. One thing that really sticks out with these first three is the dearth of frontcourt guys I liked at the time I thought Robinson was colossally overrated. Still have trouble believing that Cleveland took Dion Fucking Waiters . No idea what they were thinking then still dont know now. I remember just staring at the tv for like fifteen seconds after it was announced.  Nerlens Noel. I was sold on his defensive potential. Also this hypothetical needs big men and I wasnt real high on Len or indeed Cody.  Vonleh. With a yawning void up front and Vonleh the only frontcourt talent available worthy of the pick the only alternative would have been trading down. Vonleh seemed like a fairly obvious top  pick that just fell to us at . Capela would be a strong possibility at  instead of Napier gt trade. That said its not like the PJ deal was bad at all. I just dont like him much.e So best case  Curry KlayHarris MKG Noel Vonleh  Capela or PJ. Pie in the sky lol. No way this would actually happen because butterfly effect and because itd be nighimpossible to move up without coughing up a future st to get Curry. Worst case Williams BurksHarris MKG Noel Vonleh  Capela or PJ. Depressingly possible if unlikely! God. I dont even want to guess whod be playing point guard for Charlotte in this universe. Felton after he ballooned and crashed out in Portland? Ack. Most likely case  Lawson Burks  Harris Noel Vonleh Capela or PJ. Wed still need shooting. Burks and Ty are adequate pt shooters but Harris didnt really round himself into adequacy until this year. Wed actually probably be worse off in the longer run because Ty and Burks in the backcourt with Harris on the wing would be nowhere near as bad as some of the hot garbage the Cats put out there so wed miss out on the chances for the other guys. At the very least we probably wouldnt have landed in a position to land MKG and then who the hell knows.,CharlotteHornets,crj332t,2,t5_2txxp

None of us know how Winslow or Frank will turn out though. Instead of being a butt hurt arm chair GM Im just going to let the organization make their moves and remain calm.

6656328,0,t1_d07qfdx,Also the draft in  is a big part of our history now.  We had the worst season in NBA history with only  wins.  We had just lost our original franchise Hornets team to New Orleans in  who had a record x better than us with  wins that year.  We still failed to win the seemingly secretive  draft lottery process and wound up with just the nd overall pick missing out on a surefire franchise centerpiece super star in Anthony Davis one of the best players of his caliber to come down the line in years.  We got MKG as the nd pick who is great but no AD that we are now  relying on as a centerpiece for the future of the franchise.  Not to mention MKGs injury history although AD has had his own injury struggles.So New Orleans kinda took our team and our super star which sort of makes the Pelicans one of our more serious rivals.  Even though they are in the West rivalries arent that huge in the NBA and they are a team we have legitimate beef with.What made it worse it felt even shadier due to the fact the owner of the old team Shinn was a dead beat or something...  the NBA had to take possession of the team from him and find a new buyer to unload it on and make some money back.  So fortunately suspiciously? for the NBA the team they were trying to recover as much money as possible from the sale of wound up with the  draft pick for AD lolSo we hold MKG dear because hes the best player weve had a shot at in so many years of struggle and its a sore spot for our fans.,CharlotteHornets,d07tlvl,3,t5_2txxp

7441901,0,t1_d2nyscy,Again youve shown that you have no clue what youre talking about how to play basketball or have any indication that youve watch any of the games.  I have all these games on review you dont.  Kembas game is based on quickness otherwise hes hopeless against an elite defender with stupid long handsarms or even against Wade.  He doesnt draw fouls nor is he willing to hit the deck trying because he cant afford to.  Defensively hes too short and lack length to defend against someone like Wade.  Lin has that advantage hes taller and  pounds.  Hes the guy they ask to guard the other teams best players like Harden they dont ask Kemba. Hes the one who has to run all over the place on defense Kemba doesnt. You dont know that because you dont watch the fucking game.  Lin also has speed hes among the faster in the league and has made plays running from coast to coast on so many occasions.  He tires the other team out with his game but also tires himself out in the process. You dont know it because you dont watch the fucking game.  You think NBA players just drink Gatorade and theyre fine again.  Lin draws the double team and makes the plays doing it including a couple of great passes to Williams and Jefferson in game  if Kemba does that hes fucked because hes got no height to go over the defense if he has to pass over or around.  Again you dont watch the fucking game.  You say Lins dribbling skills is just one dimensional the guy creates so much havoc penetrating the defense attacking the lane going in and out of the key and creating for others while getting banged by the defense that it is impossible to do without having good ball control.  You cant even ask Kemba to switch roles because he will get eatenthefuck alive.  Again you dont watch the fucking game.You just dont have a fucking clue about basketball or players at all because you never watch the games.  You talk like these guys are no good especially Lin and that you have all the answers to improve their game.  Again what do you know?  You dont watch the fucking game.,CharlotteHornets,d2o3hp9,0,t5_2txxp

7448108,0,t1_d2orj11,The problem with Kembas hero ball is it only works against playoff defense once in a while.  Unless youre Lebron KD Curry or another ridiculous player it is too inefficient to depend on.  No one was scared to shoot or go to the rim.  The offense was stagnant except in games   and  when the Heat couldnt contain our pick and roll.  We lost Hawes and Zeller got hurt and there went our PNR.  Guys going to the rim met a stationary Whiteside who didnt have to worry about bigs cutting to the basket or giving up a wide open Hawes .  Clifford designed a great offense for our personnel and injuries robbed us of our chance to us it.

Even if it is the ers who arent a GREAT team still dont do it.Secondly if youre going to do it DEFINITELY dont do it when your team is on a terrible slide as one of the WORST teams in the league.

10782655,0,t1_dds42os,With the current team yes its impossible!But i think if you change Plumlee by Lopez Sessions by a better PG why not Ntilikina if were luck at the draft and maybe another player with the FA and our MLE then we would not be th or th as we are now but a sure lock in the playoff and get somewhere between  wins which would place our  pick somewhere between thth in the draft.and theres also the possibility to trade Belinelli amp Kaminsky for a good wing this summer maybe a bet like Gay who will come back from an injury or a player set to be FA in  like Ariza.,CharlotteHornets,dds5hu7,1,t5_2txxp

Johnny OBryant and Miles Plumlee are both supposed to miss Friday nights affair and Nicolas Batum is probably with an ankle issue.Damn so Franks recovery has been set back from initial hopes and now Batum and JOB are hurt too..

11238560,0,t1_df5vaia,Its not that the big wont be good enough to get minutes its that we dont have minutes to give them.  Trust me Id love to be able to grab Jonathan Jeanne and actually develop him but we already have  bigs under contract for next year.I also dont consider us a particularly strong candidate to trade down.  Wed love to be able to find another differencemaker in case thats truly what we need and a guy like Rabb or Adebayo isnt ever going to be that.  Plus this front office seems to have correctly evaluated that moving down in the draft tends to be a bad idea.,CharlotteHornets,df5vhtn,3,t5_2txxp

11493617,0,t1_dfyc044,If we say youre right about MKGs potential and we assume that we dont get anyone decent in the draft a trade for Butler would be a winnow trade of the highest level. If we add Butler we dont have the cap for more free agent signings and were not quite good enough to contend. If we hold tight we have a developing core which should peak in about  years which is when I think well have the best chance of going for a title anyhow due to the concentration of talent right now.In  years wed have a starting lineup of KembaMediumlow level allstarBatumHighlevel jackofalltrades type playerelite glue guyMKGElite defensive wing who should be alldefense by this pointFrankPossibly borderline allstar elite scoring big at worst.CodyElite PnR playerTyson Chandlertype bigAdd a good sixth man and a strong bench and Im confident we can at the very least make a ECF and possibly contend in a postLebron world.If we trade for Butler were throwing that away to try to compete at a time when no team is really getting out of the east with Lebron still dominant. I just dont think its worth it for Butler. For all we know he could decline very quickly or get injured and we lost two valuable picks. It just doesnt make sense to me at this point to trade picks for anything but a guaranteed shot at a championship. We can do it with our current core if were patient.,CharlotteHornets,dfystvk,1,t5_2txxp
