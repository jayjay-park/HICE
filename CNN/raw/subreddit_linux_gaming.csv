Have you ever written an interceptor or a bytecode compiler before? Both of those are crucial skills towards building a real game engine. Heck have you ever written a makefile before?If you havent check out my repo that includes an example makefile that builds and links against SDL .. Its a final fantasy clone written in C and SDL.Right now im reading Game Scripting Mastery to learn how to build a bytecode compiler for a game engine. The code is very old uses Borland functions but I like its coverage and I plan to upload a more recent version to my github.If your serious about building a full unity editor competitor look into Qt. You can download QtCreator to create the interface and easily get prebuilt windows and mac libaries linux will require the package manager.

You have to have that power to slice through all the Windows bloat.Linux has no such pacts or reasons to make Linux slower as to require new Hardware. Such notions are brought over to the Linux world by Windows users. You dont need all that power to do things on Linux not even for Games.Virtualization. Generally a bad Idea unless you dont mind major performance decreases as opposed to simply running the Game in WINE. WINE exists for a reason you know and things like VMWare have different uses mostly business oriented software.You mention an R its mostly agreed that the  series has the best overall support on Linux. New Hardware like the R currently has issues same as the  and  series although we are starting to see the  series becoming the new hardware with support equaling the  series. If you had a top of the line  series card with Linux there shouldnt be any Game currently available that you couldnt run unlike Windows.Yeah sure if the recent controversy about the NSAMicrosoft pact doesnt bother you and all the Malware and other issues that come with Windows like lack of choice and lockins feel free to stick with it.People who start out with Linux and Open Source usually get the most benefit as they are not lockedin to anything.

1336739,0,t1_cijwike,Yes you are right it is quite easy. All that good will. CD Projekt RED is known for good will but with the Linux community that good will really went down the drain. It would be magnificent if CD Projekt RED had gone with Feral or Aspyr for its extremely high profile game considering the communication and the effort these two porting houses have displayed so far.But it didnt. I would have been fine if the game just worked but it didnt do that either. Insulting the poor end product is perfectly justified. It was shoddy at the time of release and is less shoddy now. When people with Nvidia GTX  GPUs Nvidias driver is on par with its Windows counterpart cannot play the game on anything but the lowest settings and still get crappy frames per second then you really really have to question if spending money on this item was worth it. Like many have said when even Wine gives you better frames per second and at higher settings too the product is nothing more than a shoddy wrapjob. It felt completely untested. Why do excited customers have to go through a public beta or public alpha even now that the game has been officially released when that should have all been gotten out of the way before the official release? There is no justification for that whatsoever.As others have said...gtIf your port uses a wrapper thats worse than something not explicitly made for your game or even games in general youve got some shit to work through to fix it.,linux_gaming,cijzzgq,6,t5_2r2u0
1339260,0,t1_cik9n9q,I think metacritic ratings are a really bad way of judging the quality of a game. I tend to find myself disagreeing with many professional game reviewers and it seems that many just echo each others opinions these days. I think watching a couple of lets plays of the games first couple of levels is a much better way of getting info about a game.I dont want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but sometimes it seems that game journalists have some kind of collusion with rich developers. Recent examples include games like Battlefield  Titanfall WatchDogs and Simcity which were universally acclaimed by critics but were disliked by many gamers for being buggy having limitations and DRM or simply being bland and boring. Sure these games sell a lot Titanfall and Simcity didnt even do that but thats because of the  hardcore gamers  who eat up every piece of crap the marketing departments and the journalists put out and later they are the same people who without fail come back and complain about the game. Yet these are the same people who associate indie games with shitty and AAA with modern. Thankfully indie gaming has risen again and were  starting to see a trend toward interesting hard and new games rather than the same crap year and year again. ,linux_gaming,cika6gb,9,t5_2r2u0

1962912,0,t1_ckpojng,Woah there! Who said the article requires developers to impoverish themselves? I think you may have wildly wildly missed the point here. As entrepreneurs of course youre expected to cut expenses as much as possible when setting up a business and yes if youre taking your own business seriously youll impoverish yourself as much as is necessary to get a start in creating a successful business. Thats what separates the successful people from the unsuccessful ones. Thats the very core of the entrepreneurial spirit. If you dont instinctively understand this then please dont start a business any time soon. We just took the responsible option of cutting our costs to as close to zero as possible to get going on our own business and make our finances stretch as much as possible. At what point is that not something a startup should try and do? And were not suggesting underpaying employees thats completely catastrophically missing the point.Now were financially secure and have built the game and sales from the game sufficiently we can live like KINGS in the North of England for competitively little money. Since we get x the accommodation and luxuries for the exact same money since our game is performing well now we can if we so choose live in a place x better than a Double Fine employee for the same money.  Its literally like our game makes x the sales it would do if we were in San Francisco.  TIMES MORE SALES. Just by being where we are. Drink that in. If we are ever lucky enough to sell a million copies one day its like three million Double Fine game sales. A thousand pound becomes three thousand pound. A million becomes three million. Ten million becomes thirty million.The fact that we continue to live modestly despite being in a financially good situation is entirely our own choice to provide longer financial security for the company.  As such Ive not had to worry for a single microsecond about money for a good couple of years. Its been so long I cant remember the last time I had a single money worry. Thats the exact opposite of impoverished. We could go somewhat crazy and live a party lifestyle with little danger to the companys finances instead of being spread thin by crippling operating costs of the business and we could live a life a Double Fine employee could only dream of without ever spending a penny more than the  a month they get. For we would effectively be getting  a month! Impoverished you say? Were not rich by any stretch but our location and cost of living makes it feel damn close. This is not to boast. If we lived in London or other expensive places in the south we wouldnt have this option. Our location offers us x the opportunity.No the way to impoverish ourselves would be to move to San Francisco where Double Fine is where cost of living is so ridiculously high wed get rd of the accommodation and luxuries we would here for the exact same money wed earn in sales from the game or if we matched our quality of life here our funds would diminish x faster  Our colleague and codirector who lives in Brighton a far cry from SF in cost of living but still higher than Newcastle himself expressed envious dismay at how low house prices are where we live. Living somewhere cheaper doesnt make you impoverished it gives you potentially in our case compared to SF x the extra funds to live off and develop of and has a significantly good effect on your quality of life. If we were to pay our employees what Double Fine do and hell if PZ takes off in huge ways in future maybe we will! they would be considered extremely wealthy people. They would be making the equivelent of a DF employee making  a month.I was in AAA game dev for a decade with several lead developer roles and have worked at places such as Ubisoft and Midway and I never even scratched  of an average DF salary. If I made the same I could probably afford to drink the finest Dom Prignon every night of the week. Youre totally missing the point.Location matters. And our location makes funding an Early Access x easier and Double Fines location makes funding an Early Access game x harder. And this x makes a huge huge difference that has culminated in the abandonment of their game. Further the fact this is the case is extremely relevant is a massive factor in the likelihood of any Early Access games success and this should be considered seriously by devs and Early Access customers alike. This is the point being made. Whos suggesting impoverishing anyone?Or are you basically implying that living in the area of the country we do is so terrible in itself as to count as being impoverished no matter how much more comfortable our lives are financially? That would be kinda gross.Hell go that extra step and move to Delhi in India! There your average Double Fine employee if paid the same would effectively be making  a month. Thats some horrible impoverishment going on there I admit! No they would literally be rich and could probably become equivalent to millionaires before long.The whole point is these games are sold on the internet. Locale of the developer is irrelevant beyond networking. Half our team are in a different country to each other. The developers creating DF could literally be anywhere int he world and Tim wouldnt have to budge an inch. And those people who backed DF would have their pledges last up to x longer and provide x the updates.Youre kind of making the reverse argument here.,linux_gaming,ckpqdw3,2,t5_2r2u0

2075691,0,t3_2indx9,Forgive the short response. Im on my phone.You can use grub to pick which SSD you want to boot into. It will give you a list of OS options to choose from so can keep windows on one drive and Linux on another as you said or simply duelboot from one drive with  partitions be careful with this option if youve never done it before.In Linux there is no C D E etc drive letters. You choose where to mount each drivepartition you can use fstab to automount to a location of your choice. Also Windows will not recognize your Linux drive by default since it will not be formatted in a way that Windows can read. Some addons can make Windows recognize some Linuxformatted drives.You can keep your TB drive formatted as NTFS rather than split it in half and basically duplicate all of your stuff on both partitions. This isnt ideal but its at least a way to share files.You will be able to keep your monitor plugged into the output of your ASUS card. No need to use the MoBo VGA. You will eventually want to install the drivers for the card though. Its up to you whether you want to go with the open source driver or the proprietary driver.,linux_gaming,cl3nywe,1,t5_2r2u0

2772832,0,t1_cnj6nrb,Ive just recently bought a Clevo laptop with an iHQ a GTXM and it is optimus enabled.There are a number of ways you can configure an optimus laptop in GNULinux all with their own drawbacks You can configure the nvidia proprietary driver to be always on and rendering these days to get good performance at the expense of some screen tearing and poor battery life. You can configure the intel card to always drive the graphics with the nvidia card switched off  getting poor highend D performance but great battery life and no vsync hassles. You can configure bumblebeeprimus to only enable the proprietary driver to render when you wrap programs in bumblebeeprimus. This is sort of a middle ground for the above two options  getting good but AFAIK not windows equivalent performance and still decent battery life. This may require a bit of configuration e.g. telling steam to wrap calls to games in bumblebee or primus.  You could possibly also run nouveau too but if youre getting a gaming laptop you probably dont care about that.Im happy with my laptop though I now rarely play games these days if I played more regularly the vsync issue might be more irritating. I also like to tinker and spent a bit of time right at the start customising bootup options and scripting enabledisable of the nvidia chip dependent on what boot option I select from GRUB e.g. a switch between the first two options I detailed above.Im just mentioning this as if you like to tinker and dont run games every day you might find optimus wont be too much a hassle for you. ,linux_gaming,cnj9egt,4,t5_2r2u0

We do have information that could be valuable to GOG this isnt just users complaining about things they know nothing about.It would also help if they would engage more with the Linux community especially if they commented on earlier suggestions to fix the password problem. We dont immediately make tickets and give the problem to someone else at least not until weve tried to solve the problem ourselves.Thats how Linux users I know have tended to act and I feel that GOG underestimates what we collectively know.

2949433,0,t3_2txdqy,You could try running the compholio branch of Wine it has a lot of extra patches in that help with game performance. That said Wine these days is generally very stable and I thought the point of PlayOnLinux was that it used the best version of Wine for a given game. Ive never used it though so I cant say much about that.They have a repo which you can add to install it via pacman on Arch instructions are here  Of course you should also check AppDB to see if there are any specific instructions for getting a given game to run such as adding DLL overrides or registry keys. I think this might be something that PlayOnLinux is supposed to do itself but youll have to do it manually with Wine. Most games dont require much configuration to get working these days though certainly Trackmania should run with no issues.I just tried Trackmania with that Wine build in a fresh wineprefix and it works fine. It did give some errors at the start and it started minimized but otherwise runs perfectly.Its also usually recommended to disable the in game overlay settings gt in game in Steam I think this generally works these days but Ive had some issues with it in the past so I keep it disabled. Youll need to run Steam.exe with nodwrite too or youll get no text.With this Wine build theres an extra checkbox under Staging in winecfg to enable CSMT this can increase performance of many games a lot though can cause additional issues in some. Another tip for performance on Nvidia cards you can use the GLTHREADEDOPTIMIZATIONS environment variable to increase performance again can cause issues in others but it helps in most games.

Even if you have msse you have to go out of your way to use the instruction correctly. GCC does not magically generate sse code for you. There is NO mistake with these optimizations. You literally have to spoon feed the compiler to correctly use these instructions. DUH it doesnt have sse by default nor does gcc they are not something you can just turn on and expect good results.

2983415,0,t1_co73qqr,Ive got well over  hours in ETS despite these issues thanks to some clever work arounds from the Linux users at least. Im not trying to discourage people or the devs. They make one of the best sims out there. I just think its important people understand the state of SCSs previous Linux games and the pace at which the devs have fixed Linux bugs.As an example one of the most annoying bugs to me is that  degree wheels like the Logitech Driving Force GT get limited to  degree every restart. It has to be reset with ltwheelconf before each start of the game. The center also gets set to about  degree to the right and force feedback stopped working over a year ago. Both of which dont have an easy solution yet. I first reported these issues in April  on SCS official Linux bug forum and the issues still exist in the most recent Linux version of ETS.Despite issues like that I still say its a great game and worth playing. Especially given its been on sale for as low as .! Its not an appealing genre to many people but the game can really suck you in somehow.,linux_gaming,co7888z,3,t5_2r2u0

Also it is MUCH MUCH easier doing timing when frames drop by half instead of any other increment. Imagine trying to fit something like  frames into a  Hz interval.

Not only is the performance actually better than it is on Windows but every mod Ive tried which is a lot works perfectly well on Linux. The mods also make it more in keeping with the spirit of Linux  a lot of the best things about Kerbal came from community development projects.Oh and its an incredibly fun game. It has this really engaging cycle where you start out planning a mission then go into designing the craft to get it done then have some skill and luck come into it where you execute the plan with the craft you built then something goes wrong and you have to improvise in the field with the tools you brought and then finally you come back with all the ingame resources you unlocked and all the new ideas you had and do it all over again. This hits a wide spectrum of emotional engagement as well  theres the more purely intellectual early elements but after youre three hours into a mission and everything depends upon touching down perfectly on whatever youre visiting then its as adrenalineladen as any FPS you could name.,linux_gaming,cquacvp,3,t5_2r2u0

There are very few of them that actually have anything worthwhile in there. The ROG machine for instance has all Asus hardware in there from their gaming offerings so they have custom parts inside there that you wouldnt get in any of the other machines so that is fine. The IBP machine is just a piece of shit. The Alienware one is a little better than the Xbone but not much and definitely not worth  right now. The best value overall from what I saw was things like the digital storm one where you can upgrade the hardware at least so it does offer that little added life to the product.

4036299,0,t1_crgb94n,gt First your statement that ram is a poor investment. insert logical and true advantages of having more ram that somehow still end up not taking into consideration that people are supposed to pay in order to get hold of itYou make it look as theres no reason to be reasonable with your purchases. Nobody can argue that the more you invest in your desktop the greater itll get assuming you dont spend money on overpriced crap whether ram is cheaper or pricier than ssds cpus mobos or any other kind of upgrade is completely irrelevant as long as the average desktop user is not in a mood for upgrading anyway. Its not as if were forced to upgrade and searching for the cheapest components yielding greater results. Do you understand my point on this yet? Lets move on...gt You have a VM you load for only playing games. So its not loaded when you arent playing games...Did I ever suggest that a system would get sluggish or less performant when the vm is off or that theres a constant need for it to be on? My point on this is that on real life examples of an average core .something ghz cpu and gigs or ram loading an additional os or any other program for the record WILL impact your performance to some extent be that greatly noticeable or not.  And hell a windows sessions is not just a few megabytes of ram or at least its not a few by my definition which is probably like anything more than half a gig or getting close to a gig is not just a few megabytes.... No matter how intense free it might get playing the same game in the very same session of windows same running programs etc and trying again the way you suggest is still going to end up resulting in justwindows achieving somewhat of a greater performance even by a slight. the vm might take advantage of some the linux buffer cache the same way wine sometimes is known to yield greater performance than windows due to the cpu governor yet outperforming merewindows in such a way seems extremely unlikely especially if using a ressource intense environment on the linux distro side.My greatest concern about the importance of what you suggest is still the same and unchanged and thats why I keep replying to this. Is there a single benefit for a new user that doesnt seem to want to use linux for the fun of it and the way the system works and wants a simple os to get their work done and their games played? Cause unless there is a single advantage in for them theres no reason to even consider that even if its as easy as press a button and get everything working  your game installed in the windows vm.Edit  Addition gt What I can argue with is why would it be any more busy? A reminder that its mere windows that Im suggesting that should outperform the above. Why be any more busy? Cause windows load lt windows  vm  linux load.,linux_gaming,crgda1a,1,t5_2r2u0

4166548,0,t3_38fhgg,I had this idea back a few months back and I had a different idea too which was similar which got picked up by phoronix. So the first idea was just kickstart the port it would only work for games with mass appeal but it would work so Blizzard could do it and maybe a few other devs but it would have to be games that get wider appeal. The kickstarter thing is risky but it could work. The second idea is less risky but slightly more crazy. What it would take is Canonical or RedHat since they both have the money to go to a game developer who doesnt have their games on Linux currently and footing the entire bill for the game. So they pay for the port and would be paid back for by the developer of the game and if they dont pay it back in full at least there is a game out there that is less of a blocker for people who want to switch. This one is more about removing blockers for people switching. People want Blizzard games specifically and might hold off switching if their games arent available on Linux. That is a fact. So Canonical saying here have k that is to fund  developers for a year to port all of your games to Linux then after that there is  less problem for people wanting to switch. Another example of a game people would want is LoL. There actually are only a handful of games that would block a lot of people from switching and this is a real option. ,linux_gaming,crv70ry,1,t5_2r2u0

4370108,0,t3_3b2lip,There are  different things of note. If you are running a really old card the open source AMD drivers are amazing. Fully recommended. . If you are running anything in the XX series you should be running fglrx which are shit drivers but provide a good experience but not great there are bugs. They just work better on fglrx in comparison to the open source drivers. . For the R and the XX series you are going to be running a new driver from AMD developed from the ground up with a mostly open source model. There will be a closed source part although how much will be in that closed part we dont know. It will be more than likely a better driver overall than any other driver eventually but it isnt pushed yet to the Linux kernel. It is going to be released around Linux . which is merging right now. For  and  which is what people are using right now you arent going to get a good experience overall and Nvidia is more recommended in that situation. For the newer AMD cards  you should wait because you could be waiting a bit for the driver to get good enough for daily use although it seems like they are doing the right things it will just take time. I do have a card sent out by AMD to test their driver when it comes out its a R which should be the best supported one when the new driver comes out. Ill be releasing video content and blog content regularly updating people on things so keep an eye on the subreddit. That being said we dont have a clue about the XX series yet or the Fury X more than likely the Fury X wont be supported off the bat but the  since its a rebranded  if I read the news correctly card im sure it will be supported eventually with the new driver if not supported right away when the patches land to .. Also Vulkan is a good thing to note as well. It should even the driver gap quite a bit since it reduces the driver complexity quite a bit. So it could change quite quickly when the dust settles with Vulkan which driver is better or even. TLDR Right now for  and  Nvidia beats AMD handly IMO for  we dont know yet but wait and see when it lands. ,linux_gaming,csi8vgw,6,t5_2r2u0

4680985,0,t1_ctkja7s,Making the switch complete is one of those things you have to research and then assess where you are currently and what your future goals are. I have used linux since  but was a console gamer mostly after I made the switch. When I decided I wanted to PC game again with the release of the new consoles I decided I would build a rig that solely ran linux and I wouldnt play any games that didnt run on linux. I did end up installing Skyrim via wine because it was a game I really enjoyed on the  and I wanted to see what it was like on pc. So for you I would say to take a look at what gamessoftware you currently like running what their status is on running natively on linux if they dont run natively check their status on running via wineplayonlinux and finally how they run via a virtual machine as it will be the slowest in my experience although some people may have different experiences and expertise with that especially with things like kvm. And then when youve finally gathered all of that information make the decision about how to move forward based on your future goals. For me being able to run linux was more important than being able to run every game. But that may not be true for you and thats okay. Just be honest with yourself before making a decision or else you can end up very frustrated. Ive tried to help a couple people make the switch before and its really frustrating for them and myself when all of a sudden there is some software andor feature that is a MUST HAVE and no alternative will do that they didnt think of until a week or month later.,linux_gaming,ctkl2le,3,t5_2r2u0

The other consoles are manufactured by one company and represent a massive financial cost which. That cost is only recouped if they achieve a certain number of sales and make that money back through those sales and the licensing fees on gamescut of game sales.Steam Machines are made by many companies theyre more like Android phones the risk of the cost involved in manufacturing the hardware is defrayed amongst many companies. And given that many Steam Machines are manufactured using entirely off the shelf components that cost is significantly lower even on a perunit basis.Also a Steam Machine isnt a fixed thing with a fixed spec it can evolve over time. The other consoles have to sell a certain number in a certain time in order to be profitable Steam Machines can evolve iterate adapt evolve and other such words. Steam Machines is really a loose standard rather than a particular product  much like the IBM PC or again Android devices.I would say just based on my own estimation that most indie games get Linux ports these days. And I think if Steam Machines only had indie games  thousands of cheap fun unusual interesting games that you could play on your TV thats still a really decent proposition that I could see having a decent market. Nintendo have proven many times that a weird console with a small selection of interesting titles can do really well.In short I think thinking of Steam Machines as if theyre in the same fight as other consoles or indeed other PCs is a trap and leads to faulty conclusions. ,linux_gaming,curyu8q,12,t5_2r2u0

5075096,0,t3_3khvwk,gtAs far as overall compatibility goes.. are there any particular distros to avoid? I am looking at both debianbased mintubu and openSUSE possibly Arch.If you want to jump right in and have things just work you probably dont want Arch. Its more aimed at powerusers. Debian Mint Ubuntu openSUSE and also Fedora are all fine.gtnVidia Drivers  OK whats the deal. There are open source drivers and proprietary drivers from my understanding. Whats the difference aside from the.. openness?Drivers in Linux work very differently than they do in Windows. Basically  of drivers are already programmed in. However the provided open source drivers are not made by nVidia and must be reversed engineered. nVidia provides very little support to the programmers of the free driver if any at all. As such it preforms very poorly compared to the official ones. AMD is more supportive of open source development but their closed drivers are slightly worse. Intel is completely supportive  the open source driver is the official one. But they lack the hardware power for it to matter.gtHow well updated are nVidia Linux drivers? Do they typically release on the same day as Windows drivers? And how do the open sourceproprietary drivers differ here?Not sure how quickly nVidia releases their closedsource driver Im currently using an AMD card. The open source driver is totally different and as mentioned before lacks many features.gtDEs  Ive read about some framerate issues on certain DEs. Do some perform worse than others?Not really no.gtDirectX . This concerns me more than anything. I know Wine is working tirelessly on DX... but hell not even Microsofts own products Win can run DX except for Win. Not to sound too cynical but this sounds really bad for the long term future of Linux gaming. Ease my nerves please...Its best to assume that only games with official Linux releases will run in Linux otherwise youll have plenty of heartache. Wine support can take years.gtThis ones a little specific.. but if anyone could possibly comment on how well ArkSurvival Evolved runs on Linux versus Windows that would be helpful.. since that game already runs like crap as it is and its one of the games I play most often.Not sure but some quick googling found some complaints so that is probably not a good sign.Linux gaming support has jumped leaps and bounds in recent years but still has lots of room for improvement.

5087041,0,t3_3kobzw,Valve promoted Ubuntu in the beginning and theyve helped develop tools to push for easier development on and for Linux.  Valve is using Linux so of course Valve wants Linux to succeed.That having been said I think its too difficult to know for sure what impact Steam Machines will have on Linux usage statistics since it depends on so many factors.  Even if its only a  bump up its still help Linux out a lot and will help knock down the chicken and egg problem.  Even  is still a good chunk of gamers especially for an open platform where there are fewer physical walls to break through like there are with traditional proprietary consoles by demanding that you own some specific piece of hardware.My hope for the future is a bigger promotion of Linux laptops and desktops by various vendors and a massive lawsuit against Microsoft to demand consumers have the choice of at least no operating system cost for an OS that they dont want when they purchase computerslaptopsetc.  At the very least they should be able to pull the device from the packaging remove the Windows serial label or put it on and decline the copy.

5382241,0,t3_3oqte6,gtI would love to install WildStar on Mint via Wine but once Open with Wine is used the waitaminuteImloadingyourcrap wheel spins then nothing happens. How do I install it?Apparently like many games the WildStar client only works in Wine . Make sure youve got Wine ..x installed instead of the older stable version that is available in the default repositories in Mint. Find out what version of wine youre running by entering    wine versionat the command line. If its less than ..x and it probably is if youve installed Wine from the default repositories that come preconfigured with Mint remove the version you have installed by entering    sudo aptget remove wineat the command line youll be prompted to enter your password and then follow this guide to add the repositories and install Wine ..x.gtI have games on steam that no longer are available to me on Mint. Id love to have them backThey are no longer available for you to install in the native Linux Steam client because they dont have a native Linux version. Install the Win Steam client as well and use it alongside the native Linux client. Download the Win Steam client by clicking the Windows link underneath the button to download Steam from the site. Then just run the exe like you would normally.gtIve tried researching how to use Wine how to use the Terminal or just about anything else on Mint and Im met with terminology and jargon which is never really defined and leaves me feeling confusion on a level of slightly panicked frustration I have never experienced before.Linux has a bit of a different learning curve than Windows does. Its not any more difficult anymore to use Linux than Windows but figuring out how to do basic things in Linux can be a bit frustrating if youre coming from Windows and have no idea where to even begin. You can get away with never using or or even seeing the command line in Windows and be fine but when using Linux youre going to have to use it for one reason or another eventually. But thats okay the command line is often a faster and more efficient way to accomplish a particular task.If you are going to continue to use Linux it would behoove you to familiarize yourself with some CLI basics like basic command line applications what repositories are and how they are used how to install and remove programs using apt and dpkg and what sudo is and how to use it Please bear in mind that Linux approaches user accounts and permissions differently than Windows does and that can be a big stumbling block for many new Linux users.It may seem a bit overwhelming at first and youre probably going to have to do a bit more reading than you would if you were using Windows but stick with it.,linux_gaming,cvzn4g0,1,t5_2r2u0

5483977,0,t1_cwchvde,Wine incurs a lot of issues though that cant be assumed for the user.  For instance lets assume a developer was willing to optimize their game to run almost natively on wine.  Do they optimize for Nvidia or for ATI? If Nvidia then you enable GL threaded optimization if ATI then I dont honestly know what you do.  Do you expect the developer to pick or to optimize for both to achieve near but not quite windows performance on their game?  Or do you expect the user to do this?  If you expect the developer to do this for still not native performance and to optimize for both ATI and NVIDIA as well as a range of other assumed configurations then why not just make a native port which will be easier to support and be better for your user.  If you expect the user to handle optimization then why not just use WINE on your own without Steam handling everything?

Theres a wide spectrum of how strongly people feel about the FLOSS aspect and how pragmatic they are regarding adhering to their feelings.But for the most part  Linux users have been starving for games pretty much forever.  There are some fantastic open source games but having the wider game development community pay attention to us the last couple of years has been fantastic.  In my personal opinion far more people will be thankful to you see Humble Bundle results time after time than would even think of deriding you for the license you choose.  But most of those people probably wont PM you to tell you  they will buy your game and think warm thoughts of you while they play it.  The people who are offended by your license choice are going to be far more likely to let you know about it.I hope you go forward with your port but just remember there are jerks in every community.My view is that your software freedom should include the freedom to use a license that I dont agree with.  Not that I care even slightly what license any given game dev uses but thats not the point.Good luck with your port and I look forward to it!  ,linux_gaming,cxwvhd5,5,t5_2r2u0
5930880,0,t1_cxwqd0q,gt Im not too keen on using steam due to the  cut they want to take.Very understandable but do keep in mind that Steam is also a platform that targets the exact audience you want to target.  Putting your game on Steam exposes it to millions of potential customers.  If its not on Steam you need to figure out some other way to advertise.  In addition to the store exposure.. Imagine one guy buys your game on Steam.  He plays it and steam broadcasts to all  of his friends that hes playing your game.   Now maybe  of his friends will look up the game to see what its about.. maybe two of them buy the game.. when they play it steam announces it to  more people that someones playing your game.  The pattern continues.  By the time you have  players  people are seeing one of their steam friends playing your game.  I saw my friend playing Victor Vran the other day and I went to go check it out and ended up buying it within  minutes... it works.So while Valve might take a big bite out of your paycheck its also the easiest way to get a paycheck in the first place.  Consider Valves  as your advertising budget.Also.. the vast majority of us dont care about games being open source or free.. we just want games to play.  I personally buy more games on Linux than I ever did on Windows.  Im happy to support a developer who supports us.

6021159,0,t1_cy8vuiz,What makes CUDA easier to use is its singlesource approach you write your host and device code in the same file marking device kernels with a specific attribute and you can launch device kernel with a syntax that is very similar to function calls with an additional set of parameters that represent the launch grid.This comes quite handy when youre doing rapid prototyping but as soon as your code starts getting sophisticated it becomes more of a hindrance than a benefit especially if you have to support a wide range of CUDA versions host platforms and toolchains since the singlesource approach requires the CUDA compiler nvcc to have pretty intimate knowledge of the host compiler.For example you can forget about using the latest gcc version with CUDA or even clang on Linux. When Mac OS X switched to clang it was quite bothersome and when they recently changed their clang version number to match their XCode version it broke CUDA again. And if you have mpicxx in the middle good luck getting it to work it can be done but its a lot of hassle.With OpenCL you have none of these problems since the device code is separate from the host code. The downside is that you need some boilerplate to compile the device code at runtime which is actually very practical when you have highly specialized device kernels for various runtime option combinations while CUDA sucks at this and even more boring boilerplate for the kernel calls.There are higher level interfaces to OpenCL e.g. SYCL but they have exactly the same downsides as CUDA so Im personally not a big fan although I can understand why people might seek them out. Actually the only thing that would make life easier for me would be just a stupid toolchain script to autogenerate the kernel call boilerplate and Im actually tempted to write one myself using clangllvm.Concerning device features yes extensions allow OpenCL to expose them as soon as the vendor wants for obvious reasons AMD does it NVIDIA doesnt.,linux_gaming,cy8wbrf,9,t5_2r2u0

I dont have much buntu experience but there are lots of people in rlinuxnoobs or rlinuxquestions wholl probably be able to help you to set up the system to you likes.About the current state it depends on your point of view Ive been playing exclusively in Linux for over  years so from my point of view it has come a long way there are many AAA games available and as a general rule Ive got more games than time to play.On the other hand most games only get released for linux sometime later if ever which means that the catalog might seem outdated to a windows gamer. And since most of them are ports they run slower than on Windows.With all that said I feel that if you choose to use Linux for your daytoday use youll have enough to play and at a decent framrate as long as you dont try to compare it with Windows which is actually unfair because windows has the vast majority of the market and has been so for many many years while linux came into focus about  years ago for the game dev community.As for the DirectX its going to be a long time theres only very basic compatibility so far.

8771156,0,t1_d71xkuq,There are a few different initiatives kicking around although Im having trouble remembering names and finding links right now. The traditional solution was the enterprise distro which kept the same kernel for  years but for a couple of years now RHEL has ended up refreshing the entire DRM subtree in order to make it easier to pick up new graphics drivers. This is a Good Thing overall IMO in the sense that major releases of the distro are not stuck with stinky old open source drivers but it does mean that different outoftree driver code is typically needed for each minor release. There is another initiative I was looking at a couple of months ago and predictably cant find today which involved tweaked kernels with stable ABIs over moderately short periods say a few kernel cycles.AFAICS there are only two approaches that really work  one is going allin on out of tree closed source and the other is going allin on upstream open source. Out of tree closed source has been the traditional solution inherited from the proprietary Unix world but IMO the end game will be upstream open source as long as we release support for new hardware sufficiently early to get into distros on time. We were doing that with APUs for a while lost a bit of ground during the radeongtamdgpu transition but should be back to having new HW support upstream well before launch for future HW.What this does is uses the kernel driver to provide a stableish ABI for the userspace drivers and its generally the userspace drivers which need to spin quickly for things like new gameapp optimizations.,linux_gaming,d722628,1,t5_2r2u0

Like I said before its rare to see a GOG version for a GNULinux game on the torrent sites and Steam is probably harder due to having more DRM. Gaming on GNULinux just isnt that popular even for the pirates.If they choose to go full GNULinux and wipe out their Windows install which most wil not it will be a huge learning curve for them and they will soon realize that they should have kept Windows due to the game selection differences. If this person goes out of their way to steal a game which will probably be cheap soon on a Steam sale or those grey market key sellers like GA they might as well just buy the game when comparing the time and effort to change their OS.I know it sounds like I am picking on the youth but according to this PC Gamer poll piracy goes down as people enter their mid s and s.

I have a Win drive a main Mint drive a Debian drive and an old  GB SATA drive that I use for tinkering with different distros.Since you can only have  OS booted at a time when you dual boot anyway.

Ill definitely pick this game up during early access assuming you end up going through with the port. Have you announced pricing yet?I know its been covered elsewhere in the thread but the Steam runtime should make porting relatively simple as long as youre not using any rd party libraries that have restrictive licenses i.e. no redistribution. As long as you stick to using the libraries from the runtime and make sure you package any other libraries you use with your game or alternatively statically link them it should run fine on any Linux system that can run Steam. Of the  Linux Steam games I have in my library Ive only ever had an issue with one game on my Arch Linux machine which didnt link to the Steam runtime correctly manually setting LDLIBRARYPATH fixed the issue since it was using libraries that were all included in the runtime.Just make sure it runs on the latest Ubuntu LTS which Steam officially supports and it should run everywhere else as well.

I just want to be pedantic about one little thing to help you understand our culture a little bettergt Linux binds the ltAltgt to OSspecific functionsThere are actually no OSspecific function keys at all but rather default key bindings for each desktop environment. They all tend to use Alt because it is available on every keyboard and matches Windows in fact Im surprised you didnt already run into a snag in that regard but any user can change this if they want. I personally use the Super Windows key for my DE functions which allows me to use Alt for custom key binds in various programs.That said my pedantry aside I appreciate that you took the time to notice that Alt was in use by the desktop environments default key binds and spent the time and effort to adapt your game to that.  CtrlAltF the VTswitching keys are the exception but I think those can be changed too.,linux_gaming,d8yqae5,18,t5_2r2u0

9395952,0,t1_d96xhbh,If you use separate partitions for most of everything you likely wont have much trouble using both Windows and Ubuntu. Theres a lot of good information on dualbooting them together on the Arch wiki One very important fact is that Windows uses Fast Startup which hibernates the disk instead of fully shutting down so you cant mount Windows drives that were shut down in this way when you reboot into Linux. Dont worry though thats not difficult to fix just turn that feature off to mount your Windows drive in Ubuntu as readwrite. readonly is possible with Fast Startup still but if you want to share a drive readonly wont get you much other than opening files. No changes can be made whatsoever. The simple idea of the shared partition is that it must be a filesystem both Windows and Ubuntu can read. Namely this includes FAT and NTFS however FAT has its own problems concerning mainly a maximum filesize so NTFS is your go to here. In regards to their advice on sharing drives you could do it a few ways. Have a Windows partition NTFS Ubuntu partition insertfavoritefshere and a shared partition NTFS which allows you to have things you want to access on both computers on that shared partition that would in Windows appear as D and you could mount to wherever you would like in Linux media mnt etc. You could also have your actual home partition as NTFS which you could mount on Windows without issue. Or you could have a single Linux parition NTFS and a Windows partition NTFS that would allow you to see both on either system. However youll be unnecessarily accessing all Linux system and program files. If you have your Ubuntu install as you would like you may want to look at how much space you have used in your root folders. This will give you a good idea of how much space youll need for home and for . Steam automatically assumes HOME.steam for installed games so you know. A setup similar to     dev    |    sda       root partition       unshared EXT linux systemprogram files      sda       home partition       shared NTFS user files on Linux      sda       Windows partition       shared NTFS user files on Windows       Fast Startup turned offor     dev    |    sda       Linux partition       unshared EXT linux systemprogram files      sda       Windows partition       shared NTFS user files on Windows       Fast Startup turned off         homearszilla symbollically linked to Windows user directories     etcfstab mounts partitions on bootWhich could be accomplished fairly easily. Install Windows first disable Fast Startup install Ubuntu delete directories under your users HOME mount Windows partition install NTFSG if necessary symbollically link to your Windows User directories under your HOME and then edit etcfstab to mount the Windows partition at boot as well.     etcfstab         ltdevicegt             ltdirgt         lttypegt    ltoptionsgt             ltdumpgt ltfsckgt    devsda                           ext      defaultsnoatime                devsda              mntwindows  ntfsg   defaults                    Your HOME directory would look something like    arszillakickasslaptop  pwd ampamp ls l    homearszilla    total     lrwxrwxrwx     arszilla   arszilla    Oct   Documents gt mntwindowsUsersarszillaDocuments    lrwxrwxrwx     arszilla   arszilla    Oct   Downloads gt mntwindowsUsersarszillaDownloads    lrwxrwxrwx     arszilla   arszilla    Oct   Music gt mntwindowsUsersarszillaMusic    lrwxrwxrwx     arszilla   arszilla    Oct   Pictures gt mntwindowsUsersarszillaPictures    lrwxrwxrwx     arszilla   arszilla    Oct   Videos gt mntwindowsUsersarszillaVideosNow anything you save to your Documents or Downloads will be in the same folder youd have them for Windows but youll still have your dotfiles separated so you wont see a bunch of files in your Windows User directory that have no meaning to you. I kinda of like this one the most. You could make the Linux partition also NTFS if you would like it will simply appear as a separate drive in Windows like D.

If Im way offbase could you explain what that patch note means and why it doesnt entail prime support?  Also did they ever give an ETA for when the Nvidia drivers will implement the new prime support?Also also in my graphics drivers list in Ubuntu the Nvidia drivers still say open source next to them but you still say things like only the free drivers have implemented these new features and the subreddit in general seems to dislike Nvidias Linux support.  Isnt open source the same as free?  Are their drivers not open source but labeled incorrectly or something?

If the gameisnt there yet then dont assume that somehow it magically will besomeday based on empty promises of a dev.If you can find a successful fun early access game that meets thealready a great game requirement chances are that game will continueto evolve until . release and often beyond that.I guess that was my point.

9868494,0,t3_5go0le,If you have to pick one then Id pick  bit there are a few issues with  bit libraries that are no longer installed by default which can cause support issues on some distros. Many distros more will be dropping bit libraries from being installed by default in the coming years so being bit saves you any burden of having to update your app in the future. It also aligns your Mac amp Linux releases on the same architecture which can help on the devQA side with bugs that are caused by  bit differences.  We had a few requests a couple of years ago when we released a bit title no  bit version but since then weve been mostly  bit with every release without any major requests for  bit. With our last couple I dont think Ive even seen a single  bit request. Depends on your target audience as the lower specolder you go the more people might have older  bit distros. But from our experience the transition to  bit is almost complete for  of the user base who use modern releases.

9926416,1,t1_db153az,Sry to tell you but you have a huge confirmation bias . Hearing a few numbers from developers that actually also support Linux games is no indication of the hole market. If youre selling a niche product of course your customers will consist of more people buying that niche product. Say you have a business of selling cars. If you have also electric cars in your product line your percentage of customers having electric cars increases. If you ask every customer if they have or maybe plan to buy an electric car in the future you would have more customers saying yes as opposed to one who does not sell electric cars etc.. Thus asking you about your average customer does not presenting the market as a hole. Lets pick another example a small Filmstudio makes also a living out of niche Movies  Documentaries about cats. Asking their customers what animals they like turns out everybody who loves watching movies tend to love cats! Do we have a correct projection of the hole marketshare? . You believing that it is not less than  does not matter. Only hard facts counts. Saying that having . from Netmarketshare . from Statcounter it sounds absolutely reasonable to have a market share slightly below  considering not every Linux user is playing games. Just look at the differences at market share from Netmarketshare amp Statcounter regarding win amp win it differs quite a lot towards win used by gamers than for the average joe. . What does you make believe that Valves number are definitely skewed? What facts do you have? A couple people saying i never get the Survey if i am using Linux the hole time and the one time i booted win  pops up!. This is totally biased and a well known phenomenon in the perception of randomness. If the survey is displayed random it is totally fine for this to happen. Random does NOT mean evenly distributed. Random is random and you cannot conclude on a particular small sequence if this sequence is random or not. If i gave you the numbers       that i have generated of a given random number process could you say that these are random or not? No you cannot because these are valid random numbers but the perception of people is that random numbers behave like this         somewhat evenly distribute no repetition no sequences and thus a random hardware survey has to occur every evenly distributed time period.. Practically no one seeing the hardware survey regularly on Linux andor Windows will complain about that. No car owner will spread the word in forums that his car did not break down this week every week. Only people that have a problem or are suspicious about something will reach out and tell their story. This comes back to the wrong perception of randomness. If something like that what happened to OP will occur to someone else  which is as i said absolutely within the range of randomness   we will read about that here. But you have never heard about me getting the survey every now and than and tell a story about that.If you have no other data backing you theory just your gut feeling about that topic is not making it definitely skewed. It is more likely that youre a victim of confirmation bias  sry to say that.              ,linux_gaming,db1fqsr,2,t5_2r2u0

The only issue I know about this is that now the steam overlay wont work for me in this game. That means I cant use the steam controller without using another workaround like sc controller. If you find a way to restore the steam overlay playing Civ V on Manjaro please let me know.For future reference you might also check the Manjaro forums in addition to reddit to see if anyone has had your problem.

And here i am not talking about the quality of the service itself because the experience depends on the game. If youre playing games like Batman where input lag is not that important youre good to go. I cannot recommend playing FPS games but that has nothing to do if youre playing on win mac Linux or your Android device smartphone or fire tv etc.. that is just an inherent problem by the streaming technology and the latency that comes with it. But you should try it yourself to get a picture because as i said the experience depends on the latency. I am quite happy with ms   ,linux_gaming,de73by8,2,t5_2r2u0

10948660,0,t1_de98yd1,Personally I like running with my libinput acceleration profile set to flat with DPI so that would make a big difference in my purchasing decision. I also like larger mice that fill my hands which would also have an impact in the decision. As for the price I have used ATech for the past  years which were around the  range until last year where I upgraded to a Kone XTD Optical  and I can seriously say I have never been more satisfied with a mouse and now fully understand why mice in these price ranges exist.Think long and hard of how youd ideally like to set up your mouse. Think of how youd like to grip it. Look at as many pictures and specifications of the mice you are interested in. Look at video reviews for them.

EDIT with actual helpful infoThousands of games run native thousands of Windows games run with WINE and hundreds ? of Windows games will not run.  Wait until those ones are released native or until they run in WINE and play the ones that do run while supporting developers who release games for us which helps to cause more games to be released for us in the future no tux no bux.  The more Linux gamers the more incentive that gives game devs to release for us.  There are emulators for consoles as well.There are lots of good distros but I recommend Linux Mint  Antergos Solus and Ubuntu are some others that are pretty popular.  You can also check out distrowatchIf you choose a static distro like Linux Mint or Ubuntu youll probably want to add a PPA for graphics card drivers especially if youre running an AMD graphics card.

No I have never used wine outside of CrossOver so I dont know what advanced wine configuration or galliumnine can do. But I believe that their bottle system where they make it easy to sort of have containers for different software you install is unique to them.
