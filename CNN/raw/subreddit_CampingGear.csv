127721,0,t1_cesn1af,Thanks you reminded me that I need to add a bit of tubing to my kit for my next trip.  I usually filter into a bottle.  I also have one of those tornado tubes used to connect two soda bottles.  If I cut down one end it should thread onto a soda bottle or bladder which could be nice if theres lots of blowing sand or bugs.  The next trip is a car camping trip so Ill get to try it out along with other things to see what adjustments I can make for backpacking.,CampingGear,cesz4y6,2,t5_2tru8

869029,0,t1_ch2m8lv,Its a pretty amazing jacket.  I have short legs  inseam and short arms S on a long torso ..   I weigh  at the end of winter with a  waistline and  at the end of summer with a  waistline.  Im somewhat broadshouldered for a guy my size D measurement is over .The jacket fits me great slightly longer in the arms than the Alpha SL.  The cut on it is awesome looks amp feels great on its own or over my downpuffy.  Its ridiculously articulate hanging low on the back to accommodate a harness but I think the Alpha SL might have been a bit longer.  Still with the longer arms you can reach in any direction without raising the jacket above your belt.  I preferred the watertight front zipper on my Alpha SL over the bigtoothed zipper on the Beta LT Hybrid but it does work betterfaster as a zipper.  Whether or not it ends up proving that the watertight zipper was unnecessaryoverkill remains to be determined.  Im guessing thats the case though.  They did keep the watertight zippers in the pitzips though.I dont know if youre a big fan of pitzips but I am.  It doesnt matter how well made your jacket is or what its made out of because any material is going to have a limit to how much moisture it can release at any given moment.  When I was wearing the Alpha SL in the rain and Id start getting very sweaty rolling down the window for a quick moment worked wonders.  I used them constantly amp was still surprised when I found one day that the entire panel that contained the zipper had come detached from the rest of the jacket. Arcteryx decided to replace it but my jacket was  years old and the new Alpha SL didnt have pitzips. So they upgraded me to the Beta LT Hybrid which as Ive said is virtually the exact same as my old Alpha SL except for the reinforced areas so no longer Super Light and the hood is different a separate collar aka Drop Hood as opposed to the Storm Hood which had no collar.  Back when I originally bought my jacket in  I was wearing a used Patagonia rain jacket that I cant identify. Heres a couple pics from the side amp from the back just to illustrate what Im talking about.  In the second picture you might be able to see the buttons on my collar because my hood is rolled up inside of it.  I really liked this feature.  So much so that I was having a hard time deciding on the Alpha SL because I liked the Beta SLs drop hood a lot more.  In the end the pit zips clinched the deal.  The Beta LT Hybrid then is basically the jacket I always wanted.  I will say that after  years of guide use the Alpha SL repelled all the weather and objects it encountered.  I never had any wear or tear in the areas that have been reinforced with Pro Shell on the Beta LT Hybrid but since the jackets super light designation isnt that important to me I pack light but Im not an ultralight gram counter Im happy to let Arcteryx make that decision.  tldr Alpha SL  Beta SL  Pro Shell reinforcements  Beta LT Hybrid aka dream jacket.  Caveats wary of normal zipper in place of watertightstyle zipper amp I wish the hood stowed away into the collar.  Based on my experience with the Alpha SL I dont have any reason to deny this jacket a  Star rating despite it being brand new.EDIT After writing this I discovered the Zeta LT Hybrid.  Which has the watertight front zipper and a stowaway hood.  sigh...,CampingGear,ch32ac4,1,t5_2tru8

Ive never need to though.I use a Neoair pad and really love it too! Its . thick! I usually take a thin closed foam pad and put under it because Im anal about my gear and dont want to chance popping it. A patch kit would be lighter to take instead though...

I have and love the Stratos  but would not recommend it for use as a bookbag  it has a tensioned suspension system on the harness part in contact with the wearers back which results in a stifflycurved internal compartment which would not mesh well with bulky flat books. I love it as a day pack though.. so comfy. I would recommend looking at the Talon . Ive never used the Talon line but hear nothing but good things from people whove reviewed it. I think the Talon  would likely be a bit too large for use as a bookbag not to mention it has a lid on top which I could see being annoying and just in the way when one wants to get into the bag frequently and the Talon  would likely be too small. ,CampingGear,cmkc92v,3,t5_2tru8

2859656,0,t3_2sudzs,Sorry to hear about your sore feet its really unpleasant!Id be interested in why specifically youve opted to go with boots rather than something like a trail shoe.The main reasons to use a boot are Stiff shank. The shank is a stiffrigid piece of plastic or metal that is generally positioned between the sole and the  missilecushioning of a boot. The point of it is to provide rigidity from the heel through to the toe. Boots tend to come in half  and full shanks starting from the heel and extending to the arch ball and boot end respectively. Generally speaking rigidity is a requirement for steep terrain where large amounts of weight may be placed on a relatively small surface area of the boot. For example front pointing with crampons requires a full shank. Insulation. Boots can provide a better degree of warmth for those cold winter treks.If youre not using either of these features there is really no reason to use a boot. There are disadvantages to using a boot that greatly out weigh their benefit Weight. Boots are generally much heavier than trail shoes. This requires more energy to lift every step you take. There is a saying that goes an oz on the foot is a lb in the pack. Warmth amp Breathabiliy. Boots are warmer and not as breathable as trail shoes. This leads to hot aches as well as moister feet due to perspiration. The end result is a higher risk of blisters and swollen feet. Stiffness. Boots are stiff both in the upper and in the cushioning. This means they need to be broken in. This may or may not happen. This is generally associated with pain in the arch or balls of the feet. Probably what youre experiencing... Trail shoes are softer and more cushioned so this doesnt really happen.Furthermore if youre worried about ankle support someone over is radvancedbackpacking compiled a list of articles on the equivalent risk of trail shoes and boots.Finally equip yourself with some trekking poles if you havent already. They feel awkward at first but after an hour youll be absolutely flying on the trails and arriving at camp with way less aches.I know Ive not really answered your question and have been quite preachy... But hopefully youll have a think about it and at least try out the shoepole combo. I imagine youll feel better for it!,CampingGear,cnt5748,4,t5_2tru8

Dont focus on reviews focus on what fits.  Its also fantastic to have a budget but dont be afraid to stray   .  You might find that the absolute perfect option is just right over .   While boots wont last forever their impact on your experiences are huge.  You want something that is going to make you happy.   If it comes down to a few bucks over budget hold off for a couple weeks while you scrap together the cash you need and come back to get them.Yes you could probably find those same boots cheaper online but they are cheaper because you didnt have someone fitting you providing feedback and helping you compare all the shoes in your range.   So please if you do go to a shop and find something you like please support the place that serviced you. is plenty of budget to find a great boot.  Most GoreTex boots are going to be a little closer the  range but you can find plenty of Waterproof anything waterproof that isnt GoreTex options in that area if that is a feature you want.,CampingGear,cqddj3a,2,t5_2tru8
3718554,0,t1_cqg4r6s,I understand that. Ive tried. The three features Ive listed seem to be linked. Hip pockets seem to go hand in hand with padded straps and theyre the absolute top item on the list. Im after a set of hip pockets with a backpack on them more than a backpack with hip pockets. The only other feature Ive got listed I can drop is a hydration bladder pocket but again pretty much any pack that has hip pockets seems to have some sort of bladder pocket. Seems like Im stuck with either all or nothing which is why I made a thread asking if anyone has seen any packs that I may have overlooked before I decide to pay more. ,CampingGear,cqg53tb,1,t5_2tru8

4184914,0,t3_38p3fc,Theres a few commenters here suggesting leaving the pack cover which will save you some weight. However some packs are made of material that will soak up water pretty well and become much heavier after being saturated with water. If you are willing to spend money you should look at The big  Backpack TentShelter Sleepingbag and Pad. As these are the items that will weigh most they are also where you can save a lot of weight by changing them for lighter alternatives. But as I said it could set you back a few dollars. Unless you make your own gear.  on using Lighterpack or other service to get a good overview of your pack. ,CampingGear,crxa6vh,2,t5_2tru8

4287190,0,t1_cs8kdwk,No since you are in a cabin you will not need a canister unless the rangers tell you that you need one. Just be sure to keep trash inside or use whatever bearproof dumpster they might have outside the cabin. While you are hiking in you might want to put your food in something like this  It will block the odor from leaking from outside the bag which will probably reduce the odds a bear would get curious about you because it smells stuff. Just be sure to put everything with a strong odor soap bug spray etc. in the bag except the bear mace.Also bears that you see are mostly just curious or going about their day. Read up about what to do if you encounter a bear. The general consensus is to make noise while hiking talk occasionally bang trekking poles etc.  no need to go nuts so that bears know where you are and can avoid you. If you do see a bear stand close by your girlfriend wave your arms and make some noise or yell Hey Bear so it will notice you and go on about its business elsewhere. According to one thing I read boat horns also show some promise. Some get a little persistent but bear attacks are rare after all. And if a bear does come after you thats why you have the bear mace. A study showed it worked in about  of all aggressive bear encounters with both black and grizzly to prevent injury and those injured only had minor injuries. Guns are about  effective and there were multiple cases of fatal injuries. Bear mace is more protection than even a gun. If that alone doesnt convince you read some of the reviews on Amazon about bear mace. I like this one in particular TLDR Use some minor precautions and you wont have an issue. Carry bear mace for extra insurance but you most likely wont need it.,CampingGear,cs8vyes,2,t5_2tru8

The main attraction to me aside from the multiple functions is that its solar powered.  So far that part has worked great theres a little battery indicator at the bottom of the face and if Im not wearing it as long as I keep it in a room which gets a little bit of light from the outdoors it stays fully charged.I havent tested the barometer or altimeter yet for accuracy.  Nor the thermometer but the other multifunction watch I had was pretty much always telling me my skin temperature the only way I used it was to take it off at night so I could see how low the temperatures were getting low s Fahrenheit in New Mexico in January.As the other poster said compasses on watches are unreliable so on the trail I always have an ordinary compass.  Still if Im in an unfamiliar city even a rough idea of north can be helpful.If literally all you need is time and date you should easily be able to find something for  or less.

Here are my impressions vs my previous generation Flash  Belt and straps are better padded and more comfortable Lumber pad is nicely situated and not overly stiff to me Back venting felt nice and comfortable Adjustable torso length helps to dial in fit. Belt seems largerlonger allowing it to better reach all the way around to the front of ones hips. Shovel pocket is better imo than the single unpartitioned kangaroo pouch in previous years. Stay design seems like it will lend to better load transfer to the hips. IMO my REI Flash  was pretty terrible for this above lbs. Cant really judge that too well in store though. A bit heavier but the weight is probably mitigated by better and more comfortable load carry.

6779649,0,t3_48kno7,kelty tn just nice at . lbsoz .kg makes it lighter than most of tents in that range while still being roomy enough though a bit less than the options you mentioned. why i chose it? it was my first tent and it was the only tent at that price range for which i could find a large number of comprehensive endorsements for it online haha. but its a workhouse used it for nights so far no issues held up to mph winds no leaks. you could get a salida  for cheaper but you get one door and this was the dealbreaker for me why i blew a more bucks on the tn you dont get dac poles. tent materials are comparable though. theres also a stargazing feature that i found myself using more often than not even though i thought it was gimmicky at first.for me its the stormworthiness that mattered since i tend to ship off to scandinavia for backpacking and lord knows how fickle the weather is. my understanding is that the poles used are marginally stronger than other dac options it uses dac pressfit as opposed to dac featherlite which is as its name suggests lighter but slightly weaker although given dacs reputation thats not saying a lot its still pretty fucking strong. someone correct me if im wrongmaybe there are more stormworthy tents at this price range but for a complete newbie who didnt know what to look out for it seemed like the best option at the time and its held up well. tldr its marginally lighter than other tents at the cost of being marginally smaller. had more comprehensive reviews online. also dac pressfit bitchez.,CampingGear,d0kr9t5,1,t5_2tru8

7255348,0,t3_4e9n0c,Our scout troop uses chuck boxes. Heavy beasts made of wood. They need a minimum of two scouts depending on sizeage to move them and two more to install the legs although one can do it in a pinch.Personally I have an old Campmate camp kitchen box which I love. However  when fulled stocked it is heavy. Most of these options do not pack down very small either limiting their usefulness based on the type of vehicle you have.I use mine for trips of  days as I enjoy using it. However my system is easily set up by one person and I have an aluminum collapsible table that is the perfect fit for the box.I always wanted to make an aluminum version of my Campmate but I have neither the skills or materials to do so and a wooden version would easily weigh twice as much as the empty Campmate.They are popular for the expeditionoverland crowd. I have seen some really nice units integrated into the rear hatch for an SUV or similar vehicle.Biggest issue I have seen is size and price. There are some really nice ones that are made commercially but the cost is ridiculous. As a result a lot of people make do with simple bins with some form of internal organization. I have seen some pretty cool ones built into larger Pelican boxes too although they are on a much smaller scale than a larger traditional chuckbox.,CampingGear,d22vqjz,1,t5_2tru8
7286928,0,t3_4f3cwv,For the lightest weight would recommend a wide Enlightened Equipement down quilt rated to  degrees with  fill power down.  The movement backpackers not car campers has been away from mummy style bags towards quilts.  Some manufacturers have put out crossovers like the Sierra Designs backcountry bed.  In a mummy you dont have a free range of movement the hood opening will stay pointed upwards if you turn your head to the side all the down and material under your body become useless as insulation and are therefore dead weight.  People have a hard time jumping to the quilt.  If you want to practice the idea unzip your bag flip it upside down open zipper on the bottom and sleep under it as a blanket.  We wear a hat which we already carry anyway to compensate for the lack of hood.  If you dont want to jump to quilt...  These specs can help you with your search  EN rated to  degrees.   fill down.  Goose or duck doesnt matter.   ounces fill weight.  Drydown any water repellant treatment they have different names is preferred but not absolutely necessary. Extra length is better than too short.  You can always use extra length in a bag to put clothing items water filters batteries gas cannisters that you need to keep warm to avoid freezing.  Boxed baffles to hold the down you dont want stitched through that youll find on the cheap Chinese imports.  Down acts as insulation by being fluffy i.e. the height the insulation produces is more important than how much down is in the bag.  Dont get synthetic even though you fear getting the bag wet etc...  A. you never get the bag that wet unless youd drop it directly in a river and B. A synthetic would not be warmer if soaked it would be just as ruined. C. Synthetics degrade over time regardless of the care.  They lose insulation properties within a year.,CampingGear,d26h3r4,2,t5_2tru8

9076427,0,t3_54izpo,  You should be able to find cheaper  or  man tents at Target or Walmart though maybe theres nothing near you? If not you can check Amazon theres tents like the ALPS Mountaineering Lynx  Its listed at lbs which is a bit heavy for a P tent but to get much lighter you need to spend a lot more. Since youre only going  mile you can get away with a cheaper  tent... you can leave the heavier family tent in the car in case something happens you could always walk and get the backup tent. But dont go too cheap since theyre more prone to failure and thats just wasting money.  Do you have a compression bag? Theyre stuff sacks with straps you sit on the bag and compress it as much as possible and then cinch up the straps does save some room. You could get a lighter weight bag but again use a compression bag to make it as small as possible. To get really compressible you need to move up to a downfilled bag but those tend to cost a lot more.   If youre not hiking too far then I dont think its worth the money to upgrade the blue tarp works great just a little heavy. If youre putting on a lot of miles then I wouldnt want to carry the weight of a blue tarp... but also not really inclined to carry the nylon tarp either. Its certainly nicer to have but if moneys tight its probably better to put it towards a nicer pack.   L is a bit small to carry a synthetic bag and a family tent. If you can compress your bag or get a new one get a smaller pP tent then you might not need to upgrade the bag at all. If youre not hiking that far you can still strap things to the outside of the bag and not worry about losing it since its not too far to walk back and pick up.

If you can get a pad into position and keep it in place  it can be a light compact and relatively inexpensive way to keep your backside warm and you can use it big you have to sleep on on the ground. Two layer hammocks can make pad management easier. Pad extenders can help too. But nothing is like the hammock experience with an under quilt.  You get to lie on the smooth supporting fabric without lumps or bucking as can happen with pads.  Dont even think about not bringing bottom insulation unless it is tropical. ,CampingGear,d8jgm5t,4,t5_2tru8

Example someone asked if they would ever going start making womens jackets in Smallpetite they said No. Because they think they wouldnt sale enough of them yet there were  females in the room that nodded their heads also clearly a size small likely smallpetite including a friend of mine. Afterwards she said she felt frustrated almost to the point of getting rid of her Atom LT hoody in spite of that. I convinced her not to but still makes me not care to buy anymore arcterx stuff unless it fills a niche that no one else can.So I hope this explains why I am a little sore with arcterx.

10099411,0,t3_5kgc89,gt Gamma LT vs the Atom LTGamma LT is a softshell with no lining.  Gamma MX is fleece lined but its purpose is quite different from being an every day jacket.  It is a high performance active layer for alpine conditions.  You can use it as an everyday jacket but there are bettercheaper things for that purpose since you wont be using the main features of Gamma MX that youd be paying for.gt but Ive heard that even simple things like sitting in a chair with it thus compressing the back can irreparably damage the jacket.The jacket slowly degrades from compression depending on how much it is compressed and so on.  Thats part of having a synthetically insulated jacket and it takes some time but it is noticeable after  years.  Unless you need the light weight of synthetic insulation I wouldnt go for something like Atom LT.gt In addition if the jacket does partially lose loft would it still be warmer than a fleece jacket?Atom LT is not any warmer than a proper fleece jacket honestly.  Its a lightly insulated wind shirt great for use in the mountains in summer.  What temperatures are you planning on using it in anyways?  Maybe you should be thinking about Atom AR if you are considering it because a fleece  windproof jacket is not enough.,CampingGear,dbnytu0,4,t5_2tru8

10693936,0,t1_ddiqkig,Sure its a pretty neat system! The filter itself is a little cylinder with threads that you can screw onto a number of different water bottles and pouches. You fill a water bottle or pouch with dirty water and then squeeze the water through the filter into a bottle pouch or right into your mouth or just hang it up and let gravity do the work but most people are impatient and just squeeze. Its pretty versatile because the filter itself is very compact and light and you can use it with a bunch of different water containers put it into the hose of a water bladder and filter as you go or even use a straw and slurp directly out of a lake or stream or cup.So the included pouches arent necessary most people just use a smartwater bottle or something.,CampingGear,ddj00my,3,t5_2tru8

What makes you think these clone BA tents are any different?  The tent market isnt a huge industry so for a Chinese company to start up and copy some random tent company is not how china works.  China works by selling off brand names of products they are commissioned to make by big brands cause they are not punishable by US copyrightpatent laws.  Chances are the Naturehike tents are made by the same people making Big Agnes and probably other brands.  We know material wise that a  lb Big Agnes tent material cost wise costs about  so for the China shop to sell them at  the price doesnt mean its cheaper quality theyre still making a huge profit.,CampingGear,ddzifxx,3,t5_2tru8
