990999,0,t3_25fk34,I like the advice here about getting to a few community college courses before you make a commitment to borrow a lot more money. Maybe youve been thinking about this for decades and putting it on a pedestal when the real experience isnt really what you thinking it will be. OR maybe you will feel fulfilled when you finally go for it. At the very least youll prove to yourself that youre capable of finishing the course and it wont feel as daunting as going back for a degree.Have you thought about going through some online courses to get a feel for the math etc? is a repository of math video lectures from algebra to differential calculus. Or check out OpenCourseWare or Open Learning Initiative for some more advanced classes on a variety of scienceengineering topics usually with lecture notes and assignments or even tests included. Its easier now than ever to get your feet wet without setting foot on a campus.I agree that paleontology doesnt offer much prospect for a paying job and astronomyastrophysics are really math heavy. You have to think about what is really employable and what the dayto day life is like in the position. Or I have no idea how employable this is what about science art or illustration? Its never too late you just have to find a way to make it work for you. You will be way more focused organized and motivated than most people who had to raise their hand and ask for permission to go to the bathroom a year or two ago high school. You survived your upbringing of course you can get involved in science if you put your mind to it!gtI want to contribute something to the progress of mankindBeware that most jobs dont actually feel like that when youre there.

1680445,0,t3_2dlazi,I think others have given you good advice from the relationship side of the house so Ill just add the following.umsobelle made an excellent point.  Government positions tend to have less employee churn than others but all it takes is an administrative change or congressional or economic shift for funding to change for your organization and for staffing to change as a result of that.  Id also suggest thinking about setting up a meeting with a financial advisor.  While the salary stagnation issue may be offset now by housing and vehicle allowances the reality is that salary stagnation has very real measurable effects on your long term financial stability.  NPR just did a really great article on this for male bluecollar workers who are basically making the same salary today as they did  years ago.  An advisor could help you and your husband with projections so that you could see...hey this job will be fine for now and perhaps for the next five years but if cost of living increases continue at x per year by  we will need to consider other options.  That also gives you both time to be strategic about where to go if you have to consider relocating and time to look for a replacement position that really suits you.  It gives you time to add additional skills to your arsenal which you can use to market yourself effectively too.Personally we have the who outearns who rule in place.  For the first  years of our relationship he outearned me.  But now I outearn him.  So if a relocation for my job is in order then thats what well do.,LadiesofScience,cjqze8p,6,t5_2sg5m

Dont make the reader distinguish between tiny purple diamonds small lavender squares and microscopic royal blue pentagons! Its OK to use color but the legend should not depend on it if at all possible. Think about how your figure will print in greyscale or look to color deficient colorblind people.

3191467,0,t3_2wnu4y,Ive been very nearly where you are and it sucks. My husband and I had agreed on locationcity both had great postdoc offers at schools in NYC. I accepted mine he was still mulling and suddenly got his dream job postdoc offer in CA. oOIt was his dream job how could I argue with that? I was getting my dream postdoc and while his postdoc offer in NYC was great it was not the exact direction he was hoping to go with his postdoctoral research. The offer in CA was working with an amazing lab world famous PI doing exactly what he wanted to do. In the end he took the offer and we did long distance for a year until I was able to land a second postdoc at the same university. That year of long distance was incredibly stressful with lots of teary venting to my best girlfriends from grad school. BUT we made it through it and then I got to choose our next location.  Well more or less. We found a location we both love but I took the lead in the tenuretrack search and he followed me as the spousal hire. One thing I learned from the experience is that with academia you have to be a very flexible to opportunities as they come up and things are pretty much up in the air until you sign on the dotted line.

3306427,0,t3_2xynxr,There are lots of really good and practical suggestions here already. I just want to chime in with a pep talk.Mistakes happen. To everyone. Even your flawless grad student probably!As a relatively senior grad student who has mentored my fair share of undergrads let me tell you you are EXPECTED to make mistakes. In mentoring you your grad students job is to set you up for success as much as possible to show you a bright and promising student that research can be fun and exciting in order to lure you into going to grad school yourself and to help you make sure that as much as possible you make little mistakes e.g. you need to repeat the experiment instead of big ones e.g. you somehow break a  microscope in such a way that the whole lab now needs to go to the hospital.It sounds like your grad student is doing his job and that you are doing yours. I wouldnt worry about it. But if you are talk to your grad student or other grad students in your department. In my department this conversation tends to happen about once a year and it usually turns into an impromptu session of oneupsmanship among the grad students in which were all regaling the undergrads with our worst and most disastrous mistakes. They always feel better afterwards. You might try something similar P.S. Its not uncommon for PIs to expect perfection but this is never the reality in the lab. Disappointing your PI with your individuallystupidbutstatisticallyinevitable mistakes is part of a Grand Tradition in academia. Welcome to the party.,LadiesofScience,cp55qbp,2,t5_2sg5m

I started out as technician and have been promoted a few times.. I would suggest completing CITI training and adding that to your resume on my phone so no link. If you are currently affiliated with a university it should be free. I think this is usually required by most places to do any human subjects research. . People probably arent going to care about the specifics of your lab work but its nice to know you can at least use a centrifuge and wont be grossed out by blood. This is also a good area for highlighting attention to detail and organization. . If you can find a way learn how to draw blood thats also a HUGE plus. A lot of times we have nurses to help with this but its still good to know.. Experience with patient interaction is really the most important part. You might have to start out as a clinical research technician or some equivalent before you can become a full fledge coordinator. You might try to find a way to volunteer at a hospital.

Youd be part of project teams sit in on the meetings and be able to provide input and suggestions. At my last company? Probably less so. Your direct boss and team peers would likely be the majority of your interaction group. A lot of this is because the project teams were ENORMOUS at that site so corraling a team of  is typically done by funneling information through the reporting structure. Youd make a suggestion to your boss whod consider it and move it up the chain if theres agreement.  And yes my specific team is made up of entirely PhDs. Heck even going into my postdoc it was a mind blowing day when I got to orientation. The room had about  people in it and they had us raise our hands by degree.

Also if she isnt willing to take you back after  years because she doesnt like the idea of you growing as a person before taking on a career she wont do much to let you grow as an employee when you work for her.  No employer in any industry should be angry and hold it against you if you leave because you want to excel as a person heaven forbid you have dreams and inspire to push yourself. If you ever experience this in your career path take it as a giant red flag you need to get out of there.,LadiesofScience,d6cjms8,10,t5_2sg5m

9485614,0,t3_5aoj0d,My program has pretty similar numbers   female faculty out of  though one is retiring. After she retires there will only be one posttenure female faculty in the program until the other two go up for tenure. And we are hemorrhaging students. Many students leaving with Masters and many students switching labs. I think this is partially due to the lack of female mentors but also because the rampant sexual harassmentdiscrimination that was allowed to take place in our program the last few years. And yes those are probably very related. Ive worked to bring Title IX and sexual harassment training to our programdepartment and I hope that these will create positive changes. ,LadiesofScience,d9ib04z,15,t5_2sg5m
10941034,0,t3_5wa03w,Have you read the excellent book Lab Girl by Hope Jahren yet? Shes a scientist who found what may be a lifetime lab partner. He the lab partner has maybe a BS and only after he started working with her  for her in earnest.  She gets funding to pay him whereever she gets an appointment which I imagine would be pretty tough given that he doesnt have an advanced degree.  Maybe you could do something like that. Start doing citizen science types of work start talking to the researchersPIs who are needing the volunteers. If youre doing something with plants for an Ecologist and you really like the work then talking directly with the PI will give you insight into whats open for you and what next steps to take.  Hopefully things wont be dire with funding  no funding with the new administration and their willful ignorance of the role science plays in everyones lives.  Note Im not a scientist. Just an enthusiast.,LadiesofScience,de8ho7n,11,t5_2sg5m

11373502,0,t3_6248l0,As a field biologist I very very rarely am required to wear FR clothing and steel toed boots though other essential clothing such as fitting field pants with ACTUAL pockets waterproof snake boots chest waders etc. can be exceedingly more difficult to find for comparable prices to mens wear.... it is SO frustrating for me to find appropriate gear that fits as I am a fairly petite woman. My husband also a field biologist can find what he needs in minutes. ,LadiesofScience,dfl5zep,4,t5_2sg5m
11394083,0,t3_62emqe,Im an environmental engineer and field work is a pretty big part of my job.  While i was pregnant i didnt work on sites with much contamination all were postremediation so in theory there may have been low levels of contamination mostly from petroleum.  I felt really guilty because my coworkers were really busy on a PCB investigation but bosses agreed it was not a good plan to risk exposure.  That agreement was after the female company president stepped in.  My male boss said it wasnt fair to not expose me while the other folks were risking exposure.  Anyway.I took  months off postpartum which was ok.  It felt too long and not nearly long enough.  I came back at part time in theory  hours a week.  Now i work in theory  days a week but i havent worked less than  in about  months and often work  hours a week.  I do feel a lot of guilt because my daughter is in daycare so much.  The women there are amazing but theyre not me.  I breastfed and that helped keep me out of the field since i used lunch breaks to go to daycare and feed my daughter.  I also had to pump  times a day which they gave me an empty office to do.  The office is not private glass doors only accessible outlet puts me in everyones eyesight but i felt like i couldnt say anything.  Once i stopped breastfeeding a little after a year i was back in the field.  I think no one wanted to make me pump at a construction site or in our dirty work vehicles.I feel bad because my coworkers sometimes put in longer days but im restricted by daycares hours.  I think it slowed down my career a little bit but because i work for a women owned small business there is more leeway.  The other three women with children work flexible hours as well.  Theyd rather keep a good employee at less hours than try to replace us.  I got a good raise at my past review so even though i am part time i think they are really happy with my work.  ,LadiesofScience,dfni4r4,2,t5_2sg5m
