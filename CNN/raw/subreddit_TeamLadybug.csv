7481669,0,t1_d2sg3nb,Id gotten super lazy with tracking for some reason I feel like I can just total it up in my head. Also my dad eyeballs a lot so when I try to figure out how much of everything he used its always about soandso measurement and it would feel rude to refuse this awesome home cooked meal and have a lean cuisine instead because calories. Im hoping we learn to make smaller portions since now its just two of us eating and were both trying to lose weight. Soylent had appeal because then I wouldnt need to think about my next meals preparation would be quick and easy I.e. Nonexistantand I wouldnt actually have to eat an idea that has appeal when Im really down. Considering it now it does seem boring and unsatisfying and I like different foods way too much I just need to stop snacking late at night and count my calories.Thank you for the kind words and making me feel like Im not being lazy for letting exercise take a backseat for the time being! Ill definitely look at that sub progress pics from others are a huge motivator! Thank you!!,TeamLadybug,d2smgqm,1,t5_3dwek
