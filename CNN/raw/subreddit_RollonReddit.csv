9458852,0,t1_d9eyw2g,Aeva had a very brief crisis internally. On the one hand this seemed to be the man her group was supposed to find and interrogate about his involvement with the band that had killed Jasons companions. It wasnt exactly a huge leap to make the man had come in like he owned the place and everyone fell silent Ameiko had appeared extremely shortly thereafter despite Aeva herself who had realized her own star power around town despite having no clue what to do with it had waited through the brief busy period patiently. They spoke the same language and the shouting more than implied familiarity especially since no one was helping Ameiko for fear of... something. Something implied power that the man seemed to lack physically. No armor. No weapons. He wasnt a thug. He was someone with pull in town just like Ameikos father supposedly had.Aeva had come to try her hand at talking. At negotiating. At being useful to her new companions in a way other than as a rugged natureraised demigod of violence. The scene that was playing out before her was all the opportunity to do this essentially giftwrapped for her and shoved across a table for her to open as she pleased and experience for the first time the warm fuzzy feeling of intervening with words before weapons and solidifying the temporary family shed found with her ragtag band turned local heroes.And she considered this... for a moment.But whether this man was really Lonjiku Kaijitsu Ameikos father or not didnt matter in the end especially since it was only a possibility. Seeing a large man attempting to bully someone smaller than them related or not screaming like an angered badger all the while brought flashbacks of giants and their cruelty smashing to the forefront of her thoughts. Hatred burned in her heart as she stepped forwards less like a demigod and more like a demoness. Justice would stand. She would not allow this. She could never allow this. She was unable to even comprehend the apology she would have to make to Jason if this was Lonjiku through her blind range. He had insulted her father. He had pushed her too far and Justice would stand.Without a word without hesitation without mercy and without even considering the possibility of subdual she pulled back her arm and sucker punched the man across the cheek immediately spinning him round and following up with the other to jerk his neck to the opposite side.Attack  Damage  Attack  Damage  Diceroll Screencap,RollonReddit,d9ez652,4,t5_3h0dl
