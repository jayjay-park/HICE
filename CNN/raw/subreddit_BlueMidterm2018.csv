A spokesman for the Young Patriots attends a meeting of a group of concerned citizens from Lincoln Park. Theyre mostly yes white liberals. The spokesman begins to talk about being poor and about the police. Oh God says the chairman bored weve all heard this so many times before. He is resentful The meeting was called it appears by a clique that wished to congratulate itself on its progressive views. How embarrassing to listen to a hillbilly who doesnt even know hes using clichs.gtBut no. The group decides to let the hillbilly talk. This is the ultimate in liberalism isnt it? To be bored by someone rather than admit you feel superior to him? And this leads us to the films most poignant moment of revelation. gtFor when the liberals from Lincoln Park talk to the Young Patriot and ask him questions they are condescending! They use simple words. They talk slowly clearly afraid that otherwise he wont understand.gtAnd the joke is the film has already demonstrated that this young man and his friends have a higher degree of verbal facility talk faster more colorfully than these people who condescend to him. But whats your program? a concerned citizen asks him. If you had a concrete proposal . . . says another. A third suggests he take his ideas to his grownups. A fourth says that if the Young Patriots could get a program organized the Lincoln Park group might be able to help . . . might even indeed get it in Roykos column. a concrete solution could start with understanding rural america and avoiding being a lincoln park liberal.gtIm sorry that you dont like the generalizations of the rural ideologythe rural ideology you describe doesnt exist and your inability to learn from especialyl that post about non white people in rural areas is a bit shocking. gtListening to the nonfacists of Oklahoma isnt a solution.in fact it is. voting democrat is not all there is to politics. listening to people who everyone else refuses to counts as a political act  a start to be sure but without making that start you cant move on to any other concrete solutions because you wont be in a place to be able to execute them or to discover them or whatever else. concrete solutions will lie in grassroots organizing at the local level but as the sj political scene has gone into detail about  social cultural views matter and rural people feel that acutely too whenever they see tv shows that portray them all as white trash and realize they exist adrift in a culture that doesnt support them or acknowledge them or listen to them that sees their lives as backwards and sees them as garbage. the first movements towards gay marriage started with listening to gay people about gay experiences started with slowly normalizing being gay slowly changing the cultural perception. your attitude is one that causes the rural backlash against democrats. heres a concrete solution  contribute to something like say not letting people get away with saying rural areas are white anymore given how you should have learned how that just empowers the local racists. dont let other people get away with your backlash inducing attitude. drip in the bucket.gtTelling me what they want is a solution.listening to them tells you what they want,BlueMidterm2018,dbxjw74,1,t5_3hg2j

That one vote will not give them a veto proof majority they are well above a majority but also well short of veto proof one. They gain nothing in this scenario literally the only downside is embarrassment. In the scenario the Green wins Honkala will now have a platform for two years from which to turn the house into a circus the media will go as apeshit as they did during the  San Francisco mayor election and Id bet my last dollar that Honkala would use her newfound exposure to fuck us over in the Governors or Senators election in  as they are all too happy to spoil elections for us whenever they can. I will not help give them a platform to do it no thank you.Now if youre asking would I prefer a republican to a green in every race? Hell no.

11051820,0,t1_dekojsv,Here is the thing.  Best case scenario Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate.  She had over  years of Republican attacking everything about her.  She has moved from Rockefeller Republican to supportingleading Third Way Democrats to being more liberal than Obama in the Senate.  She was old for a candidate.  In  she could not beat a person who had not yet served  years in the Senate and who was only a state Senator before that.  So she had baggage and was not a good campaigner.  That was all known going into .  None of that gets into the trust issues poor use of resources like what states to campaign in and messaging.  So even if we look at Best Case it was not a good situation.  Add in the sexism still in this country and it is allowed to be much more overt than the racism and religious bigotry except toward Islam.   Biden Running may have been the best thing for her or may have been the worst thing.  It may have pushed a better campaign out of her.

Its little wonder the extreme right wing is controlling the country while progressives are threatening to hold their breath and pass out.The Democratic party cant stop progressives from shaping it as they see fit.

11622833,0,t1_dgdg4jk,Thats pretty crazy that so many supposedly liberal voters went for Trump despite his campaign rhetoric. If were talking about centrists in terms of campaign rhetoric over policy platform then yeah I think you make some great points. I think we can agree that a big part of Obamas victory can be attributed to his campaign rhetoric of hope and fighting for progressive values which like you said were not articulated as strongly by Clinton despite her seemingly progressive platform. You make a great point about voting laws like NYs as well. gt It depends on the state. New York surprisingly has some of the most regressive voting laws in the country when it comes to allowing people to vote in the primary that they want to. Having to be registered with the party months before the primary takes place most likely lowers turnout amongst younger people who lean liberal but registered Republican to appease parentsgrandparents.So I think the conclusion of our discussion is that its really important to motivate the base by relying on more progressive campaign rhetoric which I dont disagree with. The only caveat to this strategy is still allowing for candidates of certain districts to be flexible with certain parts of their platform if they think its necessary for their district. For example Thompson of KS was widely regarded as a progressive candidate but he still probably wisely tailored his stance on guns to his electorate. That being said needing to tailor to singleissue voters is more of a necessity in super red states and Florida isnt one of them. ,BlueMidterm2018,dgdgjim,3,t5_3hg2j

I dont know about your state but some states have signature requirements to get candidates on Primary ballots.  If I faced a similar dilemma in Indiana I would collect signatures for all candidates that I was comfortable with while working on other races.In the meantime you can work for candidates in any number of other elections State House and Senate Elections will be going on in  Governors race Abrams Barrow Json Carter Sally Yates etc may be entering Numerous other Executive offices will also be elected gt his background isnt really relevant degree in business and a background as a salesmanThat experience may not be great for being a member of congress it is good for campaigning.

11738240,0,t1_dgqicdi,Id say asking people how they would vote generic ballot is probably a better estimate of how they might vote than favorability polling. Republicans won the presidency with  favorable unfavorable Given that yeah its better to be liked and not thought of as out of touch. I think Democrats need new faces in leadership were still seeing articles on a daily basis about Hillary. Thats not doing anything for anyone on the left. In fact in the favorability polling data you linked to the fall off for Dems starts before the election almost precisely lined up with the Comey letter Aside from a local plateau April Nov.  Dems have been near the current  favorability since . That start of that higher plateau corresponds to Trump becoming the presumptive GOP nominee,BlueMidterm2018,dgqk5dr,5,t5_3hg2j

11758961,1,t1_dgstb60,Bernie wouldve beaten Trump. Easily. He was a similar candidate on the other side. Hillary was too establishment which is what Bernie and Trump were against.
