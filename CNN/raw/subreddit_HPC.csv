1361392,0,t1_cimwgkw,The AMD FX is only . Its obviously not a server processor and doesnt have ECC Memory. Since you have tons of money to work with you could go with something like an AMD Opteron  for  for similar specs.Also would a GPU cluster be a good fit for what youre doing instead?Question Are there any benefits in terms of parallelization from switching to a server cpu like Opteron? I know that the Opterons Socket G has  pins whereas the AM only has . Does that aid in concurrency or are  of cores more relevant?,HPC,cimxux2,-2,t5_2qn63

The US Government is funding research into power efficient architectures and programming models but the Chinese and Japanese both have a history of funding powerinefficient architectures in order to make a splash e.g the Earth Simulator and Tianhe ,HPC,cn27uz9,3,t5_2qn63

8649397,0,t1_d6lq6ld,If you request all the resources in a node in a PBS job then it will give you exclusive access to the whole node and in that scenario everythings fairly simple.If you only request some of the resources in the node then PBS will schedule multiple jobs onto the node and then things get a bit more complicated.PBS itself cannot completely control what hardware an application uses thats up to the operating system. It can set some environment variables and ulimits to guide the application and the PBS MoM server can monitor usage and if you configure it to kill applications which it detects are using too much CPU or memory but it cant fully restrict what an application does.To get the kind of resource isolation that youre talking about then you need to integrate PBS with something like cgroups in the operating system. Its not set up for that outofthebox and so there would need to have been some integration work done to have enabled that.,HPC,d6mscbw,2,t5_2qn63
10579327,0,t1_dd6vtg7,Too many unknowns here to validate what you say. Just because you successfully use a different node does not mean its not the job. How about a cache being in a bad state for instance? This will stick to a node until you run a different workload that reinitializes its cache.,HPC,dd76blz,1,t5_2qn63
10581270,0,t3_5rd7jg,gt If I reboot the slow node and restart fast again!You should look at all of the data sar provides for any cluesAs others have said without knowing a lot about what youre running and at what point in the code things slow down its really difficult to point to a specific issue.If you have performance profiler such as VTune that would help as well.gt No IO blocking. I do a lot with parallel file systems and I would be careful with this claim. Out of anything parallel file systems especially if they are shared with other users jobs systems often can have the least predictable or varying performance. ,HPC,dd7dk20,3,t5_2qn63
