3015473,0,t3_2upj3o,OK so what Im getting from this thread Geeks amp Sports was hitting on Ashley via FB. When he got caught he decided to get defensive instead of apologetic and cut all ties to the Tommy Nation. Now money is apparently involved but thats another part of the story thats getting lost in translation. Seems like another big misunderstanding and the lack of communication is making it look worse than it is. However Im not involved so I cant speak on behalf of all of this. ,tommync2010,coajvx5,2,t5_35lsc

3911886,0,t3_357pm2,So since the Tosh. episode I believe he gained a grand total of  subscribers? Which is OK I guess. I believe he was suspecting A LOT more considering his previous YT videos talking about I know I will be getting a whole bunch of interview requests after this airs and I will have to ask everyone be patient to get their place for an interview. Personally I believe Tommy is quite disappointed over his failed expectations. ,tommync2010,cr26vd1,2,t5_35lsc
4096518,0,t1_crn6za4,Glad to see at least you and Eddie give this place a chance.  Its been great to be able to ask ?s on here as YT filters out so much.Ill watch your hangout video tonight it was nice to read that you tried to engage NLO to clear up the issues.Do you have an idea about Tommys dad threatening them?  They seem to cite it a lot but not back up one thing about it.,tommync2010,crn88n4,4,t5_35lsc

5181073,0,t3_3lkon3,So I ended up watching this well mostly listening the past few days  and to my amazement it was actually a great episode. Way better than when he has guests IMO the banter back amp forth between TommyHamza and TommyRazmuss was fantastic. Reminded me of the good ol days. Hilarious when a few of you guys tried to ask him why he made that one episode private and he wouldnt answer.,tommync2010,cvaic5c,5,t5_35lsc

6277768,0,t3_41hs9f,Probably the safest way to do it would be to have a live show play the videos on there and dont post the video afterwards. Or you could always go the sellout way and offer it as a reward on Patreon. Pretty sure Juggalos only dispensible income is spent on weed facepaint and Tommys child support payents. So not a real chance hed be able to leak it if he actually is the rat.EDIT Or just figure out when the Jugster works does he work? and live stream it then.EDIT  Nevermind just realized Jugster probably lives on welfare. So the best time to stream would be the next Juggalo convention.,tommync2010,cz37mg8,3,t5_35lsc

7141913,0,t1_d1pxv8o,Youre probably right. Im sure he would get some new subscribers out of it. It just sounds like an idea for up and coming youtubers and tommy is sort of passed that point now. Promotion is good but if I were in tommys shoes Id focus on making really kick ass content on youtube. Tommy doesnt need my advice though hes already done more on youtube than Ill ever do lol.,tommync2010,d1pyjp4,1,t5_35lsc
