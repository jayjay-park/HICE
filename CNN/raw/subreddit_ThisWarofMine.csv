2489900,0,t3_2o1p6t,I like not knowing as well... an exampleminor gameplay spoiler was when I needed a weapon and decided to make an axe. It was awesome learning that I could chop useless furniture down from the house for some good resources.,ThisWarofMine,cmjkgt8,3,t5_30xea

2534366,0,t3_2oon5v,Whenever I kill in the game I get so anxious I can feel the blood in my ears pounding in my head. Last time I was worried about what would happen in a game I was  and playing doom  Its such a great game ,ThisWarofMine,cmpdmbw,2,t5_30xea

2568674,0,t3_2p3vvf,also dont forget this is a batering system there is no fixed prices. it depends on what people value each item. so itll be different for each person. youll have to get to know them and know what they want. and how they value each item ,ThisWarofMine,cmtv3vd,1,t5_30xea
2603145,0,t1_cmxbm7j,Yea it says youre going to the home of an older couple and their adult son.  When you get there theres a man with a gun who will attack you but if you kill him the old parents run down and cry over his body.  When you fight the soldier in the supermarket he can surrender apparently but Ive never seen it myself.  I usually only fight if I can coup de grace people.,ThisWarofMine,cmydab3,0,t5_30xea

6708199,0,t1_d0c47dj,I agree about the Brothel bandits but the Hotel can also spawn as a trading location with peaceful thugs. They didnt do anything nasty and seem to be survivalists just like the team.Sometimes it spawns a solitary mentally ill veteran whose equipment you can find buried at the backyard.,ThisWarofMine,d0d6oeo,1,t5_30xea
