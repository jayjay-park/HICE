556709,0,t3_207gjm,There is no acknowledgement from the airlines that radiation is an issue at all.  Its never been mentioned in my  year career.  I dont know about radiation sickness but cancer is prevalent in all forms for flight crews.,flightattendants,cg3jyqn,1,t5_2vb78
2355953,0,t1_cm2vqbf,Thank you for your response. I really feel like I didnt ask enough questions and my oneonone interview went really quick. In case I breeze through do you have any suggestions on what I should ask? I asked a very brief question that the FA really didnt want to answer and she walked around the question...,flightattendants,cm2wnnv,1,t5_2vb78
2426346,0,t1_cmbljnx,I will try to find the guide I had and send it to you. If not you should be able to find a boat load of information on cabincrew.com in the Middle Eastern forum. You will need two sets of photos in a dress suit and casual photos. Also there is a facebook group called Emirates Airlines interviewshopefuls that has dozens of pictures posted. I would send you the link but I have since left the group,flightattendants,cmblqot,2,t5_2vb78

4864426,0,t3_3hem4o,I really didnt have a chance to read through the comments and Im on mobile but I can gaurantee you do not need to list ALL jobs held in the past ten yrs. Especially if you are young and held brief PT positions. An FAA ten year background consists of Where have you been? Ie. Can you andor anyone else account for your whereabouts for the last ten years employers parents roommates teachers. This is to ensure you havent been traveling to certain countries that you may have been compromised by extremism in any way. Secondly they need to know your criminal history. Everything if you have any at all. And lastly a check is ran to ensure you have not previously worked in an FAA regulated safety sensitive position and violated an FAA regulation. You do not need to list the time you work at generic store for  weeks before you quit because it sucked. Source Aviation involved lifestyle and current FA. ,flightattendants,cu7p53u,1,t5_2vb78
6796146,0,t1_d0mgpam,Thank you. I doubt theyll run away yet. They just got the job. But if this does not workout I want an avenue to take to ensure they cannot take off with them.,flightattendants,d0mmty4,1,t5_2vb78
8600820,0,t3_4xl9j9,Yeah you have to have a dog and also you have to pay someone to take care of your dog when youre away. So its not cheap you get to pay for the care of an animal you hardly get to see.,flightattendants,d6gp288,2,t5_2vb78
8913466,0,t3_50djh7,If you really want to be a FA make a list of airlines you want to work for check the careers section on their site regularly and keep applying until someone hires you. Mine your friends and family to see if they have any connections to a currently employed airline person...employee recommendations go a long way.,flightattendants,d7j9ntw,2,t5_2vb78

9161589,0,t3_55rx9j,Depends on the company.  In my experience they were super tightlipped about it all the way up to the day of base assignment.  Going back to even interview process the people conducting the interviews said the likelihood of people getting based in X is really REALLY unlikely.  Four people got based at base X out of .Good news is its not that difficult to transfer bases once you get placed at a base you dont want assuming your company doesnt have a minimummaximum time you have to spend at a given domicile.  But those months that youre not....man oh man....it can be a little rough if you dont have a plan in place.,flightattendants,d8dargc,2,t5_2vb78
