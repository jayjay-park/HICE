8109031,0,t1_d4r67kl,I second this  worked my way through HackingWithSwift last summer and Ive now started on the Algorithms unit on HackerRank. Its a great way to gain practical and working knowledge of code and encourages you to approach programming from a problem solving approach which is something I personally needed to work on.Its also where some companies will host coding tests as part of their employment process something I very recently learnt! so its a good platform to get familiar with.,hackingwithswift,d4rj0mo,2,t5_37qm3
10036932,0,t3_5jfmdi,Id say that there is value in doing the games if only because it gives you additional experience creating something. You are repeating things you already know so hopefully you dont need to continue referencing the basics you learned in earlier chapters. Especially as you get to the later chapters and start learning more about using background resources and everything else. Practice makes perfect as they say!,hackingwithswift,dbfu7av,2,t5_37qm3
