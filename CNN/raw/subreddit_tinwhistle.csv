6752909,0,t3_478gix,It shouldnt be a problem. The highland bagpipes do this a lot to make up for limited range by either tweaking the melody or jumping updown usually up the octave. The standard Lark in the Morning arrangements for highland pipes and tin whistles is a good example. As long as people can still tell what tune it is you should be fine. I would just err on the side of switching octaves in case you end up with funky chords from the different melodies. ,tinwhistle,d0ht3iu,1,t5_2s72k
