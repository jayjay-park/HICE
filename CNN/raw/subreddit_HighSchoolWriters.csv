6316661,0,t3_424xdy,We used to have that in our school but then after the students who were in that club graduated the rest werent motivated nor passionate enough to restart it and to be honest Im not either. Especially considering this is my last year I simply dont have the time to add more responsibilities to my already rather long list of one  Ill be sure to try and start one during college though! If the college Im heading into doesnt already have one that is!  ,HighSchoolWriters,cz7mu5y,1,t5_2tszy

6858459,0,t3_49fbnq,Really interesting concept that I would LOVE to be taken farther and continued with. The only problem I see this far is the word choice some jerk. Burner. To me seems really clunky and out of place. The character so far seems like an interesting one too. A lightly burned man who doesnt intend to kill at all while still remaining a passionate little arsonist would adore to see his motivation continued. Awesome work so far!,HighSchoolWriters,d0tprcx,1,t5_2tszy
