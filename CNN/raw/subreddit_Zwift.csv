6791074,0,t1_d0m1s4k,From what Ive read it generally takes a long downhill section an appropriate boost and a really hard sprint.,Zwift,d0m2230,1,t5_33t8j

9548579,0,t3_5blf2v,Zwift has this thing going on where they happily let other sitespeople do core program stuff so that they can focus on other stuff. Race programming race results forums segments all done by rd parties.    From the Min interview it seems like the reasons are that they are happy with the job other people are doing feel too stretched at the moment and are very focused on breaking through in the mainstream fitness market and making it big. I wouldnt expect an API anytime soon.,Zwift,d9q25k2,1,t5_33t8j
9719078,0,t3_5e8ehc,Its important that you follow the name conventions for Zwift racesYour Name  TEAM TAG  RACE TAG    category  For example J.Walker IGS CIGS  Iron Goat Series crazy people climbing PretzelIn www.zwiftpower.com you can follow the daily races and watch the results. Create a Strava profile and link it to Zwift.Register in Zwiftpower.com and link your Strava profile. Fill the Zwiftpower data with your FTP and so on. After every zwift session with a race close zwift and save in the name the race tag for Strava profile most of races already include race tag on Strava activity but not all of them. This is used if the Zwiftpower data gathering fails and have to leech data from Strava. Be careful... the everyday competition is highly addicting.,Zwift,dab35q5,1,t5_33t8j
9882603,0,t3_5gmi5l,At the very least there should definitely be an indicator of the direction you need to head if you want to stay on the segment.,Zwift,davq671,1,t5_33t8j
10012425,0,t3_5iukv2,This is real but in the reverse order. My first crash in the real world  was in early last year after putting on  miles in zwift.  I was used to not holding onto my handle bars tightly and took a tumble after hitting a small bump in the road. Whoops. ,Zwift,dbcnbt0,3,t5_33t8j

11383432,0,t1_df9bquc,Interesting. I put a new gp on when I started Zwift and have done kms on Zwift since then and it still looks fine. So according to your theory I could do kms irl on one tyre? Cool.,Zwift,dfmajql,0,t5_33t8j
