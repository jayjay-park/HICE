11432888,0,t3_632743,I realy like the game how it is now the only thing i would like to have is some sort of starting stuff something like one campfirein case you spawn in the night and something to eat like  berries,starveio,dfrwms5,1,t5_3jlau
11437346,0,t3_6397rk,Its definitely possible but youll have to rely on a bit of luck. You wont be able to make fire AND gather enough berries all by yourself if you spawn at night. The only real play you can make is to take a place at someone elses fire and hope to god they wont kill you. This is compounded by the fact that you need food so they might get pissed when you take all their berries and just decide to fuck you up. Youll learn this through experience OP and even good players will struggle at night depending on the circumstances. The learning curve for this game is around  hours. After that youll be fine.Regardless the best thing to do if you spawn at night is to just wait until morning and then rejoin the server. No one likes starting at night and youll definitely be starving and maybe even cold by the time morning comes already putting you at a disadvantage.,starveio,dfseuj1,1,t5_3jlau
11507230,0,t3_648wab,Totally agree with the wolves.... Second time I got killed with a diamond base full health and equipment after an  hour session. Before attacking slowed down I could kill wolves with my wood pick. But now they are just insane. While spiders are a joke. You can fight  spiders without even moving.,starveio,dg0cgdq,1,t5_3jlau

11691136,0,t1_dgk1mxo,The other solution is just to give more reason for people to kill others in gameplay making fighting justifiable and not just something to raise your score.,starveio,dgl7ie8,1,t5_3jlau
11696879,0,t1_dgluws9,And instead of just keeping them how about this?GravestoneThe Gravestone makes it so a players items and placeables stay in the game even after the player logs out or dies. So instead of all your bushes and walls disappearing upon death they remain until the gravestone despawns after five minutes or until another player including yourself mines the gravestone to either claim the placed items or destroy them. Destroying and claiming gravestone each take  hits regardless of the tool tier.Using a sword on a grave stone will destroy it and all the items inside it.Using a pickaxe will claim all the placed items fire pits walls doors bushes work benches of the player who the gravestone belonged to. So if you kill someone then claim their grave stone then their fire would stay spawned. This is mainly meant for claiming doors and walls to completely steal a base or just wanting your teammates crop to stay spawned instead of disappearing with them when they dieThis makes it much more interesting for base raiding because now you can steal their whole base. Or you can kill that pesky player who thinks just because he put a fire down he gets your berries no fuck off. Ill take your fire tho.The gravestone also acts as a one way chest that leaves your items in it until taken out. You can pull stuff out of a gravestone but you cant put stuff inBesides that it acts as a chest in the way that you press the  buttons to take resources when a certain distance to it. If there are still resources in the gravestone when you claim or destroy it then those items will disappear.,starveio,dgluyiv,2,t5_3jlau
11713428,0,t3_65unl6,Inspired from the many ideas of a tower to increase the view field I came with this ideaA defense tower wall that act like a wall but you can climb on it on one side so you can hit nearby enemies from the wall without damaging the wall and the enemies only hit the wall when attacking until the wall is destroy.Like this for once it will give an advantage to the owner of a base to defend it because for now you have to go out of your base to defend it or wait until the enemies destroy your wall and get in.It can have a design like most of tower drawing already post like this And have a different version for wooden stone gold and diamond wall.,starveio,dgnqvr0,11,t5_3jlau

11802072,0,t3_65unl6,More caloric power faster heating up for big campfire and bigger radius. As it is now its got no practical use. So three disc zones instead of two closest one being higher heat nd and rd normal heat.It would become important when going into winter biome gt faster heating up and more area to kite the mobs which are already kind of difficult. One lag spike and youre dead instantly.Also at the moment so much time is wasted heating up in winter biome until you get final tier clothing that it just becomes boring. I get it you need to be prepared for winter and its supposed to be tough so woodstonefires as stockpile are important but just sitting like an idiot throughout the night cause you cant move cause youre still farming for rd tier and youd die instantly is not entertaining or reasonable at all. Its just time drain.,starveio,dgxt0no,1,t5_3jlau
11802292,0,t3_65unl6,The problem of starve.ioThis shouldn be an io game. This should be an online game with saving you progress bigger map more servers more and more players are going to play and more. Kinda like rust but in a smaller game.
