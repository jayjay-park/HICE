1664253,0,t3_2d6ebm,Im going to answer some questions people have been asking me.One. Why do you care so much about the Torsploit?When I first heard of the attack I was rather shocked and immediately seen many problems with the operation. First their deployment of the code to legal hidden services made me wonder if they were planning setups not exactly a stretch for the FBI. Than I realized how easy it would be for innocent people to get caught up in the sting or at least people who really werent their intended target. I.E like a  year old going on a click fest through the hidden wiki. Then there was just the legal issues regarding the exploit. Like whether it was done under the authority of a warrant which Ive now confirmed and now whether the warrant was legal.Two. What should I do if I accidentally visited an illegal site with the exploit on it?The exploit could differentiate between accidental and intentional visits that doesnt mean the FBI would actually give a shit so if it  was truly accidental you would at least have a defense.Youre still better off keeping your mouth shut if the FBI does happen to pay you a visit. Destroying evidence is a crime in its self so you would have to make that decision completely on your own.Three. Do you think there will be more arrests?Honestly no they really cant expect to find evidence a year later. Their exploit was no secret. They also have the whole notification requirement to worry about. They cant say that they didnt intend violate the  day rule of the warrant because they have already ran into this issue during Operation Torpedo one of the defendants filed their motion to suppress in August of last year so they had close to a year to notify people of the FH search.This isnt a question more so advice. If you intentionally visit CP sites stop and get yourself some psychological help. If you get caught youre not just ruining your life youre ruining your families to. CP is by far the most horrific crime in public opinion when a pedophile is arrested no one on earth  mitigates your offense. Youre considered the worst scum on the planet regardless of the circumstances and before youre even convicted.If youre into this stuff you have something mentally wrong with you and you need to do something to control yourself.

2007501,0,t3_2hpip5,gt I have an old laptop that I do not use anymore which I would install the best OS for the Relay node. Would the Tails OS be a good platform to run or would I be better with a normal installation of Linux?Tails doesnt really seem necessary.  Every time you reboot youll lose your config and your identity file fingerprint  which means youll have to restart your relay from scratch.Debian is probably the simplest option for you.  Do not use Ubuntu.  Do not use Ubuntu.If youre interested in an amnesiac livesystem use something like TorRamdisk  The single advantage to this system is that should the authorities investigate illegal activity from your relay using this system leaves no doubt that your node was a dumb relay routing other peoples traffic  especially if you entirely disconnect any permanent storage from the device.gtShould I try to setup a DMZ port on my router to have the computer connect to the internet but not interact with the rest of my network? Would VLANs be a better option to isolate the machine?I admire your enthusiasm in keeping the server safe but I dont really think this step is necessary.gt In terms of limiting the amount of bandwidth that the relay would use the basic package from Teksavvy has gb download with unlimited upload with unmetered download between the hours of  and . Would there be a way to capitalize on the unlimited download period as well as setting aside gb  month download limit? You wont capitalize on your mbit down.  Ever.  Think about it  Your relay receives data downloads and pushes it immediately back out uploads.  Since your upload is mbit your download is going to hit a bottleneck of mbit too.To answer the bandwidth limitation question theres a torrc option to limit your bandwidth consumption.gt In the FAQ I see that one of the entries is Why can I not browse anymore after limiting bandwidth on my Tor relay?. If I use a dedicated machine to run the relay and my normal machine as my client I would not need to worry about this correct?Incorrect.  Tor hibernates until the next account period and wont push out any more data.  Nothing stops you running two instances of Tor though one relay with a bandwidth limit the other for your own usage with no or a different limit.gt Teksavvy was listed under the good section section for running an relay in the GoodBadISPs wiki. Does anyone have experience running an exit node on Teksavvy? Should I be worried running one in the future?Its probably against the terms of service to run an exit relay from your domestic connection.  Mixing Tor exit traffic with your own traffic is a very bad idea.  If challenged how do you prove whether illegal traffic came from you or Tor?gt How crazy should I go following the OperationalSecurity doc from torproject? Assess your threat model and act accordingly.gt Is there anything else that I should consider before or during setting up a relay?In general running an exit node from your home connection isnt a great idea for the reasons I specified earlier.  If someone does something illegal LE is more likely to raid your house and march you out in handcuffs before assessing the origin of the traffic.Running a nonexit relay still means your IP will be publicly associated with Tor.  A handful of websites block every IP address associated with Tor.  Others might inconvenience you with moredifficult capchas to prove youre human.

5039205,0,t3_3jyi5s,Please do not use AdaFruits Onion Pi instructions for anything see If you actually need to have all the traffic on your local network Torified though you probably dont I would recommend instead setting up a computer could possibly be an RPi or something else as a Whonix Gateway  see It would probably work although with some caveats. Tor is slow and using it for bandwidthheavy activities puts an undue and unfair strain on the network. It would be essential to never use it for BitTorrent for instance and BitTorrent over Tor isnt anonymous anyway.. Its easy for a website or service to tell that youre using Tor and many of them deliberately block or otherwise impede such access. You may be targeted for sophisticated attacks from nationstates with the goal of deanonymizing you. Some of these attacks may include Advanced Persistent Threats such as highlevel malware infection on your devices. You can reduce this risk by using only Tor Browser and setting its Security Slider to High but that is not a guarantee of protection and it severely limits or completely disrupts the function of many websites including Reddit for instance.I would have two strong suggestions to try before going the route of attempting to send all of your traffic over Tor. You could use two routers in a cascade creating two separate subnets for your activities such as ... and .... This may not solve the issue so I would recommend borrowing a second router to test with before investing in any new equipment. It would also require some advanced networking knowledge to configure properly.. Rather than using a gateway computer that sends all traffic over Tor I would recommend using a gateway computer that sends all traffic over a paid VPN service. This will not suffer from any of the issues that I mentioned above. This would also require some specialized networking knowledge but Im sure you could find good help online.However its worth mentioning that Im somewhat skeptical of your diagnosis. I am not familiar with any network configuration or tools on your dormitorys end that could cause the behavior youre describing and although it could theoretically be possible it would be somewhat difficult and prone to many false positives and false negatives. I would instead consider that the router or devices youre using have a bug or are misconfigured in some way that is causing this problem. One potential cause is that both devices are configured to use the same local IP Address on the network such as ... just as an example. I would make sure that all devices youre installing are configured to use DHCP to Automatically get their IP Address and not configured to use a Static IP Address and furthermore I would recommend seeing if there are any softwarefirmware updates available for the router youre using installing them and then potentially doing a factory reset on the router.

6772577,0,t3_48j2jx,Heres the whole article. Sorry if this breaks rules Im still kinda new to reddit. When is a reasonable expectation of privacy unreasonable? When the government says it is.In this month alone weve had two federal judges and the DOJ state that theres no expectation of privacy in IP addresses. This would normally be something covered by the Third Party Doctrine  where an IP address is part of the records retained by ISPs and therefore can be accessed with subpoenas rather than warrants.The twist though is that all of these statements were made in reference to people who made an active effort to obscure their IP addresses by using Tor.On February st the judge presiding over the Jay Michaud case  the one where the FBI for the second time in recent history ran a child porn website for two weeks in order to gather evidence on visitors to the site  stated that Tor users had no reasonable expectation of privacy despite their privacyprotecting efforts. Michaud was challenging the FBIs use of a standard warrant to deploy its NIT Network Investigative Technique  a piece of malware that gathered information about computers connecting to the child porn website.    US district judge Robert J. Bryan denied the motion noting that while the warrant technically violated the rule a higher courts interpretation provides an exception for when the information sought could have been discovered by other lawful means.    To prove this the judge bizarrely argued that Tor doesnt give its users complete anonymity because a user has to give their IP address to their Internet Service Provider to connect to the Tor network. Therefore he concluded Michauds IP address was public information like an unlisted telephone number that eventually could have been discovered.In doing this the judge agreed with the assertions the DOJ made in its earlier motion. The DOJ claimed Michauds IP address was something he shared with third parties  despite his use of Tor  and was info the government would have eventually discovered one way or another even without the use of its controversial hacking tool.    Even if a defendant wants to seek to hide his Internet Protocol address through the use of Tor that does not cloak the IP address with an expectation of privacy the government wrote in a statement very similar to the opinion later written by Judge Bryan. While Michaud may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in stored information contained on his computer he lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in IP address information that belongs to an internet service provider and that is voluntarily shared with others in the course of Internet communications.The interesting thing about this assertion is that Michaud voluntarily shared his IP address with others. It would seem fairly obvious there was nothing voluntary about this exposure. While its true that IP addresses are shared with Tor when connecting that information is stripped from communications as they travel through the Tor network.The government argued the NIT merely rerouted this information to the FBI before Tor stripped it. Michaud apparently should have known his use of a privacyprotecting network would perhaps expose his IP address to others including the FBI.But as Tor itself states without intervention from other parties this information would not be collected by Tor nor passed along its network.    It is clear that the court does not understand how the Tor network works. The entire purpose of the network is to enable users to communicate privately and securely. While it is true that users disclose information including their IP addresses to unknown individuals running Tor nodes that information gets stripped from messages as they pass through Tors private network pathways.This statement is in response to another judges declaration that people who utilize additional privacy protections when browsing the web still have no expectation of privacy in their IP addresses. This nearlyidentical assertion was made by the judge presiding over the Silk Road . prosecution of Brian Farrell. In this case the Defense Department home of the NSA! paid Carnegie Mellon researchers to attack the Tor network in order to expose identifying info about its users. The FBI followed along behind the DoD firing off subpoenas to obtain this newlydiscovered information.The judge in this case wrote    From the record it appears the only information passed on to law enforcement about the defendant was his IP address. There is nothing presented by the defense other than rank speculation that anything more was obtained by SEI and provided to law enforcement to identify the defendant.    The Court agrees with the government that applicable Ninth Circuit authority precludes the defendants success on his motion. SEIs identification of the defendants IP address because of his use of the Tor network did not constitute a search subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. The Court reaches this conclusion primarily upon reliance on United States v. Forrester  F.d  th Cir. . In Forrester the court clearly enunciated that Internet users have no expectation of privacy in the IP address of the websites they visit because they should know that this information is provided to and used by Internet service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of information.The court goes on to say its too bad Tor users expected more protection from the service but their expectations are not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.    In the instant case it is the Courts understanding that in order for a prospective user to use the Tor network they must disclose information including their IP addresses to unknown individuals running Tor nodes so that their communications can be directed toward their destinations. Under such a system an individual would necessarily be disclosing his identifying information to complete strangers. Again according to the parties submissions such a submission is made despite the understanding communicated by the Tor Project that the Tor network has vulnerabilities and that users might not remain anonymous. Under these circumstances Tor users clearly lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in their IP addresses while using the Tor network. In other words they are taking a significant gamble on any real expectation of privacy under these circumstances.A subjective expectation of privacy is in no way comparable to the historic view of the objective reasonable expectation of privacy. Tor users may be taking extra steps to obscure their IP addresses but two court rulings clearly state the judicial system wont be granting them any extra protection from government subpoenas. In fact these rulings simply make it easier for the government to defend the intrusive techniques it deploys to unmask Tor users by declaring that underneath it all its all about IP addresses rather than users taking proactive steps to better protect their privacy. Its not quite a blank check for hacking but its close. As long as the target is information not historically awarded Fourth Amendment protections courts will be hardpressed to question the means used to achieve these ends. ,TOR,d0jycba,3,t5_2r36m

6871868,0,t1_d0v7eb4,I find that extremely unlikely but I can see where you wouldve drawn that conclusion based on the incomplete information about my servers setup that I gave in the OP. Heres why I dont think the random scan theory is plausibleThe server was transproxied and didnt allow any nonTor traffic in or out. That isnt to say that all traffic had to be going to or from a hidden service just that all traffic had to be going through the Tor network before entering or leaving my box. This means that when the attacker tried to access the Rotten Onion through its real IP address they had to connect through Tor which makes me think it wasnt just a random scan of a massive list of potential targets. Scanning big IP ranges through Tor would make an already long process even longer.Also when they found the true IP address they were able to access it via its IP address and not go through the hidden service. The process doing the maninthemiddleing wasnt bound to localhost a mistake which I have now fixed so they needed to either know the onion address or the IP  the port the attack was running on. Also as I previously mentioned the attacks were accessible through the clearnet but when accessed through the clearnet they were on nonstandard ports for web access ports  which lends more credibility to the idea that they werent just randomly scanning.However the thing that confuses me about all of this the most was that they didnt appear to find all of the MITM processes. Im currently locked out of my VPS for reasons I may or may not expand on in the future but if I remember correctly they only accessed the attacks running on ports .,TOR,d0v8ksw,3,t5_2r36m

This could very easily make you more vulnerable than not using Tor at all!Tails The Amnesic Incognito Live System is an official Tor Project and generally considered to offer great security and privacy while remaing usable for people who are not too technical. You run it from a usb stick SD card or DVD and it gives you a hardened debian linux environment that routes all traffic through Tor.The process to make a Tails drive is a bit more involved than creating just any bootable linux usb but there are very rich and detailed guides on the homepage.Read up a bit on Tails before you dive in so you know what it does and dont hesitate to ask the friendly people on rtails if questions arise. enjoy ,TOR,d7cmmgb,1,t5_2r36m

Would you recommend either over the other?Tails uses firewall rules to make sure all traffic is routed through Tor. Whonix uses virtualization to make sure that the Whonix gateway where the Tor process is located is isolated from the Whonix workstation and that all the traffic goes through the gateway.
