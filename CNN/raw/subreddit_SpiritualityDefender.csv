9415379,0,t1_d99gmex,Buy in strategyYou can take a double rebuy to start... or you can try to navigate on one rebuy and take the add on.  You always take the add on thats a given. I think there are merits to both a late reg one bullet  add on OR taking a double rebuy and playing the full rebuy period.  I alternate between the two and different pros seem to use different approaches. ,SpiritualityDefender,d99gqwc,1,t5_3gv47
10014784,0,t3_5j2j57,I think Im assigning to much value to winning or losing each session when it should never be about that.  Its not that I need to win or an ego please because I won a lot the past week more then I could have ever hoped for.  So whats the problem here?Why do I practically rage out and totally lose it in typical the worst version of myself total anger  I lost control emotionally the first hour of a  hour session because Im pretty much done in the k during the dumb ass reg period which lasts like  more hours...I think Im assigning way to much meaning now to every session because the rest of my life is completely out of balance so its hard to even enjoy playing showing up the th day straight.  Important areas are being beyond neglected like the book  complete a poker project off the tables and dating and social life.  Anyways enough bullshit.  I also think I shoudl consider not regging at the start on most of these majors online.  Not sure why exactly but it could be decent advice.  I see a lot of the top pros do this is well.  ,SpiritualityDefender,dbcye4k,1,t5_3gv47
