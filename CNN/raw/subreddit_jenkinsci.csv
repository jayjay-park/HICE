3943252,0,t3_33urk0,no experience with the RPMs plugin unfortunately.  I just wanted to check in and see if you found a solution to share with the community...  Thanks!,jenkinsci,cr5rj0w,1,t5_2srwp

7805319,0,t3_4m3i4a,Its still not as easy as it should be even with the latest version of that plugin.  Weve just gotten better about using trycatch and other error handling methods and populating those reactions with something useful exit  is a pretty simple way to fail a task.,jenkinsci,d3tdoad,1,t5_2srwp
