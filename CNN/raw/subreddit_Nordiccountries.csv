5363929,0,t3_3ohdsn,I seem to remember a joke telling Finland is the only Nordic monarchy from the old days of the presidential system. The old very strong office of the President of the Republic was a compromise between monarchists and republicans. With the office of the President being turned to being mostly ceremonial admitted with a few very important distinctions  some of which are hopefully never needed one option would be abolishing it altogether.And yes there are still modernday monarchists in Finland but I doubt there would be a way to fit even constitutional monarchy in Finland. In the old days when the country was a kingdom for a brief moment there was an attempt to invite a king from abroad because electing one of us was considered to be problematic. These days with available cadet heirs of European royal houses not being exactly a time in a dozen getting a figurehead without ending up in a personal union might be hard.

10948135,0,t3_5wcel0,Im danish so this is mostly from a danish perspective. But the general division is the way the debate on moral issues and immigration has been handled in the two countries. Swedish Media especially with the rise of Sverigedemokraterna has openly practiced some sort of selfcensorship to numb opinions or suppress views that they viewed as too extreme. Danish Media has played a less interfering role  pretty much allowing every opinion to be heard. The idea is that an open debate will help alleviate the tension that is often present in matters like these in turn creating less room for extremist views. This is also why parties from all sides of the political spectrum praise this way of debating  giving room for every view to be heard automatically suppresses much of the extremism that would take place if these views where to become taboo or looked down upon. The criticism to this and  I think  why Swedish media has had a more combatant approach is that this may help normalize the views that are presented by antiimmigrant parties. Which we have somewhat seen in Denmark where antiimmigrant views very much are accepted in the political debate.   ,Nordiccountries,de980w5,26,t5_2thjn
