9610,0,t1_cefilu7,I agree with your first paragraph a lot I echo very similar points to my playgroup if someone complains about a strategy that is very overt in the way it controls options.This game is won when your opponents have no options. Every thing you do affects options. You increase your options and decrease your opponents. People dont like losing when they never had options land destruction hand discard and incredibly fast combo decks. People also dont like it when you moot their options with hexproof and indestructable or when you deny them options they thought they had countermagic.However deciding how to handle that is all about being a mature adult playing a game. Im grateful to have my playgroup.,EDH,cefj2k3,1,t5_2scee

10524,0,t1_cefm2j6,Exactly.  I play Animar toolbox combo and one game I had pieces in hand and on board to draw my deck so I played  other noncombo but heavy creatures to bait counterspells.  Then my third play was Palinchron and someone played a godamn Mindbreak Trap...I shook his hand cause that couldnt have been any better placement.

28350,0,t3_1ufvu2,Relatively experienced French v player here.Are you expecting tiertuned decks showing up? This deck wont do well against good v decks. Its slow and full of really suboptimal cards terrible lands and missing all the things youd want in a Derevi deck. Your infinite guys combo is cute but very easily disrupted. It also wont happen often given how few ways of finding it you have. You at least want Green Suns Zenith Wordly Tutor and Survival of the Fittest to even think about relying on a creature combo when facing decks full of creature removal. I dont think combo is very viable in French without black Ive seen a weird Enchantress Marath deck but lets not talk about that. Your infinite mana combo is also neat but I dont see it getting you anywhere. Your deck cant reliably do anything with infinite mana. Every so often itll have Blue Suns Zenith but it doesnt have so much as Mystical Tutor to get that. Not to mention the tempo loss from casting a Gilded Lotus will probably lose you the game anyway.Speaking of which you need more creature removal and countermagic. At least Swords to Plowshares and probably Oust are mustruns along with at least Counterspell Spell Pierce etc. v is a fast format. Derevi has access to Edric which you should play.Anyway I could say more things but it looks like you need a redesign. I would reconsider this combo strategy. I know it seems like youll be able to Fauna Shaman into Rector into Intruder Alarm or something but in practise thats never going to happen I think.,EDH,cehnroj,4,t5_2scee

45935,0,t3_1ukm9r,There are a few situations to me where proxies are acceptable.  You have the card but only one of them and you have multiple decks. If you can get the physical card and play with then make a nice proxy and run with that in the other decks. You are trying a deck before you actually acquire all the cards or you have cards on order and want to play with the new deck today even though cards will arrive tomorrownext week.I dont normally speak out to people about proxies but I played a game with a guy who was just getting into EDH and he had  all proxy decks a Zur and a Reaper King. Now the Zur deck was fully mana pimped out yes he had a proxied Tabernacle in there. The Reaper King deck again all proxies was an Aluren combo deck with Imperial Recruiter Imperial Seal and Gaeas Cradle. After the game I asked him if he actually had any of those cards or was planning on ever purchasing them. His reply was an immediate no I dont have them and I dont plan on buying them. To that I responded saying that if you are never going to buy those cards then why are you playing things that are so expensive that no one else is playing them. We arent proxying them because we dont have them and dont plan on buying them. Yes we would like to but we have a reasonable understanding that just because we could proxy it it doesnt necessarily make it a more fun environment. I mean that if I had them most of my control decks would REALLY REALLY want a Tabernacle cause FK creatures right? But I dont have one and dont have the income to get one so I build in a way that is fair to the table around me. If everyone was playing Workshops Imperial Seals Chains of Mephistopheles The Abyss and Tabernacle then I may but guess what less than  in  people I play with have those cards much less play with them in their decks. TLDR Proxy what you have in low quantity or will purchase soon. Dont proxy out of you or your play groups price range. If you dont have the card and it is worth more than  you probably are being a douche by proxying it and playing it. ,EDH,cejnsdp,1,t5_2scee

It happens to require half the amount of damage as your starting life total thus in a format like commander  where your starting life total is larger your infect total must be larger as well. It works that way with TwoHeadedDragon although the ratio is lost.I do see your point as one Ive never heard before in order to windeal damage with infect in EDH you need creatures that have an equal power to those youll find in EDH which simply will not happen.

Its a sac outlet it guarantees a creature in grave it has the potential to draw lots of cards and you get to discard throwing more creatures in the grave for Karador plays.Jarads Orders is a good tutor for this deck and Buried Alive is good for filling up the grave.If you like recurring ETBs with Saffi you might want to look into Cauldron Haze and Cauldron of Souls.

Two cards from New Phyrexia are also pretty devious for turning on Rakdos Geths Verdict and Enslave  Finally Bloodgift Demon can serve double duty as a Phyrexian Arena with wings and a Rakdos enabler if you need it in a pinch.

If you are successful you can pull off some amazing plays and the deck never plays the same way twice. Ive had games where Ive had to go voltron because lazav became someone interesting Such as avacyn. Others have been won by playing Rise of the Dark Realms and reanimating  creatures in one shot ETB triggers are always fun.,EDH,cf1fvsq,3,t5_2scee

242822,0,t3_1wvb2m,I have to be honest...I dont mind this at all.Now my perspective is that Im a player who just recently posted my first real EDH deck...which means I took the Bant precon and modified the hell out of it. Now I went with several fun themes in those colors but I also chucked some power cards in because I had them and wanted to play with them but also because theres a guy at my LGS who plays these ridiculous decks...its just not fun to play against him and he doesnt seem to have any concept of fun outside of wreck faces.Thats fine. Thats some peoples thing. Its mine when Im playing formats besides EDH and I can get pretty casual on some draft nights honestly but when Im playing EDH I want everyone to have fun and do big stupid stuff that you cant in other formats.So...seeing as I cracked pretty much every Primordial in foil during Gatecrash I tossed him in there along with my foil Deadeye Navigator. Gotta bling it out right? But everytime I did stuff like that I felt kinda like a jerk because it just wrecks everyone elses game. I kept it in so that itd be available in case I played him super competitive guy but it wouldnt be consistent. I even made Soulsinger my general instead of Roon havent shelled out for a Rafiq yet seeing as Ive caught the foil bug just so that if I DID draw S.Prime Id have to draw either Roon or Deadeye before it could get really nasty.So honestly...yeah my decks power drops a little but the fun quotient for everyone else should increase.,EDH,cf5x5ci,3,t5_2scee

277230,0,t1_cf9bsoz,Obviously its all about personal preference  I agree! But in the interest of debate...gt It keeps life gain in check. Regular card magic doesnt need a way to keep life gain decks in check and neither does edh.I think the two arent comparable. EDH allows you to run just about every card in Magic with few exceptions and it allows you to do so A with twice the life total and B with many different opponents. Life gain as a strategy becomes much much better in this situation since you now have the time and the cards to go infinite or at least functionally infinite.gt First if youre at a table with a life gain deck and no one elses deck is geared for the commander damage kill then its a moot point.Yes and no. While you may not be playing a Voltron deck you still have a commander which means you can still deal commander damage. I have almost been taken out of a game by an Azusa man. Commander damage is never off the table.gt Second infect mill lose the game effects win the game effects infinite combos and of course hating the life gain player out very quickly are all perfectly viable means already built into the game of dealing with a player who plans on gaining a bunch of life why do we need another one?Infect and mill are definitely not mechanics commonly seen in decks. Theyre often specific strategies the deck is built around with the intent of winning that way... just like Voltron. The difference however is that everyone can win with commander damage regardless of the deck unless of course your commander has a power of .gt Oh and Sorin Markov. I actually run a life gain deck and I got wrecked by Sorin once I didnt see that coming.Definitely a silver bullet! But not one that is often played or one that everyone can play.I guess my point is that while there are many other ways to deal with infinite lifegain and all that jazz commander damage is a rule that makes it so that EVERYONE can deal with those kinds of strategies. It allows games to finally blessedly end and not just because everyone throws up their hands and says I cant get through a bajllion life you win by default.,EDH,cf9hx9t,2,t5_2scee

But my Jeleva deck is very affordable. Any  color deck tends to be more because to do it properly you need a decent mana base. But monodecks and some commanders are really affordable I run    rocks depending on what deck it is.  Here is a very useful spreadsheet I made for making a land list. I put the approximate cost when I was building it off of tcgplayer prices Many others in the thread posted helpful information. I enjoy building decks so I build decks frequently and look at others on tcgplayer and I end up finding new staples all the time.

Avacyn Angel of Hope Angelic Arbiter Angel of Jubilation would be a good idea too.

If you have a lot of mana ramp you can reduce your land count. In my Sharuum deck where I tutor out a lot of cards I need draw a bunch and also have the standard Sol Ring and  signets plus Mana Vault I only run  lands and it works.Generally if I can run a ton of draw and rocks plus tutors basically blue and black I like to run  lands.

701251,0,t3_225otx, lands seems too low. Your general will get you more lands but you still have to get to  mana to cast her. I think you could add some more utility lands like Gavony Township OranRief the Vastwood Mosswort Bridge Windbrisk Heights. Obviously Gaeas Cradle would be great but its out of most players price range. Maybe your group would let you use a gold bordered one. Obviously dont cut basic lands because you want lots to keep the engine flowing.Then you can use your abundance of basic lands to find the utility ones. I absolutely recommend Knight of the Reliquary and maybe Crop Rotation. Karametra has a nice cross over between creatures and lands so add more things to take advantage of that.Still I agree with another poster that vanilla beaters with no protection or evasion like Bronzebeak Moa and Steppe Lynx are probably not going to connect to your opponents faces that often. Id recommend more cheap utility creatures to get more land drops out of Karametra.

In EDH you tend to need to deal with a lot of things at once. Dealing with one thing temporarily seems weak. Hehe.

On the extra turn Flashback Increasing Savagery. Repeat  extra turns.Forgotten Ancient racks up  counters like its his job and moves them no problem. In a  player game if each player casts an average of  spells per turn thats an easy  counters moved onto this guy. I can build counters on anyone else and then move them for a single mana with Bioshift. Generating   counters on my other creatures is usually no problem.And those are the likely situations. What happens with a bit of an improved board state? Vorel Gilder Bairn and Doubling Season change the first example from  and  turns to  and  not to mention that it wont be hard to build up another  counters in the extra turns. Prophet of Kruphix  Vorel  this guy? Each other players upkeep I double his counters. With three other players and only one counter on him itll be eight counters by my upkeep. Now what happens in the most ridiculous case? VorelKioras FollowerThousandYear ElixirDoubling SeasonSage out. Smash  counters onto Sage with Increasing SavageryFlashback. Season makes that .

Im guessing you plan to go Voltron with the list so having these equipments will add plenty of value. The protection effects will also make Tromokratis unblockable if even one of their creatures is a color you have protection from. Try to add some flying effects as well. This will usually make Tromokratis unblockable unless all of their creatures have flying. You can do this with some cheap artifacts like Cobbled Wings or Bladed Pinions or with some enchantments like Nimbus Naiad or Spectral Flight. Be sure to add the new Leviathan from JOU the one that bounces creatures based on the number of islands you own as he can be a psuedo Cyclonic Rift which should be in your list on a creature.,EDH,ch0fd8a,1,t5_2scee

863680,0,t3_240fcm,BEFORE looking at your decklistI feel that as a rule Aurelia makes for a better general than Iroas. There are probably exceptions but just dropping Aurelia and getting to declare attackers once gives you more value than having Iroas out ever does unless you are building the deck to work with him instant speed damaging boardwipe during the declare attackers step anyone?Iroas seems like hed be a good fit in an Aurelia deck and I intend to do that with my Aurelia deckAFTER looking at your decklistIroas seems like a better fit as the general for you deck than he would as the general for mine and which is better is at least somewhat dependent on your local meta but Im still inclined to say that Aurelia would typically be better interactions with KikiJiki Hero of Bladehold Brimaz Inferno Titan Sun Titan etc. If nothing else having her in your command zone on turns  and later force opponents to keep mana open if they want to avoid getting bashed in the face.Id say keep testing them and see what seems to work better.As for resiliency against removal most of the best targeted removal which gets run in EDH still hits both counters exile effects and Iroas can get taken out by more good cards like Deglamer and Return to Dust which Aurelia cant.EDIT Also Aurelia is fun and good. Iroas seems to me like hes just good. He doesnt do anything flashy like extra combat phases so at least for me my personal enjoyment of playing Boros would be decreased by switching. Your mileage may vary.EDIT Spelling.,EDH,ch2gf5g,3,t5_2scee

915379,0,t3_24l1rt,There are a few elements. Things that do not allow your opponents to untap. Cards like Stasis Winter Orb Static Orb Rising Waters Hokori Dust Drinker.. Evasive weenies. Play a lot of these. The engine is going to be based on locking the board and generating huge amounts of resources by connecting with creatures. There are a ton to choose from here. I like ones that also have vigilance or doublestrike which basically ends up as vigilance in this deck. Some of them should have utility even if they arent evasive such as Qasali Pridemage.. Cards that give you things when your weenies connect. Most notably card draw. Coastal Piracy Bident of Thasa and Edric Spymaster of Trest. You can also use Archivist and Azami as pseudoboard state curiosity by aiming all your untap triggers at them. Other good things include untapping all your lands with Bear Umbra Sword of Feast and Famine and most importantly Natures Will.. Tutors! Most important tutor might be Birthing Pod as it allows you a great sac outlet for Derevi that gets you huge advantage in the process since she always casts for . Most of the time this will find your Hokori and start up a lock. Other good tutors include Worldly Tutor Wargate Green Suns Zenith Enlightened Tutor Mystical Tutor etc. Tutors will help you find combo and lock pieces easily.. Counterspells and Card Draw. Keep it simple here. I like playing Sphinx Revelation in mine since I run  different cards that untap all my lands mid combat. Lets me pile up huge mana to draw with. The counterspells should be tempo oriented and easy. You are going to establish some REALLY fast locks so we are less concerned with how good our counterspells are and more concerned with how easy it is to advance our plan and leave them up.. Tucks. Cards like Condemn HinderSpell Crumple Bant Charm Oblation Spin Into Myth. At least if you fail to go off quickly you can wreck your opponents plans until you are back online.. Sac outlets. Dont let people tuck Derevi. I mean we are EXCELLENT at tutoring for her but regardless... My favorites are Martyrs Cause Voidmage Prodigy and Seaside Haven. General Derevi Synergy. Thawing Glaciers Bloom Tender Mana Vault etc.. This is the category for Prophet of Kruphix. Yes the table will groan when you play this but let them know it will all be over shortly.. Board wide Vigilance. There are really only  good options. Heliod and Reconnaissance. Recon is ridiculous when you abuse the ability the right way. True Conviction also goes in this category as it pretty much gives vigilance if you spend one of the hits untapping the creature itself.THIS list pretty well encapsulates my image of the deck. I have played this guys list exactly before. I didnt like Arcanis or Tradewind Rider both felt clunky and slow. Lux Cannon is way worse than you would think too. I cut them for Heliod Static Orb and Enlightened Tutor and I felt it worked out much better.As for other options there are some reasonable combos you can play in the deck such as the Mirror Entity Karmic Guide Revelark combo. If paired with even just your Derevi this combo can give you infinite mana and infinitely tap your opponents boards on their upkeeps and all  of the cards are reasonable without the other combo pieces. Same goes for Earthcraft  Squirrel nest. Deadeye Navigator combos are obviously playable in this deck as well.Just as a neat tip even without much of a board state to untap your lands with Static Orb can be super effective with just Derevi and a sac outlet. At the end of the players turn just before yours sac Derevi recast her and tap the Orb down. You get a totally normal untap step and everyone else still gets crappy ones! It is absolutely my favorite Orb effect in the deck for this reason. It amazes me how little it gets played as to me it is FAR more brutal than the other orbs.,EDH,ch8c27l,4,t5_2scee

At first it was a Extra turn designed deck that revolved around free extra turns and abusing those high mana costs. This was deemed unfun by all at the table and shortly I was asked to remove all of my extra turns cards. With those removed I switched to a slow roll Jeleva using control cards to get planeswalkers online including Nicol Bolas for the Win. This was also deemed unfun and I was asked to remove my last win cons in the entire deck including Nicol Bolas. Now here we are the deck lacks serious game finishers especially in multiplayer situations.

Warp World then reveals cards from your library equal to the number of permanents shuffled in and tokens arent cards so they dont get revealed. The tokens remain in the library until the next time statebased actions are checked.No I cant think of a single situation in which this would be relevant but it is a rather interesting bit of information about one of my three favorite cards.Yes in practice it is pointless to actually physically shuffle the tokens in.,EDH,ci0c6vr,1,t5_2scee

1185963,0,t3_27okhg,Heya Ive been playing Marchesa for  or  weeks with a Proxy List with my play group so Ill share some of my findings with cards Blood Artist Been really hit or miss for me so I stopped playing it. Your mileage may vary. Carrion Feeder Has never really been good for me.  Cytoplast Manipulator Ditto. Others say shes great though. Disciple of Bolas Seems great cause it draws and sacrifices when you play it but the life gain hurts. Youll quickly find if you drop this at a good time you cant retrigger Dethrone which overall hurts your game plan.  Draining Welk It has  counters but consider the timing on the revival with Marchesa. It can only counter one thing so youre essentially playing a  mana counterspell. Exava I like her but she just hasnt wowed me so shes currently about to be cut from my list. Grimgrin As I said in another thread really really good when youre winning. Really really bad when youre losing. I stopped playing him for this reason. Play Grave Titan instead. Hes ridiculous with Marchesa You get  zombies every time he dies and no one is going to block him cause of Deathtouch so he just gets huge and makes tons of tokens. Molten Primordial Everyone keeps playing him. He doesnt get his trigger on revival with Marchesa. Hes only really great if you have a Sac outlet as soon as you play him in which case you get  to  creatures. If you play Insurrection you get all the creatures in the same situation. Otherwise the Blue and Black Primordials are better in almost every situation.  Taurean Mauler Vanilla beatstick. You want utility on your creatures honestly.  Cauldron of Souls Seems redundant. Hammer of Purphoros I dont really think you need it. Play Greed instead. Same Mana Cost draws cards keeps life low for Dethrone Triggers. Barter in Blood I dont really think you need it but thats just me.From your Maybe Board Id consider Archaeomancer With a sac outlet you can recur cheap removal or counterspells on demand. Chaos Warp Its ridiculous. Erebos Its an indestructible Greed basically. You want to keep your life total low and hes one of the best ways to do so. Greed  Insurrection If you decide you really want the Molten Primordial combo. Slave of Bolas Permanent Control Magic. ,EDH,ci31fu7,2,t5_2scee

Berit can steal my opponents interesting things and then I have even more interesting things!I dont know though.  I think Im Esper at heart.  Blue has too much utility white has good removal and white weenies is a favored strategy of mine.  Black has good removal too and lots of fun effects.  I think Id have to stick with Esper.  Bant could be good too but green doesnt appeal to me like the others. A chaotic red deck would be fun Norin is probably one of the only red generals Id build around.  Its tough.

1214032,0,t3_27vxxb,While I agree that the color pie should be broken every now and then chaos warp is a great example some of these suggestions just seem... Wishy washy. For one I dont think that white or red should get direct draw or definitely not consistent draw. Maybe something like a read the bones effect and even thats iffy. Second the biggest problem I had was that you forgot to mention the other side of things aka all the effects and stuff that other colors have. For example you mention how there were colorless wrath effects but dont talk about minds eyestaff of ninjayameade tome. So why cant be have a board wipe in green? Black has a bunch of effects and white is a classic and even red has chain reactionblasphemous act. Why cant green get a similar cheap board wipe? Or red get an exile effect? Or blue get an edict effect? There are a lot of different effects and some colors just dont get all of them. Card draw happens to be outside of red and white for the most part but they make up for it with great mass and spot removal. I guess my biggest issue is that you seem to talk about certain effects as being colorless while forgetting that even card drawland ramp has colorless options. ,EDH,ci673ou,1,t5_2scee

1310527,0,t1_ciguyf7,Im going to trail this comment because I completely agree with all of it.  Apologies if this is mostly a repeat but I really want to make sure this point is represented a lot.  We need more monocolor converts!I actually rarely run multicolor decks.  Monocolor allows you to more fully explore the color forces you to be more creative and gives you the potential to use underrated or even bad cards from older sets or with very specific uses.  This not only is a blast for a deck builder but I believe this makes you a much stronger deck builder overall. I fell in love with Purphoros when I got to use Firecat Blitz for example and one of the most creative decks I ever saw and had a blast playing against was a Myojin of Seeing Winds deck. As many have stated also it is very cheap as you need way less staples and mana fixing.  Your staples also easily translate over to multiple decks e.g. you will only need one Nykthos ever.  You can build  relatively competitive monocolor decks for the price of  relatively competitive multicolor deck.Main drawback  Iona sucks even more. ,EDH,cih1u6j,2,t5_2scee

She is a very manaintesive general. Im not quite sure what your plan is for Aggression but it seems weak. Normally Im all for Browbeat and Breaking Point but not in EDH. Three mana for six damage is weak and five damage is worse. You dont want to be sitting on your proactive cards especially in red. What was your plan with Book Burning? They mill six for two and you do what? I also wouldnt recommend expensive land destruction like Demolish Melt Terrain and Seismic Spike. Even Rolling Terrain is iffy.

Temporary steal isnt nearly as bad or target placing though KikiJiki will always bring you hate and combos way too easily so play him at your own risk although he is definitely a good win condition. I would however highly recommend Zealous Conscripts. Its a nice body has a surprising amount of utility and is just an awesome card. If youre trying to win in the end with a combo Id try and go for something a little more subtle or more difficult to do that way you wont create as big of a target and can just sneak in wins.,EDH,cirwarl,1,t5_2scee

I have a Japanese foil from overseas and the deck does my favorite thing answer problems. Kill kill kill.I also currently have Adamaro First to Desire. I like Kamigawa. Adamaro is like Ruhan in that he is a severely undercosted beater but without the drawback and in two fewer colors Monored is way better than having blue haters gonna hate. The deck doesnt have the dedication of Toshiro so I cant run every wheel effect but Ive got Reforge the Soul and Memory Jar and the like to keep the gas going and keep Adamaro in a threestrike range.Wort the Raidmother gives RG a powerful form of card advantage. I pair her with stuff like Wild Guess and Regrowth to generate card advantage where you wouldnt normally. Copy spells now copy twice for four total renditions of a single spell so I run as many as I can. Goblin Game is fun.Tibor and Lumia is a monoblue commander. Dont let anyone fool you. Run it with Trait Doctoring and change red to blue hook up the pair with Charisma or Basilisk Collar and drop a spell to wipe. Theres also plenty of ways to take away flying like Mystic Decree. Drop a Levitation afterwards and let timestamps do the rest. Or just play Archetype of Imagination.Gwendlyn Di Corci run a sweet The Rack deck. Uba Mask has many uses. The Rack itself is not as good since its targeted at a single player but still usable. I prefer to have Quest for the Nihil Stone or Painful Quandry.

1504264,0,t1_cj49ct4,I see. I think we just disagree with play style here.I think that having an aggressively costed commander that is able to deal good damage presents an amount of inevitability Especially with trollshroud... And that is the type of game I want to play. Im not really looking to kill anyone by turn eight... I would chose a different commander with different colours if I was planning on that. I am playing Geist as a late game control and tend to use my removal and wipes to play politics. Things which clear a whole stack such as Mindbreak Trap and Swift Silence have a great role in stopping storm as well as stopping tiffs between opposing players. And since Im playing for the long game cards that replace themselves while doing a thing or otherwise draw cards are invaluable. All my opinion.

1537575,0,t1_cj8u9of,Up to you really I think WW is a cool enough card.. but its not my deck Be careful with mana rocks vs land. The gem especially bounces some of your land so can make you hit more landdrops but puts you behind with them on board. The gem is much more vulnerable to mass destruction too. The scope only helps if there is a good critical mass in your deck and is conditional.For similar reasons I dont think Chromatic Lantern is necessary. Darksteel ingot here is you really want the manarock.Armillary Sphere seems like a better replacement for the equipment here.Themewise Gild is a tough one. I suggested to cut cos its flavour is more make into gold that stealfind gold. Macar himself could go or not for similar reasons.Of the lands themselves I dont think you need buried ruin here. Id also cut Rootwater Depths Saprazzan Cove and Bottomless Vault for basics.

1630237,0,t3_2czezj,I have a few suggestions Abundance is great in landheavy decks because it stops you from getting flooded with lands when you dont want to. You already have Sylvan Library in your deck and Abundance  Sylvan Library is a neat combo that gets you  extra cards per turn without requiring any life payment.  Realms Uncharted is great in land decks its like a Gifts Ungiven for lands. Speaking of which Gifts is banned in EDH so you should probably remove it from your deck.  Ive always been underwhelmed with Darksteel Colossus as a finisher in EDH. Sure its a big indestructible fatty but it doesnt kill people all that fast in a  life format. Id recommend either swapping it out for its brother Blightsteel Colossus which can take people out quicker or better yet just play Bribery to steal someone elses fatty of your choice.,EDH,cjknn1l,7,t5_2scee

Tappedout lists the low price being  and you can get it down lower by cutting Sol Ring Lightning Greaves and the dual lands.The deck wins by hitting  mana while playing draw spells that also let you discard spare enchantments and then playing Bruna and swinging in. Its very much an eggs all in one basket type deck but at the same time your basket has Protection from Creatures Shroud and multiple instances of totem armor not to mention flickerform. And it can win just with a low cost creature being equipped with enchantments that stack up.

1817383,0,t3_2fd3tw,Ive been playing EDH for nearly halfadecade maybe even a bit more then that. And I started off like all newbies to the format Sol Ring Vault Powerstone Dynamo Signets Gilded Lotus ect... just jammin mana rocks. That lasted for the first several years of my EDH experience but one day I thought to myself  there has to be a better more reliable way to not get blownout by a massremoval to not get hosed by things that shut down activated abilities and to actually not have to waste valuable card slots with mostly mana rocks that are mostly useless after turn .So I dont anymore I just run a few more lands  in monocolor decks and  in my threecolor decks. And so far its worked out great. Green decks get actualland ramp and decks with white get Kor Cartographer and the drop guy that ramps a plains. And every deck except for straightupmonogreen gets Burnished Hart and most decks also get Wayfarers Bauble.The result  games are better win ratio is up I dont worry about my mana rocks getting blown up and being stuck with only a few lands. Heck I love getting lands into play so much that Druidic Satchel is a staple in every deck I own but Azusa. as is Burnished Hart.Land Ramp gt RocksLands gt RocksLands gt Dorks I dont run dorks either except for Roffelos in Azusa.Now this can all anecdotal  based off my own word but Im telling the truth  the game is much more fun when youre not spamming mana rocks and hoping to not draw more of them.,EDH,ck86f6c,2,t5_2scee

However if you really like hot wheels cars and hate NASCAR chances are google will not display NASCAR in your results.Google also pools your personalized searches from other sites by using something called Google AdSense.

Usually I either outlast my enemies and kill the last man standing or kill with a slow tsunami of tokens.To keep the oppression at a high level but simultaneously keep the deck fun to play against I only run  tutors. I think its more fun that way as the games never play out the same. ,EDH,ckku7b8,2,t5_2scee

1952765,0,t1_ckoh9dv,Mine is at a university which is one of the reasons we allow proxies. We cant have any house rules because of the way people come and go new faces every year as other leave. If we didnt allow proxies it would probably lead to way more problems than what allowing them brings. Our club is rather large so it is generally easy to find cards you want from trades we have groups that grind PTQs or whatever the new ones are called and GPs and go to local SCG events so people trade quite a bit. We have  drafts a week as well on average.,EDH,ckoifpn,2,t5_2scee
1953748,0,t3_2h1u42,I think if you had a deck of your own youd be less confused. Its much harder playing someone elses. If you went through the process of making the deck you know the little intricacies and what triggers which. Also some decks are just loaded with triggers. You can play a fairly straightforward deck. Monogreen agro is usually a little easier. This goes for your own deck and those of your play group. In terms of making a deck yourself you can start with a precon. New ones are going to be coming out pretty soon. Or just find a legend you think fun or interesting and look up decklists. Also use the gatherer with a few keyword searches. ,EDH,ckomonz,3,t5_2scee

1960558,0,t1_ckoyphc,gt Rule   If you have a card in your deck that you wouldnt ever want to cascade into take it out. Counters especially are terrible in a Maelstrom Wanderer deck imho. With the exception of Cryptic Command and spelljack which is actually really cool cause you can counter Maelstrom Wanderer and then play him again for free and you get to cascade again all other counters are suck.The counters I play in my MW  SpelljackVenser Shaper SavantPlasm Capture Glen Elendra ArchmageAll of those can be cascaded into without fear. Spelljack is god tier Venser is a major temp olss for my opponent or to get MW back in my hand to cast again or cast next turn Plasm Capture lets me cast MW again next turn  a bunch of other stuff and Glen Elendra has a lot of utility and is a  drop to pod into a combo piece Actualy thinking about it because of persist I could pod into Zealous Conscripts untap pod then pod into Kiki off the same creature.... I never mind seeing these in my cascades and whenever I have countered MW it always has benefited me. It also gives me that edge or at least on the same level against other combo decks. More than once an instant speed MW has saved me the game by cascading into a much needed counter. Heres my list I think its pretty good  ,EDH,ckpg6is,2,t5_2scee

1972482,0,t3_2h9vzh,Ya my friends didnt much care for my Brago deck as well. PI can give a few pointers for sure. For instance I found even though I drew the plainsislandsol ring hands it is almost never worth dropping Brago that early as youre not getting a lot of value off bounces. Always try to keep him back until you can protect him or everyone has blown their removals on other boards.The other thing I did to win more often was to hold back on parts of the combo as well. So unless I have Brago ready to attack I usually dont play my Strionic Resonator just yet.Since its hard to be political I recommend going with the control everyones boards. KnightCaptain of Eos is just a really cool creature because he synergizes well with Elspeth and nobody really finds  creatures that threatening in the beginning. But if you lead with those into Opposition you can usually come out winning. Another angle to go towards Opposition is running things like Myr Battlesphere and Genesis Chamber which is nice cause it wins out with Opposition as well and Myr becomes another wincon.I agree with everyone else that its best to just boardwipe the slivers. Ghostway is very sweet for that. In mine I used Gift of Immortality and Cauldron of Souls to keep my board around since theyre more permanent solutions if you dont have the Archeo out yet.But yeah just try to play passively for the most part while giving up a planeswalker here and there along the way. With graveyard recursion its not too hard to get a lot of those permanents back later anyways.,EDH,ckqvuvv,1,t5_2scee

1996665,0,t3_2hjfex,In my local playgroup Pauper EDH is a more competitive format than regular EDH despite the lower power cards and thus it sort of follows that most of the decks are pretty welltuned. To that end if your playgroup will ever evolve devolve? into a competitive meta you absolutely need to have a way to beat Pestilence and Capsize the two big bogeymen of the format. So Id recommend some more maindeck enchantment and artifact hate of which you have the pick of the litter being in GW. Qasali Pridemage Deglamer Devout Witness Sylvok Replica etc. For Capsize Vines of Vastwood seems okay. Presence of Gond and Midnight Guard go infinite which is cool and gives your deck some teeth and both cards are pretty synergistic on their own with Juniper Order Ranger. Thallids seem good as do pretty much any token generators. Good luck!,EDH,cktsr7f,1,t5_2scee

Also  Im already running Maelstrom Pulse.I replaced Acidic Slime with Reclamation Sage a few months back  the issue is there are some really fast decks in my meta Omnath GAAIV that have led me to need a lower curve to keep up.

2059614,0,t3_2idl3w,My Selvala deck has ended up being one of my more competitive weirdly. I also find her to be a complete blast to play.Her ability lets you ramp out huge threats and shes great as a greenwhite goodstuff commander too. She also tends to stick around a bit as players are hoping theyll draw answers to your big threats. A few cards that have overperformed for me  so far the deck is still very much in the prototype stagesExploration and Walking Atlas Youll be drawing into a lot of land. These help get it onto the battlefield. Also theyre perfect flavor.Avenger of Zendikar Genesis Hydra Sigarda Worldspine Wurm All excellent threats to bring online between turns  to . Serra Avatar and Behemoth SledgeLoxodon Warhammer So much life gain.Soul of New Phyrexia Youll want to play a lot of board sweepers Rout and Phyrexian Rebirth are particularly nice. You can reestablish your board presence much quicker than your opponents so keep some threats in hand wait for your opponents to overextend with all their extra cards then wipe. Terminus is amazing if you can hit all your opponents commanders  even if it puts Selvala on the bottom of your library youve still got mana and cards to spare.Chalice of Life This card is amazing and super fun. Youll be able to flip it quickly unless players catch on quick and once flipped your opponents will be on a very quick clock. Bonus points for using it with Seedborn Muse on the field.Empyrial Plate Umbral Mantle Sword of the Paruns Some useful equipment for Selvala. With Empyrial Plate you can often swing for devastating amounts of commander damage provided you can give her evasion. If youve got enough players Umbral Mantle can bolster Selvala and possibly even mill out an opponent. The Sword can also help you mill out an opponent but wont get Selvala in lethal commander range.Thousand Year Elixir The psudohaste is nice for Selvala but the untap is what really sells it.Vedalken Orrey Lets you hold onto Selvala mana until the last moment.Vensers Journal and Well of Lost Dreams Theyre a nice little combo by themselves but either one also compliments Selvalas parlay.Dueling Grounds Youll often want to be attacking with one big threat at a time and this shuts down an opponents token strategy. Its very good but you wont want it on the board when you cast...Storm Herd Make that life do some work for you.Hope that helps!

It runs Primal Surge as its win con which dumps City of Solitude to ensure my opponents cant respond Storm Cauldron so I can float the mana off my  lands and return them all to my hand cast Borb with the floating and equip him with Illusionists Bracers so discarding land does  damage instead of  then throwing my hand at everyone to kill them. Thats the main combo engine and I use Ring of Three Wishes and Planar Portal to ensure I can get the surge. I have Oracle of Mul Daya Exploration and Asuza for multiple land plays so I can get the  required for the ring and surge and Horn of Greed so I can draw off of each drop. Also running Vexing Shusher to add resiliency to the combo.Its actually won  of the games Ive played since putting in Primal Surge which is like  games. Im really happy with it.

Then a couple decks later and some reading I put some exile things in and remove and get around gods. They are still strong but not impossible. If he cant get past  hexproof cards maybe he should rework his deck to not suck. Or group hug that shit and tell him since you cant make a proper deck let me help you out with some card draw ,EDH,clrlfbn,1,t5_2scee

2275195,0,t1_clsqfe3,So let me get this straight....you need...an extra card to effectively do what a  mana angel does  BUT can only get rid of tapped creatures that arent indestructible? Sure it is just a plain ol ETB effect and not one that requries it to be cast. But I think youre just ignorant to the fact that you now need two cards to stop someones combat  and if they have reanimation  youve really done nothing but slow them down.  MANA is trivial and exiling creatures enmass is icing on a cake of awesome. If youre to dumb to jump through a mana hoop honestly  and in my opinion youre to dumb to be playing this format.,EDH,clsxlj4,1,t5_2scee

2523850,0,t3_2ok36o,Welcome to the joys of Animar I rebuilt my Riku deck into Animar not long since as I found I wasnt really getting much use out of Riku and it is definitely a fun deck while remaining strong.This is my current list There is still work to be done which include mana tweaking and adding some of the creatures off of the maybe list but so far Ive found that focusing on the creatures for beats utility ramp and combo is the way to go as they continue to get cheaper and feed Animar so you will be more inclined to play them. The downside to this of course is you are prone to blow out after you splurge your hand. Couple of synergistic or combo plays are KikiJiki Mirror Breaker  Zealous Conscripts is unlimited Zealous Conscripts you could do the same with Pestermite or Deceiver Exarch Tooth and Nail for the above though will get jeered at but is very effective just try not to do it too often. Cloudstone Curio really could get its own section but basically the idea is to keep returning two creatures to your hand which are free or pay for themselves as much as you like to make an Animar of any size you wish while getting benefits these could beThese can be creatures you can use to make infinite mana such asPalinchronPeregrine DrakeCloud of FaeriesA mix of the above mana accelerators and bounce creatures to return more to replay the ETB triggers Dream Stalker ManoWar  Shrieking DrakeOr my favourite two morph creatures being cast for free  I run a few with some extra utility Nantuko Vigilante Artifact  Enchantment destruction Rattleclaw Mystic Mana dork Willbender Send that pesky Chaos Warp  Oblation back at their commanderCard draw Primordial Sage  any creatures being cast Soul of the Harvest  any none token creature entering the battlefieldDamage Purphoros God of the Forge  any creatures entering the battlefield  Who can say no to paying R for  damage to all opponentsBounce Bounce opponents creatures with ManoWar  Palinchron or Peregrine Drake Bounce opponents permanents with Venser Shaper Servant  Palinchron or Peregrine Drake Acidic Slime and Palinchron or Peregrine Drake to blow up all your opponents artifacts enchantments and lands.Cascade Cascade for a CMC nonland permanent with Palinchron or Peregrine Drake and Maelstrom Wanderer Not yet in this deck Cascadefor a CMC nonland permanent with Palinchron or Peregrine Drake a creature that bounces another creature and EtheriumHorn Sorcerer EtheriumHorn Sorcerer sadly doesnt trigger Cloudstone Curio and you cannot guarantee you will hit a creature so the bouncer is a back up Cascade for a CMC nonland permanent with Palinchron or Peregrine Drake and Bloodbraid ElfThis is really just a taster of the shenanigans you can pull off with Animar which quickly escalate out of control and into a win so understandably people will see you as a threat and try to take you down early so your main goal should be a guaranteed turn  Animar and a turn  Animar with Birds of Paradise or Arbor Elf  a shock land get those three colours is just amazing. I do recommend adding in hardened scales as it makes Animar grow quick enough to stay a head of red damage spells.I recommend reading through Gelfs Animar primer as links to a few different types of Animar deck which is hereEditFormatting,EDH,cmo068l,12,t5_2scee

Avenger is great along Prossh to have many tokens to sac to engines either for shadows finishes multiple opponents in my playgroup quite often or xenagosaltar to get ungodly mana.  Bring out prossh pod prossh into Avenger you now have a lot of tokens.  Next turn pod avenger into Craterhoof win.  As far as haste enbalers go hammer of porophuros is amazing.

2663230,0,t3_2qgzcr,Lightning Greaves all the way.Assuming you get out Lightning Greaves early enough its a much more aggressive card because it kind of puts you a turn ahead on combat by giving haste one one creature you control per turn. It also can protect anything as soon as you cast it.For Swiftfoot Boots if you want to protect something the turn it comes down you have to cast it a turn later.

2809204,0,t3_2s9ell,The way I understand it the  thing is sort of the default EDH power level. Some groups go fullon Spike and run ABUR duals some groups brew janky Shaman tribal decks and having a deck which isnt a paper tiger in the first and not oppressive in the second is a good goal. If in doubt just go .So does EDH need a default power level? I think you touch on one reason why we dont its a social format if you want to know the power level you ask the people youre playing with. Relying on arbitrary community standards undercuts whats arguably the most important aspect of EDH talking to your playgroup. Theres always the ability to have different decks of different power levels which I think is weirdly overlooked in these discussions  having one cutthroat competitive EDH deck and then others of various power levels. Maybe even a weakboard where you have alternative cards for playgroups which just cant handle your Consecrated Sphinxes and Stoneforge Mystics into swords.,EDH,cnnec2s,8,t5_2scee

2855559,0,t3_2staq1,This is just my opinion but it seems that your deck suffers from two issues. First you need A LOT more mana ramp this is why your deck is running slowly. Yes revenent and ghast are awesome but you cant bank on pulling them early game because usually you wont. I suggest adding cards such as Caged Sun Liliana of the dark realms Thran Dynamo and Nytkthos Shrine to nyx and put Worn powerstone Mind Stone Burnished Hart Charcoal Diamond and Commanders sphere back in. These cards while maybe appearing to be a waste of space at first are EXTREMELY important in making your deck run well and fast. Second your deck appears to be a bit scattered. What I mean by this is that it doesnt seem like your deck is trying to do anything special to get you the win. In your description you say the theme is forced saccing and while that is a hell of a lot of fun you dont have to much in there that actually makes it happen or capitalize off of it. I suggest adding harvester of souls and putting Reaper from the abyss and tragic slip back in and maybe finding some more cards with good morbid triggers.Some other themes you could go for with Mr. Obi Wanixilis could be demon tribal using anthems to make all of your demons stronger and to produce more demon tokens or Life paygain shenanigans to capitalize off of his . I think adding both exquisite blood and sanguine bond could be quite fun for you Edit formatting,EDH,cnsoegi,3,t5_2scee

They said they got rid of those other  sylvan and primetime because of how they took over games and prophet does the same thing while dying to an equal amount of cards. I just dont buy the whole it dies to everything argument.And for the record my most played commander is Maelstrom Wanderer with Prophet and Im all in favor of getting rid of that card. ,EDH,cnubemp,4,t5_2scee

2893799,0,t1_cnmxx9b,First things first let me emphasize that I find nothing wrong with flavorbased decks and your idea seems perfectly reasonable.I would suggest taking downvotes with a grain of salt. Sadly lots of people dont follow reddiquette downvoting an otherwise acceptable post because one doesnt personally like it or for other similarly specious reasons is extremely common.The internet is a silly place. Becoming angry about some perceived slight is most often not worth your time. Deleting posts is essentially a form of submission.Jim Jarmusch said that Authenticity is invaluable originality is nonexistent. And its quite true. Despite the  quattoroctogintillion plus a pittance on the scale of setenseptuagintillions duoseptuagintillions and quinsexagintillions that latter one being a little off from the square of a googol possible EDH decks  I counted  only a fraction of those are playable. And even with that the number of generals is so much smaller about  as of FRF. If each general has an average of say  strategies maybe not so far off we have about  different decks. So we have an upper and lower bound on the number of different decks.  is probably an underestimate for the number of different strategies that someone has built. But rEDH isnt actually a representative sample of the format as much as some people might like to believe otherwise like anyone who thinks that people complaining about Prophet of Kruphix on forums such as reddit make up a relevant percentage of the format. So getting flustered by not finding some particular strategy discussed on rEDH and thinking that means it would be completely original are questionable lines of thought.If you are having difficulty finding someone who will give you advicecritiquesother responses when you make a deck post there are several users on here on MTGSalvation and other forums including myself though I might not be the best choice for advice on flavorbased decks that would likely be perfectly willing to respond on a  on  basis if you ask them nicely and they have the time.Hope your deckbuilding goes well!,EDH,cnx11ok,1,t5_2scee

Stuff like Slagwurm Armor Tower Defense Spidersilk Armor are cheap in mana cost and on the wallet doran invalidates any power boosting stuff your opponents run you can run putrefy mortify pernicious deed etc yourself to keep people down and clear the way.Bonus style points Meekstone and Ensnaring Bridge do wonders if you can keep swinging and nobody else can. ,EDH,co0ywg9,1,t5_2scee

2930175,0,t1_co0wm6v,In a vacuum maybe but in reality small infect creatures never present much of a clock because they die so easily and so quickly that they never get there. Generally if you want to get there with poison counters you either need a big dude with Exoskeleton  Skithryx or a significant commitment to proliferate which takes up lots of spots and lessens the efficacy of a Voltron strategy. ,EDH,co167tu,1,t5_2scee

I originally built mine as tribal but honestly its only okay. He has a much better time as good stuff or voltron. One of the key weaknesses of building a deck around low powhigh toughness is if doran ever gets tucked it puts you in a very bad position.Good luck on on the brew!

2938475,0,t3_2tsjio,I have a number of decks most of which are good in FFAThis of course depends on what kind of deck you want to play Azusa Lost but Seeking  My list is heavy on token generation to get the Craterhoof Behemoth spam kill.  Tooth and Nail or a huge Genesis Wave are usually the wins.  I included an Altar of Dementia incase I run up against someone who makes it impossible for me to attack them. Ghave Guru of Spores  It is nearly impossible to make a Ghave deck that isnt a combo deck so I just went with a combo deck.  Mine is Fungus tribal. Grimgrin CorpseBorn  Zombie tribal with a mill theme.  One of the funniest interactions in the deck is Altar of the Brood  Undead Alchemist.  With that I milled all three of my opponents for  cards.  Works best when playing against creatureheavy decks. Hazezon Tamar  This one is my current favorite.  Its a token generator and Ive got more than one of those but Hazezon is an interesting general to work with.  The goal is to generate as many copies of Hazezons delayed trigger as possible. Karador Ghost Chieftain  My standard Karador list focuses on making the most of creatures entering or leaving the battlefield. Karador Ghost Chieftain  Shadowborn Apostles.  Forty of them. Kurkesh Onakke Ancient  Probably the least FFA viable of my decks but Ive done okay with it.  I was challenged to do a monored mill deck so this is what happened.  The last time I played it I milled out two of my opponents before dying. Mikaeus the Unhallowed  Super budget MikeTrike combo deck.  This one could quite possibly irritate the hell out of your playgroup because you will likely win with the Triskelion combo more often than any other way and that can tend to be annoying. Nekusar the Mindrazer  Works great in FFA but another one of the generals that people tend to hate out.  My list is extremely typical of the commander. Nath of the GiltLeaf  Elf swarmhand destruction.  This one is fairly competitive and Id recommend it as long as you think that youll be able to make your friends discard and not make them hate you. Norin the Wary  Norin makes you learn to keep track of your triggers and how best to order them on the stack.  Its really fun and can be done relatively inexpensively. Oloro Ageless Ascetic  Another hate magnet but not as much as the others.  Oloro should be cast to use his abilities.  Lifegain should not be relied on to keep you alive  life is a resource not just a measure of how much you arent dying. Rafiq of the Many  Rafiq is pretty much just a voltron commander.  You can build the deck with either equipment or with enchantments and include some measure of Exalted creatures.  It makes for an easytobuild deck but tends to be very linear. Slobad Goblin Tinkerer  Artifact combo.  Low CMC for your commander.  Your commander is a sac outlet AND artifact protection.  There are so many combos in this deck that I dont care what cards I draw  if you have  artifacts in play and somehow dont already have a combo then the next card you draw is extremely likely to be the combo piece you need. Vorel of the Hull Clade  Do you like  counters?  If so there is no one else for you.  I like this one because its a little bit control and a little bit face punching. Wort the Raidmother  A very spellheavy deck combined  sorceries and instants.  The goal is to leverage Worts Convoke to make your board grow in leaps and bounds.,EDH,co248uq,2,t5_2scee

And in combination with Abundance you can get  lands a turn without losing life.   green Walkers are good so add some. Freyalise gives you mana producing creature tokens that can also block AND the possibility to get rid of artifacts or enchantments. Garruk Wildspeaker and Nissa Worldwaker give you more mana or creatures. Garruk Primal Hunter lets you draw a lot of cards.   add Seismic Assault for redundancy.   Have a plan B in case B.E. dont get its job done. Rampaging Baloths flood the field with tokens for every land you play. Kamahl Fist of Krosa turns your lands into creatures and pumps them or your Avenger of Zendikar tokens or your Baloths tokens with an Overrun effect.,EDH,co3c4gi,1,t5_2scee

2950867,0,t3_2tx6qg,So I play standard and am getting into older formats like Modern and Vintage. I find net decking for those formats helpful as a jumping off point. Especially if Im playing a new deck its useful to have an idea about what needs to be in the deck. Ill usually tweak it to my taste and for my local meta but having a starting point is super helpful.For EDH I almost never netdeck. Its not that Im against it. If people want to get a deck online thats cool with me. However a big draw of EDH for me is expressing myself through my decks. I play commander because I want to do things I love doing with my favorite cards throughout the history of the game.

2964824,0,t1_co52dye,The main engines of the deck are all fairly cheap. Lurking Predators Hideaway lands especially the red one Summoning Trap and I used to use Call of the Wild as a lategame mana sink but had mixed results so it got cut a while back. Quicksilver Amulet is great Dragon Arch can also work if youre running mostly multicolored creatures otherwise I wouldnt bother. Hunting Grounds and Deathrender are both pretty good but depend on cards in hand  which most Mayael decks arent that focused on.The mix of creatures to use is based on where you play  my store has mostly controlStax players so theres a lot of hateful creatures in there meant to shut down those strategies like Iona Hellkite Tyrant Angelic Arbiter etc. But if youre playing in a more funloving environment they arent needed but are still very good.Boots  Greaves are important. Mayael or another highvalue creature having hexproof is huge. Asceticism and Privledged Position are both good. Archetype of Endurance is a must in Mayael.As a general rule try to keep more than  creatures with power  or greater in the deck. And my general rule for Mayael is that if somebody doesnt immediately say Well thats a problem. then its not powerful enough.One last thing  Chaos is your friend. Possibility Storm is basically the best card in that deck. Toss in a Timesifter as well to really screw up everybodys strategy especially because odds are youll have the highest average CMC deck at the table.,EDH,co546hl,2,t5_2scee

Relic of Progenitus and Tormods Crypt are low CMC counters to reanimator. Those are just off the top of my head. Let us know their commander and we can give you more if its just one person.

3048375,0,t1_cods2wu,While you have a point Mulligan has a specific meaning in the context of MtG... That is rule .gt .. Each player draws a number of cards equal to his or her starting hand size which is normally seven. Some effects can modify a players starting hand size. A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may take a mulligan. ...So you have to accept that when the word is used as jargon in a game and you use it to mean something different while talking about that game you are going to cause unnecessary confusion. It would be like talking about your decks massive blue theme while playing a monoblack deck referring of course to your new blue patio.If it is not your intention to be needlessly confusing I recommend using a different term.

3060205,0,t3_2v7nns,sedris the traitor king is a very interesting reanimator deck. Hes in great colors for self mill by loot effects. You have access to havengul lich which is great when you want to simply cast whats in your graveyard and sedris for when you want to give it haste and pay only  for it. The deck focuses on ETB effects attack triggers and damage triggers. The titans are great and the primordials are also amazing but there are also cards like SilentBlade Oni wrexial the risen deep and Scion of darkness who have awesome on damage triggers.Edit Lord of the Void is probably one of the best because you get a creature to stick around after.,EDH,cof6r79,2,t5_2scee

That being said it also sound like your local group sucks. Go to some FNMs at your local store and talk to some of the old guys I would be willing to bet a few will help you our after hearing your story. I personally have no problem helping new players acquire cards and have done some really terrible trades to help kids out. One thing that I will say is that you need to have more real cards than proxies if you cant do that with your current commander then I would suggest a different build. ,EDH,cojdesj,1,t5_2scee

3178568,0,t1_corg6ae, Eternal Witness is always worth a slot I need a Sidisi for this Tombstalker is a must Stinkweed Imp seems like a good idea Dont know why Murderous Cut isnt in Pernicious Deed is an option. works well with always wanting to hold mana Dig Through Time is an option but probably not worth the money right now. Sultai Ascendancy after playing with the deck this card seems better but Im hesitant to give up a spot for it. I like the ability on a body. Reign of the Pit seems interesting here. Something to consider but likely not worth the spot as a sorcery that will probably leave me without untapped lands Satyr Wayfinder. Ive thought about it but it doesnt do enough as a creature. As for the cuts Skaab Ruinator has been a tough card for me. I meant to mention it in the intro but I dont know if I always have enough creatures in my graveyard for it but I think its too good to take out. I want to make an effort to make it better Avenging Druid is good in this deck but I did take it out of Karador because it wouldnt hit often enough. Would like to replace it with Hammer of Bogardan Lorthos is also not very synergistic and could be on the chopping block but I think hes strong. ,EDH,corggn1,1,t5_2scee

3185611,0,t3_2wm5v7,Phenax is fantastic.  He reminds me of myself a lover of huge bootys.  That being said some combos.  I feel you arent grasping at phenax as heavily as you could as he gives all your creatures an ability but your only running .  So add in King Macar the goldcursed to get that SWEET inspired ability.  Wake Thrasher would also be an auto include for getting that buff on your turn which in turn can be tapped to mill even more.  Another creature that does well with that is sewer nemesis as he gets really big really fast.  Even silumgar the drifting death would be worth it as he can easily handle low level token decks with himself.  Plus that  toughness isnt to shabby.

3221286,0,t3_2x05py,One card in particular that I find to be an autoinclude in a sliver deck is Prophet of Kruphix. I have a sliver deck with Overlord as the commander and once the deck starts rolling things start exploding. Once you start tutoring with Kruphix on board the game is essentially over in a pod. Start flashing and tutoring a bunch of slivers on the opponents turns and you can go from a small threat to a huge one.I dont run a whole lot of nonslivers since many of them have cardkilling effects themselves but I do run Armageddon. Get a Manaweft Sliver or Gemhide Sliver on board with a few tiny slivers and you can start wreaking havoc while your opponents struggle to recover after all lands are destroyed.As mentioned below Sun Titan is another great choice. Most of the slivers youll run are  CMC or less so he naturally is a good fit.Amoeboid Changeling is a mustinclude if youre running Overlord as your commander. Just dont have the shroud sliver on board when you try to do that combo! PHeres a reasonably recent list of the deck. I did get my hands on several newer slivers last night including the white double strike one Blur Sliver and the vigilance and first strike ones. I also took out Terminus for Door of Destinies BUT this should give you an idea of what my deck looks like. Its pretty potent. I will add that a good land base is gonna set you back some money. I tried to get as many shock lands as I could while they were in standard so I have one of each in there. It really helps!,EDH,covw0jk,4,t5_2scee

3225655,0,t1_covranu,I dont have it uploaded and im out of the country for work right now. Your list is good. Just a couple mods might give you a more versatile consistency meaning youll do better in multiplayer and against an array of strats. Torpor orb is one of the best control cards in the deck. Blind obedience is useful. You may also want to consider rule of law. Rule of law works alongside mayael aok. Im not running rule right this second. Also priviliged position is great along with ascetecism.I dont mess with the cards that double down on mayaels ability like bracers or the other artifact that does it. Id rather have a removal spell in its spot. You have avacyn good. Have you thought about admonition angel? Run plenty of fetches with her.Mayael is one of those decks that im proud to have built and can call my own brew. I call it my own because i believe ive played with it and tuned it pretty good. I get all excited when talking about the general with another player DOh one other thing i forgot to mention about torpor orb...ive found that you can run nombos with it. Ive concluded that  is fine as long as they are balanced. Meaning that you have a couple low cmclow power ones like reclamatiom sage or acidic slime and then some home runs like craterhoof behemoth or molten primordial. You know split it up. I currently run  nombos in my list solemn inferno titan molten primordial and acidic slime. Inferno titan isnt even really that much of a nombo. But i hope that gives you some good info on torpor orb because it is very powerful. Ive had situations where people waste an austere command or vandalblast when torpor orb is the only artifact on the field. Its that potent.Good luck with your deck!

More often then not though successful burn is more about playing your opponent and working around hate. If you just blindly play whatever shit is in your hand as you draw it you wont do super hot.  Burn is fun because in a hostile meta it requires tight play and can have a very high stakes feel to it. Do I think its the most complex or intricate archetype around? Hell no.

Thats why I said for the Hellkite but tattermunge is a fantastic card that people have never heard of.  The main point is to make it as difficult to attack you as possible or at least make it extremely unappealing.  Doing things like making your stuff indestructable to having them pay the attacking tax on say ghostly prison are all what makes the build hilarious to play.  Although I will say it is impossible to play  on  so you need to be quick and build your defense as well as your opponents armies as fast as you can.  also I suggest taking out phytohydra.

It would need to be a completely different ruleset.I already have seen the faction splintering and Im OK with it. I will not ever enter a game of tournament EDH. Its a different format.The thing is this you are attacking the EDH RC because your TO or whoever wont adopt alternative rules that better foster a competitive environment when the EDH RC states from the getgo that the format is antiSpike. You are strongly encouraged to selflimit and playgrouplimit power levels and unfun strategies. This is intrinsically against the idea of the Spike mindset which is if its legal and the most powerful thing I know I am COMPELLED to play it.A casual focus is all about deliberately playing bad decks. The RC wants you to play bad decks. If you dont want to do that thats fine.

I am willing to allow that in monowhitemonoblue because it would the superduper awesome Bringers of the Color Dawn in the format as well which are now blocked because of that weird ability you cant even use if you still restrict manaproduction.The official rule the RC gave is that your commander is so invested in his colors he actively hates the other colors and doesnt want to be involved with them anyway. Which is a weird flavour rule and makes all generals pretty xenophobic and narrowminded. And what about characters like red and green Kamahl Clearly he has some other colors in himself why shouldnt those be okay?If you dont want a flavour judge and look at it from a clear point of view Mark Rosewater is right in saying that the manaproduction rule and the color identity rule do the same thing and one can be abolished.

3499654,0,t1_cpr0tqb,But they all die easily to removal and dont actually stop you from playing the game and all of them cost a ton.  Urabask doesnt really do too much to stop you from playing the game or killing him so he seems fair.  Elesh Norn wrecks weenie decks but she doesnt stop you from removing her at all or from playing X creatures she just makes combat better for the EN player.  Jin costs a TON of mana AND doesnt do anything for the player playing him immediately so you have a turn to play a board wipe or removal spell but honestly for a  mana draw creature he seems pretty fair compared to other  mana spells. If you spend  mana on a single card that card better be nuts and this one is.  Vorinclex is more broken as one of the  than as the general as you can natural order into him but his gameplan is so linear that you can generally see it coming. Overall this is the only praetor even close to broken enough to consider banning but he is still  mana and he would be a monogreen deck which honestly isnt too scary because usually they end up getting  mana and nothing to cast it on other than big creatures that can swing. If swinging with big creatures for the win is broken then we arent playing the same EDH. Yes he does kinda stop you from playing magic but you actually still get to play every other turn or every turn with half mana if you play it that way which is a lot more playing magic that you get to play than an early braids who eats all your lands and prevents you from ever hitting  lands for the rest of the game or an Erayo who stops every first spell for the rest of the game.  Finally Sheoldred. She is amazingly strong probably in my opinion the best praetorgeneral as both stax and advantage but she doesnt really stop you from playing  permanent types and since she comes down at  mana Ive often seen people get token generators out before she lands. of these praetors red white black only hit creatures on the board. If you cant handle those cards resolving then you probably couldnt handle wrath of god being cast either and that card is nowhere close to broken.So overall these cards dont really stop you from playing magic quite as much as the banned cards because those cards come down and establish their locks MUCH faster and their decks are more linear silly strategies. ,EDH,cpr6p3x,2,t5_2scee

3576142,0,t3_31azgn,Personally Im obsessed with having actual printed tokens for my decks that accurately represent the token itself even if I have to print a custom one. That way you dont have to use dice to represent power and toughness. That also then frees me up to use d for any counters that might be added to the tokens. This is the only time I use d for tokens.To represent actual quantity of a single token type I always use d. These are just my own rules I made for myself so I always know what is going on in my board state. It was a forced adaptation due to playing Prossh competitively since I can have an insane amount of tokens and the deck creates  or  unique token types. Hope this helps. ,EDH,cpzwohg,8,t5_2scee

3719709,0,t3_3304hy,I dont play monoblack currently so take my advice with a grain of salt.  I think its important to ask what kind of player your friend is.  ampnbspDoes he want the deck to be centralized around the commander?  Does he want multiple avenues to victory?  Does he dislike linear lines of play?  ampnbspFor example Skittles decks tend to be pretty centralized around their general and win explosively using infect whereas Erebos lends himself toward a good stuff or card advantage grindy attrition war.  For Skittles specifically...make sure you check with your group about how they feel about poison.  Some people really hate it and I cant think of a worse experience for a new player than to have their play group nerf their deck out from under them.  Im assuming hes not interested in reanimator but if he is Chainer Dementia Master seems pretty fun.  ,EDH,cqg9up1,7,t5_2scee

3720534,0,t1_cqg8pop,Sky Hussar can be done at end of turn to refill my hand and the ETB at worst gives me another use of my commander that turn and at best can turn a game around even if it wont come up much. The Staff is a repeatable draw engine as well as giving great value with my commander and being part of a few combos. Woodfall Primus is just an amazing card.Expedition and Swords to Plowshares both are just great value cards. Efficient removal is important and high value ramp that is easily repeatable in the deck is just good.,EDH,cqgd8ct,2,t5_2scee
3721662,0,t3_33134i,Thats ridiculous. If people have a problem with combos then they need to play countermagic or other answers. Im not a combo player myself. My creature count is also extremely low save for a few utility creatures and a couple big finishers. So I usually pack my decks full of counters removal and wipes so I can keep everyone else in check until they exhaust their resources while Im still going strong. The issue is that this play style also gets a lot of hate mainly that you do nothing and that counters are bullshit.What people need to realize that EDH is a game and while there are certain cards that are banned players are mostly free to choose how they want to play. This doesnt mean you should bitch and try to make house rules banning decks you dont like. It means stop bitching and deal with it or stop playing the game.,EDH,cqghuuo,5,t5_2scee

His wide range of abilities allow you to adapt to different situations in the game on the fly which has been fantastic.

I agree with a lot of the other posts mentioning Prophet of Kruphix and Deadeye Navigator but our group effectively has a soft ban on them because no one likes seeing them.

3966843,0,t1_cr7sgaq,Im actually really intrigued by your opinions because I agree with just about everything you said after tucking.It seems like you get the spirit of what makes games fun and enjoy cards that CAN be OP but can be enjoyable when played in a fun manner.  To that end your call for the reinstatement of tuck is something I dont get.  Tuck really only matters for commandercentric decks.  Decks that dont care about the commander and just have it for their colors tend to have less EDH spirit and generally be less individual and fun.  Bringing back tuck encourages people to build around their commander less making decks have to feel less like Commander decks and more like Legacylite decks.  And that doesnt seem consistent with your thoughts on the banlist.  can you elaborate?,EDH,cr8gcts,1,t5_2scee

3986089,0,t3_3641i0,I also recently added the manifest effects to the deck and I must say it makes it more enjoyable to pilot. Our builds are similar in that they dont really go the route of resource denial and more on the route of value. The deck is definitely a bit slow and can suffer from some bad draws. My answer to that was adding a few board wipes to the mix so that everyone else at the table doesnt get too far ahead before we get to do fun flicker things. The board wipes I added are mainly just creatureplaneswalker removal as wiping our mana rocks doesnt help anything. Also the more mana rocks the better! I even run Thran Dynamo and UrGolems Eye as pieces of the Sol RingStrionic ResonatorBrago infinite flicker combo. The rocks just help accelerate everything we do. I also find that Lightning Greaves and Swift Foot Boots are absolutely necessary due to the entire deck relying on the King Eternal. ,EDH,cranebd,1,t5_2scee

4077415,0,t3_379qls,You should get your mana base sorted out before you consider changing anything else.  lands is too few especially for a color hog like Oona. The rule of thumb for an EDH deck is  mana sources. Lands count as  and mana rocks count as half a source. Right now youre sitting at  total.The first thing I would do is bump your land count up to . Then replace your two ETB tapped diamonds with Talisman of Dominance and Fellwar Stone. Also Coalition Relic and Chromatic Lantern are both leagues better than Commanders Sphere.,EDH,crl1uur,2,t5_2scee
4079016,0,t3_37awp6,Considering your meta is reducing Lasavs efficacy and you dont have high hopes for its competitive ceiling it sounds like youre tired of Lasav. Getting tired of decks does happen but I recommend you dont take it apartswitch it just yet. When I find a deck is getting old I first see if theres a reason I find it so disenchanting. For me this happens when I havent put a lot of time into the deck. If I find that this is not the case I put it away for a month. See if you miss it. If not then its time to take the deck apart.  Regarding your decision I feel like you should begin looking for a new commander that isnt memnarch if youre so afraid of drawing hate. I dont know your meta but I do know that you wont have fun if your opponents never let you play. As for suggestions Geth does a lot of the same things Lasav does he mills your opponents and steals the creaturesartifacts out of them. Wrexial does the same but for instants and sorceries. The Mimeoplasm steals and exiles two creatures from one or two graveyards becoming the effects of one and the power of the other. Out of these Mimeo is the most competitive and in competitive colors to boot. Plus you can run both Wrexial and Geth in Mimeo. However keep in mind that all three are graveyard decks and wont function as well with graveyard hate. Dont overextend on the graveyard and this can be circumvented or you can rely on the battlefield for targets with Memnarch like you mentioned in your post.  If I were you Id just talk to my playgroup about it. No use building Memnarch if theyll just hate it out and no use preemptively forgoing Memnarch if they wouldnt. Additionally just as Narset doesnt have to be an infiniteturn MLD monstrosity Memnarch doesnt have to be an evil archenemy deck. Thats the beauty of EDH theres so many options theres even options within options. If Memnarchs the deck you want to play make a tamer one and let your playgroup know that the deck isnt cutthroat before you start the game. Or make it your spike deck and your opponents creatures be damned. P,EDH,crl8epc,2,t5_2scee

4168548,0,t3_38ir7w,Combo is not fun because it deprives many people of what they come to EDH for the story of the interplay.Note combo here refers to anything that goes infinite andor tends to end the game the turn it goes offWhat I mean by that If two players are both using combatoriented decks they can see their life totals change.  They can watch one person be winning and then two opponents swoop in and knock him down so someone else is in the lead then turn the tables again etc.  The horserace of it makes for a feeling that whether or not you won you did something.  You were a part of the epic story.  Even if youre using a noncombo mill deck everyone has a great visual representation of whos ahead and who needs to be taken care of.Combo wins dont display this battle as well.  They have a player sitting there with nothing on the board and then MikeTrike hit the board and the game is over.  Opponents dislike this because they feel robbed of the storyline of a great struggle between matched opponents.  They were doing some combat thing for a while but it ended up not mattering because they didnt have the right type of removal in their hand on one specific turn where the game ended.TLDR Any wincon combat wins like craterhoof and Insurrection included that doesnt allow any representation of who is winning until the game is over is not fun because it takes away from the battle many players come to experience.  ,EDH,crvf87c,4,t5_2scee

Keep your current one as is because you spent time working on it but EDH is a casual format and it makes sense that people might not want to play with you if your deck is more powerful than theirs. It becomes unfun to keep going up against something you know you have no chance at beating.Trust me I play Narset Ulamog Prossh Progenitus and Purphoros.It helps to have multiple decks so that you can play balanced games. I ask my group if theyre okay with me playing Narset and definitely wouldnt play something as cruel as Ulamog against someone who built a silly theme deck or just used one of the precons.

Heres what I meanIf I built Oloro I would see him differently Oloro essentially means you start the game at  life since no one really attacks much the first  turns and will continue to gain life and draw cards as the game goes on.  To me that reads like the perfect setup for extreme battlecruiser games you have a nice life cushion to protect you while you ramp mana rocks like crazy and then start dumping out demons angels krakens djinns whatever big dogs you can put in your deck and draw yourself into with Oloros draw ability.  Then you join the fight.Thats oloro but not boring.  just like my post was about Nekusar but not boring wheels and discard nekusar.,EDH,csumyyt,3,t5_2scee

4477189,0,t1_csurm4m,I actually really dont like this card. It gets smaller when people swing at you so its bad at blocking. When you want to attack i.e. when people are tapped down its relatively tiny. And if it ever actually fights a creature people can just tap all their lands to screw you over.Its like a sort of fatty that comes with combat tricks built in against it.

Sol Ring does nothing to get Animar out faster and it does not help me cast any of my early game counter building creatures like Shrieking Drake.It dilutes the strategy of the deck by not being part of any combo and not providing any colored mana source and does not provide any sort of protection.

If a deck can do nasty things turn  it can probably be doing it without Sol Ring since thats how its designed.

How do you feel about tutors? With the number of auras being used something like Heliods Pilgrim Three Dreams or Plea of Guidance can be super useful. As for keeping Daxos alive might I suggest Gift of Immortality Industructability Flickerform or Pemmins Aura. If you do decide to skew your deck towards auras Sages Reverie can be an awesome card especially in conjunction with Flickerform. A some other creatures Id recommend are Riptide Shapeshifter Diluvian Primordial Reya Dawnbringer Thada Adel Acquisitor. For those running aribiter sphinx might I suggest Freed from the Real.

4595498,0,t1_ct9r6te,I have to disagree with you a little bit about planeswalkers in the game. Calling them an extra player doesnt accurately reflect what they do  they cant react they cant do things at instant speed Teferi PW emblem being the lone exception they cant gameplan. They arent AI. If I want to I can ignore them. Its perhaps foolish but I can.Mechanically planeswalkers have a lot more in common with a TF turret than I do. A big powerful annoying thing that acts as both threat and decoy and takes some effort to build into a gamechanging effect. And turrets can be solved eg. Spies Vampire Hexmage it just takes a similar level of effort.That being said though I do agree with you on two points walkermanders shouldnt have emblems and we as players should have a way to interact with emblems. Give me something like this...  Winds of the Blind Eternities C     Sorcery  M cannot be countered.Exile all creatures artifacts enchantments and planeswalkers. All players lose all emblems.  ... with a little bit of new language in the CR as to how losing applies to emblems and differs from destroying exiling and sacrificing and Ill be happy.,EDH,ct9urfg,7,t5_2scee

4605874,0,t3_3dxpqg,. Id have to define it as active but it can definitely respond to and interact with whatever my opponents are doing. Vorel relies on assembling multiple pieces to win even when its just beating face with a couple fatties and because of this is very disruptable. Because he telegraphs his intentions more than Id like I have to run counters for protection and plenty of removal to slow down my opponents till Vorel can do his thing. Reactive elements are absolutely vital to this deck and it probably would never win a game without them.. My first deck was Xenagos which turned into Riku. so i definitely started out hard aggro. Over the years Ive built more decks like Inktreader and Melek which definitely play reactive while waiting for the perfect moment. but I still have Aurelia and Vorel so I wouldnt say Ive changed but Ive matured. My aggro decks are now more balanced and Ive grown to appreciate playing the longer game from time to time.. I always start with the commander and build from there sometimes with a theme in mind. If I want to try a similar interaction or style but dont like the commander I change it.. I dont think I know how to play hard control but playing reactively definitely can be If i like the style of the deck like i do with Melek. I keep a balance between removal and permission in all my decks because theyre useful for different threats and in different situations. . Again kinda both. Its a constant struggle in Vorel whenever I have to cut a simicfeeling card for something like Tezzeret. but i think Ive reached a pretty good balance with theme at the front.. Nope. although I guess I think variety is always more fun and interesting I frequently play against both of my friends wanderer decks at the same time those are some rough games. Its interesting because they both build and play the deck very differently.. Oh man. a fully tuned Azami deck. that thing was stupid good.,EDH,ctb5m3o,1,t5_2scee

Anyway if youd like to look at my Decklist it can be found HEREThe first thing Id like to point out is that Marchesa works incredibly well when you stick to a theme. My first theme was using cards like Mind Control and Act of Treason as my Removal. I would steal Creatures attack to trigger Dethrone the sacrifice them with a Sac Outlet like Goblin Bombardment and they would come under my Control permanently at the End Step.Theres a lot of ways to build Marchesa but a few of them would be Thievery like above focusing on  Counters and Proliferate using Artifact Creatures and Modular focusing on Infect Hate this one haha abusing ETB and LTB effects with Sac Outlets and using Marchesas ability to sac and reuse those effects This is my strategy. Theres a few more but those are what come to mind off the top of my head.If you have anymore thoughts or questions Id be more than happy to help another fellow Marchesa player ,EDH,ctc740f,1,t5_2scee

If youre not familiar with it he can surprise you by itS flexibility and seemingly innocent interactions. He doesnt have to be oppressive either just super effective.  Draws less hate than Sharuum.Deretti is awesome too.  You can get mazing value out of him if built right. The drawback being monored.  He does a lot of kewl things. Can be built for cheap.

Firstly heres my decklist for reference  it runs  lands currently but as noted in my other post Im planning on making a handful of changes soon based on a more tuned version an acquaintance plays.To reliably flip Sasaya I run every  landtohand spell I can run like Seek the Horizon Gaeas Bounty Sprouting Vines and Journey of Discovery. Then Kodamas Reach Cultivate and Peregrination get lands both on the field and in my hand I dont run any other landstoplay spells because I need lands in my hand to flip Sasaya both initially and in case she gets removed and needs to be flipped again. Finally I run nifty enchantments like Abundance and Elfhame Sanctuary plus a few oneshots like Rites of Spring.,EDH,ctifroq,1,t5_2scee

4670583,0,t1_ctj7xmy,Your statement has a circular logic issue.  Of course every player whos playing competitive EDH is ok with fast mana because youre required to be playing it in order to play competitive EDH.  The people who may be interested in competitive EDH but dont want to play fast mana simply DONT PLAY competitive EDH.  Gee people who dont like fast mana left because of fast mana wonder why everyone whos left is ok with fast mana.  HMMMM.If competitive EDH banned a bunch of dumb stuff there would be more players in it.   guaranteed.  Thats why you ban cards in the first place  people dont like when specific cards are required for their deck to be competitive because it takes away from their options.  It actually decreases the impact of your own skill on the game because you make fewer decisions in deckbuilding  you cant make a better or worse choice about what you put in some slots than someone else because theyre dedicated to the cards youre required to run.  Youre both running sol ring and mana crypt in those slots.Of course sol ring is better than black lotus.  One would think youve never had your Yawg Will countered before.

4736539,0,t1_ctrkks6,Thats fair.  Its good as it is.  I just win more with the combo than I did without.  Its fair to say that sweepers can be prepared for.  The issue that I had when I was in full token mode pre combo was that it wasnt one wrath.

4740720,0,t3_3ftt51,We have a few proxy decks in our group we used to have a lot more but the people using them myself included all have bought real cards. Originally we used proxies for decks we intended to buy but wanted to try out first. I dont think a single one of those decks were ever purchased and most of us realised that it made magic unfun if you stuck with the same deck for even just a little while as well as that if one of the decks truly was fun wed never buy it. Currently theres only a couple proxy decks right now but even my girlfriend who has just gotten into magic is buying her first deck just next week.,EDH,cts41wx,1,t5_2scee
4742201,0,t1_cts2lkk,Its fair to bring up  that is our attitude.  If someone objected to a proxy because it was a proxy theyd just be overruled.  If they objected because it was an OP funwrecking card theyd probably have everyone else on their side too.  At the end of the day theyre all just playing pieces to remind us of rules text.

4743382,0,t3_3fts47,uRadiophage certainly has a great handle pointing you in the right direction for slivers. Neat info saved that decklist for posterity myself. For mana hes essentially right for your initial budget build get the fun slivers and utilitytech pieces before an expensive mana base. However a color land base is pretty rough on the budget when done properly. Once you get your color pie down I would look to the Shock lands and check lands. My color leans heavily on  color uses lots of  other colors but barely touches the other . So  shocks isnt necessary I just use  and  fetches. I would turn to these when you want to color fix better during the early turns. ,EDH,ctsg4zw,4,t5_2scee

Do you have more suggestions for sifting through the deck? On occasion I have that one card I need to end it but have to rely on Teferis  and TCV to get it I think I may get a Archmage Ascension Beacon of Tomorrows combo soon in addition to a Doubling Cube to go infinite with.

4758862,0,t3_3fwz4w,This is my brago list. This is a brago list that wins around x games where x is the number of players and probably a bit more. This is a brago list that you take out cards worth more than  dollars replace them with much cheaper cards and it still works very well. Ignore the unnecessarily expensive mana base. Take out mox opal enlightened tutor tezzeret duplicant venser venser clique resto. Add in a few more lands flickerwisp seagate oracle aven surveyor conjurers closet fiend hunter. I am probably missing some expensive cards in this list. They have been in the deck for a long time. Let me know if you want more concrete suggestions.Your deck is somewhat similar to a budget version of mine. The only thing I would very much recomend you add is blue suns zenith. It is a win con a political spell and great card draw. If you have three mana rock mana strionic resonator wall of omens and brago triggered you can draw into blue suns zenith and cast it targeting each opponent for x. ,EDH,ctueep5,1,t5_2scee

4764994,0,t3_3g4yld,Tezzerator is right you WILL get shat on if you play Maralen probably before you even cast her but if not then definitely once your opponents are able to tutor up answers to her at will by her own ability.To counteract this youre going to have to build the deck in the most griefer way possible. No shortcuts no  or any crap like that. Most importantly youre gonna want Vedalken Orrey so you can play Maralen at the end of your opponents turn and get first access to her tutor ability. Otherwise you cant play her safely unless you have out either Teferis Puzzle Box or Ob Nixilis Unshackled. Shell still die if Ob Nob is out but at least youll likely get to hose someone for  first.The deck should basically be all cards that interfere with every opponents ability to do anything a bunch of twocard combos that win the game Puzzle Box Ob Nob and tutors for that stuff.If you want to play a game that takes advantage of the Maralen  Ob Nob combo without getting totally hated on Just use Ob Nixilis Unshackled as the general like you were planning and stuff Maralen into the .,EDH,ctv66so,3,t5_2scee

4772855,0,t3_3g7o6b,Most hilarious one that Ive seen design was a Edric Spymaster of Trest mill deck. He would put up a pillow fort and run things to benefit everyone like Howling Mine and Font of Mythos. Hed then use things like Turnaround Early Harvest and the like to generate lots of mana to make a huge Fascination making us mill to nothing he never attacked so he never drew before us then would pass turn to make us draw out on draw step. Other hilarious deck I saw was the Shu Yun Eggs my friend is designing at the moment.

4813084,0,t1_cu168z8,More card draw in the form of say jace beleren or Dictate of kruphix. You definitely want at least one ghostly Prison effect to tutor for they are invaluable when you need one.Creature additions would be Wrexial the risen deep provides card advantage and is generally a great card to run Glen Elandra archmage solid card and Burnished Hart. You really want to be ramping thanks to Sun Titan and this guy being best buds. Casting your opponents CMCgt cards feels great.More countermagic or Silence effects.

4813199,0,t1_cu18k9r,Yes! Ive always loved the political side to edh as it can completely change the outcome of the game. Grouping together to defeat the current big boss of the table or asking around and saying Does anyone have a way to get rid of x or a way to do y damage to z is what makes the games so interesting. There have been to so many games in my group that I am able to get people to help me out when im down and turn around to win the game and on the flip side where the person you took pity on comes out and kills you. I spent alot of time planning out my Krenko deck and its far from perfect but yes I do think player experience and general knowledge of magic plays a big part in this. ,EDH,cu18sif,3,t5_2scee

4816398,0,t1_cu16xar,I agree with so much of what youve said but it ignores the fact that we are a minority.  By we I mean EDH players who go online to discuss and brew in our free time. I know lots of EDH players who see their deck like a pair of skis its that thing they take out when their friends are having fun skiing and they want to do likewise.  They dont really have any interest in better settings or buying equipment that will make them ski faster because the skis they have are fun.  They dont want to work on their technique because they just enjoy going down the mountain.Metaphor aside there really are tons of people who just want to play and arent interested in improving they just want to come back each week and play.  And a player who commits to improving their deck every week is bad for such a playgroup because theyre working to give themselves an advantage before the game even starts when everyone else just wants to start a game on even footing and play with their decks as their playing pieces,EDH,cu1na0z,2,t5_2scee

4869217,0,t3_3hl18l,See if your store sells the commander preconstructed decks. Those will give you a good starting place. You get a ready to play deck and they let you get a feel for the format and decide what you like and dont like about it. Try and get those over booster packs.If you absolutely are set on buying boosters and nothing else look into Khans of Tarkir and Fate Reforged. Fate Reforged has all of its legendary creatures at rare and not mythic which makes opening a possible commander a bit more likely. As far as Im aware its also the most legendary creatures out of the last few sets. Khans meanwhile has a lot of lands to make playing several colors easier a bit of a requirement with the legends in these two sets.I would also suggest spending some time lurking around on here and play as much EDH as you can. Youll get an idea of what you want to do in this format. From there figure out what cards you want and purchase them online. Doing that is the easiest way to get the deck you want. I recommend TCGPlayer but Ebay is another option that works for a lot of people.,EDH,cu8avka,18,t5_2scee

4888285,0,t3_3hr6hj,My playgroup had a similar problem with our LGS. It was brand new and had just opened up in our town and as the only other LGS in town is mostly cutthroat players and trade sharks seriously no one wants to play or trade there we were finally able to go somewhere we felt welcomed.We gave FNM a try and it went great. All the decks were semicompetitive but obviously still budget. It was a fun night for all of us who didnt have all of our fetches or standard staples. So we thought hey! Lets go to Monday night Commander. Our LGS does  to  man pods  depending on turnout  and offers  packs per player you knock out. There is a winners pod also offering the same payout. Only  to enter for the night. Apparently many players from the other LGS heard about this and for the next several weeks the meta became oppressively combo oriented. Why win just  packs when you can win  in one turn? It was insanely frustrating to drive out pay  and have a pod of  end in  minutes. This led my playgroup to start powering up our decks. Ive dumped a decent amount into my Nekusar deck now and my roommate has powered up his Sydri Galvanic Genius deck. Our games last a lot longer now. I finally noticed how far our decks have come when my roommate won his pod after a  hour long game by using Ashnods Altar  Lifeline to sack Sharuum the Hegemon to reanimate nearly half his deck after taking  overloaded Vandalblast. It feels good knowing that we can hold our own and its fun to play with cards I once thought were too expensive and Id never own. But it is also bitter sweet because some of my other friends decks havent been upgraded as much so I sometimes feel like my deck is hampering their fun when we play. I understand your frustration.,EDH,cuapg12,2,t5_2scee

4908565,0,t3_3i1eoe,A short storyYou enter into a room with legendary super stars everywhere. This is the Multiverses Convention of Commanders and you are here to find the next one to enlist into your arsenal. You walk over to the bar and see a gentleman there admiring himself in teh mirror. His name tag says Riku.Riku seems like a nice guy bit of a narcissist but thats okay he looks good. He walks up to you confidently and asks So I know were only supposed to have one of everything but I like to bend the rules...bring something extra to the table. He pulls out a mirror and nonchalantly asks So ever have a devils threesome? You are a little weirded out and walk away as he yells Youll be back.The goblin in the corner looks promising hes only got a few little goblins at his side. As you approach you lose sight just for a second from the crowd wait...does he have more kids now? You walk up to him and read his name tag Krenko and as you look down he now has twenty little goblins all crying and begging. Krenko looks at you with dark sunken eyes almost pleading for you to help. You shuffle away quietly and when you turn around its almost as if a mountain of goblins has appeared.Suddenly you run into Riku again except he seems different. He cant stop talking about changing the world...or warping it...something. Maybe hes gone insane as he rattles on about making tokens copying the warps to make more tokens to add to your count...As you shuffle along you find a small little elemental by the name of Animar. He looks at you quietly as he just starts counting...you ask why and he looks up Its all discount prices here. Just keep spending at this animal farm! Suddenly hes wearing a cheap suit and tie and looks like a crappy car salesman. Its spend spend spend! is all you hear as you run away from his grasp.Theres a guy a bit ashen in face in a long black cloak that motions for you to come over. You read his name tag as he quietly stares at you afraid to say much Nekusaur. He seems nice quiet and friendly. Then for some reason the more he talks the more of a headache you seem to get...suddenly hes rambling on and on about nonsensical stuff and you cant keep a thought straight.A friendly pat on the shoulder releases you from this headache as you turn and see a...fish person? No a merfolk. HEY BUDDY! Names Sygg here. Sygg the river guide. You wanna go somewhere and talk? Lets go talk...I got all the routes memorized to where ever you need and dont worry Ill protect ya he says with a wink. He leads you away with friendly chit chat about how fun it is to just be under the sea apparently its better down where its wetter take it from he? You thank him and say youd like to keep looking he looks sad and understands...hands you his card number and says If youre ever in Lorwyn block gimme a call!You think geez...how many of these creeps are there when you see a crazy metal spider run by EVERYTHING IS MINE! I AM MEMNARCH! ALL IS METAL! METAL! AND IT ALL BELONGS TO ME!!! Another goblin slides up next to you Geez whada crazy guy eh? Namez Slobad. I used to work for tat guy and man...he is crazy! Itz cool though. I can fix anything you gotta problem let good ol slobad fix it up for ya. Heres my card! and he huridly trots off after handing you a business card as he pulls out a mallet. Gotsta go fix that crazy spider!You sit down overwhelmed. So many legendaries all with their stories and their ideas. A very muscular elf sits next to you shes got blood all up and down her side and she seems pissed. Names Radha. You want to win? You go with me. I make elves. I use dragons. We fireball people to the face. Were called ElfBall and we win games. There is no other decision. If you dont accept I cut your head off cur. And now its the end of the night and you have to make your decision...you look at everyone and say I...just going to go play Pokemon instead and run as fast as you can.,EDH,cud9f9c,2,t5_2scee

I feel people often go overboard with nonbasics and play jank like Karoo lands and Guildgates with no way to abuse them just to get more color fixing. Play more basics.

We are a really casual group most games could be ended by one or more players multiple times but they normally are ended when everbody agrees to it. That player however attacked the only guy with only  colorless lands in play and no lands in hand while everyone else had  lands in play and access to all of his colors with a . This happened  or  months ago I still bring it up everytime that player complains about anything unfair happening to him.Also the thing that most puts me off about that player is that while he spends most of his money on Magic he doesnt have a single good deck. Instead of picking up one deck and improving it he has  or  different decks I stopped counting at one point which are pretty much just precons with some Commons or Uncommons from boosters thrown in. He also wont take my or anyone elses advise to buy singles instead of boosters which probably annoys me more than it should.,EDH,cuexv09,5,t5_2scee

4992115,0,t3_3jass1,First why so many lands for each?  is like  more than Id really recommend for most decks.Second I recommend Teysa. BW is a lot more diverse than monoB. You have access to artifact and enchantment removal which in EDH can be fairly key. You also get Elesh Norn which helps you actually close out games as well as somewhat better recursion in Sun Titan Unburial Rites Knell etc.I have played Teysa for a couple years now as one of my more regular commanders and she is a blast. At the same time the sequencing and triggers are complex so make sure that you really familiarize yourself with what cards do.Cards Id recommend Vulturous Aven Ophiomancer Merciless Executioner Fleshbag Marauder Bloodsoaked Champion SKULLCLAMP this is the best friend of Reassembling Skeleton Goldnight Commander Nihil Spellbomb Wakedancer is decent not great Tragic Slip Spawning Pit Gray Merchant of Asphodel Cathars CrusadeFor cuts Spectral procession is really not very good as a onetime producer of  tokens. I would cut Bad Moon since it can help opponents and can nerf your own Skullclamp. ,EDH,cunqib2,3,t5_2scee

4994691,0,t1_cuo19pr,I do.Memnarch is the best at stealing stuff if you go with mono U but it also paints a massive target on your head since hes one of the most hated commanders.Lazav lets you run things like Consuming Aberration to quickly fill up graveyards and turn your commander into all sorts of fun stuff. You also gain access to reanimation spells so you can raid peoples graveyards for all the good stuff that gets put in there. Another benefit of Lasav is that he only costs  mana and he has hexproof out of the gate making him a bit difficult to get rid of. ,EDH,cuo1oep,2,t5_2scee

China and Japan are seriously looking for people to teach English there and you can get a hefty salary doing so. They dont even want you to be fluent in Chinese or Japanese necessarily.

Also Id try to cut City of Brass Rupture Spire and Tainted Peak. Depending on your meta Urborg may be helpful. Also the allied fetches Wooded Foothills and Bloodstained Mire are easy to get and can be helpful as well as more shocks. i put Nykthos because even in a threecolor deck it can be helpful even tapping for three or  is better than  and devotion can pile up fast with dragons. Overall good luck and when in doubt JUND EM OUT. ,EDH,cv9edod,1,t5_2scee

I would also suggest running only three colors to make the mana base a bit cheaper as well as having a better choice of commander to fit the style of deck youd like to play but thats not necessary since were building a theme deck here anyway.

Granted a lot of it isnt budget but you can always slowly make the replacements or make replacements that are within your budget.Boreal Druid to Elvish Mystic budget option or Birds of Paradise nonbudget optionProtean Hydra to Savageborn Hydra I might be biased on this one but I LOVE Savageborn. Its a good mana dump late gameSpectral Force to Kalonian Hydra Same pt when it attacks for the first time keeps growing as the game progresses and doesnt have the doesnt untap clause of spectral forceEnrage to Comet Storm Same base cost of R and can hit multiple opponentscreaturesplaneswalkersBull Aurochs to Avatar of the Resolute A  with reach and trample. Need I say more?Wildsize to Beastmaster Ascension Swing seven times get a permanent  boostOakenform to Bow of Nylea Now you only need to inflict one point of damage on blockers before trampling the rest. Also has some good mana dump options late game.Magebane Armor to Domri Rade Pseudo card draw a fight effect and annoying gamebreaking bullshit all tied into one card!Fists of Ironwood to Prowlers Helm Make a creature unblockable. Its that simple.Aurochs Herd to Deus of Calamity Land destruction and a hybrid mana cost.Fury of the Horde to Aggravated Assault An untap affect stapled to an additional combat step.Branchsnap Lorian to Spawnwrithe A creature that copies itself whenever it hits a playerForisyan Golem to KusariGama An equipment that punishes your opponents for blocking.Gaeas Liege to Soul of the Harvest Less counting trample and card draw all in one packageBurningTree Bloodscale to GhorClan Rampager A combat trick or a creature. Your choice.Woodcloaker to Vigor Prevents damage to your creatures and makes them bigger in return.Brontotherium to Kamahl Fist of Krosa Animates lands fun in and of itself and has an activated overrun ability.Branchsnap Lorian to Managorger Hydra Grows whenever people cast spells. Which is a lot in EDH.Entangling Vines to Ulvenwald Tracker A fight affect on a body allowing you to remove annoying creatures.Wildsize to Mage Slayer Pseudo trample on an equipment. Getting damage through is what Stonebrow does best and this is just more of that goodness.Mirari to Berserkers Onslaught Double strike on all your trampling attackers. Enough said.Shivan Dragon to Hellkite  Tyrant Steals your opponents artifacts on hit. Allows you to accumulate everyones artifacts sol ring and swiftfoot boots being the most common and comes with his own wincon.Havenwood Wurm to Carnage Wurm A  trampler for .Siege Wurm to Penumbra Wurm A  for  that comes back when it dies.Skarrgan Skybreaker to Giant Adepage A  that copies itself whenever it hits someone.Stampeding Rhino to Vorapede Vigilance and comes back from the dead with a  counter.Streetbreaker Wurm to ManaCharged Dragon Pumps itself for any color of mana and other players can pump it as well! Or you could go a more budget route and go for Chaos Imps Or you could replace him with Xenagos God of RevelsChameleon Blur to Fog Prevents ALL combat damage for less mana. Strictly better.Molder to Rain of Thorns Lose that lifegain clause and instead blow up any combination of an artifact an enchantment or a land. Or all three!Strength in Numbers to Quest for Renewal Swing four times and gain the ability to untap all your things every untap step letting you increase how aggressive you can get.Mwonvuli AcidMoss to Sol Ring An EDH staple for a reason and in every EDH precon.

Or just get rid of an annoying creature.Overrun to Overwhelming Stampede Pumps your creatures more.Barbed Shocker to Illtempered Cyclops Better stats and you can grow him if you have the mana.Natures Spiral to Signal the Clans A fun wonky tutor that gets a finisher out of your deck.Loxodon Warhammer to Quietus Spike Puts your opponents on a faster clock.Lands to addNykthos Shrine to Nyx Accelerates mana by a lotTemple of Abandon A dual that lets you scry as an ETB effect.Taiga The original RG dual.

5259002,0,t1_cvg1blq,While thats a cute way to generalize an entire population of people and rationalize your view people who dont likeplay blue are people who generally enjoy playing the spells they put in their deck and when the goal of another deck is to do nothing but stop you from playing all your fun spells and then winning the game after not letting you do anything the entire time... I can see why some people would hate those types of decks. And its not irrational by the way if you were enjoying a nice game of magic and then i suddenly flipped the table you were playing on you wouldnt exactly be pleased with me would you? What I just described is the equivalent of decks that run only counterspells and a wincon and thats generally all Talrand decks ever are. So no the hatred isnt irrational and they are douchey but they are still totally viable ways of playing magic and while the griping may be present whenever I pull out my Azami deck to play no one will ever tell me I cant play it and if they do Ill just go find someone else to play with.

Arguments will likely crop up during games so be ready to reference Mirrorweaves rules on the Gatherer Edit The important bits gt Each other creature copies the printed values of the targeted creature plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. They wont copy other effects that have changed the targeted creatures power toughness types color or so on. They also wont copy counters on the targeted creature theyll each just retain the counters they already have.andgt This effect can cause each other creature to stop being a creature. For example if you target an animated Mutavault a land with an activated ability that turns it into a creature only the printed wording will be copied  the becomes a creature effect wont. Each other creature will become an unanimated Mutavault.Meaning if you run Mirrorweave you should also run Contested War Zone D,EDH,cvne5yo,2,t5_2scee

5341018,0,t3_3o1of8,Well youve seen some interesting things from my decks so I suppose most of these you already have heard me praise at one point or another  but if not and for the benefit of the rEDH communityDefinitely Forsaken Wastes in Selenia Dark Angel. Prevention of life gain the ability to ping for one a turn automatically and if targeted causes actual damage is pretty good. If resolved as youve seen it can be what I use to kill people on their upkeeps and even if it cant kill people its a little annoying reminder that you only get a limited time before the game will kill you. I dont understand why it never made it into the budget builds of Selenia because its really good and only a buck.Omenspeaker is a godsend hah! for Azami and I much prefer it over his older brother Sea Gate Oracle. It has the advantage of coming down a turn sooner and if both cards are bad they both go to the bottom. Yes you then need to rely on getting other cards to actually draw  but it can be much better overall especially with it setting up turn   or better. And if youre running Blue you shouldnt have any shortage of how to draw cards.BurningTree Shaman is something so Gruul good I think one of our other players may reconsider Superfriends. Its casting cost is amazingly cheap and a  for  is already great enough. The ability to ping for one per activated ability that isnt mana abilities is pretty good too. Especially because its damage that can either negate or effectively downgrade Planewalkers to become a lot worse overall. Definitely one of my suggestions Ive gotten from here.Willbender  For three mana investment to load the trap and only two mana to trigger it its a five mana Misdirection to anything with Split Second. But its not all at once so its much better if you ask me.Treasured Find for Golgari is another thing that I feel a lot of people overlook the value of. Sure the cost is limiting where you can put it. Its also the most mana efficient Regrowth effect weve had in years. If you want your stuff back from the graveyard as efficiently as possible and you have Golgari in your colours theres no reason not to run it. Even better is when you run Riftsweeper for recursion from exile and can return it to your deck for further use.Cream of the Crop in Stompy decks is broken  Ive lost count of how many times its been the budget Sylvan Library or much better. Overall love seeing it come up in Xenagod  and so do a lot of the newer players that have played the deck.,EDH,cvudh09,2,t5_2scee
5342680,0,t3_3o6n7s,Grab the Reins is one of the best fling instants since it can also serve as removal. Or even respond to wipe by flinging big hydra AND stealing the creature with the best death trigger at the table.Didnt check if youre running it yet but Animists Awakening is fantastic in the big Xspell centric ramp decks.And generally the way to be less ruined by wraths is to either shift towards less creaturecentric wincons or to get antiwrath tech. In the case of Rosheen the first option would be represented by running more red X damage spells and ways to copy them. Comet Storm  Reiterate or Fork or etc.The second option would be stuff like Soul of New Phyrexia or even jank like Wrap in Vigor.,EDH,cvul49n,2,t5_2scee
5350719,0,t1_cvvlflm,I see.  Yes asking someone not to play after the matchup is obviously considered bad or impossible is probably the best answer but at the same time...building a deck to hose just one persons...that cant expect results in any other match can it? lol,EDH,cvvm4h3,2,t5_2scee
5351027,0,t3_3o99c1,Dont know why they get all hostile its a win condition but yea land destruction is a super feel bad moment. I scoop to land destruction too as if you want to destroy my ability to play magic then Id rather just not play. I wont resort to name calling or insulting etc but I generally dislike that strategy there is a reason they dont print efficient land destruction spells anymore. Its only fun for the user. If your using it to win I get it... I am not gonna bother with the hope i get perfect draws on the  chance I can pull this out. Nope no thanks next game. Just know I will go face hunter hearthstone style on you and king maker you out of the game next round. All my resources will go to making you die lol. ,EDH,cvvnjfs,1,t5_2scee

5358826,0,t3_3oe5wv,I can vouch for Printerstudio. I used them to proxy my Kozilek deck. I can offer some general advice that might save you some time and money. Download a high quality scan of the card youd like to proxy.. Open the image in Photoshop.. Brighten the image by about .. Sharpen the image using Photoshops default settings.. Remove the black border from the card. This only applies to everything before the most recent card frame.. Drop the image into this template and resize it to fix exactly within the frame. Zoom in to make sure the edges are completely black and fill them in using pencil tool  shift if there are any transparent pixels.. Save the image as a high quality PNG..

You can suspect whatever you want and if Im constantly asking questions then I might make you more suspicious.  This is going to happen with both foreign and English printed cards.  Weve had games where every turn the same player asked for clarification on the same card.  The card was not foreign and eventually he targeted it with something only to have that counterspelled.This isnt a problem with foreign cards its going to happen regardless.  The game has a lot of fickle details.  Do your best not to telegraph and deal with it if someone figures out your play before you play it.  It happens and will continue to happen for as long as the game is played.,EDH,cwhho1i,2,t5_2scee

5553999,0,t3_3r3vm5,I think the real issue here is the pilot not the genre of deck at least as you described your frustration. Like some below suggest group hug can be built and piloted to try to win or just to durdle and give everyone resources and accidentally king make aka the friendship decks. The point is that when you apply huge resource advantages to the table quasi symmetrically you should be in the best position to take advantage of them while simultaneously making everyone more threatening so that everyone is fighting harder to police. A realllly boring oversimplified example is spamming card draw until you draw tutor forbid and constant mists to be able to keep yourself alive until you win say with lab maniac or decking. The problem is most group hug people get how to throw together the cuddly disruptive stuff howling mine heartbeat and mana flare arent hard to string together but then they not only dont do anything they get mad when you attack them or blow up their stuff as if its  and hey Im helping you isnt completely transparent and disingenuous. Point being I tend to dislike playing against group hug but only because the pilots usually make it miserable instead of using it an an interesting way to turn the game on its ear and gain advantage. ,EDH,cwlivrj,1,t5_2scee

5558626,0,t1_cwm18b0,I disagree on your stance on teaching I think its very easy to explain to someone that the guy tutoring multiple times is finding his win conditions or that Azami cant be allowed to get Laboratory Maniac or Mind over Matter or that Prossh can get explosively dangerous. Will they learn it best when they experience it for themselves? Absolutely.I still think youre not understanding my stance. I believe that the onus of change is on the newbies not OP. Theyre the ones who are currently struggling in the environment it sounds like OP is on roughly the same threat level as the other experienced players. Therefore this is yet another instance of power level discrepancies within a playgroup but it sounds like OP has a way to fix it by helping them grow as players. I dont believe OP should make any changes to his deck in order to teach the newbies he should encourage them to make changes so theyre more readily prepared to deal with the threats that present themselves. Becoming the archenemy is just going to reinforce to those players that theyre not as good as the others at the table which is not a good way to convince new players to keep playing.All of your suggestions are terribly immature at their core.  Prove youre right to be feared by pubstomping them.  Hold their hands and roll out a red carpet for them to win without doing so on their own merit so they never learn anything  otherwise known as Americas education system.  Be a whiny petulant child.How is advising them that they should save their Swords to Plowshares for if the Kaalia player drops Master of Cruelties instead of wasting it on a nonthreat fundamentally the same as throwing a toddlers temper tantrum? Metagaming and politicking is at the core of a multiplayer format like EDH and there is nothing wrong with going about it factually thats the whole point! If they choose not to listen oh well hopefully theyll learn when it comes back to bite them. If you choose to throw a hissy fit good luck ever getting invited back to a table you pathetic snotdribbling asshole.Just point out the possibilities theyre unaware of or too afraid to take advantage of! Guys if that Defense of the Heart doesnt get removed before his turn he could win better use your spot removal! This guy likes to win by casting Tooth and Nail for an autowin save a counterspell for when that happens! Hes got a graveyardbased deck dont waste your Bojuka Bog unless hes got cards we need removed out of there! He attacked me with everything and is tapped out quick get in there for commander damage with your Voltron commander! If they lose to something they could have avoided explain how so they know what to do next time.Threat levels fluctuate very visibly  if someone drops their whole hand via Prophet of Kruphix then eats a boardwipe and then a Bojuka Bog its going to take them a while to come back. If the Voltron player relies heavy on mana rocks and you Vandalblast them away whilst also removing their commander theyre not going to be able to recast their threat for a while. Stop the scariest threat but dont keep pummeling them unless you can knock them out of the game cleanly and not leave yourself open focus on the next scariest person whos been building up or theyll take you out while youve committed too many resources elsewhere.Thats a crucial element of threat assessment spending resources wisely. If OP points out the few pressure points that slow down the experienced players and the newbies pinpoint them theyll have answers left to deal with OP when he becomes the bigger threat. Banding together to take out the archenemy is important. Equally important is not emptying your clip because when the archenemy is dead someone else is bound to become the new archenemy. OP can explain this concept whilst pointing out to the newbies who is a bigger threat at certain moments and its bound to be a more positive experience for them than your suggestions.,EDH,cwm3k1i,0,t5_2scee

I dont have a list online but primarily you use Pandemonium effects to whittle down your opponents cards likepurphoros God of the forge   damage every turnconfusion in the ranks  take the best creature every turnpyrohemia  board wipe stack triggers so that Norin returns before you sac it Norin can trigger himself when he attacksimpact Tremors  mini purphorosgenesis chamber  blockade of myrsMy deck is sorta chaos and random effect shenanigans mixed in so that I dont draw hate early on in the game. Sometimes though you can just blowup the table before they can stop you. Norin triggers on any spell or attack so ou get effects every turn if you have something useful in playNorin costs R and is very hard to kill. I think the most Ive played him for is R. Outside of the cards that work well with him you can build the deck however you want. A lot of lists online use a quality goblin sub theme. I built him with random effects like radiate and witch hunt. TLDR  Norin. Unassuming but useful. Build the deck however you want while including cards that will benefit you every players turn. ,EDH,cwnsn4h,2,t5_2scee

5628340,0,t1_cwuohir,  gtThough I guess my point is tangential to OPs... I didnt say it was unplayable I said its awful. Its a french vanilla that kills in  turns once cast while drawing the ire of the whole table against you. You can do a lot better for a  drop even in mono green.  The swords arent considered midrange cards because of the protections they grant. If the swords didnt provide a PT boost and Pro x and y they wouldnt be nearly as ubiquitous as they are. Theyd still be great of course just not as attractive to tuned aggressive decks.  gtHell swinging an Avalanche Riders with Blade of Selves is crazy valueEmblematic of my point along with your wood elves example. Traditional Aggro decks do not care about value. Their goal is to win the game with less powerful but faster cards before their opponents stronger more expensive cards can become relevant. Lava Spike is traditional aggro. In EDH Lava Spike.deck doesnt exist because youll be teamed up on run out of resources or both. Only  aggro variants exist in the format  Stax because it can simply prevent your opponents from playing any cards.  Voltron because the amount of damage you need to apply to any single player is half the normal  and you can recast your commander as a source of card advantage.  Combo because some broken interaction is the only way a player with X cards can overcome a combined total of X cards. None of these are anything like RDW. None of these decks would ever play Giant Growth. The first because it has almost no positive gameplan the second because its based around resiliency and not efficiency and the third because its just not strong enough on its own. Myriad as a mechanic exists to scale up the power of french vanilla beaters it exists to make Serra Angel strong enough for a v scenario. But they just havent made enough aggressive cards that scale like that to make the strategy stand on its own. And thats why Im confused they even tried when we could have had the Sword either way.,EDH,cwuqzmz,1,t5_2scee

This seems more like a concept than anything and the concept we are evaluating is building with the flexibility to tailor how your deck plays based on the plays they make. If the deck falls a little short due to power level or mana you can increase those things without changing how the deck is constructed fundamentally.

With erebos being a big creature you could go Voltron with a ton of board wipes to keep your path clear with a lot of enchantments to activate his devotion.Or use reamimator spells to keep your creatures on the field. Creatures with etb effects are ideal for this stragety. Black has a hard time ramping Id look into mana doublers like crypt ghast and cage sun black market just got a reprint and is worth checking out.Some of my favorite good black control cards are painful quandary  and No mercy. living death is a board wipe and reamimator all on one card. Polluted bonds blood artist gray merchant and Sanguine Bond can keep you alive and slowly leech off your opponents.  This really helps paying for with necropotence and phyrexian arena or ereboss card draw ability.  Black has a hard time with enchantments and artifacts. Gate to phyrexia can hit artifacts but otherwise you need to lean on colorless and artifacts.  Scour from existence  and steel hellkite are useful.

5821648,0,t3_3uxrdb,I always see dredge as more of a combo type deck than anything. You draw cards into your graveyard to cast them and try and set up a win condition or something from that. With that in mind nothing is really jumping out at me in either deck. In sidisi youve got jarad but no jarad combos. Youve got dredge but no reanimators. Youve got meren but no sac outlets so youre gonna have to fight and kill them to get triggers and dredge isnt gonna give counters so.... boned. How are you going to win in sidisi? Have you considered possibly tasigur? Put a couple unlimited mana combos in there and youre golden.Im more of a karador guy. I play it a lot Ive got a couple lists of varying strengths Ive gone through almost every primer for it and I dont think you are going far enough with it. Youre missing dredge creatures and sorceries to tutor cards into your graveyard. Id probably run it as a boonweaver combo karador. It should be strong will dredge how you want and be fairly exciting. Id probably throw in some more creature based reanimation but thats just me. If youre gonna dredge you need to go harder on dredge. If you want to combo youre gonna need more tutors and...you know... some combos. If you want to play the long game youre gonna need more creature based removal and creature based reanimation. I think youre kinda right in the middle of these three and need to decide how you want it to play and go from there.,EDH,cxiqrex,2,t5_2scee

5840051,0,t1_cxkyk0j, Its a layers ruling. In layer a the PT is defined by a Characteristic Defining Ability. However Starfields effect is applied on layer b. As a result CDA happens first. Then Starfield wins out. Since the interaction happens on different layers timestamp doesnt apply here. Starfields worth in Daxos really depends on what you want. If youre going the more token value route then Starfield may not be worth it. If you want consistent enchantment recursion with a side benefit of beatdown then Starfield is a better choice. You would need an anthem effect that increases toughness to allow them to live if you have Starfields ability taking effect. ,EDH,cxl5onb,1,t5_2scee

5845386,0,t3_3vax7z,Ive personally played every sultai color commander in a few different ways.Here are the most popular Sidisi Brood Tyrant can be built as comboself mill pretty competitively. Ive seen some fun zombie tribal builds. Zombies love getting milled and love zombie tokens. The Mimeoplasm can be built really competitively reanimator combo or funjanky like mill opponent  reanimate  steal stuff. This commander has some stigma as being ultra competitive so you might wan to stay away.Damia sage of stone is a fine goodstuff  control deck. You dont really build around it but just use it to refill your hand.Tasigur the golden fang again can be built competitively or not. Infinite colored mana lets you draw your whole deck and cast whatever spells i.e. win. It can also be a good control  goodstuff commander using its ability to keep cards in your hands. This one is pretty fun because the opponent interaction in choosing the card can be a lot of fun. Hey give me this counterspell back so I can prevent him from casting Warp World.Vorosh the Hunter use to be more popular as before the original commander set it was the only commander in these colors.

The PolymorphProteus Staff combo has lead to a way higher win result.I personally run Guile Windrider sphinx stormtide leviathan and when Im playing v usually eldrazi. Also the high tide combo is fun but I find in a budget version it rarely comes together. Same goes for the Time Walk cards. Theyre cute but if they win you the game youve probably been winning for a while. I have found the idea for the deck is to snowball hard with cantrips and cheap removal and then reactive spells to protect the snowball.

5871169,0,t1_cxp78lt,Seconding Marchesa.Board wipes are your friend. If you can get  counters on your important creatures then wipe the board youll get all your stuff back at end step. Living Death can be used for some extra value and gets around indestructible but it does give your opponents a few creatures too if they have any in their graveyards. Synergize it with Grave Betrayal though and youve got a delayed Insurrectionlike effect that protects itself while Marchesa is on the field. Another great board wipe is Black Suns Zenith which also ignores indestructible. While  and  counters cancel as a state based action the action of being buried takes priority. This means that their last known state on the board having  counters will be used to check if Marchesa should recur them.Marchesa doesnt mind dying but that doesnt mean you shouldnt protect her. Greaves are definitely nice but it does prevent you from using Unspeakable Symbol on her. Sage of Fables can help keep her on the field and give you a bit of draw if you have some extra counters on utility creatures. Phyrexian Reclamation helps lower your life total for Dethrone triggers while also giving you a bit more recursion for creatures that got blown up without a counter or especially if Marchesa herself gets blown up and you dont want to pay commander tax. Unfortunately Mikaeus the Unhallowed doesnt give Marchesa undying but it does make nonhumans you control very difficult to kill. If your undying creature belonged to an opponent and goes back to them when it recurs Cytoplast Manipulator can get it back without wasting one of her own grafting counters.,EDH,cxp8prw,2,t5_2scee

5901501,0,t3_3w49sd,While youre right that there are some inconsistencies in the logic that the Rules Committee uses when deciding what to ban the long and short of it is that the ban list isnt a catchall.By that I mean that the RCs list is a consolidated youshouldntplaythesecards list not a firm ban list. If playgroups use the RC list as a starting point then a new player or a visiting player can reasonably expect to walk in sit down and play with a group of strangers without any problems. Believe it or not your group is approaching things correctly from a philosophical point of view. No one in your group enjoys playing the card or having it played on them so you dont. And thats what I feel the RC intends. On the flip side there are groups that have an even shorter banlist allowing Power Uncards Primeval Titan you name it. And thats fine too!For a card to make the RC list it has to be pretty degenerate I guess refer above to the logical inconsistencies. Vorinclex can be harsh but with so many mana rocks and with so many read all of the counterspells in the format he just isnt in the same class as some of the other cards on the list. I know it might not help much and it might be frustrating to have to have to locally add cards to your banlist but I dont think Vorinclex is even on anyones radar at this point.,EDH,cxt7y4l,5,t5_2scee

5940098,0,t1_cxxr7sc,Well the challenge with him is that he needs several different things to really do any work Protection. Youre stacking a pile of hurt on one creature cheap as he is you still need a way to keep him on the field. Evasion. Hes gotta turn sideways and then connect to do anything as a voltron commander.  Life gain. Ideally a lot of little triggers rather than a few big ones. Soul Sisters  Blood Artist effects and tokens extort etc.Finally youve gotta have enough resiliency in your deck to cope with the fact that you can only attack one opponent at a time. Youve mentioned elsewhere in the thread that this is for multiplayer If your deck goes off really well and really quickly you can kill someone fast but then turn the remainder of the game into a v with all your eggs in  basket. So youve gotta make sure that either you can fort it up and politic your way into being left alone until the field narrows or youve gotta be strong enough to win despite the v.Compare this to Zurgo Helmsmasher for example. Zurgo is a similar voltron commander but he has a builtin way to address the voltron problem he wipes the board with impunity as soon as hes set up to win. Get him down and then drop a wrath or better yet an Obliterate and you pretty much win.For more casual games keeping the same BW shell have you considered Vish Kal by chance? I ran him for a long time brewed hard on Karlov when he came out and decided to go back to VK in the end. Hes much more of a battlecruiser commander CMC  is no joke youre gonna be ramping a lot but especially at more casual tables I think you might like him better. ,EDH,cxy9zg6,1,t5_2scee

5953187,0,t1_cxzyqdf,Definitely agree with this. I play at two different LGSes and with friends so my meta varies from outofthebox precon to turn five Doomsday Zur combo though the majority of folks are somewhere in between. As a result Ive brought most of my decks down to that level.Now I definitely like winning  Im pretty sure we all play to win we just have different goals about getting there. For my gimmicky decks Sasaya and Phage primarily the decks definitely can and do win. Theyre just not as tight as some of my other decks so I bring them out when Im playing with folks who arent super serious. When I do play with the more competitive folks I bring out my competitive decks Mimeoplasm EdricThats the most crucial aspect to everyone having fun in EDH I think making sure everyones on the same level about what kind of game youre playing. If everyones playing gimmicky decks Im sure laughs will be had. If everyones playing hardcore decks then a good challenging time will be had. If its half and half the gimmicky players will get crushed and possibly be sad they couldnt get their gimmick to work while the competitive players will possibly be sad they didnt get a real challenging fight. I know thats how I feel when I pick the wrong deck for the environment.See Timmy Johnny and Spike Gimmick players are Johnny aptly described heregtJohnny cares more about the quality of his wins than the quantity. For example lets say Johnny builds a new deck that has a neat but difficult way to win. He plays ten games and manages to get his deck to do its thing once. Johnny walks away happy.,EDH,cxzzria,3,t5_2scee

Ill find a cut and at least try it but Im afraid it wont do too much when I dont have that many other legendary creatures.  I like the suggestions that protect me and are still aggressive.

Thanks for the suggestions!,EDH,cy0l1mp,1,t5_2scee
5959104,0,t3_3x0yn8,I love Zada and heres my mostly updated list for reference My particular deck is focused on playing more like a storm deck and comboing off in hopefully a single turn so if thats not your schtick thats fine but most of my advice will still stand. One piece of advice I cannot stress enough when youre building a Zada deckyour mana curve is almost always deceptively higher when youre playing Zada than it appears to be because a large number of spells in the deck really just dont do anything unless Zada is on the field so while they might cost less than  theyre useless until turn  or turn  if Zada came out early. Stun is two mana but it is not an early play and if Zada isnt out its as dead as a sixdrop in your hand turns . With that in mind you want to be careful of the cards you run that have a CMC equal to or greater than Zada because you dont want to have too many dead cards in the early turns. Some are powerful enoughKrenko Mob Boss and Reforge the Soul are going to pull their weight because they do things the deck needs at an excellent rate but cards like Emrakuls Hatcher and Thopter Assembly are going to be very very slow. Cheap token producers like Mogg Alarm and Young Pyromancer will come down early and pull their weight way more than their expensive counterparts. Its why I run Thopter Engineer and Ghirapur Gearcrafter but not Pia and Kiran Nalaar mana is a really unfortunate mana cost because you will almost always play Zada instead then. Pia and Kiran are the stronger card certainly but the other two cards have a much better window to be cast in.  Aleatory is a cantrip that youve missed and while its one of the worst ones its still worth running. Youll want to be drawing at ton of cards and youll want to cast those cards so I recommend adding in a lot of the red rituals Brightstone Ritual and Battle Hymn being the best of the lot. Past in Flames is good Mizzixs Mastery is even better. Once you have the rituals in the deck its extremely easy to just go off like crazy if you overload the card. And even just using it to rebuy a cantrip is pretty good. Lastly youre running a huge amount of targeted pump spells. You really dont need that manyyoure going to draw so many cards and have so many tokens out that youre really only going to need a few any given game.A note on my deckif youre not going to play the combo version the cards like Wild Guess and Tormenting Voice arent worth playing but if you are interested they look underwhelming but they really smooth out the decks draws. I hope some of what Ive said helps! Happy Brewing!,EDH,cy0rpgd,3,t5_2scee

For example a commander like Child of Alara can be used at anytime to get rid of pesky artifacts creatures and enchantments. Your deck does not have to be built around your commander per say but if your not utilizing it at all then your decks going to be at a huge disadvantage.

Seer isnt just about sacrificing or scrying. The mana cost is . Play Meren. Sacrifice Seer to itself. Gain an exp counter. Return it to play at the EOT.

6164368,0,t1_cyq8fsz,Thats totally true I suppose the better way to put it is to always take into account the natural variance of the game and that shit happens while still learning lessons. I learned early on that mana dorks are so much worse than land ramp. But I feel like I cut cards such as Aluren in Omnath after a single game where someone used it to combo out. I have since added it because its really good especially as a means to save my mana pool. I think in this situation I should have took a step back and considered my meta I dont play against combo that would utilize this often and also that I can get better at reading a board state and perhaps not cast it if I know that it would end the game. Kinda a narrow tip for newbies but I thought it would help. Some people play one game then get really discouraged or focus too heavily on a single outcome I suppose. Sometimes it might just be that they have an ultra competitive deck and you either dont have the budget to keep up or desire to play on that level. It might mean nothing about your deck.But your examples are great. You gotta learn those lessons and fast haha. Someone keeps shutting you out with deadeye navigator or gaining massive advantage with prophet of kruphix then you really only need one game to realize that you might need some spot removal to interact with that. On the contrary if you have a ton of spot removal and dont draw into it it might not men that you need more. Just bad luck.,EDH,cyqbq5o,1,t5_2scee

With Ghave out whenever you attack you can automatical generate a bunch of tokens to sacrifice with your other cards or can use them as straight attackers. I also like Increasing Ambition and Increasing Devotion. Good cards that also have value if you need to discard.  I also run Scute Mob Genesis Wave is super important. With a lot of mana you can get a lot of things in play. I dont run a lot of instants or sorceries so playing it for  I can usually get  things out. I just put in Hibernations End for my creature combos and Contagion Engine for more  counter creation.And my personal favorite random card that I run is Soltari Visionary.

6189851,0,t1_cyt2u3f,Future sight would actually do a lot of work if you are a player that loves to constantly trigger munda. Future sight lets you play spells before you start using mundas ability if you dont have a lot of card draw in the deck. There is a point though youll get to if you keep using mundas ability and that will be where you constantly will have  allies on the top of your deck and nothing else. This happens when you land more than one ally from Mundas ability and cant cast the allies fast enough from additional card draw. That is actually why you see a lot of top deck manipulation in this deck. Senseis Divining Top Crystal Ball and fetch lands working on getting enemy fetch lands will reset the top of your library in case you need to start getting spells other then allies. Heck even a flicker package for General Tazri would work to shuffle your library and I even may look into that once Tazri is released.In all honestly though looking at your question for going through the deck with future sight and munda I think a better card then future sight would be Genesis Wave. Since this deck revolves around getting a TON of colorless mana you just genesis wave for a pretty high X casting. The reason why I say genesis wave is better is because with future sight you still need to tap for the colored mana  for spells you cast. Eventually youll end up running out of colored mana to tap and youll have to wait until another players turn if you have Prophet of Kruphix out or wait until your next turn. Also with genesis wave this can get you more lands into play untapped and if you get enough allies with the wave and you have either blue suns Zenith or Aurelias Fury you might be able to take out the table depending on life totals due to genesis waves ability to trigger a lot of mana from mana echoes.,EDH,cyt7yr7,1,t5_2scee

6201730,0,t3_40j89w,Contract is the most powerful Magic card ever printed by a significant margin. Thats probably too good. I think a slightly toned down version would be allowable though. The mechanic of ante more cards to get an advantage is a good one. This particular card is just broken though. I think you have to allow Demonic Attorney if youre playing for ante. The added tension of casting it when you know someone can control the top of their deck seems awesome. It just ups the stakes for everyone! Exactly what I would want.Amulet of Quoz seems a little lame. Like its just random and unfun. I dont think it should be disallowed but I cant imagine someone using it if theyre interested in having fun. Maybe in some kind of Krarks Thumb thing? Jeweled Bird is awesome so thats in. Darkpact I probably wouldnt allow. Can you imagine anteing your sweet foil or whatever then your opponent just plays turn  Darkpact and its theirs now? Come on. Bronze Tablet is also pretty lame. Generally speaking I dont like the mechanic of give me that card of yours or lose.Tempest Efreet is close. The randomness gives it some play at least. I would try it.

6216760,0,t3_40p8bv,This is amazing!!! Ive been playing magic for a couple of years and just recently joined and edh tournament at a little hole in the wall cardshop this Saturday. It was my first time in any tournament and I barely got my bf and group of friends into magic about  months ago. My bf and I were the only ones to join the tourney this time and we were excited and nervous but mostly really excited. And honestly it was really awful. It was a pod of  players and one of the players went infinite on turn  proceeded to cast all his stuff for free because of an enchantment basically had his entire hand drawn kept returning stuff from his grave and hand to play again and the worst part of it all was that we had barely gotten into an official turn  and after that he cast a card that was along the lines of target player takes their turn next to SKIP one of the other players like  times and give himself like  turns. The player that had their turn skipped was taken down from their full life to  then had their turn skipped several times then when the rd player was going to hit them for game infinite player bounces their creature back. That th player that was being bullied the entire time just ended up scooping and called someone to pick them up. The rest of us could literally do nothing. I tried to board wipe and infinite guy had counterspells and then would fetch them out of his graveyard after he used them. I couldnt do anything it was officially like turn  and I only had two creatures out... And it wasnt fun at all. My deck is not the best but it can do okay v but I mean... Dude what that guy did personally defeated the whole purpose of the gametournament. I understand somepeople play to win but thats really fucken shitty especially when he skipped the th players turn like  times.Those rules you guys posted are excellent and Im going to bring it up next time we go... Cause otherwise theres no point.  if were all gonna be outclassed by spikes and infinite combo players than a lot of newer and more casual players are gonna leave because its not fun at that point when youre sitting there for like  mins watching ONE person take ONE turn then proceed to take extra turns and skip everyone elses and literally not let you do anything. ,EDH,cywa1u2,5,t5_2scee

I understand that it is out of the price range of most people but .. for example there is an EDH league at my lgs that has over  people participating on a regular basis and even among my friends that all hold very high power leveland by extension high price cards. Is something simply being out of price range worth banning it? You could ban the majority of a competitive edhs landbase with that line of thinking. For many of us magic is one of our few hobbies so we put some money into it.  I myself put aside a bit of every pay check to pay for my EDH decks. I know of people who saved for a long time to get a mana crypt or their pet Chains of Mephistopheles. Instead of buying a ps for Christmas they put their money into their EDH deck. Two brand new games msrp  tax will run you roughly USD and that right there is a mana crypt. I do not know how I would handle this problem if I were the committee but I do not think it is fair to simply ban something because of price point.

You definitely want Auriok Salvagers Goblin Welder and Open the Vaults although the last one might help them if youve been milling them. As far as mill goes I have no idea of anything that works in red or white that isnt an artifact.

You sort of know what youre getting into when you sit down to play against one of those commanders. In a multiplayer game its usually going to turn into v really quickly unless everyones deck is at that insane power level in which case its not a problem.Prophet is a card that immediately takes over the game if its not answered and when it is its immediately reanimated cloned and stolen.

Id cut everything that mentions poison damage or infect in order to get more consistent at finishing off opponents. Glass Asp Nafs Asp Glass Asp is overcosted has no evasion and the  damage unless they pay  clause isnt very good. Nafs Asp is a Savanah Lion with a downside Id try not to play it. KashiTribe Reaver This guy is just meh. Hes fine but I think there are better options out there.Heres a few snakes or snakes you might want to consider adding to the deck  Adaptive Automaton Robot Snake Lord! Tribal decks love him. Chameleon Colossus Probably one of the top  snakes. Protection from Black is often relevant and the extra mana sink is great.  River Boa  Mire Boa These two are just fantastic on their own. Regeneration makes them great blockers and they both have natural evasion. Ambush Viper The green Doom Blade. Okay not quite but still very very good. Wasteland Viper The bloodrush is sometimes relevant oh youre blocking a snake token with your Consecrated Sphinx? Suprise! and the  body with deathtouch keep other creature decks at bay in the early game. Mold Adder This little guy does a lot of work. Theres usually at LEAST one black or blue player at the table and he just randomly gets huge while no one is paying attention.Alright enough with the snakes lets look at the nonsnake cards boooooring. Id cut the following  Simic Cluestone  Simic Keyrune These two rocks are simply not cutting it. Green has access to better ramp spells. Id switch those two for a copy of Cultivate and either a copy of Harrow or a Natures Lore. Unexpected Result Dont get me wrong I love this card to death but this isnt the deck for it. Your average CMC is quite low and even the bestcase scenario are super underwhelming.  Devastation Tide Id leave this to the combocontrol decks that barely have any permanents in play to begin with. Youll rarely be happy to draw this in a snake tribal deck.Other nonsnakes cards you might consider adding to the deck Equipments!  Skullclamp is relatively busted just calmly remind your opponents that while you are drawing lots of cards youre really just drawing more snakes. Sword of the Animist offers a good bit of ramp and gives your early drop snakes a reason to start swinging. Swords of X and Y are all great. Depending on your budget  powerlevel these might seem overkill. Swiftfoot Boots both protect Kaseto and still allows you to target the equipped creature with Kasetos ability. Id stay away from Lightning Greaves for this reason.Other utility enchantmentsartifacts  Snake Umbra is ontheme yay! and draws cards plus the totem armor ability is often nice. Bear Umbra is a house and reads play your stuff main phase  and use all your mana again to pump with Kaseto during your combat step. Its been really really good for me so far. Natures Will speaking of untapping lands this enchantment means you can spend UG on a single snake with Kaseto to untap all your lands postcombat and play more snakes! Edric Spymaster of Trest and Bident of Thassa are both great card draw engines.LandsOranReef the Vastwood is great with any green tokenmaking. Okina Temple to the Grandfathers is always nice comes into play untapped and pumps your commander and other legendary creatures.Yavimaya Hollow to keep your snakes alive through most sweepers removal or combat.,EDH,czeifjc,7,t5_2scee

Lets say you want to run  removal spells in your deck and you have  removal spells in your pile. check for creatures that also remove other creatures and put them in and take out your worst spells.But there is a better way but more complicated.Open up an Excel and star classifying your cards not for what they make but why the are in your deck. The question you must keep in mind is What do you do to earn a place in this deck?.If you do this you will be able to take off a lot of useless cards and will have a better structured deck.Those are the two ways i know to cut cards efficiently and make a better deck.

6407731,0,t3_43ey56,Ive been considering building a Meta Hunter decksomething that extensively preys on toptier strats but will blunder when faced with a deck not using commonly played strategies. The commander I plan on using is Arjun the Shifting Flame. My goal is to use cards like Stranglehold Ruination and Back to Basics to cripple greedy mana bases. Antispellslinger stuff like Arcane Laboratory. Spellsteal effects via Aethersnatch Spellskite Commandeer to steal bombs.Arjun is the general because he enables me to flip through my deck quickly. He also pairs well with Dream Halls Lab Maniac Psychic Spiral and Psychosis Crawler. If I equip Assault Suit this allows me to destroy hands sculpted by tutors. I also play a shit ton of wheel effects to disrupt early perfect hands and tutoring as well. Theres some artifact shenanigans too. His colors enable a Salvaging Station package and use of Artificers Intuition. Scrap Mastery and Goblin Welder are also disruptive against pesky artifact players if timed correctly. I didnt choose Zedruu because of the maindeck nonbasic mana hate Im packing. Two colors allows for a cheaper mana base and something that flies underneath Blood Moon and Ruination. ,EDH,czhzsml,1,t5_2scee

My list suffers most when I get taxed early on for example a trinisphere on turn  land destruction turn  tangle wire turn  etc. I may still be able to grind through the lock but it will take some time.

6463484,0,t3_445aez,The key to a good Zedruu TKs deck is to play global effects that are donatable and stays on the field. Example torpor orb Graftdiggers Cage wide spread panic nevermore pendrell mists delusions of mediocrity null rod etc the point is to have permanents that stop everyones game plans no matter who owns it. This benefits you because it means you can donate them without it being used against you and you can build your deck around your own hate cards.Key number  is to understand that Zedruu will always eventually win. Key being eventually. So in order to get that eventually youll need to protect yourself. Propaganda delaying shield Arcane Laboratory Moat Solitary Confinement etc. On top of that add a few donatable removal spells some mass removal and a hand full of counter spells and youre done in that department.Key  is win cons. As mentioned Zedruu is the eventually win deck. So find some slow win con. Words of War Transcendence Delusions of Mediocrity  Venser planeswalker etc. Things that can generally sit on the board that people wont worry about because they do nothing for now or in Transcendences case win you out right when it comes down when you have infinite mana.Finally understand that Zedruu is a  mana general that requires a shit ton of color WWUURRtax and something to protect her I use Vanishing and Gift of Immortality. Depending on your locks basics will actually be better than duals the goal isnt to have a ton of mana now but to always have mana so look to play  lands. Artifact acceleration may not also be the best depending on your locks. Remember the goal is to slowly choke the life out of your opponents not kill them immediately and your locks are global so that they are even more beneficial when donated.On my cell right now so i dont have a list but I can post one when I get home. I can tell you Steel Golem is bad because its an artifact and a creature dies to  forms of removal and mass creature removal is rather rampant. My strategy is to play the least interactive cards enchantments are the rd hardest to remove compared to creatures artifacts and lands. And to keep my CMC as low as possible nothing costing more than  mana and everything annoying are in the  mana range which allows you to fill the board with chokes and locks then when Zedruu comes out on turn  she can already gain value.When people tell me combo decks are bad because games dont last a long time I bring out Zedruu to show them how fun long drawn out EDH games are. No one has fun when I play her. Not even me.,EDH,cznva3u,2,t5_2scee

Just need to find space to play it argh...Im running Clone Legion over Zada at the moment since its a similar effect with fewer cards but Zada does cost less and has random utility. I probably should just cut some cards and try it out.Do you find yourself ever wanting removal? I run a token Utter End as Bring to Light fodder when I really need that removal spell for an enchantment or a creature that Murasa cant kill effectively but with all the powerful enchantments in my meta I find myself wishing there was an enchantment equivalent to good ol scrapper.EDIT Hope you dont mind me spamming you with questions I just really like my deck and want to get more data beyond my own meagre testing.,EDH,czstg9k,1,t5_2scee

6587961,0,t3_45vzyw,Competitive decks tend to play out the same win every time using consistency to fuel the deck and achieve the same thing over and over and the desk recognizes this as its core plan with changes being made only to optimize the build into something more consistent. Casual decks are the opposite. The deck doesnt win the same way every game or at least doesnt bloodthirstily try to. Most of the time the deck is much slower and is changed because of reasons other than to optimize it. The deck can changed to be optimized but if every change makes the deck better it will eventually be competitive so a lot of changes to casual decks are done for either flavor or just fun. ,EDH,d00qz2h,2,t5_2scee

Killing people with aggressive on curve decks is not easy when you need to deal maybe  or  damage in a game total. I tend to play  player for this reason and its why in Duel Commander you only have a life total of . People get scared of looking strong at the table and drawing attention so they often hold back on optimal attacks. Combo is very effective in comparison to damage.Personally this is not really my kinda thing and so I try and stick to playing with people who are in it to win efficiently. These games still are long and powerful merely because there are more people playing and you cant build as efficient a deck in  card singleton but the game states tend to be very interactive. People enter combat and kill each others creatures board wipes are real and powerful plays etc etc.EDH is highly variant depending on the playgroup and if you like the idea of the format but with a competitive emphasis it can definitely be done.,EDH,d03f2n1,3,t5_2scee

6688049,0,t3_478kjy,gtMy biggest curiosity for discussion here is which colorgeneral would bring more power to the tablegtObviously this will not be a supercutthroat FCK YOU ALL competitive deckTry to understand what you are asking here. Its really difficult to say whats more powerful but not really powerful. Generally speaking the most powerful elf commander is Ezuri. A big part of power is simplicity. You are talking all this stuff about going  color and youre just cruisin for a bruisin. More colors means more mana problems. You can already make completely solid mono green elfball decks with ezuri or yisan competitive power level decks with ezuri and momir vig adding a rd color is literally just hurting you. No elf deck ever wanted removal spells if you are playing an elf deck that wants removal spells you are doing elves wrong. Generally speaking animars ability does not help elves most elves are  mana and all of the  mana ones are double costed so most of the time you will not be experiencing cost reduction and most of the time you will probably finding yourself not having enough green mana sources because you have a mountain or a steam vents in play impeding you from playing more elves. To be completley honest the only thing you want in black is tutors and deathrite shaman and tbh DRS is only just ok because elves generally are not like a grindy midrange value deck they are normally an aggro combo deck based around ramping into  mana and sometimes a lot of times DRS wont make mana in edh.,EDH,d0b3pk0,1,t5_2scee

6844038,0,t1_d0s10fq,Um... Sorry to hear that? I dont know which part of my comment sparked that response that they give out prizes for winning maybe? but I can assure you theres no entry fee for EDH and more than enough people have decks which dont win on turn . Theres actually very few combo or counterspell control decks there. Its mostly graveyardbased midrange with the occasional voltron or combo deck. At least with the people I play with so no worries there. Also plenty of people myself included bring multiple decks so if you find one of them to be horrid to play against you can take a break from it and ask if they can switch. Most people will oblige or just borrow a friends deck if they dont have an extra.Honestly its pretty great there and Id hate it if you disliked your experience so if you do turn up on Friday then let me know and Ill try to make sure you have a nice time.,EDH,d0s2sxr,1,t5_2scee

6845277,0,t1_d0s6jqz,Storm in a nutshell is a deck devoted to oops all spells and kills via Tendrils of Agony or Brain Freeze. Its not the type of deck for everyone and requires thorough knowledge of your deck and lines of play. I will say its a blast to play but requires the right meta for it to really shine.If you want to go storm the entire deck must revolve around that idea. Every card you include would either have to further the goal of the deck or protect it. Grixis is very powerful for storm combo as you get access to all the good wheels black tutors and the high tide package but it will be pricey to function properly. If its something you want to delve deeper into I could shoot you a list to look at.Edit Words,EDH,d0s7vgf,1,t5_2scee

Aggro  We get as many creatures out as quickly as possible featuring Flameshadow Conjuring then we lay down Eldrazi Monument and destroy them.. Combo  Turn  Alesha Who Smiles at Death. Turn  Buried Alive into Master of Cruelties Karmic Guide Reveillark killing a player with Master of Cruelties that tapped out for ramp and doesnt have a blocker yet. Turn  play a sac outlet and go infinite to kill the rest of the board.Edit Combo is stronger than Aggro but less interactive and arguably less fun to play against. Mostly because it is a very resilient type of combo deck that cant really be shut down by a single hate card and it can reliably kill because it has access to tutors.,EDH,d0y4pl0,2,t5_2scee

The ability to tutor for two combo pieces and two ways to recur them generally makes this a onecard gameender which we feel is completely contrary to the EDH vision.Although I have to say that this is a pretty good example of the lack of consistency that plagues the EDHRC. Typically they do a good job managing the format but they make inconsistent rulings like this from time to time that make no sense. If youre going to ban a card like Gifts Ungiven because its a one card combo then every card that fits this description should be banned.

7036197,1,t1_d1dw5h6,Tribal decks are only overpowered if you play in a particularly casual playgroup. The most competitive decks are generally combo decks that key in on one or more infinite loops that are able to be activated within the first four turns or if you are a superjerk and dont care about having friends anymore stax decks. The most competitive tribal decks are tier  at best and most of those arent pure tribal. They just abuse tribal synergies to make their combos go off or to make combat oppressive. The tribal decks that people complain about the most Elves Slivers Goblins Wizards Zombies are generally tier  or even lower depending on the build. Its annoying for groups that dont run a lot of removal to deal with them but they are by no means overpowered. And since werewolves rely a lot on transformations that are often outside a players control its highly like that the eventual Werewolf legend folks think is coming in EDM wont even be on the same tier.

Ill link a fully powered one that I made to play online with maybe you can get some ideas from it though building the whole thing may be unrealistic as it does cost x more than yours PSomething cheap that I dont see in yours that is an alright inclusion is Temporal Cascade. Cast it without entwine for just the shuffle in hand and yard mode if youre forced to pass turn leaving you with Narset an opponents top decking to find an answer before you try to go off again. And if you have a couple extra turns stacked up and hit it go for the draw seven or both modes to refill your hand and deck and help ensure a win.Minds Desire is kind of nice too. If you wheel into rocks and hit it off Narset or even cast from hand it basically just functions as a bunch more Narset triggers.Something to keep in mind looking at my list is that it is pre mulligan changes so could probably use an extra land or two.

If youre milling them on your own turn eldrazi hits the GY you as the AP put the Alchemists trigger on the stack then they as the NAP put the Eldrazis trigger on the stack so the Eldrazi shuffle resolves first. If its their turn shuffle goes on first then Alchemist so the Eldrazi gets exiled along with any other creatures you hit then the rest of the GY gets shuffled in. If its neither of your turns NAP effects go on the stack in turn order so if your turn is before theirs it all shuffles if their turn is before yours the creatures get exiled.Also note that Alchemist never does anything to BlightsteelDarksteel Colossi because their effects replace the act of going to the graveyard instead of triggering when the act happens. ,EDH,d1kcuty,2,t5_2scee

7134457,0,t1_d1p35h5,It seems that what you mean by functionally random is unpredictable by humans which is as the article says an exceedingly low bar for randomness.Computer RNGs can do an exceedingly good approximation to randomness with essentially random seeding time noise blah blah and recurrence times exceeding the lifetime of the universe. Human functional randomisation like shuffling conversely is very poor at achieving any degree of randomisation. True randomness is based off things like isotope decay true but to claim that computers cant generate sequences that are essentially indistinguishable from randomness prior to recurrence is just not true.As the article says a chaotic unpredictable but not well randomised deck will tend in the long run to perform in a different way to a well randomised deck. This speaks to the fact that even though you may not know the order of your deck personally you may be affecting its performance on average for better or worse. Also if we lower our standard for randomisation we afford cheaters the opportunity to cheat their way through games.Mash or riffle shuffling decently really is not that hard and is something every player should learn before they start playing for prizes. Theres no need to accept a lower standard of shuffling.,EDH,d1p3xpz,1,t5_2scee

7160189,0,t1_d1s08wl,I am level  judge and I know really well this interaction of cards since I play a lot of EDH. I can guarantee you what I wrote is correct. When a commander is exiled through Oring its owner can choose to apply the replacement effect and put it in the command zone OR exile it under the ring. If he applies the replacement effect the second triggered ability of the Oring which is a linked ability will lose track of the exiled commander because said commander became an other object because of the replacement effect. But the same cant be said in the case of Banishing light. Banishing light doesnt have  linked abilities but just  oneshot ability. So there is no way it can lose track of the card as long as it is  resolving its ability and  the card goes in a public zone.So when you choose to apply the replacement effect on your commander you are STILL RESOLVING banishing lights effect and your card is placed in a public zone the command zone. So banishing light WILL KEEP TRACK of a commander in his command zone. Keep in mind that if you choose to cast again your commander from the command zone it will become a different object and banishing light wont keep track of it anymore.  ,EDH,d1s1lni,12,t5_2scee

7180101,0,t3_4dsgoo,Youve already gotten advice on the specific cards so heres some advice for upgrading the deck.The preconstructed deck Derevi is a part of is kind of a mess. Its got Derevi and a handful of cards that want to tap not all of them are even good some untappers then a bunch of cards that are built for Roon. The deck was made before Wizards really got their act together as to what makes a good EDH deck so its got a ton of cards in it that are either bad in EDH or just plain bad. A comprehensive list of what to take out would be really long so the best thing I can do is suggest directions to take the deck and trust that youll figure out what you like and dislike after youve gotten a few games in.For starters replace Transguild Promenade and Rupture Spire with basics. Derevi has a few big things going for her Mass untap your lands mana rocks and sometimes creatures. Mostly uncounterable ability that always costs . Is a Bird Wizard. If anybody asks you Why arent you playing ltName of some other commandergt the correct answer is BIRD WIZARD.If you want to go for the tapuntap youll need to hit with a lot of creatures so your AzamiArcaniswhatever youre tapping can get value. Youll want cards that make lots of bodies e.g. Spirit Bonds BeckCall maybe some creatures that make tokens on ETB and cards that reward you even more for hitting people. Bident of ThassaEdric Spymaster of TrestCoastal Piracy draw you cards. Myriad creatures are great for this too Broodbirth ViperCaller of the PackHerald of the Host. Then add some cards that make your stuff hard to block Wonder is a good start also see Champion of Lambholdt.If you want to play with the second option look for equipment with cheap equip costs. Even without playing equipment that costs tons of real money you can put together something pretty scary. Heros Blade Diviners Wand Grafted Wargear and Ronin Warclub all attach for free. Bonesplitter and many other equipment attach for cheap. It can be pretty scary when you have a commander that can show up for  mana at the end of someones turn and swing for a ton of damage during yours while still having mana up for other things. It doesnt have to be a big theme you can probably get away with sticking just a handful of equipment in to turn Derevi into a threat on occasion. ,EDH,d1ubao7,1,t5_2scee

7258792,0,t1_d22ze3j,Id like to preface my comment with To each his own. After that id like to point out in the scenario of being at your LGS it is about fairness. I understand there are varying degrees of economic backgrounds but it seems unfair for a person to invest and build up their EDH deck to bring to their LGS for their weekly tournaments and have someone show up with proxies. To play with friends or at a non shop organized tournament  i can understand why people say no to that. If the game is for funs and is not being hosted by a game shop i can understand no one caring if you have  or  proxies. Proxying for play testing is a great idea before investing! Just dont try and bring it to the shop and play me when its our weekly tournament. It isnt crying and Im sure many people would agree. Its not fair to play at an organized structured tournament setting at your shop with your deck you invested in to have someone come in with imitation cards and want to compete against you and consider it fair.,EDH,d239ujq,6,t5_2scee

7316756,0,t3_42v2il,Wowie theres a lot of hate in this discussionIm sorry that this comment is a little late but I feel your pain m. I have had to deal with the Narset problem ever since she was released. But now I have Ruric Thar the Unbowed. Just ramp to Ruric give him hexproof andor indestructible as needed and watch as your opponent stuggles to stay alive without playing their precious noncreature spells. RedGreen has access to quite a bit of noncreature spell hate including Vexing Shusher and Heartwood Storyteller and a lot of hexproof spells. If you want to up the ant throw in a Curse of Bloodletting and maybe a Dictate of the Twin Gods that way they only have to cast  noncreature spells for Ruric to deal lethal commander damage. And if youre concerned about this deck being a onetrick ogre if you build it correctly it can easily become a competitivelevel deck.And dont let those scrubs in the comments let you believe that you suck because you cant win by turn  or something like that. There are a plenty of different places you can play that enjoy a casual game of Magic games that can last up to about  turns without all of the infinite turns and schenanigans that we all hate but have to deal with. And if you like the game dont let one person decide whether you should keep playing it or not.

It feels more plasticysmooth to touch and you can definitely tell the difference. There are also a few counterfeiters that have close to mastered the art of counterfeiting them that it is as close to the original. In that regards using a jewelers loupe can help distinguish the real from fake. One obvious sign is that the black ink will be printed separately in the real copy and you will see the same Roxanne patterns overwrite into the black ink in fake copies.

Cast ANY animate card like Exhume or animate dead on the necrotic ooze and bam game over.Gatekeeper of Malakir Ophiomancer reassembling skeleton and Blood Ghast seem kind of under powered compared to the rest of the deck and could perhaps stand to be replaced by cards with more value to your overall engine.

7571372,0,t3_4j1fs5,BACKGROUNDSo in my opinion there are three truly great political generals in the format. They stand head and shoulders above the rest for their ability not just to keep the heat off of you but to offer deals  the core of a truly political card.They are Gwafa Hazid Profiteer Tasigur the Golden Fang and Diaochan Artful Beauty.Gwafa was my first commander and Tasigur was somewhere around my fifth or so. Each of them let me shape the politics of the table in different ways  Gwafa with his kind and giving nature until it is of course too late and Tasigur with his readymade graveyard full of answers. But Diaochan eluded me.It was impossible to track down a copy of her in my city. None of the stores I visited stocked a copy. Most of the players I spoke to barely even knew she was a card.Until eventually when I had some downtime on a trip for work I stopped by a local comics store in a much smaller city and lo and behold there she was pristine.Finally I had the chance to complete the trifecta  EDHs three great political generals.HOW IT PLAYSCarefully.The deck is basically a package of cards that support Diaochan traditional spellslinging red burn and a couple of flavour choices.Like the historical Diaochan herself we have to choose our suitors carefully and time our plays just right to have the most impact. Hold on to that Solfatara until you see somebody about to Bojuka Bog the Karador player. Wait to play Stone Rain until the Gitrog player starts to dredge off. Hang on to that burn spell until the timing is juuuuuust right.Theres a couple of unconventional takeout plays in the deck Alpha Brawl  Repercussion anyone? but in general our gameplan is going to be to wait until people are in burn range and then burn them with the fires of passion actual fire.WHAT ID LIKE TO IMPROVEBetter burn better pillowforting any nicely political cards in monored I may have missed.

7598526,0,t1_d35w8jg,Was thinking of Hatred as more of a life outlet for a surprise kill than its synergy with Ayli  it also works with a few of your wincons such as Dying Wish and Xathrid Demon. Im generally hesitant to rely too much on having my commander around even if Ayli only costs two to start I like that you have Disciple of Griselbrand for just that reason.Hmm I was looking at Erebos for his Greed ability and potential to prevent other lifegain decks from getting out of drain range but I see your point about him being stolen.The card draw definitely looked good theres just a lot of combos with a lot of pieces that dont necessarily interact with each other as I said that was part of my problem with Selenia.,EDH,d35wxc9,2,t5_2scee

7620124,0,t1_d386w5m,Ill take a stab at it.The restrictions on mulligans indicate an attempt to curtail combo decks. Good stuff and superfriends tend to fall in the less fun side of control and the reduction of life totals lead me to see more fastpaced games.I imagine lots of midrange creature decks and a fair bit of mana. Ramp into strong creatures and synergy more than combos. Control also has its place but more in the Mono Black mana doublers style than UW pillowforts. Fast combo is virtually nonexistent due to the rules and being quickly dispatched when they do show up.Am I even close?,EDH,d38d9we,2,t5_2scee

Vancouver.Normal magic rules are that the first mulligan is free when there are  or more players or teams. This isnt unique to EDH guys. Why am i being downvoted? lol.By the way pacman they dont even have a rule for mulligans on the mtgcommander website because they use the same mulligan as Standard Modern et al. They only have suggestions on the house rules. There is no specific mulligan for Commander anymore its not new rule  they just removed the old one when they used to have a formatspecific mulligan.Seriously if people are going to downvote at least show me whats wrong.

7694149,1,t1_d3gr8zu,There are other forms of ramp besides sol ring.  Mox Diamond Chrome Mox Mox Opal Lotus Petal and the Spirit Guides all see play and even a single dork is only one colorless mana behind a sol ring.  And regardless of its the early or late game a player whos significantly further ahead from the rest of the table will attract a lot more hate.  For a really really extreme example that happened recently to me Sen Triplets lands an Omniscience on turn  which was followed up by four decks worth of counterspells and interference from the rest of the table.  I silence him on his upkeep with counterspell backup from the others and Brago manages to hit the Omniscience with Act of Authority.  Admittedly luck couldve swung the game back in Triplets favor but its still an example of a really powerful opening drawing enough hate from the rest of the table to beat the player back into submission.  It can also be small things like Brago gets to destroy two targetpermanents which two will he choose?  Not the Mystic Remora or Grim Monolith but he will target the two blueproducing lands from the player who Carpet of Flowersd into a Skyshroud Claim.    ,EDH,d3grwyg,2,t5_2scee

7804595,0,t3_4m5bzw,So MarrowGnawer was my FIRST commander.  I will tell you that Relentless Rats are all stars and should see slots if you are looking to clog the board with rats. Besides Pack which I see you already have do some amazing work. Thrumming Stone and Relentless can be super fun.Ive found discard can be a leading cause of early disproportionate salthate in EDH especially if you make a player discard something they have an emotional attachment to. I wouldnt recommend the focus on it unless you are married to the idea.  Whip of Erebos is great in mono black as life gain and trick plays from the yard. Also I dont see Necropotence which should be on your radar.You are also running a bit light in my opinion on lands but YMMV.I do not like attrition because it cant hit black creatures again YMMV.Id swap for more tutors if you can afford them for consistency but not everyone likes that type of play.I find the new Ob Nixilis Reignited to be pretty good since when he lands he can nuke a creature and repeat the process if given time and a game of attrition. Plus he draws you cards which neither of your walkers currently do. Also I saw in your notes you say fast and competitive but MarrowGnawer really isnt either. Token swarm is an easily beaten strategy and you arent running most of the staples of high level competitive EDH play as an FYI. ,EDH,d3taqkq,1,t5_2scee

7851438,0,t1_d3yjdqg,gtArgument  Where are you basing this off of?Pretty much every instance of this discussion in this subreddit.gtThis seems to be an assumption people have that if you arent hardcore competitive that your deck lacks removal and you play more threats. Its also fairly true. Newer players tend to load up on big flashy threats and neglect interaction. Since theyre also the ones wholl be complaining about stuff like Deadeye it makes sense.gtIf you just say play more spot removal that might help the person if they dont have enough in the deck. Which as I have already covered they usually dont.gtIt is card disadvantage and you cannot win a game by continuously putting yourself at card disadvantage throughout. Thats not what I said. You know what you also cant win a game by doing? Not answering highpriority threats. And youll lose much faster that way than by using one or two pieces of spot removal on your opponents win conditions.gtSaying just play more doesnt teach someone the value of their removalNo it doesnt. Experience does.gt it actually does the opposite because if they took that advice in their head they can be like its okay to kill that because I have another one rather than Is that big enough of a threat I need to remove it. And with experience theyll learn to prioritise.gtMy point here was depending on the effect a board wipe may be better for you long term.And my point was that since board wipes are a completely different niche to spot removal comparing them isnt a good idea. The only effect that you need to compare is sorcery vs instant speed.gt However playing doom blade over damnationwrath of god is just not as good. You cant say that. What happens if you need to remove a Deadeye Navigator before it goes off? Having all the mana in the world aint gonna help you if you only have sorcery speed removal which board wipes are. However  mana open would be enough to stop it with a Doom Blade.Also if your opponent cheats out a JinGitaxias turn  you arent going to be able to wrath until at least turn  or  whereas a single basic kill spell would deal with it before your opponents end step.Thats the point  wraths are a different type of effect to spot removal and they both have their place in decks but trying to insist that one is almost universally better isnt correct.gt If something just says destroy and only hits one creature for  mana either upgrade it as spot removal or play a wrath. Whilst I sometimes agree I also think that sometimes a mana kill spell is good enough. In fact in the majority of cases it probably will be. All the better removal is just more competitive versions  cheaper exiles gives xx whatever. But if youve got to answer that Elesh Norn or Deadeye Navigator Doom Blade will do just fine.gttutorsIve already covered that I dont agree with tutors in casual EDH on a fundamental level so this isnt going to go anywhere.gt Every category in your deck is importantThats a fundamentally unhelpful argument because whilst its technically true it offers absolutely no constructive ways to actually deal with the problem.Yes having threats is important. That doesnt mean you should run .gtso telling someone just play more spot removal requires removing something out of the deck that fills another role.Which I agree with. See the above point. You dont need  different win conditions in one deck.,EDH,d3ykl8x,1,t5_2scee
7851910,0,t1_d3ykl8x,Discussions of this in the subreddit are not necessarily representative of all games of EDH. And that is the approach I take to arguments. Sure if you dont play enough spot removal put some in your deck. Case closed. I wholeheartedly agree that should improve that players experience to some extent. However for everyone else who does have spot removal in their decks but still runs into problems that advice does nothing for them. You dont have to be new to have questions. People trying to help assume they know the situation of the person asking but instead maybe ask how many spot removal spells are you running and then suggest adding more. I never said dont kill their win conditions but win conditions are not the only way to die. Letting someone else keep a fauna shaman oracle of mul daya or any other utility creature can be just as punishing as not answering their win conditions. Here are how I see solutions to different problemsDying to infinite combo or hasty threat Spot removalDying to lots of creatures filling the board board wipeDying to not having any cards in hand to respond with card drawI could keep going on but you should get the point. There are lots of problems people have and assuming spot removal will solve all of them is not an accurate response. And when I said fills another role you assumed I mean threats. Card draw fills a role ramp fills a role interaction with your own deck fills a role spot removal fills a role utility cards fill a role. It isnt just about win conditions and spot removal.Also as far as tutors go you may not like them personally but that doesnt mean they arent useful and to someone who needs help tutors are a way to improve your deck. Personally I dont like counterspells but if that is what helps them and synergizes best with their deck then that is the advice I would give that person.,EDH,d3ymi3i,1,t5_2scee

Upon resolving this will flip the manifested creature and it will enter the battlefield face up as long as it is a permanent. Lightform will also enter the battlefield again and should then manifest another card.If you are using Strionic Resonator to go infinite with Brago then yes you can manifest your entire deck and flip all the permanents onto the battlefield. If the card you manifest is a spell then you simply dont target it with that instance of Bragos triggered ability and it stays as a  creature.,EDH,d42m620,3,t5_2scee

7957777,0,t3_4o6hg6,Ok Ive had time to come back and give the deck a second look and I think youre running into a wall here with the Goodstuff Problem.Youve said you want your deck to be  tickets and youre already at  with only basic lands for your manabase and twentysome cards yet to be chosen.  What can we do to help you cut costs?The answer youre going to find is synergy and youll be hardpressed to solve that until you come up with a clear focused gameplan.  Right now youve told us that you want the deck to deal direct damage draw cards and play big creatures.  For RUG colors that translates to a little bit of everything.  Because youre trying to do so many different things its hard to make your cards support each other each has to be good enough on its own to be a viable piece of the game plan.  When all your cards have to be good enough to do EDHlevel work without any guarantee of support from your other cards you end up with a Goodstuff deck and thats pricey.I can tell youre getting a bit overwhelmed by the wealth of card ideas EDH has to offer and youre putting them into your decklist because they ARE all good cards.  The issue comes from the fact that many of these are the best at what they do in EDH on their own which will make it hard to afford the deck.Let me give you an exampleLets say you want to draw cards and you want to do it with creatures instead of spells.  Thats a good place to start.  The Absolute best way to draw cards this way in EDH is Consecrated sphinx you get tons more cards than your opponents and also a way to do some flying damage.  This is great so great its a standalone way to win the game sometimes.  For this reason it costs .Now lets say you want to do the same thing draw cards via creatures and deal some flying damage but this time youre going to do it with synergy instead of a Goodstuff card.  So you build an Edric spymaster of Trest deck full of little  mana  flyers.  Edric costs very little mana your creatures cost very little mana they draw you more creatures which you can play for little mana which draw you more creatures etc.  For much less than the price of that consecrated sphinx you can draw more cards and do more flying damage the tradeoff is that you had to decide on your strategy and commit to it.Playing and building a goodstuff deck is easy but the decks arent cheap.  The key to budget building is to pick a strategy and build into it using cards that cost . each and are not very good on their own but become fantastic with your commander and deck.Some commanders lend themselves to budget builds more than others and these are generally those commanders that have a very specific buildaroundme quality that massively improves certain types of cards that might not otherwise be all that useful Karlov for instance with any spell or creature that has a negligible bit of lifegain tacked onto it.  Seek out the commanders that have very specific abilities instead of generally good ones and youll earn yourself the ability to build a deck out of much cheaper cards that wouldnt be good enough for most decks but become fantastic in yours.,EDH,d4aj28u,1,t5_2scee

If someone has a pimped out board its a good way to force damage. Also not sure if this is your alley but Ice Cauldron is fun to drop early. It essentially lets you hold mana for responses and then use that mana to help pay for a spell next turn. Its like a pseudo delayed flash but you can also use it to cheap out expensive spells early by paying the mana half and half. ,EDH,d4m9fed,1,t5_2scee

Commander already turns your graveyard into a second hand of sorts no need for this. Forgotten Creation. Not a fan of this Windfall can accomplish something similar. Lilianas Reaver. Kinda just a dumb beater with deathtouch. Noxious Ghoul. If you need a boardwipe I suggest running Toxic Deluge or Evacuation. Shepherd of Rot. Not a fan of this doesnt do much on its own and is pretty bad if youre behind on life. Whip of Erebos. Its probably better to just recast your zombies normally with your commander. Exsanguinate. Unless you have a way to get a lot of mana or get infinite mana this card is meh. Necromancers Stockpile. There are much easier ways to discard cards and much easier ways to get zombie tokens. if you need to drop your hand I suggest Windfall. Forbidden Alchemy. Frantic Search is probably better. Grave Betrayal. This card will usually get removed on site youre better off running another zombie creature or counter instead of this.Cards to consider More answers like Swan Song Arcane Denial Negate and Snuff Out. Carrion Feeder. Sac outlet and a cheap zombie you could always pitch to Skullclamp. Talisman of Dominance Vampiric Tutor. You already have Demonic Tutor. Diabolic Intent. More tutors cant hurt.

8133909,0,t3_4qmai8,Prepare for a VERY long read.Do you want infinite combos or just plain old value  stax?Im assuming value  stax if so heres some cards to consider removing Archfiend of Depravity. Only really effective against decks that go wide and even then something like Elesh Norn Grand Cenobite or Massacre Wurm are probably better. Ayli Eternal Pilgrim. Requires both life gain and expendable tokens or creature to make full use of. Its best to just run other removal on creature such as Fiend Hunter or Necrotic Sliver. Bane of Progress. This not only costs a lot but may often hit your own enchantments. I suggest running more specific artifact and enchantment removal such as Reclamation Sage Harmonic Sliver Qasali Pridemage or Caustic Caterpillar. Beastcaller Savant. A  mana dork that is exclusive to creatures. Youre better off running Elvish Mystic Avacyns Pilgrim Elves of Deep Shadow Birds of Paradise andor Deathrite Shaman. Blood Bairn. Viscera Seer is a cheaper sac outlet. Butcher of Malakir. Its alright if youre in a more slower play group but I dont really like a  mana Grave Pact. Cadaver Imp. With Karador your graveyard is basically a second hand. Caustic Crawler. See Ayli comment. Crypt Ghast. Requires you to run a lot of swamps in a colored deck. Just run mana rocks Carpet of Flowers and mana dorks for mana acceleration. Drana Kalastria Bloodchief. Not bad removal option and beater but see Ayli comment for cheaper options. Gravedigger. See Cadaver Imp comment. Kozilek Butcher of Truth. You WANT cards in your graveyard this is the antithesis of your own deck. Run Newlamog or Newmrakul if you really want a Eldrazi titan. Leaf Gilder.  mana dork... there are a lot of  mana ones see Beastcaller Savant comment. Palladium Myr. See Leaf Gilder and Beastcaller Savant comment. You cant even pitch this to Skullclamp. Plague Myr. See Leaf Gilder and Beastcaller Savant comment. Reaper of the Wilds. Not a bad card really but youre better off running something else if youre going for a stax build. Solemn Simulacrum. Not bad in slower groups but if you need card draw run Phyrexian Arena or Grim Haruspex. If you need ramp run more mana dorks or mana rocks. The Gitrog Monster. The frog isnt that good in decks that dont revolve around it. Ulamog the Infinite Gyre. See Kozilek comment. Ulvenwald Hydra. Just a beater that tutors for one land not too impressive. Viridian Shaman. See Bane of Progress comment for alternatives. Viridian Zealot. Caustic Caterpillar is a cheaper version of this. Void Winnower. Costs way too much for its effect yes you can Birthing Pod Karador into this but Iona Shield of Emeria is the better target. Jalum Tome way too slow for card drawpitching cards. Consider Phyrexian Arena or Grim Haruspex for card draw and Fauna Shaman or Survival of the Fittest for pitching cards into the grave. Lightning Greaves. Karador decks usually dont really need haste its not the worst thing you could run though. Mesmeric Orb. Not bad but might tick off the rest of the table. Best to run cards that throw specific cards into the grave such as  Buried Alive or Entomb. Swiftfoot Boots. Lightning Greaves but worst. Thran Dynamo. Run a mana dork over this they function as both ramp and fuel for Karador. UrGolems Eye. See Thran Dynamo comment. Whip of Erebos. No need for this youre not building a combatbased deck generally with Karador and it exiles the reanimated creature. Run Animate Dead Reanimate andor Necromancy if you need reanimation. Worn Powerstone. See Thran Dynamo comment. Consume the Meek. One time use card you can replace this with creature options. See Archfiend of Depravity comment for alternatives. Grisly Salvage. Consider Stinkweed Imp or Life from the Loam instead. Putrefy. Beast Within Path to Exile and Swords to Plowshares are generally better. Utter End. See Putrefy comment for cheaper alternatives manawise. Sorin Grim Nemesis. Karador decks rarely run Planeswalkers because creatures should be your main focus. Moreover Sorin does very little another card cant do. Decree of Pain. Way too slow and costly for a boardwipe consider Toxic Deluge or Pernicious Deed. Deed is also recurred by Sun Titan. Diabolic Tutor. Demonic Tutor Vampiric Tutor Eladamris Call Sidisi Undead Vizier and Enlightened Tutor are probably much better tutors and are cheaper. Ever After. See Whip of Erebos comment for better reanimation options. Explosive Vegetation. Kinda slow and mana dorks are preferable. Mulch. See Grisly Salvage comment for alternatives. Victimize. See Whip of Erebos comment for reanimation options. Cryptolith Rite. Not bad but personally I found this to be a bit slow consider mana dorks or mana rocks.Cards to add aside from what Ive mentioned above  CMC mana dorks. See Beastcaller Savant comment for a good number of them. They accelerate your mana early on can act as chump blockers fuel Karador and can be pitched for cards via Skullclamp or Grim Haruspex. Sun Titan. I can more or less assure you this is a white EDH staple. Almost every deck that runs white will want this it can recur fetches enchantments artifacts and small creatures moreover it has a very strong body  with vigilance. This can also reanimate things by grabbing Animate Dead or Necromancy from your grave. Pure value. Karmic Guide. Its a reuseable  mana reanimation spell of sorts for Karador. Play this and use it to grab more expensive creatures from your grave. can also be grabbed by Reveillark Reveillark. Can grab lots of creatures. Also can infinite with Karmic Guide and a sacrifice outlet. Thalia Guardian of Thraben. This slows down noncreature strategies Karador runs mostly creatures.  mana counterspells are now  mana  mana removals are now  mana etc. Can also be pitched to Skullclamp due to having  toughness. Hushwing Gryff. Completely shuts down ETB decks until removed. Moreover it has flash. Gaddock Teeg. Hoses any deck that runs big spells or tries to cheat out big spells such as Narset or Maelstrom Wanderer decks. Aven Mindcensor. Hoses tutors which almost every deck runs especially competitive ones. Hokori Dust Drinker. Winter Orb on a creature. Best to run both if youre going full stax. Linvala Keeper of Silence. Good activated ability hate can outright stop some commanders such as Jhoira and Scion of the UrDragon. Peacekeeper. Stops combatcentric decks completely. Moreover decks like Narset or Brago rely on attacking. Kami of False Hope. Similar to Peacekeeper stops combatcentric decks dead in their tracks. Containment Priest. Stops reanimation decks or decks that cheat creatures into play completely. Rarely hurts your own deck since Karador casts.Stax is meant to slow your opponents down and disrupt their resources but it will not net you a victory alone usually. You generally need a win condition of sorts most Karador decks run an infinite combo or three. If youre playing in a more casual or slower group you could just beat people down with big value creatures like Ulamog or Wurmcoil.,EDH,d4ubpe3,3,t5_2scee

8190129,0,t1_d50wc88,Im not looking for anything super competitive just to have excellent synergy and do some fun stuff. The reason I picked up Commander as my main format was that I played super casually until I started playing Modern but realized doing janky casual stuff was why I loved the game. I left out Blood Crypt and also Dragonskull Summit due to not having very many red or black costs. I think you hit the nail on the head with my inclusion of things like Ancient Ziggurat. What is your opinion on Reflecting Pool? Ill definitely add in a Rhystic Study and Sylvan Library as I already have copies of those. I was getting around my lack of card draw by tutoring up Sea Gate Loremaster when needed but that isnt always an option. As for my local meta I have two playgroups. One has an Avacyn Angel of Hope Nahiri the Lithomancer Ghave Guru of Spores and a Scion of the UrDragon. The Ghave player and Scion player both have combos that can kill everyone else in one turn but the other two arent much of a threat. The other playgroup is very very aggressive with commanders like Ezuri Claw of Progress and Rakdos Lord of Riots.I feel like Im hitting the colors I need most of the time I was thinking of putting in Cryptolith Rite or Prismatic Omen. As for artifact ramp while my budget is decent dropping  on a Mana Crypt is a bit over the top for how casually I tend to play.Thank you so much for your recommendations Ill get to making a second draft.,EDH,d51bg0q,1,t5_2scee

On the note of tokens a life gain token deck with Pariah effects on something indestructible to deal with commander damage would probably make OP unkillable if they wont use removal.On a side note OP could also build a deck that tends to explode and kill one person quickly in order to force the focusing issue. This would also encourage the use of counters as a defensive measure as well as preemptive removal.The more I think about this the more it feels like deckbuilding against a person that intentionally handicaps themselves.,EDH,d540196,2,t5_2scee

8240440,0,t1_d57l6bq,I agree with this. I play Skullbriar Voltron. In a facetoface situation the deck preforms very well and usually nets me a win. On the other hand if i use it in a multiplayer game things will turn way more complex. Independently of how big Skullbriar will get hell run out of steam so to say. Maybe i manage to take out an opponent early on with a Tainted Strike and some pump if Im lucky but at that point Ill have the whole table against me as soon as i set my sights on target nr. because everyone has seen the deck as a threat and they get that you can only take them out one at a time because youre playing a Voltron.Having the  life actually gives me a buffer which allows me to pick up some momentum again with cards like Necropotence andor Sylvan Library. ,EDH,d57m0g4,3,t5_2scee

8241547,0,t3_4s7il5,For me I dont have much experience with ramp decks but I find fun comes from a combination of interactivity and variability. Interactivity can be increased directly through cards like Skullwinder that force you to involve your opponent rather than just drop land gt play threat. Another way to increase variability is to include some answers in your deck but you seem to have some already so thats okay. And lastly I would diversify and tone down some of your threats. Whilst Ulamog and Kozilek probably win more than the Howl of the Night Pack you mentioned it might be a bit easier to face off against a Hydra Broodmaster for example.And secondly is variability. I think games are more fun when something different happens every game. Unfortunately this means cutting some really strong cards like Green Suns Zenith and Ring of Three Wishes. You can really put whatever in your deck to replace these cards but I think between the stacks of draw and ramp you have you dont need the added consistency of tutors.Honestly though this is very much play group dependent. It really depends on what your opponents are struggling with and trying to tone down that aspect of the deck without losing its identity.,EDH,d57qz5j,1,t5_2scee

8290672,0,t3_4syshv,gtBasically I need some help in deciding what kind of deck I should play that wont make everyone at the table groan when I sit down to play with it.Like everyone else has said this has more to do with the players than the deck. My main deck is RuneTail Kitsune Ascendant and when most people see it they moan and groan and if I play about  things through turns  Im usually driven out of the game in a  vs  fashion Woah that Animar is about to go nighinfinite next turn.... but we cant let that RuneTail player cast Tithe! Destroy him instead! I guess we can let Narset get three combat phases and cast OmniscienceEnter the Inifinite... But that RuneTail guy? He might win the game with that lone Sun Titan better destroy everything he owns! Ugh hes got a Grand Abolisher on the field. I dont care if he hasnt cast anything in five turns we cant let such things exist!.  of the time my opponents at my lgs have a deck that costs x what mine does have stupid powerful cards and combos yet will complain about how degenerate my commander could be before they consider the decks shortcomings mono colour leads to a small toolbox of answers has to get creatures to the combat phase many times to win cannot draw cards worth shit comparatively. It usually takes a few games for my opponents to realize that just a few kill spells keeping me below  life easy to do and enchantmentgeneral permanent removal something every edh deck should run make it hard for me to come back. I dont run infinite combos I dont run infinite life but I do play a handful value recursion pieces because like you Id like to be able to use the good cards Ive collected and win occasionally in short I keep it fair  it has a strong gimmick  but it only wins with a few good beaters. Point Im trying to get at is I wouldnt change your decks but let your opponents know your deck can be beaten and how. Even if all it takes is dropping the occasional Damn destroying my  really screwed me over good play! or Man my deck cant function if I dont get . If they still dont bother to change after that I dont know if theres more you can do thatd be worth your while sadly. ,EDH,d5dw5ii,2,t5_2scee

8422906,0,t3_4uyt91,I have a Daxos list with some elements of Voltron but my Auras are limited only to those which can protect Daxos Gift of Immortality Indestructibility. Shielded by faith etc.Daxos does not inherently protect himself and its hard to protect him with Auras if someone else has instant removal. About the only thing going for him are his low cost and low threat level hes easy to recast if hes removed and unlikely to be on anyones radar to get removed anyway. If you buff him up with more enchantments and try to win with Commander Damage youre just making him a bigger target.Instead my main wincon is Parallax Wave  Opalescence to trigger all the Constellations. With Grim Guardian thats an infinite damage engine. Agent of Erebos is repeatable graveyard exile. Doomwake Giant is a onesided board wipe. Even without an additional piece you can blink to negate combat damage put creatures with triggered abilities in timeout for a turn or two and in a cutthroat game you can stack the triggers in such a way that you permanently exile everyone elses everything.Plan B is EXP counters and Tokens. If all else fails Daxos is easy to recast and usually leaves enough open mana to make at least one token or add at least  EXP counter. Usually doesnt win but at least it keeps the deck relevant if the main plan falls through.,EDH,d5uelff,2,t5_2scee

8502086,0,t3_4w5b01,Just fyi if youve got infinite colored mana with Tasigur theres no need to waste a slot on something like Blue Suns Zenith. Just Beast Within all their permanents then Reality Shift to exile their decks. Both cards you already want to be running.Anyways PalinchronDeadeye is the simplest but if you really want to make it harder for yourself you can do something like Earthcraft  Phyrexian Altar  Squirrel Nest. Or Phyrexian Altar  Gravecrawler  Earthcraft  any zombie if you want to make it even more convoluted. Honestly I dont think your group will be fooled. The power of Tasigur is his ability to run about  answers and recur them as needed. Making it take longer to assemble the win is less giving opponents a chance and more playing with your food. That said if I was gonna do this Id probably just run the Gitrog combo  Dakmor Salvage Gitrog Monster Skirge Familiar Eldrazi titan in the . Pitch salvage to skirge familiar over and over dredging Salvage every time drawing infinite cards and making infinite black mana. Then you can just Exsanguinate the table or something.

It seems that he broke the spirit of the rule while only bending the letter of the rule. It has far less to do with budget and far more to do with how OP designed his deck.,EDH,d66i1g9,1,t5_2scee
8521624,0,t3_4wco27,Very meta dependent. If you have a lot of creature combat at your table running a couple of fog effects is just smart. Other have already mentioned the value of powerful spot removal in cases where its only one creature swinging other options include the very few punishing fog effects such as Mirror Match which guarantees youll at least trade. Either way you want to run the recurrable fog effects such as the previously mentioned spore frog or buyback Constant Mists ,EDH,d66ripw,1,t5_2scee
8522220,0,t3_4wek1k,Heres my Karrthus list.Once upon a time it was Dragon Tribal but now its classic Jund with some dragons. The deck runs a fairly grindy game most of the time although against slower decks you can eek out a quick voltron win with Karrthus.The fact that Karrthus is a  with flying and haste makes him pretty damn solid as a finisher. I find that most people deal with creatures via board wipes and those are sorcery speed so you can just cast Karrthus again anyways and hes good to go right away.Against most decks you have plenty of tools to deal with almost every possible strategy until you grind your opponents out and find some finishers. Theres also few tutors to help you get what you need to react properly or end the game.All that being said though If you want something really competitive youre better off going Prosh infinite combo. I find that in EDH its almost always better to go proactive as opposed to reactive but I just like playing reactive more.,EDH,d66u7kz,1,t5_2scee

8546105,0,t1_d694jom,For reference this is my own Ozrhov EDH deck VishKal Blood Arbiter You curve is generally lower than my own so I wouldnt copy it down the mana baseramp directly but it should give some ideas of what to run.For most EDH decks I typically promote the use of mostly Mana rocks that produce more than two mana such as Worn Powerstone Thran Dynamo UrGolems Eye Sisays Ring and Hedron Archive. The one color producers are important to have as well but arent as good at powering out the lategame EDH spells as soon as possible. If your mana base will mostly be basics to start off with though I would probably recommend a touch more focus on mana rocks that also fix mana instead of colorless  mana producers.As for the mana base its basically just whatever dual lands you can afford. I would definitely get all of the common ones first Orzhov Basilica Orzhov Guildgate Scoured Barrens and Forsaken Sanctuary Maybe Salt Flats too. Esper Panorama isnt that bad either though I mostly use it as an extra shuffle for my Senseis Divining Top.For some of the more unique lands I would recommend Temple of the False God and Reliquary Tower Youd be surprised when sometimes you receive sudden bursts of card draw. Urborg  Cabal Coffers could definitely be something to consider especially since you are already running Crypt Ghast. Nyxthos Shrine to Nyx can also be a powerhouse though the safer bet would probably be to purchase dual lands before you go too heavy on the colorless land count.Hope this helps.,EDH,d69u1l8,1,t5_2scee

People WILL be holding lots and lots of removal up as well as boardwipes and the like. The best way to by pass these issues is  A. Making sure you cast Rakdos at the most opportune time whether its ASAP or  turns in.  B. Making sure your creatures are all immediately relevent. They should have a good cast trigger a good ETB trigger or a good death trigger. Making sure they do one of those things garuntees you dont get your  annihilator wiped before it did anything. If your creatures have abilities on top of being big like Conduit of Ruin Ulamog the Ceaseless Hunger Knollspine Dragon you will be much better off than just running out steel hellkite and Wurmcoil engine trap BTW not actually good in the deckAnother big point is that you shouldnt overextend meaning dont cast everything you possibly can if you think theres even a slight chance of someone dropping a wrath. If you keep  cards in hand always you can do a lot of bluffing and even if it is a bluff and they wrath you have a good hand of fuel to restart.The infinite combo is nice but meet ancestral statues big brother Cloudstone Curio which makes any  eldrazi go infinite assuming you have rakdos and enough damage to make their cmc . having an ulamog as any of the two gets you a full board wipe kozilek draws your deck distended mindbender makes every opponent discard all nonlands.If you have ANY questions about running the riot lord himself I will always be willing to help. If you decide to take this route throw up a decklist when youre done and Ill pick it apart and make suggestions based off of my experience with the deck.Happy rioting,EDH,d6cthfs,8,t5_2scee

Or Goad a few creatures one turn and then next turn play a bunch of that guys spells because he wont have any blockers.

Your best bet is to either find a new group or get your current group to step up their game. Any idea why they build like that? Is it a budgetary restriction or just access to cards? Are they newer players? Something is keeping them from making decks that do more than stompy creatures with no evasion.,EDH,d6qjrt0,3,t5_2scee

8706191,0,t3_4z6vb8,Okay so a few quick suggestions. Try to keep with the unblockable subtheme. Artifacts enchantments  abilities you name it Its super fun and nothing feels better than when your commander swings and actually connects!. It doesnt have to be Voltron. Just because your commander is about dealing combat damage to a player you dont have to put him in a full suit and try to swing for  thats not really feasible for such a low power commander. That being said you can still be commandercentric. Like I said you can stick with unblockable itll make sure he triggers and you get free shit. Want to make sure he doesnt die to any ordinary hatebears? Look for enchantments and equipment that have utility and also boost his toughness to  or more even look for stuff that gives him things like indestructibility for multiple blocker scenarios. . Keep multiple outs. You say the deck feels directionless that may be okay right now. I try to have multiple avenues to victory in all my decks. Dont want just the commander damage win? Keep a few other big creatures Dont worry I see your Drogskol Reaver in there to help you get there. You could even keep some hard locks in your deck some infinites whatever thats your choice. Heck you could even have the copy sub theme full blown with cards like Clone Legion Rite of Replication and Stolen Identity which is very fun when paired with unblockable..... No seriously I gotta say Ive tried it and its super fun.. Make it yours. In the end lean towards your play style. Do you love running a token deck? Go for it! This is commander the land of golden opportunity when it comes to off the wall strategies! I dont want to tell you how to build it nor will I because then its my build not yours. . Have fun with it. Daxos is a super cool commander and I would love to hear how the deck turns out!,EDH,d6twpvr,2,t5_2scee

8718592,0,t1_d6ut4go,glahtiguys comment is a good one Ghave is poor to board wipes. WBG in general is weak to board wipes but Karador is a good bit more resilient than Ghave. Reducing interaction is normally the first suggestion to newer comboGhave players. I run Defense Grid Grand Abolisher and Dosan the Falling Leaf for this. You generally dont want to tutor for these instead if youve got one its beneficial to wait a turn or two to combo and protect yourself with these first. Otherwise I find its better to try for early combo in less interactive playgroups and rely on recursion to rebuild destroyed pieces especially Reveillark  Sun Titan stuff. Argivian Find is an often overlooked instant that gets ArtifactsEnchantments back to supplement WBGs strong creature recursion.Try to combo if you succeed you win. If you fail you either need to recur pieces tutordraw new pieces or play what youve help back in hand to work towards the next combo. Ghave gets disrupted so you need to be ready and immediately start thinking of which avenue to spend your resources for the fastest rebuild. A tutor is always reliable but draw sources like Skullclamp and Fecudity can do wonders when in the presence of half a combo piece like Cathars Crusade Earthcraft or Ashnods Altar. You may not be infinite but spend mana  at a time and youll be able to cycle through enough to find another piece.Recursion is nice depends on whether you want to try creature based recursion with loop potential for win or more responsive recursion with reanimation spells. Reanimation is nice if Ghave gets killed early and you put him in the graveyard. You can land a combo piece and get some resources  then drop a combo piece or reanimate Ghave see what happens if nothing do the other thing and BAM youve got  pieces to a combo.The primer linked above Primer Linked here by U does a great job of outlining comboGhaves potential. You will always lose in groups with sufficient disruption unless youre ready to seek the rd and th lines of play. I always assume Im trying to combo after the nd board wipe effect. If the game doesnt last until a nd board wipe is seen then I either had a dope draw nobody was ready for how raw Ghave is or both.,EDH,d6vgpdn,1,t5_2scee

8732857,0,t3_4znhok,A few years back I had a Sharuum the Hegemon list which eventually came apart due to lack of interest. This is my attempt to rebuild it in a more casual janky style. The approach is extremely straightforward dropping Muzzio and getting a bunch of artifacts into play my record so far being six in a turn thanks to Illusionists Bracers Sculpting Steel as a copy of the bracers Blightsteel Colossus letting me dig  cards deep each time and ThousandYear Elixir to untap and reactivate Muzzio on the cheap. My main concerns at the moment I might need more beatsticks. In the last game I played Wormcoil Engine Darksteel Colossus and Blightsteel Colossus were all exiled leaving me to gradually win the game via slow slow Inkwell Leviathan damage. Any suggestions for beefy artifact beaters I may have missed? Counterspell package is a little weak but I dont want to detract too much from the artifact theme to beef it up too much. I am not sure Im running enough mana rocks as the deck is pretty slow for the first  turns or so while I set up a board state. Id like to be faster out of the gate since I know midtolate game the deck makes absurd amounts of mana Phyrexian Metamorph copying Caged Sun with ten Islands on the board is lulz and Id prefer to get there quicker so I can drop a  artifact from my hand and start really digging with Muzzios ability.Please check it out and let me know what you think whether you have any good ideas to fix the above issues etc. Much appreciated!,EDH,d6x94pt,2,t5_2scee

Youll have equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine Sword of Fire and Ice and Worldslayer. Youll have boardwipes like Wrath of God and Day of Judgement since Zurgo is indestructible when youre casting them. Youll want cards like Armageddon to destroy all lands Cuz once you have Zurgo out you dont care about mana.

Every counterspell targeted discard mill or even killspell could turn the entire tide of the game into my favor and every time I milled the Mayael player everybody winced.

8887702,0,t1_d7g57w6,gtThese things have a defined meaning. The its all just semantics handwave is a copout that basically says who cares about trying to think about EDH in a logical and ordered fashion.I dont agree that it has a defined meaning. In constructed Tier  means the top level of decks. Tier . or Tier  means decks that can still win tournaments but just dont do it consistently. So if you were to apply the definition to EDH then you would be correct. But a big difference between the EDH community and constructed communities is that the percentage of people that play competitively is wildly off. In standardmodern... its somewhere between  that are aware of what the good decks are and play the format competitively at some level even if its just going to FNMs and top ing every now and then. But for EDH its almost certainly under . So if you were to ask someone what they consider tier  and tier . and tier  they might have a different scale because they never play against the very top level decks. Thats why I give him a pass on the Tier .. And on top of this this article is posted in the EDH subreddit and not the competitive EDH subreddit. No other other part of the article mentions that this is intended to be a finely tuned list that can compete with the best decks out there. I agree with you that the deck has issues and had this article been posted on the competitive edh subreddit then obviously you have to be much more critical. But its a solid deck. They probably went a little too far with the dragon subtheme for my taste. ,EDH,d7g6co0,1,t5_2scee

8920463,0,t1_d7k311b,Its definitely technically true. The game never advances phases or steps until all players have passed on an empty stack. So after Nekusar resolves all players get priority before Declare Blockers begins. The player whose turn it is gets priority first and it proceeds through the other players in turn order.So the way it works here is that were in Declare Attackers and Grimgrin has been declared as an attacker. Grimgrin player passes priority and the Nekusar player casts Nekusar. Nekusar resolves. Then the Grimgrin player the active player that is gets priority. They can then use their Grave Pact as they describe. Once that resolves the Grimgrin player gets priority again and presumably passes. If all opponents also pass then they go to Declare Blockers.Your planeswalker example is not the same situation. ,EDH,d7k3xt0,3,t5_2scee

If I ramp ahead and can land him on two with like sol ring then as early as possible if I have follow up.  Generally however I try to cast him when I can set up value even if he dies which is typically  or  so that you can have tokens already and set up a draw spell for  or .    Id for sure add command beacon over a mountain and probably cut both pairs of boots for draw spells Ive also never been a fan of uncaged fury in the list it feels like it cost too much mana.

At a competitive pod everybody will know to kill the LeoJhoiraKaalia player or the game is just over. Either you will have zero fun or your opponents will have zero fun. No matter what somebody doesnt get to play the game. Leo decks popped up within about  weeks of each other at my LGS and the guy who got his built first was lucky. He got precisely one game in where he PuzzleLocked us and then in every other game after that he didnt survive past turn five. Afterwards we all knew just how strong he would be and a Leovold deck hasnt won at our store since.By all means build him.

We have Sedris but thats a  CMC bomb and another  for the first reanimation which makes it . This should be used as a last resort ditch and not as a main plan since its way too expensive.Ravings Nah I think it doesnt make the cut. There are better options if we want to draw that are still budget.Veil doesnt seem worth it either in my opinion. Its a defensive card that often doesnt do anything.Exhume is an option but again we dont have that great reanimation targets and its symetric so in my experience its not worth running anywhere.I think I might need to add Mogg Fanatic since we dont have a great finisher for infinite mana outlets. Could be anything else that works as well Spikeshot Elder any X spells Master Yamabushi... there are many MANY options for this.As for the blue primordial... again I think its just too low reward for the risk.

The majority of the group myself included were involved in a pretty typical arms race as I feel most EDH groups go through but  players were not interested in changing their decks with the evolving metagame. They got more and more vocal about it and eventually both of them ended up rage quitting a game because they didnt have an answer to a hardcast Tidespout Tyrant. After that we filled  binders with various forms of removal in all  colours and gave one to each of them. They both put some more removal in their decks and all was well.

Atleast Hug decks are meant to be that way imo.HahahahahahahahahaAll group hug decks do is elevate power discrepancies. You can take three decks that are normally relatively even but the moment you throw a group hug deck into the mix suddenly whoevers deck is a little more tuned than the rest is going to run away with the game immediately. On top of that group hug completely eliminates the normal dynamics of a game. You cant rely on things like curve anymore you cant make plans and have a tight game. And on top of that is the asshole group hug player ruining the game for everyone else sitting there like Whats the matter? Im just giving you guys cards and ramp! Its a fucking toxic kind of deck that isnt fun for anyone but the asshole playing it.Chaos is even worse because it literally just throws out the whole game for the sake of random luls.

As for the buildaround I feel like its a nonissue for three reasons One neither half so far is really powerful enough to warrant a deck revolving solely around them anyways. Two they functionally act as two halves of one big commander so its not really any different from running one big buildaround commander. Three tutors exist whether people discourage them or not so its entirely possible to build around as many cards as you want already.I look forward to the chance to come up with interesting deck themes by mixing and matching outside of the prepackaged pairs.

As long as you have at least  life more than your starting life total  has flying vigilance and first strike.The idea was to have a commander who could turn mass damage spells into mass heal spells as well and then take advantage of many of the lifegain cards that are generally only used in BW decks like Ayli and Karlov. And then the commander herself would still be a solid beater in the event you hit  life and suit her up with Sunforger or something. I figured the cost and effects would be fairly balanced based off of precedents set by Ayli and Soulfire Grandmaster although maybe the double strike is going a little bit far as she could then gaining life faster than the opponents at a noncompetitive table can deal with it...

If you start getting scary tell the other players that its insurance. Single out one player and subtly mention You know that guys board has the ability to go from  to  real quick. We should figure out how to prevent that. Playing politics and playing cards that assist the entire table or even better helping out yourself and one other person at the table with enchantments and the like gives you allies. When you have a card that hangs out and specifically helps one other person that person is likely to come to your aid when other people dont like that card.  One person is playing Gisa Ghoulcaller tokens and another is playing Voltron Uril the Miststalker? Casually throw down Silent Arbiter claiming its for your own protection against the Gisa. Voltron will love the advantage it benefits you and the Gisa player is going to make an enemy of you.

9529358,0,t3_5barhe,From my experience at GPS over the last few years First there are varying rules based on whos running the gp as to how prize is distributed in games. Some of them are basically bounty kills  packs others tell you to give a pack to whoever killed you and another to anyone else at the table when you die maybe someone who you thought had the coolest deck or was the most enjoyable. Neither of these are really great systems but most of the time if noone else knows each other at the table it usually ends up being pretty fair. Noone in those games in my experience really comes gunning for prize and the power level is reasonable.However and I will admit to have done this in these formats there are plenty of people who sign up with  friends especially if completely boxing out the other players from prize made it worthwhile. Its not the most honest way of winning a prize but its not against the rules and Id suggest trying to get an idea if there is a chance of running into people doing that first because it will save you from just getting targeted out of games. People who group up in these tournaments generally run somewhat better decks and are there to farm prizes not have fun but when Ive entered with friends to farm prize we generally try to make the game enjoyable and relatively fair while still ensuring a profit.The third type Ive run into only at state level magic tournaments is a straight up v format usually with pretty good prize and  entry. In my experience since you know that everyone is walking in on a team no holds are barred expect  turn games and to face the best decks people have. I generally dont have fun with these so I stay away.,EDH,d9np08h,4,t5_2scee

9584904,0,t3_5c4cb6,The old rule of thumb was to start with  then subtract one for every two pieces of ramp. I still more or less follow this and dont generally have trouble. As far as amount of ramp it depends on the deck.My Jor Kadeen deck has  mana rocks and  artifact mana dorks to turn on metalcraft and offset RWs lack of landbased ramp with only  lands.My Edric deck has a curve of . and thus only has a few mana dorks and  lands.My Avacyn Angel of Hope deck which while it doesnt have a high curve has an expensive commander isnt a good color for ramping but is monocolored. As such it has  lands all three mana doublers and only rocks that tap for a lot such as Gilded Lotus and Thran Dynamo. Same logic goes for Tromokratis.My Borborygmos Enraged deck wants a lot of lands to throw at people and also has an expensive commander so Ive got  lands and  rampland search effects.My Nekusar deck wheels constantly and so likes cheap mana rocks to throw out and use on the same turn such as the Talismans and signets with  lands.My Sasaya deck wants a bunch of lands in hand to flip her so the deck is  lands with  rampland search effects.My Uril deck is designed to get him out and killing people as fast as possible before they can prepare for him and runs mass land destruction so there are no land ramp effects and no ramp that costs more than   ramp effects in total  land. I could probably cut that land count down but I dont really play the deck that often so I havent bothered.As you can see theres different reasoning based on how the deck plays. For a nonred commander youre in green and will need to find four different colors so the usual Kodamas ReachCultivateRampant GrowthFarseek will be really useful as well as signets or talismans to filter into your colors. With all those youll probably be good running a slightly lower number of lands.,EDH,d9uj9pf,1,t5_2scee

For alternating between go wide and go tall decks you might want to check out some Thromok decks. Spells with convoke sprout swarm work well with tokens and cryptolith rite basically gives everything convoke. You can use fungal sprouting to switch from tall to wide.

As I went about doing this I remembered an opponent had a Stony Silence on the field preventing me from using the Elixir. So I thought no problem Ill just deal with it and be on my way.

9775794,0,t1_dahwu50,The mention of scaling here is very important. People get so fucking hung up on  apparently only meaning Oh they THINK they can play at both ultra casual AND hyper competitive tables  when thats not the point at all.The point is and always has been being able to scale a decks power to match the general optimization level of a playgroup. A  deck will extremely rarely if ever win at a table with Zur Stax and Yisan and the like similarly it will have a hard time NOT winning against several casual decks of draft chaff or Kithkin tribal or something. However both of these extremes are outliers.

9776366,0,t3_5f7wvc,Some options I would recommend are  Burnished Hart because land in monowhite is never a bad thing. Puresteel Paladin because Equipments make card draw once again very good for monowhite.Oreskos Explorer if you play in  man pods. A well timed play means some nice land fetch.Minds Eye is another option for card drawPearl Medallion will help you get your keyword soup onto the field a bit faster.Things I would drop are Fabled Hero because unless Im mistaken the only spell you have that can target it at all is Shielded by Faith. Everything else is activated abilities or such. You wont get any value from it.Karoo because its too slow  not only does it return a card to your hand If you play it early you may very well have  uncastable cards in hand and have to discard it also comes in tapped. Its better to have a normal land drop. Besides that it can just be removed and youll have lost the equivalent of two lands.Seraph of Dawn The Sungrace Pegasus has the same keyword value at half the mana cost. Probably better to lose a small amount of redundancy for the sake of a different form of value like plains fetching in the Oreskos Explorers.All in all its looking fine.

9831585,0,t1_daogsd1,Whilst I completely understand where youre coming from theres one big thing I want to say So as to be able to even BEGIN brewing you have to have some kind of general comprehension of what cards EXIST in MTG which could be benefitial. Maybe if youve played the game since it was first released you know most of these but if youve ever seen a standard player trying to make their first EDH deck going in blind its going to be absolutely terrible. Reading up on primers and getting a general feel for what cards are used in the format in what decks and for what reason is a very smart and efficient way to learn how to build your own deck.You literally cannot make a homebrew if you dont know how to make a deck or what cards you could usewould synergise with your strategy. If you have a huge collection at home and just want to sift through that everytime you make a deck then cool and if thats what works for you I wont critisize that.However I think indicating that primers arent beneficial to janky homebrews is a wrong way to look at it imo. You have to get your inspiration from somewhere and good primers are definately a solid place to start.,EDH,dap2s9d,3,t5_2scee

10005606,0,t1_dbbqtss,A few mana dorks are probably the most important given your current curve. You probably want six  or  CMC dorks at the minimum. The two Eldrazi lands are a simple addition for two forests which is a low cost. Crop Rotation is a solid addition with those lands as you can quickly find any land you need most especially Gaeas Cradle.If you wanted the Eldrazi package youd have to trade that for the Hydras you have but thats entirely up to your preference. I know the Eldrazi can be a bit hateful especially with annihilator.Some cuts I would personally make first areVerdurous Gearhulk  Thunderfoot Baloth  Omnath Locus of Mana  Nylea God of the Hunt  Karametras Acolyte  Caged Sun  Sword of the Paruns  Selvalas Stampede  Asceticism  Zendikar Resurgent  Defense of the Heart  Helix Pinnacle  The changes you make should be based on your playgroup. If you play mostly multiplayer then it may be good to leave a higher curve so youre not ramping too quickly and therefore paint yourself as a target. If you play a lot of v not CEDH but just casual v then some additional ramp would be more beneficial.But just remember this is your deck and you can make it however you like.

10007350,0,t3_5iwuv8,Meren can only reanimate one creature a turn. You dont want a lot of stuff in your yard as it opens you up to blowouts from grave hate. I would cut the dredge package. The most efficient way to win with Meren is repeatedly recurring Gray Merchant or Kokusho ideally with Mikaeus out. Winning with combat damage requires committing a bunch of cards to the board which turns board wipes into blowouts and risks exile effects. Meren is a widelyloathed general and winning with her means not giving your opponents a chance to fuck you over.Youre gonna want a Merciless Executioner and a Slum Reaper to go with that Fleshbag  the group sac effect is your strongest weapon by far. Id also recommend Yavimaya Elder Farhaven Elf Wood Elves all of which pod into either Solemn or the Slum Reaper. Its not nice but Mindslicer is ludicrously effective in Meren. You can play out of your yard so who needs a hand?Sylvan Safekeeper and Lightning Greaves are pretty much mandatory for keeping Meren on the board as she is a prime target for removal.Pawn of Ulamog and Sifter of Skulls give you sac fodder and mana.,EDH,dbbzil7,3,t5_2scee

The deck wants to make as many servos and thopters as possible in conjunction with etbs  panharmonicon and flicker effects to recur the etbs creating an army of metal s.The list has undergone some changes  I just havent gotten around to adding them all yet. There are about  tutors in my list Enlightened Fabricate Demonic Diabolic Intent and my first tutor target every game is panharmonicon. Then the plan is to get protection for it via Padeem Hexproof or Indestructibility Darksteel Forge. After we are set up  there are a few cards that can copy panharmonicon and then things get really crazy Scultpting Steel Phyrexian Metamorph. If our panharmonicon gets blown up goblin welder daretti and scrap mastery are all easy ways to recur. Let me know what you think ,EDH,dc53dt5,1,t5_2scee

They bother enter at  both have a plus to look at the top of your deck and both assist in superfriends and counter based decks. So whats tyhe differencementor of heroes costs  generic less IMHO this is nothing in EDHUnyielding enters with  loyalty after using a plus on each of them when they enter.Unyielding has protection with his minus Mentor has none if you dont have a creature to pump or get one from your search.Mentors search is more restrictive and only digs one card deeper Unyielding will retrieve Creatures Artifacts Enchantments and Walkers and isnt limited to picking just one.Of both ultimate I feel Unyielding CAN be more of an impact if your board is set up BUT Mentor can be used as long as you can gain life.All in all I think I will be replacing my Mentor with Unyielding,EDH,dc5gd2a,1,t5_2scee

10257797,0,t1_dc6ra2c,Graveyard hate will always stand in the way of decks that abuse the graveyard and thats fine. Its the ability to power past that and to have answers to stax effects that make your deck more competitive. They have stopped us from going off early in the game but were also in the colours to power through into the midgame.This is also why I like Saffi a lot in comparison to dedicated graveyard decks. Decks that depend on having a full graveyard suddenly have a good percentage of their cards disappear forever with grave exile effects. GWs focus should not be on filling your graveyard but it should simply function as another zone to pass through fleetingly while we combo off. That said we have the flexibility to use our yard as a second hand too if need be.Saffi itself is a difficult card to deal with. Its no bother to simply put her in the graveyard should she experience a Lignify effect. And if shes exiled from the graveyard shes cheap enough to recast during your next turn with little annoyance.Now with a redundancy of cards that work with her and the number of sac outlets we have access to I say its a good time to revisit her again. ,EDH,dc6s07y,10,t5_2scee

Otherwise youll never be able to cast all of these spells and late game you can Fork them to still get value. Farseek Rampant Growth Explore SakuraTribe Elder Natures Lore Cultivate Kodamans Reach Explosive Vegetation Tempt with Discovery and Skyshroud Claim are some of the ramp you should run. Thats not an end all be all list thats just what I tend to use in my Ramp decks. How much would need to be playested  I would run all of those  cost cards some of the  and maybe one or two of the  CMCs. Switch out a lot of the bad lands you have there for basics with a green lean to be able to cast your early game ramp.For a bunch of cards that run off a multiple copies  win theme Im surprised you dont have a Progenitor Mimic.,EDH,dcgudon,2,t5_2scee

Library is fucking insane.That said the only one I REALLY disagree with is Prophet of Kruphix. That was such an unnecessary ban.

Incredibly good in more competitive games where your actions really matter and the ability to take extra actions really vault you ahead. In casual games not so much I guess. I guess many of the posters in this thread havent played in games where limited resources start to mater very early on.

10385223,0,t3_5oq2vc,ah but there are so many great commanders out there! you just have yet to catch a building stride. Im admittedly a combo player but your group doesnt like fastcombo where the deck plays little protection and drives around  combos that win the game asap. Prossh is great example of this an unassuming commander without combos that does neat things but once the player gets Food Chain in there just for a wincon the deck evolves to cut fat and make that combo happen faster and faster.monoU combo decks always feel a little linear to me. You seem to have tried staxcontrol and some midrange stuff with Wort. for that matter I think Wort is amazing as a spellslinger so you might revisit that idea and make it faster.Other than voltron Id suggest looking into other explosive aggro strategies or wide combo decks. explosive aggro would be something like noncombo Riku ending on AvengerCraterhoof swings or Maelstrom Wanderer with some chaos in there. RUG is good for that and can always have the inevitability of a combo win. for less linear combo decks I think MarathGhave is a fantastic deck to build and play at any level. My first color deck was when Ghave was spoiled Ive loved it since. Marath supports a more aggro strategy with some combo ending potential its also a very easy deck to play around with slots over time.  Id still play the  white tutors for Cathars Crusade Earthcraft Mana Flare Ashnods Altar etc. Id still play  green tutors for Ivy Lane Denizen maybe for setting up Reveillark Loops if you wanted to play a recursion game.last idea for widecombo would be Alesha. shes a superfun graveyardbased comboaggro build. burying and reanimating is a fun playstyle maybe youll teach your group more graveyard hate. she can run Reveillark  friends recursion loops for win. She can also do that with KikiJiki.,EDH,dcl89n2,1,t5_2scee

10408453,0,t3_5p1p57,First I would upgrade the mana base.  color decks thrive on being able to play the game and that is significantly more true for Slivers because you are playing an aggressive deck in which you are killing them through mostly combat damage.Budgetwise I would cut the Panoramas complete the Arcane Sanctum cycle of lands  Frontier Bivouac from Khans of Tarkir. Check out Ravnica Karoo lands Grull Turf Life Taplands Blossoming Sands and the Guildgates Boros Guildgate that are all under  each most you can probably just ask for because there are a ton of these lands out there.You might want to look into the Ravnica Signets if you want to ramp and color fix at the same time such as Rakdos Signet.The next step up would be the Scrylands Temple of Abandon then Battle Lands Cinder Glade and Shadow Lands Game Trail which are all a few dollars and that should be a pretty good start on the mana base.Now for the nonlands I would get rid of a couple of the board wipes you are playing a creature based deck and you cant always guarantee Hivelord will be out. Get rid of Levitation and find a Galerider Sliver its the second Sliver you can get to give all of yours flying. Steel of the Godhead should probably go if you really want unblockable find a Rogues Passage. I would get rid of Packs Disdain and find a Swords to Plowshares it will go in almost every single white deck you make and is amazing removal. Manaweft Sliver is like a second slightly better Gemhide Sliver I would probably run both.Finally I would get a finisher for the deck. Magma Sliver is a great way for finishing with Slivers or just making combat tricky. Overwhelming Stampede can overrun the table as can Triumph of the Hordes especially with Virulent Sliver lending a hand. After a few swings Beastmaster Ascension can make your army massive until its dealt with. Cathars Crusade makes every Sliver into a powerful pump spell. Getting to the more expensive stuff Kamahl Fist of Krosa can constantly Overrun Elesh Norn Grand Cenobite grows your army and shrinks theirs which be warned usually makes you a massive target and Craterhoof Behemoth is the best at what it does.You have a pretty solid start to the deck already the main weakness I see right now is the mana base I would shoot for  of each basic with more of the ones you use more of and build up with what I suggested based on your budget.,EDH,dcnv6ni,1,t5_2scee

10434320,0,t1_dcql4kq,gtBut fuck BreyaYou did me a sad. Shes my goto. Sydri is awesome though so Im not salted. Ill give you some fun Artifacts advice from a fellow budget Artifacts player who appreciates a good combo without having to break the game or your wallet. Have you considered Thopter Foundry? It works well with Ironworks and gives you life and a token. It also has a sick combo with Sword of the Meek which goes well in any WUB artifacts deck with Thopter Tokens. Sword of the Meek is a bit above the  budget sitting at  but you have Ironworks which is at  the same price mark so I dont really see it as overlyexpensive given your limit. Theres also Thopter Assembly which kinda meets your  budget that can be fun. It gives you  Thopters if there arent any Thopters on the field and can combo nicely. You seem to like tokens and artifacts so it fits the bill.  Also Ashnods Altar is great for that kind of tokencombo deck and you can get some mana. With Breya alone you dont like her but shes the example Im using its possible to get all of these to go infinite but with Sydri you can get the benefits while not having to break the game with infinite combos. Add in Myr Battlesphere for a fun card. Nim Deathmantle can go nicely with Battlesphere plus Ironworks or Altar so you could get infinite tokens and mana if you play them right. Those with Thopter Foundry are particularly bonkers.  Or you could just add Mry Battlesphere for fun because its a fun card and have Ashnods Altar to help with mana if need be and have Nim Deathmantle to help get more tokens and mana without necessarily having to abuse the combo to go infinite. Thopter Foundry really helps with life and gives you a token even if comboinfinite isnt your cup of tea. Given Sydris abilities I think all of these cards could fit nicely in your deck even if youre not a fan of infinite combos and just want a fun game. All or at least most of these should be under . ,EDH,dcqst3t,2,t5_2scee

I like swinging with big blue creatures and AER added in a wicked new whale to play with. The deck has a couple outs  st being Mechanized production and the sources in the deck like clues thopters constructs copied artifact creatures and pests being used to try and hit the win condition.  Out  is a kind of board lock with Archetype of aggresion and Stormtide Leviathon.  Its got a decent slew of counters and copys but just doesnt seem to get rolling quick and in a big game I fear itll get shut down before it starts rolling or will get a  con setup  turn too late.  Within reason financially are there any themed reccomendations to help speed this ocean dwelling deck up!? inventors Fair is an absolute must as well for this deck and is on my to acquire list.,EDH,dcx6xdz,1,t5_2scee

10600332,0,t1_dd953bx,So lets dive deeper into my comparison between Zur and Leovold since they are both extremely similar decks and we both agree that Zur is tier .First here is the Zur list that is on the community info. I know that different people run different lists but this should be a good place to base from because it is what is publicly given as a good Zur list.First lets look at White vs Green. This Zur list only runs  white cards in the main. I am not counting white rocks or lands since you could easily run the green versions of those cards.SilenceSwordsPull from eternityAngles graceGrasp of fateOblivion ringOf these  of them are removal spells which could easily be replaced with the many good blue or black removal spells.The other  are good utilty spells but none are required to make the deck work. Overall the only thing white gives you that actually has a significant impact on how the deck plays is Angles Grace since it allows you to Ad Nauseum combo even if you are low life. This is important but not game breakingly so.This means that you could literally run  out the same  in Leovold and find good replacements for the other . On top of that there are plenty of good cards in green like better ramp that easily cover the loss of white. My point in all of this is to say that the difference between the colors of the decks can mostly be ignored because the vast majority of the cards in the deck are in the shared colors of blue and black.This means that the discussion can now focus solely on a direct comparison between Leovold and Zur themselves. First lets look at what Zur gives you. The list I am working from only runs  enchantments.Grasp of fateOblivion RingPower artifactNecropotenceThis means that what Zur gives you as a commander  is removal the ability to use power artifact combos and most importantly a very strong source of card draw. You also get a  flying creature.These things are very powerfull and are what make Zur stronger than any of the other Esper commanders but now lets look at Leovold.First Leovold has the Draw prevention. This is clearly the strongest thing about him. This ability allows him to use a wheel of which this Zur list runs several to wipe your opponents hands as well as lock with puzzle box. Even if you are not using him to wheel just the persistant draw restriction is a large thorn in the side of most other decks.His second ability that allows you to draw when people target you is also very good. In my experience it most often just draws you one card when they kill Leovold but that is because it prevents people from targeting you at all. People are less likely to cast removal on you if they know it is going to draw you a card. Overall Leovold is extremely powerfull and has a very large impact on the game but I have to admit that if you look at it from just that Zur does more. The problem with that logic though is that Zur also costs  more mana and takes longer to impact the board.First Zur costing  more mana is extremely relavent. Because it means that it is much harder to cast early in the game. Combine that with the fact that Leovold has the Green Mana dorks and together it means Leovold is much much more often able to come dow n on turn . Zur can be cast on turn  sometimes but many times you cant play him until turn . Not only does Zur come down a turn later he doesnt do anything until he swings. Leovold starts disrupting your opponents as soon as he hits the field and if they kill him you get to draw a card where as in Zur you dont.  We could keep going and get into even more fine detail but my point is that if you wanted to you could take this Zur list and port the vast majority of it strait to Leovold.All of this said I do not think you should actually do a direct port like that. That would be stupid as this deck is designed for Zur and not Leovold. But you could easily port a large part of the list while also making changes to make the deck suit Leovold rather than Zur. This will mean that the decks are the same archetype but  is tailored to Zur and the other to Leovold. You would end up with  very similar decks that play to their own strengths. Now all of this leads up to my list. I am still tuning it a little but it is still an Ad Nauseum storm deck like Zur. I am not running Doomsday but I am running lab mantainted pact or demonic consultation which is very similar.Overall my deck is a lot different than the Zur list but that is because it plays better to the strength of Leovold. I dont have time to get too into detail but my Leovold list is easily as strong as the Zur list I have been basing this on. ,EDH,dd9cd05,1,t5_2scee

Get real mean by stacking their hand with Head Games and follow it up with a Worst Fears.

10658074,0,t3_5sfq6g,One thing that really influences how ok it is has to be the power level of your meta. I play in a hypercompetitive meta where a  deck is often budget if you want all real cards. This means that for many people if they cant proxy they cant compete because they just cannot afford the high barrier to entry. For this reason proxies are just fine. We would rather everyone be able to enjoy playing the game rather than just those who can afford it. The main rule is that your proxies must be decent. No lands with sharpie on them.Personally I would reccomend every playgroup allow whatever proxies but that is because I think playing with high powered cards is fun.Lastly even if you are playing more casually I strongly believe mana bases should be allowed to be  proxied. Allowing people to proxy a proper fetch dual  does not make their deck oppressive. It is not fun when people cant play the game because their basic land manabase never gives them all of their colors.,EDH,ddfarpm,1,t5_2scee

Everything about that card seems great until you want to do something with your deck that doesnt have room for a rather narrow range of instants. I can see it being bonkers in a Naya Bant or Jeskai decks where that third colour opens up a lot of options but Boros is lacking.It gets brought up as an autoinclude in Boros constantly but is a big mana investment for rarely a satisfying payoff. At least in my Brion Stoutarm and Archangel Avacyn decks.

Even if you cant afford a fancy manabase simply including things like Command TowerSphere Fellwar Stone and the relevant triland in an otherwise straight BR deck seems better than just running VS solo.

I think Id take those out and replace them with maybe Swiftfoot Boots or Lightning Greaves since you dont seem to have much protection for Rakdos Lord of Riots.Mindsparker is a strange card to have unless your meta runs lots of W and U? Butcher of Malakir could be replaced with either Dictate of Erebos or Grave Pact which do the same thing but arent as fragile as a creature again up to your meta if theres lots of enchantment removal. Lastly I noticed youre running Kaervek the Merciless in your .

If you are playing a lowerpowered enough deck that you cant win until turn    even  pieces of removaldisruption targeted at Boonweaver Karador is not going to level the playing field because these decks are resilient efficient and packed with tutors. Your disruptive hand looks good until they tutor Mindslicer and discard all that stuff and then win now what?

11152980,0,t3_5z62el,Nonbasic land hate against a WUB deck you say? How does Blood Moon sound? You could do a number on his deck. As a Breya combo player much of what people have mentioned does actually do a number on Artifact decks. I also noticed you have Food Chain. How does Purphoros and Impact Tremors sound to you? Throw in some token producers and you can do some damage unrelated to Food Chain just adding this bit for the sake of encouraging some ETB token abuse. You could also try Yidris and get some Black spells in there. Obliterate is a crazy red spell that would technically get the job done for you but its pretty chaotic. Maybe you could focus on wraths and countermagic a bit more to stop Sharuum. Including Artifact hate is perfect for this. Again a lot of what I was going to say has been said.

Ive recieved tons of great feedback but could use some more help finalizing the list. This is the first commander deck Ive ever put together myself so please let me know what the deck needs. I tried to keep it near . Our playgroup mainly runs slightly altered C decks so this doesnt need to be oppressively powerful. That said this deck is a gift and I want it to feel strong for the budget Im working with. My main concerns are a. should I include more countermagic or removal? and b. does the deck have enough ways of filling the graveyard for later recursion?I also removed all creatures which arent zombies for budgetary and other synergistic concerns.

Unless youre comparing it to Mana Vault or something Sol Ring is on another level compared to your standard mana rocks. It comes down  turns earlier and makes more mana. It makes more than it costs which puts it in a pretty premier group of mana rocks.

11257358,0,t3_60lzto,Hey so Kaalia is my first ever EDH deck and Ive been refining and tuning her for a  type playgroup. Ive kept out Iona and Master of cruelties as the meanest things Kaalia can drop just so the games are a bit more interactive.My deck runs two main themes of reanimation and haste. Cards like Anger Flamekin Village and the classic Lightning Greaves make sure that you wont have to wait another round at the table before Kaalia can drop something. Reanimator cards such as Torrent of Souls and Grave Upheaval get around the fact that Kaalia will always be the tables  priority to remove. I always pitch Kaalia to the yard when she dies except maybe the first recast  cmc and use reanimator effects to get her back efficiently. These reanimator and haste effects do doubleduty when the table just wants to kill anything and everything on your board. At that point just reanimate one of your big beatsticks and try to give it haste if you have nothing in hand to drop with Kaalia. Try running some noncompetitive tutors like Diabolic tutor and Beseech The Queen to get your protection out asap.As for your DemonsDragonsAngels just try to communicate to your playgroup that youre not running anything degenerate like Master of Cruelties or Iona Shield of Emeria. Some of my favourites include Aurelia the Warleader even if she doesnt trigger the first time she ETBs its still good value Gisela Blade of Goldnight RuneScarred Demon and Steel Hellkite. My rule of thumb is just to try and make sure your beaters are always interactive. Cards that lock down opponents are typically the least fun to play against and are usually the biggest source of ire at Kaalia players. ,EDH,df806b0,1,t5_2scee

Essentially you mana ramp into oblivion use a lot of recursion either to bring back Polukranos after he kills himself or cycle stuff like Acidic Slime and kill most of your opponents creatures with a deathtouch Polukranos monstrosity.Using Nightshade Peddler Basilisk Collar Quietus Spike and Sword of Kaldra on Polu turns him into a boardwipe on a stick since you only have to hit a creature once to kill it. Murder everything on one players board and then  or  shot them with commander damage if Polu lives. There are a lot of ETB effects too so naturally I run Conjurors Closet. The decks plan B is cycling Terrastadon or Acidic Slime to kill lands or swinging in with a massive Worldspine Wurm or Ulvenwald Hydra with Rogues Passage.

Well you might have a Krosan Grip or Beast Within but not likely. If you do you use it if not no big. You draw enough cards to keep playing things but not enough that youre digging through your whole deck every game. Plus you still get to do some weird synergies Bow of Nylea and Polukranos makes for some complicated removal. Jotun and Mirri mean that you can sometimes give away a forest with Yavimaya Dryad and feel good. Plus one thing that is great is you may not get a new card every set but there will be more green and colorless legends going forward and you can mix it up as time goes on.

11280560,0,t3_60zd54,I have a Kruphix EDH deck and I can agree that it is one of the most fun commanders to play with. Our builds are slightly different so feel free to disagree with my suggestions.New cards that Kruphix can benefit from includeRashmi Eternities Crafter especially when youre playing big spellsWildest Dreams is great for bringing back cards from the graveyard something I find Kruphix struggled withKydele Chosen of Kruphix is a card that can ramp you into a ton of mana if youre heavy on card draw. Personally I thought she was a bit overkill in my build.Emrakul the Promised End is a nice way to disrupt somebody and isnt that hard to cast for its initial decreased mana cost in a Kruphix deck. is a bit priceyEndbringer is great card draw in multiplayer games if you have excess mana.Ulvenwald Hydra can fetch any land and become huge in a mana ramp deck like this.Other cards that fit nice in the deck areChord of Calling to tutor up a nice big fatty especially at opponents end step but is priceyPsychosis Crawler is great with big draw spells and instantly wins with Enter the Infinite usuallyArchetype of Imagination gives your creatures pseudounblockableCryptolith Rite turns all your guys into mana dorksWhat to remove? Personally Im not a fan of counterspells in this deck but Ive been disagreed with on this. So I would cut Counterspell and Disdainful Stroke. I would add Plasma Capture in just because it can counter but also gets you the mana you want.Because youre not playing many Eldrazi or Artifact creatures I would cut Conduit of Ruin as it only fetches you two cards in your deck. I would also cut Woodland Bellower as I dont think you get much value for that.

Games are not perfect though and you may want to get him out first if you get the chance and combo off in the next couple turns.Ive played a lot of Mikaeus.

In the games that I played I had the same problem finishing games but found that with planeawalkers you can out value opponents while you draw a bunch of cards off monarch. If you can keep the opponent on their back feet with board wipe and land wipe after each other all while refueling from monarch youll eventually exhaust their answers. Also I like grand abolisher as mentioned but Im probably going an even meaner route with price of glory to really stick it to blue players even though I am one at heart lol.

11370233,0,t3_627540,Please note  I didnt look at your list as Tappedout is blocked at work so this is just a general this is the formula for a solid firstdraft of a deck than something tailored just for you. Ive posted this recipe many times on rEDH for people with similar issues.Deckbuilding process in a nutshell.Pick  or  WAYS to win. This is like Worldgorger combo or Food Chain combo its a method not a specific  cards.Now find ALL the cards that are efficient at letting you accomplish that win. For the Worldgorger example obviously Worldgorger is a mandatory part of it but what about the reanimation spell? Theres  or  that work so those go in. What about the thing that actually kills everybody when you go off? Id include  or  of these as well. Now you have  cards that all feed the same combo with Worldgorger.Do this for your  or  wincons. This means you have a goal with redundancy.Now you want to find a few ways to get to each combo. Tutors entombs etc. In total your goal is to have  cards that either DO each part of your combo andor gets each part of the combo.  tutor can count as oneeighth of multiple combos if it can get multiple things demonic tutor for example would count as th of each part of every combo. Worldly Tutor would only count towards getting Worldgorger or other creatures involved in your combo.If you dont have  ways to do a thing youre deck is not that thing. Maelstrom Wanderer is a great example of this. Food Chain is amazing in the deck but theres a whopping  tutor thats even remotely good to get Food Chain so its not a Food Chain deck its a deck that just happens to include Food Chain.Now you start at  lands. For every  spells that ramp dorks mana rocks ramp spells etc cut  land. For every  draw spells not tutors cut  land.Fill the rest in with  counter spells probably  board wipes and  INSTANT speed removal spells. This gives you ways to interact with as much as possible. If you arent running blue those  counter spells should be  cards that preemptively hose a strategy Rule of Law Rest in Peace Aven Mindcensor etc since you cant interact with spells on that stack you need to stop those spells from working in the first place.This is now your baseline thrown together deck and you can adjust those baseline values as needed. If youre deck has a low curve reduce your land count. If you find yourself getting shut down too often up the counterstax count. If youre always the person at the table with the biggest board state run fewer board wipes. You get the idea.,EDH,dfkslrm,3,t5_2scee

11418010,0,t3_62w4e5,Im no expertcompetetive spike genius but it seems like a pretty decent deck. Youve got some very powerful creatures and your aggressive combat approach seems good but you are also running enough counters and stuff that it seems like you want to go for a control shell. I dont think you need more tutors because your best effects are mostly creatures which  Azorius doesnt really tutor for. I think you need a few more ways to set other people back so you can piece together your voltron attacks and big board states.I think youre feeling a lack of ramp because you want to be dropping bomb creatures and effects for voltron but still be leaving mana open for counter spells and stuff which might set you back in tempo.What I might do is replace a couple of the mediocre equipments with a few more bounce spells. Snap is nice because its sort of free. Aetherspouts could probably help you regain some tempo. Boardwipes could be great if you were cautious about when you used them but I dont think you need a bunch. You have swords to plowshares maybe get rapid hybridization as well and just other instant speed ways to set people back for not much mana.It seems like the type of deck that authority of the consul could be good in. Paired with arcgangel of thune that could be brutal!Maybe also adding some cheap defensive cards like void winnower fog bank or guard gomazoa might work to buy you time for setting up some of your bigger plays although thats maybe just a personal preference of mine.As far as more ramp you dont have a signet and maybe having a few more rocks could be good but youre curve isnt ridiculously high or anything so it doesnt seem too important.Also deprive isnt a very good counterspell. Counterspell or swan song would be better. Actually there are a few better counters than what youre running.Good luck,EDH,dfq7x41,2,t5_2scee

The Theros gods made your dudes unblockable or pumped them or gave them all an Anthem or deathtouch....it seems like the Amonkhet gods will be more along the lines of a champion fighter ready to smash your opponents face in as long as you have the right conditions.The keywords will be fairly basic.....white will be indestructible and vigilant fly will be indestructible and flying....its the trigger conditions that will make or break them. And I dont see them specifically using the block mechanics either since other than being enchantments themselves I dont think the theros gods had any specific block mechanic did they? Like Constellation or whateverThough theyll probably have triggeredactivated abilities that will HELP the set mechanics. Hez the Pervert gives you a discard outlet which will help with the army of Embalmed you Boros players will undoubtedly be trying......so maybe the Black god would do something on discard?

After Nim Deathmantle becomes equipped to a creature that creature will be a black Zombie not any other colors or creature types.Im thinking that either the mechanics article is mistaken about the creature retaining its type or the reminder text is shortened to save space.EDIT Or third option theres a rules update coming that will make in addition to its other types redundant.

11692578,0,t3_66u56p,Are you playing Draw Go style magic? The problem with this in EDH is exactly what you described. Holding up mana in a multi person pod is at best playing to survive. EDH especially casual EDH is about proactive and developed board states. Very few decks can control three opponents at once. The only archetype that does this is Stax. Lets say you run traditional cards that affect the entire board board wipes mass sacrifice effects etc.You may be controlling the board but youre playing to stay alive. Its a fear driven playstyle that performs poorly in this format. My advice is always be working towards something in every EDH game. Play the draw spell cast the creature ramp the fuck out. Counterspell dont matter until late game or whenever your meta tends to turn the corner. ,EDH,dgldefs,8,t5_2scee

Ivorytusk just isnt good in your deck its basically pseudovigilance which is not worth all that mana or even a card slot.As for the rest I really do strongly suggest the green draw spells.

11706610,0,t1_dgmymx3,Being one of the most played cards means nothing Especially since the vast majority of EDH decks are hot trash which is genuinely ok as long as everyone in the playgroup wishes to play hot trash.Its not a single sorcery that wins. If it was itd be great. Instead its a single sorcery that sometimes wins maybe. Its far from autoinclude and will be worse than many other potential options in the majority of monoblack decks. If youre playing with people that let your Nirkana Revenant and Crypt Ghast sit around youre not winning on the strength of your cards and deck but on the weakness of your opponents.This is far from a freebie. It has a very real opportunity cost and so it absolutely matters what deck its in. Not even stuff like the black ramp cards are autoinclude. If you dont need lots of mana theres little reason to run them. Autoinclude in black would be things like tutors efficient removal Necropotence etc.Youre even undermining your own argument here because many of the ways black has to get to lethal Exsanguinate involve creatures. Except in monoblack youre not able to protect them with counterspells etc. You can recur them but theres much stronger things to recur than a Crypt Ghast.If you think Exsanguinate is just the shit and every monoblack deck should run I invite you to build a monoblack deck that can hang with wellbuilt combo decks and make me eat crow. Otherwise the deckbuilding practices and MtG theory developed over many years strongly suggests otherwise.,EDH,dgmz0ez,1,t5_2scee

Competitive players dont care if youre playing hard lockdown Stax or fast As Nauseum. At that level of cEDH all strategies are fair. Casual players hate playing against Stax and fast combo because such deck archetypes stifle their own brews. Even though Derevi is no longer a true competitive general many casual players will bemoan her presence. Another hallmark of casual players is the emphasis on time and turns.

Guess I dont keep up with the standard trends.If you go with the vigilance idea I would consider reducingcutting the number of inspired creatures you have and going allin with the not wanting to tap your dudesdudettes on attack in the first place theme.,EDH,dgtvc3q,1,t5_2scee

11785947,0,t1_dgv9rwx,Im running a pretty much standard Boonweaver deck but was just looking for other options to do with the pieces I already have for the combo. From what Ive seen most pure boonweaver decks will run victimize to get them back Auramancer or something like that so they can kick start the combo early if Boonweaver ends up stuck in deck somewhere,EDH,dgvz5kq,1,t5_2scee

11800848,0,t3_68c18f,Id add more ramp. Reduce the vehicles a bit. Demolition Stomper Your life gain looks pretty low Impact so that wont help the deathstar plan.  Also you dont run enough solider makers to be consistent.   Maybe look up decks dedicated to each of these themes for inspiration Lifegain and Solider Tribal. Just how slow Is your playgroup.  Aslo you could probably run necropotence and phyrexian arena as a power though pain thing  I dunno how but I would try to get these in. ,EDH,dgxo0tq,2,t5_2scee
