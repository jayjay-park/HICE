1747321,0,t3_2egt88,UB control has actually been putting up seriously good results for me. The games are grindy sure but you do have inevitability and with the right pieces covenant of blood ulcerate rotfeaster maggot peel from reality frost lynx research assistant jorubai murk lurker FESTERGLOOM etc you dont even really need a giant win condition to win the game just resilient threats like rotfeaster that can block AND swing after youve cleared their board. What UB lacks in power it makes up for in availability it seems to be relatively open when I draft because everyone goes for the convoke deck or strong red removal spells. Obviously its not always the best choice but it is open a lot more than youd think and if you give yourself some maneuverability early you can usually tell when the deck is open and draft a really strong build. ,lrcast,cjzerfb,8,t5_330dh

1810541,0,t3_2fa5kg,It depends on what you think is wrong with the decks youre creating or why you think you cant cut the cards you have.Marshall did something in a recent draft video that I really liked instead of sorting his cards by mana cost he sorted them by what turn he felt he wanted to play them. So instead of sorting Lightning Strike in the drop column he moved it over to column  or  because he hoped to take out a later stronger creature with it. That helped him realize almost all of his early plays were red and adjust his mana accordingly. More importantly he decided to cut some bigger creatures and board in some smaller spells because it revealed he really needed to hit his curve to be effective.Whether you do that or not start asking yourself questions like How does this deck win? Are there cards that dont contribute well to that? Are there cards you only want to draw against certain other cards? Those are good sideboard candidates. Maybe you end up with lots of situational cards. Look back at the cards you saw in the draft and decide which situations youre most likely to face.If all else fails and you just cant decide between two equal cards flip a coin. You cant play both and you can always change your mind when boarding.,lrcast,ck7cg05,5,t5_330dh

The results of the answer dont end up changing  Clever Imposter has a replacement effect that alters how it enters the battlefield which causes it to enter as a copy of Ixidron. Because we applied at least one replacement effect to an event we then go and check to see if any new replacement effects now apply and find that the Clever Impostor of an Ixidron has another replacement effect that alters how it enters the battlefield so we turn all the other creatures face down. We check again find no more replacement effects and the Imposter enters the battlefield as an Ixidron.Triggered abilities typically start with the words or phrases when whenever or at the beginning.

1882696,0,t1_ckg1uaj,Ill concede the point where it isnt always better for fetch over dual which is why I rated them closely off by half a grade. I value getting the land untapped over the tapped land. To me it allows you to keep tempo and continue to develop your board with the proper land you need over delaying a turn. Though I see optimal turns for the dual lands being turn  few action cards and turn  morph a dude. Once spoilers come I may shift a bit but overall both fairly equal if playing for stakes but I edge the speed of the land and getting the immediate need over long term fixing.And agree totally we are pretty much snap picking fetches when not playing for top GP. ,lrcast,ckg22ro,1,t5_330dh

1942424,0,t3_2gwbck, OP  No stick to  cards.  If you find that you are frequently milling yourself then you need to go back and rethink your deck.The bottom line is that a truely dedicated delve deck is going to function like a hyper ramp deck or other combo decks.  Youll dump cards into your yard in order to land a fatty on turn  or .  In order to do that I can see running  selfmill enablers.  Much like classic combo decks you want to end the game fast on the back of a turn  Howler or Scavengers or whatnot.If this isnt your decks plan youre just a value delve deck in which case I wouldnt play more than  or  dedicated delve enablers which is not enough to mill you.,lrcast,ckn9f1i,2,t5_330dh

2135164,0,t1_clb7ld1,I mostly meant the  and  drop slot because I think it is critical in the match. Nothing compares to Ainok BondKin no disagreement there. Disowned Ancestor is also quite good probably a bit better.However I dont think either green card you listed is better. I think youre underrating the optional flying. Yes its expensive. No its not good when youre hoping to close the game out by turn . But in my experience few games are going that fast. Leaping Master helps a ton in getting the last few points of damage in and also blocks many of the fliers such as Jeskai Windscout if it comes down to that.When I first saw the card I thought it was terrible and I refused to play him in my deck. But over the next few drafts he consistently gives me a ton of use in my redwhite based decks both Jeskai and Mardu because he just seems to fit. Jeskai wants to race and trick the opponent into getting an alpha strike they werent expecting which this guy seems to do and Mardu has explosiveish starts especially when you really want to raid turn  but might have trouble pushing the last few points in which this guy also helps to do. And like all your  drops need to do he kills morphsbashes for two.Hes not pulling me into those colors. But he goes late and I will be playing him if Im in those colors. Hes not supposed to be Wooly Loxodon which I will first pick but I definitely like having even two or three of him in a deck.

2169361,0,t3_2jvyto,This is a term that is applied to a bunch of situations. The term is usually used while talking about a very specific situation that is unlikely to come up or will have a very small or precise impact if it does.One can be having a  hour discussion about the merits of running a Rugged Highlands over a Temple of Abandon. Another might be figuring out when is the right situation to bring in Blinding Spray out of the sideboard.Ive also heard it used in the context of not having enough playables for a draft where you have to go deep to figure out a situation where some normally terrible card might make the cut. Finally going deep can also be interpreted in the case of committing to a strategy. For instance playing multiple Taigans Schemings to enable delve could be classified as going deep.Hope that helps!

2281025,0,t1_cltldk0, Dont mind messing with the mana base its been the biggest problem for me as I basically always want  blue sources and a red source on turn  but i cant afford too many of my lands to come into play tapped because having nullify available on turn  is very important. As mentioned in the edit i have a negate void snare taken out for  mindswipe which is a better additional kill condition than an extra swiftspear so thats worth noting if ur looking for that extra punch. This is probably a good decision ill test out the searing bloods and see if im happier with them on paper i like the edit. Im surprised to hear this about void snare its been a nearMVP for me in a lot of matchups sometimes i just need to tap out for an anger of the gods or something and it allows them to resolve  real threat and void snare has been awesome at getting that  real threat off the board and back into the counterspell stall especially with things like whip and planeswalkers.,lrcast,cltnhnb,1,t5_330dh

2306200,0,t3_2lofcw,Dont confuse cantrips and looting. They are not the same effect and the same logic doesnt apply.Looting you are correct. Looting  of the time reads pitch a basic land draw a card.. Obviously that allows you to run more lands because you expect to pitch them if you draw too many. You get card draw in exchange for lands.Cantrips on the other hand DO NOT let you pitch lands. So where does the card draw come from? you trade card draw for TEMPO and card draw in exchange for running highly conditional spells. Thats important. More lands will still get stranded in your hand.  Also a cantrip will never reduce the number of lands in your hand well the cantrips in this set but it might increase them. So cantrips will let you hit land drop  but they will never help you avoid flooding. What do you need to play cantrips? options. Sometimes you have the free mana and can afford the tempo so yes I would like to play this free card or you have  prowess guys on the field so its not even sacrificing tempo the cantrip is now just fair value.But the important thing you cant always afford the tempo and in this format with prowess most of the cantrips are highly dependent on board presence. Its critical to have alternate spells to cast so that your cantrips are not stranded in your hand. Its tempting to think you can cycle them but you are both reducing the total number of spells you have available you pitch a spell you draw  of a spell and  of a land and again you hemmorage tempo. Badly if you dont have a board presence and are trying to defiant strike your opponents creatures. Cantrips are not looting and its very important to understand that they essentially have the EXACT OPPOSITE pressure on your mana base. Loot encourages more lands whereas cantrips push you to have a lower curve and ensure you have enough spells to cast to enable the cantrips to be good. Basically the scary situation for a cantrip is that you flood out too early your threats all get removed and you end up having to spew your cantrips onto an empty board. ,lrcast,clwrh2h,7,t5_330dh

2573642,0,t3_2p87yo,Congrats!Im by no means an expert but I do ok on MTGO so here are my c.When zoning in on a color pair you usually want to draft two colors and splash the third not get a full  color deck try choosing a pair that fits more than one clan white red as opposed to red black for example  It gives an escape plan if the original clan you had in mind happens to be cut.This also applies to picking a  color bomb pp. e.g. if you pick Surrak you are better off focusing on green blue or blue red rather than green red. You can find yourself ending up in the wrong clan for your bomb in which case too bad but if you can get some free fixers later in the draft for your bomb you could try to splash it anyway. Dont pick up dual lands for your splash color until you are fairly sure that its the splash color you wantunless theres really nothing else in the pack otherwise theyd be wasted picks on top of the picks you wasted speculating towards that color. ,lrcast,cmuih9c,2,t5_330dh

2643343,0,t1_cn3kjoe, Counter Spells. Youre right about the false reasoning I apply here there may be too many cards of similar effect here. I guess Ill get rid of Cancel. Im not willing to run Mana Leak yet because that seems like a format defining counter spell. So for now Essence Scatter and Negate it is. It is also a matter of showcasing blue here so I would like to have a reasonable amount of those spells in the Cube show them what blue is famous for! Tap effects. You have me interested on the number of tap effects here. Frost Lynx is a tap effect as well though its even a freeze effect. If we want to up the number of tap effects we have more cards to choose from Frost Breath Downpour and Panic Attack well sort of. Yes Frost Breath is the best of the bunch but I like to diversify my effects a little bit. With that and Frost Lynx and Sleep in mind I think I would rather run Downpour. That card seems still playable to me although less of an all star. Still a handy tool for aggressive decks though. Another option is to run Panic Attack in red. It could replace Wild Guess as card draw is something not typical for red so I wont miss it that much if that effect would go away in red. You say Research Assistant gums up the ground I dont see how Seacoast Drake couldnt do the same. I absolutely see how Research Assistant is way better though as that card is good both in the early and in the long game where Seacoast Drake will become useless when the game goes long. Right now I see Seacoast Drake as a sideboard card for controlling strategies that they bring in against token strategies and against decks with a lot of small flyers. Another looting effect really seems to be too much. Blue already has so many cards that improve card qualityquantity Merfolk Looter Scroll Thief Foresee Azure Mage Military Intelligence Opportunity and six rares I dont think this Cube needs another one. I might come back from this when Ive played this Cube a lot but well see. I think I overvalue Encrust targeting artifacts indeed you make a very good point there. So that makes the question do we want Encrust or do we want a better version of Encrust. Encrust is indeed a worse Assassinate. It might be the spot I want the removal of blue to be but Im not sure. Claustrophobia just reads as a CMC Pacifism though I dont think theres an alternative way to untap. That makes it a very good removal spell still. Isnt that too good for blue? I also think youre right when it comes to me evaluating the Rings I only seem to think about the things that can go right with them not with what can go wrong. Ill promise myself not to worry about them too much especially with the faster format now that M is included in this sketch,lrcast,cn3m8i5,1,t5_330dh

2681322,0,t3_2qb84f,Cross posted from the LR ... threadWhile I very much enjoy Kenjis love of the game and his dedication to putting out content via his stream amp videos theres just something about his guest hosting spots that dont do it for me. Its hard to describe this feeling but it seems like Kenji is better at putting his joy for Magic into words than expressing technical concepts on the podcast. He feels more like a hypemancheerleader for the game I dont want to diminish this its valuable than the tutorprofessortype of hosts weve previously had on LR.Part of this is certainly driven by the topics of his appearances on the show especially in this most recent hang time episode. Perhaps Kenji would bring more nutsandbolts analysis in a more focused podcast discussion. Still I cant shake the feeling that his onair personality is based more on I love Magic and Here is some really cool stuff Ive done playing Magic and less on Heres how players with less experience than me can really improve at Magic.

2795670,0,t3_2s3izh,Id suggest   with  sources youre REALLY stretching it. You dont need  red sources you can probably get away with  or even . You definitely need more white sources and maybe one more black. I would consider cutting the Mardu Roughrider and  mountains in favor of  plains and  swamp for R W B? And that also cuts down on the number of cards that require B and W.Swiftspear is fine but not amazing in my opinion. You can keep her though gives you a way to trigger raid and the threat of her becoming a  makes her attack into morphs well. I only play goblinslide if Im running like  spells  otherwise the likelihood of making enough goblins off of it is kind of low. I wouldnt worry so much about needing food for the butcher  hes super powerful as just a  flier without needing the other abilities.

2796369,0,t1_cnlvp2y,He may end up being the best onedrop in your pile of cards pretty often. In virtually all those cases you should just not run any drops its really not a big deal  curves very often start on  in KtK its not super rare to have them start on  and tapland is very often your best turn  play.Basically counting on bolster to make this into a good range is using  bad cards to make  good well decent card. That is almost never worth it unless the good is very very good i.e. VaultKey basically reads you win the game here if you can hit this with a Mastodons bolster  then yeah you wont be unhappy  but its unlikely.The other thing is if you bolster this you arent bolstering something else. True this is evasive but that is a marginal upside over the alternative  and reasonably often you just need a big thing anyway to interact with their creatures favorably.Finally youre not actually likely to have that many bolster cards anyway  theres only one pack of FRF in the draft. Its worth noting that this guy is also a warrior so theres those synergies but theres more or less nothing to actually promote that strategy in FRF theres several creatures with the Warrior type but only  very weak effects that care about the type so youre mostly relying on uncommons from KtK which we now have only  packs of. ,lrcast,cnlxqkz,1,t5_330dh

2820736,0,t1_cnoolp5,I think its tough to actually give the fetches a grade since they dont take up a spell slot in the deck.

3162210,0,t3_2wd7rb,Your deck looks pretty sweet with a few caveats its light on removal as you mentioned and you only have  creatures recommended is  and I think you should have included Mardu Hateblade.  Nevertheless sometimes your deck just doesnt get there because of variance or opposing bombs.  Its kind of a running joke among my playgroup that the sweetest decks always go .  Some of my  decks are the most durdley pieces of garbage ever drafted. As for the draft portion here are some critiquesPP Wild Slash over Soul Summons.  Its a great removal spell in the land of morphs and Soul Summons is basically just a bear with slight upside.PP Harsh Sustenance over Douse in Gloom.  If youre already in BW Harsh Sustenance has basically the same floor and a much higher ceiling.PP Any creature over Grave Strength.  Grave Strength is basically a creature aura with all its vulnerabilities getting killed in response or bounced with the possibility of completely whiffing on the mill.PP Rats and Angler are close but Id pick Rats.  In Khans theres Hooting Mandrills Shambling Attendants and Sultai Scavenger that can act like a delve curvetopper Typhoid Rats usually always makes the maindeck because of its ability to block well in the early game.PP Pressure Point over Map the Wastes.  Map the Wastes has generally been underwhelming if there is no bolster target and competes for the drop slot with morphs anyway.PP Channel Harm over Hooded Assassin.  Its pretty insane that Channel Harm has wheeled and it has such a high power level Safe Passage  removal that I would take it in a heartbeat over basically a vanilla .PP Sultai Scavenger over Burn Away.  Its a decent evasive body that will make the maindeck while you arent even in red.Hope this helps.,lrcast,coprf9l,2,t5_330dh

3265542,0,t3_2xe8kk,I think theres a lot of factors but format and deck power definitely affects the outcome. A hall of famer vs. a casual player with two intro decks is going to have a technical advantage but intro decks arent consistent or redundant so the casual player will probably sneak some wins in. As you move from intro packs to competitive standard deck through Modern towards LegacyVintage you get to scenarios where the newbie simply cant win because decks are very consistent but require a deep technical knowledge to play.Still thats not a meaningful number. I guess in theory a PT player could boost their morale and mop up at some FNMs fairly regularly but Im pretty sure when someone mentions a pros win rate they mean at PT events because thats when they play similarlyskilled players and theres enough variance in most formats to steal quite a few wins even when they have the better deck.,lrcast,cp0hymr,1,t5_330dh

3982340,0,t1_cra5woi,Personally I dont mind this week on the PT at least as far as Ive seen it havent listened to this weeks episode yet though. I find them fairly informative I feel like a significant chunk of the listenership keeps up with what happens at GPs and PTs and such and probably watches them and when we do its nice to hear what went on from your perspective. For instance I watched the last few rounds of GP San Jose and I really appreciated being able to hear what was going on through your head after Id watched your picksplays.What I dislike much more is fluff that doesnt even reach the level of this week on the PT. For instance all the talk about the Modern Rotisserie Draft from a month or so back. I have never done one of these probably never will and despite the  community ones that cropped up most of the listenership probably never will either. I know Marshall was excited about it and all but I didnt really feel like it merited much more than a second hey check out this thing thats going on on the subreddit you might find it interesting. I recall having similar feelings when MarshallBWong played incommentated in the Vintage Rotisserie Draft back... whenever that was.As long as Im telling you what I want to see in the podcast Ill throw in one more suggestion  I really really liked the crackadraft Marshall did awhile back. Crackapack is nice but I feel like it mostly boils down to a cardbycard discussionevaluation especially after the set has been out for more than a couple weeks. I know the format of opening several packs and having somebody else make the picks and having listeners remember what was in previous packs is difficult but I think it would be much more helpful. Ive taken to posting my first  packs on the subreddit every now and then and Ive thought the discussion and reading other peoples picks was really really interesting. Ive found it very insightful to see how highlylowly other people value weaker oncolor cardstronger offcolor cards based on what our first two picks were how willingnotwilling people are to change direction pick  etc etc. Maybe you could make it a video segment and stick it up on the website or something.,lrcast,cra801j,5,t5_330dh

4001750,0,t3_369qqc,Id dump the Monument War Flare Gleam of Authority and maybe the second Kindled Fury and then throw in Harsh Sustenance.     Deathmist Raptor is a solid card but splashing a fourth color without more fixing is going to get you screwed on your manabase.As far as the cards I listed are concerned you dont need ramp so badly that you can afford a dead turn  especially with all the drops youre running in your deck.  War Flare is a decent card but you arent playing tokens so youre going to end up with it rotting in your hand more times than not.  And Gleam has a similar problem in that youre not playing enough stuff that givesgets  counters and relying on morphs to buff it means that you dont even want to draw it until  turns into the game to make the best case scenario outweigh the chance that youre just going to play it as a worse Runemark.,lrcast,crcfiu4,1,t5_330dh
4003494,0,t3_36bve0,PP Profaner of the Dead and Vultrous Aven are both amazingly strong  dont underestimate those and while Stampeding Elk Herd is good its not as good as either of the other two options. You were correct to pass up Swift Warkite here though  even though it combos incredibly well with Dutiful Attendant its too early to commit to two colors so early in the draft.PP Correct pick here Twin Bolt is amazing.  PP Ouch.  Dont get too married to your first pick  especially for the first few picks definitely stay open and take the most powerful cards in the pack rather than committing to stay on color for your Elk Herd.  Youthful Scholar is far and away the best card in this pack with Coat with Venom as a distant second.  PP Enduring Scalelord is tough but since youre already so heavy green its a reasonable choice.  Gurmag Drowner is easily my favorite card in this pack and youre getting a LOT of blue  black being fed to you from the right.  PP Sadly Savage Ventmaw is a fairly weak dragon as dragons go and his ability is far less relevant than most other dual color dragons.  I can understand why you picked this one up but Dutiful Attendant is probably my pick from this pack.  Arguments could also be made for Savage Ventmaw Belltoll Dragon Lightwalker Loremaster Servant of the Scale Spidersilk Net etc.  Lots of really good choices in this pack and its a very strong pack overall.  PP Fine choice considering youre so heavy green.  I favor Shambling Goblins in this pack but thats more personal preference and which colors I prefer to draft.  PP Center Soul is indeed very very good.  If youre hoping to go towards the long game dont underestimate Dunecaster but I think Center Soul is likely the best pick here.  PP Marshalk is a tank and is probably my choice.  However youve staked a large claim in green by this point and another Bowmasters is acceptable.PP Oh geeze the Dutiful Attendant wheeled?  Black must be WIDE open  thats an incredibly strong signal that black exploit has little competition.  Your pick is understandable but black is still as attractive as ever.  PP Good pickup green is likely open also.P Fine pickups.  Nice to see you get a Spidersilk Net  I think that card is super valuable especially in green given that it grants Reach and is a nice pair of pants as well.  Very valuable card against any sort of flier deck.,lrcast,crcmoap,4,t5_330dh

4261371,0,t3_39s4r4,. Lightning Bolt  I think its easily the best card in the pack and a great start.  . Nest Invader  I think it comes down to Guildmage and Invader. I think it might be wrong but Im taking Invader because it lends itself to colorramp quite nicely and thats where I want to be in this format. So when its close I give that the edge. That said Ive never played with the Guildmage before so I could just be vastly underestimating it.  . Kozileks Predator  Feelin good.  . Spread the Sickness  Removal is always good. Unconditional removal is better and though its expensive the upside of proliferate is not irrelevant. Scion is a close second given our double token makers so early into the draft.  . Golgari Rot Farm  Bounce land fixing is excellent here. Another Guildmage and another Scion but fixing.  . Artisan of Kozilek  Our first ramp target and while Ive never played with it before Artisan seems really good. Immediate value when it comes into play helps mitigate the high mana cost I think.  . Evolving Wilds  Wilds is a great flex fix. It grabs whatever you basic you need the most right away. I think the fixing at this point is a little more important than the Manta especially since we just picked up a big fatty.  . Azorius Chancery  Totally offcolor but a bounce land is a bounce land and this keeps us in the game for a good color base. Hopefully that Gruul Turf from pack  comes back.,lrcast,cs5z4ej,2,t5_330dh

Note that Im not saying that any effort will have this impact as Ive said elsewhere I do think there are lowhanging fruit in these arguments.

If Im making people unhappy I reserve the right to decide that thats too bad for them.There are easy cases here that I think are covered under existing dont be an asshole guidelines eg. dont call your female opponent a cunt when she wins. The harder cases are when a discussion topic gets brought up as happens here someone expresses an opinion that is unpopular as I often do and then that person gets told to shut up because their unpopular opinion is considered hurtful and misogynistic.

4498770,0,t1_csxoqnh,Nah this is the exact opposite of what you want. In these prerelease sealed you get effectively  packs of playables. That is more than you get in team sealed. You will have such an overabundance of playables in one of the decks that youll find yourself at  cards before starting to cut its an insanely large sealed pool. Basically choose different colors build one deck with answers lategame and an ability to hold up counterspells for their bombs which they will have awesomely plenty of. Flyeronly removal is the same as premium removal. My pick for colors would be black and red building a redblue spells deck with burn and counters and then either blackwhite enchantress or blackgreen beef depending on the pool.Always keeping mana open enables you alot of play options than your opponents and allows you to get the highest skill edge out of deck construction and play. Because you can both commit to the board and keep mana open in HG you should do so. ,lrcast,csxq3so,1,t5_330dh

4539794,0,t3_3d8j5c,I think this is a very good question and one that Id like to hear LSV and Marshal answer as well. Personally my process goes something likeFind the strongest card. If one stands out and its in a color that Im in or if Im still open take it. If there are  or  cards that are close in power level such that its not obvious which is the strongest card I take a moment and consider the archetypes that the cards fit in and usually let that guide my decision.Assess the overall strength of the pack. In early picks this helps you get an idea about what you might wheel which will give you a good idea of whats open. In later picks this amounts to you reading what colors are open for you and helps you get an idea of if you should move into a color.If a pick isnt clear and youre stuck with a choice between  medium power cards consider what your deck already looks like and which one better fits your current gameplan. This is more helpful later in the draft. For example if youre drafting Khans and youre in pack  and have the makings of a Jeskai deck and youve already got a ton of prowess creatures you should probably take the combat trick over the random dude. ,lrcast,ct2vc8w,3,t5_330dh

4560492,0,t3_3dhbdl,I have to disagree with the rating on Sigil of the Empty Throne B even on buildaround.  I played a WB enchantment deck on the prerelease with two Weight of the Underworld a Suppression Bonds an Infernal Scarring a Shadows of the Past and a Blightcaster and Sigil was by far the least useful card in the deck.  Over the course of  rounds I never got more than  angel on the field in any given game.  I had way too many times when I played the card after Id already emptied my hand of enchantments because I had to use them as removal in the earlier parts of the game.  And dropping it on turn  felt really bad because I was just not doing anything on the board then hoping that I drew into my other enchantments.It might get better with a couple TotemGuide Hartebeest but at that point your deck is extremely high curve and youre probably just going to get blown out by your average midrange deck that can curve out and threaten lethal before your combo gets off the ground.Honestly I feel like Sigil is a strictly worse Skywise Teachings.  Teachings came out at  less mana and synergized with Rebound really well.  You get bigger creatures with Sigil but it just takes so much more effort to get it rolling.  And on top of that the enchantments you want to draft are the strong removalbased enchantments that everybody else wants to draft anyway so its not like youre going to be just wheeling cards that nobody else wants.Edit I want to point out that you guys failed to mention the biggest upside of Sword of the Animist Every time you pull a land card with it youre thinning out your deck and improving the chances of drawing gas.  It effectively improves your late game by reducing the chances of flooding out.,lrcast,ct5gtwt,2,t5_330dh

I passed on one or two Infernal Scarring that might have made the deck much better.  I had one more Weight of the Underworld in the SB that I couldnt decide what to cut.  Other weakness was my end game I didnt really have a great finisher and was overlyreliant on my removal to get my small guys through.  Rogues Passage would have been great in several instances.Hartebeest was bonkers good every time I played it.  I never managed to do anything with the Knight or the Spirits.  They ended up dying or doing nothing on a congested board.  I managed to trigger Blightcaster once throughout my matches.  Seemed worth it but again I needed more enchantments.

Podcasts can give you a lot of help figuring out what makes a card good and can give you a general idea of what the thought process should be behind your decisions. But its very very easy for something to get lost in translation from Point A to Point B.Watch drafts on Twitch or ChannelFireball or any of a dozen places. Think about what you would do in the situation see if they do the same thing and if not try to understand why. I know way back when I was just getting started this was how I picked up on mulliganing hands that do nothing even if they have a good spellland ratio on the idea of using my mana as efficiently as possible and perhaps most importantly on playing around their outs when Im ahead and playing to mine when Im behind.The quickest thing you can do though is just to post some decklists so we can see if theres any fundamental flaws there.,lrcast,ctc0pac,1,t5_330dh

Id mainboard the second valakut invoker this card will win you prolonged games much more reliably than a  or a  against a deck that has stabilized.

5465034,0,t3_3pwgil,I get what youre saying but I think its more important to understand why certain cards are in your deck. Broodhunter Wurm is a fine card and there are many reasons it should be in your deck even if youre unhappy. You may have even drafted your seat optimally and still have to play it.Whats important is that it fits your plan.Player A is correct that the Wurm isnt the best but unless theyre making a suggestion that another card is more playable its really moot.Player B is also correct and arent as stifled as you suggest if theyre playing it for a reason.One of the best pieces of drafting advice that I ever got was from Raph Levy. He said that as the metagame matures as is happening now in Battle a successful player will find ways to extract value from underplayed cards. Broodhunter Wurm seems like just that kind of card. It lacks synergy but sometimes you just need a four power creature to fend off and trade with landfalldevoidally creatures until your plan comes online.,lrcast,cwa7kd4,2,t5_330dh

5523066,0,t1_cwhkzsl,Exactly.I think people are misinterpreting unplayable as cannot possibly win with green cards in your deck which is not the case.What unplayable actually means to Owen is that playing Green is detrimental to your win percentage. In his opinion you can still win by remaining open to Green but youll win more if you just ignore it. I dont agree nor disagree and theres no way to definitively provedisprove his theory but this was the conclusion that was arrived at by their entire team which just so happens to be one of the best MTG teams in the world Pantheon.At the Pro Tour while some players avoided Green other players remained open to it hoping that having a larger share of Green cards would offset the colors weakness. When all was said and done Green was statistically the worst color by a fair margin. So when Owen says thats the case and Top ed the event his entire team agrees with him statistics agree with him. Who are we to say that hes flat out wrong?,lrcast,cwhmdk6,11,t5_330dh
5526800,0,t3_3qs1bp,Land destruction can be ok against an opponent running a greedy mana base.

I am referring to constructed play though.,lrcast,cwi3j3n,2,t5_330dh
5537651,0,t3_3qypzu,So I had the opposite. Im very good at deckbuilding and did extremely well at sealed. But it took me a really long time to learn the skills associated with draft. So in one sense it seems like you might just be very good at draftspecific skills and about average at the more universal skills of deck construction given a particular pool and actually playing magic. I would consider focusing on those areas. Once they catch up to your draft skills you should see a more even win percentage.Another possibility is that you are just not adjusting your deck properly for the differences between the draft and sealed formats. One somewhat obvious thing is that you are far less likely to have a solid twocolour deck in sealed than in draft. Are you trying to force yourself into two colours or are you accepting the necessity to usually splash a third or even fourth and run some fixing? Fourcolour converge for example is a far stronger deck in sealed than in draft.The other thing is that the sealed format is a lot slower than the draft format. Peoples curves and manabases are worse so games go longer. One thing this means especially in BFZ is that being prepared to deal with big eldrazi is much more vital in sealed than in draft.,lrcast,cwjhf7s,1,t5_330dh

5637634,0,t1_cwvuxmb,Im currently sorting by total number of games won in which a card was played adjusted by the frequency at which that card will appear in a draft. If you compare it to just the other commons so we can forget about the frequency adjustment then you can see the number of games won in which Tightening Coils was played is in the same order of magnitude of cards like Demons Grasp Spell Shrivel and Sheer Drop.Also I am now sorting by absolute number of games won again adjusted for frequency of appearance rather than the win . In this way I am basically counting every game in which a card was not played as a game loss for that cardwhich I think is fair because a card that cannot be played in many games and accordingly not in many decks is not a very high pick. This greatly reduces the bias towards high CMC cards.,lrcast,cwvwhpu,1,t5_330dh

5826066,0,t1_cxj48qm,I completely disagree. The draft metagame has moved. Most people are trying to draft a synergy deck. This creates a hole in the metagame exploitable by being aggressive. Here are a couple of reasons to lower your curve. The blue devoid deck which is the most powerful deck in the format is a tempo deck. The most commonly seen reward card for  ingestprocess is murk strider. Clutch of currents is one of the best commons in the set. One way to counteract these powerful tempo plays is to play cheap spells that can be redeployed quickly due to not costing a lot of mana. Having a board presence even after these tempo spells come down means youre still in the game and can still be ahead. Bouncing a  drop just isnt the same as bouncing a  drop.. The format has some really underdrafted combat tricks that you can turn into tempo blowouts. Sure strike in particular can make a  beat a  which costs  mana in this format. Drafting an aggressive curve makes these cards good late pickups.. Having a low curve turns outnumber into lightning bolt or better. Its best in a token deck but even in an aggressive deck with lots of creatures it really shines.Were at a point in the metagame where everyone is trying to build a fancy synergy deck. I actually advocate building CABS style decks now since everyone is stealing each others synergy cards you can get wins through having a great curve while theyre fumbling around.,lrcast,cxjbmkr,6,t5_330dh

Its great to see what your original thought process was and why that line of thinking was based either on incorrect assumptions about the format or emotional memories of the card in previous times. It really helps me when trying to reevaluate my own assumptions.I did not like random pack openings as much as I thought I would. Still fun when you do it on stream though.Dedicated sealed episodes are good but I think itd be helpful also to have discussion of variant sealed formats like  pack sealed and  pack sealed which are quite relevant formats. Especially if they greatly differ from the  pack format.I liked the addition of gossip about pro life. I found the stories of your youth to be excellent human interest pieces. In particular the stories about ridiculous beats such as when you beat owen without playing anything. It was an illustrative lesson about being prepared for your match.I really liked cabs and ubers because they are really fundamental points which are generally helpful. I still think the have a plan episode is one of the most important and like PVDDRs article about great players says really distinguishes players and is worth emphasizing. However I do think itd be helpful to give more guidance on how to identify your plan and in particular how to tell when your plan is different from the usual one. For example on what occassion is it appropriate to run a bunch of blisterpods in your deck even if it is usually incorrect? How can you tell if youre reading the signals correctly but someone passcut you at the last moment? Finally as a separate point which I think would be helpful I do think itd be nice to get some more detail on how to practice magic to learn from it the most. Owen raised a good point about trying to take a lesson away from when you lose and I feel like this is a point that has been raised several times before.

Its also wrath insurance.They left a lot of aggressive black cards in this cube to make it worth going RB. Gravecrawler and the  raid warrior are good cards in a red deck that you can get REALLY late. These are pretty good when someone else is drafting red and fill out your one drop requirements.

6461458,0,t3_445fza,I think its playable but I still dont think its great its still probably the worst of the colors in a vacuumits just a question of whether its color pairings are strong enough to move it up. The problem to me is that their commons are all fine but not amazingNetcaster is good but compared to cards like Isolation Zone or Oblivion Strike or Boulder Salvo I think it falls short. Blue even has Containment Membrane and Ive found Greens removal spell Elemental Uprising to be very subpar again.That said I think more of Greens commons are solid and more of the Green cards in BFZ are better so Im not actively looking to stay out of Green now. I just see it as slightly weaker than the other colors.

6478564,0,t3_44bnrc,Ill tell you one thing for sure they usually shouldnt be three colors splashing sevendrops. Youve got some powerful aggressive notes but youve kind of inverted the mana curve and with the splash reduced your chances of really hitting those notes perfectly. If were really talking about an aggressive deck you want to cut the curve in half and shove it all the way to the left. Start at two end at five and hope to play two spells a turn from four on.Often that deck wont actually end up being the best available at your seat though. And you cant be halfin on aggro since if you are you end up basically playing most of your games as a bad midrange deck where your opponents are just that perfect halfstep slower where they outclass your plays and you dont get enough of a speed advantage to make them pay for playing more expensive spells. Given that you were probably better off just going BG here. The deck itself isnt bad. It can curve out with enough power to end the game early. Its just giving up more equity in long games than its probably getting back in short ones.I probably wouldnt assume I can draft aggro in any given draft. But taking the simply good cards like Commando burn and removal early and then seeing Freerunners and Immobilizers in the middle of the pack it definitely starts looking like one of the least fair ways to play this format. When you play your fourth or even fifth! creature on turn  and then use the rest of your mana to Salvo their drop away...It feels like playing monored in Cube.,lrcast,czpfisu,1,t5_330dh

Thug in reference to a militant mutated horror is an old MtG trope exemplified by a good chunk of the Mercenary creature type Its an open question whether or not the speaker was trying to make the inference youre attributing to him and whether this monstrosity should be construed as representing an africanamerican male.gt It doesnt seem overtly racist but it is easy to see how somebody who is the victim of subtle and overt acts a of racism on a daily basis whether carried out by individuals or by institutions just because they happen to be a person of color living Western society could be offended.Correct but not relevant since we already agree that people could be offended by this. The question is whether the offense they take is justified andor should motivate us to not make such statements.gt Empathy is what separates regular people from from psychopaths. If you cant see how considering how the words you use can make you a better person and the world a better place then I would suggest you do some serious selfreflection.Would you be emphatic enough toward someone who held homophobic views to not discuss the topic only on the basis of their negative feelings toward gay relationships? The point of my example is that you cant justify ignoring the wishes of a homophobe and respecting the wishes of a minority on the same basis in this case. Both of them feel worse when the topic for which they have ire is discussed so if youre going to respect one but not the other it has to be on a basis other than just empathy.gt There is a difference between making offensive comments about peolples gender race age etc who they are and have no control over is much different than just talking about a subject that someone objects to on a moral or ethical basis and is therefore offended like sex or athiesm or something.Being offended by the word thug is not an innate unchangeable quality.,lrcast,czq887g,1,t5_330dh

6528010,0,t3_451fuj,PP I think this pick is fine. Reality Hemorrhage gets worse in multiples and Maw is a solid creature that I think often goes later than it should. Stalking Drone and Expedition Raptor arent necessarily enough to convince me to take another color.PP Between Embodiment of Insight Tajuru Pathwarden Immobilizer Eldrazi and Zadas Commando this is a really good sign that RG is open. I think Embodiment is the most powerful so the pick is fine.PP With two drops already I like this Cinder Hellion a lot less. I would take Loam Larva or Tranquil Expanse to open up future splashes.PP Late War Cleric may be a signal that white is open but our colors seem open too and the Seers Lantern is good.PP Another great sign wheeling these good red and green cards.PP I would take Vines here its a good trick and I think I would always maindeck the first one. Its also good against fliers just like the Tears is.PP Here I would take Hedron Crawler. I havent had much success with Reckless Bushwhacker and Im always happy having a Hedron Crawler.PP I think Goblin Freerunner is better than Netcaster Spider.PP At this point you are fairly desperate for a turn  play so I think you need to take Hedron Crawler over Scion Summoner.PP I agree that you should take Brute Strength here and the gold card is too greedy.PP I think Outnumber and Makindi Sliderunner are both better picks than the land here. Sliderunner to fill in the drop slot or Outnumber as a decent removal spell that synergizes with some of our cards Scion Summoners surge cards and the DarkDwellers.I think the main thing this deck is missing is the Hedron Crawlers you passed in pack . You seemed to be in the right colors but just had a very unfortunate pack .,lrcast,czujqw5,6,t5_330dh

6584437,0,t1_d00cxtq,Crush is excelent in the blue red archetype both because you can surge it but also because your other cards with surge can be redeployed more quickly than your opponents.

6589587,0,t3_45xtui,I think BW looks good but as you said its short a win condition or two. I would play the Kozileks Pathfinder to help fill this void. Id probably cut the Affa Protector which doesnt do very much in this deck.

6679344,0,t1_d0a6fke,Well I think it would be foolish not to try to play the colorless rares. The pool includes a decent number of colorless sources. Perhaps not Matter Reshaper but Endbringer and Deceiver of Forms are powerful finishers which I think the pool could use. Given that Im inclined to build the pool fairly controlling I would also probably not play Resolute Blademaster.,lrcast,d0a7bd1,2,t5_330dh

I  understand how the lack of firing can have a negative impact on the gameplay experience and the WoTC bottom line.I personally would be a huge fan of having more variety with the draft formats. I love chasing that nd draft.. For me I guess it feels more rewarding to have an additional draft than it does to win more sealed packs..

6793439,0,t1_d0m7hjs,Yeah Loam Larva looks surprisingly good here especially considering your dearth of twodrops. Id run the second Fertile Thicket over the second Swamp and then lean your mana base to slightly favor blue. You have more green cards than blue cards but all your blue spells are early drops so its much more important that you hit an early island.Nissas Renewal Kozileks Pathfinder and Call the Scions are all pretty poor here and Im not sure the Brood Butcher is worth splashing. Id cut those four for the Larva a Dampening Pulse that card is WAY better than it looks the second Embodiment of Insight that card is just a beating and a Snapping Gnarlid to give you more early game.Your best sideboard cards are double Negate and the Warping Wail  make sure to consider bringing those in after every game if youve seen enough targets for either. I think you might even want to maindeck one? But Im not sure what youd cut. Maybe the Gnarlid?,lrcast,d0mbqnt,2,t5_330dh
6803291,0,t3_48uwzu,Same as the other have said WRc with one addition. I would try to fit one or two of the hedron crawlers in. With endbringer in there ramping it out and being able to activate the abilities seems like big game. ,lrcast,d0ng344,1,t5_330dh

6854616,0,t1_d0t23cx,Also theyre all cards that dont do much in the late game. Onemana combat tricks and support spells are cards you want to cast quickly not save in your hand for after you cast Noyan Dar.Agreed that the OP should just be playing a land instead.,lrcast,d0ta1v4,2,t5_330dh
6868118,0,t3_49tpmb,I think I would play the GW. Youre hard up for removal no matter which way you go and at least GW you get to play all your bombs. And Unnatural Aggression is bad but at least you should have the biggest creatures and using it with Gideons  is kinda sweet. At the least any deck that doesnt splash Woodland Wanderer and World Breaker seems like a mistake.The only switches Id personally make to your GW deck is Holdout Settlement and  Wastes to active Stalking Drone and World Breaker for  plains forest. Id also probably play Ruin in Their Wake over Kor Castigator who gets blanked pretty quickly.  Ruin isnt great but its fixing or ramp if you dont need the fixing.,lrcast,d0ut8td,2,t5_330dh

6932460,0,t1_d122q5g,I skipped out on Void Grafted because I thought it would be too greedy to add another blue card with so few sources. After thinking about it I think Black should have a place in the build somewhere be it a splash or a main color. ,lrcast,d124c13,1,t5_330dh
6940232,0,t3_4apvrn,Early in the format I think it was Owen Turtenwald who stated that he very much dislikes relying on colorless mana and he would try to avoid it not to an extreme at all though.I almost always play  colors in OGWBFZ draft so splashing colorless for activations or including more colorless for a very good card requiring colorless mana is not a very big cost so I am fine with that.  Trying to add colorless in a  color deck in draft is a recipe for color mana screw in my view unless playing a good amount of fixing.,lrcast,d1306er,1,t5_330dh
6943443,0,t1_d13348q,I thought the same but when I looked at my fixing I realized I essentially had  black sources even with only  swamps. The splash worked out very well and Ob won me many games. You are right though it was extremely rare that he came down on turn . I absolutely agree with the matter reshaper change that card did basically nothing and was usually stranded in my hand. Thanks for your input!EDIT I just saw your point about how many times I cast Ob. I can remember I believe  times that I cast him in the  round event. But there were also  I remember where he was stranded in my hand with no double black to be seen.,lrcast,d13damq,1,t5_330dh
6999361,0,t3_4bjfv3,I agree that people are overrating it when they call it top tier removal. One comparison that comes to mind is Magma Rift which from what I remember was pretty mediocre. Now obviously Angelic Purge is better because you can sacrifice anything and kill anything and it exiles but in most cases I would expect that the cards do the same thing.Bone Splinters is a good comparison too. I think this card will be quite good if there is an archetype with enough support for it like Bone Splinters in MM. But on the other hand it could also end up like Bone Splinters in BFZ.,lrcast,d19pz8p,3,t5_330dh
7003598,0,t1_d1a77vt,Right but what about the other half of the time when its in your opening hand first few draws. You are pretty much not casting this until turn  without giving up value. Now dont get me wrong I think the card is pretty good but its not something I want multiples of.,lrcast,d1a7atv,2,t5_330dh
7028726,0,t1_d1d1s60,I can agree that its not really worth considering the other line.Yeah we probably need more information to suitably answer this question. However it may be worth considering what the opponent would do if they had either.Unity of PurposeIf the opponent has this card they will likely make the attack as they did. Hoping for the double block as that is their only opportunity to win this game.Roilmages TrickThis is a bit more complex. The opponent might want to make this attack in hopes that you let the flying damage damage through this turn and swing out next turn. However it may also be beneficial for the opponent to hold back with both creatures. That way they can eat two of your creatures if you make the attack and get another draw step if you decide not to go for it. I think in the end they would still make the attack because they are already so far behind on board.So in other words this analysis didnt get us very far and its still not certain what the play would be here.,lrcast,d1d25ks,1,t5_330dh
7046343,0,t3_4c4c4y,man lots of good rares and uncommons. displacer  brood monitorvoid grafter is gross. double advocate and the goblin is nice tix wise. i would hold onto those for a few months because the price might go up.,lrcast,d1f27d7,1,t5_330dh
7060076,0,t3_4cb2hm,You mention that white pairs well with black and blue for delirium but I would include green.

7075155,0,t1_d1i49fx,Yeah manic scribe is a bit problematic because of delirium in this set and several cards with activated abilities that can be used in the graveyard but as long as HG games go it could actually win you the game and you dont have to worry about hitting the wrong opponent with mill if you dont know who has the most card draw in their deck etc..,lrcast,d1ibz6r,2,t5_330dh

7140601,0,t1_d1prwfu,In my experience Ever After is pretty good. By the time you can play a six drop if you dont have two creatures in the graveyard youre probably winning by a good amount or alternatively youre flooding badly and there isnt going to be any one card that can turn the game around anyway.Its a six drop but its a two for one that generally gets better the worse youre losing by  all the more likely youve had a high value creature get hit by a removal spell. Its good when youre behind at parity and often when youre winning.Mindwrack Demon I only managed to get out twice and both times delirium was on. It seems like getting delirium on in sealed isnt terribly hard since youre often playing cards youd usually be avoiding in draft. I was never quite casting it on curve but that was usually more a matter of when I drew it as opposed to holding it back to ensure delirium was on. I think the reality is its fairly similar to Goldnight Castigator  potentially big downside but a powerful creature youll rarely cut. Youll probably want to make some deck building considerations around it  make sure you have a good mix of instants and sorceries and preferably a few discard outlets or self milling card or artifact creatures to hit either land or artifacts for the fourth type.Early game it beats down and if your opponent cant race the four damage isnt game ending and in deck built to the purpose can probably be resolved within a turn or two of casting. Late game delirium is probably up and its just a solid a flier. ,lrcast,d1pt5in,1,t5_330dh

7191819,0,t1_d1vn2l0,Essentially yes.  Its good to note them but in sealed since you dont get to pick your cards the count of creatures and removal for a specific color and the curve for the creatures will often be more relevant for determining your best deck than the everything elses.For example Howlpack Resurgence is a neat and potentially powerful card.  But if youve only got  wolves in your pool its not going to matter.Startled Awake is an incredibly powerful card since its an alternate wincon but if you only have  blue creatures doublecolor is VERY difficult to splash for.,lrcast,d1vne9r,2,t5_330dh
7193133,0,t3_4dzjys,The landscapes seem really bad to me. You dont care much about delerium with just one payoff card and you have plenty of other ways to pitch a land into the graveyard. Why not just run more basic plains instead?Deck looks op by the way,lrcast,d1vst16,10,t5_330dh
7220277,0,t1_d1ykgql,Theyre both good at different things. Generally speaking I prefer the Fox to the Drifter in a deck that cant make delirium happen  I think Im far more likely to see something with  toughness than  power outside of token decks and getting the extra damage in at the life total isnt nothing. Theyre pretty close so playing a twoof and oneof in the main seems like the right call. If its an unfavorable matchup for the fox then you side it out but I think its more than likely that the fox is better and even if it isnt that variety lets you have a better chance at drawing the tools you need.,lrcast,d1yw2cf,1,t5_330dh
7233584,0,t1_d20atnw,Thats a good point. I never valued Bitterblossom highly partly bc it didnt do enough when cast later in the game and I also felt like some decks can just go over the top and even some aggro decks i.e. Monored can pressure enough even against a turn  BB. But with the removal of all the artifact mana theres very little to do on turn  for nonaggro nonramp decks. So I think there has to be increased value on impactful  mana plays. I had a normal UW control deck the other day where just a merfolk looter felt like it overperformed  so Ill keep an eye out on that point.,lrcast,d20em80,1,t5_330dh
7244297,0,t1_d21e6cf,I agree with both of you but heres a different way to frame the situationSay you draft by the book  of the time and are a winning player with a  win percentage. Because you draft by the book you forgo opportunities to draft creatively which may occur say  of the time depending on your definition. And if in these situations a dynamic drafter can take advantage of nonstandards decks to the tune of a  win percentage perhaps like the OPs deck the by the book players is giving up maybe  points of win percentage overall.This isnt a huge deal and I wouldnt overstate the ability to take advantage of niche decks but gaining a few  here is the kind of thing that separates great players from good players.,lrcast,d21mhhr,7,t5_330dh

In one match I won with it game  then the opponent continually tried to play around it for the next two games. But at some point they correctly identify theyre not going to be chasmsafe forever.

Instead of a trade now you are eating a creature and replacing the card with the clue token.   Granted that is best case but it is fairly common.Compare that with a mana sorcery speed spell that can never be better than a for and will frequently be less if there is any triggered or activated abilities.It is nonintuitive because we are trained to prize removal but in this case I see why the pros are putting it out there.,lrcast,d2ek1aj,1,t5_330dh

7362421,0,t1_d2f0r74,The variance is actually different at an official event than a regular draft if I understand correctly. A normal draft has all the packs taken out of a single box which is only pseudorandomized to ensure that each box falls with a certain range you know  mythics no single rare repeated a bunch of times that sort of thing. At an event like the PT packs from a bunch of boxes are all mixed together when examined by the judges beforehand so they are much closer to actually randomized. This will actually lead to more weird occurrences like you see here where one pod might get three copies of a specific rare like Thing in the Ice than you would see in a normal draft.,lrcast,d2f2260,6,t5_330dh

7499703,0,t3_4hymmn,The real issue with the simulated reality hypothesis is not the specifics of the claim but the view that any conclusions one could draw from it are unactionable. This puts the claim firmly into the category of thought experiment or entertainment rather than having any true epistemological value in relation to the nature of reality.Coupled with the unactionability it is equivalent to the belief in a completely uninterventionist God or a belief that free will does not exist since all thought and action is physically deterministic.

7563736,0,t3_4ixf8a,I do think blue is the worst color but not by very much. I agree with your central point that people seem to underrate blue.I think the fact that its underdrafted is caused by  the perception that blue is the worst color and  the fact that blues best commons are much less flashy than the best commons of the other colors. There are no commons in blue that are just magnetic like Fiery Temper and Dead Weight. I think these kinds of cards tend to draw people into other colors early so people tend to commit to blue later in the draft or not at all.,lrcast,d31ykyn,12,t5_330dh

It would definitely be improved by replacing those cards.That said I think the power level is still reasonable.  The aggro cards arent on plan but theyre not complete blanks.  We arent talking about act of treason or lava axe.  Inspiring captain might be a hill giant most of the time but a hill giant still does something.Despite the off plan cards I believe that this deck has a reasonable power level.

7669600,0,t3_4kce3l,Sorin is in great colors for splashing since GWb and GBw are very common shells that have strong common fixing available and its a very lategame card so I think it has some of the lowest gold card tax around. Because of that I would just lean toward taking whichever card is more powerful and ignoring the cost. I think your chances of being in black generally are pretty similar to your chances of being in a deck that can play Sorin and have good mana. Assuming were not playing UB its three archetypes that can cast either card.That said I dont think the power level gap is that significant. Elusive Tormenter is a ridiculous Magic card and can easily win you games where you never hit your sixth land drop in which Sorin would have done nothing.I think I prefer Sorin because its better when youre behind and its just more of the way I LIKE to win games but I wouldnt be surprised if the actual expected winrate on the cards was very close.gtHowever it can be difficult to keep up that one mana and the one card for discarding especially if the card is not something you want to pitch. But... it is only one color allowing you to be a little more open than with Sorin. Basically Its a  for cmc with pretty good bonus stats.I think youre way underestimating how much you want to be going all in on the card. Its basically like Pack Rat. Once its in play none of your other cards matter you just want to discard them all unless theyre bonkers combos like Neglected Heirloom or Cult of the Waxing Moon. The downside is just so low because they have to have two removal spells to meaningfully interact with it and that might not even do it if you have enough resources.,lrcast,d3dzmql,7,t5_330dh

7860421,0,t3_4mzhy5,I appreciate this post. I hadnt thought about the reasons why these cards were so different until thinking it out.There are a bunch of reasons the two creatures are different  Enter the Battlefield is much better than Dies because you have control over when it happens it happens sooner and it always happens exilingbouncing  This specific Dies effect loses value even more than most as your opponent can keep a land or a less useful spell in hand since they know when it will happen  Rottenheart Ghouls body does not fit the effect well. s will often be double blocking allowing your opponent to kill the other creature if it would be particularly unfavorable at that time for them to discard a card  On the contrary Drownyard Explorers body fits its ability quite well by discouraging attacks and buying you time to draw and cast the extra card  Discarding has almost always been worse than drawing. Mind Rot is generally not a good card in draft while divination is an average card in most formats.  Discarding in this format is even worse because of Madness and Delirium  Typing is probably a slight advantage toward Ghoul as human synergies are not particularly pronounced in blue and tend not to fit in a blue deck well  Ghouls ability is free providing one advantage,lrcast,d3zkyxs,28,t5_330dh

At all. I will never cast it because its a card that does nothing to stabilize the board is highly conditional and in my opinion is worse even than the green common curve toppers thornhide wolves and delirium pig. I would literally rather run an equestrian skill in a deck with no humans if I wanted a very risky win more card. And I really dont see green as needing win conditions at all. just look at the list of delirium cards. Traverse the ulvenwald inexorable blob obsessive skinner soul swallower autumnal gloom kessig dire swine moldgraf scavenger might beyond reason deathcap cultivator.Traverse the ulvenwald is much weaker if you swap out your  mana creature for seasons past. Deathcap cultivator could need a finisher.   Every other card on that list either is a finisher of its own contributes to a beat down midrange plan or requires a beatdown plan to be much good. There is just little reason to build green into a control deck barring some minor cases of bluegreen clues I guess. But even then? why are you blue green clues? because you need a lot of card advantage? no clues already provides that. You want your finishers to be mana efficient and ideally to close the game.

If your opponent cant attack before you play the angel he cant attack after you play the angel UNLESS he can either trample through or go wide and push through lethal before his board depletes. Furthermore an aggro deck tends to not actually mind racing. Look mate. this is not a hard decision. Its literally a bomb mythic rare that completely cuts a color versus an above average uncommon that means passing a top  common in the same color. Its also not even remotely a unique opinion. People have at this point in the format published pick orders on the subject Note goldnight castigator better than any common in the set not quite as good as the best uncommon in the set.

8799364,0,t3_50lz1t,I think Im generally pretty positive about most things here and dont complain about many things. Im usually looking at things through a lens of even if I dont like this thats ok. Other people do and everything doesnt have to be for me in Magic. With that clarified this was the first LR podcast I didnt like. Ive been really bothered by the fact that since the announcement a bunch of people that didnt lose anything are telling everyone how great the leagues are by losing anything I mean that to them the draft leagues are all upside because they can use their normal queues if they want and draft league if they want instead. I was hoping theyd have an indepth discussion about the very real downsides for people that play only swiss queues that have lost their only means to draft a normal draft experience but it was really more of just a passing statement at the end about well this just sucks for you by Marshall at the end but I do appreciate that he at least acknowledged it which is more than what most content creators have done so far lsv included.Everyones been focusing on whether or not the draft leagues change how youre supposed to draft. Whether or not the variance is higher. Whether or not hate draft is more or less common. These things are just distractions from the main complaint though That there is a very real percentage of players perhaps not a large percentage but a percentage none the less that lost their only means of having their normal draft experience. They dont really care about the fractions of a percentage of EV alterations they just care that they can no longer start a queue with  people and play it out until theres a winner as one example. But aside from the this just sucks for you all of these people are ignoring that aspect and telling them not to worry their ev wont change much. Theres a large  of people that play Magic for the fun of it  not to maximize their ev  and nobody thats producing content seems to be giving that a thought at all.I was hoping LR  a podcast of people that its clear to see really do care about the community at large  would have a more holistic view of this situation instead of just arguing about the same EV style arguments like everyone else was doing. With that all said I really do appreciate everything you guys do and hope this came off more as a reasonable frustrationcriticism rather than just someone being mad on the internet. ,lrcast,d75katz,9,t5_330dh

8836707,0,t3_5180x5,Pretty sure the pick  Gavony Unhallowed is just incorrect.  Its a filler card you can get at any time of the draft and youre not really risking anything by speculating on the Subjugator Angel.Hating the Exultant Cultist late in pack  was also incorrect.  The Cultists Staff would have likely made the final cut in your deck and theres no reason to hate out a filler card for another deck when you can draft a card that will make your deck better.The same goes for Stensia Banquet in the very next pick.  Youre not playing blue and youre not likely to improve your chances of winning by hating the blue card.  Stensia Banquet may be bad but there are situations that come up where you wish you had more reach and thats exactly what that card provides.Breakneck Rider vs Malevolent Whispers is an interesting choice and though I cant fault you for taking the Rider I think you dismissed Whispers too quickly.  Aside from being a strong finisher you have the discard outlets to abuse its blowout potential when your opponent tries to alpha strike you in race situations.  Additionally most of your discard outlets are very aggressive Dragoons Supplicants so its very much a card that does exactly what you want to do while youre trying to get aggressive and close out a game.Senseless Rage vs Stormkirk Occultist I think youre way too focused on the vampire synergies and missing the fact that being able to turn an enchantment into a pump spell that sticks is an exceptionally strong effect.Im pretty sure cutting the Graf Rats from the final deck is just incorrect as well.  Its not strong on its own but the Meld card more than makes up for its weakness.  If youre going to cut creatures and you should because you have too many and not enough noncreature spells you should be chopping some of the other lowimpact creatures like Vampire Cutthroat and a Gavony Unhallowed because you dont need  of them in this deck.  Then you can run Borrowed Malevolence as your rd card.RG About halfway through the game you chose a very conservative play of just attacking with your  lifelinker when you had a  and  in play.  With your opponent at  life it seems the play here should be to sac the  and the land in your hand to Ruthless Disposal his  and  then cracking in with your remaining two creatures.  He either goes down to  or chumps with his  leaving him with no board.  Youre pretty much favored to win from this position especially since youre still sitting on the Dragoon in your hand.You were really happy about having Ruthless Disposal in your hand when Subjugator Angel came down but if youd killed his creatures a couple turns back hed be close enough to dead that you could just alpha strike another time or two and the body would be irrelevant.  He also wouldnt have had the opportunity to kill one of your creatures with that Ride Down because you would have been on the beatdown.RG  You should have Madnessed out the Twins precombat on your turn and swung in the air with the Dragoon for .  The opponent isnt cracking in with their s against your  anyway so the chances that youre going to ambush one of his creatures with an instant speed blocker are basically nil.  And if he does attack its because he has Ride Down again which you dont want to lose your  to anyway.After you got your second Mountain you decided not to play your second Dragoon because you might want to pitch it to Ruthless Disposal but if you throw it down youre threatening lethal next turn and you can pitch whatever card you draw without concern because youre just going to close out the game very very quickly.RG Your first opening hand is close enough to being actively good you only need  land to be in good shape and if that land is a mountain this hand becomes actively bonkers that pitching it is a bad idea.  There arent very many card hands that are better than this.RG Im pretty sure its a mistake to not swing in with your  against his .  If he chooses to trade youre trading up on mana cost your drop for his drop and it clears a path for your Occultist which cant currently attack with the Unhallowed in play.The turn when you played the Asylum Visitor you should have nuked the Bloodbriar off the board with your Incendiary Flow.  Putting aside the fact that he has a Terrarian in play which is going to immediately put the Bloodbriar out of kill range if you draw a land next turn you want to be able to drop it and empty your hand by hardcasting your Twins so you can start drawing an extra card off the Asylum Visitor the turn after.Overall It feels like you have a strong tendency toward conservative play which makes you miss those moments when being more aggressive would be the correct line and increase your chances of winning a game.,lrcast,d7a1q83,4,t5_330dh

8998581,0,t1_d7t1qjd,I honestly cant imagine playing the lookout with blue at all since blue looks like a  control color. I would be playing the   mana camel in blue way more than the lookout or the  that gives you  energy. Blue also has no tapuntap outlets meaning you will only be able to tap on attacks. I think Blue is going to be an energy deck usually. I would use the lookout with a lot of vehicles though especially Ovalchase Dragster  mana  crew  with haste and trample. That seems like a great combo youre going to be really pressuring their life points if you have the lookout on the board before turn . That would probably give you  damage and destroy a  mana creature. And Ovalchase is uncommon so you can actually hope to see it. I think in any draft I got Ovalchase dragster early I would lean towards black and make sure I get  or  night market lookouts.  You could turn it into a race and youll have a major advantage. And like you said the sky skiff combo is both likely being a  common card combo and nothing to sneeze at,lrcast,d7thndg,1,t5_330dh

9080225,0,t1_d82nvbe,Yeah I think youre still going to be taking less damage on average than the guaranteed perturn from a card like Phyrexian Arena which is an alltime awesome limited card.  Sure sometimes youll topdeck two lands with  counters and have to discard one and ping yourself but if I knew my next two draws were lands Id usually be pretty happy to pay a life and get rid of one anyway.  Its likely bad in blueblack because it isnt good with counterspells aether tradewinds and card draw spells but I think RB WB and GB all have aggressive shells that would really like this card and even in a midrangey deck its probably good as you are going to be hitting a ton of land drops and eventually playing something like a drop and a drop on the same turn if you havent already won by then.  Plus aggressive decks can use vehicles as their topend and those are mostly pretty cheap to cast.I ran it in the prerelease and it was great for me in a WB aggromidrange shell.  You have to watch out for conditional removal like Impeccable Timing but otherwise it gave me great results.  I once had to cast a Built to Last for no effect just to get it out of my hand but I dont even really consider that much of a downside since if I didnt have Midnight Oil on board I wouldnt have ever had the card in hand in the first place.,lrcast,d83ani0,1,t5_330dh

9128847,0,t1_d894p4p,I can get behind what youre saying.  On the Snare Thopter its certainly not some an amazing answer to Sky Skiff but I think its worth discussing.  What about drawing your Sky Skiff with an opposing Snare Thopter already in play?  What if it has gotten in for  or more damage?  You have to feel pretty bad IMO. It is true you can trade up however youre paying more of a cost than you may be aware of.  You already took some amount of damage and youre forced to tap down a creature on defense just to enable the chance of making this trade.  If your board is empty of creatures you may also not be ale to cast a creature and the Sky Skiff on the same turn eliminating the possibility of a trade for at least an entire turn cycle.  In other situations it may force you to hold back a ground creature you would like to be attacking with just to have a shot at taking down the Thopter next turn.  So yes you may come out ahead on mana but the Snare Thopter seems to almost always put the other player ahead in tempo.  Little side rant Even tempo changes like described here which dont seem earth shattering are often the difference between winning and losing.  When you are playing against a good playerdrafterdeck builder they are going to punish you for losing tempo or getting yourself into clunky situations.  If you look back on your games you will often find situations like these are the tipping point in lossesIm not saying all these cards make Sky Skiff bad or unplayable but I think a lot of them were not considered at all when originally looking at its value.  Also I think its worth pointing out that if you are the aggressive player an opposing Sky Skiff coming down to mirror your own is terrible for you as well.  That adds another common to the list.Basically while Sky Skiff isnt a bad card there are more situations where it is bad than people realize.  It is no where near an auto include or the insane valuecommon that many have hyped it up to be.,lrcast,d895b1c,-1,t5_330dh
9139588,0,t3_55h3wy,I know you say mana wasnt an issue but when youve got removal spells in the board that are still pretty good I dont think its worth splashing especially in a pretty aggressive deck.

Its definitely faster when Im just hitting F to move on but Im really going to have to get used to correctly using the buttons for F and F so that I dont accidentally skip my turn.

9631722,0,t3_5cqxsr,Overall this deck is a few built to smashes and artifact creatures short of being a solid RW aggro deck.PP artist over puzzleknot. Its just a much better card.PP Gremlins over Built to Last. Youve got several red cards and only one white card which is itself also red.PP Built to Smash over Pyrohelix. Its just a better card. An aggressive deck with a bunch of Smashes and some cheap soso artifact creatures can be awesome.PP Sky Skiff over Gorger. You shouldnt play the Gorger and the Sky Skiff goes OK with Gremlins and Smashes.PP Grubs over Fanatic. The Grubs are just much better it doesnt get bricked by a servo.PP Monitor over Gremlins.

Lots of overlaps in guild synergiesstrategies between the Ravnica blocks same with tribalstrategies in the Innistrad blocks. Personally I think RAVRTR would be fine and wouldnt worry about design philosophy differences. Looking back at the set it stands out as an older set that holds up particularly well by modern standards. Those three block pairs all seem well suited to the project. ZENBFZ looks a lot tougher to pull off as a lot of the Eldrazi stuff doesnt lend itself to the combination wanting ingestcolorless creatures mattercolorless mana mattersfatties matter.

OTOH Im happy to have one in the sideboard of an aggro deck and am quick to consider bringing it in if the matchup is right. Mostly that means going up against decks with fewer larger creatures especially if it looks like the games could be a race and Im on the play.

So in this instance two of the SBA checks are met you have below  or less life and a creature has damage equal to or greater than its toughness marked on it. So simultaneously you would destroy the creature and lose the game were it not for the angels replacement effect. So instead you are simultaneously destroying the Angel going to twenty life and exiling the Angel. Since these all happen simultaneously the angels controller gets to decide which of any contradictory effects actually happen.Edit Apparently this is rule . based on todays rules updates not actually a change to the rule but they changed the example to use the Angel.,lrcast,dco2f9y,1,t5_330dh

Do you feel like you are getting better?Ill add that while by most games standards a year is a long time by Magic standards you are still a relatively new player. And on top of that you are playing a format in draft that tends to be on the more difficult side of the Magic spectrum since it involves a wider range of skills drafting deck building and play and is in constant flux i.e. every three months you are learning a new format and every draftdeck is different.

11471531,0,t1_dfvn4yd,I think itll depend on how viable blue control is.  Youll play U Sorcery Draw  in most any blue control deck and this is strictly better than that.  The blue Cartouche works well with it too because it keeps you cycling through your deck and flying is often a win condition for blue control decks.How good green is will also depend on how fast the format is.  If we see the game start on turn  more often than not a  is no better off than a  for attacking since they both trade down for a bear anyway.Although if were looking strictly at which enchantments encourage you to play more Cartouches were probably looking at RgtGgtBgtUgtW.  Red and green can completely take over the board by generating virtual card advantage over the course of a game.  Black can do the same but is a bit narrower due to being an edict effect.  Blue obviously gains more card advantage but theres only so many times in a game you want to take off a turn to draw more cards.

11669926,0,t1_dgfu05p,Yeah Illusory Wrappings straight up kills Soulstinger Defiant Greatmaw or Exemplar of Strength if they put the counters on themselves. Plus a couple of the rares. Worth keeping in mind. Seems good against the greenblack  counters deck.Doomed Dissenter  Festering Mummy plus the afformentioned GB  counter creatures feels a lot like the Exploit deck from Dragons of Tarkir. ,lrcast,dgisvm1,2,t5_330dh

11691108,0,t3_66t6hm,gtIts going to be hard to play with and against this card and it gets significantly better once you add more removal to the mix. Imagine the opponent with a  and a  and you bounce or kill the  end of turn. Untapping and casting Riches is a beating and that scenario doesnt seem unbelievable at all.This feels pretty best case scenario mentality to me.  I feel like its way more likely your opponent will have a valid choice that makes spending  mana on Mind Control feel horrible.,lrcast,dgl7e9p,3,t5_330dh

11755208,0,t3_67q3cj,I feel ya  MTGO is super addicting especially if the cost isnt an issue either because youve got the money or because youre good enough to be infinite or nearinfinite. I used to be into video games in general but now I basically find them all boring and unfulfilling when compared with MTGO.Ive found that I have to pretty much go cold turkey in order to stop and I kind of go through cycles where Im playing a lot or not playing at all. A good time to do it is when a new set comes out. I find the appeal to jump back in is lessened when Im not familiar with the current limited environment because the random urge to log on and jump in a queue is countered by the fact that Ill probably get smoked because I dont know the format. Other than that I dont have a ton of advice that stems from personal experience but here are some thoughts anyways In theory draft leagues should help. Instead of having to devote  hours you just need  minutes. It allows you to split a draft into  chunks potentially  the draft portion and up to  matches  so you could try to make a rule that you only do one draft or one match per day. I say in theory though because yeah easier said than done. You say normal pastimes like TV shows or movies or books... I think you need to find stuff that gets you away from screens and out of the house and most importantly involves other people. Its a lot easier to not play MTGO when youre out of the house doing stuff with other people than when youre  feet away from your computer reading a book or watching tv. Paper magic could be a solution... gets you out of the house is social. However it also might leave you wanting for the better competition and more efficient use of time that MTGO provides. There are support groups and other resources out there for video game addiction and addiction in general. MTGO kinda falls under video game addiction and as you said gambling addiction as well I would think. Some of the people that need those resources the most are of course in much worse shape than you are and have a really serious problem but I imagine they would be helpful no matter your level of addiction.,lrcast,dgshdnj,2,t5_330dh
11772005,0,t3_67mv1c, comments  .  The frosting on the crap cupcake that is Throne of the GodPharoah is the only place it could possibly end up seeing play in a normal set is a heavy token deck...and the only tokens you can easily make a large number of are  Warriors...with VIGILANCE..  One thing with momentum is doing better might not necessarily lead to momentum but getting several good results in a row could be an indicator that a player has figured out some key to improving their play.  Like if a player who was okay at limited and good at constructed levels up their limited play theyll probably see a momentum streak at their next few pro tours.,lrcast,dgue00d,4,t5_330dh
11773522,0,t3_67zwc7,I agree with your analysis except that I would have leaned the other way. Bonepicker has been fantastic foragainst me and I think there are enough fast decks out there that having a high impact play early is a priority. ,lrcast,dguk9m9,1,t5_330dh

11802926,0,t3_68eio3,It would help if your deck was actually sorted by CMC. Im not really sure what order you have your cards in here.Ive found it helpful to sort Cycle cards by their Cycle cost essentially thinking Whats the earliest I could do something with this card? That means on turn  you can cycle Greater Sandworm and then your  drop slot is empty. I tend to put Aftermath cards in the same column as the CMC of the first half too.As for going allin on an archetype theres a difference between having a plan and having an expectation wishful thinkinghoping. Getting all BG  cards in packs  and  is great but come pack  you may not see any because others are picking the cards or they simply arent in the packs. Having a plan doesnt mean sticking to your archetype it just means knowing what youre trying to do with your deck. If you see a mediocre card in your archetype but better creature in one of your two colors fill the spots you need to fill. It hurts letting a synergistic card pass by but if you need to fill spots you need to fill spots.,lrcast,dgxwi8e,5,t5_330dh
11809461,0,t1_dgyfza1,Addressed mummies on another comment but with  untappers Id prefer to have the Spearmaster. This deck always wants to be exerting on turn  they help me get there but a big body might be a good idea.,lrcast,dgyn690,1,t5_330dh
