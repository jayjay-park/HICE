2973329,0,t3_2u8goo, nedkrelly in rpoliticsrpoliticscommentsuwmlcodi?contextNot all killing is murder. Calling one killing a murder when not applicable is a simple attempt at inflaming emotions. Unless of course you are arguing that every time a state executes an inmate they are also committing murder. Same with a felon who pulls a gun on a cop. Cop shoots felon apparently he murdered him? If you honestly believe a  month old fetus is the same thing as a  year old child then Iampxm guessing the room you took your science lessons in had dirt floors. Also probably a chapter on identifying witches. ,RemovedComments,co62zx7,1,t5_366fa

By abolishing all types of offensive weaponry and stopping strikes in conflict countries we stop being the respected force that we are to the people that need our help not our enemies. The same way hungry people need us to provide food aid oppressed people need our help to provide a life with less fear and risk. I understand that military action is not always the answer but when in conflict with radicalism a peaceful attempt to help the local people will simply get you killed. ,RemovedComments,co82vdy,1,t5_366fa

War is an ugly thing but not the worst of things. ampquotNonWarampquot is far worse in my opinion. Hoping it would just all turn out OK didnampxt work in Libya... and it hasnampxt worked in Syria either. We have sat and watched  die and millions flee to live in desert camps or other countries. We again supply untrained and unaccountable militias with weapons in hopes they... I donampxt even know. Overthrow both ISIS and Assad?The Bush Doctrine made many mistakes. Intent to provide a solution was never one of those mistakes. The intent to be responsible for removing a dictator and restoring stability to the region was always the mission.The Obama Doctrine seems to be that if we bomb the region enough and fill it with enough guns and as long as we never put a ampquotboot on the groundampquot... everything will just work itself out.Well? Has it all just worked itself out? Or have we sat and watched ISIS grow in Syria since  untill they invaded out ally Iraq in ? Have we sat and watched Libya become the new Mad Max movie? Has a single moment of the Obama Doctrine actually worked? Is there any part of that doctrine that is aimed toward an end goal? How long have we been bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria now?  months? ? What is that end goal?President Obama has never answered those questions with any specificity. I believe that is because he has no intention of trying to bring any stability or end to the conflict. He will be very happy to hand the mess over to the next President.,RemovedComments,co8n01o,1,t5_366fa
