76875,0,t3_1lx6vf,Yes. Especially if theres pressure for the interaction to go well from me or circumstances. It makes relationships with my boyfriends longterm friends and roommates more draining because I want them to like me I want to take care of them and I want my boyfriend to be happy.

171144,0,t3_1w1ty5,You might spend more time reaffirming others of their successes as ENFJ feel they need to do. You take such a vested interest in how others are doing of course itll overshadow how great youre doing.Think of it this way both your success and their success are the same size buildings. Youre interested in the other building and you are drawn closer to it. When you look up at their building it looks big because of how close you are to it but when you look at yours it appears smaller because of your perspective.Thats the way I feel at least.,enfj,cexxcg3,9,t5_2r36p

Though I see that actually reasoning grounded in emotion is likely far more dangerous. But I am truly jealous of those who can make a decision and then not agonize over it emotionally.. my life would be far easier if I could do that!I feel just the same about the second part.

6490601,0,t3_4462ov,Yeah Im very similar in that regard. Asking people questions and carrying conversations to get them to that state of Finally someone understandscaresseesetc me! Validation? is something I actively try to do for people Im interested in and tend to get very deflated when it isnt reciprocated in the slightest. Ive heard life stories from their biggest fears and worries to their dreams and hopes of people who dont ask a single thing about me. At my worst I attribute it to them not really caring who validated them they got theirs so fuck everything else. At my best I understand they figure I have all my shit together and thats all they need to know about me.It feels awkward having to find little ways to weave in bits of yourself into the conversation and then having to rationalize it with This is just so they understand where my opinion is coming from! or something to that effect. Feels like a weird dance with yourself of almost feeling guilty giving data about yourself as if it is unimportant to the context of the conversation! and then giving yourself reasons to NOT feel guilty about it. An endless onetwo step that requires a third party to step in. The issue I run into in circumstances like these are my care levels drop incredibly quickly because Im forced to utilize my engines for myself. This means that whoever the other party is does not help me in being my best or what I perceive to be my best and I will very likely axe them from my life making me come across as a bit of an ass. ,enfj,czqod8p,2,t5_2r36p

6720660,0,t3_47nkkq,Fun! Inc Wall of Text.  Have you looked at functions yet?  They are the best way to tell. Heres my favorite page that kind of explains what theyre about.  ENFJs and ENFPs have COMPLETELY different ones.ENFJFeNiSeTiENFPNeFiTeSiFunctions can be more than a bit confusing at first.  Let me go wall of text mode in an attempt to explain because I think theyre the most fascinating part of MBTI.  As an ENFJ were Fe dominant.  We often start this way as children.  Some of us with worse childhoods who dont learn to express Fe will be very Ti heavy children.  Those kids look like INTPs when theyre young. Often in our teen years we start to see the world differently and abstractly which is our auxillary Ni kicking in.  A magical perspective shift happens and you realize you have this new way of thinking.  As you head into your s you start noticing shapes colors sounds and things like that bus thats about to hit you better than you did before.  ltSe  Also it kind of augments your Fe you start noticing other peoples emotions better than ever.  An ENFP on the other hand has Ne to help them notice things and patterns at an earlier age.If youre an ENFJ your inferior function is Ti and as it develops you might find yourself able to keep a more level head in a crisis.  Also math problems.  I kind of guiltily enjoy doing math problems but still would never do them unless someone made me.  Your last function sort of balances you out as a person.I imagine an ENFP would be a rather random child probably darn good at arguing with adults Ne? and as they hit their teen years there would be a really good chance of feelings and values kicking in. Fi  ltYour soul becomes one solid good vibe you start championing weird causes...  In your s your Te would probably start to develop.  Id guess it would mean that you would be better at making solid plans and just generally absorbing data which would work with your Ne.  Si would probably manifest as a weird sense of nostalgia because its all about accumulated past memories.  ENFJs dont really have this one because Ni fills in for it.  Instead of really remembering what happened to me in the past my subconscious fills in the gaps.  Ex I cant remember that exact quote.  I can just remember the idea of it and how to rephrase it. Si or Se is one of the most noticable differences between the types.  I like Se colors shapes sounds.  Sometimes to practice this I like to sit in my room and try to soak in my environment like a sponge.  Its mentally exhausting yet rewarding.Just on first impression to me you sound like an ENFP!   The fact that you say you remain fixated on the past screams Si.  I worry about the future Ni probably its pretty future oriented before I go to sleep instead.  I should probably stop writing this and do that!  Most of the things you said really could apply to both types though.  For having wildly different functions we can look pretty similar on the surface. xDAlso with the whatif chain of ideas!  This also screams ENFP because thats a very Ne sort of concept.  We could create a box...Also also I dont generally steer conversations unless I feel like they are going somewhere depressing.  If theyre just about something boring the other person is clearly very interested in I just get quiet and listen.  ENFPs seem to be more prone to getting bored with other peoples BS. Let me know if this helped!  ... Theres a ton of info online about MBTI functions...,enfj,d0eh32a,4,t5_2r36p
6742469,0,t3_47my4g,I feel for you so much right now! Im so sorry this terrible thing happened to you. Think to yourself and accept that you were not the issue and that you did not deserve this to happen to you. You have been nothing but good to her and she took you for granted. You truly deserve better. It is incredibly hard dealing with such a betrayal especially from the person that you cared about the most. My best advice is to not be afraid of the feelings of sadness and grief because essentially you have lost someone close to you in a terrible way. Allow yourself to feel these feelings just cry it out. Crying does help and is how your body responds naturally to negative emotion. Then when you pull yourself together find some sort of distraction  a healthy one. Exercise remember to eat find a fun activity outside of the house to do. Do not lock yourself away for days. If you do youll find yourself spiraling down rather than picking yourself up again. Find solace in close friends or family. Talk about your feelings to them. They are there for you and care about you. And finally when it comes to the time of facing the consequences of her actions make sure she knows how much she hurt you  but do not be resentful and do not express anger physically. Behave in a graceful manner  take the high road. You will feel better for it in the end and the message to her will come out so much clearer. She must understand that what she did was in no way acceptable because in her mind she was doing what she wanted and decided that cheating on you was okay. After talking to her simply cut her out of your life. It will be hard but itll be better for you because you do not need toxic people in your life. Instead seek with all your strength the people in your life who you can trust who care about you and who will be there for you. This is one of those moments in life where you learn who your real friends are. All the best with everything and you are welcome on this thread any time! We are here for you  stay strong!,enfj,d0gq8y4,2,t5_2r36p

I feel like i type more as an ENFP as back in high school I used to type as an EXFP but somehow i seem to have developed my J?? Im also a gamer.. used to play tons of D. I need my downtime and I get reclusive and moody too could be my cancer sign though. I cant focus on completing one task I get bored and start on another task which I also cant complete and go back to the first task. I go to and fro till I get them perfect before being able to say they are both complete. Say for example excel spreadsheets at work.

Its a whole lot of love.  Ive been trying to work on selfcompassion and acceptance because I think thats the root of my issues with trusting mennot being able to commit to anyone who is interested in me... I just dont trust that they care for me anywhere near as much as Im capable of caring for them.But this isnt necessarily just a bad thing either.

7669939,0,t1_d3e0s9z,Welcome home to Fe world! Ive seen you mentioning the snap decisionmaking twice. Can you give some real life examples?For instance are you talking about when we are so dead certain whether or not we like will date someone at first glance?Im not sure if youre referring to the ability to be so intuitive which I think Ni users like INFJ ENFJ all have or the ability to be so DARING as to follow our intuition which may be more Fedom ENFJ related.In my particular example above ENFJs will be able to make snap decisions because the Dom Fe makes us good with evaluating our people and this evaluation is supported by Aux Ni.Regardless I think there is value to being cautious and patient. Snap decisionmaking may not be the best. In an ENFJs case if it is snap decisionmaking that is not people related it may be more inaccurate career choices everyday decisions not very Fe related  it will come off as impulsive. I do realise that Nidoms are slow to decide which isnt necessarily a bad thing. Additionally slow is inaccurate word. I think most Nidoms already know their answers from the beginning but need that little push and unambiguous certainty before confirming their decisions.

8474686,0,t3_4vr4ip,I am a theist of the Universalistinformedbyprocesstheology ilk. For me the spiritual journey has always been central  and I spent my s sowing my spiritual oats in various forms of Christianity and paganism which led me to Unitarian Universalism about  years ago and to ministry in the last decade. Edited to answer the why in your question for me spirituality is about how we understand ourselves as human beings interacting with that which we dont understand  whether we call it God or the collective unconscious or something else entirely  we get the feeling theres a part of us that is beyond biology and many of us consider this part of ourselves the soul. As an ENFJ I feel like my drive to understand and help others has to include our souls as well as our minds and bodies. To me ignoring the spiritual  even in atheists  would be anathema to how I understand my cognitive functions and thus my call to ministry. ,enfj,d60vl7f,4,t5_2r36p

8548238,0,t1_d63r80a,Hmm we might be working with different definitions of sympathy and empathy? Sympathy is kind of more like pity you feel bad for their suffering vs. feeling their suffering whereas empathy is feeling what others feel. Fe is by definition empatheticwe pick up on and can feel what our environment feels which is why ENFJs hate conflict can appeal to the emotions of others and tend to be more caretakery. Fidoms however would use sympathy instead of empathy because Fi by definition is not subjected to outside valueswell unless they validate their own. Thats not to say that INFPs for example are not ever empathetic but when they are theyd be engaging Fe. An Fi user feeling compassion for your suffering would be relating it to their own values and experiences. An extreme and probably not so helpful example is me and my lovely INFP friend talking about villainry. I could look at a criminal on trial and immediately regret the emotional turmoil they must be going though whereas my INFP friend doesnt have that reaction. She might say something like well they did a really bad thing so they probably deserve it or yeah I agree I would never want to go to jail for something like that which are sympathybased statements. Sometimes its quite hard to tell the difference. I dont really think one is objectively better than the other though I think some people prefer empathy because it seems to validate how they might feel but thats a whole nother topic. Finally this whole empathy business seems kind of selfperpetuating. HighFe types really dig validation cuz dats how empathetic people do. tldr I think were operating on contrasting definitions Fe by nature is empathetic and Fiusers use sympathy. ,enfj,d6a3o20,1,t5_2r36p
8595882,0,t1_d6fmisu,This hits home so hard. I can often feel slighted by things that seem so obvious to me but which the other person doesnt seem to recognize. I get stuck in my head thinking this is important to me but its stupid I know it is but it also means something but if I tell him... no its too stupid and irrational to tell him he should just know! But if its irrational why should he already know? Because if he cared as much as I do he just would. He must not care as much as I do! and oh my god that is a horrible place to be.And then I send an apologetic message because I dont want to lose this person who is important to me. But its really like a  apology because I still feel hurt and slighted need the other person to meet me halfway and try to recognize what is going on. ANd more importantly I need him to show me that he didnt mean it. But not in a logical fashion. Of course I can make the logical connections but thats not what Im after... Its like you mean this much to me... can you just comfort me instead of making excuses? Because thats what I need. I need to know you didnt mean it and youll consider my feelings next time and that the reason youre even putting up with me right now is because you really care about me.Its a mess.I hope you guys are able to work things out.

Fair enough it was more of a passing thought anyways. And yea you guys are literally amazing how you can read people and react. Its always impressed me. Wish you guys werent so rare lol. I will say I had a pretty good discussion with my brother today. Gave me a little insight. He seemed to respond best when I hit the point that INTPs have Fe as its last function and that in general we have good intentions. We just dont really show it very well through the filter of everything else. I guess for a lot of types they see us as negative. A lot of his feelings came from that. And repetitive misunderstands I think made him just believe I was naturally spiteful. With this understanding it amazes me he hasnt disowned me as a family member yet but yea the direct approach was fairly easier then I thought.

Suicide runs in my moms side of the family  there have been several according to a cousin as well as narcissism. Being raised by my mom destroyed him and he wasnt able to overcome it. I was really suicidal after finding him I spent  months drinking every night so Id be too scared of messing up and becoming a vegetable to actually go through with anything. Those months changed me and I know now that Ill be able to make it through anything. If I ever decide to take my own life I know it will be because Im ready to go and not out of despair. My best friend is an INFJT so seeing your username made me think of her and smile. She used to suffer from severe anxiety but I had her start taking mg of ltheanine several times a day and its helped her immensely. It helped me through the worst of my grieving process as well.,enfj,d7xpun4,1,t5_2r36p

9418380,0,t1_d99ri6e,Arent I making the situation about myself when I make one of those empathic responses? Am I not taking focus away from their pain and saying Hey I hurt too. It sounds selfcentered.,enfj,d99ufat,1,t5_2r36p
9622074,0,t3_5c5xo4,I love this thread. Im the one who happily upvoted everyone to two points because Im having such a great time.I am mostly deaf in one ear. I dont like to share that as an immediate fact about myself in person but if people find out it makes for an interesting conversation piece i guess  in large crowds Im useless especially with music playing I just do shots and smile.I am also a musician pianist and work with headphones and having to hear many small details in a piece of music every day. It is incredibly frustrating. Im switching my headphones constantly. I hate hard panned stuff because I do feel the vibrations against the dud ear and it kindof.... Tickles for lack of a better word.I had to do some recording engineer work in college and was complimented on my panning skills actually  I just followed the numbers on the screen hehe,enfj,d9z4abh,2,t5_2r36p

9756310,0,t3_5ew4li,Try to dissect every thought you get in a way that makes logical sense to you and try your best avoiding Fes influence in this. Thoughts like does this make sense? Why does it make sense? Why is this how it is? How did it become this way? What does it exist of? are very helpful in this.As for activities I like creating and understanding the systems in things such as MBTI. It might be a bit Sis fault but I think a large portion of why I enjoy learning about it is because of Ti as well. Maybe make a new language system using complicated symbols instead of our letters for fun? Or get to the bottom of how chess works? Or perhaps play some Pokemon theres a fairly easy system in the battle mechanics using types and attacks and individual stats. You can play it competitive against other people online for free on Showdown It might take a little while before you understand it fully if youre not already a Pokemon fan but its definitely fun to do imo. ,enfj,dafom97,3,t5_2r36p
9818616,0,t1_danap9d,Yes I agree..the confusion part is very true. Ill say something snd he wont say anything...he thinks a little..and then hell say something else.. just to be okay with it. But its fine... I tease him about it.. call it the Momentary Pause like he is processing. Even I have moments where I dont know what to say to something he does. Bit I think we are quick to respond and we drift the conversation out to fluffy skies. I like how diffenrt both types are...like even tho Se is our rd function and their nd... there is so much diffenrce. Like the way he gets so excited with graphics or aesthetic stuff. Hahah its cute. While Im like.. yeah.. its cool. Once I sent him a video of me fooling around at an amusement park and he kept watching it many times...which I found cute..but..if I were him.. Id watch it maximum  times and leave it for the day. Things like that. And I like how they feel sensations to a whole new level.  Its like it gets them soo happy... its contagious to others. Haha okay Ill stop now I ranted a lot. Have a nice day. ,enfj,dandu68,1,t5_2r36p

10116603,0,t1_dbowpha,Hi really appreciate this comment and what you have said in terms of reading and writing this is something that I have started to do. I guess I havent really summarized myself up yet or where I want to be. I have done so much reading of late I often get overwhelmed with ideas and thoughts especially when Im analyzing myself and start becoming indecisive and looking at so many different paths. Originally I went for the job in SEA working in financesales for the expected big bucks but soon realized it just wasnt for me or that wasnt the way I wanted to go about it.   ,enfj,dbq792y,2,t5_2r36p

10377654,0,t1_dckcsno,Can you apologize and ask her out to dinner? Just let her in on your insecurity and how you feel that you messed up but that you are trying to learn how to do better and dont know how. Basically exactly what youve written here. ENFJ here that would win simple points with me. ,enfj,dckdd04,3,t5_2r36p

11148196,0,t3_5z6i6w,Despite their statements to the contrary the author does not seem to be a fan of the type. I feel like they just cannot conceive thay these actions are truly genuine that they must be a put on an act of some sort. I harrumphed a lot about that. But Tom seems like the kind of dude I would love to chill with. ,enfj,devmwqj,1,t5_2r36p
11191898,0,t3_5zs5sk,Ive also only just realised that I can be quite judgemental and have a rigid standard that I hold people but mostly myself accountable to. When the reality is that theres no one right way of social engagement!! ,enfj,df0l711,6,t5_2r36p

11525291,0,t1_dg2daj9,Thanks so much for your insightful reply. It was a little hard to read because it essentially confirms my worst fears. We do work through our differences well but there are quite a few of them which worries me. And youre right the things I wish would be different are part of his core identity. Im just hoping some people have made it work and I can learn something from them. ,enfj,dg2e6kp,1,t5_2r36p
