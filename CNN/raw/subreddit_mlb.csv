191981,0,t3_1w9y89,It makes zero sense for organizations to offer rich multiyear deals to pasttheirprime players.  When they do the organization almost always takes a haircut.  Remember how Albert Pujols was reportedly insulted when the Cardinals made him a year offer even though he was  years old.  Turns out the Cardinals dodged a bullet.  Think the Yankees regret their deal with ARod?  The Lakers may have been loyal to Kobe by offering a big money year extension to a  yearold player returning from a major injury but from a financial standpoint it was exceptionally stupid.  Ortiz has been freakishly productive for a player past  but how long can he be expected to hold up?

It was a pain in the ass getting to the stadium and once I was there I felt like Id rather be at a bar or a lecture about the intricacies of basket weaving. The stadium sucks the area sucks the majority of the people in attendance that werent there to see the visiting team looked like they were being held against their will. It sucks because the Rays have some great die hard fans but the idiot soccer mom types that show up for playoff games with those fucking cowbells give the die hards a black eye. Im never an advocate for moving teams but neither Florida city deserves the teams they have. Miami fans cry all the time that its ownerships fault for having fire sales every other year or the stadium sucked but when they won the world series they had trouble selling tickets to those games and had entire sections empty the following seasons. Miami as a city royally screwed themselves by giving that team a new stadium. Tampa would be shooting itself in the foot if it did the same. The Rays need to move possibly to Charlotte or Montreal keeping themselves in the AL east. Montreal would be great giving Toronto an instant rival and theres been tons of interest in bringing baseball back. ,mlb,ci7cqkb,1,t5_2qrrr

While a few subpar offensive seasons could lower his career average I think that would be largely cancelled out by the increased HR and RBI total. Also want to point out that Player A doesnt have to be better than Player B to make it to the HoF over him. Its not a reward for talent its a reward for production.

1606161,0,t3_2chv5j,I see so many things wrong with everything you say lets see Interest of expansion based on exhibition games being held somewhere or MLB having an office?. No. That is not how it works or why they have held games in places such as Australia Japan Mexico or Europe...  More teams in Canada? And one in Montreal again? Remember the Expos?  No expansion south of the border? Monterrey Mexico was a strong candidate for getting the Expos franchise back in the day and geographically and populationwise it makes sense. By any chance do you think that the banditos are running rampart in the streets over there?... Speaking of being geographically oblivious you should go and search a map comparison of Europe vs the USA. Europe is all cramped up together. Distances from one country to another are short. Distance from LA to NY? Just short of  miles. Distance from Lisbon to Vienna? Just short of  miles. I also see you added a team for San Juan. The distance from Miami to SJ is close to  miles. Scheduling would be brutal or would have to be shortened or the season expanded a lot. There are few rest days in the season and well you brought up soccer. Well soccer is way more physically demanding... Those guys play just once or twice a week which allows them to accommodate better for travel and resting. Capital cities have nothing to do with anything. Washington didnt have a team for a long time. So saying that Canadas capital city should have a team because the US one does... same argument stands for Mexico. It would make more sense to have a team in the north than further south. MLB itself is one of the reasons why pro baseball wont grow as much anywhere else. They have the economical power to attract the top talent from everywhere in the world and besides Japan I cant really think of any league that comes even close. They even have everything in place to scout and develop young talent all over Latin America with baseball schools and camps. Those kids dream of playing in the majors like their idols not in the local teams.  Most pro leagues have international player caps. As far as I know baseball and mlb do not. Even Japan has a current  international player limit on their roster. These rules are what makes it possible to have local leagues. ,mlb,cjhmhle,2,t5_2qrrr

1978731,0,t1_ckr68n2,if there were ever a comment that picked and chose nonsensical comparisons to make a point this would be it.   Bobby Abreu?  Bobby Abreu was a fantastic offensive player for much of his career his rapid decline booted him from the exclusive ... club and if he werent such a trainwreck of a defensive player for most of his career at one of the weakest defensive positions on the field corner outfield then he would have been a Hall of Famer. I just dont see how any sort of rational person could compare Jeters slugging over  games to the slugging percentage of outfielders who have played not even half of the games Jeter played in his career.  Cody Ross?  Cody Ross has played  seasons in his career of  games or more and Jeters best slugging seasons were better than Rosses.  Rosses career slugging is a tick above Jeters which include playing through  years old and Ross pales in the other rate stats.   Ross has the exact same career slugging percentage as Cal Ripken Jr.  May as well compare them.  I guess Cal is only probably a Hall of Famer.Fernando Tatis played in  games once.  I am a huge Yankees fan but have always been realistic about Jeters production throughout his career.  But this comparison borders on lunacy.  Whats next?  Albert Pujols wasnt so great because he had fewer career stolen bases than Dee Gordon?,mlb,ckrmyn5,1,t5_2qrrr

When something has happened only  times in the  year history of baseball winning both Cy Young and MVP i dont think its all that outlandish to see it happen when something like Kershaws season crosses from the Excellent to Historic....its time to start talking about more hardware.And for the record considering the amount of time missed by Stanton its actually a smaller  of games missed than Kershaw who missed  starts in aprilmay.

This has been a point of emphasis for years in my High School Association and umpires who prioritize pace of play rules generally see games  minutes shorter than those who let the batters wander around and take their time. Also just because the batters cant leave the box doesnt mean the umpire will let the pitcher pitch before they get a sign. The batter can still stall a second or two to disrupt the pitchers rhythm they just cant walk halfway back to the dugout and readjust all their armor and gloves and helmet in between every pitch David OrtizNomar come to mind. ,mlb,cpk6vhg,6,t5_2qrrr

Proper fielding techniques approaches at the plate how to pitch even are all things that get taught at a the Single A and Double A levels. A  year old kid generally just hasnt had the time to learn all of these things and master them to a major league ready level. Ive talked with guys who played in the minors the average day was  hours of working on baseball even after being in the minors for a few years. There is a lot of development work that goes into becoming a major league baseball player which is different from football in that it could take a year to learn a pro system and that player being strong enoughfast enough could succeed. In baseball the strongestfastest arent always the best players. ,mlb,cs203wd,1,t5_2qrrr

Im a pretty competitive person as well nothing like what I think Harvey is but if I was told you have to limit myself to make sure I get  million or I could win a World Series this year and pitch  innings there would have to be a lot of thinking going on. Really this sucks for him. If the Mets talent waited one more year to fully develop and you guys were irrelevant until next year everyone would love Harvey forever most likely. But since all this is happening at once hes the villian to you guys. I dont get it. Hes not just saying I dont want to pitch for you guys. Hes got an actual dilemma here. Go pitch your heart out and try to win the World Series which is not a guarantee and maybe contribute to some future injuries or take it easy so your can ease back into a full season like most doctors suggest your first year back from TJ surgery.

EDIT What a bunch of cunts in this thread stroking their online outrage. Typical modern redditor downvote and dont discuss. Its so very clearly a mistake by the fan but everyones looking for a reason to be mad at someone nowadays. Yeah hes a Redsox fan. Whats he doing there? He couldve gotten the tickets free from work. Yeah he yells at Gonzalez AFTER its over. He couldve been yelling My bad bro or something to that effect. No one in this thread knows what really went down and is just angry for the sake of being angry. The look on that guys face makes me think it was simply a mistake.

Papelbon apparently takes offense to this probably because he cost them the game the night before and the game of the incident as well and flat out attacks Harper.

Personally I think that all baseball should be played with wood and arguments about durability of wood is no longer really valid in the age of maple composite wood and bamboo bats. Metal may last longer than even those modern wood bats but a  metal bat is not going to last x longer than a  composite bat. Metal bats have more pop but with the newish bbcore standards the difference isnt that big. ,mlb,d1raetg,3,t5_2qrrr

8680671,0,t3_4yv7e5,If you love football you are probably very knowledgeable about the plays and strategy. Baseball doesnt have many plays per se but one of the things I enjoy is that all players in the field basically have algorithms for what to do when the ball is hit to them and what to do if the ball is hit to someone else. It should be automatic. While it may seem like only the people fielding or catching the ball are involved lets call it the primary play in a given play all the other players on the field are moving somewhere in anticipation of what might happen lets call this the secondary play...when stuff goes wrong.A simple example Nobody on base. Batter hits a ground ball to the shortstopthird baseman side of the field. Both players move towards the ball with the third baseman playing it if possible because his momentum will be moving towards first base making the throw easier. Whomever doesnt play the ball will be close in case it is misplayed say it bounces off the glove and lands only a few feet away. The first baseman goes to first base to prepare to receive the throw. So what should other players do or prepare to do? Here are a few things The left fielder runs in so he can play the ball if the shortstop missed it. The catcher starts running down the first baseline to backup the first baseman in case the throw is bad and gets past him. The right fielder should also be coming in to backup the throw to first. The second baseman will head for second base because if the shortstop misses the ball the runner might try to go to second base so he needs to be there receive a throw from the left fielder. The centre fielder moves inward preparing to backup any throw to second base if the first baseman misses the throw from the shortstop or third baseman moving to his left or right as needed depending on which side the throw is coming from. If the ball were to get to the left fielder and the runner tries to go to second base he should be telling the left fielder this is happening. The pitcher goes to cover home plate since the catcher has vacated it.You can see there is a lot going on even though it might just look like a simple ground ball to the shortstop and throw to first. Now you might not see each player move to a large degree like the catcher isnt always going to sprint up the first base line but those actions are in their minds.As you can imagine the algorithms grow in complexity as the game situation does number of men on base number is outs where the ball is hit the score the inning the count on the batter etc... ,mlb,d6qpi12,5,t5_2qrrr

Another black lie. How many times can you keep defending this?Evidence also shows his finger prints on the weapon keep in mind since he is a convicted felon he is not legally allowed to own a weapon and walking around with the weapon in your hand and out of the holster after repeatedly being told to drop it would be brandishing anyway.Also she was yelling Keith dont you do it! Keith dont you do it!

They have never had a single complaint however because the Spokane Tribe is intimately involved with upper executives in logo planning promos jerseyshats printed in Salish and a big section of the concourse featuring a historical museum expo. There are TONS of tribes in the area many of those schools chose to call themselves the Indians Braves Redskins Tribe Chieftains etc. I will admit there is a pretty big optics problem tho for professional teams more than high schools on reservations. Since I grew up in a heavily native area all these complaints are coming as a big surprise to me. If you suggested to Wellpinit High School they should change their name...theyd laugh you out of their building. The logo is pretty dumb. But the name isnt derogatory for Cleveland. Just like the Yankees isnt derogatory. Or the Tigers. Team mascots are shows of respect and acknowledgement of that brings fearless nature in the face of adversity.
