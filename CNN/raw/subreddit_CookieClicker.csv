600111,0,t1_cg87k17,Its not that simple. Numbers in JavaScript are doubleprecision floating point  bit. The maximum is a bit larger than .  However as numbers grow larger the gaps between successive numbers that can be represented grows larger. The biggest number up until two consecutive integers can be distinguished is . After that only every other number every even number to be exact until  after that every fourth then every eighth etc. That means if you add one to  the result is still  but you can add two and get   .Now mostly this is only relevant to consider when your numbers are large but you have buildings that are not very powerful. Consider the least effective thing in CC a single cursor that generates . CpS. The maximum number that can distinguish between two values that are . apart and I wont even go into the rabbit hole that says that you cannot even represent the decimal number . in floating point binary is obviously a lot lower than  its . But once your numbers are that high you wont have a single cursor and that cursor will be upgraded into the millions. And even if you had such a cursor the time where it mattered would be a million years in the past.This means there will be a time where every building vanishes in terms of CpS. Or rather since surely the CpC of all buildings are combined and added as a total the sum of all buildings CpC will be less than what is the difference between two consecutive representable numbers and the counter will just stop until you get enough upgrades to overcome that gap. Obviously this is only really relevant for all time baked cookies and therefore HC generation because as soon as you buy upgrades your cookie counter goes down into the realm of numbers with smaller gaps.And if you think that gap will never come The biggest difference between two numbers is a bit less than . Thats a lot of cookies. But even if we bridge that gap and have a CpC that high it will still take a couple of eternities until we reach the absolute maximum. Then the counter stops again. Then we have to purchase even more upgrades for the final gap  itself. Only if we add this number to itself we reach the next point Infinity. THEN the games has truly ended. Im going to jump between decimal and binary numbers. Sorry. Not making this up. IEEE  defines both positive and negative infinity. Also all this is only true if Orteil doesnt decide to move to an arbitrary precision library for JavaScript. I think this would be far too CPU intensive though.,CookieClicker,cg8hics,6,t5_2y620

It wont buy Santas Bottomless Bag for  more common drops which to me would seem rather efficient when it comes to Halloween cookies. But it hasnt gotten any Halloween cookies yet and luckily it bought one Valentine Cookie.I cant give you the number crunches but it would seem to me that spending trillion on some cookies that add  CPS would be a lot more efficient than waiting hours at a time for  building purchase. The trillions it would cost are negligible in my opinions. Its just mere fractions of a second to get them back when youre rolling with quid base CPS. ,CookieClicker,cg8q83t,1,t5_2y620

11664917,0,t1_dgh98qm,His statement was pretty presumptuous but the message is more or less true. Probably the thing thats making it difficult for you to see from an autoclickers perspective is your assumptions of what makes the game what it is or even what makes the game fun. For me when I played I definitely enjoyed seeing numbers go up. Thats pretty much the unanimous assumption that everybody here enjoys. However I quickly grew tired of having my attention diverted and having to check the game every  minutes for a golden cookie. Sure you could argue that wrinklers exist but that wasnt satisfying. I didnt find that method of play fun because of how overall inefficient it was. I did however find it enjoyable to load up a script like cookie master back in the day to handle the clicking of the Golden cookies for me. That way I could get enjoyment out of the game with the level of commitment I was comfortable with. From there I slowly became comfortable with auto clicking during frenzies but thats the end of what I utilised automation for. All in all the answer to why automaters dont just hack in an obscene amount of cookies into the game is the exact same reason as to why you dont. Its not fun. However people who automate do so because they dont find your way of playing fun which is the ultimate point of the game. ,CookieClicker,dgi8ew8,5,t5_2y620

I use Cookie Monster to make sure Im being efficient since I really dont plan on keeping it running for nearly as long as I did before. Auto clickers definitely seem illegitimate.
