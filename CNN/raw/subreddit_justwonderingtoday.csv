7965767,0,t3_4nuhuv,Weve added a list with further researches from the Union of Concerned Scientists.Weve mentioned in the video that livestock is the primary contributor to climate change. Further studies suggest thats not the primary contributor. Though it plays a huge roll as UCS nonetheless regards animal husbandry as an important problem facing our efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We should not forget that the subject deserves more attention regardless if its the primary contributor or not.We hope well manage to release another video on this particular topic to dig a little deeper.Until then it worths checking out besides some of the sources weve already added in the description.Also if theres anyone from the field who have gone through all these reports articles and papers and want to help it will be highly appreciated!
