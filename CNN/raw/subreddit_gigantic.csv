Also is the place that I posted my Hero translation while only get  views and  reply.In Japan there are no forum. Instead they have anonymous board for discussing almost anything beside the Gigantic.Russian and Korea I am not familiar with them so I cannot tell anything.So I understand why Motiga does not include Asia in the Alpha test and I am not looking forward Asian can join Beta either. Since in Asia no one is going to test for them play for them nor pay for them.I am upset with the fact while I understand Motiga has no reason to set up a server in Asia for only may be less than  ppls.

2483781,0,t3_2o0cbg,First off i would vote for the genre discussion but anyways...I might be biased since Im a person who honestly doesnt care too much about lore but I really hope Gigantic doesnt put even close to the amount of focus into Lore that Dawngate did. I know a lot of people from Dawngate care about lore but I also feel like it is a little premature to develop that much lore so early into a games development. Sure Motiga has a huge startup with  million dollars behind them but after you start to split that money up into different areas and spend it it really starts to feel constricted. I want the developers to focus on creating a solid foundation that has the correct qualities regarding gameplay. You can have a great story but if there arent great features that encourage enough player retention you have nothing. We are in a stage of the gaming world that whether people like it or not an open beta practically means released. Develop a smooth fun entertaining game that players will actually login to play every single day and not get bored after two weeks of playing. When that is done then you can add on and create your dream for the lore you want once you know you have a solid foundation. Can there be short stories for each character early on? Sure there can but anything more than that during a games early development might not be the best for the overall goal to success. Just my two cents and thank you for doing these discussions.

2869737,0,t3_2sz4m6,I think it is more important to reward good behavior than focus on poor player behavior.  Our minds tend to focus on the negative rather the positive so anything that can help to shift our attention away from bad thoughts helps immensely.A player could play  games where only a single player was being rude and rather than conclude that  out of  people are nice levelheaded individuals they would conclude that every single game is full of toxic players.I think some punitive measures are helpful but they do absolutely nothing to address this basic psychological condition.  Reinforcing positive behavior and rewarding good sportsmanship is probably the best way to help this.  Sure it is not going to magically fix the problem but I think it does quite a lot of good.As for what shape this positive reinforcement would take I am not certain.  I think I would like to see a special set of rewards only attainable through playerdistributed karmic currency.  Too many negative reports would also result in losing some of this karma.  I am sure there are better ideas than this that we can come up with too.For punitive measures banning accounts actually creates more harm than good because it likely just results in really angry smurfs.  Revoking chat privileges is the punishment I would most support.  Chat is normally the issue anyways so this is a very direct method to deal with the problem.  I do not foresee feeding being much of an issue if a flame war does not first happen in chat.  The most important thing to keep in mind in this discussion though is that justice is irrelevant.  Everything implemented needs to be there for purely pragmatic reasons.,gigantic,cnuag4g,3,t5_2rkwg

3094836,0,t1_cmc6tkc,Hi nbskl. Thats an interesting perspective. Its really common for developers of online games to set rules that are reinforced. We dont want our customers to be appalled when they open the game chat. This is done so a small minority of people dont ruin everyones game experience. I think most people will agree that spouting racist comments spamming scamming or phishing dont add value to the game experience.  Generally speaking those behaviors tend turn people away from your game.When you join a game hosted my Motiga you should not be worried about someone being a jerk to you. Being a jerk doesnt help win games.  I feel that ultimately most people will have a better time with enforced rules and the game will be more appealing to a broader audience as a result. You can still have your private and guild chats where the respective leaders have control of a private chat experience.  I know a group of friends talking to each other tends to go a lot differently than a group of strangers.  That being said Im very interested in hearing what everyone has to say. ,gigantic,cois16i,1,t5_2rkwg

3299872,0,t3_2xxxqr,I really like the partnership. Personally I dont care about Consoles which is why I see a lot of positive things coming from it. The issue for me is that we have crossplay between PC and XBone. This means that we either have autoaim to bring the console players up to the precision of wielding a mouse or that console players as good as they might be will be lacking on very aim based champions. I dont like the thought of having someone lackluster your team or being assisted by AI to be brought up to speed. It creates a very serious imbalance. I do support cross console play but ConsoleltgtPC play in a shooter is a bad idea.EDIT Youll never be in a crossplatform match unless you specifically chose to be. Is taken from  .

Throw in some art with the spoil maybe a little comic or short animation about a new map new music new character new creature new skin fur? or reworked character kit that you have been working on in the last few weeks.. Maybe do some interviews about the behind the scenes of what you guys do and think about when making a new charactermapcreature. Either character specific or as a whole... character specific would be pretty cool though..

If someone does some datamining and comes up with a ridiculous number for monetization of heroes just an example and puts that forth to the community regardless of whether or not its information that will actually be present in the game the community will voice a harsh opinion and Motiga could lose potential players.Id say when the game is at a point in development where Motiga has a more completed and polished game datamining would be less of a problem.TLDR Things taken from datamining now arent even for sure going to be in the game because its in a heavy development state and could impact incoming players perceptions of the game.,gigantic,cv41ljn,1,t5_2rkwg

5471426,0,t3_3pz1o1,Mhhh I dont really see what you mean by combo but while I didnt play since a while now I dont recall any of these existing in the game even with Xenobias mark of dispair and Svens Healing Water if thats what youre reffering to.  So I would say that there is no propper interhero combo mechanic right now mostly because Motiga wanted their very first heroes to fill basic roles and archetypes.   Nonetheless it seems that there is some kind of universal buffdebuff system  symilar to the one in Guild Wars . There are slows poisons burnings damagespeedarmor buffs... and each of these effects are spread amongts all heroes skills. And this gives some intersting interactions we could actually call combos. For example Charnok can apply tons of burning with pretty much any of his skills meanwhile Aisling possesses an upgrade on her basic attack that allows her to deal increased damage against burning targets.  Also as the game furtehr develops I think it will be more and more likely to see heroes that gives homing effect to allie projectile like you said and many other similar interactions !,gigantic,cwb0y9h,2,t5_2rkwg

5816224,0,t1_cxi1fwa,Because the majority of the PC playerbase who would take part in competitive will have nothing to do with console crossplay. So if the game is catered to console players and balanced around console players PC gamers will go elsewhere. This has literally happened in multiple games where the playerbase had been fragmented between PC and console. It has nothing to do with the core game itself and everything to do with the competitive scene... ,gigantic,cxi228a,1,t5_2rkwg

10138760,0,t1_dbsxp92,Agreed Baze! That is not yet the purpose of the page as stated above! For now sharing tips and tricks videos and builds and montages etc will be the focus. This is to aim at pushing the boundaries of entry level skill floor if you will higher. Sharing the wealth of knowledge certain players in this community already have to a wider channel Facebook allows targeted posts will only make new players get better since pro level knowledge is suddenly visible to them. If the new players are having FUN because they too can now perform the dank jumps and dodgeattacks cough Larson tyto cough I think they will probably enjoy the game more. That would probably mean theyll play more leave less games half way through out of frustration for simply not understanding what is going on etc etc. Knowledge is always a good thing. For now the page is basically a gigantic news paper. Obviously targeting it to gamers and other moba players might help grow the community as well heck...if motiga can make a better game because of higher revenue why the hell not. Ive already purchased the founders pack  times myself!

10264394,0,t3_5mz9z1,Assuming that it would have a different que and depending on how they might implement something like that it would Open up an optional gamemode that would increase the games overall variety Appeal to players who prefer the straight raw combat rather than the other more seriousteamwork centered aspects of the game Potentially reduce the amount of players in the games main mode who are not following the newest meta rules team strategies etc Potentially increase wait time of the games main mode by a few seconds assuming majority of players still prefer it over some kind of Team Death MatchArena Mode. Depending on the math there may not even be an increase. Slow down the addition of new maps bug fixes due to increased workload.So other than maybe a slightly longer que everyones game experience could improve. Take Smite for example even hard core conquest players still enjoy some siege and even some arena gameplay every now and again to mix it up. Those gamemodes also keep a lot of the casual Smite players away from conquest so alittle bit less rage there. Finally the overall playerbase is up a bit because now more casual players who are looking for something quicker and not as serious has a mode that they love.,gigantic,dc7iwpw,1,t5_2rkwg

10304618,0,t3_5nfl9r, Learn to stagger your actions by one second if you can. You get stamina back every  sec but any action that consumes stamina i.e. everything except walking pauses regen resets this timer When your health and stamina bars are translucent you are out of combat. You regen health consume far less stamina and regen a lot more in this state. Stay in it as long as possible sprint as far as you can with it get as many regen ticks before the action as you can with it  any ability and getting damaged takes you out. Being out of combat longer ramps up health regen and shortens the incombat period for your abilities bunnyhopping dont do it. Wrecks your stamina and even reduces your jump height Sprintjumping avoid over long distances costs extra stamina useful when going down slopes or to squeeze extra distance out of your last bit of stamina. But... Try not to fully empty your stamina bar. It takes longer to regen. Plus even if you have just one pixel it can be used for an emergency dodgesprintjump when dodging you have no collision with other players useful especially in melee fights. Also have full iframes at the beginning  Play like a coward Go for wounds. Dont do other stuff during rampage. There are exceptions but its better to learn these as you at least attempt to go for wound. Melee heroes have special jump attacks inflicts cripple from behind and dodgeattacks extra damage extra thrown in from behind. Comebacks are real. Dont leave games you seem a cool dude but gonna say it anyway Go for wound,gigantic,dcc30y4,2,t5_2rkwg

10878085,0,t3_5vgnvr,Guardian fights are some of the most complicated things in this game. Heres my rule of thumb I go for wound if a my health is full or near full. This can be achieved by sitting on a creature to top of during the initial attack phase. b my teammates are at reasonable health.  c there are at least two enemies down by the time the vulnerable phase happens and d the enemy guardians shield is  or lower.The finer decision making had to happen on the fly. How attentive is my team? How are we doing in team fights? How good is the enemy team? Are they near death? Most of this can be assessed through either your map or hud with a qui c k survey on the guardian fight.If you decide not to fight there are other things you can do to be helpful. You can sit on the perimeter and snipe at the melee you can damage an enemy creature hopefully killing it shortly after the Guardian recovers or you can start upgrading one of your teams creatures. Point is no matter what you decide to do try and be useful. ,gigantic,de1zwq6,7,t5_2rkwg
10883706,0,t1_de2fkp7,Build guides are hard. A lot of people might have their go to build but they also make changes depending on the enemy team and how the game is going. Also there a several builds that work for different heros. Finding a guide is more like an insight into how that person plays that hero and not the best way to play said hero. Of course there are some upgrades that are not as often used or clearly less powerful than the other choice but there are not to many of those.,gigantic,de2ks17,2,t5_2rkwg

QLB ELASTIC OOZEReduced the base damage ofElastic Oozefromtodamage.Elastic Oozenow deals damage to all enemies hit with the initial impact rather than just the enemy hit directly with the flask.How in anyway were these changes that hurtful to the hero? If anything it was a buff to the EO because it now hits everyone and not just  person. So the trade off was damage. Id rather have better utility then damage. with love a sven player,gigantic,de5ntak,6,t5_2rkwg
10916954,0,t1_de5zm7k,first off you cant really carry in this game unless you mean  people carrying a group. No one person can carry with how the combat is designed and the power system is. Second i played several games this morning of the few where it was not  from disconnects and leavers it was one team getting ratios of k  and  deaths while the other team got deaths and  kills.There was no in between at all. There was no happy middle ground. Either my team stomped or got stomped and that was all ,gigantic,de6092h,7,t5_2rkwg

11205105,0,t1_depx7fo,I have a question for a Tyto expert. I find landing the slash on Swoop to be really tricky and finnicky. Do you have any tips on hitting it consistently? I end up taking Free As A Bird a lot more often so I can consistently dart in and out which at least for my play style gave me far better results. But also because the swoop damage bonuses arent worth much if I cant hit them. | It seems like the target reticle is for the landing then the attack goes forward from there? Is it aimable after landing or straight in the swoop direction? Should I lead my target with the reticle to adjust for it or aim the reticle at them? Or is it just a really small window? ,gigantic,df231tu,1,t5_2rkwg

11327064,0,t1_dffu3gv,Indeed I think that considering the state of the game as of now the most profficient in between would be first to tackle the matchmaking issue which is by far the most painful weakness of this game it takes less than  seconds for me to find and start a game in Paragon Paladins or Overwatch. It takes between  minutes to find one in Gigantic and even then about  of the found game will end up not starting because of player disconnected or a player failed to join  this is a deal breakerThen they should provide minor update which will contain some regular bug fixes and small balance adjustement as often as one every weektwo weeks and communicate about the biggest update even small teasing is more than enough  a picture a  seconds videos what matters is that people have at least something to look forward to something concrete not just new heroes coming ETA unknown My point is that its absolutely fine if Motiga wants to focus on polishing instead of big content updates  I think it takes a lot of courage from their part to admit  we promised to have a major update every  weeks but we can no longer uphold this rythm so instead we will focus on polishing. Its totally fine but in exchange they have to show us that work is being done. And that goes with a lot of minor updates. Even if the Paragon team couldnt keep up with their everyweeks slogan the playerbase know that stuff is going on because there are small update every week. Thats the kind of mindset I want to see with Motiga. BTW thank you for providing the readings links I found this very informative. ,gigantic,dffwjtg,2,t5_2rkwg
11363908,1,t3_626ilm,i think you completely misunderstand what toxicity is... you can bitch about random teammates as long as youre not messaging them or doing anything like that to tell them they suck. In the current state of the VERY weak playerbase as well as the team MMR system that is used necessary because of small playerbase top players constantly are getting matched with lower ranked players. this isnt fun for either side and something has to change. ,gigantic,dfk2snj,0,t5_2rkwg

11463801,0,t3_63jv35,Lots of great thoughts in this thread! To reiterate what others have said we dont believe Gigantic is any more complicated than a standard MOBA. Arguably less so but Gigantic isnt a standard MOBA.Gigantic has always been intended to be freetoplay and you are correct that FP games require no investment from a new player to hop into a PvP match. Because of this its definitely on us to educate our playerbase. The tutorial is getting a major upgrade and the addition of bot matches should help ease new players into PvP.,gigantic,dfvexzu,3,t5_2rkwg
