Weve actually been back in LA for a few months and our rig is sitting at my girlfriends parents property outside of Fresno.Anyways check out the pics and videos. If you know anyone in the market for a pretty good buy on a low mileage older RV this is the one. Special thanks to uTechnomadia for their help answering my internet questions.
