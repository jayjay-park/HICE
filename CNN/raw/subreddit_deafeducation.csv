If more people posted more people commented and crucially if people upvoted more the algorithms will push them up. No upvotes  dead sub  dead community. ,deafeducation,d22xsyv,2,t5_313d3

9821104,0,t1_damp771,You are probably right about my making sweeping statements. However I do have my reasons to be wary of cued speech. Cued speech is just a manifestation of spoken English in a visual context. Deaf people as we all know do have a hard time with spoken English in any form  simply because they do not have a feedback loop that hearing people have for instance hearing people can speak after  years of not speaking but deaf people can lose that ability. So in school deaf children are taught cued speech and taught how to cue words that they read instead of what the words actually mean semantically. Im not saying this occurs in every school setting but cued speech teachers often do get distracted from what they are actually supposed to be teaching. And when kids do not succeed in cued speech schools they always get dumped into deaf programs with minimal language knowledge  and we are sick of that. Whats wrong with ASL alongside written English to teach deaf children in schools? What benefit does cued speech bring to deaf people that is other than being related to spoken English? Im sorry this discussion is going off point right now not even related to phonemic awareness at all haha. Sometimes I wonder if its just better to teach EVERYONE not just deaf people orthographic reading. There are studies that suggest that deaf people have enhanced parafoveal perception and because of that they read faster and have to go back less. Deaf and hearing skilled readers have equal comprehension skills but I think reading in terms of orthography rather than phonology is the way to go with deaf children. Im not sure if you are wellversed with this but Id like for this to go down a more productive route than just bickering about cued speech. ,deafeducation,danpiv1,2,t5_313d3
