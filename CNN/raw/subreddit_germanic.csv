3692247,0,t1_cqcvxfe,Thank you so much this is very helpful. Im glad to hear that not having a degree in linguistics will not be a problem. I performed a study concerning V acquisition in L Learners of German this semester. While it was not for a linguistics class it uses a lot of linguistic concepts in the realm of second language acquisition. I plan on including that in my applications.,germanic,cqd528h,1,t5_2ued5
