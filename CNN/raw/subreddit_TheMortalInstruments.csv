5366228,0,t3_3ohe3u,The show looks pretty awful to me from the inside out. Clary doesnt look right at allllll. For starters her hair is complete bullshit. Apparently its her real hair though so somebody FUCKED UP. She seems to have the absolute wrong personality for our more alternative smart sassy and sarcastic lead female. She looks more like a country singer than a girl whos about to become part of the NYC underworld.About the rest of the cast well this new Jace seems decent and Magnus in the clip was better than expected but toss everyone else. Simon is way too hunky and not bookish or the overlookable bff type at all that guy is tooo hot. Simon is supposed to get hot AFTER being turned into a vampire. I dont buy this Jace EVER being into this Clary. She seems like an idiot and he seems cast well so its a mismatch. While the movie wasnt perfect by a looooong shot coughTHE VALENTINE PLOTLINE JESUS CHRISTcough it looked damn good. It had a grittiness to it the whole underlying feel of demons are leaking through in greater numbers every year and eventually were all going to die unless we make more shadowhunters was subtly evident and I liked that. It also kept a lot of these little side details that made the whole world feel more real for me. I even liked the Shadowhunters having unexplained accents!I suppose Im more attached to the main cast than I realized. I adore Robert Sheehan the whole main five were well cast IMO and I wanted Godfrey Gao to work so badly. He was so hot and glam and perfect as Magnus except they dubbed him what the fuck.  I feel like it might have done better if the best bits hadnt been left on the cutting room floor. They say editing is everything and it was clunky and awkward at times. I know Im not the only one who was disappointed.The worst part about the show is that it feels horribly tacky. Its got that unshakeable !fake! ABC family sheen to it everything has this feeling of being overproduced and sanitized for middle America. UGH. Bland boring and bullshit. Heres another clip if you dont feel me enough from the two that you linked. Im afraid these are legitimate clips and likely to be aired asis or very close to this.Bottom line I have not watched an ABC Family show since I dont know ever and Im not going to start with this tripe. Ill keep my headcanon of the film cast and reread the books again and again and again and again...,TheMortalInstruments,cvxlhdn,5,t5_2vmly

8838566,0,t1_d77wwis,I hope they dont make it anytime soon. For example I was woried about how Hunger games and Divergent would turn out but obviously they both had huge followings that forced them to stick to the books more we dont have that for TMI or ID so its up to what they think is push for a general thing to attract viewers rather than lets make the big core fan base happy ,TheMortalInstruments,d7a9r1b,1,t5_2vmly
