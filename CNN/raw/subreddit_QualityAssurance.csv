408335,0,t1_cfn25w4,Automated testing is where you write programs to test the software the company makes. That can be done in a variety of ways. Manual is where you manually test the software by following test steps.Im not sure what a foreign language BA is but maybe it would look good to a company that has many translated versions of its product.,QualityAssurance,cfn39st,1,t5_2qkg3

1272046,0,t3_23q1vu,My company is an outsourcer in North America.  You can message me for more details.We do this sort of thing all the time whether its with web apps mobile apps console games or enterprise software.  Some projects are  years in length and others are  hours.  Some use us as their entire QA team others have us do spot checks along the way or a quick scan near the end.  It comes down to budget and expectations for quality.Writing test plans takes a couple days for experienced project managers.  Communication with the client is incredibly important.  Every project is unique but many of them follow a pattern and good testers can use hindsight to find the right bugs in the fastest time.  ,QualityAssurance,cicq0gi,2,t5_2qkg3

2090807,0,t3_2ikzm7,A but late for OP but hoping this is useful for people in a similar experience levels. urosaquarks covers a huge portion of what interviewers are likely to look for. A couple of other things to do if it applies to you. Emphasize your learning abilities. Nearly every question you answer should include some mention of how you picked up a new topic how you researched something how you were curious how you learnt from a colleague how you asked an intelligent question etc. . Show interest in gaming and the people. If you like a game that the studio produces mention it. One of the easiest ways to show interest is to ask questions. Ask your interviewers what they are working on what they like about their job what they like about the company etc. If your interviewer is an experienced tester ask them about how they got started in testing and how they got into the gaming industry. Ask them for career advice. If you are talking to a Engineering director or VP ask them about trends in either software or gaming. If you are talking to developer ask them how testing can help their job etc. ,QualityAssurance,cl5l5qp,1,t5_2qkg3

3103018,0,t3_2vmxjl,The other option is to go with a session sheet approach. With a session sheet you write down what you test as you go rather than define it in minute detail up front. What you can and should do in advance is to jot down some test points  things that you know from the design that you need to test  but thats as far as you take it. You then exercise the software using your test points as a guide but you react and learn how the software behaves as you go which is what testing is about and test as the fancy takes you and you record what you do as you go. This has the effect of preventing you blindly executing a set of predefined steps with your blinkers on and potentially missing things. In short youre more likely to test than simply check.We moved to this approach for our daily testing and it removed a massive overhead stopping us spending lots of time writing test scripts that were run once or twice and then discarded.,QualityAssurance,cojmkhu,1,t5_2qkg3

3700467,0,t3_32rgep,I got my intro into java with this courseIts good but I feel that it lacked concrete exercises as opposed to walking you through exercises. The current selenium course Im using is through compendiumdev.co.uk. It has concrete exercise modules that I find are better than just saying Go do something with this information. If you actually are trying to accomplish something it implants the information better. As a person thats been doing QA for ? years learn automation. Manual testing will always have its place and for me ad hoc testing something new is really where I have the most fun but automating tests is a must have for QA positions now. Who wants to manually run regression tests over and over? And what company wants to pay someone to do that over and over when they can get someone to automate those tests.QA folks need programming skills now.,QualityAssurance,cqe2tkr,1,t5_2qkg3

And even if that portion doesnt get automated...its still readable.So how does your company do it?

4604114,0,t3_3dp3m6,gt Then they asked me if a customer complained that the remote didnt workI dont think it would be unreasonable to start with see if I can get more information about whats not working.  A complaint of X doesnt work while disturbingly common doesnt give you any information at all.  What about it doesnt work?  Does it never have power at all maybe the batteries are missing dead or installed incorrectly?  Does it have power but doesnt change channels volume etc on the TV theyre using?  If thats the case which TV are they using it with?  Is it a TV thats compatible with the remote?  If its a programmable remote did they program it correctly or at all?  Do other remotes work with the same TV maybe the TVs sensor is broken?The point is that if you have absolutely no other information other than it doesnt work you almost always need to find out more about the problem.  Its very common for customers to give you absolutely no information and when that happens the first thing you do or possibly the second  you should probably do a very basic test to make sure something isnt obviously wrong  should be to seek out more details about the problem they are having.,QualityAssurance,ctaxo8d,1,t5_2qkg3

Automate it and forget about it letting you spend more time on new features and exploratory testing.I also think that for device coverage you shouldnt be aiming for  coverage on all devices unless there are big differences among the devices.

It was their first tool used for planning and testing.The tool has a userfriendly interface intuitively comprehensible buttons arrangement and carefully thought the system of switching between contiguous features. It is really usefull to execute testing based on creating test scenatios also make reports and you can creat a bug and upload it to integrated bug trackers such as JIRA etc. TestLinkIn spite of some difficulties with installing it is used by many Development Teams and QA Engineers.JIRA is mainly a bug tracker aiming to control development process with tasks bugs and other types of agile cards. It can works in couple with Zephyr. If you use a combination of those two you will get afull service according to the functionality of test management tools.JIRAZephyr PractiTest integrates with JIRA Pivotal tracker Redmine and other. If you have some atomized tests working with Selenuim or Jenkins this test management tool is able to work with them too by using API. qTest. The project has been being developed since  and aims at helping not only the testers but the entire team during the development. His interface is simple and userfriendly.TestCollab. You can get information on quality in the form of Success Rate depicting how good your product is. Furthermore there is Spent Time functionality which helps rating how much efforts each team member has contributed. TestLodge. It has really unusual design. This service allows customizing not only the standard fields concerning test cases and test runs it gives an opportunity to create roles categories priorities choose necessary parameters to be depicted in the graphics export settings.  QACoverage. It has its own bug tracker Defect Module. So you do not need to integrate with other systems to create issues.  TestCaseLab. You can creating a project invite members appoint them on either of two roles Project Admin or Project Memberetc.Good is that TestCaseLab offers its own format of .csv files or import which is a nice test case example for beginners. The service integrates with the following bug trackers Redmine JIRA and Pivotal.EasyQA . I think it is the newest there are so many options. For example if your test product is a mobile app for Andriod or iOS it proves useful.
