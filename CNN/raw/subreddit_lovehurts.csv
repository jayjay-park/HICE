36754,0,t3_1udqg9,If this is true if you really do like her why not try to get with her? Shes either a being nice so she doesnt have to tell you shes not interested or b truly believes you shouldnt like her. In that case I would say confront her and tell her about it and maybe ask her out.if this isnt your story then disregard it lol,lovehurts,ceim6nm,1,t5_2u240
6777266,0,t1_d0kbuvo,Thanks for the thoughts you are cool.I had this huge crush I was forced to take classes with her every day for  years It killed me rock bottom it took me  years of being alone to pick up all the pieces and put them back together I was starting to get momentum perfectly content alone then I  crushed on this other current girl at first I was happy I thought I was never gonna feel that spark and attraction again but as soon as I started making moves she leaves with a motorcycle guy  years younger than both of us. . It is all coming back all the bad stuff I was fine Im getting someone to distract me this time I believe is all chemical I am the victim of powerful not logical evolutionary behaviors Ill force my body to like someone else.have  Fantastic day ,lovehurts,d0khjcj,1,t5_2u240
