683772,0,t3_21zqzp,Autoimmune diseases tend to travel in packs in some people so rheumatoid GI issues like Crohns and skin issues like Psoriasis or Sjogrens wouldnt be too odd of a combo based on what youre describing.  A rheumatologist will almost certainly help you sort it out but if you dont like the doctor or feel like your concerns are being ignored please get a second opinion.  You mentioned be susceptible to infection.  This sometimes happens to people with RA before they even get treatment but its more often a function of treatment because the drugs suppress your immune system.  You might ask for a referral to an immunologist or ask them to check your immunity.  I know two people with autoimmune arthritis and immuneantibody deficiencies.  The sooner you get these things treated the better off youll be in the long run.  This is a good resource for RA and a support community.

My doc does think its very important I get the vaccine  so  much so that when there was a shortage I was given paperwork to be one of the priority people for getting the vaccine.It does seem odd though  I have no kids and I do not work with kids.

I would get a second opinion or ask for a followup appointment with your current doctor to explain to him that youre not fine and your problems dont stem from scoliosis. What I wouldnt do is wait and see. If you do have RA it is important to treat early and not wait until blood work confirms the diagnosis because that might not ever happen! or it shows up on xrays too late that damage is permanent!.

6596532,0,t3_460x7z,Hi there. Sorry to hear youre having a shitty time. Im in the same boat right now. My story is a bit different. I was diagnosed with RA at age . Growing up I had more problems with smaller joint pains and mainly the fatigue. But I managed to make it through high school playing three sports a year all four years. Soccer Softball and Basketball. So like you I was pretty athletic. After games I would hurt more than the normal teenager and it took me a bit longer to recover but it wasnt too bad. Keeping up with school with the fatigue issue was very hard. Anyways around the age of  I really started having problems. But these last three years have definitely been the worst. In and out of the hospital because of pain pancreatitis caused from medication ect. But! Now. Once Im actually back on everything lost my insurance for a bit I am so so much better! So heres what Ive learned you have to find the right medication that works for you everyone is different! I have tried  different shots before finally finding one that worked best for me. I currently do  methotrexate injection and  orencia injection a week and its been working very well. So dont be afraid to try different things if you dont think what youre doing is working. Also for the love of God please try to stay away from the opiates such as Percocet and loritab or hydrocodone! I promise they will do more harm then good in the long run. I now have a terrible permanent stomach condition due to use of those drugs prescribed use btw lol . I am currently on tramadol. And I know its also not super healthy but it works so much better doesnt have as many crappy side effects it lasts longer than three hours and doesnt give you the groggy cloudy high feeling that those others can give. Also if you are open to try medicinal marijuana and if its legal in your state try it! If you get a shop as a caregiver they will be able to help you find a strain that helps with the pain but doesnt give the euphoric head high! Its amazing how many different strains there are and the different effects they can have. I hope this helps. You should know though that youre gunna have to get used to slowing down a little. People with RA are just a little different than normal people. We need more rest we fatigue easily cant always do the things we used to because it hurts to bad. Depression and anxiety can also be a underlying effect of RA. But dont give up because there are still so many things you can do!!! Once you find the perfect cocktail of medicines you will stay to notice a huge difference. Good luck and I wish you the best ,rheumatoid,d01mw5w,1,t5_2tqwy

9379101,0,t1_d94qjgp,Yes. I actually went to a lab tested place not too far from me and they were really helpful recommending the best strains for me. I first tried the high CBD low THC and I did like it a lot as far as being functional and not bring melted into my couch or totally unmotivated. It really didnt help with swelling or anything but yeah I slept like a baby. I tried some edibles but they made me really itchy and uncomfortable even at small doses. I actually still have some left and Im giving them to my friend because they were not my thing.I next tried the high THC stuff which really put me out. To be honest I liked the high THC as far as pain relief was concerned but I woke up high in the morning a couple times so I had to cut that out since I have a long commute. Tolerance was another factor that turned me off. I smoked the same small amount in a joint for about  weeks nightly and the high THC seemed to build it up way faster. At the end I was having to smoke more to get a desirable effect so that wasnt cool. I really did like the high thc though. In my opinion edibles seem to be the best way to medicate because a small amount goes a long way and lasts a much longer time. Plus you arent smoking which isnt good for your lungs. EDIT Try a lot of different things. There are so many different methods and strains that you will probably find one that works for you. I think Im just picky. I used to abuse substances in my younger years so that probably factors into why its not my thing. I have friends that swear by it and it really does seem to have a positive impact.,rheumatoid,d94v8ve,1,t5_2tqwy
