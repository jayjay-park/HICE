In the meantime lots of months have passed and I wrote a giant post but it will have to wait since my computer lost the damned thing  Bare with me here guys.ampnbspUrsula was standing in the water. Things have changed. Ursula no longer had vague fleeting dreams of the waters. She could now feel the beasts presence she Knew it was nearby but it hid in he depths sometimes for weeks waiting for... What? Why was it hanging around this island? Surely there were more and bigger boats to smash elsewhere? In the months that had passed she had developed a sense of when the beast was nearby. And it always was.ampnbspThe beast had shown little of itself. Ursula had kept herself busy she had so much to do. So much that there had been hardly any time left for her to be angry anymore. She had a kraken to find a brother to train two little girls that had been neglected... She would join the children of Skane as they learned their stories and histories from Faelan. Late at night she would meet him in his room where they would sit at the fire and she would tell him stories and histories. They would discuss the differences in the stories track the similar themes tried to link loose stories together and tried to find the truth that could be taken from them. Faelan would teach her about medicine they used and their ways of doing things. These nights she truly enjoyed. A break from her responsibilities a way to put all the sadness to a pause. At the cave she had been angry at Fealan even though she knew he had been ashamed. The whole incident had convinced Ursula that the magnar was completely insane.,IceandFirePowers,cn7uogv,2,t5_32yit

And as for your suggestion of the problem with the red dragon prince I know Dorne and no one more than the Daynes have suffered under Tristans destruction. He is clearly ambitious and power hungry with little ability to find the means to make such a power grab possible.Aegon paused for a moment before saying A union to your great Houses would do well. However I should be honest. My grandfather was Bloodraven a known Targaryen supporter against his own kin Blackfyres. While I would not support this Tristan in his efforts to king himself I would also strongly prefer he not die. Such discussions may be better left for if we actually win this war though.

2802743,0,t1_cnhup66,Ursula stood across from the magnar hands slammed down on the table Cohaime was doing her damned best to ignore the beastmaster. Ursula was just about to Grab the Erskine magnar and just shake some sense into her when Ursula felt a rush coming over her. Her body jolted back to the floor where it lay twitching eyes rolled back into her head. Urulas mind however was not on that floor It was in the beast. She had never fully been in the beast as she had never been able to fully reach it and even now it had reached out to her. She could see water tentacles and the underwater island in the distance. The island was rushing closer with the second. Its tentacles wrapped around something heavy. It was swimming towards Skane! Ursula jumped up mind back in her own body. She turned and rushed from the dining hall where she had been confronting Cohaime to run to the shore. The kraken was coming and it was pissed.ampnbspUrsula had spent the best part of the last year standing on her favorite spot in the water trying to coax out the beast and trying to push it back when it surged for an attack. It was hard the beast was powerful and although she did manage to build a connection to it and was having kraken dreams every night now she still hadnt tamed the beast.ampnbspAs the beastmaster ran towards the ocean she shouted for the Erskines to get to safety. When she got to shore she found the Erskine guards the magnar had stationed there. She told them the beast was coming and to get to safety but they just readied their ropes and got into position.ampnbspUrsula tried to reach the beast with all her might concentrating with all her might. A monstrous sound rose from the sea and waves surged suddenly. Two massive jets of water shot upwards. from the sea. The waves crashed onto the shore violently throwing some Erskines over that had stood too close to the waters edge. The beast rose from the water a lot closer to shore than Ursula had expected. The massive monstrous looking creature started pulling itself half on land with a few tentacles it knew the Erskines did not have the power to hurt it. The beasts other tentackles were wrapped around something big heavy and broken. It looked like A ship? The kraken drew its tentacles back and... Its gonna throw! She yelled and the Erskines scattered but it was too late. The large ship got thrown on the rocky beach and shattered there in an explosion of eroded and splintering wood. Ursula saw how one Erskine close to her had his leg impaled by a large splinter he and others around him bleeding some would not survive their wounds. Ursula had managed to duck on time but her arm was hit A large splinter protruding from her left forearm. It had broken and the bone was sticking out with the wood.ampnbspWhile Ursula stared at it in disbelief some of the Erskines with ropes regrouped and started calling their friends forward. Lets catch ourselves some calamari! one yelled and they started throwing some  strong ropes towards the beast aiming for his tentacles and hammered in the ends of rope into the hard ground where they could. Others roped theirs around the large pointy stones that were scattered on the shoreline.ampnbspUrsula ran forwards STOP she yelled at it desperately. If only she could gain control in time then the Erskines might let it live. But the kraken was huge much bigger than they anticipated and half of it was still submerged in the water. The ropes and rocks they were throwing at it didnt even seem to bother him much but it did annoy the beast. It broke one tentacle free easily lifting some Erskines that were still hanging on to the ropes into the air with them. The tentacle shot forwards towards Ursula and grabbed her. The krakens suckers were lined with sharp pins she could feel them pressing into her flesh deeper and deeper as the beast squeezed. Another tentacle broke free of the ropes and swiped over the beach knocking Erskines with such force they flew through the air before landing on the stone with hard thuds and crunches.ampnbspNo its not supposed to be like this. Come on you are a beastmaster damn it! Gain control! She thought desperately. Ursula was bleeding heavily from all her wounds. The tentacle wrapped even tighter around her and she could feel her bones break. The pain was unbearable and the anger flashed red before her eyes. She had been so angry the last years at all the injustice that had been done and her own helplessness to stop it all and it all came together inside her now... She could feel the white hot ball of rage get bigger and bigger inside her consuming her whole. Ursula clenched her fists and started screaming with a fury none had ever heard from her before. The Erskines tried to save her but it was no use they just had to fall back again as the kraken swiped his tentacles at her. Ursula was so consumed in her rage that she didnt notice how the kraken had caught some Erskines and was now bringing them into his enormous gaping mouth one by one crushing them with rows upon rows of sharp teeth before swallowing. Ursula also didnt notice just how much she was bleeding and the pain started to fade away. The screamed once more and put her anger behind a mental shove. The kraken had felt that and was even angrier now his tentacle tightened around the beastgirl one of the sharp pins puncturing a lung. Unable to gasp as it collapsed she still went trough the motion. Not noticing trough the pain that the tentacle drew back and that it had flung her until she felt the sharp points pulling out of her body and heard air whistling in her ears. She had never felt such pain before. As she flew Ursula thought of her beloved twin brother Robin that lost an eye to the kraken the boy had been broken and depressed after it happened. She thought of the two neglected wild girls she had found in the cave. She thought of the Erskine magnar that had ridiculed her for speaking the truth and had become a crazy mess leaving her clan leaderless. It wasnt fair. She had to leave them all they need her! Without her everything would collapse beneath the feet of the people she loved. Her fury surged once more even hotter and brighter than before. The beastgirl put all of her anger and energy into one big mental shove but then she felt the impact.,IceandFirePowers,cnmnu6x,3,t5_32yit

I know youd all like to know why I made the attempt of young Davoss life so Ive decided to talk. The truth is at first it was just a job King Stark hired me to do over a year ago. But once I actually saw the boy it wasnt a job anymore. Writhing there on that bed like a snake on a rock the lad disgusted me. Doubtless his brutish face and horrific body were inherited from his father. Slitting his throat with my knife would have given me an extreme amount of pleasure and it should have made you happy as well. Killing the boy would have been a kindness. Ella POVElla swallowed hard. She didnt want to leave the city when Merry might yet live but she had to heed his wishes.
