4629872,0,t3_3ambps,I think this talk has given me the most help. In the world today many many problems would be solved or not even happen if everyone dared to stand alone for what they believe. Too many times people back off or change what they think inside just because its popular. Our thoughts and beliefs are precious because they make us who we are. If we hide this and back away when we are challenged to stand alone then we are in a way putting our light under a bushel. ,lds,cte5zu9,1,t5_2qlg0

4898216,0,t3_3hib9m,The church has made some big moves to minimize hurt lately. If the church will donate money to an LGBT center what will they do to repair relations with the BSA? I think some Mormons are looking through a far too vindictive lens here and have been for years at least  years as far back as I remember the BSAsplitoff rumors and the church probably understands the dynamics here better than those kinds of people do. The result may be surprising for them.,lds,cubyj4y,1,t5_2qlg0
4957456,0,t1_cujbx5k,I always read that as being tied to the legality of marriage not doctrine because thats whats given as the reason multiple timesgt I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.gt Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort I hereby declare my intention to submit to those lawsgt ... my advice to the Latterday Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.Also the fact that a widower can be sealed to a new spouse strongly implies that polygamy will be acceptable in the Celestial Kingdom. If monogamy is doctrine second wives shouldnt be able to be sealed unless the first wifes sealing is somehow annulled. And this only goes for men the official LDS Church Handbook of Instruction says thatgt Living Women  A living woman may be sealed to only one husband. . . .gt Living Men  If a husband and wife have been sealed and the wife dies the man may have another woman sealed to him if she is not already sealed.And if its not doctrinal why did apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote that the holy practice would resume after Jesus Christs Second Coming? So the practice of polygamy is in abeyance on earth but required in the Celestial Kingdom. But the doctrine and principle of plural marriage is still valid.,lds,cujfefg,1,t5_2qlg0

5282938,0,t3_3mjo1m,The internet is a great repository of information HOWEVER I think that you can learn more from observing and participating than anything else. There are LDS congregations throughout New York depending on your borough.  I would second the recommendation to talk to missionaries. But also try visiting a ward. You may even ask the missionaries if you could attend a Family Home evening with a local family. It sounds like family is important to you and that is a great intro. Further I would recommend getting a copy of the Book of Mormon. You can get one for free at Mormon.org or you can get one from any local missionaries. You can even buy one on Amazon if you dont want to talk to a missionary. ,lds,cvmygd6,3,t5_2qlg0

6765523,0,t1_d0iq4df,I think you overestimate most peoples desire knowledge or willingness to mess with VPN masks  for someone who controls their own computer unless they are doing something illegal which would call down the internet provider on them most people dont mess with masks. Those who share a computer generally just delete their history. I can confirm that both of the previous statements are likely accurate based on my personal experience in law enforcement. Further Id speculate that most members who would care that look at porn arent planning it with advance notice to go through the trouble of a  mask. They find themselves boredangrylonely and alone and thats when they wander into pornographic material with little forethought to set up even a basic mask. Only Those trying to avoid detection from those on he outside looking in would mess with a mask which is why they are primarily used by those illegally streaming content or torrenting content. Id guess that the average member who looks at porn doest fall into either of those categories or if they do torrent its not generally torrenting porn. Thats why i caution people to keep computers and for some even phones out of bedrooms and in common rooms. Thats become harder and harder with the shrinking of the computer but perhaps more important than ever,lds,d0j5gw8,5,t5_2qlg0

7793858,0,t3_4m2gst,gt During the Saviors ministry the religious leaders of His day disapproved of Jesus spending time with people they had labeled sinners. Perhaps to them it looked like He was tolerating or even condoning sinful behavior. Perhaps they believed that the best way to help sinners repent was by condemning ridiculing and shaming them. ...

If you think they arent then the problem is you. The most important thing is that we learn to understand them and they us. No one is getting any answers until we come to a common understanding first of each others realities.I am one of those who believes that doubt is part of the gospel plan. Some of us are given doubt. Others are given faith. Its up to both of us to learn how to capitalize on each others gifts. After all no one gets all the gifts.,lds,d5ioc8g,2,t5_2qlg0
