144035,0,t3_1vpfvk,Im a market manager who deals with stores at the retail level.  Most of the windows  hate came from the initial release.  I blame two major reasons why  PC manufacturers didnt produce enough affordable touch screen laptops for consumers.  Last year touch screen was considered an premium feature and often costing more than  while most of the laptops sold were value laptops in the  range.  Today nearly every manufacturer produces low cost touch laptops in the sub  range. With that said w is optimized for touch.  The experience between touch and nontouch are as different as a blackberry and whatever smartphone youre using now. Microsoft dropped the ball by not providing support for their product.  People took home their PCs and the first thing they saw was the metro screen.  Nobody knew what to do or how to operate their PC.  Their natural reaction was call it crap because they werent able to do what they could do on their old PC.,windows8,ceuu4ic,2,t5_2s692
152848,0,t1_cevjn4b,I bought my wife a laptop not long ago preloaded with Win  shes smart and techsavvy enough but doesnt really have time to dedicate to learning new shit. She hated it from day one and eventually swapped her laptop with mine which is a shitty Win  POS in hardware terms her machine craps on mine from a height. It took me all of  minutes to decide I loved the new OS but then I had nothing better to do than watch videos read guides look up best apps articles fuck about in Metro change settings to suit etc. I think just the touchpad swipe stuff ruined it for her  on a nontouchscreen machine with a touchpad almost everything you do ends up being a gesture that you didnt want to activate. I ended up disabling most of it and that made a huge difference to my experience. I can totally see how a basic user could go nuts trying to get into it. ,windows8,cevua47,2,t5_2s692
158791,0,t1_cewhf2v,I understand what you are saying and I definitely think they should have kept the start menu for people that wanted it and allowed for metro apps to run on the desktop etc.But it took me literally just a few minutes to arrange my start screen the way I want it and it honestly is better for me than the traditional start menu.  Not because I only run a few things.  It is the opposite Apart from the things that I run all the time I have a lot of things I run frequently enough to need quick access to them but not frequently enough and it is too many to pin them to the taskbar or fit them all in the firstclick menu in the traditional start menu.  With the start screen I can get to them by click access.And I think the hardware makes a difference too.  I dont use a mouse or a laptop with a small singletouch trackpad I use a laptop with a large multitouch trackpad.  And it is actually really natural to me being able to pinchtap to zoom out and back in to where I want to go and using two fingers for natural scrolling finger movement matches the movement of what is on the screen left and right to move the start screen left and right.  Much better than clickclickclickclick into a deeply nested start menu.But I still think they should have kept it as an option.  ,windows8,cewip8w,1,t5_2s692

253519,0,t3_1wyras,An all in one OS is desirable however we have only just got to the point where it is approaching a realistic proposition.Microsoft overreached just made an unnecessarily OS WinRT in hindsight as Intel chips caught up didnt follow through with the idea because their apps werent ready Onenote and Lync MX were late still no sign of Touch Office for Mobile although its clear its on its way and had to shoehorn the desktop in and then there were just utterly stupendous decisions such as having multiple control panels and a touch OS that couldnt be managed in a pure touch fashion.They should have waited and they are paying the price.If they came out with Win . with all the Touch Office apps people would want to develop on the platform.Great ideas just awful timing.Unbelievable execution on a genuinely excellent idea.I personally think it was a cavalier attitude from nontechnical people and the occupationally incompetent Sinofsky that you can shut up a ship beta hardware.Its hardware!You cant upgrade it when its designed to be disposable.I have a Win RT Surface and I genuinely like the idea but fuck me. Jesus fucking CHRIST. . I got burnt real bad. I knew the risks and dont hold grudges because it was always going to be V but there is just so much to be desired.The Surface  is what they should have launched but still no Office suite so no one develops on it.Its so obvious as to what the problem is how did it get this far?!?!?,windows8,cf715fs,-1,t5_2s692

1894815,0,t1_ckhi0tb,People are losing faith in the brand. The other OS makers Apple Google and Linux are all giving their operating systems away for free. Granted they all have very different business models than Microsoft but the consumer doesnt care. They see Apple giving away upgrades of OS X for free Linux being free and Android and Chrome OS being free... and they start to feel like a sucker paying  for an update to Windows with mixed results.Microsoft needs to give people a reason to give them another chance and most people wont spend money on giving them that chance with the level of quality they are currently expecting. People have more options now and they are exploring them in greater numbers than ever.Microsoft will lower prices in order to maintain marketshare. Windows and Office are dirt cheep in China because they are competing against piracy. They need to make it so cheap that it is worth spending a few bucks for a legit copy because none there is buying it for the standard retail price.While Windows and Office are the standard revenue leaders they do still have a big business in the enterprise and server space. They really need to adjust their business model for the changing tech space. Office is in real danger as well. They are now competing with free online offerings from Google Apple and others. The millennials arent going to Word when they need to write a paper they are using Google Docs and that should have Microsoft terrified. The fact of the matter is that Microsoft is no longer needed to get work done. People are doing it without them. Letting the world know this is possible has been Microsofts biggest blunder to date. The curtain has been pulled back and it will be nearly impossible to go back again.They do still have a lock on PC gaming but with Valve committed to taking them down and getting people over to Linux we can only wonder how long Windows will sit on top of the PC gaming world.,windows8,ckhikii,1,t5_2s692
