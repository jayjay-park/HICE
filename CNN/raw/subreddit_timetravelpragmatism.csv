9773849,0,t1_dahnjil,Ive reached a barrier and I grow fearful it is the one no teacher can solve for me like going into the Dagobah shit tree alone.  The idleness I cannot lift it save for brief periods.  I have made some small progress under the wing of a great teacher and the patience of others but I am growing old I dont believe the physical substrate on which my selfawareness manifests will last much longer.  I have seized the rudder too late and it is very heavy I cannot turn the craft around in time to avoid Time.  I am old and spent my youth afraid and disengaged I have mastered nothing and worse my character is that of an adolescent only a few turnings of the seasons into the maturity that most naturally develop.  I am a child just understanding the meaning of being an adult and my beard is grey.  I am old and I suppose Id like some comfort and some meaning for the one that wears the mask and smokes the special fire and knows the stories to tell me that its okay and the great Penguin will be resurrected someplace warm.  I dunno.  Im in the dark tree and I know its my own bullshit I have to face and I dont want to.  ,timetravelpragmatism,dahud7e,1,t5_2sevu
