2767735,0,t3_2roewn,TS has more save points than TS.Not sure how that will affect your experience but its a significant change. I played both in college and with TS wed have a room of folks cheering one of us on to get a perfect run to the midmission checkpoint. Once we had a perfect run we would swap out who played the second half. It was intense and rewarding but did require a lot of effort.TS was much more generous with the checkpoints which meant that you could make more mistakes and still get through the story line. Great story line but somehow I found myself missing the tremendous challenge of TS.,timesplitters,cnioj19,2,t5_2scur

At one point I think they were working on Haze Battlefront and TS all at once. But hindsight is  of course.,timesplitters,d9aq8pr,1,t5_2scur
10329943,0,t1_dcexxqi,gtI dont think you fully understand the meaning of the phrase gamebreaking.Yeah youre right in that. I took it literally like everything else. As in I wasnt aware you were pointing to an obscure phrase.  Which if your phrase is thisgtGamebreaking bugs implies that the game has numerous glitches that break the balance and intended features of the game. Then Ive never heard it when such a literal meaning is likely far more common. Funny that.gtIm the one whos at my wits end here because Im arguing with someone who A cant even get their facts straight B has provided  argument for why TS isnt a shit game C ignores every point I make and D hasnt even played Perfect Dark.Funny you mention PD. I already told you several comments ago in fact that I hadnt played it before. So why are you contesting that? How does that make TS a bad game? Do you only rate games by how they compare to other games? Not because of replay value andor how much fun you derived from the game? I also find it strange how you say you both platinumed the game and claim to have more knowledge about the game than myself. All the while calling the series garbage who in their right mind would platinum a timeconsuming series like TS and not like it? How could you  continue to play such a challenging series of games if you didnt like it? Let alone platinum all three as you so have claimed here.C which points did I ignore exactly? Seems you ignored my point about PD Zero entirely.as for B I dont need to give any solid reasons why I find TS to be a good game. I have already hinted at them if not told you already and it should be obvious. Since its all a matter of opinion. Which I take you could care less about mine anyway.Lastly This thread is about how PD makes TS automatically garbage which if you ask anyone else here simply isnt true. That would be bias.,timesplitters,dceygei,1,t5_2scur
