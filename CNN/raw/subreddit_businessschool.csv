649120,0,t3_20q585,I can empathize on the group work thing its very hit or miss. Regarding the level of independent work and relative lack of guidance thats somewhat typical of graduate school.

952772,0,t3_250o5y,This is all high level but should give you some good things to think about if you havent considered these yet.First you need to make sure you complete understand your customer.  What is the goal of the advertising model?  How does what you are offering do it better than what they do today?Do they advertise to increase brand recognition?  Acquire new customers?  Increase sales temporarily to the existing customer base?Do they typically hire external companies to provide marketing support?  If so do they have an exclusive contract with that company already?When you pitch it you have to wow them and show them why what you are offering is better than what they already have.  Make sure you do it in such a way that does not put down or insult the existing solution to that problem.  The person you are pitching to at a minimum had input into what they are doing now and very well may have been the driving creative force.,businessschool,chcl6re,4,t5_2tkw1

Im glad I chose it was considering Econ but keep in mind its a doubleedged sword marketing is a very vague major.

1952632,0,t3_2gzvq3,Entrepreneurship is only useful if you have a marketable skill to entrepreneur.  You need more than ideas  you need to be able to develop them.  Usually engineers with MBAs make the best engineers.  Accounting on the other hand is useful in every business  from starting your own restaurant franchise to working in fortune .If you look at the most successful entrepreneurs none of them have degrees in entrepreneurship. ,businessschool,ckohuyh,3,t5_2tkw1

4356877,0,t3_3awf58,Completely useless.If you want to pursue SEO learn the tools the onpage is relatively straight forward but the offpage is where you can really stand out from the crowd. SEO is all about testing adapting traffic leaking and monitizing. I cant imagine learning this in the classroom. What does it cover? What is robots.txt and Optimizing meta tags? lolGetting a certificate in SEO is like getting an MBA from university of Phoenix  its a joke and no one takes you seriously. ,businessschool,csgr4k6,7,t5_2tkw1
