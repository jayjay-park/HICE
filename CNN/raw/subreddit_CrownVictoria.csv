3186901,0,t3_2wmjbl,Ultra.... Sonething by Goodyear. Not the weird ice pattern though.      R the normal size for my car. I think it takes studs but have had no issues thus far in NYS.      Snowtrakkers are the best snow tires I have found and take studs but they are really expensive now and hard to find.,CrownVictoria,cosbmll,1,t5_2unu0

5005219,0,t3_3jhw8t,My buddy is in need of some cash to pay bills. Hes selling his  Grand Marquis which is in beautiful shape. He has receipts for everything hes had done. Hes also only the nd owner and it had been garage kept until this year. The only thing that doesnt work as far as I know is the AC. It drives well runs strong and all the vacuum lines are good and functional. I just thought I might try to help him out while letting you all know of a fantastic deal going on. I know it isnt a Vic but its damn close.,CrownVictoria,cupbfc3,1,t5_2unu0

5438459,0,t1_cw6pbei,I use it for dvds for my son satellite radio and back up camera are nice to have.  I use my phone for GPS also but the bigger screen and more customization options appeal to me.   You may have to remove a bracket that the factory radio slid on but Im not sure.   You shouldnt have to modify anything on the hvac controls.,CrownVictoria,cw6teui,1,t5_2unu0
5569093,0,t3_3rdo0b,These things are fairly cheap to repair go for a LONG time if you maintain them theyre comfortable easy to drive considering how huge they are etc.  Id love to have had one of these for my first car.Plus when you learn to drive in something large you can easily drive anything smaller afterwards.With k that thing has a long life ahead of it.  If the price is right go for it!,CrownVictoria,cwneau3,3,t5_2unu0

7775749,0,t1_d3pz7se, Test drive and inspect the car on your own. Verify mileage idle hours check body panels for damage or repairs inspect engine bay to make sure everything looks fairly good check wear on the tires check the seats trunk etc. When test driving test out all the equipment on the car the radio the air conditioning headlights wipers etc. Test all the gears to make sure the transmission works fine. Drive the car normally on the road and highway and if the owner allows do a wide open throttle test floor it and do kickdowns from a cruising speed to make sure the car doesnt have major issues changing gears or getting up to redline. If the car clunks doing kickdowns or misfires under load misfires feel like a shuddering or stuttering the car will not pull you know there are ignition issues which have to be worked out.  Take note of the VIN on the car can be found on the drivers side under the windshield when outside the car and if you are not present at the prepurchase inspection have the mechanic verify the VIN of the car the seller takes in is the same VIN as the one you are trying to purchase. A conman may try bring a different car to the PPI than you are purchasing.This video by Scotty Kilmer will give you the right idea.Another one. Once you have personally inspected and verified the claims and youre interested in actually buying negotiate a price based on what you see and make it contingent upon an OK from your trusted mechanic. If your mechanic gives you the goahead and there are no problems with the car you already have an agreed upon price. In my case the seller was tired of people getting the car checked out and bailing or trying to haggle mercilessly and wasting his time. We agreed on k beforehand and said I would purchase the car if my mechanic said there are no significant issues with the car.You tell him you want to have a mechanic do a prepurchase inspection first obv. you need a trusted mechanic first. Give him the mechanics address and have him take the car there or meet them there. Generally you will pay for the PPI. Make sure your Mechanic has a good OBD II scanner because sometimes a shady seller may have any trouble codes reset so make sure your mechanic verify that the OBD system isnt throwing up any trouble codes. If the mechanic gives you the goahead and says the car is in good working order wo any major problems you have your price negotiated already. Go through with the purchase procedure as you would with any other used car. There are many guides of this online. The seller needs to have the title in hand and in their name. Any funky bullshit about it being their uncles car is a red flag abandon ship. Have them show you their ID and verify they are the actual owner of the vehicle and there are no liens on the title and it is clean. Carfax and Autocheck can be useful for checking the history of the vehicle. Carfax tends to have slightly more information in my experience. Go through with the purchase. Get a bill of sale stating the seller is transferring the car and title to you get all their info down etc etc sign over the title get the keys and take the car. Register it insure it etc.There are plenty of resources online with how to go through with a used car purchase. Be careful cautious and aware its not hard to buy a car used and transfer the ownership just make sure the owner is straightforward and doesnt do anything fucky.Having an accident history on Carfax isnt the end of the world. Mine was involved in like  accidents but they were apparently all minor and didnt result in any major damage to the vehicle.,CrownVictoria,d3q1fl3,1,t5_2unu0
7907917,0,t3_4nisw2,I was just kind of curious and going to throw out suggestions as to what it might be so this doesnt really affect me.

8306580,0,t1_d5frhs0,So far my . has been less reliable and more expensive than any other V Ive owned.   Theyre overly complicated theres a reason GM is still using pushrods in a motor that can wing to k and make hp without breaking a sweat. ,CrownVictoria,d5fvnuz,1,t5_2unu0

9436129,0,t1_d9c34a6,Youre not far off it was somewhere between your low estimate and your low retail. I just shy from talking about large sums of money on here so didnt want to say it outright. Ive gotten some more info from the PD to help with shipping logistics  they said itll drive onto a trailer so hopefully that means no major transmission issues. Theyre also looking to see if they still have the back seat they took out for the piss bench so fingers crossed. Kind of bought this on a whim and thinking of it as my Bluesmobile of sorts.,CrownVictoria,d9c3fuc,1,t5_2unu0
9539437,0,t3_5bipa6,I just got a  from what ive read the  had some issues with the rear axle. The drive by wire system was introduced in  and some people prefer the  as its the last year with full mechanical control.  Apparently the carpet fitfinish got gradually thinner as they got away from civilian sales and went fleet only at the end of life.  For me its newer and lower mileage so the  was it.  ,CrownVictoria,d9oxmyj,5,t5_2unu0
