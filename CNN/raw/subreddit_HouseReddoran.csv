1869129,0,t1_ckee81q,Works for me. Do you want to try to make it a weekly event? A recurring scheduled event may help with awareness and attendance. The other guild Im in GSCH does a community siege on Blackwater every Tuesday from pm West coast based. You are all welcome to come out for those as well. If you want to get crazy we can make Tuesday one of our event nights too and we can zerg it up from pmpm! that may be a little much haha. Im thinking two nights a week from pm would be sweet.,HouseReddoran,ckef9ax,1,t5_31acm
