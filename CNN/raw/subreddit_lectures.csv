131207,0,t3_1umosi,He constantly talks about survival but his illustrations hint at the possible fact that his definition of that term is quite loose. The thing that really makes me very skeptical of his way of thinking is nature. In nature the strong do not survive. Its the resilient the lucky the fit who survive. So if we accept his basic observation that the premier objective of any state is to survive then it follows that the future from his basic perspective is even harder to make sense of than when we try to approach this question empirically. The reason again is that adapting to allies competitors and environment not growth is the key to successful modeling. Tens or even hundreds of states constantly adapting  a fundamentally unpredictable future. Im not opposed to trying to try to make sense of the world of powerpolitics but at the very least the repertoire of survival strategies needs to be expanded beyond growth. The disadvantage then becomes that modeling can no longer be done without computers and quantifiable information.p.s. His claim that its easy to measure capabilities may well be accurate but its my understanding that his illustration of that fact is just false during the Cold War the US overestimated the capabilities quite drastically and Im not talking about propaganda here. Anyway thats what books by other notable political scientists have led me to believe so...,lectures,cetdgay,1,t5_2qidy
290500,0,t1_cfaq2gt,Adam Smith was one of the very first to do a costbenefit analysis of the British Empire. He found that the people of Britain did not benefit as they paid in blood competition and high taxes. However one sector of society the merchants and manufacturers made huge profits. Smith made the link that it was exactly these merchants and manufacturers who made the policies in the first place.This has modernday parallels. The US people have not benefitted from the Iraq war theyve had to pay for it. But the likes of Halliburton General Electric and Boeing have made huge profits. ,lectures,cfavi9b,4,t5_2qidy

703785,0,t1_cgk6n7s,gt How about you elaborate on why you think this lecture is so detrimental to societyHes saying all religions essentially provide the same service and completely glosses over the hateful things done in the names of those religions because the religions were left to be interpreted however the  participant wants. The radicals do bad thing with religions. The good people read between the lines. Why leave something so equally strict and open for interpretation out for others to use to indoctrinate children undermine science invalidate the importance of a consensus and allow everyone to have their own facts. Facts are not exclusive. They are facts. Thats the nature of them. There is nothing factual or open for revision in religion. Its an antiquated way of thinking that creates prejudice based on arbitrary things that are not based on fact and small children often have no alternative but to be indoctrinated.Religion is bad. Spirituality is good. Religion is man saying he knows Gods will and man should listen to other men who pretend to know Gods will. They also take money from man to supposedly execute Gods will. It discourages personal responsibility. Everything is in Gods hands. Blah blah blah. Most of these principles are nothing like Buddhism but based on the very poor lumping of religions and their worthiness. Christianity  Buddhism  Islam.Any time someone advocates that all religions are good they are being selective with their facts. They arent all good and none of them are keen on revision based on new information because how could there be? Its not strange to them that God stopped talking several thousand years ago and nevermind the wealth of historical inconsistencies.Bottom line bullshit is never good. Dont propagate it as truth. Dont marginalize someone for pointing out religions oppressive shortcomings and sense of entitlement. Thats not pointless vitriol. Bad shit is done in the name of religion every day. There are other ways to get the benefits of religion without religion.,lectures,cgk9u7g,0,t5_2qidy

3343117,0,t3_2yd97l,Interesting lecturer. Rushkoff comes across as a knowledgeable thinker and someone it would be interesting to have a conversation with.The lecture itself was most interesting as it was giving historical context to the new media of computersinternet. Worth the watch just for that.My biggest takeaway was the idea of a population not wanting or even needing Real Democracy but rather an illusion of Democracy. The idea itself isnt new but I thought the historical context prewriting priestly utterances to todays tweets was an interesting way of thinking about the subject of power.As a software developer myself I agree that those who dont write software are in a sense the new disempowered illiterates. But maybe thats OK. Society has organized itself around a priestly class for a long time and for the most part it works in a rough and ready good enough fashion. Then again maybe it sucks and this new medium will finally liberate us from this archaic structure.However if the progression holds then future generations will be programmers by and large just as today almost everyone knows how to read and write. So the cycle begins anew...What interests me now that Im thinking about it is what happens beyond programming? What new priestly class and media comes after?Im not sure the average literate person before  would have been able to imagine a world of programmers being a possibility much less what that would mean in terms of power. It intrigues and amuses me that I too am likewise unable to imagine with any confidence what comes next even as I pride myself being a member of todays new literate elite.,lectures,cp9c97i,5,t5_2qidy

Eventually capitalism will make everything so cheap that we will all be so rich that no one will have a reason to steal or cheat because everything they want is available to them. Think about things like paper food computers and clean water which used to be expensive are now so cheap that they can be thrown away. This is directly because of capitalism.

The experts must prescribe the path that guarentees they cant be sued.  In persuit of optimizing first for this often time the long term health and long term benefit of the patient is not optimized and often actively harmed with st century pharma.My dad would be dead now without my help and perspective on this.  The experts wanted to do something that would have made him dead many years ago yet here he stands happy healthy because we knew what was right for the long term not what was right for the doctor and hospital.Michael Vassar gives the thought a very good rundown  the way through this video Im not one of those crystal pyramid energy medicine chakra healing nut jobs.  Im saying that to optimize for health you must know the nature of when the experts cant help you and you have to protect yourself from situations where the doctors will actively harm you because if you walk out of their emergency room with a pep talk and go kill yourself the doctor can be sued for Not Helping.  When in fact the root of the problem was the patient not having a support network to help them deal with their inner troubles and not having the ability to address the problem themselves.  This is why rich people are more desirable over poor people often times they have access to things that are better than first world medical care they have access to teams of people who can lay out all the different paths outlined with riskpayoff charts and let the patient choose their path.  The doctors always choose the sure path of immediate help.  And the doctors must provide drugs because if they dont they are sued.  If they do and the patient gets a little better but suffers long term degradation for not handling it naturally thats no skin of the experts back.  The doctors will never prescribe cardio and good diet for an obese man they will prescribe you guessed it.  PILLS.  Experts prescribing pills for fatness.

For you sporting Americans Ep  The Big Man Cant Shoot may be known to you and the supporting thread a bit thin but nonetheless leads to excellent insight. Ep . Saigon for organisational studies peeps  Vietnam War peeps  structure of Govt peeps very interesting issues raised. Some of Gladwells lectures are better than others but to me he sets the standard. One may give a handful of facts that are possibly quite interesting. But give me a point of view a few facts a situation and provide an explicative development from or too that point  the idea of the lecture and you have won me forever. As an aside it is why I tire of many American podcasts as they spend too much time being quirky or post modernist jumping from C to G to F to A the pointless counterfactual even but dont really lead to the new idea or the counter intuitive.
