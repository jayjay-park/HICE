868727,0,t3_242gyh,I like his accent and very brief answers during interviews. Hes got an awesome mask and a hot girlfriend. Good morale for the team and the fans.Seriously though in my opinion he wasnt anymore consistent than Smitty this year. The pair of games he didnt play so well towards the end wouldnt have mattered had the boys came through during the games he held the opponent to two goals in regulation.I think hes a great backup goalie. A big step up from Barbs. However hes a UFA and he will definitely consider other options perhaps even less money in order to get a realistic shot at a starting gig. Mike Smiths contract questionable contract in my opinion doesnt really give Ms. Palmers boyfriend a realistic shot at a starting job.I think hes earned a pay raise. Im mean come on Visentin makes more than him. If GMDM paid Barbs . mil Greiss deserves . mil. But I dont know all of the repercussions of upping his pay and if itll impact us upgrading the teams lack of offense.TLDR hes good and deserves a raise but Im sure there will be better choices for him elsewhere. Not sure what other options the Yotes have. Reliable options I mean. Not sure what the evaluation is on Visentin or Domingue.,Coyotes,ch311wf,3,t5_2roqf

1154900,0,t3_27cjb0,Im not in town at the moment. I can ask a couple here though if anyone cares to represent me tomorrow? Ill try to put one directed at each member there For Tippet In targeting free agents in the upcoming season I want to know what type of player he will be targeting? Has he talked to GMDM about any needs for a veteran Dman Z is currently our oldest or is he looking to the AHL for such prospects? Also someone tell him to extend Vermette already.  For GMDM With the salary cap increase it is likely that player contracts will inflate some this offseason See Phaneuf. Are there any concerns from him about being able to keep up with some of the wealthier markets as far as player salaries are concerned? I know in the past he has expressed that the front office has been extremely willing to part with some money to land top tier players but that was with the old cap does the new cap come with any concerns? Also someone tell him to extend Vermette already.  For Leblanc In the past week there have been a number of allegations that the team is not profiting enough to repay the city of Glendale. Coming up depending who you ask anywhere from .. million dollars short. While I do not believe this is an endemic problem I cannot imagine that CoG is too happy about it. How will the shortfalls parking tickets other events going to be fixed going into the next season? Note I do know that the deal was signed in August so I am more than willing to cut the ownership deal some slack on that account. Also someone tell him to extend Vermette already. Other Misc. AHL teams moving out west? I know an extension was signed with the Pirates. Are they looking to have an AHL team in Tucson or Phoenix next season? What are the prospects on that? Extend Vermette.Ask a question about the draft... Did anyone particularly impress them in their interviews or combine workouts? What do they think of this class overall? In comparison to last years?Oh and thank you a bunch for doing this both to the users that are going and to all three of the panel,Coyotes,chzjj8z,5,t5_2roqf

Ekblad Speaking of him Im not sure wed get him at  but you never know.Reinhart I think this is the pick we should go with. I like everything about his game and he just seems like a Coyotetype player with the hard work.Draisaitl I love how he plays and if Reinhart isnt there at  then we should take him at .Bennett He also wouldnt be a bad pick what so ever.

1741972,0,t1_cjyqbon,Im not crossing that particular Rubicon unless it becomes readily apparent. But keep in mind Yandle was a RFA like Subban after his breakout season in  during the th circle of ownership hell and instead of forcing Maloneys hand w either his money demands or a trade demand to Boston he resigned to a very fair deal. Its certainly not out of the question that can happen again. Yandles trade value is certainly going to take a hit with him nearing UFA  since  point defenseman are a rare breed and since Yandle is highly valued for his leadership as well as his offensive ability Im still very much of the opinion of keeping him unless an offer too good to pass up comes by. And until Maloney indicates otherwise Im sure thats still his position as well. ,Coyotes,cjyql30,2,t5_2roqf

3022709,0,t3_2us03y,Hanzals point production probably suffers because he usually takes on the the opposing teams best centers.  He is a great shutdown center.  His size helps in that respect.  Unfortunately his size can get him sent to the box more that we would like.  When bumping and grinding against the likes of Joe Thorton Anze Kopitar there are bound to be some injuries.  I would prefer to keep him rather than see him go.  He seems to be at his best offensively when we have wingers with puck handling skills streaking up the sides much like we saw in preseason when Samuelson and Domi were on his line and he was able to camp in front of the net.,Coyotes,cobaudl,3,t5_2roqf

If the ownership group is planning on rolling out a jersey rebrand in the next year or so its likely is already in the works. its much much more conceivable to have the fanbase influence the team going in a throwback direction.While i do like the concept uniforms that were posted in this thread.. as was mentioned its very hard to get fan concepts to become the primary home  away jerseys logos etc brand. The NHL ownership and Reeboks own design team are the ones who would handle that entire process.When the islanders switched their unifoms it was met with fan outrage they switched back. Same goes with the Sabres. oilers are kind of in that same boat they went back to something that they never should have changed away from in the first place. Penguins will be fully transitioned to the old early s unis in the next couple of years i guarantee it. Flyers switched back to old uniforms. Seeing a pattern? Also very common in the NBA. Basically the trend is that the team will try to do something new the fans will tell them that the old look was way better and then they will switch back. if we have enough people on our side we can do the same,Coyotes,cp8fnqf,4,t5_2roqf

The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers Association after each team nominates one player in competition. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career or even lifethreatening illness or injury.Source,Coyotes,cpxdhe7,4,t5_2roqf

He was all celebrating afterwards thinking he actually did something useful for a change but really it was all OEL doing the hard work and all he had to do was stand still.Am I coming off like I hate him?

7149286,0,t3_4dchv7,Notable UFAs next season Doan Tanguay Gordon Tikhonov Chipchura Grossman LindbackWho should come back Doan obv Id go for Tanguay again hell be a cheap veteran presence that will serve the purpose for what next season will be and signing Grossman is important since Stone will miss some of the start of the season. I also might go for Chip hes a cheap reliable fillin guy that we can always waive if we have a young player that can beat him for a role. The others can go. Poor Lindback.RFAs Sekac Plotnikov Rieder Stone Murphy Tinordi Connauton Dahlbeck Domingue GaudetWho to keep Rieder Stone Murphy Gaudet and Domingue are the slam dunks I imagine we drop one of Tinordi Connauton and Dahlbeck probably Tinordi due to the nature of his suspension. I like Connauton so I think we should keep him for sure. Sekac and Plotnikov can be replaced with a young player pretty easy so I dont care but I bet we keep one or both on twoway contracts.Young players that will make the team Strome and DvorakBarring some crazy forward signing I believe both of these guys will make the team. If the Coyotes can make some sort of marquee signing in the summer Dvorak could be pushed out but I imagine we will be seeing both in a Coyotes sweater for the majority of next season.Young players with a chance at making the team Perlini Fischer Garland MacInnis Bunting WoodBefore anyone goes crazy when I say chance I mean even the slightest chance. Probably one or two of these players can make it or even should make it. Perlini had a terrible year no doubt but sometimes players in junior just dont want to be in Juniors anymore and have dog seasons. Then they are reinvigorated coming into the Pro season. He has the tools just needs to get his head right. Fischer has impressed me in juniors and man he is great in front of the net. Him and Hanzal will be annoying goalies for years to come. Garland has tons of skill and hell likely get a chance to go up and down throughout the season. MacInnis could actually be a surprise out of camp. Hes had a great season really responsible player and a big body which could be useful on the bottom  lines. Coyotes seem high on Bunting so hell get a chance throughout the year and Wood is young but could get a chance as we just need D men.So there you have it really long as all my posts on here are. ,Coyotes,d1qsuks,3,t5_2roqf

7263932,0,t3_4evp9m,It would take a massive deal to pry Matthews from us. Not just for the idea that he is a hometown boy but I think you are underestimating how good he is. A lot of people were saying that he is Eichels level and would have been picked ahead of him last year if he were eligible. Also our center depth is not as good as you may think. In our division you need those big lb defensemen. Domi while great is not that. Realistically we only have Strome and Hanzal who is up for a contract soon. Also note that defensemen take forever to develop into fully NHLready players. There is no Aaron Ekblad in this draft that you can plug in and play  minutes a night. Even with some of the top prospects we would be looking at several hundred games before they are viable and even then they likely would not be Norris contenders. I think we are better off targeting some guys in FA next year and possibly trading for some more developed prospects. ,Coyotes,d23uvyx,2,t5_2roqf

Its possible they are waiting to sign Doan last so that in the event they dont make any more signings they can just use Doans contract to fill out the rest to reach the floor.They can do some tricky things with signing and performance bonuses to get Doan the money he deserves while fiddling with his cap hit.

One week from now Im flying to AZ for not just the Ottawa game but also the NJ game sporting my Doaner sweater for the first of the . Always wanted to see him in real life on the ice in a Yotes sweater before he retired.,Coyotes,def0v5c,2,t5_2roqf
11084018,0,t1_deobgyb,Offended that I called the polyshits out?Im pretty sure the public never wanted it in Glendale and the only reason Glendale got the ticket was they overpromised on almost all fronts transportation support tax allocations commercial infrastructure etc.  If Glendale had been honest and done their job we wouldnt be discussing this.It was a money grab for Shitdale politicians that have kick backs on the Gila Arena construction and operations.If you think this has ANYTHING to do with public opinion you need to take those rosecolored glasses off.  Please go back to rTheDonald with your obvious trolllolo account.,Coyotes,deod3ot,3,t5_2roqf

11208924,0,t1_df25jso,Hopefully not as dreadful as we are. I remember Leblanc saying the initial plan took so long because they had so many options and didnt want to hunker down with one right away. If thats true I have some hope. But I really dont know how they would be willing to finance it without some taxpayer involvement.,Coyotes,df2iosi,2,t5_2roqf
