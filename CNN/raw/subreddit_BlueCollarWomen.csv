1385391,0,t1_cipxhkc,It was a very practical course. We got the necessary anatomy and functioning a bit about horse behaviour too. Imo the theorethical part was too little. I wouldnt have minded more but I look into those things myself anyway as do most of the really interested students. Like we couldve atleast have dissected a leg or something but they didnt do that there. Shame but I took it upon myself to check where everything was situated with a few classmates P The German made many nice hearts! All for his GF tho not for us hahaedit this was in Belgium Anderlecht ,BlueCollarWomen,cipxw9e,2,t5_2vqg9
1463986,0,t3_2affhr,A thread about lady welders brought me to this subreddit Im a dude and Im so happy to read this post.Use to work in a mineralogical plant doing fire assay and sample prep stuff. Sample reduction was so loud ear protection worn at all time was required. It was so liberating working somewhere that I could fart at my leisure. One shift I was working with two other guys doing OT on a sat the power died right as one of my coworkers was in the middle of a massive rip. The other dude and I started laughing giving a hard time etc and he just looked at us and said please damn well know all you motherfuckers do it too. My response was obvious and made possible by the good people of McDonalds. ,BlueCollarWomen,cizsbni,4,t5_2vqg9

3452925,0,t3_2zpeeu,I bought some Privos  years ago and they have finally worn out.  But they felt amazing for a lightweight shoe.  Removable insoles with nubby massaging cushions.,BlueCollarWomen,cpluz7t,1,t5_2vqg9
3842910,0,t1_cqtlomy,Jesus two fitters saw me at my gym and the one guy looked like his head was going to blow off. Oh man drywicking is the best. Too bad it always seems to stink to high heaven after a few wears despite washing!,BlueCollarWomen,cqubqax,3,t5_2vqg9
4012910,0,t1_crcvy4f,That is PRICY! But I guess cheaper than a skin graft after a regular bra melts into your skin...,BlueCollarWomen,crdpb17,2,t5_2vqg9
4544788,0,t3_3db15o,thanks for the recommendation!  i have a  year old and mulanlilo and stitch are MY favorites.  there have been a lot more strong female leads lately though.  brave was a nice try but didnt hold her attention.  tangled was pretty good.  i resisted my little ponies for every but its surprisingly tolerable.  we have only recently been watching more tv because its been so dang hot lately.  she usually plays in the shade while i work but lately she has needed more distraction from the heat so ive let her watch a movie a day on my old laptop as a reward for helping in the morning.  ,BlueCollarWomen,ct3hwja,2,t5_2vqg9
5715855,0,t3_3tczh4,Splitting up the word tougher with an emphasis on her tougHer is a clever idea but to me it reads as tugher and Im pretty sure OSHA frowns on that. Would have said this in your survey but there was no freeform box in your instrument.,BlueCollarWomen,cx5lvtp,3,t5_2vqg9
5866013,0,t1_cxo7caf,Aha. I see. And does one sort of float between those jobs or do you specialize? Which are you?,BlueCollarWomen,cxokcxd,1,t5_2vqg9

8206689,0,t1_d0r74mj,Im terrible at finishing projects. The push kart has been cannibalized its now most of a frame for launching bottle rockets off the back of a bike. I can fix a VCR with a pair of chopsticks and a butterknife but I cant seem to transfer photos off my phone. Ill learn. Keep your eye out for a post probably titled How I burned myself and why it was worth it.,BlueCollarWomen,d53e2pu,2,t5_2vqg9

I am union and my political leanings are communist.I am currently working as an industrial mechanic which here is sort of a mash up of pipefitter and millwright with troubleshooting.

I appreciate the advice and the personal stories  Ive been encouraged and Im feeling more confident about it.,BlueCollarWomen,dbwqhlg,1,t5_2vqg9
10530502,0,t1_dd1b1q1,Yea Exactly! They kept on telling me at the hall how its great to have no experience and that means theyll train you the right way and its all good and then I go on the job and everyone is rolling their eyes when I dont know how to hold a sawzal or know the difference between a rocking drill and a normal drill. Everyone is nice about it but I can just feel the judging. I wish that I had done projects around the house more growing up. ,BlueCollarWomen,dd1qx5f,1,t5_2vqg9

11077605,0,t1_den3kk7,Yeah youre right about that. At least working for yourself you can decide if you want to put up with the BS on your plate or not. Ive had a taste of freelance work while its extremely nice to do on your own time it comes with its own issues just like most occupations ha.,BlueCollarWomen,denmx70,1,t5_2vqg9
11133418,0,t3_5yy7v1,At my habitat for humanity group there are two older ladies who come almost every weekend. The enjoy giving back and learning the skills. They say it keeps their mind sharp. I would check that out if you are interested in learning the skills only. ,BlueCollarWomen,detynu8,6,t5_2vqg9
11288985,0,t3_6140z8,I havent gotten too much flack for being female maybe Im just lucky. I find the big thing is that fine line between joking around harmlessly and the transition to jokes that are inappropriate which you need to stop dead in their tracks. You dont garner respect by letting people walk along over you letting people make sexist jokes or get too close to you. In terms of people trying to dissuade honestly fuck them. Do your research on the trade you are interested and learn the facts and make sure you are as unbiased as possible when looking at yourself. There are so many good tradespeople out there who dgaf whats between your legs who will help you make the right choice and give you good information. Usually its pretty easy to tell if someones a douche and if that is the case dont waste your time and move on to the next source for info. The trades can be pretty hardcore especially if you are doing production theres no doubting that. That being said I really dont think witty comebacks are going to change the viewpoint of a closed minded person. The key is to find a good crowd of people that are decent human beings being part of a crew is the best safety net. If someone is icing you out seriously just ignore them once they realize you really dont care what they think about you they let their guard down. People are silly like that cause they are ignorant and you dont have to eat what they are serving up. ,BlueCollarWomen,dfbl9bz,7,t5_2vqg9
