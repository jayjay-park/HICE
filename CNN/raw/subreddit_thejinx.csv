3361797,0,t3_2xms2l,In response to your edit I think its attentionseeking and thrillseekingas you pointed out. I remember reading somewhere so clearly this is very credible that one of the common downfalls of psychopathssociopaths is that they want continued attention even though the best option would be to stay out of the limelight and a part of them even wants credit for the crime. ,thejinx,cpbgxcp,2,t5_35i5j

3403812,0,t1_cpg6bm5,Yeah probably not. But I still think its hilarious just as such a benign question to break the tension of realizing hes going to finally go to jail and holy shit.,thejinx,cpg9de5,6,t5_35i5j

3415713,0,t1_cphlymm,I read that he would name all the dogs Igor and he started using the word as a verb saying that he wanted to Igor Douglas or something to that effect. Yikes.,thejinx,cphm6a3,3,t5_35i5j

3418921,0,t3_2zd5ef,The he was right I was wrong before that makes me think he was referring to earlier conversations he had with his lawyer who warned him against the documentary. Durst wantedinsisted on having it made against all advice and common sense. ,thejinx,cphzcn9,14,t5_35i5j

3427769,0,t1_cpiwx7q,It could be similar to Galveston he went hiding in Trinidad then got to know Karen Mitchell she figured out who he was. Perhaps she started snooping or he thought she figured out some info? It seems everytime Bob feels like hes threatened over what hes done in the past just killing the person seems like the answer to him.,thejinx,cpizoy8,1,t5_35i5j

3461784,0,t1_cpmq3ny,From what I understood was that they were in succession rather than all at once as well...Thats what makes me suspicious...also the murders. ,thejinx,cpmv9wy,3,t5_35i5j
3481226,0,t3_2zz1x0,Ooooo!  That is an excellent theory.  Im being serious.   No lie Ive been wondering what the truthers will have to say about all of this given the  WTC connection.   Honestly  I thought maybe Jeb is delaying his presedential bid to see if the Durst case gets the Bush fam in hot water.  If something happens to Robert look out.  I read somewhere that he insured Tower  like Sept th.....,thejinx,cpp32ld,-4,t5_35i5j

3559157,0,t1_cpxyo90,Im no psychologist but I believe one of the people in the documentary said his thinking is compartmentalized. They think since he stated the body was too heavy for him to move he chopped it up to make it lighter for transportation. ,thejinx,cpxyw0v,1,t5_35i5j
