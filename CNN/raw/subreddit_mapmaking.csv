1760454,0,t1_ck1237b,well for a straight fantasy campaign this is not a big deal.If you want to get nerdy about climate zones ocean currents and the rest then it is nice to know.do you have an idea where the equator is for things like jungles the tropics etc?feels right for something about the size of Greece or Ireland which has plenty of story telling potentialof course the known world  can be much smaller than the real world.Alexander the Great thought the world was maybe  or  or  the real size of Asia for example.  He had no idea how many kingdoms there were in India.Also the planet can be much bigger than Earth meaning that the climate is all the same on this map even if it is pretty large.

2615244,0,t1_cmvzm4r,Generally rivers follow these principles Gravity Works! Water flows downhill! Water gathers in low spots to form puddles ponds lakes etc. Unless there is a spring etc water generally follows the low points going along valley bottoms that act to drain the land around them. Rising water in a puddle or pond etc will take the first opportunity at the lowest possible point to continue flowing downhill. It does not wait to get higher for water to exit through some other higher channel. A surge of water such as from a large storm can make water overflow in many places. This is because the water is collecting faster than it can drain and so it rises. Any weak spots holding the water back will be worn away. Eventually the weakest point will wear away the most rapidly making it the dominant exit point for the water in a pond etc. and all of the water will flow out through this one weakest point. The only time you get water spreading out and splitting is in large marshy areas like marshes swamps and deltas. Otherwise it is incredibly rare for a river to split,mapmaking,cmzy8aj,1,t5_2sfsa

A remote site that is connected to a natural resource such as a mine a quarry a logging camp etc. This way the prisoners could be put to good use usually at a distance from any civilized places where they could easily flee to. An island. Island colonies are useful for keeping people that you dont want to kill off but you dont want getting free easily.

8182389,0,t3_4re6yv,Apologies for the awkward post Im on mobile.This purple is a region of my world I am more heavily beginning to focus on. In order to make things click better in my head I need help coming up with a general earth analog to compare the purple region to as I am delving further into flora a fauna.The arrows are a very! rough depiction of the prevailing winds which are essentially just a reverse of earths. This landmass is a supercontinent that stretches from pole to pole but what is shown in total is just roughly N to S.So far I have the general area in purple as maybe similar to much of Argentina with the NW part being more tropical as it abuts the rain forest to the west. I figure the interior would be a gradient of humid and dry grasslands with a river that steadily increases in size going through the middle flowing to the coast. The eastern coastal area being a wetter Delta due to rivers converging here. This eastern region would have more tree growth compared to the interior.I just want to know if I am way off base. Things dont have to be perfect but I enjoy a semblance to reality. Thanks in advance and any CC is more than welcome. Ill clear up any confusion as well.,mapmaking,d50ck99,1,t5_2sfsa

9930890,0,t1_db1pc18,A few minor tweaks on this.Rule   correct though in principle a lake in an arid area can dry without an exit and there are inland deltas like the Okavango delta where water dissipates. Rule   Not strictly true. In an area with significant topography and as a result significant alongriver drop in elevation they do tend to be straight. In areas with low topography they do tend to develop meanders. But counterintuitively the river velocity in the high velocity part of a meandering river can be significantly faster than downhill flow in an incised river. The interesting bit about a wide river in low topography is that the velocity varies very widely across and into the river. Near shore in a straight section it is low. Out in the middle faster.Rule   Orographic Precipitation  the rain fill primarily fall on the side that the wind comes from. So you need to look at your wind directions which are generally northeastsouthwest or northwestsoutheast but you need to look at the diagrams to get it. And a very large range e.g. the Himalayas on Earth modify the flow so... not trivial. Anyway youll get far more rain on the one side so much more erosion so much so that there is a situation where the mountains rotate really tilt as they get eroded and their compensation changes. If you want info on compensation ask.Rule  Where a river empties into a large body of water you will often get a delta depending on the sediment load of the river and the ability of the lakeocean to carry away the sediment. If you do this is the one place where viewed from a distance the river will seem to split. This is permissible doesnt violate the physics of rivers because the system is a huge mess of slowly sinking sediment being rebuilt constantly by the river.I can get more technical if anyone cares trying to keep it somewhat civilized!

9981238,0,t3_5ihzic,Theres an app called InfinitasDM InfinitasDM by Atom Switch Inc. I backed on Kickstarter. So far I only have it on my computer as Im still waiting for my iOS download code but its available on iOSAndroid for purchase  right now. With it you can create maps from scratch with the drawing tools import maps from files that you can then draw on and you can take photos of physical copies of maps to import in and then draw on.One thing I find really cool about it is the ability to link other maps in your campaign file to a marker you put on the map. So if your players are travelling between cities you can have the big picture map up with point of interest markers on the different cities and locations. You can then link those markers to another map so if they decide to go to one of those locations its a simple clicktap to bring up the map for that area.I havent used it in game yet but from messing around with it it seems really useful for DMs of any system its designed for DampDfantasy games but Im setting up maps for my Star Wars Edge of the Empire game in it.,mapmaking,db8l0mb,1,t5_2sfsa

About the font you should definitely look into a more readable font. The font you have used is highly stylized and could maybe work for a single header such as the world name in the corner of the map anything else should be at least readable. I personally like to use a font called Queen Empress for major settlements. And something simple like Palatino Linotype for smaller villages that need to be readable at smaller font sizes.

That they run parallel to the sea for a long time and dont connect to the lakes at all suggests some really funky and unrealistic underlying topography. Its also strange that none of them have an tributaries.Like ujohnnywings suggested its helpful to have at least a vague idea of the geology underneath your map and to be thinking about the natural history when you draw it. For example when I look at how many clusters of mountain peaks and huge lakes there are on such small landmasses I think this most be a highly folded hilly landscape. Highlands like that wont have many major rivers at all so I would only mark a few on the map. Those should start just a little bit inland and drain into the sea or start in the mountains and drain into a lake. If they have any length to them they should be really branching and twisty.,mapmaking,dcktih1,1,t5_2sfsa

11150805,0,t1_devvm6t,No problem!gt Now I just have to figure out how I can apply this to achieve realistic relief lines for topographyHey I planned on doing this next! I spent a while dissecting cartography and was going to start sharing all the spoils. Do you mean shaded relief or contour lines like caterpillar mountains?If contour lines click here Great method can be combined with appearance panel characteristics like Pathfinder gt Merge  Add to prevent intersections and overlaps.,mapmaking,devxjw0,2,t5_2sfsa

You could shade in black globs around the margins with relatively fewer black spots in the middle hotter regions but that might be fairly timeconsuming.  Groovy s curvilinear lines around the edges might be adequate.  I almost think I might need to experiment on this problem a little...,mapmaking,df7dlwy,3,t5_2sfsa
