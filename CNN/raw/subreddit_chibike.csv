223646,0,t3_1woaez,Id avoid the zips. Plows arent bound to regular work hours.  Expect to see them before snow hits until the snow is gone. ClearStreets is your friend.As much as I love bikes I would stick with CTA for the morning at least. If you are by a station you can still use your magcard.Ventra is fine dont have it next to your credit cards even says it in the instructions when you get the card. Also hold the card to the sensor until you have the green light.  Most issues with ventra were either user error or have been fixed.  They were magnified by shitty nonexistent customer support and our lovely hysterical lazyjournalist news.,chibike,cf3x2mw,7,t5_2shaw

My original plan was to do red or black deep v rims red bar tape a red seat and a red chain but I can most likely procure any of these things in whatever color you would like.

Lets also not forget cross traffic and kids running in an out of the trail.Its called a ROADBIKE for a reason if you are a TRYHARD you should get on an actual road head up north or go west to open roads. If you know anything about training on a bicycle you know you need an open road. Not a shared bike path. If you train on a shared path you are doing it wrong. ,chibike,cja3hky,2,t5_2shaw

4573259,0,t1_ct6w2pk,Ive been considering riding up to Kenosha tomorrow via the XXX ride as well to visit someone.  The only thing is that itll be a oneway for me as I would stay in Kenosha.  I still havent decided yet if I will go but if I do I could always use a riding buddy as Ive never taken that route.  I do prefer roads over trails.  If youd like to ride up together we can meet up at the coffee shop in Highland Park and head north.  Same goes antizero.  Ill post up here later once I finalize my plans as I still might decide to just head back to the city from Highland Park.,chibike,ct72hf6,1,t5_2shaw

5060745,0,t3_3kabsr,Ive done both highway  and the path around Gary. From my experience Id do the extra ten miles and go around Gary. The traffic for me was terrible with many rude drivers. Plus you have to bike through the refinery hellhole competing with big trucks for road space and breathing in that shitty air. The path around Gary isnt spectacular but its safe and leaps and bounds better than .

I have on really close call after another on there.

8663200,0,t1_d6oaquq,It really depends country to country. And unfortunately Chicago street cyclists seem to have their own unofficial hand signal language which makes it difficult to find a definitive guide or sometimes make out what exactly they are trying to signal. Its just sort of passed around word of mouth so its best to ask if you dont know what the signal is. This is pretty close slides  This South African guide is probably the closest to what youll see in Chicago  If you use the SA one for the most part everyone should know what you mean. The biggest difference is Slow down or youre being an ass is similar to the stop signal only you open and close your hand instead of it just being a fist or palm. ,chibike,d6oinnp,6,t5_2shaw

11019196,0,t1_de6eh8k,All I saw in the video was perfectly reasonable legal use of a horn fitting with its purpose to alert other road users to an impending crash. A little toot to let the arsehole parked in the bike lane to check their mirrors before pulling out into traffic without signaling whats wrong with that? People in cars respect horns. A horn gets them alert makes them brake makes them take a second thought. About to get right hooked and no time to stop? What can I do? Yell look like an angry maniac and likely not even get heard or regarded? Ding my little bell that the driver probably cant hear anyways?

No bike parade No mention of bike parking No car for bike swap Admission costs  Not family friendly in many citiesIve been to  Tour de Fats in a couple of different cities and this isnt a Tour de Fat. Its just a festival that happens to benefit an NPO in each city its held in. Yeah the The Roots are cool but I was down with local acts. Actually when it was held in Nashville I really enjoyed the nonmusical performers like the yoyoists the magicians the stuff that was pretty family friendly. And I didnt even have a family then! It was just fun. I guess Ill be skipping this year keep an eye on the event West Town Bikes is planning and just generally buy more stuff from West Town Bikes directly instead. ,chibike,df8p8zh,5,t5_2shaw
