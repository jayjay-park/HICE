1079565,0,t1_chqs5pb,Actually it is sebaceous the wiki link you linked to spells it the same way I did? face of confusion.What I do is just take enough of what feels right maybe  teaspoons for my face while my face is wet.  Already having your skin wet makes this makes it feel more normal.I do it every time I shower which is really only  week or so. When I do it this way I sometimes do my back as I have problems with bacne that I am working on and then rinse off.  When I leave I wipe down with a towel.Sometimes I do just my face and I wash apply small amount of oil rinse and wipe off with a towel.After both of these I apply moisturizer.  It is funny that doing this makes my skin dry maybe stripping away a lot of the good oils with the bad ones.Usually I only do this once a week sometimes more.Thank you!,VeganBeauty,chqzzs1,2,t5_31m9x
1149062,0,t3_27a9pw,I get my face lotion from a woman who makes vegan products in Canada called Just the Goods. She has a shop on Etsy. Love her stuff only down side is shipping so I usually put in one big order to help with the cost. ,VeganBeauty,chyvs6z,2,t5_31m9x

3222190,0,t3_2tgnu0,Is CeraVe on any legitimate crueltyfree or no animal testing lists? I didnt know there is  cholesterol in their products and that it is derived from animal byproducts. I think I need to start carrying a magnify glass when I go shopping now because it looks like I wont be using CeraVe products to wash my face. ,VeganBeauty,covze57,1,t5_31m9x
3416987,0,t3_2z9cfn,I use Wet N Wild but Im not really happy with it. I am on the hunt to find a better vegan liquid foundation right now but I am afraid to buy a bunch of stuff I end up not liking.  If anyone has specific recommendations I would love to hear them! I really didnt like elfs foundation either.,VeganBeauty,cphreng,1,t5_31m9x
5313620,0,t1_cvqv108,I dont think Sebamed is cruelty free anymore and I think the Clear face gel has been replaced with a mattifying cream or I read about this in Germany at least but it still shows on the US website. But please correct me if Im wrong I dont want to spread misinformation.,VeganBeauty,cvqvliz,2,t5_31m9x

9609742,0,t3_5cldbf,gtI consider myself to be rather lenient on the definition of cruelty free as I still purchase products that use animal byproducts and beeswax.I agree with a lot in your post but then I came to this.  How do you correlate having such a strong stance against cruelty free products but be comfortable with animal byproducts?  That is inherently not cruelty free.,VeganBeauty,d9xli2n,10,t5_31m9x
10679825,0,t1_dd7dbci,it doesnt but I feel like if youre vegan you probably care about other systemic issues,VeganBeauty,ddhjk34,3,t5_31m9x
10705340,0,t3_5t473v,I have very curly hair and try very very hard to be  vegan in my hair products but its stupidly difficult to do so cheap. But the more you spend the higher quality product youll get and your hair will thank you. You can try going to Lush and asking someone for help and for some samples to test out. You can try hugo naturals or or derma organic but Ive never used them before. I use devacurl products theyre not certified vegan but theyre not derived from any animal products and to my knowledge they are animal testing free. But theyre more expensive. HOWEVER the creator of devacurl wrote a book called Curly girl handbook. You can make your own knockoff deva curl at home which Im told is pretty easy and far cheaper. Ive also never done it but its worth a shot! I know that Jessicurl is vegan but youre looking at closer to  a product. ,VeganBeauty,ddk6clq,2,t5_31m9x
