179300,0,t1_ceyutll,I think the Sumo is probably my  topurchase at the moment SBDC but I go back and forth between that and then thinking of saving up for a HAQ GS like the SBGX.  Very different watches.,Seiko,ceyuviz,1,t5_2v2a5
278079,0,t1_cf9kzpi,Basically the watch as it came in was just a starting point.  It wasnt a watch it was a framework.,Seiko,cf9l34x,1,t5_2v2a5
345395,0,t3_1y0roi,Be careful bending that spring I broke one and the replacement wasnt that easy to find. Eventually found one on ebay.  There are a couple of possibilities from my personal experience. In taking off the bezel and popping it back on its possible that it got bent. I also did this. The bend was slight but it was enough so that it didnt sit perfectly flush you wouldnt really notice it without close inspection and this caused looseness. You can see if this is the case by popping off the bezel and laying it on a table pressing various points around the edge  if at some point there is give the bezel is bent. You might be able to bend it back in a vice.  Another possibility is that the gasket on the inside of the bezel isnt all right. It could have a kink or tear in it that causes everything to not fit well. You can get replacements at various places on the internet.

383296,0,t1_cfkhm76,I can tag you as wants vintage Seiko but it would help if you had any thoughts on which model you were interested in.

1209516,0,t1_ci5ilx5,The s are unfairly maligned.  The movements are really quite solid.  Allmetal movements for one thing.  People dont like the flatprinted dial with its promethium lume and the greenish hand lume.  As for s the time is now to get one.  ,Seiko,ci5ot2d,4,t5_2v2a5

3192004,0,t1_corvt1w,Thank you very much for your indepth and poignant response. And yes as I mentioned I definitely know that blowing in it is far from a professional service technique! Just seemed to work at the time.My budget... well. I really dont have one. Candidly this is the first nice watch that I have ever owned so I have no idea what service for such a watch would cost and I dont exactly have expendable income at the moment midwest gas bills am I right?. At present its running smoothly... the only issue I am having is that if I use the stopwatch the ths of a second hand doesnt always return to  so I need to calibrate it afterward. After a little over  hours the timekeeping is still deadnuts though. Perhaps the biggest and glaring imperfection is the glass. My grandfather always wore a watch. Always. He only took it off to shower. So the glass is pretty battered. I know this can be replaced but based on your response would you advise against that as well? I will definitely contact uSeikoholic should I wish to take this further and somehow obtain the capital to do so. Again many thanks!,Seiko,cosuncl,1,t5_2v2a5

4248490,0,t3_388iic,My watch guy charges between  and  for a full modding job depending on just how much work he has to do. Were talking about taking apart everything except for the movement and swapping it all for aftermarket stuff. The only time I was charged  was when he had to transplant the s from an old SKX into a custom  and it required minor service due to age.,Seiko,cs4inhq,1,t5_2v2a5

5609097,0,t1_cwscr9z,Yes get that water out ASAP just as quickly as possible.  A refrigerator is a very efficient dehumidifier too probably the best way to approach it.  Pull the crown out put in on a plate and put it in the fridge for a few days.  Or ideally pull the movement and gently blow the dial clean with canned air.,Seiko,cwsd2q0,0,t5_2v2a5
