500701,0,t3_1zh765,State space really just arises from KCLKVL for RLC circuits.  Any RLC circuits state can be represented by the voltage across each capacitor and the current in each inductor.  So your x is a vector containing all of these values.You could come up with the statespace representation by writing out all the node voltage equations and performing arithmetic to a move all the dVcdt and dIldt terms to the left hand side and b ensure that there is only one such term per equation.  Your LHS would then contain sx and your right hand side would contain AxBu.  All the terms associated with the independent sources would give you Bu and everything else would give you Ax.Honestly you wouldnt even need to ensure theres only one dVdt or dIdt term per side but if you dont do this the particular form of the state space representation would lack a physical meaning.I know thats a little difficult to follow but if you were to try it with a  or  capacitors andor inductors I imagine you could get a sense of how all of this scales to larger circuits.

Vegetable oil can be used to better insulate the tops.  I used bare copper wires in the bottles.  All of the bottles were placed in a bucket which was filled with saltwater to the same height as the bottles and this surrounding saltwater was connected to with a copper wire.The saltwater should be saturated i.e. dissolve as much salt as you can until it stops dissolving.,ElectricalEngineering,chj59ju,2,t5_2sey9

2366735,0,t3_2mh6g3,This is an XY problem. First the problem you are observing is due to the change in the impedance of the ground and other characteristics not the ground voltage. Ive dealt with this exact problem before and what youll need to do is improve shieldingground planes in your circuit design and probably also change your averaging in software.Its also worth noting that measuring the ground voltage doesnt make sense voltage is relative and whatever you define as your ground is by definition zero volts.You did not state what you are measuring these voltages relative to but the bottom line is that ground is V yes you can have voltage drop along a ground plane but then its no longer ground and the difference in voltages you are seeing are not the direct source of the problem.To further illustrate this you will notice that the sensors work better if you are touching the ground of your circuit or if you attach a large piece of metal to the ground of the circuit.,ElectricalEngineering,cm48k5c,1,t5_2sey9
2426188,0,t3_2n881h,You can just find projects on the internet to do. Find something you like go to your local electronics shop or order the components off the internet and build away. There are lots of introductory tutorials on electronics too. So just find any project that you want to build then google or youtube a tutorial on each of the parts to learn how it works before building it. That is the best way to learn.Here in Australia we dont really have electronics stores that I can just go to but I know in lots of other countries there is one on every corner. I use RS components to order things online  free delivery and my orders are usually less than a couple dollars for everything I need. There is also digikey mouser and lots more. RS is the only one with free delivery here in Aus tho  Starter kits tend to be a little bit restrictive and will charge more than individual components for the convenience of being in a kit.As for arduinos if you want to be more mechatronics orientated  with electronics and software together  then arduino is a good place to start. You dont need to spend lots a real arduino. You can just order a clone and it will work equally well. I myself have never owned an ardiono apart from the MEGAs in my D printers but sometimes if I have a microcontroller project that I want to debug to check if it is my code or some other problem I will just grab at Atmel chip put it on a breadaboard and flash it with ardiuno firmware. Works just as good as a real arduino. Grab some LEDs maybe some motors etc and play around with it.

3659983,0,t3_31hvsx,Think of a raspberry pi as a full computer like your desktop along with some microcontroller facilities.  You hook up a monitor keyboard and mouse and get started.  It comes with a linux operating system although there are many different ones you can use.  This is a pretty cool platform for learning to program and tweak a linux computer if you screw something up just reflash the SD card and youre good to go.  I have a friend who uses a raspberry pi connected to a large hard drive to store pictures movies music...etc.  He connects to it via the wireless.  Although this is neat it isnt really any more informative for engineering than learning to program on your normal computer if you use it in that fashion.  You can hook up sensors to its GPIO pins to view the outside world but this is where the arduino really shines.  The arduino is only a microcontroller.  It is a board that has a microchip along with ways of connecting that microchip to various other hardwarecircuits you can attach to it for say robotics projects.  If you want to build a battlebot youd hook up a microcontroller like an arduino running your program to a battery some motors sensors and some kind of flipper.For engineering purposes id recommend you buy an arduino kit that comes with some basic circuits and a beginners book like the one on adafruityoull be able to do some simple projects like setting up your controller to tell some LED lights to blink at a certain rate and all.  Dont be too intimidated by the information here. The important part is you pick up some basic programming and circuitry knowledge.

The amount of charge that is stored in a capacitor is determined by the Farad rating of the capacitor. In this case your capacitor can hold  x  Farads. Note that the charge is not the same as the stored voltage or stored energy. The voltage rating of the capacitor is how much voltage that capacitor can take before bad things happen.  ESR  equivalent series resistance. Even though capacitors store energy they are limited by how quickly they can do this by its internal resistance. ,ElectricalEngineering,cycd4jj,2,t5_2sey9
6116763,0,t3_3z8u9g,The turntable puts out a very quiet signal called a phono signal. The RCA jack is just the type of plug  it doesnt tell you anything about the signal being carried through those wires.You MUST connect the turntable to the input labeled Phono on your receiver  any other connection wont work because the other inputs dont know how to deal with the very tiny very quiet signal from the turntable.From there you need to get a signal from the receiver to your computer speakers. If your computer speakers have a power jack and use a little wall wart or plug to get electricity then they are powered speakers and you should use the Tape Rec connections on the receiver connected to the input on your computer speakers. Those are both line level a medium power signal. Tape Rec used to be used to connect to a tape player so you could make recordings but it also works as an aux out for connecting external selfpowered speakers.The speaker connections on your receiver are high power output if you just stick the wires from those into something that isnt expecting that high power like an auxlinelevel input youll fry it.

Theres digital logic which is what pulls in the data and does the heavy lifting some analog aspects which control the oscillator and in essence interfaces everything then theres power electronics which is what powers stuff. This is its tricky is because youre asking for how different systems really interact when most people focus on one or two.Most modern designed chips have digital and analog components although you can still create logic and other crazy stuff with just analog but its harder to design reliably over production variations of the device. This is why you get a lot of chips that are as much analog as needed then everything else is digital.On top of that for example to set an analog voltage you have a bunch of resistors in a chip that you can incrementally short one more or one less to ground or positive power one or the other. They change by turning on transistors and digitally stepping by a fraction of a voltage. This in turn can change .V to .V or similar.Since its multiple areas I dont really have a good book aside from picking up as much as you can in each. Let me look at my old college books to see if I can find something probably wont be able to for a week. Otherwise looking into how a microcontroller works is great start. IE an arduino.

7842749,0,t3_4mqa1b,Alright so I am an Electrical Engineering student but I am also a mechanic and ect. So you have an electric motor that turns that wheel you accelerate this uses energy normal stuff.But motors are cool if you put electricity on them they spin which makes the wheels go round and round. So what happens when you do the reverse? Regenerative Breaking. So when you apply the brakes the brakes are KIND of working but the motor generates electricty which uses up some of the rotational energy and does slow the car down on its own some the rest of the braking energy if you will is wasted as heat during the interaction with the brakes.So if you apply electricity to a motor it rotates if you apply rotates to the motor it generates electricty.As far as losses I am not that far in school but there are always losses because phyiscs. As far as assuming no losses well this is where it is tricky. Losses were? You use energy overcoming wind friction from the tires bearing losses drivetrain losses. So you lose that energy coming and going when trying to accelerated and when trying to generate energy. Those are all just mechanical losses there are electrical losses as well. So if somehow a system worked were there existed no frictional and electrical loss of energy would the energy potential speed of the car end up in the batteries? I do not think so from what I know of hybridelectric systems that brakes still engage and will end up using some energy but I could be wrong but I doubt it.,ElectricalEngineering,d3xldde,1,t5_2sey9

8546633,0,t1_d69vaho,Thank you for your thorough response that makes sense. Makes me realize I just have more questions though...I understand how the computer circuitry routes and stores the high or low amplitudes of voltage in advanced logic gates to perform certain actions. However I dont understand electricity well at all and am confused on how a computer sends another computer bits on a wire? Wouldnt the clock cycles of each communicating computers CPUs have to be synced? How are the bits represented on the wire? Does it have to do with alternating current?

My GPA isnt thaaaaaat bad yet mostly saved by a good first and second year GPA but I feel like Im gonna continue falling behind. I think practical applications will really help me understand stuff better but the the labs for courses are usually done in pairs and Im reluctant to take my time to tinker and understand stuff fully out of courtesy of my partners who are usually top of the class guys.

Put another way there is practical engineering design implementation manufacturing etc and there is theoretical engineering heavy in research. EETs and EEs can both do the practical engineering but EEs have the additional option of going into theoretical engineering. Long winded.

Research all of the codes on the ICs until you get a match for a datasheet. Some of those codes are datecodes andor lot codes.Data sheets will be your best friend on this effort.I saw a Phillips and an ST micro chip on that board too. The backside looks like mostly all jellybean components that are necessary for connecting the subcircuits together or enabling the ICs to operate.Figuring out what each section of the MB might be futile but you should get a general idea of Power uC or uP memory etcYour HP gizmo might not be the best example in the use of TI chips...

It never happened. There are many many more software engineers now than then. If we cant even make computers program themselves they wont be designing new computers any time soon. First principles is not any kind of argument as these cannot be expressed in a way the computer can naturally make use of. A project has to be expressed in actionable form a computer can follow and thats a human job for the foreseeable future.I dont even know of anyone seriously researching what you seem to think is somehow inevitable or straightforward.
