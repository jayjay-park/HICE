Poor Moon is a side project made by Christian Wargo and a lot of their songs have a sort of Fleet Foxes feel to them. Father John Misty is J Tillman under a new name. His songs also have a sort of folkish Fleet Foxes feeling but is less of the harmonies and is more soloy with backup vocals. I believe he has a new album coming out soon as well. Hope that helps!,FleetFoxes,cmi5a0p,4,t5_2shhy
