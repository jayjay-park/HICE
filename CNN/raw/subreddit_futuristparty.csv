663450,0,t1_cgfoaqw,Most libertarians would say yes it would go against the tenants of political Libertarianism. But some people believe that a baseincome would provide greater liberty to citizens. This is usually described as Libertariansocialism which may be what Murray would consider himself. Also I think he may just realize that there are other possible options to end poverty and sees this as a possibility to his Libertarian views.,futuristparty,cgfomi5,3,t5_2v3ca

Yea the security problem is well....a problem. Biometric scanning would be ideal but the current state of it is...sort of sketchy.Fingerprint identification and scanning is actually extremely error prone. The current method of fingerprint iding can actually have multiple people with the same fingerprint. There are new technologies which are finding ways to analyze the interior of the finger ridges but it has not really gotten very far yet.The other factors could work but I guess with a large array of measurements it would sort of regress and average out to be correct.Maybe there will discover some new identity marker another unique fingerprint that is easily measurable.,futuristparty,chju12u,2,t5_2v3ca

As for the tides of change resulting in a UBI I suppose you are more optimistic that me. The two issues you mentioned relate to the expansion of personal freedom this is mass payments from the federal govt so much more entrenched resistance philosophically. Poverty reduction however is something of a soft spot for almost everyone. ,futuristparty,chztbyq,1,t5_2v3ca
1203300,0,t1_ci4w0e9,I love your pragmatism. Why reinvent the wheel if someone has already done the work for you? gt I believe the only solution is a technology one I cannot see people involved systems getting there.I sort of think that the technology alone cannot help us. In the hands of the wrong people or organizations this kind of technology can cause a great deal of harm. We need a universal ethical philosophy behind the technology or else the tools that could otherwise liberate us will end up being used to further silence our voice. In any case I hope you will work with the FP to further your vision of Privacy Security and Freedom.Cheers and thanks for doing what you do ,futuristparty,ci4zmq1,2,t5_2v3ca
1210100,0,t3_27yf3l,This visualization really shows the inherent problems with having the twoparty democracy like the US does. I put that in quotes because there are way more than two parties but the DemsGOP are so dominant that any rd party representative has to side with one major party or the other for their vote to have any sort of meaning. Not to mention that a lot of the minor parties are just smaller branches of the two major parties think Tea Party and side with their parent party on most issues. If we really wanted to stop all the gridlock in Washington we would get rid of the filibuster rule because we all know that rule is complete bullshit and ideally push more and more parties into the mix until we end up with more varying opinions that need to work together to achieve something rather than two polarized parties that will work against each other to halt the others progress simply because its the other partys idea so it must be bad. The twoparty system may have been workable in the th and th century but the country had a much smaller population and therefore fewer descenting opinions. Its time to shake things up a bit if we want to see any real progress in the next decade.,futuristparty,ci5r6a1,9,t5_2v3ca
1210217,0,t1_ci4xw1p,Exactly. Specifically MaidSafe is vulnerable to a sidechannel attack on their network stackUser A encrypts lolcats.png a common reposted cat image. Malware A sniffs the encrypted lolcats.png before it is shredded on the MaidSafe network and communicates that to User B. User B then encrypts the same file could be grabbed by Malware A or even supplied by Malware A with their own private key and sniffs the data prior to upload. Now User B can reverse engineer the private key of User A. User B has known plaintext for both ciphertexts and has  key for his own. Matter of time to generate the valid decryption key for User A which would allow User B to impersonate and steal all of User As data. And their Data to Data encryption just makes this entire process take less time.,futuristparty,ci5rncm,0,t5_2v3ca

1271372,0,t1_cicmmuh,See I was really really hoping youd mention the Soviet Union precisely because it was NOT really a socialist country in the sense that most socialists use the term  there was no worker control of production and it was mostly a statecapitalism country that incidentally was an oligarchy.  Noam Chomsky has written an excellent article about the situation hereChina has never been an actual communist country.  Its always been a capitalist oligarchy run by a oneparty state.  Theyve also been accused many many times of manipulating their currency which is pretty much the exact opposite of letting capitalistic market forces work.  It also hasnt decreased that pollution you mentioned any.North Korea is an absolute dictatorship.  Any suggestions that its in any way a communist state is intellectually dishonest.,futuristparty,cicna56,3,t5_2v3ca

1275428,0,t1_cid0r45,This is the only part I cant just agree to disagree on. gtgt Why do I think people prefer life versus death. This is what you are saying makes sense? gtI cant even... it seems I need to keep evidence of your testimonials if I want to get anywhere.gtYou asked if it isnt possible for people to vote for something evilZodaikos said that eugenics policies werent a serious concern because they have to be voted on hence my question. If people can vote for evil things then such policies must be carefully guarded against.  Then you asked if there was an obvious consensus that life is better than death shortly after talking about how ignorance produces bad policy. I thought the implication would be that if people werent informed that life was better than death there wouldnt be that consensus and thus people might vote to die. I would wager that many Europeans at the end of ww would have thought eugenics policies were absurd but it doesnt mean that hyper nationalism cant lead to ethnic cleansing as it has done in Yugoslavia and numerous African countries recently. gtgt In regards to your last point do you not think that people can vote for something evil? gtWhat I tried to make out of that example people prefer life over death except in some cases so you will really not see anyone advocating eugenics or any form of masskillings. Eugenics is a form of social darwinism that has no scientific backing. It sprung up from the idea that if you select the individuals with good traits against the negative ones youll have better chances of raising better offspring.You dont see any way that people might advocate to abort scientifically bad fetuses with genetic diseases chromosomal issues or any other sort of deformation? Or say girls like has been well documented in rural India and China? Terrible things like this happen all the time and society should protect against human natures worst instincts. Especially after the recent victories of radical and racist parties in the European parliamentary elections. We may know now that eugenics has no scientific basis but was that certain  years ago? I dont think so. What happens if we miss the next atrocity in our zeal to perfect human existence? ,futuristparty,cid3q04,2,t5_2v3ca
