877329,0,t1_cd5zppz,Not every Valley does that. We stopped giving the ring when the price of gold got too high. We give new  Masons a copy of Bridge to Light and the annotated Morals and Dogma instead.,scottishrite,ch40849,1,t5_2ujcf
2678014,0,t3_2jnh5s,gtFor one I dont drive. The Blue Lodge is at least  minutes away by public transportation if I make all of my connections. My SR temple is at least twice that and meetings start just one hour after my work day ends.Its fortyfive minutes to get to your Blue Lodge. Suck it up buttercup! Maybe carpool? Fortyfive minutes isnt that long. I have driven and transited over fortyfive minutes to Lodge on many occasions.gtFor anotherand this may sound sillyI hate suits. I own one for weddings and funerals and it fits fine but its suffocating. I grew up in a culture that despised suits and work in another that does.Get the fuck over yourself. I couldnt care less if we had a dress code of wearing silly pink hats...the important thing is uniformity and being on the level.gtMostly though Im weird. I have Asperger syndrome to some degree. Im uncomfortable in new situations not very social painfully shy very intelligent and just...different. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus then Im from Alpha Centauri. I managed to make it through my Blue Lodge degrees by a combination of sheer willpower and a rare spell of normality and I made it through my Reunion basically by latching onto one poor unsuspecting Brother who was very helpful although probably somewhat confused. I havent been back since.Who the hell let you in? Antisocial and asocial people have no place in what is first and foremost a social organization. Some Lodge seriously shat the bed on guardign the West Gate.,scottishrite,cn84ycg,2,t5_2ujcf

4925160,0,t3_3i9xpr,So Im halfway through the MC  and the Symbolic Lodge.  If I understand correctly finishing those would suffice for doing the new Philosophy MC correct?  Does anyone know enough about the newly reworked MC to state if it has been redone enough to consider a retake of the new material just for learnings sake?,scottishrite,cufcsrm,1,t5_2ujcf
5267796,0,t1_cvkzws1,We only communicate the th and its the new version with the Sufis rather than the Druze. I attend a discussion group where we go over the degrees and we went over the th for two sessions. We read the new one first and the older one second.,scottishrite,cvl0pvh,3,t5_2ujcf
