2198558,0,t3_2k6thk,We didnt try to just stay in Canada. Im sure you could if youre willing to forego all possible travel but we had plans for border crossings and if youre rejected from entering the country it can hurt your application.  I ended up finding a job and an apartment in Niagara Falls  NY and wr are about an hour apart. One thing you can look at doing is bringing you SO to the US on a fiance visa living together for a year apply  then continue living together until your SO is approved as sponsor then split up for a bit so they can resettle in Canada so when youre approved you can move right away.EDIT Sorry meant to respond to your reply to me.

That being said you need to be able to prove that you still maintain ties to the United States and that you will still be able to support yourself while in Canada without working illegally. ,ImmigrationCanada,cr2blt0,2,t5_2w94s
4059154,0,t1_crgdi23,I would recommend have her staying in the US with you and sponsor you from outside of the country.Alternatively go into Canada and do nothing for  months on a Outland Application and have your PR USA applicants are very rarely over  months.Compare that to  years for Inland.  The OWP is not a guarantee that you will get it Some people are having issues getting it because CIC believes they are not on a valid status.What ever you do dont bring your tools across.  That would be a huge red flag.  The only exception to that is if you can find an employer that will get you a LMIA or work in a profession that is covered under NAFTA.,ImmigrationCanada,criz2dp,1,t5_2w94s

5719853,0,t3_3tgequ,Join the line I dont know much about illegal immigrants because Id rather not going if I have to be an illegal there but heres what I can tell you The only way I know for a student to apply for citizenship is by graduating from a Canadian University and even so you still have to live as a permanent resident for a couple of years after graduation before applying for citizenship.gt Under what terms can a work visa apply?If you get a valid job offer or through the Federal skilled workers program.gt If I get a student visa and find a work there how can this play in my favor for a citizenship?Only if you can work legally have a work permitgtYou must ...gt have gained your experience in Canada with the proper authorizationsourcegt Can someone living in Rio a place where more then  people die every day apply as a refugee?

10040056,0,t1_dbg83hn,USA isnt an eligible nationality. However citizens of noneligible countries are able to do a sponsored working holiday in which a recruiter authorized by International Experience Canada can process you themselves in exchange for extra fees leading to a one year nonrenewable open work permit.  of these people end up working in service industry in restaurants or ski resorts though.Depending on the job and your qualifications you may be able to apply for a restricted work permit under NAFTA. I would require more information to make an assessment. But in general unless this is a well paying job it isnt worth paying the necessary fees andor legal costs to get it done. ,ImmigrationCanada,dbg8uiu,1,t5_2w94s
10434982,0,t3_5pfo62,Hi there fellow American currently in process of immigrating. Theres a ton of info on the cic website regarding immigration. Id suggest first going to the Canadian immigration site and checking what skillsjobs are needed in Canada visit to see if you qualify. Im assuming itll be a little harder because neither of you guys are Canadian citizens. Maybe the best starting place is to invest in a consultation with an immigration firm. We are working with one in Toronto so Id thats the area youre headed message me and Ill give you their info if youd like. Good luck!!! ,ImmigrationCanada,dcqvic5,1,t5_2w94s

During my medical exam for Express EntryCEC I revealed a diagnosis that is has a reputation for being more serious that GADsocial anxiety. Im not medicated and the doctor said that it was unlikely to raise any flags unless I had been hospitalized for it or had trouble with employment.,ImmigrationCanada,ddoxy06,1,t5_2w94s
10947811,0,t3_5wcpxx,First see if you qualify Generally you need to have an English language test result and  year of skilled work experience in order to express your interest in applying. Meeting the minimum requirements does not mean that you will be able to apply however. The inventory of applications is managed through the express entry system such that only the highest ranked candidates can apply. You can estimate your points here and compare that with the latest draws hereIf you have lived with your girlfriend for  year or more she may be your commonlaw partner. In that case you can immigrate to Canada as her dependent ifwhen she applies for permanent residence. She can apply through the express entry system above or could perhaps qualify for through a provincial nominee program. There are a few provinces that programs for Foreign nationals in who complete their PhD. See Ontario who has a program for PhD graduates generally and BC which has it for specific subjects. While she is studying in Canada you can join her on a work permit if you are her commonlaw partner. ,ImmigrationCanada,de96tmk,3,t5_2w94s

11196162,0,t1_df118hm,As far as I remember you dont need that to get a working holiday. Where are you from if you dont mind me asking? Because the working holiday isnt available to everyone but as far as Ive heard most countries have a similar alternative it just might have different requirements. As for residency not having a college degree or professional skill could be an issue. So with the tiny bit I can piece together about you Id suggest finding if you have an option to get a temporary working visa move to Canada and gain a years experience in a skilled position that gives you a really good chance of applying for residency. Otherwise if you could find a job to sponsor you in Canada you could have a really good chance too.  ,ImmigrationCanada,df12l0j,1,t5_2w94s
