As far as the math sequences which I was already worried about I most likely dont have those taken care of.

Only one of the two courses may be repeated.If youre not in the major theres nothing that you yourself can do at this point to remedy this semester.Either way I highly highly suggest talking to Esmaili anyall academic counselors and anyone else in your supporting group CAPS psych. counselor parents friends etc. Talking to Esmaili is the only thing you can do now that may have any effect on your grades and theres no telling if hell help you out until you do so. Most of the CS professors are pretty nice but as you can imagine there is a limit. Go in with grit but prepare for possible disappointment. Absolutely make sure to explain your circumstance and also your performance in other classes remember to show that when you applied yourself you excelled.The other people I suggested you talk to can offer their advice or suggest an alternative course of action nobody here can definitively offer. They will help to catch you and possibly rebound you. If you seek counselors I must advocate strongly that you approach multiple counselors from multiple departments. They will all offer you different opinions and not all of them know what theyre doing either.

For math the recitation sizes are usually  and  TA goes over homeworkclass material. For chemistry you do workshop assignments in groups of  and multiple TAs in the room. The entire room probably has around ish. In my experience class size wasnt that important. You can still ask questions during lecture and go to Professors office hours and email regularly they wont ignore you. So you cant really say size has a negative impact on performance since you always have resources for extra help either ProfsTAsTuroting etc. To add to all this a lot of the people I know in the school including my self are self taught.

Your station near you may just be rented out. There arent enough bikes to fill every station or else people wont be able to return the bike when they get to the station so the supply is limited.

11371529,0,t1_dfkdgfi,A guy who studied electrical engineering generations ago was doing this stuff long before that. Who did this stuff professionally that long ago says daisy chaining is dangerous  obviously.  If power strips contain protector parts then danger increases.  Threat is cited as a human safety violation by fire marshals and the electrically educated.  It even killed  some doges in a kennel.I need not explain why if your education is as claimed.  Even experience demonstrates why daisy chained power strips have cause fires and death.An example was ignored apparently due to electrical ignorance.  Some incandescent bulbs not motorized appliances demand  amps on power up  and never trip a  or  amp breaker.In some venues only a few power strips are so dangerous as to be banned.  If a power strip is required in those venues then new wall receptacles must be installed.  This is not required in most venues.  But again every power strip better damn well have a  amp breaker  to protect human life. One can run  stop signs.  That does not prove ignoring stop signs is acceptable.  Never make a conclusion from observation.  Unfortunately many do  and then claim a daisy chained power strip is safe.Never daisy chain power strips  except in rare cases as only temporary power monitored by a human presence.,SBU,dfkxwqx,1,t5_2sa4t
11371615,0,t1_dfkxwqx,So you actually have no idea why?LOL.You dont need to worry about an incandescent bulb burning things down from current draw.  The reason that chaining the power strips is bad is that you can use more outlets to load a single line.  Stop making things up.,SBU,dfky9db,1,t5_2sa4t

When it comes down to it your experience at SB like any other thing in life is what you make of it. If you dont have a car its going to be a gigantic pain in the ass relying on others and public transport. If you put in work to make it the stereotypicallivingoncampuscollege experience itll be fine. If you dont itll easily be very isolating especially without a car. Moral of the story get a car and put effort into your time here to make it what you want it to be. ,SBU,dg2rwn8,3,t5_2sa4t
