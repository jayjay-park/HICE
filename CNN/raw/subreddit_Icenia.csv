4941040,0,t3_3iju8v,IGN LennedParty IndependentState IceniaExperience About  days on Icenia  years on civcraft overall. I was previously a Lord in the commonwealth my borough was seaside.Goals Create a city wide snitch group to be able to fight crime more easily. Have free basic resources for newfriends and citizens available such as food and beds. Recreate the dark oak farm someone replaced it with regular oak last time I checked. In addition we should create larger tree farms for types of wood other than spruce. Help build a town ore smelter. Though there is already an ore smelter nearby in Orion having one would boost our economy and lower our dependence on Orion. Improve infrastructure like building new bridges in the south east of Icenia to the wastelands instead of the current dirt bridges. I like the idea of a central bank where people can deposit their valubles and keep them safer than if they kept them in their house. I will look into if this is feasible. Id like to see Icenia become a hub of sorts for . We need to increase trade with the nations around us and improve transportation to them through new rails and roads. Ice roads are very convenient.Thanks for reading!,Icenia,cuhcver,1,t5_38v5q
