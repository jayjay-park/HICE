480497,0,t3_1zm5g4,One of the most fascinating debates of the Soviet period is that of the problems of nationalities. Lenin had been thoroughly in favour of the rights of separate nationalities for them to have their own republics for those republics to have every right available to themeven the right to secede from the USSR though there was never any question of this happening.Though youre right nationalism was not a part of the Communist ideologyit was more commonly referred to as social chauvinism  not the feminist sense but a kind of aggressive patriotism. The point was with the coming of the revolution the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat there would be a period of chauvinism but it would slowly wither away with the achievement of class consciousness. There was even a minister for nationalities and this got interesting when a littleknown at the time man called Joseph Stalin was appointed to this role. Though he initially promoted Lenins line soon after and this was before Lenin was dead becoming one of the indicators of Stalins ruthlessness and reasons for Lenins dying attempt to remove him from power he changed tact. From then on he dictated that all nationalisms should be subordinated to the principles of socialism if I paraphrase correctly meaning an almost total end to the rights of minorities and the beginning of what would come later the forceful Russianisation of minorities and the nearexplicit Russian domination of the USSR.Whats interesting is that years later in a region riddled with national problems Joseph Titoin his bid to be the best disciple of the USSRwould actually follow a totally different route knowing that national domination was one of the worst forms and Stalin chastised him for it. The collapse of Titos system rather simplistically led to whatre know as the Yugoslav wars of the s in Bosnia and Kosovo. ,history,cfuvw52,26,t5_2qh53

680563,0,t3_21vss7,For WWI books I would suggest All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque and A. W. Wheen. A great and thrilling memoir of a German soldiers experiences in the Western trenches.Storm of Steel by Ernst Jnger. Another great German memoir of combat in WW.For a movie experience I havent seen many on WW but I did see Regeneration  which is based on the fictional book. The story showcases in effective detail the mental and emotional toll combat takes on men seen from the eyes of a British Army psychiatrist treating mentally disturbed soldiers returning from the front. There is some combat scenes but the movies true power is how it portrays mental illness within the human condition. The movie is also titled Behind the Lines and is available on instant stream on Netflix. The other movie The Lost Battalion  isnt a stereotypical trench warfare film but has some edge of your seat combat scenes as a lost American battalion of soldiers fights through German Lines to reconnect with the main army. The movie is based on a true story.,history,cghmplr,1,t5_2qh53

736646,0,t1_cgkvl4o,Reading through your old posts as you suggested and it seems like the issue is differing definitions of Golden Age. I think youre improperly taking this term out of its applicable context.We use the term Golden Age primarily to refer to a culture or civilization with respect to itself and its own history not solely with respect to other cultures of the time and certainly not with respect to modern times which is what it seems you are doing. The prosperity of say the US of A today would qualify as the greatest Golden Age compared to all previous human civilizationscultures but nobody seriously makes that comparison and certainly nobody today would say the USA is going through a Golden Age because our ideals are much higher than where we actually are.When a culture goes through a distinguished period of prosperity and advancement we tend to label it as a distinct period from the rest of its history. The term Golden Age has come into use for that.Nobody educated anyway in their right mind associates Golden Age with flawless human advancement and civilization which is where youve moved the goalposts. The Mongols had an extremely prosperous period and in hindsight when far removed from the events in question some might even romanticize it but the fact of their unmatched slaughter of human life which makes all other civilizations of that time pale in comparison obviously puts that into the context of their time.Simply and crudely put because these mistakes youve made are not those of a historian acting like barbarians in a barbaric time is not anything special or noteworthy. The more unbarbaric acts are achieved the more noteworthy historical peoples become. The Islamic Golden Age certainly qualifies. Barbarism typical of the time in which they lived i.e inhumane conduct of war discrimination etc does not distract from everything else noteworthy about the period. Your logic seeks to abolish a very useful term altogether for no reason I can identify other than perhaps some personal emotional bias. This is also the reason I use the term barbarism here since I think it would appeal to your personal agenda.,history,cgo0dx1,1,t5_2qh53
747452,0,t1_cgoq54h,gtThe reason being that the Constitution enumerates no power to the Federal government giving them purview over the regulation of slavery.Yes because the constitution barely directly enumerates any power to the Federal government relative to that which it exercises in practice. The vast majority of constitutional powers are implied you cant just go around writing congress is allowed to write this law and this law and this law and this law... in a constitution itd be completely impractical. And theres a reason our constitution is the shortest in the world its purposefully vague and nonspecific because the people writing it didnt agree with each other and so wanted to leave room for future interpretation as needed. Its not some infallible document handed down from on high just a bundle of compromises needed to keep our federation in more or less working order. Theres certainly nothing forbidding the federal government from abolishing slavery and the Necessary and Proper and Supremacy clauses rather imply that it can. gtYou also have to keep in mind that while slavery was a key component of the souths decision to secede neither the Lincoln administration nor those states remaining in the Union went to war to free slavery  they went to war to preserve the union. Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply ignorant of history or a revisionist. I never said they did it was a war to preserve the union. That doesnt change the fact that the reason the southern states seceded in the first place the direct cause of the war was the desire to preserve slavery. And anyone who suggests otherwise is simply ignorant of history or a revisionist. ,history,cgp8ply,1,t5_2qh53

822294,0,t1_cgxpjtm,gtOPs source clearly has a bias towards the protesters accountsthe fallacy here is the presumption that reality is neutral. Again we sympathise with massacres we account those who died not because of a bias but because it was a reality  by trying to equalise things between victims and their attackers we implicitly take the side of the attackers. Secondly any bias can be the result of the reality and not the other way round. We sympathise with the Nazi resistance because we understand the reality not because we sympathise with them in the abstract. The fact is most of society is organised against the recognition of this type of history. Youre unlikely to ever see it in any schools and probably any universities its absent from most of histories especially mainstream ones. What we choose to remember what we consider history is political. I certainly have a bias that Americas bloody labour history the deaths and murder and struggles of millions of people silently wiped from the annals from public memory is a historical reality I seek to correct...however the attempt to remove the bias of one direction isnt an attempt to recreate it in the other. For many people assume that merely talking about this heterodox history implies a bias.

1050069,0,t3_2643zg,There is a legend where im from about a battle won using bulls not riding them though more like making thousands of them stampede into the enemy.Quoting wikipedia hereBattle of Salga BayThe first military action in the Azores occurred about a year after Antnios crushing defeat at Alcntara. A Spanish fleet of ten warships commanded by Pedro Valdez bombarded Angra on  July  then began investigating the coast of the island in search of the best landing places. At dawn on  July the first ships loaded with Spanish troops anchored in Salga Bay about twelve kilometres east of Angras harbour in the village of Vila de So Sebastio. A coastwatcher stationed at the cape called Ponta do Coelho gave the alarm but when the first Portuguese forces arrived about one thousand Castilians had already landed and had started to sack the surrounding villages. In this phase of the fighting according to local accounts of the action a leading role was played by young and pretty Brianda Pereira who together with other women attacked the enemy with farm implements when she saw her house destroyed.By midmorning the Spaniards were sweeping the coast with their artillery and the fighting was fierce. About midday when the outcome of the battle was still unsettled an Augustinian monk named Friar Pedro who was taking an active part in the struggle thought of the stratagem of driving cattle against the Spaniards so as to scatter them. Over a thousand head of cattle were quickly gathered and by means of shouts and musket shots driven against the enemy positions. The disconcerted Spaniards fell back and were pursued to the shore where almost all of them lost their lives in the fighting or drowned while trying to reach their boats. This unconventional victory the Battle of Salga Bay proved that Antnio could count on a good deal of local support.,history,chnnbok,4,t5_2qh53

1078552,0,t1_chpobzb,In fact the air assaults on Japanese cities combined were not small or mildly effective. Those were huge and the damages were tremendous but the Japanese where to stubborn to surrender. The firebombing of Tokyo was worse then the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  people died in a single bombardment. Over a million people lost their homes. Most Japanese cities had been bombed to pieces by the time the atomic bombs were used. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen because there was still something left to be bombed there.  As to an answer to your question The Mariana Islands were conquered a lot sooner and it was close enough to Japan to launch attacks from there. They already made the preparations like rebuiling airfields to serve hundreds of bombers it would make not much sense to have to do that all over again in Iwo Jima while the Mariana Islands were also close enough to Japan. ,history,chqvur3,2,t5_2qh53

Granted a good deal of it was speculative and it would have been more fitting programming for discovery channel but overall it was pretty entertaining and also informative in that it demonstrated the fragility of our modern civilization and raised interesting questions regarding how wed be remembered in ages to come. They ran out of ideas near the end but the original made for tv documentary that inspired the show is definitely worth a watch.

Later in life is when he switched sides and favored the Arians and the bishop who eventually baptized him was Arian. All of this was happening while Athanasius was exiled by him.Here is an excerpt from the Catholic EncyclopediaBut the wiles of Eusebius who in  recovered Constantines favour were seconded by Asiatic intrigues and a period of Arian reaction set in. Eustathius of Antioch was deposed on a charge of Sabellianism  and the Emperor sent his command that Athanasius should receive Arius back into communion. The saint firmly declined. In  the heresiarch was absolved by two councils at Tyre and Jerusalem the former of which deposed Athanasius on false and shameful grounds of personal misconduct. He was banished to Trier and his sojourn of eighteen months in those parts cemented Alexandria more closely to Rome and the Catholic West. Meanwhile Constantia the Emperors sister had recommended Arius whom she thought an injured man to Constantines leniency. Her dying words affected him and he recalled the Lybian extracted from him a solemn adhesion to the Nicene faith and ordered Alexander Bishop of the Imperial City to give him Communion in his own church . Arius openly triumphed but as he went about in parade the evening before this event was to take place he expired from a sudden disorder which Catholics could not help regarding as a judgment of heaven due to the bishops prayers. His death however did not stay the plague. Constantine now favoured none but Arians he was baptized in his last moments by the shifty prelate of Nicomedia and he bequeathed to his three sons  an empire torn by dissensions which his ignorance and weakness had aggravated.,history,cjk8ujp,3,t5_2qh53

But was adopted by Nerva on his death bead because he was the greatest general in the empire. Nerva did not know him at all really. Septimius Severus   ad Seized power after the Praetorian guard tried to install one of their own. Was able to outfight the Praetorian Guard in the field. Philip I   ad Seized power with the help of his legions after the death of Gordian the rd. Claudius Gothicus  ad Victorious general at Battle of Naissus seized power after Gallienuss death. Aurelian  ad Took power after Quintillus came from peasant stock. One lots of great battles. Diocletian  ad Took power after a series of power grabs by other generals.

1802638,0,t3_2f6ixn,Or how about not declaring war on the US when Japan attacked the US? An even easier solution. Sure Hitler would be breaking the spirit of the Tripartite Pact but he showed to only respect pacts when it suited him before MolotovRibbentrop for instance. Americans were were very resistant to get involved in European affairs and Germany not declaring war on the US may have kept the US focused on Japan for a while and out of the European conflict. Many German generals thought it was a mistake to go after the US.,history,ck6dh1q,7,t5_2qh53

1804953,0,t1_ck6ej5s,gt Assessment All said that this proposition receives the same judgement in philosophyDo you know what this even means? Philosophy here refers to natural philosophy  what wed today call science.And the scholars that it offended? Aristotelians. Galileo was gifted at pissing people off and he made a number of enemies over the years with his comments about their remarkable stupidity and the like.As Ive said repeatedly the first trial was over whether Galileo could hold heliocentrism to be established truth or as a hypothesis. Bellarmine found no problem with heliocentrism so long as it was treated as a purely hypothetical calculating device and not as a physically real phenomenon but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards....which it could not be. Bellarmine rightly acknowledged that the theory would upset the establishment and wanted to proceed cautiously especially since the scientific evidence wasnt in Galileos favor.Ingoli presented a number of scientific objections to Galileo as well which he did not answer for the trial.The  ruling that heliocentrism is foolish and absurd in philosophy means it is a scientific finding not a religious one. The religious arguments against heliocentrism were present but were not the core issue.Heres Galileos own description of what happened in   The occasion for discussing with the said cardinals was that they wanted to be informed about Copernicuss doctrine his book being very difficult to understand for those who are not professional mathematicians and astronomers. In particular they wanted to understand the arrangement of the heavenly spheres according to Copernicuss hypothesis how he places the sun at the center of the planets orbits how around the sun he places next the orbit of Mercury around the latter that of Venus then the moon around the earth and around this Mars Jupiter and Saturn and in regard to motion he makes the sun stationary at the center and the earth turn on itself and around the sun that is on itself with the diurnal motion and around the sun with the annual motion.And he was indeed allowed to still research heliocentrism as long as he did not put it forth as accepted fact. This came up in the  trial as he was accused of holding as true heliocentrism.Heres how Galileo put it in his own words  Lord Cardinal Bellarmine told me that Copernicuss opinion could be held suppositionally as Copernicus himself had held it. His Eminence knew that I held it suppositionally namely in the way that Copernicus held it as you can see from an answer by the same Lord Cardinal to a letter of Father Master Paolo Antonio Foscarini Provincial of the Carmelites I have a copy of this and in it one finds these words I say that it seems to me that Your Paternity and Mr. Galileo are proceeding prudently by limiting yourselves to speaking suppositionally and not absolutely.  This letter by the said Lord Cardinal is dated  April . Moreover he told me that otherwise namely taken absolutely the opinion could be neither held nor defended.,history,ck6nruz,0,t5_2qh53

Makes very good sense with a very small conventional force to handle small diplomaticflare up situations.Id say the primary reason is that Sweden wanted to get itself on the sidelines of the war and emphasize the export market for its conventional arms.

His efforts as a diplomat were more than likely the saving grace of the American Revolution.

This was due to the fact that they were living in unimaginably horrific conditions for indefinite periods of time. This is when commanders first realized that they need to rotate troops so they dont succumb to battle fatigue. The most common treatment of this condition was being shot because they just thought it was a manifestation of cowardice. Its hard for me to imagine fighting back then.,history,clc3bx2,4,t5_2qh53

He would take them to a life raft.At one point he was completely separated from his friends and only open water was around him. Luckily an ocean swell rose him high enough to see in the distance his buddies and he swam like hell!He also told me that when a Japanese ship came near close enough for him to touch it he had to dive underwater until it would pass because they were shooting the men in the life rafts and running over the groups of huddled men in the life rafts..

However there is merit to the fact that Hitlers decision that Russia would become a threat later was verified by Stalins decision to try and annex Finland who I am pretty sure was supposed to be in Germanys sphere. The incompetence and weakness of the Red Army only gave Hitler proof that a first strike would bring a quick and easy victory.,history,clkphf6,3,t5_2qh53

2265855,0,t3_2l5rnb,One point that I havent seen mentioned elsewhere is the American presence in the Philippines. Not only did Japan want the Philippines for its strategic value but also Malaysia further south for its resources including oil rubber and tin. Remember that Japan is relatively resourcepoor when it comes to heavy industrial manufacturing and relies heavily on import.Even if the IJN was to sail around the Philippines leaving it completely unscathed on the way to Malaysia theres no way MacArthur stationed in Manila would have let this pass unhindered it would have been a security threat not only to the Philippines but also to Australian allies  further south. This meant that taking the Philippines was not an option. The only way to realistically take and hold the Philippines is to ensure no reinforcements from Hawaii hence Pearl Harbor. Youll note that the attack on Manila began on December th. The idea was that the United States would be too busy reeling from the loss of a significant portion of their Pacific Fleet to care at all about the Philippines.If the Japanese command made any errors in their thinking they were  in underestimating American response to the attack. They didnt believe that the United States could rebuild a fleet as quickly as they did and they certainly didnt believe that they could effectively project power from  miles away Hawaii rather than merely  miles Philippines and most importantly they didnt think that they would bother trying  at least not in the short term. Supply lines that long especially over water significantly weaken forces. Japan was banking on the fact that it wouldnt be worth it for the United States to retaliate.,history,clrs2lp,5,t5_2qh53

In  the breaking of the wall was a sign of the end of the Cold War unfortunately it seems were heading towards bringing it back again. Cell phones In  I had to be on call for my first job out of college they gave me this big phone that was the coolest thing to have and would turn heads wherever I went. I could call anyone at anytime! Internet When I started using the internet in  I didnt realize how big it would become. I remember being in awe the first time I realized I could buy something that would be delivered to my house if I just pushed the little mouse button. Smartphones When a friend an Apple fanboi came to my office in  saying Apple had just announced a new phone that was going to be revolutionary I smirked as he said the same thing after every Apple event... except that that particular time he was right. Netflix streaming When Netflix asked me to fill a questionnaire asking if I would rather use streaming than DVDBlurays I said physical media as I believed the quality was much better and also by streaming I would miss on all the extra features available in DVD...

You could get a job as a teacher or go further and work towards a Masters or PhD but you may want to talk to an adviser or professor about this first.  You could get a job as a teacher or writer.  Or you could find employment within the government or a private interest as a researcher or analyst.

The Americans on the other hand were at the height of their redscare fanaticism especially after losing China and were doing anything and everything to stamp out any leftist political movements in South Korea. They even abolished workers unions in South Korea to the point where Korean workers had less rights than American workers while under the USAMGIK.

The way its taught in the US is that there was no knowledge of this at all prior to the war.  The US didnt enter WW in order to liberate the Jews and we didnt know anything about concentration camps until we were actually on the ground in Europe years into the conflict.Rather the US tried sitting on the fence during the opening days of the war and provided resources to the Allies.  The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese was a step too far and the American people demanded retribution.A theory Ive heard is that some of the higherups in the USA had prior knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor but let it happen anyway in order to whip up some nationalistic fury amongst the American public and force the US into war.

No nation of appreciable size had ever operated as a democracy.An entire federation of independent states all voting on  set of laws however was an idea so out of this world that no one thought it could work.

The programs he supported took both goals into account. The highway system he championed was a major asset to moving military equipment anywhere in the US but it also increased interstate trade.

Its much crazier than that. After the revolution they have a few years as a republic what do they do they put Napoleon in power and then crown him King a little over a decade after they got rid of the Monarchy. Napoleon rules for almost  years gets defeated by pretty much all of Europe and what do these countries do to the self made Emperor they let him go into Exile and back comes the Bourbon Monarchy to France. Less than a year later Napoleon walks back into France and says Lets try this again the fucking people rally around him.  days later he gets his ass kicked again at Waterloo. What do the countries of Europe do to him this time? Exile again and now were back to the good old Bourbon Monarchy in France. The madness isnt over yet  years later theres another revolution the King goes into exile and France elects a new President fucking Louis Napoleon Nephew of and heir of Napoleon. A few years as president and guess what happens Louis Napoleon declares himself Emperor and rules France until  when he goes to war against Germany loses gets captured and you guessed it gets exiled to England. The third Republic of France starts  years after the first revolution and they finally had a true Republic at least until Germany came back  years later.,history,cn2mnfx,433,t5_2qh53

2671024,0,t3_2qivug,I made quite a few rAskhistorians posts about this. gt Now lets get past all the fancy numbers and statistics for a second and really analyze whats going on and get to the meat of your question  why the heck didnt the Germans just go through the Netherlands? There were forts there certainly but not nearly at the level of Belgium and it would have allowed for a massively expanded front which would have spread out all those men and let them swing more naturally into Belgium and North France. Its likely it would have sped things up by a couple of days even and would not have required for such a desperate assault on Liege and later Dinant. Schlieffen himself actually saw no issue with this and included it in his original  plan. However Helmuth von Moltke saw issue with that. He recognized in the s that Britain would most likely become involved on the side of France after a breach of Belgian neutrality and they would perform a full blockade of Germany. They would have absolutely no way of dealing with the blockade their navy was simply not capable of contesting it. Thats where the Netherlands comes in  by not invading them and keeping them as a neutral border state Germany can trade for vital goods through the Netherlands who will retain full trading capacity with the rest of the world. It was sort of a back up plan in case things didnt go as well instead of going all in.gt Okay so we cant just avoid Liege which was really Germanys only issue with the Belgian military as an organized force  that has to be attacked. What about the French forts that they all attacked at Dunkirk and Maubeuge that red circle you see on the map that held out for a long ass time? Well youre kind of forced to deal with these forts as you pass them. They were attacked for the same reason any army attacked any fort in the history of the world instead of just bypassing it and continuing on with the offensive  it holds tens of thousands of men. In the case of Maubeuge almost  men and with similar stories in other French forts. If you just walk past them those men are now behind your lines and can cause havoc. It is a projection of force in that region and if not dealt with allows the enemy to perform military operations with a place to fall back on safely and disrupts the entire offensive. It has to be dealt with or you just get pockets of  men popping up everywhere in critical areas like rivers crossings and major cities all behind your lines.gt This is actually precisely how the Germans would throw away their successful offensive. In early September the Germans would be on the outskirts of Paris also squared in purple and had the entire French army on its heels. Or rather on its heels. They had an option then  siege the fortress of Paris or continue to pursue the French armies push them further Southeast into the thth armies sitting on the FrenchGerman border and completely encircle everyone. The latter would require basically ignoring Paris and considering even minor forts took a significant amount of time to subdue and it would take days if not weeks to move the super heavy mm artillery necessary to even think about sieging Paris the Germans opted to completely ignore it and continue pursuing the French. This was a horrible option. The Parisian forces would notice that Bulows Second Army had given them their back as they turned South and Klucks First Army was separated from the rest of the pack just North of them too. They along with the entirety of the British Expeditionary Force would pour out of and around Paris into this gap and nearly encircle both the st and nd German armies. This is why they sieged all those forts before and its why people have been sieging forts since the beginning of time.gt A crash course background of the German plan The SchlieffenMoltke Plan called for a rapid deployment of forces the st and nd Armies with the rd augmenting them through Belgium to cause the rapid retreat of the French and ultimately their encirclement. They had  days to knock the French out so that they could swing their forces East and handle the Russians. It was more or less an all or nothing plan which worked on the assumption the French would roll over as they had done in  they were dead wrong. The French with the most sophisticated railway system in Europe would siphon men to Paris and generally the North as they tactically withdrew from the North bleeding out the Germans.gt At the Battle of the Marne the French would have nearly x as many field guns as the Germans where just  weeks prior those same armies outnumbered their own field guns by the same ratio as you can see it was a massive swing of the pendulum. The Germans would be nothing short of crushed at the Marne. The st army was entirely cut off from the nd in an attempt to perform an offensive. They ducked while the nd dived. Dipped while they dodged. Went right while the nd went left. They were both cut off and threatened with annihilation and had to retreat and rapidly that retreat turned into full rout at times.gt The premise is already kind of false the Germans were flexible to the Schlieffen Plan and to some that is precisely the issue. The original Schlieffen Plan released in  called for what is known as a swinging door strategy. The Germans would throw literally all they had through Holland and Belgium to rapidly get into North France in a surprise attack conquer Paris and goad the French into conquering parts of West Germany. As they were sufficiently over extended the Germans would swing in from behind with all they had and crush the French from behind giving them no retreat. This combined with a quick stealing of Paris and the French would be forced to surrender.gt Alfred von Moltke would radically alter this plans in the face of a changing landscale. The original Schlieffen Plan was idealistic  it was a perfect plan for a perfect world and a perfect timetable. It did not account for mistakes and further it allowed for many parts of West Prussia and Bavaria to be taken as a sort of sacrificial lamb  something many people did not like.gt Moltke also realized a few other issues with the plan. Firstly he would note that with violating Belgian neutrality Britain would almost certainly join the war effort which meant a blockade. The Germans were not breaking the blockade. The Germans would be starved of foodstuffs and war materials if they were blockaded. I think youre getting the picture here. The alternative he presented was that the Netherlands would not be invaded Holland left safe and Belgium the only country with its neutrality broken. This was done so that Germany could have a neighboring trading partner with open ocean access to get foodstuffs in particular from.gt Moltke would on top of this recognize that the Russians would not take almost  months to mobilize and could present a far more immediate threat. In combination with this he also realized that the idea of purposely and willingly giving up German territory was something impossible to ask for particularly because those who were to be intentionally retreating and giving up Bavarian land would be the Bavarian Army primarily and their Crown Prince performing the operation. The plan would be altered from a swinging door into a squeeze strategy. The Germans would oppose French incursions directly and perform a steadfast defense. They would not allow an inch of German territory to be given up willingly and would have bolstered defenses to do this. What was once an  ratio of Germans in the hammer and Germans defending in the anvil would be reduced to .gt During the war itself the plan would be adapted almost immediately. Crown Prince Rupprechts men were getting restless and wanted to attack French positions this required more men. Moltke would grant that request and direct men toward South to him to perform his maneuvers which were ultimately failures I should note. The Russians also mobilized quicker than even Moltke expected and he directed a few Corps from the st Army to East Prussia to assist with that. Hausen and Bulow of the rd and nd Armies respectively part of the hammer would take it upon themselves to seize initiative quite a few times which would provide alterations to the plan. Further Paris would overall be ignored as Generals felt it lacked real strategic importance and would be an unnecessary prolonged siege instead going for the overall encirclement of the French. This would leave their backs open to a Paris garrison that was significantly larger than they imagined and nearly had their entire st nd and rd Armies obliterated.cont. for TLDR,history,cn78519,1,t5_2qh53

2678203,0,t1_cn85pfm,Well luckily for us we have quite an extensive understanding of Roman history considering they wrote a lot of this down so yes I am certain. I wonder why youre on rhistory if youre wary of people making historical claims especially about easily the most documented and studied period of ancient history. If you want specific works you can read it from Caesars mouth himself in De Bello Gallico. As he explains Legionaires would be equipped with two javelinelike spears with bendable iron necks which made it harder to pull out and reuse.  Before handtohand combat with the enemy the Legionaries would hurl these spears at the enemy soldiers. With any luck these volleys would kill some enemy soldiers or sink into their shields the soft iron necks would bend and render shields to cumbersome to be of use. The enemy army was forced to fight at a disadvantage as most of the troops would simply abandon their shields. When the two groups clashed in handtohand combat no matter the amount of planning on either side fighting became hectic and confusing. Roman soldiers with their large square shields were much better protected than their enemy and thus needed a weapon that could be used efficiently in close quarters. Roman soldiers were trained never to slash with their weapons but only to stab. Stabbing allowed Roman soldiers to pierce heavier armors and dispatch enemies faster. Thus the Roman army adopted a short stabbing blade as their main weapon. The gladius allowed units of soldiers to become more flexible the great thing about attacking with a gladius being that the thrusting attacks did not interfere with the Roman battle line and allowed the legionaries to keep tight cohesion in battle.  Whereas if you look at Macedonian units with their distinctive huge spears each man had to be perfectly aligned in order for the formation to be effective. This is explicitly stated in Caesars own words you can buy the book on Amazon and read it yourself and is repeated consistently throughout all ancient Roman texts describing the military. ,history,cn85ud9,22,t5_2qh53

Same is actually still true in much of the world.Say did Rome ever use harshlabor like mining as criminal punishment?  Fantasyscifi is quite eager to have the hero throw into a mine as a slave thats just a given but I dont know how often this sort of thing was actually done.  Prisoners taken in war those became slaves I know that was true.  But criminal punishment for people inside the society who were not classed as slaves initially thats a different thing.  Showing any sort of class mobility is a dangerous thing.  A citizen being reclassed as a slave creates a tie between citizens and slaves a tie that can bring questions about the social order.,history,cngina8,4,t5_2qh53

They were perfectly happy with a stronger federal government if it meant securing slavery. Beliefs concerning the nature of the Union or compact of states certainly factor into the Southern decision to secede though as a major cause for secession this is only really applicable to the delayed secession of the states that seceded subsequent to Lincolns response to Ft.

Spoilers Basically the big turn of the film at the end is the idea that they can crack the transmissions based on the use of common words. This comes as some kind of revelation for the film and once thats figured out its easy. Actually the machine itself was built entirely on this principle. It looks for those repeated words to begin with rather than it being what made it work after being built. The cryptography in the film kind of dulled it for me because it was quite poor. That repeated word is effectively most of cracking simpler cryptography non digital stuff but its never mentioned. What also ruined stuff for me was the lack of much reference to the polish bomba The code breaking machine was  built upon a less powerful but still usable polish computing machine. What makes this even more annoying is that since then Ive heard an interview with cumberbatch on the nerdist podcast where he talks in depth about turing and also about the machine and makes explicit reference to the polish version of the machine.

2828807,0,t3_2sfpqd,The st Minnesota Infantry Regiment were pretty badass in the Civil War.  They participated in quite a few battles throughout the war they enlisted for  years which was unusually long for a volunteer regiment at the time but where they really showed their badassery was at Gettysburg. On the second day of the three day battle a brigade from Alabama had fought its way through to a creek at the base of Cemetery Hill routing union soldiers ahead of them. They were getting set to push up the hill and break the union lines they likely would have succeeded and they likely would have won the battle keep in mind Gettysburg is often thought of as the turning point of the Civil War. Unprepared to mount a defense the union general Winfield Hancock rode up to the regiment from Minnesota who were at the time positioned at the crest of the hill guarding artillery I believe although Im not sure and ordered them to charge the Confederates and take their colors. He was knowingly sending these  men to their deaths against a force of  in order to buy the time he needed to get men in position to defend the hill. Without question the regiment charged down the hill straight into the fire of the Alabama brigade. Upon reaching the brigade they engaged in closequarters combat with bayonets against the force that had them outnumbered by about  before both sides retreated. After the charge only  of the original  men were left the colonel and  of the  captains were among the casualties. The  casualty mark is still the highest for a single day of any surviving U.S. military unit. Despite the heavy casualties the unit once again saw combat on the third day of Gettysburg as they were again forced to charge a confederate force in response to Picketts Charge. Two of their men were awarded the medal of honor for their fighting that day. One for taking a Virginia infantry regiments flag this flag is still in the possession of the Minnesota Historical Society and has been the topic of legal debate as some Virginians want it back and the other for easing the fallen Minnesota units flag multiple times being injured and carrying an injured Union soldier back to Union lines.   tldr Outnumbered infantry division went on a suicide charge and survived barely at Gettysburg quite probably preventing a Union defeat.

2922716,0,t1_co05m0q,gt I am sure it goes back much further. For as long as humans have experienced warfare I am sure they would have also experienced emotional trauma.Actually likely a lot further than youre estimating.  For as long as mammals have encountered scary stuff they have experienced emotional trauma.  While ascription of emotions to animals can sometimes be unhelpfully anthropomorphic sticking to plain behavioral definitions of those emotions yeah theyve basically got them like we do.  PTSD is basically the least human mental illness weve got.  Theres a process we call fear learning that essentially represents a lot of the neurophysiological architecture of what we see at PTSD and fear learning happens quite robustly in all mammals and to some extent in other creatures as well.  In short when big loud salienttothesenses stuff happens that threatens you particularly but not necessarily with blood etc. your brain knows what blood is youre built to quickly learn to fear it.  Behaviorally fear means avoidance response so in other words youre built to avoid it.  Its conservativea cudgel not a scalpelso youre not meant to suspect that perhaps the tigers are only at the watering hole on Wednesdays but rather to simply stay the fuck away from the watering hole.  Like everything else the brain includes a series of offswitches too the assumption is that various contingencies and environmental pressures may end up nudging you back towards the watering hole if the avoidance isnt actively maintained.  This often happens in humans toomost people with diagnosable PTSD or acute stress disorder spontaneously recover likely in response to these natural contingencies.  Extra semirelated piece of knowledge usually we take several iterations to learn anything memorizing lines to a play or me teaching you to blink in response to a light by pairing it with an air puff etc.  There are only a couple of places in which we seem able to do what we sometimes call singlesession learning which is the acquisition of a learned response after only being taught once.  One is fear learning and the big other one is conditioned taste aversion first scientifically identified by the doctoral mentor of the guy who taught me grad physio.  Remember the last time you got puke sick?  Bet youre not currently a huge fan of the food you ate right before.Anyway combat traumaor more specifically trauma related to killing in combatdoes not work up there as far as we can tell in any qualitatively different way than other kinds.  Dave Grossmans book interesting though it is and mentioned in a comment here fails to make mention of this fact I think most of this has to do with killing others in combat but uhhh oh yeah... its basically the same PTSD if you do that or get blown up by an IED or get in a car accident stateside or get raped or watch your dad die of a heart attack.  This is not to say that certain events are not quantitatively more or less traumatogenic or dont include their own separate complications.  There are lots of stories floating around about dog PTSD and I sometimes get asked if thats plausiblegood lord of course its plausible.  Theyre wired up to quickly learn to fear and avoid things like we are.  Honestly this is one of the things you share most of with a rat.Probably the different thing for humans is our verbal lifesince verbal thoughts can be quite real to us we have the opportunity to fear verbalcognitive reminders of the trauma rather than just environmental cues.  That makes the avoidance a little different and probably serves to generalize it a lot more than in other mammals i.e. creeping increases in feared content e.g. started with parking garages now includes parking lots.  But honestly you can treat and fix human PTSD to any number of traumasbreaking the avoidance pattern and reprocessing the memoryin largely the same way and you can do the same to any mammals pernicious fear learning in about the same way.  Its simply not a human thing and no though someone always mentions it human intelligence does not lead to PTSDin fact in humans lower intelligence is actually a risk factor.  PTSD is actually pretty simple and extremely wellunderstood.  Thats why its as highly treatable as it is.  Surprised that its highly treatable?  I know.  My students are too every semester.  Honestly easier to fix for good than all of the depressive disorders.Source clinical psychology PhD student work on a national PTSD treatment outcome study teach abnormal psychology at the undergrad level,history,co0blf9,111,t5_2qh53

Do you have any thoughts on this?Also one of the things that Ive heard that relate to your grandfather is that his testimony was extracted with torture and is therefore not a reliable account of what took place at AuschwitzBirkenau. I do not at all believe that his testimony was not answered truthfully to the best of his knowledge however. Have you ever come across this argument and do you have any knowledge about his testimony and trial to help us get a better understanding of what went on? Has anyone in your family tried to convince you that his testimony was forced?Lastly as I recall it was your grandmother who gave away your fathers location to the British while he was in hiding on a farm after the war. Has anyone in your family ever tried to explain to you why your grandfather was so desperate to go into hiding in the first place?,history,cokp4sq,11,t5_2qh53

3130344,0,t3_2vzlys,The English colonies avoided slave labor for thirty or forty years. They used indentured servitude for a generation or so mostly in the tobacco colonies.The Spanish colonies used slave labor because they had a very hard time getting Iberians to migrate to the colonies. The English colonies adopted slavery starting around the s or s in North America because the indentured servants were once freed becoming annoying by asking for good land and English rights. The reason I think slavery happened but was not absolutely needed was the labor shortage. The sugar colonies were brutal to the labor force. Sources Ive encountered put the life span of a sugar worker at less than one year. In the North American colonies it was quite a bit longer because growing tobacco and rice is far less taxing and dangerous than growing and processing sugar. Other cultures grew sugar without the mortality but the Europeans didnt seem to figure that out until the last two hundred years or so. I would argue that Slavery wasnt needed for colonization but it was needed to make some of the colonies economically viable as early as they were. ,history,comghwg,3,t5_2qh53

3320368,0,t3_2y37iu,As others have already mentioned the FrenchAllied forces were not ready to fight the next war.Comparatively German tanks had a bit of a strategic advantage  unlike French tanks German armor carried multiple troops  iirc but dont quote me on that each that performed a certain role within the tank itself. French tanks had only one operator and while the payload they could deliver was to the best of my knowledge quite similar the Germans could fire more quickly by virtue of having several men operating the gun as opposed to just one. They also were lighter required less fuel and could move faster than French tanks.To describe the French resistance as a failure of leadership would be a generous criticism. The French majority leadership was quite unpopular especially Reynaud frequently mocked as renard  the fox.. Moreover from what Ive read on the subject it would seem that the French themselves simply couldnt believe the swiftness with which the Germans traversed France. The French relied on a certain strategy one reliant on the Maginot Line which the French were certain would be the German entry point across the French border  when this failed the French were at a loss as to how to beat the Germans back. While French troops fought valiantly German armor and infantry were better equipped could travel lighter and faster and were generally more prepared for the conflict.

3334265,0,t3_2yc0no,This resource has a solid list of some primary documents regarding the initial U.S. response to reports of a Jewish Holocaust.  Like many others are saying overblown propaganda was an issue but when pushed to verify the information the State Department dragged their feet. They also deliberately tried to keep the reports from the public and denied refugees visas by means of very difficult and extensive processing.This may be due to a number of reasons but accepting responsibility for the refugees would have placed some strain on the War effort and it was feared that this would put the U.S. at a considerable disadvantage. There were also some minor fears about Axis propaganda which had already labeled the U.S. and Roosevelt as friends of the Jewish. By specifically justifying extensive redistribution of troops into central Europe on the basis of rescuing the Jewish victims the U.S. would have played into the Axis propaganda. This could also have disenfranchised other refugees of different nationalities and unfortunately fostered some opposition at home.Other military action may have been feasible but they would have been expensive achieved little and actions such as bombing runs on Auschwitz would have risked the lives of the prisoners.,history,cp8byw4,5,t5_2qh53

Thule is a mythological place like Atlantis which is said to be located in the arcitic Sea. The Members of the Thule Soceity which still exists belive that the People of Thule had to left their Home because it started to get cold and spread south to Europe Persia and India.

3350958,0,t3_2yhq1z,Youre dealing with very very vague terms here.  First and modern are both pretty nebulous.In example what is modern?  Are we using the definition present day or are we using the historical academic definition of the postfeudal period say th century through  or so?  The ACW wasnt the first war for either period.  Id argue that the Thirty Years War was the first major war of the modern historical era and that weve not yet seen a full scale modern as in contemporary war that is one that features fullscale cyber warfare the extensive use of long range precision weapons coordinated media campaigns and so on.A better question to ask might be what made the ACW unique or what firsts were there in the ACW.  The usual answer youd get is something about rifled muskets and trench warfare neither of which is I feel totally accurate.  The biggest factor to me is that it was the first time we saw something approaching total economic mobilization in a modern industrial state.  That coupled with conscription was a major fundamental change in how warfare worked.  Throughout most of recorded history and right up until the th century most wars were decided more or less by one or maybe a couple of decisive battles.  Both sides concentrated their forces as much as possible threw the dice on the table one army wins the battle the other army is broken and that basically decides the outcome of the entire war.In the ACW though the ability of both sides to train equip and move reinforcements fundamentally changed this way of doing business.  Now both sides were able to suffer through what would have been catastrophic defeats in previous generations reorganize reinforce and come back for more a few weeks or a few months later.  Even the South which was really not an industrialized society at that point was able to consistently turn out enough new soldiers to sustain a dozen field armies being attacked by a major industrial power for four years.  This is the major criticism I have for most of the ACW generals aside from Sherman none of them got this.  They all thought that winning THE BIG ONE would be enough.In other words the big takeaway from the ACW and the one that all the European powers missed in the lead up to WWI is that it was REALLY REALLY HARD to break down an industrialized nationstate that has mobilized economically and is determined to resist.  Even winning what once might have been a decisive battle is no longer enough you had to win lots of decisive battles in order to finally win an industrialized war.,history,cpa8fu7,1,t5_2qh53

3503511,0,t3_30bleg,Well the first inhabitants arrived roughly  years ago just after the ice sheets started receding probably from Iberia. I suppose thats the basis of the stock so to speak and there have been other periods of migration which have added to it and altered it. Its my understanding though that the original settler population havent been replaced but the culture and language obviously has. A lot of people see the arrivals of the vikings and then later the Angles Saxons and Jutes as though they effectively replaced the native inhabitants and drove them to the fringes. A genocide almost. But I think thats incorrect more likely the invasions resulted in not that much of an alteration of the population but more so an alteration of the culture and societal structures. The genetic make up of modern Brits actually hasnt changed all that much in the last  years or at least not as much is commonly believed. ,history,cprmiiz,1,t5_2qh53

Whats more those who write history invariably effect how it is presented and ultimately how an individual is viewed.Clearly the general impression of Genghis to the average person is very negative.  He is sometimes used as an example of a treacherous warlord.  No doubt by todays standards hed fail miserably as a positive role model.  But then most leaders in that period would.  Youd have to compare him to his contemporaries and temper your views by the environment in which he lived.IMO given what we know about him Id say he was a very successful leader who made some positive changes for his people but he did this in a largely negative way. ,history,cpwapca,4,t5_2qh53

The American Sherman was a Medium tank that wasnt as powerful but was dependable and easy to produce resulting in many more being fielded even by Russians.I cant speak to infantry weapons.Regarding the infantry itself Id say that at the start of the war the Germans had the most effective infantry.

3590741,0,t3_31hawj,For the American Civil War Id start with Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson. Its probably the best single volume history on the Civil War out there. At over  pages it still only scratches the surface of the war and why it happened. Its a great place to get started though. From there there are literally thousands of books you can read ranging from detailed military and tactical accounts of the major battles biographies foreign policy the navy the role of women and slaves in the war economics etc.Id definitely recommend the series The Years of Lyndon Johnson by Robert Caro. Lyndon Johnson if nothing else was probably the second most important President in the th century behind FDR himself. Caro is also a very good writer. His books are filled with biographical vignettes and anecdotes as well as detailed discussion of elections and legislation. Hitler Nemesis and Hubris two books by Ian Kershaw is an outstanding biography on Hitler.   ,history,cq1klnx,2,t5_2qh53
3595905,0,t1_cq1zicg,You have a source for best close quarters swordsmen? The Samurai werent considered particularly elite and ultimately spears called yari in their time came to outclass swords. So while the katana and a shorter sword may have been the symbol of a samurai they used bows and spears as well as matchlock guns through much of their history and the swords were more a symbol than the feared weapon of the samurai. They had a code yes but they were just as treacherous as most other groups of warriors and are subject to arguably the greatest romanticization of any warrior group in history. Im not saying they were the best swordsmen in history I just would like a source because every historian article writes of them being used as horse archers and spearmen just as much as not more than some sort of elite sword infantry. ,history,cq25rgw,4,t5_2qh53

The problem with this is that they assumed perfect conditions and reversed the engines almost immediately after the turn was given. By this point the ship likely began to fight momentum if even a small amount. The reality is that engine rooms were very noisy places on ships like Titanic and the engineers wouldnt have been expecting any drastic changes in speed or engine direction while in the middle of the voyage. The command was very likely never carried out regardless of what it was.  ,history,cqcxluk,1,t5_2qh53

3800977,1,t1_cqpjhye,There is a popular misconception that people living during Columbus era believed the world was flat.  Quite the contrary not only did people know the world was round but in actuality had some fairly good ideas about its actual size.  Muslim scholars in part seeking a way to determine the correct direction to pray to Mecca developed a form of trigonometry that was used to calculate the Earths dimensions.  More than  years before Columbus set out on his voyages Muslim thinkers had calculated the radius of the Earth within  km of what it actually is.  The West would not learn this for another  years and as a consequence although even Western scholars had managed to accidentally to get the circumference of the Earth right.  Columbus was neither aware of what the Muslim knew nor did he accept what the Ancient Greek thinkers stumbled upon and when he made is proposal to the Crown his proposal didnt even reflect Europes limited scientific knowledge.   If Columbus embodies the values that Westerners believe set them apart from the rest of world what does all of the above say about their perceptions?  What are we to think when we are faced with the reality that Columbus was an ignorant fool by the standards of his day sailing in a ship that was pitiful from an engineering standpoint navigating and conquering using technologies developed by others desperately searching for a way to circumvent the economic and military supremacy of Europes rivals looking to acquire goods Europeans didnt know how to make?Europes rise to power was for lack of a better term a matter of luck.  Europeans were not exceptional in anyway before they discovered the Americas and when they did conquer the Americas their victories were rooted in things beyond their control.  A discussion of the specifics of that is better saved for another post but we can go a few points.  Like how Hernan Cortes abandoned many of the canons at his disposal during his journey and after his defeat in Tenochtitlan or how the Aztec army quickly figured out how canons worked and adapted their tactics accordingly.  Or how gunpowder was rendered largely useless because it couldnt be easily replaced and was ruined in water.  Or how many if not most of the Spaniards abandoned their metal armor in favor of indigenous armor which was lighter and better suited for the climate.   We could talk about the professional army of the Inca Empire no not a European invention.  In fact the Ottomans had a standing army about a century before Columbus even left Europe routed the Spanish several times.  We could talk about how the Spainards would have been enslaved or killed without indigenous rulers showing them mercy.  The most important fact is that the conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires offered Europeans the only and only advantage they had over their Old World competitors a vast and sudden influx of resources and wealth that allowed them to simultaneously destabilize nonEuropean markets while developing their own infrastructure.  All this talk about Europes unique institutions or the Industrial Revolution misses the fact that the groundwork for both was laid using Native American science labor and resources.  If you take those out of the equation none of Europes advances and victories can occur.  That wouldnt be the case of Europeans were exceptionally anything.,history,cqpji1o,-1,t5_2qh53

The difference is in their strategic outlook and eventual legacy.Hannibal lost in the end defeated not by Roman force but by his own strategic and logistical failings.  He miscalculated his ability to do harm to Rome.  His actions angered the Romans and eventually resulted in the complete distruction of Carthage.  Ceterum censeo delenda est Carthago as Cato often said.  Tactical genius but strategic failure.Alexander like Hannibal was tactically sound but logistically and strategically much smarter.  His ability to keep his army supplied in the field was one of his strong points.  But he extended himself too far.  His troops actually rebelled against him when he tried to cross the Ganges and his return march across the desert was a disaster.  Furthermore he completely failed to plan for the future and his empire fragmented as soon as he died.  His constant demands for more men may have weakened Macedonia for generations.Caesars supply lines werent as stretched as the other two but then Caesars campaigns were much less ambitious.  He conquered Gaul but limited his incursions into Germania and Brittania.  His troops were well rewarded with treasure and land and so would later flock to Octavians side.  He proved a competent civilian administrator as well.So if you have to chose between the guy who gets your city destroyed they guy who takes you on a nearly endless march and they guy who lets you go after a few years with cash and land...Caesar wins.,history,cqu5u4x,3,t5_2qh53

They were dropped right on their target zone and completed all of their mission tasks by noon of that day. The map that you have is for a pre D Day jump or perhaps a road march to practice getting to the loading point for a ground unit that would be a part of the landing force. There were THOUSANDS of men camped in various parts of southern England waiting to get the movement order to leave their segregation camps. Segregation meant that they could not leave or send mail or communicate to maintain  operational security. Remember that there were a number of levels of security that applied to paper work and maps. The very top level was for your eyes only  burn after reading. Each Headquarters had a burn bag  for items to be destroyed in a fire. Files with coloured stripes indicated what level of security it had. Persons who had a specific level of security about a specific operation were on a list as being indoctrinated . One list was known as Biggot . They were the top level officers of the Allied Command such as Eisenhower Montgomery and the like. The hand books were Canadian Army ? Each should have a title page and year of issue and a number on the front cover. They would probably be open issue no classification. The Canadian Army had a large number of training books many of which were written by combat experienced Officers and NCOs . This was a way to pass along the hard learned lessons of the front line soldiers to the herbies back in Canada. Herbie is a Canadian Army term for the newly minted private who has a lot to learn in a short period of time. Herbie means well but he can be dangerous when not well supervised especially when on the grenade throwing range...........Dont ask how I know this stuff...GRIN. Herbie can also be counted on to loose every bit of gear that he is issued and get lost inside a  man tent.  Just as the  Corporal is about to shoot Herbie in frustration he finally get something right. And the Corporal thinks.....How can I get him transferred to HQ company ?

I have just never heard of this tactic in my admittedly limited reading on the subject but I do know that the first trench was almost always lightly defended on both sides with the idea being that it would reinforced once battle started.  It just doesnt make sense to me to give up cover and fortified positions and then have to try and take it back in this kind of scenario so Id be interested to read up on it.edit Thanks for all the replies everyone!

The Maratha army was entrenched on one side of a river bank with cannon flanking and aimed down the route that was believed to be the only crossing for miles doing so would have most definitely resulted in a devastating defeat for the British. But despite the arguements of his scouts and his advisers Wellington scouted the river himself and saw two villages on his side of the river. He assured himself that there MUST be a ford in between the villages and the other side of the river and even though his retaining officers said that no such ford existed he ordered his army to cross. Low and behold a ford was there allowing the British to completely circumvente the Maratha forces and forcing them to turn their flank and face the British on their own terms. True military brilliance is something that some men are born with and Arthur Wellesley is one of them. His complete confidence in his actions allowed for a stunning victory that was accomplished mind you when half of his forces were miles away. Years later after Spain and the battle of Waterloo he was asked what his greatest victory was and he said the battle of Assyae. ,history,crfvf9j,6,t5_2qh53

It was passed to defray losses in the Seven Years War but its architect Charles Townsend also hoped that it would tie the colonies closer to the mother country. Why was he or anyone else concerned about the possibility of the American colonies becoming more loosely attached to Great Britain? Because it was seen as an undisputedly bad thing during the time period.I think economic issues were very important to the causes of the American Revolution but youre better off looking at mercantilism and its implications for Britain and its colonies than drawing parallels to modernday austerity. ,history,crhb7px,1,t5_2qh53

Each episode gave a basic running history of how things came to be like Clean Sound Time Cold etc. What was amazing about them was that they showed how these things interconnected with other aspects of history. An example In Glass he explains how in early Italy all the glassmakersblowers were required by law to move to Murano all in one place to lessen the fear of fires due to their proximity to all the towns wooden structures. As a result the glassmakers gained more of a sense of cooperation and discovered things about glass and its manufacture than they otherwise might have known. One of them started importing an odd plant from Pakistanor someplace similar burning it for the ashes which he added to the glass mix producing the worlds first clear glass! They learned to mold halfspheres of glass which could be used as magnifiers for those with poor eyesight.

The water almost certainly meant death I agree.  My statement was meant to note that even with a two hour journey the Californian would have arrived one hour before the Titanic sank.  Thus nearly everyone who would die an hour or so later would have been alive.    While the condition of the ice field is impossible to know I would note that the Californian had made its way into that ice field without sinking or hitting an iceberg.  This was before the Titanic hit a berg placing everyone on notice about just how bad it was.  It seems reasonable to conclude that they could have made a similar trip again at a fairly slow rate of speed given even the limited lighting.  The Californian did not stop until ten pm well after dark showing they were capable of night travel in that exact same field.    The British Inquiry reached the same conclusion I have with all the witnesses and evidence available right after the sinking.  The captain of the Californian nearly got himself into legal trouble over this and the American inquiry encouraged that he face it.

Its like whats the reason you stole the cherry pie because you were hungry or because its delicious. Obviously both are important because I didnt steal onions and eat those.Its not really about one more than its really about the other. Materially it was about slavery and the souths devotion to a horrible means of oppression. And formally it was about the northern states trying to make the federal government violate its constitutionally granted authority.

Some ancient culture were totally cool some not so much. The ancient Roman and Greek cultures didnt think homosexuality was hunky dory it was just much less taboo. The topic of homosexuality in Ancient Greece and Rome is quite a complex one I wouldnt want to imply it was completely acceptable the point is that it was perceived and practiced in a different way before Christianity developed. EDIT here some info about homosexuality in ancient romegtSamesex attitudes and behaviors in ancient Rome often differ markedly from those of the contemporary West. Latin lacks words that would precisely translate homosexual and heterosexual. The primary dichotomy of ancient Roman sexuality was activedominantmasculine and passivesubmissivefeminized. Roman society was patriarchal and the freeborn male citizen possessed political liberty libertas and the right to rule both himself and his household familia. Virtue virtus was seen as an active quality through which a man vir defined himself. The conquest mentality and cult of virility shaped samesex relations. Roman men were free to enjoy sex with other males without a perceived loss of masculinity or social status as long as they took the dominant or penetrative role. Acceptable male partners were slaves prostitutes and entertainers whose lifestyle placed them in the nebulous social realm of infamia excluded from the normal protections accorded a citizen even if they were technically free. Crete Athens Corinth and Thebes practiced classic pederasty. gtA homosocial institute that encouraged love in a myriad of forms between an older man erasts and a youth ermenos. The terms carry certain connotations that directly or indirectly influence modern views on this relationship. The mentor or erasts is intended to be an older man who guides the youth through the upper echelons of society. This was an ancient form of social networking. Erasts means lover. This has been taken to imply a sexual relationship. Especially as ermenos means beloved. These are not so much descriptions of the individuals as titles for their place in the relationship. Its thought not all pederastic relationships were sexual. Although Roman men in general seem to have preferred youths between the ages of  and  as sexual partners freeborn male minors were strictly offlimits and professional prostitutes and entertainers might be considerably older. During the Republic and early Principate little is recorded of sexual relations among women but better and more varied evidence though scattered exists for the later Imperial period. The age of the erastes what wed call the top could vary a lot but they were usually adult men whereas the ermenos bottom was usually from  to early twenties.gt Various ancient sources state that the emperor Nero celebrated two public weddings with men once taking the role of the bride with a freedman Pythagoras and once the groom with Sporus there may have been a third in which he was the bride.The ceremonies included traditional elements such as a dowry and the wearing of the Roman bridal veil. In the early rd century AD the emperor Elagabalus is reported to have been the bride in a wedding to his male partner. Other mature men at his court had husbands or said they had husbands in imitation of the emperor. Although the sources are in general hostile Dio Cassius implies that Neros stage performances were regarded as more scandalous than his marriages to men.,history,csmgnxl,3,t5_2qh53

They actually destroyed several cities founded by the Spaniards in the th century and liberated a good chunk of territory of what today is Chile and Argentina. They accomplished this through a low intensity guerrillalike war that sent Europeans running and forced them to abandon settlements. The Mapuche remained independent and controlled this territory until the th century. Technically they were never conquered by Europeans since they were assimilated into modern Chile not into the Spanish crown. To this day they are pretty independentminded and are actively resisting the forces of globalization by trying to keep some lands out of the hands of transnational logging companies and nonMapuche farmers.

They did have the effect of forcing attackers to come from below to avoid the tail gunner in most cases. one exceptionGoing after a Japanese photorecon late in the war gt Hitting the Nick was not easy. The slipstream prevented Bob from closing with its tail. Reusser pulled up to the Nicks right side. To get above the air compression caused by the Nicks propellers and immediately behind the Nick Bob pulled back to come down on the tail from above. gt Finally aware of the Americans the Nicks rear gunner opened the cover of his cockpit just as Bob was starting his descent. Bullets ripped through the right wing of the Corsair. Undaunted Bob continued his dive and chopped off part of the Nicks rudder with his propeller.gt As Bob climbed for a second strike the rear gunner turned his attention to Reusser. Bob heard Reusser call on the radio The way he is beating on that gun he must think hes going to get it working again. One clip was all the gunner could get off before the altitude also froze his weapon. Unaware of that Reusser later admitted. I was calling to Klingman to hurry up. I wasnt comfortable looking down that gun barrel.gt On his second strike Bobs propeller flung the Japanese machine gun and its gunner into empty sky.  Still the Nick continued level flight. Bobs third strike severed the Nicks tail putting both of their planes into an uncontrolled spin. The Nick broke apart but after falling  feet Bob was able to regain control. ,history,cst5r4n,1,t5_2qh53
4464774,0,t1_cstgdtq,gtFirst define why these are non responsible and give an example of a responsible government.In my post I wrote this responsible government that is a government that represents and owes a duty to the people they govern Examples would actually come out of European Feudalism where the Lords had a duty on paper to protect their peasants and serfs and that the Kings had a duty on paper to protect their vassals. The opposite of this is more traditional forms of government where the emperor or king or lugal or pharo or whatever didnt have to do anything for his subjects. But as part of the theology of ethical monotheism there developed a duty of Feudal Lords to serve their people. This evolved into modern governments serving the public good. Roman Emperors didnt have a duty to serve the public they did or didnt for their own reasons. gtSo polytheism is correct then? Making Monotheism a step backwards.You are using an idea of Forward and backwards in a linear fashion here. The irony here is you are saying absolute ethical rightness is a primitive thing but justifying it with an absolute ethical rightness scale. ,history,cstgnwe,1,t5_2qh53

4467239,0,t1_cstr0xn,Dont delude yourself or youre doing the same thing as the people claiming slavery wasnt the main issue of the civil war. Lincoln was not a saint and there were northern and southern racists. America was not some united front against slavery and Lincoln himself said that he was concerned with saving the Union by whatever means necessary.  gt On Aug.   President Lincoln wrote a letter to the New York Tribune that included the following passage If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race I do because I believe it helps to save the Union and what I forbear I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.That doesnt mean what Lincoln did wasnt amazing or that the North didnt fight the good fight to abolish slavery. Both of those statements are true. But we shouldnt perpetuate simplistic fantasies about the past either. Youre implying that America as a whole said no to slavery by voting in Lincoln. I dont think any historian would in good conscience agree with your portrayal of history. I think Jake Flanagin put it well in a recent article on the subject when he said we should refrain from obscuring Civil War history in hollow romancegt Ultimately the debate over motives for Southern secession trivializes the true shame of antebellum America the existence of an institution of slavery all together. Which is why the effort to debunk Civil War myths must avoid becoming an exercise in elevating the morality of white Northerners. That too is beside the point. As history inarguably demonstrates life for free African Americans in the postbellum North was subject to just as many miseries and injustices as in the South. And although one region outpaced the other in the formal abolition of slavery neither was immune to the informal perpetuation of inequities established by slavetrade. ,history,cstrs9r,2,t5_2qh53

No. It was over states rights.And a responsegtHistorians acknowledge that disagreements over states rights played a role in the Civil War. But the states rights issue was inseparable from slavery they say The right that states in the South were seeking to protect after all was the right to buy and sell people. Southern states made that clear in their declarations of independence from the union said James Grossman the executive director of the American Historical Association.

4744308,0,t3_3fvjs1,US citizen here and the general belief among many teachers and students is that dropping those two bombs forced a surrender from the Japanese and saved quite a few lives on both sides by making an invasion unnecessary. This may or may not be correct. Though judging from the Japanese defense plans for the main island it is likely they could have inflicted an extreme number of casualties before the allies even established a beachhead as they had a good idea of where an amphibious landing was likely to happen. I remember several debates in both high school and college revolving around whether or not the nukes actually shocked the Japanese government into surrender or if it was just coincidence that the hard line elements in the military had finally been beaten down by civilian leadership within the Japanese government that knew the war was lost for quite some time. Dan Carlin has a very good oneoff hardcore history episode on this topic called Logical Insanity. It focuses on the atmosphere of ideas and theories of warfarepsychology that allowed the strategic bombing campaigns of WWII to become reality. It is a great listen. The same topic has also been covered by many others. From what I can glean a general consensus now exists that strategic bombing campaigns including nuking Japan were flawed in that they do not do a lot to dampen an opponents ability to wage war contrary to the reasons such campaigns are undertaken.,history,ctskcfb,1,t5_2qh53

So once we got to the World War  unit and more specifically the ending of WWII we didnt define whether or not the bombing was a good idea or a bad. Some people had different ideas than others. It was concluded that it was extreme but wed go on constant debates of whether the atomic bomb killed more or saved more. Obviously it saved more american lives which was the main goal for the Americans at the time I suppose however it decimated Hiroshima as well as Nagasaki and it raises the question of whether or not the bomb saved more lives than what would have taken its place a full scale invasion of Japan.

4775209,1,t3_3g9ph7,The Royal Navy must have been absolutely desperate to sink the Bismark. In my opinion having the Hood engage the German pocket Battleship was almost criminal negligence. Granted the Hood was probably the most famous British ship of the time but she was a Heavy Cruiser and never meant to take a Battleship on. Her job was to find and shadow until proper force could be brought to bare. On top of that she was still undergoing renovations had no deck armor amidships and actually had civilian ship workers still on her. The British Admiralty is solely responsible for her loss. You think they would have learned their lesson from Cruiser lossses im WW.   ,history,ctwghhq,1,t5_2qh53

Ie the inquisition as the religious arm of the monarchy. Excellent examples are the way the spanish inquisition handled disagreements between the pope and the spanish monarchs The Spanish Monarchs trumfed or ignored the pope and the pope was then forced to agree to the given policy.Furthermore many refugees by the persecution of the Spanish Inquisition fled to Rome  and found asylum! It seems to be a bit weird to seek help from the supposed head of the inquisition hunting you  unless the pope was actually not in charge!It has been some years since I went through the literature on the field but there seem to be a revisionist trend going.

4972201,0,t1_cul3wej,As subito said the Romans had great respect for the courage of the Germansor Germanians really and were defeated a couple of times sometimes harshly but thats to be expected. The different peoples that inhabited Germania Anglia and even further north and northeast had a history of warfare against the Roman Empire stretching from at least  b.c. to the time of the Empires downfall. Thats  years of warfare. No Empire is going to have an unbroken record in such a span of time. The fact is that even when the Roman Empire was at its weakest its soldiers emperor and greatest generals not even Roman that the Empire still achieved some amazing victories making sure the border on the Rhine stayed secure for a very long time against very very great odds. The fact that they didnt expand northward was because there was nothing there except for an enormous continuous forest with tribesmen hiding behind every tree. Atleast thats how it felt to the Roman legions. Germanicus under Emperor Tiberius actually penetrated into Germania and just turned back because the Rhine was the perfect frontier. The Roman Empire just wanted to keep the tribes who were greedy for good farmland out of the Empire. As long as they stayed in their own scary forest it was all good. The tribes from Germania stayed dumbin the way of warfare all the way to the downfall of the Empire. The most dangerous German tribe were actually the Goths who became so strong only after coming into contact with other cultures and observing a mostly unchanging Rome for a long time. The most effective fighters against the Roman Empire were the Parthians or more properly their successors the Sassanids. ,history,cula6xx,6,t5_2qh53

In fact the first permanent British income tax was not introduced until  and the issue remained intensely controversial well into the th century.gt gt When the window tax was introduced it consisted of two parts a flatrate house tax of  shillings per house equivalent to . in  and a variable tax for the number of windows above ten windows in the house. Properties with between ten and twenty windows paid a total of four shillings . in   and those above twenty windows paid eight shillings . in . The number of windows that incurred tax was changed to seven in  and eight in .gt gt The flatrate tax was changed to a variable rate dependent on the property value in . People who were exempt from paying church or poor rates for reasons of poverty were exempt from the window tax. Window tax was relatively unintrusive and easy to assess. Certain rooms particularly dairies cheeserooms and milkhouses were exempt providing they were clearly labelled and it is not uncommon to find the name of such rooms carved on the lintel. The bigger the house the more windows it was likely to have and the more tax the occupants would pay. Nevertheless the tax was unpopular because it was seen by some as a tax on light and air.gt gt gt Blockedup windows in Edinburghgt In Scotland a window tax was imposed after . A house had to have at least seven windows or a rent of at least  to be taxed.gt gt A similar tax existed in France from  to  Impt sur les portes et fentres.Frenchgt gt There was a strong agitation in England in favour of the abolition of the tax during the winter of  and it was accordingly repealed on  July  and a tax on inhabited houses substituted.

5112189,0,t1_cv25fde,Taking historic artistic works at face value can be... problematic. Lets look at Greece for example. Around  BC they were producing pottery that portrayed people as almost exclusively black. If you were to take this at face value you might think the Greeks look something like subSaharan Africans. Fast forward about a hundred years and we see a shift to red figure pottery. If you took this at face value you might think the Greeks were alabasterskinned and looked not terribly unlike the Scandinavians. This is a particularly good example because we know the Greeks almost certainly looked nothing like either of these art styles portray theyre better described as oliveskinned. That using the Fitzpatrick scale would put them two steps away from the depiction in black figure pottery and three steps away from the depiction in red figure pottery. I seriously doubt the Egyptians were purely one color or the other. Egypt was always something of a melting pot. At various times it was ruled by rather distinct ethnicities. Its situated at the logical crossing point between Africa and Asia. Ancient Egyptian apparently draws most heavily from Semitic languages but also has strong East African influences.If you could use a time machine and travel back to Ancient Egypt Id expect you to find a people that look pretty similar to modern Arabs. Or perhaps the kind of skin tone you see in Sicily  the one that probably originated from a combination of Arab rule and the general olive skin tone that permeates much of the Mediterranean coast. Especially when you get to the Ptolemaic dynasty and Egypts much closer interaction with the Hellenistic world than the subSaharan world. But honestly? It doesnt fucking matter. The dispute is largely over which nationalist group gets to claim Ancient Egypt as their people. ,history,cv27klk,28,t5_2qh53

Grenades Rifle Grenades and Mortars were utilized with the Germans once again acknowledging an advantage for the British in the form of the  inch Stokes Mortar which essentially set the standard for future mortar designs stovepipe baseplate and tripod? Literally hasnt changed since. Gas was used in major attacks and by the end of the war was being used extensively to neutralize targets like artillery and deny areas to the enemy the British Livens Projector was a potent delivery weapon. The Tank of course made its dbut at FlersCourcelettes in September and although their performance overall was mixed they did demonstrate their ability to support infantry on numerous occasions most notably at the Schwaben Redoubt.Firepower and Airpower were key components of the battle. Although German Albatros Biplanes made their dbut towards October  they were unable to substantially overturn FrancoBritish air superiority which had been exerted over the battlefield since June. German movements could be tracked supply lines could be bombed and strafed as could positions movement during the day was harassed and morale overall was deeply shaken by the impotence of the Luftstreitkrafte Oswald Boelckes death probably didnt help. Above all air superiority allowed the FrancoBritish armies to summon deadly accurate artillery support drowning out their German counterparts. Dugouts and deep bunkers began to be avoided as a cave in could trap whole platoons and sections. That the FrancoBritish armies French th amp th British th amp Reserveth possessed by September sufficient artillery to bring the German second and third positions under fire almost together meant that not even the rear areas were safe hot food water replacements and ammo had to be husbanded carefully.

5131356,0,t3_3l74kt,Dress historian and historical interpreter here. Oh hell costume touches everything so lets just call me a historian.First people did bath just not in a way youd recognize. They bathed daily sometimes multiple times a day using a wetted rag and various soaps acids pleasant waters etc much like what my Oklahoma grandma called spitbaths  you clean your face and neck your armpits and then your genitals. A second cloth wipes anything off the rest of your torso and limbs but generally those are covered by your garments. I still do this when camping and when working at reenactment events. Your body linen aka your shirtshiftchemisesmock the layer that goes closest to your body absorbs most of the oil dirt and grease from your skin. You change and launder that shirt as often as you can afford to and it keeps the body smells from getting into your clothing. Rich people had like a months supply of fresh shirts extremely poor people might have to wrap up in a blanket and hide while they were washing their single smock. This bodylinen layer continues up until about the s.People didnt do fullimmersion bathing more than three or four times a year unless they were seriously eccentric because the water was absolutely filthy and the cost and labor of heating it was prohibitive. This was particularly with the increasing urbanization of populations the utter lack of sewerage systems and everyones lack of understanding of germs and pathogens. People during this era mostly drank small beer low alcohol content and other fermented beverages rather than water because the production process required boiling which killed most pathogens and the small amount of alcohol was enough to help keep things sterile. It was also a great source of vitamins but thats a talk for another day...When you see paintings of people using bidets you have to think of a few things before you ascribe this to the entire population.  They were painting this to titillate. Paintings of women because to be honest I havent yet seen a picture of a man using a bidet are pretty universally a private cabinet subject meaning basically some old dude with money has paid someone to paint a picture of a woman showing her bits for his spankbank. Bidets were by no means universal.  Bidets and bourdalous were for use while dressed for the middle and upper classes as a convenience.  Up until about the early s most womens underwear had no crotch seam because the number of undergarments youd have to shed to get to the restroom would mean you get completely undressed each time and sometimes thats a  to  minute process. Its even longer for court gowns and superformal ensembles. When you only have to squat over a bowl things are much quicker and honestly cleaner. Ever wear a long coat into a public toilet? Youre implying that they used targeted bathing and never got undressed which is absolutely false.Makeup was also part of a formal ensemble or toilette for court people but it was generally seen as a sign of poor morals outside of court. Yes they washed or wiped the makeup off to go to bed because otherwise youd have to launder your bedclothes more often and thats also expensive. Yes there were syphilis sores which bled and suppurated and stank and yes the makeup would cover it. In the th century you also see the addition of velvet patches used to decorative effect to cover them but since youre talking about the s thats outside the time youre considering. And yes they used scents to cover up odors  but you have to consider this in the context that first it was a MUCH smellier world than we currently live in so scent was as much for your own comfort as for the comfort of others and second that scents were expensive and so to wear them in the first place was a very conspicuous consumption.So to answer your question no. I do not think that your conclusion that shame and disgust for the body was caused by syphilis is a good one.,history,cv4iqj6,44,t5_2qh53

But the third game has them listed as an entire enemy class meaning there are numerous kinds. Everything from lesser vampires which are basically mansized bipedal vampire bats to higher vampires which are the typical immortal vampire. The lesser vampires are a pretty big threat  Aside from their forearmlength claws they can also do things like turn invisible and heal rapidly. However the game mentions that the high vampires dont actually need blood and many treat it like a delicacy or abstain completely. Most are content with settling down in a nice village and basically pretending to be human.It also mentions that the high vampires arent weak to many of the things that are commonly believed  They dont have an aversion to holy symbols they can walk around in sunlight and they dont sleep in caskets.

I dont think its really about the moon at all otherwise it wouldnt be such a universal phenomenom across almost all cultures. More likely than not it was adapted because the lunar cycle is roughly the same length as the human reproductive cycle and they realized it fit well enough to track periods with it.

He was something of a slave for the ottomans he returned to his country where he became the ruler he helped his cousin or something Stefan the Great to take the throne of Moldavia he battled the ottomans.

5179992,0,t1_cva9938,Just to dispell a common myth the muzzle loading muskets of the civil war were actually extremely extremely accurate. Enough so up to  yards. They used a minie ball design which was a conical bullet with three rings on the side. The bottom of the minie ball had a hollow cavern on the bottom which when fired would expandflare out evenly causing the  rings on the bullet to engage the rifling in the barrel in addition because the bullet would effectively seal in the gasses and pressure from the exploding powder they could use more propellant increasing the velocity of the bullet. The result was an extremely accurate rifle when fired properly. Only inexperenced troops were inaccurate with these rifles. The common caliber of rifles then was . so it was an extremely heavy round which caused significant bullet drop. the sights on the Springfield were manufactured to counter this but most northern troops had no clue how to properly use them because for the most part they had never fired a gun before. Hence why southern troops had a significant advantage in the begining of the war.. they used guns frequently in the south and were awfully accurate with them. Personally I wouldve never gone up against Stonewalls troops. Those dudes were unreal. Sources Im a super dork when it comes to the civil war.

Youre right in all your points OP but its important to remember that repeaters have their own place as an rapidfire closerange weapon.

Though there are two branches White and Blue Nile and the White Nile connects all the way to Lake Victoria so theoretically thats as far south as I would say people could or would go. Road building was not all that common in the ancient world it was much easier to travel by water. Cataracts waterfallsrapids were huge barriers to southbound travel on the Nile though the kingdoms of Egypt usually drew their borders ending right at the cataracts. The farthest they got was the th cataract in Sudan which is still pretty damn far south of where most people think when they think of Ancient Egypt in the Nile Delta.I believe Arabs in the middle ages sailed down the coast as far south as Mozambique so its possible they may have traded or interacted with people from todays South Africa.

So the Egyptians had a problem. For a portion of the year they had tons of farmers doing nothing. So instead of doing nothing and getting into trouble they were employed working on the great structures. Was it pleasant work? Not necessarily but Im unsure of the specifics of how the workers were treated. It was less forced labor and more a method of paying your dues to society. Was it much better than slavery? In terms of social status yes. Workers may have been peasants but they were not slaves.Now Egypt of course did have slaves. However slaves were unworthy to work on such important things as the pharaohs tomb.

5321128,0,t1_cvrn5bi,gt I take your point but I feel youre really engaging in semantics.No Im countering a false summary with a truthful explanation. You are engaging in semantics trying to broaden the meaning of the word provide. I didnt think the story needed sexing up as it was but apparently you do.gt Assuming youre correctYou had just conceded that I am unless Im mistaken.gt its fair to say that the West facilitated Saddam in obtaining mustard gasYes.gt and that it is very likely that if he would not have been able to otherwise obtain it.No. Keep in mind that it was first used in combat  years before Halabja. Mustard gas was not cutting edge technology as far as chemical weapons go and there was no shortage of countries that could help you make the stuff. Egypt used it in North Yemen in the s and I havent found any information on Western assistance to its program. Im pretty sure Syria manufactured mustard gas without it. Iraqs foreign assistance wasnt even entirely Western countries like Egypt them again and India one of Iraqs closest partners helped greatly. The West was never the only game in town.gt Also the US knew he was using it too  and did nothing to stop it.What US action meant to prevent Iraqi use of chemical weapons in general and mustard gas in particular would you have approved of?gt I think we can understand however why one might have been inclined not to end it there. Saddam had invaded Iran not the other way round.Am I supposed to understand it or am I supposed to approve of it? Because this empathy business can cut any way you want it to cut. When it came to Iraqi chemical weapons you were quite unsparing and had no trouble conflating international assistance from a number of countries some of them Western into the west ... providing the gas. Yet when it comes to Khomeini quadrupling the length of that war for a goal that he was warned in  would be extremely difficult to accomplish youre full of understanding. How easily you switch from one set of criteria to another.gt Your assertion that this played a significant role in why the West had little sympathy for Iran is rather odd.Actually I didnt say anything about the West I mentioned international sympathy. Iran didnt have it because it was Tehran that refused to make peace for the last  years of the war and because Baghdad had friends on every side of the Iron Curtain and throughout the Arab world. But you clearly think everythings about the West.gt I would suggest that what played a significant role was the overthrow of the Shah and the US Embassy incident.Nope. The only country affected by the incident again youre underselling something that puts Iran in a bad light was the United States. Nobody else cared enough to let it affect their regional policy. As for the Shah not even the US was influenced by his overthrow. The Shah was just a man and by the time the war started not even a live one. Iran is a country a very important one. Iran matters whoever is in charge of it only matters while theyre in charge of it. Resentment just like liking and disliking countries is for sentimental idiots. The overthrow of the Shah meant that most of Imperial Irans allies were going to try to maintain their relations with Islamic Iran and most of its adversaries were going to try to draw it to their side. Israel succeeded in doing precisely that and became a de facto Iranian ally during the war not that Khomeini or his successors ever admitted it. Washingtons policy after the Islamic Revolution was to maintain its previous influence with Iran and combat Soviet interest in the new regime. It was up to Khomeini how this reset would go. The hostage crisis is just one paragraph in the complicated story of how he screwed it up.Those Western countries that did not have a dog in the fight as the US France and Britain did were more than happy to sell weapons to both sides. Its precisely because the West did not present a unified front that Iran was able to conduct the war for  years. It took intense pressure from the United States Operation Staunch to prevent USmade weapons making their way from their Western and nonWestern buyers to Iran. And then the US undercut its own policy by selling missiles to Iran.gt That coupled with the Irans attempts to nationalize its oil industry and the overthrow of Mossadeeq a democratically elected leader were far more significant.Mosaddeghs overthrow had nothing to do with how anyone reacted to the IranIraq War except in the Iranian retelling of the conflict where it was the defining event of the th century. Iranians and foreign sympathizers of the Islamic Republic never tire of both schooling people on this subject and assuming everyones opinions about and attitudes towards the regime are informed by it.Heres an idea Maybe just maybe those countries that sided with Iraq a group which is not identical but has some overlap with the West did so because it was in their national interest to do so. And maybe Ruhollah IwanttodestabilizemyneigbhorsandIhatebothsuperpowersandIdontcarewhoknowsit Khomeini deserves some of the credit for that.Oh and Iraq had nationalized its oil industry between  and . It was a founding member of OPEC. As was Iran under the Shah.gt The West did not like IranInternational relations are not an elementary school playground and Western countries are not a hive mind.gt and were actively supporting Iraq and Saddam in trying to destroy it.So when Khomeini was refusing to make peace because he was trying to overthrow Saddam was he trying to destroy Iran?gt My general point on the article was that it was written with rose tinted glasses ignoring how complicit the West was with Saddam in particular the US and British. That kind of revisionism has little place in civilized modern discourse and certainly no place on a reputable news source like the BBC. I would understand your comment to mean that you largely agree with the articles POV and the idea that Iran were as much to blame for the war as Iraq.No the articles just BS because it offers a selective history to the degree it even bothers with one. It doesnt even have a POV for me to share which also means it cant qualify as revisionism. Its onlythestuffthatsmostwidelyknown mixed in with onlybringingupthepastsoyoucandiscussthepresent. Its like a history of the Rolling Stones that only mentions  or  hits that everybody knows and spends half its time talking about more famous modernday bands that were supposedly influenced by them. The United States is the only supporter of Iraq thats mentioned in case you didnt notice. The end result is that it plays into the proIranian narrative more than it otherwise would though nowhere near enough for you. I dont think thats by design its just a combination of biases so predictable theyre boring one of which is Westerncentrism which you clearly share.,history,cvru4bp,2,t5_2qh53

He warned his fellow TexansLet me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives you may win Southern independence if God be not against you but I doubt it. I tell you that while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery impulsive people as you are for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche and what I fear is they will overwhelm the South.In response to Houstons sage advice his fellow Texans removed him from office for refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy.Houston retired to Huntsville TX where his health rapidly declined.

Based on their analysis BBNs engineers determined that there was more than one shooter in Dealey meaning that a conspiracy was afoot. However subsequent analysis by the National Academy of Sciences roundly debunked BBNs initial findings.The acoustic analyses do not demonstrate that there was a grassy knoll shot and in particular there is no acoustic basis for the claim of  probability of such a shot.The acoustic impulses attributed to gunshots were recorded about one minute after the President had been shot and the motorcade had been instructed to go to the hospital.Therefore reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman.,history,cw6r166,0,t5_2qh53

5447630,0,t1_cw7r9cf,We then run into another issue. The time separation between the Hittites as either a ethnicity or a state and the Kurds respectively is almost  years. The Hittites as a people moved from the Caucasus into Anatolia c. BC founded the Hittite state in about  BC under Pithan and then Anitta collapsed under a variety of external and internal pressures by  BC and then migrated gradually into northern Syria to form the NeoHittite states which slowly lost the Hittite cultural identity under the rule of various empires and ethnic influxThe modern Kurds are first recorded in the th century AD by both Arabic and Persian sources but as primarily a socioeconomic group and less as a unique dialect of IndoIranian. Now mention of the word Kurd goes back to the Sassanid empire as a collection of west Iranian tribes in the northern Tigris region. It wasnt until about the middle ages you saw anything approaching a Kurdish kingdom or state. That means at a minimum at least  years exist between the Hittites completely disappearing as a people and the Kurds being even given cursory mention in textual sources. To give a total summary the Kurds wereare a Western Iranian ethnic group speaking a language related at its roots to Parthian and by extension Medean. They live in and around the Northern Tigris region in Syria Turkey Iran and Iraq. A rough time frame for their existence is about c.  ADat the very earliest to Present.The Hittites were a Anatolian ethnic group that spoke a Anatolian IndoEuropean language as part of that highly archaic and distinct branch of IndoEuropean. They lived first in the Armenian highlands and then central Anatolia as the Hittite empire. They then scattered to every part of Anatolia with a large population settling in Northwestern Syria with a geographic center around Malayta province Turkey. From after  BC the Hittite aspect was eventually totally subsumed by Aramaic peoples. A rough time frame for their existence as a distinct ethnolingustic group is c.  BC at the earliest to  BC at the very latest. So only at the genetic level could the Kurds and Hittites be related and this is only because the Hittites formed a component of the basic genetic mix of Northern Syria which the Kurds eventually came out ofafter migrating with the rest of the Iranian peoples Mitanni substrate being a exception. They are linguistically unrelated artistically unrelated culturally unrelated and historically unrelated beyond the most basic of linkages.Its a appealing thought I imagine but I cant see any real evidence behind it.EDIT made some minor fixes,history,cw7zk1w,3,t5_2qh53

5468890,0,t1_cwai4ao,Edit this is a fantastic essay about a successful young academics decision to leave the academy. Out of the countless why Im leaving the academy why you should not enter the academy andor whats wrong with the university system essays youll find online this one is in my view by far the best.Apostate classicist here. Unless you cant imagine doing anything else with your life edit by which I mean that you love classics so much that there is nothing else you want to do not that you dont have any other ideas as far as what to do with yourself and you really truly love the secondary literature thats currently being written and you read it in your spare time and crave nothing more than to write it yourself you should not go to grad school in classics or in history as an ancient historian. If your Latin and Greek arent stellar dont even think about it. Or dont think about it until youve gone to Penns Postbacc and a masters program.I dont think you can understand how shitty the job market is until youve seen a few searches and applied for jobs yourself. The last time the department where I did my PhD ran a search for a TT post they received  applications. For one job. One. A friend of mine currently has a fancy postdoc in historymultidisciplinary humanities at an ultrafancy school. She beat out  other applicants and yet her prospects for TT employment are grim. Last time we spoke she was strongly considering leaving the field.The numbers obviously are dreadful. But thats only part of the miserable story of the academic job market. Added to those abysmal lottery odds are a few other fun facts that add up to this it doesnt matter how good you are or how hard you work because the criteria that determine whether you get a job have nothing to do with you your qualities as a person or the quality of your work. The criteria are almost  arbitrary If theres a typo in your cover letter or you didnt say exactly the right thing to the search committee during your interview  too bad youre cut. Theyre working through so many applications and applicants and are so exhausted that theyll desperately latch onto any  ANY  flaw on your part that will help them shrink the pool. That includes perceived flaws that arent actually flaws. If your work isnt exactly the kind of work theyre looking for or youre doing it in a way that isnt exactly the way they think you should be doing it  or it doesnt interest them as much as some other guys way of doing it  youre fucked. Remember those  people who didnt get the job at my school? Many of them were in direct competition with one another in exactly this sort of way. The outcomes of most of those miniature competitions were of course irrelevant since most of those peopel werent even considered. Those who were in competition with the candidate who got the job merely made the mistake that they happened not to be doing exactly the kind of work my department decided it wanted. There was nothing they could have done in the past to rectify that mistake because studying what they studied wasnt for the most part actually a mistake. They just werent doing the kind of work that the person who got the job was doing  or not doing it as well in the eyes of the search committee who have their own arbitrary preferences and axes to grind or selling it as well edit to the particular audience that that search committee comprised. If some batshit fucking crazy old guy on the committee doesnt like the color of your shoes the tone of your voice the cut of your jib too bad. Once again you are probably fucked. Hm no thats not the right way of making this point. Imagine that you applied to a departmetn that has a particular social or intellectual dynamic. Maybe theyre broclassicists hipsters or Continental intellectuals. Maybe you dont fit into that or complement it  or you dont fit into it as well as another candidate. Theres a good chance the search committee will thank you for your excellent application and wish you all the best in what they are sure will be a fruitful exciting career. Given the amount of time they expect to spend with you as a colleague why on earth would they hire you over the person they think they connect with better  especially when there are other candidates whose qualifications are either the same as yours or better? Lately there has been a strong push  which I support  to bring underrepresented minorities into the field. Id laugh in the face of anybody who tried to tell me that white men are at a disadvantage but its a factor that is completely out of your control and can easily get you disqualified from consideration for a position for which you are otherwise perfectly qualified. But being a woman or underrepresented minority wont necessarily help you because these efforts to bring people like you into the field are more than counterbalanced by persisting breathtaking racism and sexism at the structural and individual level.Even if youre not fucked by all of the above youre still probably fucked because theres a good chance that  especially if its a job worth having and especially especially if the job ad seems to be written for someone just like you what luck!  theres an inside candidate. All those hours you spent on your writing sample on the letter of application preparing for the interview? Yeah those were almost certainly wasted. Sorry! We thank you for your application wish you all the best and look forward to seeing you at future meetings.If youre lucky maybe youll end up like my friend who went to a topshelf program top Ivy and now gets to be an adjunct teaching courses in an expensive major US city for classsemester. He could lose his contract at any time has no health insurance and needs another job to make ends meet but hey at least hes still in the field. God bless those resilient scrappy young people amirite?Im still technically in the field but I cant wait to get the fuck out.The job market in law is also dreadful by the way. And nearly every law student I got to know when I was doing my PhD is leaving. I wasnt hanging around the ultraambitious careerist douches of whom Im sure many are staying in the field. But if you have any depth the odds are good that youll find a legal career a grim fate. The people I know in law who are happy there are people who went into it because of their passion for specific issues.As far as entering academia I dont know the legal field nearly as well as I know my own but its my understanding that becoming a professor of law is even more difficult than becoming a professor of classics.If youre so insanely brilliant edit and focused that none of the above matters great! Go for it! If youre not keep in mind that unless you somehow manage to claw your way to the top of your field and get preposterously lucky the prospects are not good. In fact theyre awful.And if you do decide to go dont be afraid to take time off. The most successful students are not the ones who rush off to school. Grad school rewards maturity and focus. If you cant think of what else youd do with yourself other than law school or classics then Id strongly advise doing neither for a while before settling on one. Your decision when you finally make it will be much better informed youll be more certain about it and in all likelihood your outcome will be better.Edit one final thought. Saying that the job market is bananas isnt the same thing as saying the field itself is rotten.Edit If you apply to PhD programs in the humanities but dont get into one of the best move on with your life. Do something else. Nontop programs wont pay you nearly enough theyll probably assign you an unreasonable or unmanageable teaching load  and your academic job prospects will be even worse than what Ive described here.Edit uthrasumachos boldly points out that its fairly easy to get Latin teaching jobs. Thats true. But teaching high school is no walk in the park. I turned down a few private schools because the money was so preposterously bad. Fun littleknown fact public schools pay better  both in dollar terms and in terms of benefits  than most private schools. If you want to teach high school go for it. The world needs you. But we could have a whole other long discussion about various crises in secondary education and the difficulty of retaining capable motivated young teachers.,history,cwapaoo,67,t5_2qh53

Crude iron is pretty hard and inflexible if quenched dipped in water when hot. For a good stone chisel you dont want a razors edge. A wood chisel should cut you if you put your finger on it but a masonry chisel edge is more blunt. You are not really cutting the stone you are transferring a shock to the edge that fractures the stone. With a wood chisel you really do want it to cut the wood.Yes flexibility of the blade toughness and high modulus of elasticity is what is needed to make a blade lightweight and not likely to break. Those are properties of steel.Layers of steel and iron were used as you mention to give just the right mixture of desirable properties such as the production of Damascus steel.,history,cwkg6di,1,t5_2qh53

Here are a couple that you may not be familiar with..... Fishbowl Hydra and Bigot. How about the  Double X committee ?  The Dieppe raid was originally known as Rutter and after it was rescheduled  as Jubilee. To mount it a second time after all the original troops had been allowed to go on leave and talk about it all over Britain was insanity. But of course the man in charge Ian Fleming cared more about stealing a ENIGMA machine than the loss of thousands of Canadian soldiers lives. THAT was the real reason for the Dieppe raid to allow a RM commando platoon to get in to the German Naval HQ in Dieppe and snatch the new four rotor machine and the associated code books. Unfortunately that RM party never got to shore so the machine was not acquired. Not at the that time  anyways.Ian Fleming never admitted that the ENIGMA snatch  was the real reason for Dieppe.

5648993,0,t1_cwxaaa1,Please.Blackfacedwhiteguy Othello is inexcusable for a number of reasons none of which are indicative of hypocrisy. The first is that Shakespeare has exactly two major characters of African origin Othello and Aaron. Current consensus is that he wrote  plays. Pulling numbers from a hat Ill figure five major characters per play. Thats  roles for white actors to two for nonwhite actors. Its a much bigger deal to cast Othello the one and only darkskinned protagonist of a Shakespeare play with a white actor than it is to use actors of color for characters typically cast as European. Thats just pragmatism. Then we should consider that Shakespeare doesnt write a lot of characters who are explicitly white. For one thing theres no such racial category in his day. For another his various European settings imply but dont guarantee white characters so no racial designations tended to be used. That means that while Othello is labeled a Moor Mercutio for example has no racial label. Baz Luhrmann casting Harold Perrineau isnt even a raceswap. If there are Moorish captains in Venice there may well be darkskinned Montague retainers in Verona. With a wealth of talented actors of color in the world theres no reason Mercutio cant be black.Third reason is just history. In America at least the practice of blackface in theatre is linked tightly to minstrelsy a hugely popular form of theatrical racist caricature. While Olivier in blackface isnt a caricature of Othello the optics to use a newer term arent good. White guys blacking up cant help but evoke the explicitly racist history of minstrel shows. Why should we condone that practice when you can give the role to Laurence Fishburne Clarke Peters Idris Elba or Chiwetel Ejiofor? All of them have played it and killed it.,history,cwxb9ap,11,t5_2qh53

As a structuralist he basically argues that the nationalsocialist movement was succesfull because it wasnt that far away form mainstream conservatism and popular convictions antisemitism militarism authoritarianism and so on. In other words the fit quite good into german Zeitgeist. Everything existed without Hitler and just when the crisis kicked in the NSDAP was able to get popular support on a massive scale and exploit the situation. Something they did well. Nevertheless Hitlers chancellorship just happend because the conservative elites thought they would be able to control and use him. As in Italy power wasnt conquered but handed over.,history,cx4z851,1,t5_2qh53

It is thoroughly rebutted here   Your argument was that Nagumo should have launched a third strike to hit the port and oil facilities in order to deny Pearl Harbor as a base of operations but he chose not to.  As I quotegtPerhaps the decision by Adm. Nagumo to not launch a third strike vs. Pearl Harbor and hit the repair and oil storage facilities there  it would have denied the US a very important strategic base for the subsequent operations into the Marshalls Marianas and Philippines possibly delaying the end of the war by years. The rd strike was urged by Capt. Genda but Nagumo turned him down.My argument was that not only would a third strike not have targeted the facilities due to Japanese planning which prioritized the shipping well above that of those facilities but that there was no urging by Genda to make a third strike or anybody period!  Even assuming Fuchida was telling the truth which he has been thoroughly demonstrated to have been not it is indisputable that Genda advised against a third strike such as in this text  The only place where Genda actually is seen asking for a third strike is in the fictional film Tora!

The secret protocols he agreed to in the MolotovRibbentrop Pact before the Winter War stated specifically that Stalin would have access to the Baltic regions so Hitler was well aware of Soviet intentions concerning Finland. Stalin wasnt afraid of the Finns at all the Soviets had established COMINT posts in the Gulf of Finland and saw protecting the Gulf as a way to protect the Soviet Union from a potential future attack made by Germany. Finland was just in the way and proved difficult to deal with. So basically in this recording Hitler is politicking to appease Mannerheim and nothing more.

5854778,0,t3_3vdvi3,We cannot draw conclusions on this question based on the propaganda at the time.  Obviously all printed material talked of guaranteed victory. In short yes there was fear that we would not be able to win.  This was primarily in the first months of  between Pearl Harbor and Midway.  Germany was on the verge of victory in Europe and Japan had a much larger and better experienced Navy.  Japan was also expanding.  A study done at that time concluded that if Japan launched a fullscale  invasion of California they would make it to Chicago before we stopped them.  There was a very real fear that Hawaii would be invaded.  It was almost expected.  This would have significantly hampered our ability to operate a Pacific Navy.    It was also concluded that if Russia collapsed dislodging Germany from the occupied states would be prohibitively difficult.  And Russia was in early  on the verge of collapse. Thus yes there was a fear that we would not win.  Perhaps not a fear of absolute defeat but a very real fear that we could not achieve our objectives and that Japan and Germany would win by getting what they wanted.  ,history,cxn38rg,4,t5_2qh53

5882781,0,t3_3vtuwz,Willmotts Pearl Harbor explicitly denotes the following as the target priority of the Japanese strikeAirfields to prevent American fighters from interceptingAircraft carriers to prevent American fighters from interceptingBattleships the main objective of the attackCruisers and DestroyersMerchant ShippingPort Facilities like repair yards submarine pens and refueling tanksLand Installations like barracks radar facilities coastal defense batteries.Contrary to popular belief Yamamoto had insisted on the strike on Pearl Harbor to take out the US battleship line.  The reason was the entire Japanese war strategy involved building a defensive perimeter using overlapping island airbases to act as unsinkable aircraft carriers such that when the American counterattack came the Japanese could overcome their numerical disadvantage with a combination of landbased aircraft and naval forces thus annihilating the US fleet and hopefully coming to a negotiated peace.  To this end Yamamoto hoped to take out the main enemy battlelinethe US Pacific Fleet battleshipsat least long enough to buy more time for Japan to build up its perimeter.  And to an extent he succeededall the major targets the battleships were taken out.  Yamamoto and most of the Japanese navy with the exception of some people like Genda Ozawa and Yamaguchi saw naval power in the form of battleships.  Thus while the US carriers were a target it was primarily because the carriers could potentially strike back at Japans carrier force when it was vulnerableand Japan could not afford a war of attrition.  They did not see the carriers as a problem until the US started launching some carrier raids in February of  at which point Yamamoto started working on another scheme to take them out as well.  But thats another story.The Japanese were fully aware that the US war machine once in highgear would easily overwhelm the Japanese forces.  Kennedy noted that US industrial war capacity was something like x that of Japan in  and that was with the US still in economic trouble and Japan already somewhat mobilized due to the SinoJapanese War.  Their defensive strategy was fully in line with the hope of winning a short war with the US counter strike envisioned for  by which the Japanese envisioning a Mahanian Decisive Battle where the massed US fleet would sortie to the Philippines against the Japanese fleet and its island air bases would first slowly attrition it down with aircraft submarines and nighttime torpedo attacks then fight a massive battle inflicting such a severe defeat that the US would be willing to negotiate.  Yamamoto however failed to understand that not only had the US already begun to transition to a carrier doctrine and away from the Mahanian school of thought but also that attacking Pearl Harbor as they did would enrage the US precluding the idea of a negotiated peace.  The last thing to note is that Japan simply didnt have the logistical resourcesneither the troops nor the shipping to carry themto attempt an invasion of Hawaii.

It fascinating how gunpowder and naval technologies had given the British such an advantage especially when you consider both societies had roughly equivalent technologies if China wasnt a bit more advance a few centuries prior. Now a few centuries might seem like a rediculously long time to us now but to China it must of not seem like much would have changed. China was pre industrial at the time and Britian was just starting regular service on the new railroads. The divergence of the two societies that allows a small island nation to defeat one of the oldest and largest empires on Earth is pretty facinating. th century China shows that isolationism has a price. Sure Britian was in near constant warfare with the French  or the Dutch or the Americans but mostly with the French but after coming through the crucible they were an unrivaled world power. That warfare forced them to constantly improve on gun technology and naval technology while chinas stability of isolationism put their entire society at an dangerous technological disadvantage.,history,cxyznrv,41,t5_2qh53

Particularly because it was almost abandoned for not working as expected in many clinical trials early on. Some people may take issue with the word cure being used in the headline and thats fair. I would say though that it depends on your definition of cure. The idea that it means cancer is gone and will never come back is a little unreasonable since in many cases doctors cant say with certainty that cancer will never come back.

He risked his own wealth to raise an army for his king in an uncertain pursue of reputation and glory. And he was paid with envy when he succeded.

6064653,0,t1_cydzlsx,Well so the attack had not fizzled but it was in the process of losing strength. After the battles of the frontiers the French had been pushed back to their starting point and the main German force in the north was poised to take Paris. However logistics and the ability to move that force was fast becoming a problem. Another issue Moltke faced the force in the south the diversionary force which had also experienced success at a cost was dangerously exposed. Joffre was able to get his forces regrouped behind the marne faster than the German armies in the south could prepare. Meaning the main force meant to capture Paris would be dangerously exposed and isolated and the war would be over for the Germans. So Moltke withdrew forces to establish a better posture for his armies. The battle of the Marne took place the Germans consolidated and further withdrew you had the race to the sea then eventually the establishment of the Hindenburg line and stalemate. This obviously is a rather gross over simplification of the early stages of the war kind of general explanation.,history,cyekhds,3,t5_2qh53

6072367,0,t3_3yo2rg,Otto von Bismarck. He orchestrated the unification of Germany and thus created the machine that drove two world wars. Germany may well have unified in time regardless but he had a huge role in accelerating that process. Had he failed to do so who knows what Europe would look like today and whether there would have been such huge conflicts. It is food for thought. Some reasoning Not unifying Germany might have left France the dominant European military power. AustroHungary could well have gobbled up much of Germany and stuttered on. The Romanovs might not have fallen with support from other European countries with no world war to worry about. No USSR... Would the British Empire have collapsed? What I remember about Bismarck is patchy but I remember thinking he was quite remarkable and having quite a lot of admiration for his achuevements. The century preceeding WWI was one of relative peace  AKA Pax Britannica. This might have continued without a crazy Kaiser Wilhelm dragging Europe into costly war. Lack of allconsuming war might have kept Europe on more of a par with the US economically too.I feel the further back you look at this question the easier it is to answer due to butterfly effect of centuries if not millenia.,history,cyfkp59,6,t5_2qh53

6123068,0,t1_cyl3nfy,The answer to your question is yes. Today when thinking of Russia the legacy of WWII and the Cold War immediately makes us associate that country with superpower status. In Hitlers time this was very different. Back then Russias poor performance in the previous conflict coupled with aforementioned views of racial inferiority meant that the Germans feared the Russian climate a great deal more than they did its people. In fact the most stressful time in Hitlers political career up until this time had been the invasion of France in . Once the encirclement of the French proved successful and France rapidly buckled under the pressure Hitler was ecstatic. We must remember that the Wehrmacht thought technologically superior and better trained that theyre French adversaries was vastly outnumbered  to  essentially. For Hitler to kick down the door of the French army and bring the whole rotten edifice down was seen as proof of German invincibility if what was seen as the greatest contemporary land army in Europe could truly fall that easily. So yes Hitler was convinced that Russia would be the same story on a bigger scale. The disastrous winter campaign of that same year just added more to this megalomaniac vision. Finally for the first year of Barbarossa the leading consensus among the German high command was that all previous notions of racialmilitary inferiority on the part of the Soviets were being confirmed. How else could such massive encirclements be taking place? The Red Army didnt seem like the leviathan military that it would be forced to become over the course of the war instead it just seemed like a series of pockets of resistance just waiting to be snuffed out one be one. A cakewalk it very much seemed indeed. ,history,cylmnq1,3,t5_2qh53

Putting the actual incident aside for a moment it is what is being asked of the employees that is now called into question.  If there are leaks employees talking about Mrs. Smith in a disparaging manner they will be fired.

Mrs. Smith has a road ahead of her but in making the first steps down the road it would be nice to see her demonstrate some humility demonstrate some concern for those affected by her decisions instead of if I hear any of you employees making me topic of conversation around the water cooler you will be fired not a direct quote but premise is the same.

6318095,0,t3_4222ss,Not an expert but from what I recall the major dividing line stemmed from racism in the s during the Johnson administration. Lyndon B. Johnson was a Southern Democrat from Texas and at the time many Southerners were Democrats. If a switch exists its more based on NorthSouth lines with Southern racism being a big reason for the switch. Southern Democrats abandoned the party after the Civil Rights act of  which had slim Southern Democratic support and no Southern Republican support. The rhetoric around Republican national elections changed to play on the fears of white Southerners during the Civil Rights movement. Much like the Republican strategy in the early s was centered around the wedge issue of gay rights it was only because the wedge issue of race was taboo. And as much as the Democratic party is associated with government spending after the New Deal social issues were much more instrumental in driving voter registration and election results.A few more sources,history,cz7sp8u,4,t5_2qh53

6336734,0,t3_42dth7,I have to disagree with the top answer.The reason isThe USA needed an ally in the Pacific it needed a base. It needed MANY bases. Why? To fight the spread of Communism. We knew before the war even ended that Russia would spread as far and as fast as it could. Who was going to stop them in the East? No one! So the USA hushed up as much as they could. Kept as many of the trials as quiet and as secret as possible. To this day Japanese history books white wash the war. We let them do this. We needed an ally in the pacific and that EXACTLY what we got over the next decades a booming Japan that is the USAs best friend. And what happened? Exactly as we predicted Communism spread. China Vietnam Korea. We had two successful wars. Yes I said successful. MacArthur believed the same about the Vietnam war until the day he died he proclaimed Vietnam was not a failure. It stopped the spread of communism right then and there. TLDR Tojo was not as famous because the USA didnt want him to be. If you actually read nonwhite washed history you will realized what the Japanese did often eclipsed the horrors of the Nazis. ,history,cz9x0d7,3,t5_2qh53

6337109,0,t1_cz9stgx,Basically we were taught that in the beginning there were five patriarchs who shared power equally because the idea was no one single man should have all the power. Then as time went on the patriarch of Rome started to get a big head because he could trace his lineage back to one of the Apostles so he thought that gave him some kind of divine right to be the head of the church and the rest were basically like nah bro theres a reason we dont give one guy all the power. So they split up. If youre an outsider I can see how this might seem petty or stupid or whatever but its a pretty major difference when youre talking abut the history and doctrine of each church since the Schism. For example Greek Orthodox dont believe any person is infallible. The Pope may be Holy or whatever but that doesnt elevate him above human status. All humans can make mistakes. Also while the Catholic Church has changed its position on a lot of things the Byzantine church has really stayed the same. The only exception I can think of is that my church openly accepts gay people and has done so since before the new Pope made it fashionable. While the priest wont allow them to take part in the sacraments of communion or marriage they are welcome to the church otherwise. I say this is an exception it I actually dont know if this has gone on since the beginning or not but I highly doubt it. That all being said I really like the new pope and there are talks about the churches joining back together. But if thats going to happen the pope is going to have to step down to the level of the other four patriarchs. Edit just to add this it is obviously a subjective view and therefore by nature biased...but the part about splitting up as taught to us as the patriarch of Rome leaving the church and taking his followers with him and calling themselves Catholic meaning universal or more aptly worldwide and the other patriarchs adopting the name Orthodox meaning correct,history,cz9yjhr,11,t5_2qh53

6519363,0,t1_cztip20,Well. I mean yes and no. Christianity most assuredly took small aspects of the Roman Mysteries and Festivities. But thats always happened and its not so much about robbing the culture as absorption. The people continued to celebrate the old festivities pagans would revolt if their religions were blocked. Rome was largely open to many religions as long as you made your annual sacrifices to the Gods which would protect the city. Christians wouldnt make those sacrifices which is what lead to the early Christian Martyrs. So for a long while the old festivities continued alongside Christian Tradition until many of them were absorbed like the story of Mithras or Ishtar. Especially when other cultures became Christian they didnt want to abandon their old culture. You can see modern versions of this by looking at Mexican Catholicism and the Lady of Guadalupe. ,history,cztniuy,-2,t5_2qh53

6523117,0,t1_cztwtx4,Eh I disagree with this.We see many religious societies e.g. Muslims who memorize exceedingly large portions of the Quran. People regularly every bit of dialogue to entire movies and tv shows. People also regularly memorize lyrics to entire discographies of music.The last point is extremely pertinent because thats essentially how the ancient poets learned epic poems like The Iliad. Even more so those epic poems werent memorized word for word but were rather told in patterns so the poets would learn the pattern of the story and be able to fill in the blanks as needed. Also there are plenty of people who still have large portions of Shakespeares plays memorized or large portions of various poets memorized. Its unknowable but Id argue that as high a percentage of people living today have memorized one or more of Shakespeares plays as memorized The Iliad in ancient Greece it certainly wasnt a common thing back then to do either you know. ,history,czu1iv0,55,t5_2qh53

Its hard to appreciate the history of a place until youre fully immersed in it. I loved history as a kid and I was lucky enough to backpack through Italy and see the ruins in Rome for myself. Imagine if you dont have that kind of mobility  physically or financially. This would be the great equalizer.  Imagine the narrator of your choice crafting a tour for you e.g. Zahi Hawass David Attenborough etc.. Even better putting together a tour of places typically inaccessible to the public? How nice would it be to walk through sites like this one virtually without bumping into other tourists or struggling to keep up with a rushing tour guide? Introducing even the most difficult subject matter to students  like walking through Auschwitz or standing on the battlefields of Gettysburg. Taking existing photographs or video of sites and superimposing them into the virtual experience. creating reenactments that are as close to historically accurate as possible to experience a day in the life right in front of you  almost like time travelling. This is the future of history that Id like to see. As the old adage goes Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

6536485,0,t1_czvdd5r,Social mobility in Rome was really limited. Most wealth was tied up in land which was inherited. Rome was also incredibly class and status conscious. There was also very little middle class to speak of a few incredibly rich people and lots and lots of poor people. Obviously there was no public eduction system so eduction was reserved for the children of the rich. I imagine some poorer people managed to pull themselves up through the social hierarchy through success at trade and business but this is hard to discern from the sources and would have been very much the exception. The most obvious examples of social mobility in the Roman empire was through the army many of the later emperors come from very humble backgrounds. IIRC one of these emperors Diocletian formalised into law that you must follow your fathers profession. That said such a law would have been quite difficult to implement and its difficult to gauge its impact. Nevertheless you would have been extremely unlikely to break out of your social class in ancient Rome and your options were very constrained.,history,czvfbej,3,t5_2qh53

At that point no universally sanctioned Scriptures or Christian Bible existed. Various churches and officials adopted different texts and gospels. Thats why the Council of Hippo sanctioned  books for the New Testament in  C.E. Four years later the Council of Cartage confirmed the same  books as the authoritative Scriptures of the Church. The Church actually discouraged the populace from reading the Bible on their own  a policy that intensified through the Middle Ages and later with the addition of a prohibition forbidding translation of the Bible into native languages. In France Louis VIII decreed in  that persons excommunicated by the diocesan bishop or his delegate should receive meet punishment debita animadversio. In  Louis IX ordered barons to deal with heretics according to the dictates of duty de ipsis faciant quod debebant.

6622882,0,t3_46d58j,A book with interesting facts about the Native Americans is Stephen Ambroses Undaunted Courage. I cant believe nobody is recommending this yet.  The important thing to note is that the Native Americans had a lot of diversity.  They had their own stories of how the world began. Different languages. Different nations.   Some tribes that Lewis and Clark describe were long gone by the time the rest of the country started heading west.  Something interesting that is discussed in Undaunted Courage  During the first winter of the expedition they established a camp near a friendly tribe.  Throughout the winter they used their skills to trade with the Natives.  At one point during the winter they salvaged the metal from one of their stoves to make a tomahawk. On the return trip after advancing west as planned reaching the pacific and turning back they found one of these tomahawks that had made it over the Rockies through the trading routes.  It made it from the eastern side of the Rockies to the western side of the Rockies. Thats just something that I think is very cool and just scratches the surface when discussing tribes relations with other tribes.  The political message that Lewis and Clark took...its just a really fun book to read because it gives you a peek at how they treated each other too.  Its not the fairy tale that Ive been seeing people post about on this.  There were classes amongst them there were hungry people.  Their war tribes were ruthless against each other not just the white man.  ,history,d04d2nw,3,t5_2qh53

6638403,0,t1_czx0ir8,Thank you for replying I find this extremely interesting though the mods might think this a bit of a sidestep. I looked up the casualty statistics here and it looks like youre right on the markThe US casualties were double the French but are of course spread out across two theaters of war. It is generally accepted that  Americans died liberating France and about  for all other nations in the ETO. I would have to look it up although you could probably help but I imagine French casualties would spike in the summer of  and then drop dramatically until the summer of  in which they would climb considerably until VE Day. As you said this would not include all other casualties in the resistance in all of its forms organized and nonorganized. I wasnt aware that Vichy Petain Laval etc. ordered the colonial governors to capitulate to the Allies in North Africa though I know there were many that did willingly and of course scores of military units changed sides to join Darlan LeClerc etc. Can you point me in that direction in terms of a text?

6667134,0,t3_46vy2t,Honestly it is a tricky and quite frankly impossible question because even though we can usually measure the impact many nations have had on the world it is ranking that impact that becomes most important.One could argue that the first cities like Uruk were the most influential because they were well the first and thus set precedent but many of their cultural values and social practices have been long forgotten.Basically civilization is one big snowball effect and so I think that civilizations cant really be more influential than one another. In the snowball case you can influence what direction the snowball will move in but it will still continue to pick up more snow all the same. You can even change what kind of snow it picks up pristine snow fluffy snow dirty snow but in the end it will just get packed in all the same.I suppose the idea of influence is what legacy has been created so if I must answer I would have to go with the flow and choose Rome. Rome laid the foundations for western civilization and in turn western civilization overtook the world thus catapulting the legacy of Rome forward. But still it is just more snow packed into the ball.,history,d08xtup,6,t5_2qh53

6675002,0,t1_d08l069,Sure the tactics were antiquated at the start of the war. Over the course of the next six years massive tactical innovations evolved in logistics artillery creeping barrage etc air power from unarmed observers through to squadrons bombers and the flying circus effective assault troops storm troopers and tank warfare too. Culminating in what turned out to be an early version of combined arms doctrine which worked pretty well too. Again with hindsight one could make a decent argument this didnt happen fast enough and too many of the attritional warfare enthusiasts were listened to  but that isnt really the level you are arguing at. The allied and central powers armed forces of  could have kicked the arses of their  equivalents on any sort of even odds so hard it isnt even funny. Tragically a heck of a lot of the doctrinal lessons learned were then forgotten by WW which may be part of the reason the mistaken idea that WW armies didnt innovate tactically has taken root.And if you think thats the only time tactics and doctrine have instantly failed to update you are sadly mistaken. For example allied forces in Iraq after Gulf War  were rather better trained and equipped for projected European Cold War battles than Middle eastern insurgency suppression.

6685613,0,t3_477x7p,From WikipediaDuring the Nanking Massacre Magee was performing missionary work in Nanking and was at the same time the chairman of Nanking Committee of the International Red Cross Organization. During the period when hundreds of thousands of defenseless Chinese were slaughtered by the Japanese army Magee was appalled by the atrocity of the Japanese invaders.Disregarding his own safety Magee ran out of the Nanking Safety Zone going through streets and lanes and took part in rescuing more than  Chinese soldiers and civilians who were facing being slaughtered. Magee shot several hundred minutes of film with what was then the most advanced mm movie camera which filmed at  shots per second.Some people wanted to buy Magees original film for large sums of money for political purposes yet he would not budge. He said he wanted to give the historical materials to the right person without charge at the right moment.Magee managed to film abuses of Chinese civilians by Japanese soldiers during the Nanking Massacre in December . Magees films were smuggled out of Nanking copies were shown to members of the United States government and sent to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade them to institute sanctions against the Japanese government.On  February  Legation Secretary of the German Embassy Rosen wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee to recommend its purchase. Here is an excerpt from his letter and a description of some of its shots kept in the Political Archives of the Foreign Ministry in Berlin.During the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking  which by the way continues to this day to a considerable degree  the Reverend John Magee a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese. .... One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed as they have indicated in stopping the activities of their troops which continue even today ...According to the Asahi Shinbun on Dec.   this photo is Rev. John Magee holding a Sunday worship service and singing hymns with Chinese Christians in Nanking after order had been restored to the city. Magees role in documenting the Nanking Massacre is featured in the movie Dont Cry Nanking.

So it wasnt so much that the South specifically loved slavery its that they didnt want the North doing anything that would threaten their incomes thats not to say there werent tons of proslavery people though.

6745417,0,t3_483fjf,My favorite thing about history is that EVERYTHING has a history. A lot of students find history really boring. Its a bunch of dead guys and the stuff they did how is this important to my life today? Why do I need to know about the crap that they did? Thats the most common thing I hear in classrooms I substitute teach at a high school. So I always say the usual teachery things Oh its about learning from the past to help the future. But when that doesnt work I ask students to think about something they really like. Music snowboarding skateboarding dancing drawing writing.....EVERYTHING has a history of its own. Where would todays hit artists be without the Harlem Renaissance? The inventions of instruments melodies and rhythm. How have they changed to adapt to whats popular today? Where would skateboarding and snowboarding be without those who did it first? How has drawing and painting evolved over the past  years. Whats the difference between fashion now and fashion in the s? Do styles repeat themselves just like the old saying history repeats itself suggests? The real trick is connecting the subject to something that matters. Maybe take a break from the textbook material if you can I know time can be an issue and get them to look into the history of something that is interesting to them. Students find value in lessons that have meaning. If that means pulling away from the textbook give it a try. ,history,d0h173n,1,t5_2qh53

Whose idea for ending the war was to call for a Leveeenmasse basically shutting down the economy and waging a ruinous asymmetrical campaign on Belgian French and German soil?They may have had flashy uniforms but the fact that Germany fought two major wars and lost them both after  is a pretty damning indictment of the Imperial Army whose Officer Corps subsequently formed the leadership of the Wehrmacht.,history,d0r8xsm,3,t5_2qh53

6863160,0,t3_49puyq,Nellie Bly one of the first female journalists wanted to work for the New York World. To prove herself to the papers owner Joseph Pulitzer she volunteered to be locked inside Blackwells Asylum in New York for a week to do a piece on the horrors that were supposedly occurring there. The only problem was getting into the asylum which would not allow outsiders in. Blys solution? Feign insanity and get committed. So Bly joined a womens home and pretended to be utterly insane. Eventually the other women there began to fear for their lives so they committed Bly to the asylum. Bly spent about a week as a patient there writing about the terrible conditions and mistreatment of residents. After her week was up she informed the guard that she was actually completely sane and was working for the New York World. Obviously nobody believed her. She was there for another week before Pulitzer sent someone to go get her. Bly published what she wrote while locked up in Blackwells read Ten Days in a Madhouse! an article that effectively shut down the asylum several years later. This was one of the first examples of investigative journalism as well. She wound up working for the World until her death.

For the record I will probably vote for Hillary for feminist reasons The question was about the morality of Tesla so that is what I was addressing. OPs basis for questioning Teslas morality wasnt based on anything real philosophically therefore delusional and ammoral and Ayn Rand is the first philosopher to directly attack this false ideology of Christianitys holy poverty. There is nothing inherently evil about being rich. A rich man can be evil but this isnt based on how much money they have. Sometimes it may be based on HOW they made that money but not always. The period of time Tesla existed was famous for giving birth to the modern businessman and entrepreneur which is directly linked to some political ideas of the now but I didnt intend to make a comment on current politics at all. If you think it is perhaps you need to step back and realize most people dont know who JP Morgan is or Ayn Rand you probably know more than you think you do and much more than other people. The op states The social media paint him as a very poor guy who dedicated all his efforts towards helping humanity. But I learned that he was actually a very rich manAs if the social media is trying to paint him as being poor here synonymous with good in the OPs thought process and then the supposedly sinister revelation gasp that he was actually rich. The horror. Tesla deserved to be rich and being rich doesnt make one evil. Evil is just evil with or without money. JP Morgan is a good example of a rich man who used his riches to help humanity. He was the American Medici patriarch. Many artist speak highly of him I am an artist. But we could look at Bill and Melinda Gates with their great contributions to society as well not only from the perspective of Gates inventions which help me every day of my life but their altruistic contributions to global health issues. Gates would still be good without the altruism just as Steve Jobs is still good even though he wasnt known for altruism. Steve Jobs didnt sacrifice himself he lived for himself and made a lot of money. He benefitted everyone in many indirect ways even despite the grotesque human rights violations at the factories in China which are the fault of Chinas labor policies more directly.

Tesla was working on a huge tower to provide electricity wireless electricity. The thing is his ideals did not match up with his investors because his tower would provide free electricity to anyone in range. If you are curious about wireless electricity you can do a small experiment urself if you have one of those toy plasma balls.. If you take a light bulb and hold it a few inches away from it it will light up. This is the extremely watered down explanation. Basically he was a visionary but he wasnt all about money so thats why it didnt work out for him. And thats why we dont learn about him. He didnt follow the agenda. He was obscure and and weird. Kinda like those free energy people now a days. They call them crazy and weird. Kinda like how we dont hear much about water powered cars and fossil free energy. Its all about money and propaganda. Also there was a huge fightdebate between Alternating Current and Direct Current energy.

Greeks in which I understand youre interested Vandals Ostrogoths Arabs Normans Spanish... and these are just a few. There have been many migrations which could have even started your family by what we now. Since its really hard to go back so many generations we really cant tell when and in what area of Sicily your family started and I think its safer to not assume anything. On the other hand its obvious sackings cant be so complete and absolute as you say there are always survivors and runaways but theres another interesting element other than wars and sackings. Theres mt. Etna which in many occasions has deleted from the face of Earth entire cities and villages. Lets assume your ancestors lived in Eastern Sicily. Depending on the area your ancestors lived in I mean in which area of the Etnean territory if youve got any informations about the origins of your family there can be higher or lower probabilities that your genealogical tree has deep roots. Heres an interesting video about Etna eruptions from  to  although its in Italian. A particular event was the  eruption which caused more than . deaths in many important cities such as Nicolosi Misterbianco and Catania itself and in small villages. You can find more info about older eruptions on Wikipedia and if you youve got a friend who speaks Italian you can have himher help you with historical texts such asGiuseppe Recupero detailed description of Etnas known volcanic activity from Prehistory to the Nineteenth century. Other than all this boring shit we can tell Sicily has always been a melting point in the Mediterranean sea until today. There havent been any nuclear explosions trust me Sicily has never been empty during history so there isnt any problem with saying you may have had at least one relative in Ancient Syracuse but  years are really a lot and the only thing you can do is imagine the story of your family.Hope I helped and sorry for my bad English.

There were only two people involved in the decision to launch the ARPAnet my boss the Director of ARPA Charles Herzfeld and me.gtNumerous untruths have been disseminated about events surrounding the origins of the ARPAnet. Here are some facts.gtThe creation of the ARPAnet was not motivated by considerations of war.gtMany people have heard that the Internet began with some military computers in the Pentagon called Arpanet in . The theory goes on to suggest that the network was designed to survive a nuclear attack. However whichever definition of what the Internet is we use neither the Pentagon nor  hold up as the time and place the Internet was invented. A project which began in the Pentagon that year called Arpanet gave birth to the Internet protocols sometime later during the s but  was not the Internets beginnings. Surviving a nuclear attack was not Arpanets motivation nor was building a global communications network.gtBob Taylor the Pentagon official who was in charge of the Pentagons Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or Arpanet program insists that the purpose was not military but scientific. The nuclear attack theory was never part of the design. Nor was an Internet in the sense we know it part of the Pentagons  thinking.

Its just that the farther you got from your homeland and closer to someone elses the language shifts like color shifts from red to blue on a spectrum. Bilingualism is essentially being fluent in two different languages. What travelers experienced going from country to country is one language slowly becoming another. Imagine there is a village called Alpha where every human on earth is a citizen and they all speak one language. There are no other humans anywhere. Easy right? We all speak the same language and we all live really close. Now a few people set off in search of greener grass. As they migrate out they set up colonies where some stay and some continue on. As they go they discover new plants and animals so they give them names. Those names are known to the new village Bravo but not to the village Alpha that they originally left. Something new has been added to the language. Its known to Bravo but not to Alpha. Lets also say that there are plants and animals near Alpha that are not living near Bravo. Eventually Bravo forgets the name of those animals and something is forgotten or lost. Or perhaps the telephone game happens and the name of the animal becomes something new due to mispronunciation. Their language has begun to change. Well generations later by the time village Romeo is founded the language has changed completely due to new words being needed old ones forgotten and the telephone game has altered shared ones we have a new language! So I wouldnt think bilingualismmultilingualism was necessarily common but it wasnt an alien concept either. And Im sure there were people who made a conscious effort to keep both old and new alive for they saw the value of both. And it assuredly became more complicated as we evolved.

I was told that they believed this disfiguring of the symbol would destroy any special religious or power specially provided by the Gods of War. Every rifle which was disbursed aboard the carrier had to be defaced in this manner. The bayonets which went with the rifles had a mark on them also but I believe this mark was merely the armament mark signifying where the bayonet was made but these marks were not disfigured.gtThere were many rifles taken aboard the carrier and distributed to the crew. I could not make any estimate as to how many were distributed but do remember many small boat loads of them coming to the Carrier.

Theories include a waterspout making the crew believe they were taking on water at a rapid rate and abandoning the ship a seaearthquake damaging the cargo to such a degree that the crew thought it might explode the captain fearing that the ship was in imminent danger of hitting a reef and jumping in the lifeboat and God knows what else.I havent explained these vary well but there is plenty of material on the case available where the numerous theories are examined in detail and you can decide which one you believe if any.

6994367,0,t3_4bh0b6,Read Adrian Goldsworthy and Peter Heather.  They present the best modern opposing arguments for why Rome fell. TL DR  Heather argues that the barbarians became increasingly wealthy and sophisticated after centuries of contact and trade with Rome and because strong enough to take Rome on as equals.  Heather argues that the Roman army destroyed itself through near constant civil wars and that the combination of lack of manpower debased currency and the failure of traditional forms of social involvement lead Rome to crack apart...the barbarians simply picked up the pieces.In addressing this topic one must remember that Romes wealth was essentially based on a plunder economy.  Eventually Rome ran out of wealthy places that could be conquered yet they had the same or higher costs for the army infrastructure and foreign aid. The empire in fact broke apart into  competing empires during the crisis of the rd century.  It was only due to repeated military conquest and a very enlarged army that political control was reestablished. By the end of the rd century crisis the principate had lost all legitimacy and political power was wielded by the strongest generals..most of whom were from the provinces with little or no connection to Rome.   Constantine attempted to reestablish imperial legitimacy based on his new Catholic religion. This too ultimately failed.Add in depopulation caused by a number of plagues large plantation farms failing because the soil was overworked and increasingly oppressive inkind taxation and a constant need for soldiers it is not surprising that Rome needed to look to barbarian groups for manpower and that the warlords form these tribes grew in importance and eventually wrestled effective political control away from Rome.,history,d195kdb,3,t5_2qh53

7005130,0,t3_4bm8xf,The first usage of the nomer Kurd was in the th century but most of the earliest accounts regarding the Kurds can be found in later sources depicting events of the th century. These earliest confirmable places of Kurdish inhabitation are important to research which preKurdish tribespeoples became Kurds when the nomer developed. For later centuries the movement of Kurds is better known. Here are two maps regarding Kurdish dynasties and dispersion during the thth and th centuries made by Boris James a researcher on Kurds in the Middle Ages. As you can see by the Middle Ages the Kurds inhabited a large majority of the regions they do now.th centuriesth century overlaid with Turkic dynastiesNow theres of course contention as to what the exact meaning of Kurd was in those early centuries. A common assertion is that it was a general nomer for nomadic Iranic populations. As centuries passed Kurd became stricter in its definition and the earliest ethnographic use of the term may be found in the th century with clear instances of Kurdish solidarity in Ayyubid times and earlier.Some things may look odd. Where there no Kurds further northwest? I couldnt find a reference for that for this specific time period. However the ethnic composition of the regions conquered by the Arabs often werent mentioned so its possible. Others may question why Kurds were found so far into the southeast these likely constituted the Lurs a people who historically were referred to as Kurds and indeed shared much the same lifestyle but whose language is closer to Persian and descends from Old Persian. Now the majority of this people as far as I know identifies as Lur Iranian andor Persian. They are not to be confused with Lak and Feylis. Note that this is about the Kurdish dispersion and is not meant to negate the large presence Armenians Assyrians and other peoples had in this region during this time.Based on translations of Arabic Persian and Syriac sources. Most of the Persian and Arabic sources were written postth century and mention the Kurds in defiance of the Muslim Conquests in the th century. The Syriac sources are both pre and postIslamic and use such terms as Kartawaye Khurdaye Khurdanaye and Mark for Kurds.Maps usedAbbassid ProvincesJaziraJibal,history,d1adjnh,3,t5_2qh53

On the flip side though it definitely can be overdone and there is a place for more natural remedies. As for avoiding OTC painkillers. For me I use essential oils. I know some people believe they dont work and I absolutely recognize it could be a placebo but I honestly believe they do work. At the end of the day though what matters to me is I feel less pain when I use them. If that is something you are interested in here is my advice go with a good company. Go with somewhere you could potentially visit if you wanted to and see how they do business. The company I go with grows all of their own plants bottles and distributes. They do their own and third party testing. Ive seen how they throw bad batches away and Ive experienced oils being OOS because of it.

Even if some experiments led to interesting data it was performed on subjects who were malnourished regularly tortured and in an extreme mental state  not the most ideal group to perform medical trials on.

7128278,0,t1_d1oeeqp,Long post incoming...Post World War I two trains of economic doctrine emerged Ignore Russia for now the first was an introspective look at economic reconstruction the second was a collaborative economic reconstruction. Moreover most economies were devastated after World War I. However for numerous reasons the United States actually came out ahead and ended up as a net creditor to impoverished European nations. During this same time New York became the global financial capital that it still is. When postWorld War I sovereign debt was set in the Paris Peace Conference in  Germany was tasked with repaying massive punitive war reparations to France and Great Britian and France and Great Britian owed money to Private US Syndicates and the US Government. The overall result was a decision to take the first economic doctrine each country is responsible for rebuilding itself using its own tax revenue and debt owed to it. Economist J.M. Keynes wrote what you could consider a dissenting opinion of the Paris Peace Conference called The Economic Consequences of Peace. A very good read if you have the time Move forward to the  the United States had entered a Great Depression. Ill skip covering ALL the causes of the GD but suffice to say the prewar gold standard and the failing European markets were two major underlying causes. The gold standard had fallen apart and Forex markets and bond prices were swinging rapidly. A company in America couldnt sell to consumers in Europe due to such fluctuations. On top of all this Hitler had just been elected and declared himself Third Reich.So the Allied Powers namely America France and Great Britian gathered in London at the famous  World Economic Conference. Going into these negotiations two key things needed to happen to avert World War . First the United States need to make debt concessions to Great Britian which owed four billion dollars and in return France and Great Britian would forgive Germany its debt. In good faith France and GB had already forgiven most of Germanys debt prior to Hitler coming to power. Secondly the United States needed to establish a fixed exchange rate to settle European markets. So why didnt FDR go ahead and commit to these global economic reforms? Because FDR had spent his first  days as president working on the New Deal and the programs that came with it. Up at the plate WHILE he was in London was NIRA which FDR wanted to be part of his legacy as president. NIRA is where the frequently shared on Facebook quote about a liveable wage comes from. Moreover these global economic reforms would initially set back the the US workers and businesses by forcing them to compete with Europe. Although it would have stabilized the US and European markets and many economists at the time even argued the United States still would have benefited in the long run. FDR put the US economy and his legacy as the creator of the New Deal ahead of the global economy it closed the door for negotiations and led to a every nation for itself mentality. This mentality not only prolonged the American and European depressions but ultimately lead to armed conflict in .June th    June th    July rd    Side note FDRs statements about a liveable wage are more about ensuring businesses didnt have to compete with European goods and labor rather than about actually providing for the most impoverished Americans. The conference was considered a complete failure following the July rd wire and FDR had successfully blown any chance to end the depression early and possibly prevent World War . The only European nation that had a favorable view of the US in July  was Nazi Germany I find it strange that our young State should receive gratuitous advice from the representatives of nations whose situation is so near catastrophe that their own troubles might be expected to engage all their attention.

7130079,0,t1_d1o6ust,A. When people go into this popularly on Reddit they seem to assume that the southern strategy was the beginning and the ending of the parties switching sides. Basically how did the abolitionist republicans turn into the racist party of today?No one ever got back to the New Deal which was opposed strongly by many republicans because the high taxes obviously that sort of thing is objective and subjective at the same time so I dont care to go into it on the wealthy and many New Deal programs that the republicans saw as govt overreach. Now these new deal programs chiefly benefitted poor whites and especially in the south where the democrats had a lot of support and the republicans had little. Well thats not completely true. Blacks wouldve been republicans but their ability to vote was massively suppressed by everything from poll taxes to literacy tests to terrorism. The next part of this switch is the great migration of poor southern blacks to industrial cities in the north to escape oppression and try to find jobs. What you find is that after a generation or two of those migrant black families living and working in the city they become democrats as democrats have usually been prolittle guy or pro worker. They were much closer to the Tribunes of republican Rome than the patrician senators who are much closer to our ideas of US republicans. Anyway after this influx of blacks into major northern cities northern democrats realized that The black vote was going to be essential when it came to elections in big cities and the democrats in the north wanted to lock down the black vote. So at the  DNC northern democrats wanted to adopt a pro civil rights platform. Moderates in the party were not a fan of this because they felt it would alienate southern voters who were indispensable to the Democratic Party at the time. Famously multiple southern conservatives walked out of the convention in protest. The Republican Party was similarly fractured. There were the old money northeast republicans who are more like RINOs as they were more likely to be pronew deal or at least not strongly antinew deal and there were the Old Right which was based more in the Midwest. The Old Right were similar to modern republicans in their fiscal views. It was a movement concerned with combatting FDRs policies of increasing the size of the federal govt spending and the added rhetorical flair of calling him a dictator in the same folks called Bush and Obama a nazi. Now we tend to look back at the New Deal with rosecolored glasses but despite good initial showings the mid to late s held multiple problems as the govt tried to navigate the new bloat riots longterm unemployment.This all leads up to the civil rights movement where northern democrats who wanted the black vote they could have also just been moral people but of course morality usually only does wonders when paired with the opportunity of gain against immorality clashed with the base of the Democratic Party southern whites. For a while this actually benefitted democrats as they sort of had their cake and ate it too through the the s and s. In fact after  when Roosevelt and his new deal came into office Democrats won the majority of the house and senate every year except  and  when Eisenhower was elected. Now the democrats had control of congress for almost  years but liberal policy in the modern sense was often blocked by the coalition of conservatives that was joined by Southern democrats and Midwestern republicans. Another change to to take into account is war. During WWII the democrats were more prowar while the republicans were isolationists. American culture wasnt exactly anti war until Vietnam. It was at this point that republicans said war was necessary to combat communism and the democrats eventually decided that suburban housewives seeing their dead children on the news was a losing battle. Anyway The Civil Rights Act marked the end of the period where democrats could benefit from both southern conservatives and northern liberals in their party. This of course led to the  and  DNC being shits shows. After  years of dominating American politics the Democratic Party was finally reaping what it had sown.However the Democrats were not dumb. Although more Republicans voted for the Civil Rights act it was still a Democrat President who got it passed and who enforced it. And entering Vietnam helped to sidetrack the discussion. So now were in the s. The south was taking a few extra years to integrate and wasnt exactly easy in Boston or other working class cities in the northeast. At one point the democrats would angrily denounce things like forced bussing and some did but going forward Democrats needed to worry about two voting blocs proworker and union factions the working man in the industrialized sense and the black vote. For maybe a century or two the working man was who the democrats appealed to. Ideally thats who they appeal to currently the man lowest on the totem pole. For a while thats what Midwest and southern farmers were. They were the working man the embodiment of the American Dream. However combined with growing disillusionment with the way democrats were becoming more occupied with cityfolk concerns and the massive shift in population from rural to urban during the the time of the depression through the post war boom it was no longer the best strategy for democrats to appeal to southerners. The southern vote due to population shifts and the post war boom of northern industrial cities was no longer nearly as valuable to the democrats. Used to the republicans could get elected in the big cities but not the rural areas. Now the democrats could take big cities but they were starting to say and do things that rural conservatives didnt agree with. The democrats had to decide whether it was worth losing in richer urban areas so they could still be the party of the rural farmers. They decided that the black vote was more valuable.The republicans are now the party of fiscal responsibility and following the post war boom thats not a terribly popular policy. But fiscal conservatism gets a boost with the downturn in the s. Carter is elected but one could say that had a lot to do with Nixons resignation and the fact that Carter was a southerner and a Washington outsider. Carters inability to turn the economy around and his handling of Iran whether he did the right thing or not his results were easy to criticize at the time. As all of these events come together we get the Republican strategy to undermine the Democratic Party by appealing to the rural working man that used to be the base of the Democratic Party. Conversely The republicans are losing their ability to win in urban areas because of the growing bloc of workers rights and minority rights becoming more prominent and those blocs now going to democrats making it much harder for republicans to take those areas. So how do they make up for their losses in the cities? Go rural and attack the democrats in their soft spot. For near  years democratic politicians would say nigger  times per stump speech in the south especially before the migration of blacks out of the south in the first half of the th century. The democrats had already set the rhetorical infrastructure for racist campaigning. Savvy republicans saw that infrastructure and changed the appearance of the rhetoric. Instead of saying as the democrats might have whites must take their destined role as leader the republicans paired their fiscal responsibility platform along with anti Union anti tax anti feminist anti bussing and anti black sentiment basically they were antiurban ideas and used this as the basis for an ideological war. People living in rural areas often have a fear of metropolises and republicans capitalized. So from one point of view the republicans were merely repurposing fiscal conservatism to appeal to uneducated racists but from the view of the racists they were being appealed to after they had been ignored obviously they hadnt been ignored the democrats had been actively trying to distance themselves. More than anything the republicans use of the southern strategy was arguably more the result of a twoparty system where one party has a reason not to attempt to appeal to a voting bloc whose interests it should be representing. The democrats should be appealing to the working class whites because of their pro labor values but the racism inherent in southern politics makes it harder for democrats to seek their support without severe backlash from urban progressives. So here comes the republicans to the rescue saving working class racist whites from proworking class politics it should also be mentioned that money for social programs is much easier to come by in meteopolises than in rural areas. Higher taxes are easier to justify when you can point to all the infrastructure around your community that needs attention but that point falls off when there just aint much around. This is key to understanding the appeal of republican rhetoric in the south.Tildr the black vote became more important to the democrats than the rural southern white vote and the republicans being the only other party available took advantage after the democrats had locked them out of the urban areas in the aftermath of the new deal.,history,d1olyxz,0,t5_2qh53

7171122,0,t1_d1t20de,Had the Germany army started Barbarossa earlier they would have had solid ground to travel on and it would have been easier for them to make their advances and keep up their supply lines.  Instead they lost time and wore out their men and machinery fighting the fall rainy season.  I know from experience that traveling over prairie gumbo is very hard and even destructive on equipment since the machinery has to work much harder to plow its way through it.I had always heard that the early winter of  had extremely cold weather but will stand corrected after finding this weather graph taken from Moscow.  Even though the temperatures were not extremely cold it still took its toll on the German soldiers and reduced their fighting ability since they did not have adequate cold weather gear.  I have not found records of the wind speeds around Russia during this time but after spending time working in the Northern Canadian Prairies I can say that the wind chill on a moderately cold day is much harder on a person than no wind on an extremely cold day.General Zhukov  himself had claimed that the Germans were very close to taking Moscow in .  If Hitler had begun his attack as planned in May it is doubtful that the Russian reinforcements could have brought in in time to save Moscow.The United States had stayed neutral up until December of .  Germany was buying oil and other materials from her through Occupied France and Spain right up until December of that year. but they did not declare war on Germany until December   After Hitler declared war on her.  If Hitler had attacked earlier Germany would have been in Moscow well before Pearl Harbour.  There are many historians that believe that Hitler only declared war on the United States because he figured that Japan would join him by declaring war on Russia thus putting Russia in the disadvantage of fighting a two front war and having to pull troops away from the Eastern Theater.  Fortunately for the rest of the world Hitlers thinking backfired on him.  Not only did Japan stay in the Pacific but now the United States had become Russias Ally and soon began ferrying warplanes and other military supplies and equipment to Russia under the lendlease programs.Hitler ended up losing many of his trading partners from the Allied countries and was then doomed to continue his war efforts alone with a much reduced supply of war materials against an enemy that now included probably the largest industrial nation in the world.This is why I feel that the Balkans had a much worse effect for Hitler than losing Stalingrad did.,history,d1taf4u,1,t5_2qh53

7264874,0,t1_d23xpn1,From Wikipedia entry on Nazism and its position on the political spectrumThe majority of scholars identify Nazism in practice as a form of farright politics. Farright themes in Nazism include the argument that superior people have a right to dominate over other people and purge society of supposed inferior elementsNotice the part about farright politics.Wikipedia article on CommunismIn political and social sciences communism from Latin communis common universal is a social political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes money and the state.The section on Nazism specified that a central point of the philosophy of Nazism was an opposition to Communism. The Nazis supported businesses and Capitalism although of course they bent it towards supporting their political and Nationalistic aims. There was pretty much nothing that I am aware of in the Nazi philosophy that was Socialist in nature beyond the name I see this much as the use of Democratic by many totalitarian Communist governments like that of The Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea which is neither Democratic nor a Republic as far as I can see. Communism is fundamentally opposed to the Capitalist economic and political structure and is seen as an extreme left wing political position by most people I believe. Nazism supported the Capitalist economic system to the extent of supplying slave labour to make it more effective even. The fact that it also mixed in Racism and Eugenics doesnt alter the political position on the far right.Socialism represents a mix of the two positions to my thinking it accepts the Capitalist economic system but it sees some elements of society and the economy as being the purview of the government. It taxes more heavily and controls some aspects of the economy thus restricting the capitalism to a greater degree than a more right wing position but it isnt inherently totalitarian in nature as either of the extreme Left or Right positions inevitably end up being. This is confused of course by the fact that Communists in Communist controlled nations viewed themselves as Socialists who had yet to achieve the Communist state they saw as desirable.So I do not agree that National Socialism is Socialism at all its a philosophy that sought to convince the workers of Germany that it was representing them by borrowing the monicker of Socialism. I do agree that under both systems the government in the form of the State was the most  important element of the political system and that the individual was subject to the will of the State but the nature of that State was completely different in its approach to managing society and the economy. Both were equally vile but that is more due to the fact that they were so extreme that they lost sight of the importance of the individual generally speaking and the result were horrible tragedies involving the deaths of millions. Socialism in the US though seems to be viewed as being far closer to Communism rather than a more middle position politically. I think that its been demonized thoroughly by the right in the US over the past  years because it threatens the control of the rich and powerful over society. Even though western society already has many socialist elements in it Police services Fire Services some Medical support systems National Parks etc etc. Those are services maintained by the government for the benefit of the governed by and large and yes I am aware that in some areas of the US these things are privatized and run as companies apparently. Thats still not the norm throughout the US though. Up here in Canada we have Crown Corporations that handle things like Electrical Power BC Hydro for instance or the Ferries BC Ferries Can you guess I am in BC?. These are government owned corporations which means they work like a regular corporation more or less and even have some degree of independence from the government but they are supposed to operate more or less at cost and surplus revenue goes to the government. These things are Socialism but they are hardly Communism. To offer what I would see as a correction to one of your comments up aboveCapitalists blame Communists. Communists blame Capitalists. Socialists sit in between and seek to curb the excesses of Raw Capitalism while adopting some of the better elements of Communism and avoiding the extremes of both  in my view at least.  ,history,d23yqur,6,t5_2qh53

7273886,0,t3_4f0bi7,It is only in the last  years or so that people have routinely saved money in interest bearing accounts but people have always saved money eg stuffed it in the mattress or by storing hard assets for later use.  However when people dont save their assets in a liquid form it is difficult for large economies to function properly.  A good example of this was the Weimar Republic of the s.  In that case hyperinflation created a situation where people were incentivized to use their liquid assets as quickly as possible and sellers were incentivized to hold onto their hard assets as long as possible.  Such a situation makes it very difficult for people to get the goods they need in a timely manner and eventually the economy shrinks.  One other economic advantage of storing liquid assets with a bank is that it provides the money the bank can then use to make loans thereby stimulating the economy.  With these economic advantages to liquid savings it is natural for banks and governments to want to incentivize liquid savings which is essentially what savings interest does.  If you took away interest on savings there would still be a strong desire to get people to deposit their money in banks and therefore another incentive would be devised.  So to answer the question succinctly the lack of interest savings could theoretically cause economic harm but because governments and banks still need to keep their liquid economies healthy in practice other forms of incentives would be devised to encourage people to make deposits.,history,d24zqav,1,t5_2qh53

More often then not the idea was to create an economic dependency by enticing the Raj or king or khan with British markets for his goods.  This meant that sometimes local rulers got advisors or were replaced if they decided to suddenly become protectionist or isolationist.  Britain often got so involved in this way that leaving would have had a very adverse affect on the British economy so the government would often step in ensure the favorable terms continued.This is more or less how they wound up with India...a lot of local agreements backed up with advisors and force and eventually they were in so deep they couldnt leave without a huge upheaval in trade.

My best guess is that he was involved in intel gathering in the Pacific. His info is deliberately ambiguous. His generation were good at keeping secrets especially if they were sworn to secrecy or knew that the revelation of info could land them in prison for treason.My studies in WWII history and politics have given me enough broad information to know that for a fact the places he was stationed were some of the most secretive of the war. So while I can broadly say this or that lacking the details of his movements I just wont know. As a person he is highly honourable incredibly loyal rigid in his standards and law abiding in his life. He refuses to discuss the Japanese the Pacific theatre of war and dances around the topic of Americans in Brisbane during WWII which leads the thought that he may have only passed through and not been permanently stationed there. My Nan believed and told people that hed served in Papua New Guinea. That was something he never corrected her on while she was living.

7398907,0,t1_d2j3i4m,While I dont know much about ops original question I believe it is important to broaden the context in order to understand the Vaticans view of historical developments in Spain and Europe at the time. As stated by others the communists that were in Spain during the civil were mostly Soviet agents or influenced by the USSR and did not represent the bulk of republican supporters or forces. As a curious aside the international brigades included many British volunteers and there was even an American contingent called the Lincoln Battalion Ken Loachs Land and Freedom briefly touches on this.Now an couple of important points. Mexico was not a communist regime but as you rightly state a socialist democracy. In fact the Mexican revolution  was the first socialist revolution of the th Century and produced a socialist and anticlerical constitution  before even the rise of the Russian communists late . As a result the Church had lost influence in Mexico and the new government had outlawed any kind of political participation by any religious group in public affairs. Moreover they had also prohibited priests to vote and confiscated any land or property that the Church owned beyond actual churches. This came to a head in the littleknown Cristero War  in which Catholics rose up against the Mexican government many priests were killed and churches were closed. By the time the Spanish war broke out  years later I can only imagine the Vatican was still reeling from its losses in Mexico. This also partially explains the support the Mexican government provided to the republicans during the Spanish civil war.In a broader sense the Church as an institution had a very direct role in Colonial rule in Latin America and other parts of the world and also had a history of supporting more recent repressive antidemocratic regimes . In Mexico and Spain for instance the Church supported a dictatorship and a monarchy respectively. They openly supported Franco even though they were probably aware of all the atrocities carried out during and after the war. In short anticlericalism did not appear out of the blue. It had very clear historical roots which point to the Vaticans alliance with the powerful not with the poor. I am positive that they did not support the Nazis. However they werent completely innocent either at least not in the larger context of the history of Catholicism around the world. In the two or three decades leading up to WWII their support tacit or otherwise for oppressive regimes had started to backfire against the Church. As the top comment states they probably were in pure survival mode not just vis a vis the rise of Nazism but due to their own history coming home to roost.,history,d2j7gis,1,t5_2qh53

Usually youd be part of a caravan with security.  If you didnt have sufficient security you wouldnt have left with it in the first place.  If you got raided youd either kill the threat or lose the coin without a chance to bury it most likely.Maybe shit went south and everyone was getting dysentery and... I guess too many people were down to continue safety.  But what circumstances really make it safer to bury the money and just walk away?  I guess if you were sick and needed to go into an unscheduled town for weeks to recover someone would probably steal the loot while you recuperated.

7454011,0,t1_d2pbz1k,Ill add that a lot of mud seemed to slow things down when it rained or flooded. A typical days march on a good day was  miles on a great day  to  miles but would leave the men too exhausted to fight. On a bad day things would slow to a crawl in the mud and the effort to keep moving exhausted the men and one stuck in the mud wagon could halt an entire line. Check out the Mud March of January gtDuring the night of the th the rain began and by the morning of the st the earth was soaked and the river banks had the appearance of a quagmire. Already fifteen pontoons were on the river nearly spanning it and five more were amply sufficient. Burnside began at once to bring up his artillery which had the effect of making a perfect mortar bed. For a considerable area around the ford all day the men worked in the rain but to little purpose. Quite a number of cannon were advanced near the ford but the nd only added to the storm and the artillery caissons and even wagons were swamped in the mud.gtThe storm had delayed Burnsides movements giving Lee ample time to line the other shore with his army though there was no attempt to interfere with his crossing except from the sharpshooters who peppered away on all occasions. No doubt Lee was hoping Burnside would effect a crossing with a swollen river in his rear it would have been a sorry predicament for the Union Army indeed but Burnside finally became resigned to his fate and gave the order for the army to retire to its quarters and thus ended the famous mud march.,history,d2ph2a8,3,t5_2qh53

7457168,0,t3_4hgjy1,It depend who you ask about which aspect in what year.  It is safe to say that WWI left Europe in an untenable situation and that another war was imminent basically from the moment the Great War ended.  It is not really true to say that WWI caused WWII though.  For instance the US and the Pacific theater were involved for different reasons and the various conflicts arising from the destabilization of the British Empire were not a direct result of WWI.  WWI more or less guaranteed another European war and to the major players in Europe it must have seemed that it caused WWII but the second war was a much more truly global conflict as the same rapid advances and uncertainty that hit Europe in  was building in the rest of the world and the old Empirical orders were being overthrown or contested.  WWII was certainly a product of its times and WWI certainly contributed to that atmosphere but it is unfair to say that WWI was the cause of WWII.  However I think you could easily make the argument that WWI caused the rise of Nazism in Germany and if you can also argue that Hitler caused WWII difficult at best then you could argue that WWI caused WWII.  However I think it is likely WWI contributed to the timing and character of WWII.

7457653,0,t1_d2pvfci,Thats a pretty poor reply. When I say Japan did this to create an empire you shouldnt read that as literally there was no such thing as a Japanese Empire until they did this as that is an incredibly uncharitable interpretation that relies purely on semantics and doesnt advance the dialogue one bit. By that logic if you said that Hitler was trying to create an empire youd also be wrong even though thats a pretty good description of the events of the late searly s in Germany he did talk about creating a Third Reich which by your definition was already created but if it was already created than why would he be saying he was trying to create it?.When using empire in this context it doesnt refer to a particular type of governmental structure but rather to the scale of the empire. While Japan may have had an imperial governmental structure going back long before WWI or even the RussoJapanese war the Japanese Empire wasnt very empirelike. It didnt have large amounts of overseas colonies the acquisition of which is what Im talking about when I talk about them becoming an empire. What I was trying to get at was that Japan was trying to make itself an empire like that of the UK or France.If you have something substantive to contribute to the discussion here then please do but your comment amounted to you used a word differently than I do so youre wrong which is very unhelpful and poor form.,history,d2pvzk5,1,t5_2qh53

7484121,0,t3_4husof,The primary reason headgehogs were deployed to force any invasion to land at low tide.  Meaning a longer beach with more time to shoot them and consequently day light.      If that werent the primary concern?  The night would only cover the defenders the attackers need to come up the beach either way.  The Germans only had to sweep the beachhead with machine gun fire.  Light no light doesnt matter point toward water and shoot until you need to reload and repeat until there is nothing left to put into your gun.            So you have your hedgehogs tearing up the transports drowning the majority of your invasion force.  Or at least disarming them. Of those who make it to the beach you have them tripping over shit getting tangled up in barbwire and running in circles shooting eachother in a blind panic as the only things with which to orient themselves would be those loud flashy things which also happen to be the things killing them.

7500051,0,t1_d2tqd3j,I disagree. The Soviets had expected and planned to assist in fighting the Japanese after the war in Europe concluded. This was an established plan. Russia had already fought a war with Japan only a few decades earlier and the issues of that war were never truly resolved to anyones satisfaction. If anything America dropping the atomic bombs did as much of a favor to the Soviets as it did the American troops. Millions of men were being trained in the US to invade mainland Japan but millions were also being moved and trained in the USSR and the burden would have been shared. The goal of dropping the bombs was to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and end the war immediately. It also saved the lives of just as many Red Army soldiers. Does that make it right? Thats a debate that could go on forever but it was the motive nonetheless.Edit I neglected to mention plan totality which came at the end of the war and would have been a preemptive nuclear strike again cities in the USSR but that plan was nothing more than a bluff as the US did not have enough bombs to actually make it happen anyway and the Soviets did not believe it for a second.,history,d2uptu2,2,t5_2qh53

Not to mention by the end of the war the RAAF was the fourth largest air force in the world.

7501278,0,t1_d2us71u,Ok firstly you need to stop saying things like this is completely untrue etc simply because you were indoctrinated with history via propaganda  the purges of high ranking officers etc was disaster for the soviet army and denying that and saying it actually made the army better makes the rest of what you say appear fanciful by association  I was interested in what you were saying until I read this  instead of an alternative version of what actually happened I now feel you have just been taught propagandised version of history. Anyway that aside being caught with a badly preparedthought out plan is little different to being unpreparedcaught by surprise. it is accepted that the soviets had plans in place in the event of an invasion and were preparing for one. It is also accepted that when the attack came it caught them off guard. Just because you are expecting somebody to hit you at some point and have ideas for what you will do when they strike doesnt mean you know exactly when where and how they will hit and the Germans certainly achieved surprise in this area resulting in shock and mass confusion throughout much of the front  and the Soviet response was most certainly compounded by NOT improved by Stalins purges. Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. The soviet plan was badly thought out the soviet army was badly prepared and on a tactical level Soviet units were caught by surprise and overwhelmed all over the front soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground soviet counter attacks were poorly prepared uncoordinated and ineffectual ...

On the other hand preventing the Germans from regrouping and counterattacking in the first few hoursdays of the invasion was a great strategic goal in itself and it was fully accomplished. The invasion of such scale required all the usual army infrastructure hospitals fortifications warehouses docks etc. and it could only be delivered from the UK by sea or air. Time required to deliver it to the mainland and set it all up was measured in hours and days. Without the constant threat from the airborne troops the Germans could have easily gather local forces to counterattack right away while the Allied troops are still sitting ducks on the beaches or set up a solid defense line along the coast.It was even more important considering that the Allied reserves in UK were significant whereas the German reserves in Western Europe were already pretty scarce so the Allies needed to set up the longest front line possible to effectively exploit the numerical advantage in the later stages of invasion with limited initial forces. Holding the separate locations in the enemys territory turned out to be a winwin situation it both diverted the incoming German forces from the main front line and could be and was secured later by the main invasion forces without the need to assault it with the German garrisons inside.,history,d2ytm0q,3,t5_2qh53

Its a U.S.western saying which basically means If you dont ask for it you wont get it.  Stop being a wuss and speak up for what you want.The Japanese have a saying that they might use if a similar situation comes up  The nail that stands out gets pounded down.  In other words Need something?  Not happy?  Tough everyone has their problems.  Stop disturbing everyone else with your complaining.Given this desire for harmony within the group the Japanese are more likely to go along to get along.Consider the implications of the Stanford Prison Experiment and how ones personal warning signs can be suppressed when everyone else in your group is doing something you find a bit iffy and then add in the fact that your culture is extremely antiindividualist.  A strong cultural reluctance to speak out could easily speed the descent of the group into barbaric behavior.This may have been exacerbated by the thenpopular idea of Social Darwinism which left folks more likely to buy into the idea that the person with different skinhairteethdialect was actually subhuman.  Im not an expert on all of the motivations of the Japanese in WW.This is not to suggest that the Japanese are worse people than anyone else or that the American forces were perfect angels but there are cultural differences between groups of people which could lead to different behaviour and reactions by individuals.Subby should read The Chrysanthemum and the Sword by Ruth Benedict.  Its a foundational text in the area of cultural study of Japan. and she wrote it in the immediate aftermath of WW so this sort of question was very much on minds back then.Subby would also do well to look into research discussing bullying in modern Japan.

Helmets were good protection for infantry against cavalry borne enemy striking downwards on your head and also offered some protection against missiles.Move forward a bit towards the period of the  Years Wars and then into the Napoleonic period and the corresponding increase in the use of personal firearms on the battlefield and the need for helmets decreased. Simply put they just werent seen to be needed by the quartermasters who were by now responsible for kitting out soldiers in armies. Whilst it could be argued that they still had some use as protection against shrapnel the use of artillery ordinance was still fairly primitive with either ball canister or chain in use until the st World War. A helmet generally offered no protection against these especially for the average soldier standing in the line.Moving onto the modern era Crimean War and the Boer War and the use of helmets began to make a reappearance as warfare moved away from mass lines marching into battle. As you move forward the main reason I believe for the reintroduction of the helmet was a result of the use of timed fuses allowing a fired shell to explode above an area instead of when it hits the ground and of course in the increased use of purpose built shrapnel shells in the by now rifled artillery that had a longer range and could be situated out of site of the combatants on the field.This in turn led to the use of trenching to counter the impact of the improved technology and further enforced the need for some form of head protection for infantry.,history,d30ueid,1,t5_2qh53

But the precedence of the ranks of a Baronet or a Knight is quite generally accepted for where this distinction exists for most nations.However at least for the British system there is a clear distinction that a knight is not necessarily a noble. gt Baronet is a hereditary title ranking below Baron but above Knight this title is granted only in the British Isles and does not confer nobility.If a higher rank does not confer nobility in this system then a knight surly does not.

If your opponent had a sword or mace the flail would wrap itself around it and knock it from their grasp. If you missed at all the chain would wrap around and ensure a hit. It could even get behind a shield. I suspect that flails were indeed rarer than most other weapons. Not the choice of most soldiers for front line combat.

7666475,0,t1_d3dax4i,gtSo Mexicos super long and very intense wave has gotta be blamed on drugs and the general downward trend of their nation right?Mexicos economy and in various other metrics has been trending upward for most of the th century. So I think that saying that country has been on a downward trend since the s is a simplistic statement. Its been generally trending upward in the quality of life index. Perhaps not as quick as some have hoped but it hasnt gotten measurably worse for most of its citizens and in gdp and life expectancy its risen significantly.The drug war did impact the murder rate starting in  but before that the trend was downward.But curiously the drug war did had not led to increased illegal immigration to the US since then illegal immigration actually decreased and leveled off. Probably has more to do with the American economic recession but clearly the drug did not lead to more illegal immigrants despite it being centered on the border.Or if it did the number of people moving back to Mexico because of the economic conditions in the US outnumbered those running from the violence in Juarez Tijuana and etc.So...I think we need to come with another internal narrative on Mexico.I think its more due to proximity and demographics Mexico had its own baby boom generation. Those born between  and  and they came of age right during the collapse of Oil prices which Mexicos economy depended heavily on.Which caused the peso to collapse which led to a recession inflation unemployment like the one we experienced in .Meanwhile Americas economy was more robust and was looking for laborers. Once the s hit NAFTA went into play which further devastated Mexican farmers and factory workers alike. Since American goods could come into the country without tariffs.Which again led to another Peso collapse in .Meanwhile thanks to laxer mortgage policies the construction boom in America started to kick off like never before. Eagerly drawing and absorbing as much unskilled labor as possible.Then with the large scale amnesty in  and the subsequent heavier policing of the border it meant that more and more Mexicans decided it as just better to stay and build a life here.,history,d3dmuio,1,t5_2qh53

7728324,0,t3_4l2kdz,So the unification of Germany is a long and expansive topic. Many of the replies have hit up on the right ideas as to why it was able to happen under Bismarck but not why it didnt happen before him.King Frederick William IV the older brother of the first German Emperor was offered the emperor title  years earlier and turned it down. Ultimately he turned down the offer because the Austrians Russians and French would never have agreed to it. Before the German Empire there existed the German Confederation a loose confederation of German States with no executive branch which replaced the Holy Roman Empire. The State was supposed to safeguard the territorial integrity of the German States. However it was slow in reacting and could falter from pressure applied to individual states. The first Schleswig war went in Denmarks favor because foreign powers notably Russia and Great Britain demanded Prussia withdraw from the conflict. Its kind of telling that a small nation like Denmark was able to carve out territory from the German Confederation and still win.So the main factors I would say lead to the German unification under Prussia were as follows. German Customs Union established in  which included all the German States notably excluding Austria. This led to growth across the German territories and greater economic cohesion.. Prussias military gave it a stronger hand in negotiations. The German Confederation and Austria declared war on Prussia in order for Prussia to give up the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein. This war was concluded in  weeks.. Bismarck was a master in politics both domestically and abroad. He didnt create the wars that led to German unification but he did use them to his advantage. During the AustroPrussian war he convinced the French that Prussia might consider letting them have Luxembourg but this allowed Bismarck to quickly make peace with Austria before having to fight a larger conflict against all the European powers or agree to any real concession to France.. The creation of the civil law and German Civil law which simplified law making and the basis of ruling the country.I would say the main reason Germany didnt unify sooner was because on the one hand there was no unopposed hegemonic power in Germany and that foreign influence had always been a thorn in the side of progress towards unification.Frederick the Great a century earlier fought three wars over a piece of Austrian territory that ultimately attracted all the other major powers. France had always viewed Germany as their backyard and Russia wasnt keen on having a United Germany on its western Front.,history,d3knmfc,4,t5_2qh53

Moving armies hundreds or thousands of kilometers takes MUCH time then. Even if it was to just bring reinforcementsmaterial to the front line everything had to be planned in advance. The german army planned with the winter but not enough with autumn in the marches. At the same time the russians were losing ground and oddly enough that shortened the distance for their supply lines. When winter came march land froze and was passable again for heavier equipment which the russians had now at hand much faster.The fate of the german army at stalingrad was sealed even without splitting the army which was necessary the southern part should secure Baku to supply the army with much needed fuel.

But my personal favorite is the Paraguayan war  to . Paraguay declared war on the triple alliance made up of Argentina Brazil and Uruguay. Paraguays leader at the time was a maniac. The reason I believe this was the biggest blunder in military history is for the sheer fact of what it did to the population in Paraguay. They lost between  of their total population and over  of their total male population. They came out of the war with only  males over  left in the country. The number has always blown me away.

I dont know when this German soldiers called us stormtroopers thing started but stormtroopers were German.  It wasnt a cool nickname signifying your skill in battle it was simply an attack formation a new strategy in trench warfare.  Were there Canadian stormtroopers?  Absosultely.  It was a tactic adopted by many of the nations. Secondly Germans were quite scared of Canadians. Like cmon man.  Its a war.  If youre fighting a nation that is as trained and equipped as you youre going to have a healthy fear.  German High Command had to make a choice of either defending Caen or Cherbourg and they decided on Caen as it controlled the entire province so they focused the cream of their divisions in and around Caen. Which happened to be British and Canadian objective. It had nothing to do with being scared of Canadian or British soldiers.  Im not putting you on blast specifically but I hope others read this because I read this kind of stuff all the time.  Be proud if you wish but be proud about it rationally.

7878798,0,t1_d41m639,Well Id contend itd be the more reasonable assumption than that they did make direct contact. We have no written records that Im aware of at least detailing direct preColumbian contact between any New World societies and those of China or Japan else the findings of this article would be rather pointless.Take for example the archaeological finds at Helgo Sweden. In addition to typical raiding loot like a priests staff from Ireland a notable find was that of a Buddha statue determined to be originally from Northern India. Would this suggest that there was direct contact between Northern Indian societies and the various SwedishGeatish tribes of Scandinavia? Not necessarily and the various Norse accounts indicated that the farthest any Norseman went was the near east and some of the deeper forests of Russia. More likely the item was traded between numerous intermediaries before it was either purchased or pillaged closer to home by a Norseman. Likewise Roman coinage found in Iceland does not necessarily indicate direct contact between the Romans and the Icelandic people which would have likely been impossible given that there were no people in Iceland during the height of the empire and that colonization of the area by Celtic and then Germanic settlers began long after Roman authority had been confined to Greece and Anatolia.It is not inconceivable however that some of the Alaskan peoples traded with the Chinese in the postColumbian era however. The Tlingit were famous for using th century Chinese coins and weaving it together with cord and wood to create impressive sets of body armor that were allegedly capable of stopping Russian bullets during the Russian colonization of Alaska. Whether these coins were gained directly from Asian traders or if they were traded through intermediaries like the Yupik an InuitSiberian collection of peoples who live on both sides of the Bering strait is something Im not certain of.,history,d41neow,10,t5_2qh53

7898497,0,t3_4nh5br,gtSo where did the aspects of European armies such as drummers flagbearers marching bands and the flamboyant uniforms come from?  I was wondered what the demands of military science were that caused these changes as the style of European armies had changed almost dramatically considering how we had Medieval armies that had mail plate even leather and were armed from head to toe which was practical for a time.  fast forward to the s and even early s we see much of that being phased out especially the whole being armored head to toe aspect.  The Thirty Years War was considered to be a military revolution but not in terms of arms considering this phasing out of medieval arms began during the renaissance but a revolution of tactics and organization.  But we would see an early form of s era armies as gunpowder was beginning to be much more heavily relied upon and it was also during the Thirty Years War that the Spanish Tercio was defeated and began to be phased out as well.  The age of pikemen was beginning to end.  So again what caused this military evolution? Firearms. They made armour irelevant as the additional weight and limitation in movement offered by heavy armour provided little extra defence against bullets. The flamboyant colours banners and bands also came as a result of early gunpowder. Until smokeless gunpowder was invented battlefields quickly became consumed in smoke. Bright uniforms allowed troops to distinguish friend from foe in this chaos. Fire arms at this point were only effective in mass formations so being spotted by the enemy was less of an issue until rifles and sniping came into use as it was impossible to aim accurately. ,history,d43v59e,7,t5_2qh53

In fact many consider the victory in Plassey which handed over control of Bengal to EIC was the very factor that led to the TipuFrench combine that had been engaged in multiple wars with Britain in Southern India to be defeated. To give you an idea of how fertile Bengal is today our primary occupation is still agriculture and we have the densest population in the whole country. Our people are still only a bit poorer than more industrialised states and far more richer than agriculture dependent states with half the population density. There are areas that have  harvests annually all food cropsAnd peas or something in the middle to replenish nitrogen. We have large deposits of silt brought by a plethora of rivers.

It is not as big or flashy as  million but we are still talking about entire communities of people being wiped out.Absolutely. Stalin and the Soviet Union had unfinished business with Poland after their first attempt at annexing it in the s and the people they massacred here were a critical part of the countrys national identity.gtJust to make absolutely clear I am no holocaust denier. I am fully aware of what occured and have no qualms about acknowledging how the Nazis brutally killed millions of people simply because they saw them as subhuman. My point is simply that a large number of people being killed by a country should not be glanced over or treated as if it is unimportant simply because there is a bigger atrocity present in the same time span.Agreed. I probably came across as quite confrontational here because others in this topic really appeared to be treating this as a bit of a wedge issue to cast doubt on the occurrence of Holocaust and the Third Reichs crimes. A few people made statements claiming that they would have preferred to be a victim of the Nazis rather than British or Soviets and others pointedly stated that they believed the Allied powers to be the worse parties in the conflict.And I consider that an affront to my knowledge of history.,history,d48657n,2,t5_2qh53

7942245,0,t1_d48obnv,The ones Im referring to in Vietnam the Montagnard Yard tribe were a very poor mountain people. They didnt require much at all and money didnt really do them much good. The US paid them more with physical goods like lb bags of rice than cash. I believe they were loyal to the French back when the area was still French IndoChina and they became natural allies of the US attempting to halt the tide of Communism when the French pulled out. Since the US left I wouldnt be surprised if the tribe has been wiped out by the government. It isnt like they had technology beyond the guns given to them no radios or satellite phones so it would be difficult to say for sure. Edit from the Degar Montagnard Wikipedia page In  thousands of Degar fled to Cambodia after the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese Army fearing that the new government would launch reprisals against them because they had aided the U.S. Army... In addition the Vietnamese government has steadily displaced thousands of villagers from Vietnams central highlands to use the fertile land for coffee plantations.So no genocide no crazy massacres of tens of thousands. A few back during the war numbering in the hundreds but nothing culture ending. End edit. Modern day US affiliated mercenaries like the kind employed in Iraq tend to be ex military and ex police. It isnt like theyre up for hire to the highest bidder  these men and women tend to be patriots who realize that with a military contracting company they can make twice the money they did in the army and in half the time. After all why spend  years in Iraq for  when you could spend  years for ?

8027117,0,t1_d4iaevs,Just so you know Im enjoying this conversation quite a bit! If anything its a good side attraction from what Im doing currently at work.Everything youre saying about the Writing I can agree there. This would be the fault of the Season thus far and of the Writers. The episode itself however I think is a great standalone in accepting that theres some backstory that was neglected but can still be believable as having already been there subtlety. There are drops and hints at the Bolton forces and Bolton loyalists. Though the Writers did a terrible job at displaying the whole North Remembers bit perhaps the North is fairly geriatric and suffering from a bad case of Alzheimers and an identity crisis. There are the drop backs to showing the insurrection surrounding the Red Wedding the betrayal of Littlejon against his father Greatjon.The Karstarks despise their Cousins due to Robbs actions and Ramsay literally rules with an iron fist. I feel that what is left unexplained though I didnt feel it warranted much of an explanation was that the whole battle played into Ramsays plans. The Karstarks probably were not aware that they were going to be used in the plan I believe that Ramsay is sick enough to hide this from them  that they were going to be used as fodder entirely. The Umbers cared more about defeating the Wildlings than they did about fighting for the North.Littlejon seemed to dislike Karstark and Ramsay so even if he was aware of this he probably would not have cared about it. In any event I believe Ramsay shared his plans equally across his various Bannermensupporters  but neglected to include the part where hed be ordering his archers to fire on Karstarks or rather that the KarstarksBoltonsUmbers didnt expect to actually be met full on like they were by the Stark Cavalry. I like to think back to when Umber refused to kneel for Ramsay and seemed to retort back toward Karstark as unimportant to him.Also we have some proof given anyway that the Boltons core army is strong. They took out Stannis army effortlessly and they more than likely are the same troops that served under Robb before the insurrectionred wedding. Theyre definitely veteran by now and a proven force to reckon. I feel that it is known that Ramsay killed his father but theres no point to rebel against him  they serve the Bolton family and Ramsay is now the Bolton family.Sorry if this one is a bit broken up compared to my other replies sort of had to go back and forth between real life and replying!!,history,d4ibncb,2,t5_2qh53

The gunners would apply their gasmasks to deal with the poison gas usually phosgene and then theyd get hit with the KSK causing them to clog their gasmask with vomit bit British Public School Prank flavour that. So the gunners would have to clear their gasmasks while holding their breath against phosgene. Eventually whenever they got hit with gas shells German gunners just left their guns.

I mean you can actually visit the Kong family tomb and family mansion  its a popular tourist spot. The estimates tend to start with Emperor Jimmu and Confucius and not at the mythical deities that they claim descent from.Jimmus existence is much less clear since its claimed that he was the greatgrandson of a deity but if he existed then it would put him at  years or so. On the other hand Sujin is the earliest Japanese emperor that scholars consider to be possibly real dating to around BC. So its a pretty broad range one could say anywhere between  to  years for the Japanese imperial family.Fun fact the current descendant of Confucius holds one of the very few hereditary political offices that persist in postdynastic China i.e. the Republic of China often called Taiwan.,history,d4k4d7g,6,t5_2qh53

8103680,0,t1_d4qum0e,Its due to sociopoltical dynamics in the Horn as widespread linguistic assimilation is almost always imposed upon conquered peoples by the more dominant groups in the region. A good example would be the Oromo migrations of the th centuries CE where a small handful of pagan Oromo nomadic warriors overran all of central and southern Ethiopia and north into Eritrea assimilating not only large groups of Semitic and Cushitic peoples but also nonAfroasiatic populations making no difference between both Christian farmers and Muslim pastoralists with entire ethnic groups coming to be regarded sections or clans of Oromos. Thus a small group of Oromo nomadic warriors induced a not only a massive linguistic shift but a equally massive identity shift for a hugely diverse plethora of peoples wherein they all began to identity as Oromo as oppose to Christian Amhara or Muslim Hadiya or pagan Dassanech. Most Oromos today are descendants of assimlated peoples although most are unaware of their actual origins and they are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia today. However later on as the Amhara became more dominant again they began assimilating in the reverse as such you have Oromo people like Haile Selaisse whose family were considerd Amhara despite being of known Oromo descent.The Amhara Christians also practice largescale assimilation against Cushitic peoples and in fact the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selaisse wanted widescale and swift assimilation of the Somali nomads in the Ogaden Somali region of Ethiopia although the attempt failed and their accultration into Amharic Christian society. The Amhara also have used wholesale ethnic assimilation as a preventative means for quelling revolt and division from Cushitic peoples and as such you can see Afar clans become Christianzed and Amharic speaking or the large scale assimilation of Agew and Beja Cushitic speakers into Ethiosemitic languages like the Tigrespeaking Beja Beni Amer tribe. In regards to Somalis ethnic assimilation  is not allowed where nonSomalis come to identify as Somalis as the Somali ethnicity itself is strictly clanbased and only paternal lineage determines whether one can be considerd Somali. Thus one can only be ethnic Somali if they have direct paternal lineal descent from one of the  Somali clans whose clan founders in turn all trace descent to Samaale the namesake and patriach of the Somali people and nation. But although ethnic assimilation is forbidden and not practiced by Somali society linguistic and cultural assimilation is. A good example would be the assimilation Arab Turkish Persian and other nonSomali populatuons and clans in Somalia who have been Somalispeaking for almost  years and have developed a heavily PersianedArabic and Turkish infuenced Somali dialect called Benadiri. Similarly Ethiopian slaves from the Adal invasion were also linguistically and culturally assimilated and formed theor own clans and are still considerd distinct and nonSomali and formed a Somali dialect called maay with a heavy substrate influence from Ethiopian languages. Same for the Bantu slaves who were brought from southeast Africa due to the slave trade who number  million and all whom speak and formed their own Somali dialect influences by Bantu languages yet are not considerd Somali. The Khoesan hunter gatherers have also been linguistically and culturally assimilated and have their own dialect as well as enslaved Masai and other Nilotic peoples who were linguistically and culturally assimilated as well. All these groups have clearcut ethnic identities and are not considerd Somali yet all speak Somali and have developed their own dialects and are culturally and religiously almost indistinguishable. As such I believe the same thing would be at play in Ethiopia as even in the present and historically Somali is and has been seen as one of two dominant languages vying with Amharic. In our case here since Ahmed Gragn began sending Somali settlers into Christian Ethiopia and as Somali soldiers began sending for their wives and children from the Somali desert to live in the Ethiopian highlands and also due to the widespread and quick conversion of most Christian Ethiopians to Islam during the Somali occupation and how Somali soldiers and Ahmed Gragn himself began giving organized Quranic instruction to the Christian Ethiopian highland children I can only predict that the linguistic shift would happen rather quick although it likely would be patchy and vary greatly due to the remote and mountainous makeup of most of the Ethiopian highlands.,history,d4qxdaw,1,t5_2qh53

8204574,0,t3_4roet5,A few things to consider here some Pacific Islanders believed in destroying personal belongings after their owner was dead. there were huge technological advancements in the Americas and in the pacifictons of places and artifacts in the Americas were destroyed by Europeans Mostly though the history of technology and science are based on perception. History is less about the actual events and more about the perspective of the author and the current audience. War is important in todays society and thus the invention of gun powder is important in history. It is so important that its often used as a defense of teaching Chinese history to kids and they accept it when theyd otherwise complain that Chinese history was irrelevant. We as a society mostly feel that astronomy is something cool but ultimately doesnt make a difference in our lives. Because of this the Egyptian Pyramids and Chichen Itza are fun facts at the bottom of high school history text books if theyre talked about at all.

In this battle the th Guru and his two eldest sons were there. When they used up all their ammo groups of  sikhs would ride out to take on the mughal army both of the sons died in the battle.The Chali Mukte the forty liberated ones they abandoned the guru at the battle of anandpur and then were shamed by the women at home in particular Mai Bhago who then led them to battle after chamkaur when the guru was being hunted by the mughals all forty died from wounds after the battle and were blessed by the guru. Mai Bhago survived and become the gurus bodyguard.Baba Deep Singh at the age of  led a peasant army to liberate the Harmandir Sahib he suffered a blow to the neck but continued fighting with a two handed khanda sword until he made it to the temple complex where he died.Fast forward a few decades the Sikhs took on  invasions by the Afghan King Abdali Shah. Abdali would march into Mughal lands and loot cities and villages taking slaves on the way back through Punjab the Sikhs would constantly harass and raid his army taking back loot and freeing enslaved women. This pissed him off so he kept invading and destroyed the one the holiest temples in sikhism The Harmandir Sahib later known as the Golden Temple. Not only did Abdali destroy Sikh Temples but he also persecuted and massacred Sikhs where ever he found them in his later campaigns he was not successful and was constantly harassed in Guerrilla warfare.Under Hari Singh Nalwa the sikhs counter invaded and conquered large parts of Afghanistan.Just read the story of Akali Phoola Singh he was a beast in battle.During the AngloSikh Wars the sikhs distinguished themselves against the British in fact the were considered the superior force and by rights should have won the first war if not for court politics and betrayals getting in the war.A final battle to look into would be Saranghari  sikhs were besieged by  afghans and fought to the last man.Edit added Hari Singh Nalwa Baba Deep Singh and Chali Mukte,history,d59h609,7,t5_2qh53

Was it really as simple as a shot in the dark business gamble of hoping for a great trade route?In short yes. At the time China was by far the most wealthy country in the world historical estimates vary but its very possible that Chinas GDP in  was roughly equal to all of Europe. All the goods that European traders and merchants most desired porcelain spices silk etc. came from the far east. Previously these goods were available via the Silk Road under Mongol hegemony the trade routes across Asia flowed quickly and freely. However with the breakdown of the Mongol khanates the political system that preserved this flow of trade disintegrated. The next hegemonic power to emerge the Ottoman Empire was traditionally hostile to most of the Western European states and for the most part did business only with Genoa and Venice. So for states like Castile Portugal and England their access to the enormously lucrative Chinese market was completely cut off. This was the impetus for the exploration around the Cape of Africa and across the Atlantic.,history,d5dmhzt,5,t5_2qh53

8318971,0,t1_d5heyx5,It seems kind of a waste of potential for the British to not field their cavalry units or light infantry with rifled bored guns especially since their objectives were not to engage an army muzzle to muzzle in volley fire formations. I understand that the long rifles were more expensive to make and hard to load Ive loaded and fired them. The guns also require greater cleaning care however I have witnessed the firing of a converted US model  flintlock musket from a smoothbore gun to a rifled gun.  Shot with a  caliber musket ball the range was increased from  to .  At twice the distance a military grade rifled flintlock musket is worth its purpose on the battlefield even in smaller numbers.

8344836,0,t1_d5k37zq,Alexanders massive campaign from Greece to the Indus took a massive amount of preparation too though. Alexander didnt just grab a Macedonian army and rampage across Persia from the getgo. It was the result of years of consolidation by his father Philip II and playing off the Greek citystates against one another diplomatically in order to weaken them enough to establish Macedonian hegemony in the League of Corinth. Culminating in the Battle of Charonea Phillip managed to solidify the rest of Greeces support in a future invasion of Persia without inflicting punitive measures except for Thebes that would cause them to hate him and not offer him their allegiance.Macedonia went from a second rate kingdom in the north of Greece to dominating the Hellenic world. The fact that Macedon had superior troops in the new Macedonian phalanx developed by Phillip is a testament to the states own ingenuity and should not be counted against them. With this they not only crushed the Asian armies but also the traditional hoplite phalanx utilized by the Greek citystates to the south. This was a revolutionary formation and no one had really seen it before both in Greece and Asia. Besides conquering the entire Persian empire and more starting with just  men by foot is no small feat in any sense.The legacy of Alexanders campaigns cant really be overstated either. The conquests saw the decline of the polis and the rise of large autocratic empires. It saw Greek dominance across the Eastern Mediterranean where the language became the lingua franca. Hellenistic kingdoms dominated the Mediterranean until the rise of Rome which was also heavily influenced by Greek culture. This legacy continued through the Middle Ages in the Greekspeaking Byzantine Empire. Not to mention the cultural syncretism in the east with the GrecoBactrian Kingdom and the IndoGreek Kingdom . Not that the HanXiongnu campaign was any less impressive but Alexanders campaign was also marked by careful preparation and such a large campaign undertaken by so small a state in  B.C. should really account for much.,history,d5knpml,8,t5_2qh53

The American military brass seemed to be divided on the need and some even cast serious doubt as to the truthfulness of the justification for dropping the bombs... But Im not well versed enough to really explain the complicated nuances.I dont know the ins and the outs of the Japanese wartime government to understand the situation from their end  Like did Hirohito have the power to speak for the government?

8537223,0,t1_d68hrs5,I think I can contribute here.  The Arms of Krupp is an entire family history but the point of the book is to indict the last Krupp for slave labor war crimes which William Manchester did.  In fact Krupp was by far the most enthusiastic consumer of slave labor and it was not conscripted labor or immigrant labor which Krupp long had familiarity with. Alfried Krupp himself was one of the first Billionaires.  He made his money on slave labor all over Europe.  Krupp had specific factories built at Auschwitz I and Birkenow among many other Concentration Camps.  The Germaniawerft Naval Factory used slave labor that eventually indicted Doenitz and led to his execution.  Alfried Krupp himself escaped prison time although he did agree to pay compensation to Jewish slave laborers probably because there were so few left but thats my hypothesis.  He did not compensate the millions of slave laborers who worked for Krupp from Slavic Roma Western Europe Polish lands.  The overall indictment of Krupp was not enough to put Alfried in prison because of the German Miracle and the necessity of the Cold War under Adenauer.  But it was one of the factors that led to the end of Krupp in Germany and their special status.  The slave labor of Krupp representative of IG Farben Thyssen Rheinmetall and other big German firms is completely representative of the special nature of the slave labor.  It was a war crime they worked the slaves to death they rebuilt collapsed sheds factories on a nightly basis during the height of the assault on the Ruhr and other locations throughout the Reich.  They maintained production through sheer abject brutality and lethal working conditions.  Worked hundreds of thousands of people to death.  Slave labor.  Period no question welldocumented accepted historical fact.  In counterpoint Krupp during previous wars WWI as an example used at first immigrant then what you call Conscripted labor.  Krupp itself not under Alfried at this time was a pioneer of Philanthropic Industrialism.  So the Ruhr had Polish and other Slavic and Balkan labor immigrants.  He built houses hospitals schools and brought in nutritious food.  The work was hard but they were paid and their families cared for.  When war shortages began in WWI Krupp workers got food when others didnt.  Forced labor was brought in but part of the issues was existing German labor unrest under increasing war deprivations food money any type of consumer good.  Krupp kept his workers going by having special privileges.  As opposed to WWII where slaves were selected from the line to the gas chambers literally at Aushwitz and put on reverse trains back to the Ruhr or other Krupp industrial centers the old Skoda works mines and processing plants in Northern FranceBelgium Naval Factories the old Cruesot etc.  Krupp had a factory at Auschwitz as did other industrial concerns.  There the people would be given starvation rations.  If they did not work they were shot.  Krupp paid off the responsibility to the SS and another special Industrial Unit I forgot what whose job it was to coerce slaves to labor.  Barracks did revolt and there was unrest... and there were mass executions because of it.  There are many instances of massacares at German Industrial plants which the Barons and the German government sought to dispose of the records to because of the importance of German industry in the Cold War.  This is an extensively researched subject with no remaining ambiguity.  Nazi guards were executed.  The guards at the factories committing atrocities on the workshop floor.  Thats because they were driving slaves.,history,d68px2h,15,t5_2qh53

Also dont forget that the US was in a naval war with France prior to Napoleon so they have experience fighting both British and French navies.Britain couldnt defeat the US with domination of the seas and the ability to transfer and supply a large force this is because the US was on the defensive.  There isnt even room for an argument there was no way the French were going to get an Army over to the US to even equal the US army let alone supply it all while fighting on enemy territory.  Not when they dont have much of a navy anyway and they are much too worried about Austria Prussia Spain Russia and Britain to even start devoting resources which would then take decades to build up a proper fleet.edit  The main reason Revolutionary and Napoleonic France did so well was because they didnt start the war so in the minds of the masses they were defending their homeland.  To think the French people would be all for building a new colonial empire when the Ancien Regimes failure to do so was one of the main buildups to the Revolution is ludicrous.gt think the British would have been only interested if Napoleon threatened Canada.Then you honestly dont understand the foreign policy of Britain at the time.

The sudden decline in population would do much the same in America as the Bubonic plague did in Europe allow more land to be inherited by fewer descendants and reduce pressure of rural populations to migrate to the city.Meanwhile in the city food would become more expensive due to fewer surviving producers the higher population density of the city would lead to higher infection rates than in the country and ability to maintain infrastructure intended to support the now declining city population would be overwhelmed.A few rounds of contagious diseases with reasonably high infection and fatality rates and a city could be reduced to a largely deserted derelict.And that isnt even taking into account the cost of caring for the infected or the reduced productivity and fertility of surviors crippled by European diseases like polio or mumps.Edit my timeline was wrong.

I said in my second sentence that their reasons for conquering i.e. land and resources were probably not all that different from Napoleon most conquerors werent exactly selfless people and yet theyre generally accepted as heroes. Both men are complex historical figures but since they date back to antiquity theyre easier to celebrate. It also probably helps that theyre seen as symbols of western civilization making it easy for our modern society to identify with them. While Napoleon was a western leader he was an enemy of many nations that are still around today leading him to be a much more polarizing figure.,history,d6osom9,1,t5_2qh53

8701372,0,t1_d6t9qf2,Ive read Stalins Daughter a biography made by the granddaughter of Stalin and the journalist Sullivan. Although the focus of the book is obviously on Stalins daughter it also includes some snippets about his sons.  From what I remember Vasily managed to keep getting preferential treatments because despite Josephs request no one dared to go against a Stalin. Vasily met reality when he joined the airforce at the start of WW and complained to his father about the shitty rations and uniforms which Joseph replied with something along the lines of The Red Army rations are good enough for everybody.    He seemed alright at first for so much you can be that when your father runs the country like a demigod. It seems however that he quickly learned the might he could wield simply by mentioning his last name. That ended up fucking him up royally  when his father died Vasily was reassigned to a district outside of Moscow. He refused attempting to do the whole do you know who I am and left the air force for it.

8714347,0,t3_4zbq1e,Id say actually the narrative has swung too far the other way painting the Soviet Union as some unstoppable juggernaut that would have singlehandedly destroyed Germany and says that the Western allies were fighting a bunch of year olds and strategic bombing had no effect whatsoever.You need to consider The US massively supplied to the Soviets several hundred thousand trucks alone that fed those large counterattacks Strategic bombing destroyed the Lutftwaffe allowing for those huge armored Soviet formations that would have been impossible with no air cover The Americans and Chinese kept the eastern front occupied and basically freed up the core Siberian troops and Marshal Zhukov to come rescue the Soviet European front Even though the statistic German wartime production rose by  is often cited as proof of the failure of strategic bombing anyone knowing anything about supply chain knows about the disruption quality of materiel and high cost and delays of having to import replacements from alternative sources plus you make more stuff you still have to ship it and it just gets bombed in the process. German industrial capacity after the war was nonexistent. Terror attacks by air did work not saying its right or wrong and also disrupted daily life of the average German citizen to the point they were using wood pulp to replace normal food. The Soviets did not destroy the German Army the German Army destroyed itself due to not being able to conduct strategic withdrawals. This was the same stupid tactic the Soviets used early on that led to their own high losses due to encirclements.If you want to know who the most forgotten defenders of the war are its the Chinese.  million of them died fighting the Japanese. That was a huge huge huge war that had been going on long before the Soviets or Americans started fighting Germany and is only treated with a couple of paragraphs in history books.,history,d6uxj0l,1,t5_2qh53

8836617,0,t3_515qb2,The main issue is with teaching you need to have a captiveparticipating audiencestudents but because students do not participate the class doesnt move forward at such a fast pace.  A lot of people remember this in college in your general courses a lot of people couldnt give a shit about the courseworkmaterials.  But once they made it into their majors they paid attention since it was what they were aiming towards in regards of a career.Then there is the time issue. In the US history classperiod is normally  to  hours depending on how the schools schedule is organized.  The podcast stretches over ish hours of material.  That means covering it in class would take ish hours due to discussion homework and questions.  If any student was sick or missed a class they would have to review quite a bit of notes.Then they would also need books that could provide a source material for homework and what not.  Books are harder because the type of book purchased is normally set by the state or some other entity like Texass mass buys.Its much like how WWII lessons discussed Normandy Pearl Harbor Atomic bombs and Nazis.  But gloss over the Pacific battle internment camps other continents etc.At a certain point its just too much to cover so they pick and choose so it works with what they are able to do in their allotted timeresources.,history,d7a1c8w,1,t5_2qh53

8842387,0,t3_519rvi,The Norwegian Rocket Incident. Probably the closest weve ever come to nuclear war. The Americans and Norwegians sent up a rocket to monitor the Aurora Borealis but the Russians due to a communication error believed it to be a nuclear strike. Boris Yeltsin was given the nuclear suitcase and was encouraged to strike back. For some reason he didnt. Its impact is only hypothetical but Yeltsin wasnt the greatest of leaders and hideously exposed the flaw in the Realist argument of Mutually Assured Destruction. Sometimes mistakes happen and nuclear weapons can end up in the wrong hands and I personally believe a lot of the modern Nuclear Disarmament movement has stemmed from this incident. The Cuban missile crisis was bought about from posturing superpowers while this was an accident that almost ended the world. I think that changed the mindset of a lot of people around the world who were aware of the incident. ,history,d7aq9q7,0,t5_2qh53

Their father might be absent as a prisoner of war fighting for the free french or sent to Germany as a forced laborer.  In Poland the population was treated much worse by the Germans. Under their policies Polish children should not get much education. The Germans kidnapped  Polish children they were evaluated and tested. The ones deemed Racially valuable were placed for adoption with German families with falsified papers giving them German instead of Polish origins or raised in SS Childrens Homes. The undesirables were sent to camps for forced labor and in some cases medical experiments.Im from the Netherlands my mother and my parents in law were children during the occupation.Some storiesMy mother was in a boarding school in The Hague during the war.At first things werent too bad although there was a blackout life went on and she didnt have anything to do with German soldiers.As the war progressed there was less and less of everything. Cars mostly disappeared from the streets and she would rollerskate through the city to go to secondary school.  One boy in her boarding school ad a German father he was called up for military service when he was . He was sent to the Eastern Front. They got a few postcards from him with preprinted texts and then a death notice.My uncle who was  was sent to Germany for forced labor in a German factory. The work wasnt too bad but the constant air raids were terrible. The school had no airraid shelter but everyone would go to the safest corridor when there was an airraid alarm. The Hague was bombed by Allied planes a couple of times. The Germans started launching V rockets at London and Antwerp from sites in the city. You could hear them start. If the motor stopped during the ascent which sometimes happened everybody would brace for impact because the rocket with  pounds of explosive would fall somewhere in the city. A house in the street where my mother lived got totally destroyed by a malfunctioning V.In late  and  the West of the Netherlands was cut off from  the rest of the country by the shifting front lines a railway strike and a German blockade leading to the Hunger Winter Famine My mother would go to a central kitchen where the children would be weighted and then receive a ration of thin soup. She had to eat sugar beet on occasion which she told me tasted really terrible. Other people ate tulip bulbs. They were hungry and cold all the time. When the liberation was close  flour was sent from Sweden through the Red Cross and suddenly white bread was available again my mother told me she never had eaten something so good.My mother in law was six in  and would go to school for the first time on May th. That day the Germans invaded and so there was no school and she was very pissed about that. She and my father in law lived on farms in a rural corner of the Netherlands. Sometimes German soldiers or Dutch collaborators would come looking for people in hiding. My father in law vaguely knew who was helping the resistance and who was collaborating with the Germans. He and his father would sometimes be forced to transport stuff with their horse teams for the Germans. One time they were zoomed by allied planes when doing this. My father in law was an excellent horse handler but in this case he let the horses run wild until the German load had landed in the ditch next to the road and then went home.They lived near the Ems estuary and could see how the city of Emden was bombed by allied bombers and burning afterward.As farmers they always had enough to eat. The Germans requisitioned a lot of food but most people hid enough to feed themselves or sell on the black market.In the last weeks of the war there was fighting around the farm where he lived. Weiwerd on the map in the article. Canadian troops tried to occupy the harbor town of Delfzijl nearby but it was tenaciously defended by the Germans who were using it to ferry retreating troops to Germany. My father in laws family lived in the potato cellar for weeks and the farm was hit by gunfire and artillery a couple of times. Fortunately nobody was wounded. One day during the fights a couple of young German soldiers came and asked for food they were nearly starved and my father in laws mother took pity on them and served them coffee. One or two days later the Canadians came and they were liberated.There isnt much hatred against the Germans in my family and family in law but it helps that noone was killed or imprisoned by them.,history,d7pz6cr,16,t5_2qh53

9062243,1,t1_d814vy4,Hi!   It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false winners write history trope! It is a very lazy and ultimately harmful way to introduce the concept of bias. There isnt really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic but much better than winners writing history is writers writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have lost the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within or at least sympathetic towards that order and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.Of course writers are a diverse set and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Im not saying the historical Russians have the moral high ground here but the comment I responded to made it sound like the old Russians were somehow much worse than the old Americans. But the outcome in terms of population is a lot better for Russia and the stans.And there is also the historical context of Russia being under the yoke of Mongols and Tatars for centuries until the rise of Moscow and MongolsTatars also butchered a huge amount of people. It was not a onesided conflict. Whereas European settlers in the Americas had obviously no business going there and take the land from the natives.

It seems to me that the only logical conclusion would have been to destroy communism before it had the chance to hold the world hostage with the bomb.Now I realize that things worked out and in the cold war we never destroyed each other. But we came so close. Reading about the Cuban missile crisis still sends shivers down my spine. The entire cold war could have been prevented if Britain and the US had immediately changed tactics and invaded the soviet union.I seriously doubt that in  the soviets would have been able to put up a formidable defense against the vast manufacturing power of the US combined with the Abomb. ,history,d81e60h,1,t5_2qh53

9074534,0,t3_54hw2q,Based on some research from Sherman Design and Development Lucky Legs II was an M produced by the Pullman Standard Car Company during the summer of . Pullman Standards Sherman production unlike other manufacturers is quite sketchy in that we do not know exact dates about when features were introduced and must make educated guesses based upon the other manufacturers introduction dates. Pullman Standard was broken up and divested by the US government in early  due to antitrust suits soon after they left the Sherman program.Pullman Standard produced  M from June to October of . Pullman Standard produced the smallest number of M out of all the manufacturers that did so and so they are quite rare to see many of them seem to have gone to the Pacific. As I dont have my copy of S DampD with me right now I just have the registration and serial ranges not broken down by month.EDIT here they areP.O.

T  MMonth|Number|SN|RN|||September | M||USA USA October | M||USA USA Since the turret of Lucky Legs II does not have a pistol port we can deduce that the tank was produced sometime after about June . In April  the Ordnance Department voted to eliminate the pistol port in the turret of the Sherman as it was weaker than the surrounding armor and posed a ballistic hazard. Design and casting of new  mm turrets without pistol ports and with a thickened right front cheek to eliminate the thin spot two alterations were made in the turret armor in this area to allow the turret traverse motor to operate properly began immediately and they began to be delivered to factories in late May and early June . The using arms were quite upset about the elimination of the pistol port and Ordnance voted to reinstate it in July . The no pistol port turrets were used up by the fall of  and a new turret with a pistol port and the thickened cheek armor plus a new ovalshaped hatch for the loader he did not have one previously began to be introduced in November  Pressed Steel Car Company was the first to use it.Since Pullman Standard Car Company was one of the Sherman manufacturers designated to be out of the program before the end of  they had no obligation to incorporate the new turret and finished up production using the no pistol port turretsA couple more things of note Lucky Legs II features the solid type of idler wheel introduced by government mandate in May . It was found that the lip of the spoked idler wheel could become damaged frequently and the spokes could become clogged and and interfere with the operation of the track. Most manufacturers switched to it in early  Since Lucky Legs II has a no pistol port turret the right front cheek armor is already included. The tank can also be seen to have the full suite of  thick appliqu armor plates on the hull sides. These were introduced in August  along with  armor plates and doors over the interior ammunition bins. This still did not reduce the incidence of ammunition fires as the rounds were not yet moved to the floor of the tank and encased in waterfilled jackets. Pullman Standard seems to have gotten a large portion of their  mm turrets from American Steel Foundries cast armor plant in East Chicago Indiana. Their casting mark was a large block C at first a fancy shape then simplified sometime in  in an octagon cast prominently on the rear bustle of the turret. A large portion of the new tanks the th received in March  were manufactured by Pullman and several can be seen to have this mark.,history,d82m1c2,18,t5_2qh53

9161934,0,t1_d8cdxp3,This is not the case at all. To be brief Jews were particularly disliked and considered other throughout the medieval period and in just about every society in which they lived. This was a result of their ability to loan money with interest in their case at very high rates known as usury. This gave them a particularly bad reputation. Further they werent able to swear oaths to feudal lords and as such tended to live exclusively in cities and thus work as artisans jewellers lawyers advisors bankers when banks came about whereas their gentile counterparts generally worked in agriculture. Again this meant Jews were wealthier better educated and in turn more disliked. It was in fact not until  that the Catholic Church ceased to be explicity antisemitic.,history,d8dcbyu,3,t5_2qh53

It doesnt say anything about them abandoning their way of life because it was too hard. And I did provide a link that shows otherwise. That link to rAskHistorians also contains like  sources at the bottom. They identify how it was quite the opposite  that captives would choose to stay with the natives because of how they were treated. If captives were choosing to stay Im sure the women were as well.

9204670,0,t1_d8iqz8g,This is news to me! Id like to learn more about this burial of bodies.I gotta agree with you in regards to Ancient Peoples. A lot of people keep forgetting that the concept of national borders can be considered relatively new. Most of humanity at one time was nomadic and either followed the great herds of animals they reared or chased across Asia and Europe.This has resulted in the famous findings of such peoples like the Tarim Basin Mummies in modern day China in the Xinjiang province! Or how in ancient times disparate groups of various ethnicity used to travel in bands across the plains in what we know as Russia now.People have forgotten their ancestral claims to the patterns of migration due to weather season food and even warfare. Even as cities grew and fell people who survived those falls moved somewhere else sometimes. Trade caravans meant trails of different ethnic mingling like the Silk Route and children being of mixed ancestry. Like how some Arab traders stayed and created families with local Chinese. If youre interested take a look at the traveler Ibn Battuta...makes Marco Polo look like a bloody weekend tourist.Theres so much people have forgotten and this is why I love learning history. It makes us more humble but it also shows how close we are to one another despite our modern nationalistic trappings or socialracialreligious groupings.,history,d8ire82,3,t5_2qh53

The soviet industrial capacity and the big amount of available troops halted the German advance and succeeded to make them retreat.So to answer your question  Maybe yes.The German were only about km away from Moscow so the warm clothes might helped them get as close as  km which gives the German artillery the perfect range to pound Moscow day and night if they had enough numbers of guns.And maybe no as the whole of operation Barbarossa was messy from the first day. A good plan was to make one invasion route instead of  like Hitler wanted. That way the Germans could have put more soldiers and tanks in the way of Moscow. ,history,d8u8mvi,6,t5_2qh53

My mom even told me not to ask him about it because he didnt like talking about it.I figured it was for a couple of possible reasons. One talking about it brought back memories of how he felt while was was happening. Then I heard somewhere else wartime documentary? how German Luftwaffe pilots had a strategy for taking down Allied bombers.They would come in from behind and aim for the tail gunners. Then they would shoot out the engines on the wings one by one until the bomber went down.Out of all the crew members on a bomber the one with the statistically lowest chance for survival was the tail gunner.

Josephus if we align with the canon wrote a full generation after Jesus died this along with diffusion means those around  or late s by  AD would had been the youngest ones to have seen the last of Jesus  who also by canon only worked for three years or so at the end of his life in a stretch from Galilee to Jerusalem  the interior of a small subjugated nation on the rim of the Roman world and even more and more bypassed by the other worlds of the time such as Parthia or South Arabia.For Tacitus to be writing  years later would mean those around  in that relatively far off land would had seen Jesus. Its a gap of three generations. Its absolutely enough time for something to emerge and with a passing knowledge of church history it was a turbulent wonky time.At most I am comfortable with saying that Christianity emerged around  AD in full and it was full of division and growth  Gnosticisms and other heresies  and as for Christ himself while absence of evidence is not wholly evidence of absence it would be great if something more concrete came up in the worlds heaviest dig site.Its not like we feel that Adam Eve Cain Abel Noah Ham Shem Abram Joseph David or Solomon existed either  if Jesus was in a wave of revisionism which is already slowly occurring  declared to be by the sound methods of logic and reason and rationality to not exist nothing would change anyway.,history,d99pjx3,1,t5_2qh53

9471401,0,t1_d9gk00o,Hi!   It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false winners write history trope! It is a very lazy and ultimately harmful way to introduce the concept of bias. There isnt really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic but much better than winners writing history is writers writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have lost the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within or at least sympathetic towards that order and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.Of course writers are a diverse set and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

9485024,0,t1_d9i5n4r,The problem was much deeper than just the lack of strong goverment.The fact that magnates and nobility had such great influence over the legislation allowed them to greatly limit the freedom of peasants and townspeople. In XIV century a free serf could freely move around the country work his own farm. In XVII their position deteriorated to something similar to Spartan helots  near slavery tied to their lords fields. This greatly separated the nobility from the nation. When Austra anexed southern Poland the peasants joined the invaders in killing and robbing the nobility. Similar scenes happend on Ukraine eastern Poland during cossacks uprisings and Russian invasion.In XVIII century when Poland neighbours were drafting hundreds of thousands of soldiers equiped by manufactures in big citites Poland was still a feudal economy with a few insanely rich nobles Janusz Radziwil controlled area larger than Netherlands and had over  thousand people working for him and a tiny outdated army.

Its much easier in masks today then it was back then. Communicating is still very difficult despite the improvements made in the masks over the years.

9543318,0,t3_5bkn2p,At Waterloo the defences of the farm at Hougoumont especially by LieutenantColonel James MacDonnell of the Coldstream Guards and of the farm at La Haye Sainte by Major George Baring where a few hundred soldiers of the Kings German Legion successfully held off thousands of French soldiers. Not singlehanded but both of these guys held their ground and their men for many crucial hours Baring stayed on his horse as an example to his men having ordered them to hide and work as snipers basically and I think they only yielded when they finally ran out of ammunition after repeated requests for more. From Wikipedia  referring to MacDonnell This attack led to one of the most famous skirmishes in the Battle of Waterloo  SousLieutenant Legros wielding an axe managed to break through the north gate. A desperate fight ensued between the invading French soldiers and the defending Guards. In a nearmiraculous attack Macdonell a small party of officers and Corporal James Graham fought through the melee to shut the gate trapping Legros and about  other soldiers of the st Legere inside. All of the French who entered apart from a young drummer boy were killed in a desperate handtohand fight.Re Baring He ordered the men to lie down to be a smaller target. He remained on horseback. Although hazardous this was essential to give a good example and maintain an overview of the battlefield. Soon the two French main columns came into view moving fast. One attacked the buildings while the other went for the orchard.They lost  men out of  all very hungover after discovering the farms wine cellar the night before and accounted for about  French deaths. ,history,d9petxp,64,t5_2qh53

It coincides with the collapse of the Bronze Age. It is the most oftencited candidate for the Troy of Homer and is believed to correspond to Wilusa known from Hittite sources dating to the period of roughly  BC.gtgtThese dates correspond closely to the mythical chronology of Greece as calculated by classical authors placing the construction of the walls of Troy by Poseidon Apollo and Aeacus at  BC and the sack of Troy by the Greeks at  BC. Troy VIIa appears to have been destroyed by a war perhaps the source of the legendary Trojan War and there are traces of a fire. ,history,d9qlswy,3,t5_2qh53

9641049,0,t1_da10q6w,Interesting point!I agree that believing in science doesnt necessarily make you irreligious my mistake if I explained it poorly. My point was that during the Enlightenment the church lost a lot of its traditional power. People were starting to expand their knowledge not based upon the traditional book but upon scientific results as scientific as you might call it back in those days. You do see that a lot of philosophers and scientists during those days were still heavily tied into religion Descartes in France Hobbes in England and Galileo in Italy for example all made gigantic contributions to science from a religious point of view. Heck some even argue that Newtons theory of gravity has a religious factor in the formula the G the fact that theres no substance able to carry gravity. Another interesting point is that according to Max Weber capitalism itself came from calvinism he wrote about it in the classic The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism.I do think modernity and the uprising of science is mostly to blame for the downfall of religion. Praying gave way to rational thinking. Although there is a particularly interesting trend in Europe. While were not that religious anymore the Europeans tend to be heavily spiritual. Especially in countries where traditional religion hits an alltime low here in the Netherlands we have for the first time in history more atheists than religious people spirituality is on the rise. People believe in a higher force just dont reckon that its a God. The question that rises is just how different are we? Arent we just naming our beliefs differently?What I meant with religion having a certain functionality following the steps of Emile Durkheim is that I believe that religion used to provide a certain base to people.

It roughly translates toAlone in the forest a red flower blooms well. Soon all too soon I am dead. Soon all too soon. Flying somewhere is a piece of lead to take from me my sorrows. It doesnt matter to me whether today or tomorrow. Over there in the valley three shovels are digging. Digging a cold grave for a soldier.

9750829,0,t3_5eqiva,The USSR victory of Nazi Germany had more to do with Germanys failures than Soviet military success. Some quick pointers. The Soviet war machine out produced the Nazi War machine. They could build and replace almost every better and faster.  However much of this has to do with the fact that Germanys resources were tied up fighting the other allies managing the holocaust and managing the great air war that devastated Germany manufacturing. This gave the Soviets Leverage of Nazi Germany.. The Soviet Union HAD to defeat Nazi Germany had they came to an armacist or short term peace settlement this would have been simply a pause in a perpetual conflict. Stalin and the rest of the communists knew that the security of the USSR depended on defeating Hitler in absolute. . Nazi Strategies in defeating the USSR had too many objectives to achieve in a short period of time. When the Moscow offensive stalled the Nazis decided to swing south to capture Baku and were forced into Stalingrad. The Germans were ill equipped to take on another objective After Moscow with a reinforced Soviet Army failure was immenent. What the Germans should have done after the failure of Moscow was consolidate their gains and begin a more defensive strategy until the time was right for another offensive. . The Nazi air force was neutralized in the USSR. What had afforded the Nazis so many early victories was their effective use of fighters and bombers.  On the Eastern Front Germany needed not only fighters but long range bombers to reach the Ural factories there was no long range Nazi bomber and this was never realized. ,history,daf0721,2,t5_2qh53

9852048,0,t1_darkcxv,It is somewhat curious that it was released at all during the war. At the start of WWI Britain lost the battleship HMS Audacious to a mine because their advantage over Germany in dreadnoughts was a relatively narrow  they successfully suppressed the news about Audacious sinking pretty amazing since a liner filled with American tourists was at the scene.In WWII Italian frogmen disabled HMS Valiant and HMS Queen Elizabeth for a number of months. Because of the critical role of these ships in maintaining a force advantage over the Italian navy the British successfully suppressed this news as well.So it is curious that they released any information about Barhams sinking. It may be the case that thanks to Ultra decrypts the British knew that the Germans already knew about the sinking. It was never really Britains policy to suppress negative war news in the interest of keeping up morale so the release of this footage is not surprising in that sense.Edit from wikigt In an effort to conceal the sinking from the Germans and to protect British morale the Board of Admiralty censored all news of Barhams sinking. After a delay of several weeks the War Office notified the next of kin but they added a special request for secrecy the notification letters included a warning not to discuss the loss of the ship with anyone but close relatives stating it was most essential that information of the event which led to the loss of your husbands life should not find its way to the enemy until such time as it is announced officially... Following repeated claims by German radio the Admiralty officially announced the loss on  January  ... it was not until the Admiraltys admission that Barham had been sunk and described the circumstances that von Tiesenhausen knew that he had sunk her.I dont really believe the protect British morale bit here  I dont think that was generally part of the British thought process as far as the release of negative news was concerned.,history,darqt74,5,t5_2qh53

9911811,0,t3_5h25fg,I would suggest this one  A spy among friends It is about the Cambridge Five who made their way up the ladder in MI  and MI  the British intelligence agencies while also being Soviet double agents. They were all recruited while being University students in the s at Oxford and Cambridge.They came from aristocratic families  and were very intelligent . They were devoted to the Communist cause and during WW they fed hundreds of Allied secrets to the Soviet military intelligence service.After the end of the war   of the  stayed in the Secret Intelligence Service and began their rise to the upper ranks of the SIS. Of all  of them  Kim Philby was by far the most capable. In the s he was the senior SIS agent in Washington where he was in daily contact with both the FBI and the CIA at the highest levels. He was able to send detailed information through his handler in Washington a Soviet consular officer in the Russian embassy.He was not suspected by SIS despite his alcoholic abuse constant adultery and erratic behaviour. He was considered to be simply a eccentric personality . His treason went undiscovered for over  years. Three of his fellow spies did a fade and got to Russia. They were considered to be Heroes of the Soviet Union  but in reality they were an embarrassment . They were quietly put out to pasture. Philby was the true star. Over the course of his career  as a double agent he sent hundreds of Allied agents to their deaths by informing the KGB about the time date and location of their attempt to infilatrate into Soviet territory. He also listed dozens of agents  that were working for the UK and the USA in many parts of the world.He was so damaging to Allied intelligence services like the CIA that they spent the next  years on a continual mole chase  that ruined many agents careers . JJ Angelton the head of CIA counter intelligence was completely fooled by Kim  Philby who he considered to be a personal friend. They used to meet every Friday at noon for lunch . Both wrote up their own notes  of what the other man had said. Many years later Angelton wiped all of that material  out of the CIA archives  to cover his own ass.Was Angelton also a Soviet spy  Nobody knows for sure  as he took his secrets  to the grave with him.The bombshell in the media   about the Cambridge Five had immeasurable and long lasting effects on the relations  between the British and American intelligence services. The Yanks were convinced there  were more moles in the SIS   and the Brits were keeping their fingers crossed that there were not  any more.Look for    A spy among friends    I rate it as the best post WW  real life spy book ever written. The author has the advantage of having  being given amazing access to SIS files and to  have been  allowed to do   interviews with some of the main players  who are still alive today.Jim b. ,history,dazj5vj,1,t5_2qh53

9960760,1,t1_db5wvc8,Hi!   It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false winners write history trope! It is a very lazy and ultimately harmful way to introduce the concept of bias. There isnt really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic but much better than winners writing history is writers writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have lost the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within or at least sympathetic towards that order and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.Of course writers are a diverse set and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

10142907,0,t1_dbtawi1,WWI and WWII are basically the same extended conflict with a reprieve in between and some of the allegiances changing. Churchill saw them this way being involved with both. WWII was borne in part out of poor resolutions to WWI shouldering Germany with unrealistic obligations to the rest of the world in punishment for the first world war. The horror and revulsion that followed WWI also played a role in the form of appeasement to the Axis powers many criticize appeasement years later as a form of weakness but it has to be understood in the context of WWI and a desire to avoid war again as much as possible even to a fault. People wanted to avoid another WWI as much as possible but ironically in doing so they probably accelerated an even worse phase of conflict. My point is just that WWII and its aftermath happened in large part because of WWI and its aftermath. The two are inextricably linked to the point of being part of the same thing and the answers to some of the questions you wonder about are already embedded in that extended world conflict. ,history,dbtmieq,8,t5_2qh53

Its viciously difficult to find sources that arent trying to sell something but I did find this BBC article on the history of men wearing wedding rings that suggests it wasnt at all common until WWII.  The sidebar contains these two tidbitsgtIn medieval Europe Christian wedding ceremony involved putting the ring on the brides index middle and fourth fingers in turn to represent the Holy TrinitygtThe ceremony in the Church of England Book of Common Prayer from  includes the words with this ring I thee wed  but involves only the presentation of a ring by the man to the woman.The article also talks about the rings possibly signifying ownership of the woman and links the modern ubiquity of male rings to the feminist movement of the s amp s and also jewelry for men becoming more common in that time frame.  Im certain that bit is cyclical.It might also be worth noting that there was a severalhundredyears gap between when the Church made marriage a sacrament and when it started requiring a church ceremony for everybody or it wasnt real.  Ive read here and there mostly on Reddit so take it for what its worth that marriage as we envision it today wasnt seen as a big deal by people or the Church for much of the Middle Ages.  So Id doubtbut could easily be wrongthat wedding rings were really a concern among the lower classes.  The aristocracy sure but Mary and Joe Farmer who didnt even have a legal ceremony?

10259188,0,t3_5mwi39,From my knowledge the Roman military was one of the first militaries to implement active command on the battlefield. To understand the Romans level of command you have to understand how a legion was organized to begin with multiple legions are within a province is controlled by the imperator Roman for commander in military context a Roman legion is  men controlled by a legatus the legatus has tribunes from the high and middle class to help advise him. These  men are broken into  cohorts this is where Rome really achieved its active on field strategy. Each average cohort this excludes only the first cohort as they were elite and larger and therefore organized differently was led by  centurions guy with the sideways mowhawk thing on his helmet with  men assigned to him. Centurions led the men on the battlefield when a centurion retreated his men retreated when a centurion called for to form a testudo they formed a testudo and so on. Following the centurion was the optio when  he was second in command of the men assigned to the centurion so when the centurion fell instead of retreating they followed the optio like they would the centurion. If you take one thing away from the rambling I did its that Roman commanders were by no doubt powerful but their power came from giving power to people in lower rankings. The true success of the Roman military is in debt by making the battle more than just lining up and moving in a specific direction by giving control over that to people on the battlefield.,history,dc6xoic,5,t5_2qh53
10260800,0,t3_5mwhue,Ill pop in here in case theres time to win your argument just to give examples that come to mind because knowing the exact number is obviously impossible. Ill start with one that most fits what I think your asking for but I will caution you again that it is impossible to answer in the specific for a number of reasons from disputed historicity to the fact that societies of men and women dont just have clean lines where one starts here and the other ends despite our best attempts to make them chronicle them.. Carthage  Founded by DidoRomes cousin empire that taught it how to swim. While the details of the story of her founding the citystate empire are not only broiled in patriarchy but also myth much of the storys plot we will see replayed and replayed again throughout history. Not many dispute her as a real historical figure though again the exact story is disputed. Not many dispute that she founded Carthage in its most historically significant form. AT LEAST as many as Romulus founding Rome haha.Now moving on to started from meager beginnings went on to be the countries unquestioned ruler and starting what could arguably be called a Golden Age but not straight up founding or inventing the idea of the polity itself. Keep in mind if males were on my list this is the section where most of the great historically attested men who pioneered empires and nations would go as well.. Wu  ChinaNot too many Huangdis had vaginas as it essentially means His Imperial Majesty of China who claims Heavens Mandate except for Wu. For starting out as a concubine reigning as the de facto emperor and latter in name for over forty years until your death aint too shabby. Rumor has it she basically strangled a baby to make it happen and I personally wouldnt put it past her but this isnt a reply about nice women its about women who pioneered civilizations. Now as for Golden Age this idea is controversial but the most modern sources Ive seen put it somewhere between a reign of terror with shifting social reform and time of abundance peace and trade for China. Wu left her epitaph blank so Ill take her cue and let you draw your own conclusions. But I can point to some beautiful architecture that stands to this day in the form of Great Wild Goose Pagoda the recasting of the Nine Cauldrons Chinas major expansion during the period of her rule and the security of her dynasty in that her grandson goes on to become a renowned emperor himself Xuanzong Tang and other things I might consider as signs of a prosperous reign of a vigorous China under a new social system led by a girl.. Catherine the Great  RussiaYou dont get the cognonym the Great without doing some pretty impressive shit see Alexander or if you prefer Russian Peter following a coup detat in which her husband Peter  was assassinated she reigned for three decades as an autocrat with a series of courtly favourites who she probably did bang before showering with lavish favors unlike her horse she almost certainly didnt. This time the Catherinian Era of Russia is considered Russias revitalization revolutionary modernization and credited as making Russia a true European Power.Id love to give some more answers and talk of co regencies or when a wife just gets too fed up with her gay husband being too busy galavanting the English countryside with his favourite to rule England she fucks off back to France gets her own boyfriend comes back to England with an army and after emasculating her husband I believe it was in the literal this time rules England for arguable several years through a complicated series of regencies but I think youve picked a losing argument with all those undefinable terms.

10262697,0,t1_dc6405s,Yes they were. I dont care about what sort of literary footwork was needed to be done. The definition of King is absolute and cannot be transcended like that she was merely a Queen who had final say on governing matters and the other king usurpers sovereignty was not recognized by the people. I call a spade a spade.You dont need to go into the wikipedia history version of it as I too am familiar with that. Sorry but nothing you wrote convinced me she was in fact a king... plenty of Europeans kingdoms had Queen rulers Elizabeth Catherine the Great etc... and before you go splitting more hairs yes I understand Catherine was a Tsar but as far as I am concerned there is little difference in actual powerresponsibility between the two titles. What you did convince me of however is that they were indeed splitting hairs for political reasons due to their asinine laws and traditions.,history,dc7bzem,1,t5_2qh53

10272750,0,t1_dc75fpn,This concept is unbelievably important and must always be remembered. Civilian over military in power and control the continuation of which is one of the fundamental pillars of republicanism. Its why I always get nervous about how much we make heroes out of soldiers. When the military is beyond criticism when it can hide behind the banner of patriotism... danger follows. Military by nature should always be held down if order is to be maintained. The opposite is when you get military juntas. Another problem when you cant criticize soldiers or the military is that you forget that theyre men. Its part of the reason why its so fucking easy for originations to fuck over returning soldiers. They become an idea and ideas dont need to be taken care of they dont suffer ptsd or depression. If we focused on the humanity of our soldiers more perhaps suicide rates wouldnt be so high.,history,dc8h0k2,3,t5_2qh53

10296680,0,t3_5n5xpj,As a British communist one thing that deeply frustrates me is the almost total lack of socialist history. I recall doing the Suffragettes and about the Victorian period but there was little attention paid to the workers movement which existed at the time the fight for workers rights or the role of the suffragettes within the bigger picture of civil liberties. Important figures like Rosa Luxembourg Marx or Engels were almost totally absent even from very highlevel history classes Ive taken. Ive said it before and Ill say it again Ive learnt more about the history of the U.K. reading the Morning Star newspaper which has a lot of good historical content than I ever did in a classroom.   Just as another crucial example I didnt learn about the Battle of Cable Street in any real sense until I became a communist. Id vaguely been taught about the Blackshirts about Sir Mosley and about how there was some support for fascism in Britain but this was no way in depth and it was only when I actually researched the subject for myself and read some primary source material mostly The Greater Britain and Fascism  Questions Answered both written by Sir Mosley that I learnt about the BUF as an organisation how they and Sir Mosley fitted into the general history of the s and also about the likes of things like the Battle of Cable Street the Earls Court rally the Defence Regulation B and the internment of BUF members. I was also unaware that some of those who stood at Cable Street were communists and that there existed many communist groups across the UK at the time within the working class communities. ,history,dcb6nht,1,t5_2qh53

There are loads of reasons for the collapse but one of the real reasons was shitty leadership and poor choices. The emperor Diocletian debased coinage to such a degree that it was no longer worth anything mixed with his edict on prices which set a maximum value to be charged for certain goods created massive amounts of poverty.After it split in half and the center of Rome was moved to Constantinople the western Empire was attacked viciously by the Celts and Germanic tribes whilst the East frontiers were also attacked.

I prefer folders because theyre easier to open and take items out without the potential to damage them. But they also sell envelopes that are open on  sides. You could also but some glassine and put a sheet over each on the drawing side. This will help prevent the pencil markings from smudging. Handle the drawings as little as possible and when you do Id recommend using nitrile gloves the blue ones you can get at a Drs office. Archivists usually use cotton gloves but theyre loose fitting so theres more chances to accidentally rip or bend the items. Hands have oils and paper likes to absorb it. Take out all paperclips postits and rubber bands before you store. Anything that will deteriorate and offgass over time. Paper also likes to absorb gases. Paper also has a tendency to go brittle how much depends on the composition of the fibers used when making the paper originally. In times of war paper tended to have fewer cloth fibers or wood pulp in it making it more prone to brittleness but I dont know about the civil war specifically.

Peaceful protests can be effective and are more effective at achieving political goals than violent protests because  nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement information and education and participator commitment. Higher levels of participation then contribute to enhanced resilience a greater probability of tactical innovation increased opportunity for civic disruption and therefore less incentive for the regime to maintain the status quo and shifts in loyalty among opponents erstwhile supporters including members of the military establishment. They find successful nonviolent resistance movements usher in more durable and internally peaceful democracies which are less likely to regress into civil war.

Would they run back to the trench after they lost a number of men and regroup?You do not want to fight in no mans land hence the inferior force would retreat towards frendly trenches.Bayonet fights was very rare either the assulting force was broken by the defenders fire or the defenders did flee before melee to the next trench.Trench raiders did use smaler wepons like knives clubs or pistols handgranades not long rifle with sword bayonet.Remember artillery was the king and machine gun was the queen of the battelfield hence the typical generalities about artillery and machine gun.,history,dcre1sa,92,t5_2qh53

Mistakes are made.  Conclusions are drawn in error and held by many in high esteem to be correct.  One aspect of such phenomena that led up to the setting for these atrocities was the eugenics movement in Europe and the United States in the years leading up to WWII. It is a mistake to think that we as a species have arrived and cannot commit to barbarity again. There is still much we dont know and much we have to learn.  The best lesson of our past is to humble us before the present. Edit I recommend reading The Gulag Archipelago for a thoughtful and deep plumbing of these human depths. gt Ideologythat is what gives evildoing its longsought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others eyes so that he wont hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors.

10608334,0,t3_5rt2iw,This is an amazingly broad question with a number of possible correct answers.  Im going to assume youre talking roughly about the period from  and the life of the average person.Where you live is going to make a huge difference.  Canada and India aside from being part of the British Empire and a similar style of government are very different societies.  Central Canada and Western Canada arent going to be the same either.  Anyway  Im going to talk about Central Canada because I am most familiar with it.There is a fair amount of political liberty and free speech.  Propertyowning British men can probably vote making for the most inclusive democracy in centuries.  The choices of consumer goods are pretty good massive amounts of trade routes and railways are opening up and a lot of military activity going on to secure it.  Everyone wants a piece of this trade and its hard to trust anyone internationally wars are frequent.  Parade ground military tactics are common and military life focuses on discipline and drilling.  A Western Canadian cowboy could end up fighting in South Africa.Work days are long and labour intensive  injuries are common.There are lots of opportunities to move or migrate to opening farmland in the West.  Its not a terrible time for people with big dreams.  In spite of that opportunity social structures are rigid and hard to navigate.  The role youre born into society is likely the role you will die in.  Chances are good you dont have much money and while you arent starving you probably dont have as much to eat as youd like.   Alcohol is cheap and widely available many people drink heavily.   Winter is harsh and influenza devastates your community every winter.  Theres a pretty good intellectual climate a lot of people can read and there are newspapers widely available.  Public schools in the North American sense are increasing literacy and there is a lot of popular literature available.  Cheap novels are popular and there are a few libraries.  There are a few good universities but theyre basically closed to most people.There isnt a lot of leisure time but for interesting events youre watching the newspapers for stories of what is happening in the Boer War what the Royal Family is doing and youre attending church socials and local parades for events like Dominion Day perhaps taking in agricultural fairs or shows.  Traveling circuses and things like Buffalo Bills Wild West Show  or vaudeville performers are on tour.  You can find places to go dancing and speakers tend to tour church halls and public gatherings.Its considered a good time historically but a lot of people live under very basic conditions.,history,dda62ig,1,t5_2qh53

10618995,0,t3_5rxab2,If you want to read a defence of Haig try The Educated Soldier by long time Haig defender John Terraine or The Good Soldier by Gary Mead.Neither defender is truly convincing.  However the best defences of Haig rely on some of the dubious arguments of his opponents and their own moral cowardice and on the nature of the army Haig inherited.Haig played a key role in modernising the British army in the early s. Mead makes much of Haigs constant demands to push professionalism but a closer reading makes this look pretty selfserving he saw himself as a professional because hed done more serious course work than many of his aristocratic rivals but there is no evidence that Haig had any insightful thoughts on tactics or strategy.  Haig himself was an heir to the whiskey family. He married for social connections and was close to the royal family a connection he did not hesitate to make use of. He even wrote regular letters to a German aristocrat during the war!The military Haig became a head of was very small in  and expanded rapidly. British troops and especially the quality of junior leadership probably meant there could be no use of infiltration tactics the Germans used successfully from late  albeit at the cost of using up all the best troops in their army within six months.  British PM David LloydGeorge often attacked Haig but always shunned from replacing him.Other leaders compelled to take the offensive in the war fared just as badly as Haig such as Falkenhayn and Foch and Nivelle. The technology of the time was simply too heavily in favour of the defending side.Haig does however deserve to be condemned. He persisted in offensives and unimaginative frontal assault long after it was clear this was fruitless this was a key lesson of the war from British arms and saved many casualties in World War II.  He did not visit the front lines and although World War I was never going to be a war where leading from the front would be a useful approach he must have been stunningly ignorant of conditions.  His tendentious casualty reports with inflated estimates of German losses were a deliberate lie.  His failure to improve leadership at brigade division and sometimes corps level was obvious with attacks and plans still being cobbled together on the run even in  the improvised tank attack at Bullecort springs to mind as well as the infantrystarved operation at Cambrai in November.  Third Ypres the hideous battle in the mud in late  is Haigs greatest most inexcusable failure.  Even his defenders can do little with that.A defence of Haig is that he correctly saw the Western Front as the key battlefield of the war and won in .  It is hard to credit this as a great insight Churchill the architect of Gallipoli spent a life addicted to sideshows while other efforts to attack through Greece and Italy often just represented efforts to remove resources from Haig.  The events of  dont seem to show Haig as a great genius his army was almost broken in the Spring Offensive and the Germans fully realised that this was their last chance.  The despair associated with its failure and the nearstarvation of Germany by blockade did their work better than British generalship.,history,ddb9p5w,1,t5_2qh53

This possibility would have most certainly affected how the U.S. conducted the war in the Pacific.     P.S. I live in Northern California and we have a small airport.

Augustus claimed to be there to restore the res publica to give it back its republican face and peace. Therefore he still needed the Senate as an important aspect of that republic.This is absolutely right Romans prided themselves on being free citizens of the Republic and they abhorred the concept of monarchy. Keeping the senate enabled the emperors to have the pretense of being legitimate ruler. Roman Emperors were quick to say the werent rulers or monarchs instead styling themselves as princeps meaning first citizen. They may have been first but they maintained they were citizens and nothing more in fact it wasnt until Diocletian in  CE that a Roman Emperor called himself ruler dropped the title of princeps altogether and began acting more monarchistic diminishing the powers of the facade that was the Senate.

10771567,0,t1_ddqrva9,This is technically true but a bit disingenuous itself. You really cant blame any one country in particular for sparking WWI. It was a collaborative effort after a century of industrialized arms races. Germany was in a pitiable spot before Ferdinand was ever assassinated. Any conflict would inevitably pit them between France and Russia known public allies on each flank. Therefore they had to plan accordingly. Part of that plan included knocking France out of the war as soon as possible. Their only route for doing so was through neutral Belgium. Germany didnt want to go to war with Belgium. They offered Belgium a deal in which the German army would simply pass through with no bloodshed. Belgium refused. Now Im not saying that Belgium was wrong to refuse. You cant exactly allow a foreign army to march through your territory and expect to keep your sovereignty. But by all accounts Germanys focus and worry was France not Belgium. Belgium was an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire. Germany was always in a bad position geopolitically with openly hostile superpowers on their every flank. Not excusing or defending their hostility but you have to try to see it from their eyes. The world is accelerating toward war and you have to plan accordingly. ,history,ddr0ab1,13,t5_2qh53

Instead we look at afteraction reports which more accurately tell the story.It was very common in WW for American soldiers to call every single tank they saw a Tiger Tank.  However when the experts go out after the battle and properly identify what happened they would revise the initial reports from the soldiers on the field.On the Eastern Front there were many reports where SS units would claim to have annihilated entire tank platoons that actually were not even in the area.  Kill counts were inflated by a lot of armies but the SS would have the most drastic inflations from what Ive read.Since we now have a pretty good idea of what units were and were not engaged we can have a better understanding of what actually happened.So the short answer is yes when some soldier claims his organization was the best in the world and this soldier also happened to be a hardcore Nazi then I consider that propaganda.,history,ddrrjuk,2,t5_2qh53

10816631,0,t1_ddvnqqk,Hi! It looks like you are talking about the book Guns Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond.The book over the past years has become rather popular which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On rhistory we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written. Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons . In academic history there isnt such thing as one definitive authority or work on things there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to everything.  . There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of Guns Germs and Steel and there are some very real issues with Diamonds work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. In an ideal world every time the book was posted in rhistory it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put that isnt always going to happen and as a result we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the rhistory mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced.It should also be noted that being critical of someones work isnt that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research. Below youll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject further below youll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.  Other works covering the same and similar subjects.  Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest  New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Last Days of the Inca Epidemics and Enslavement Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast  The Great Divergence Why the West Rules for Now Ecological Imperialism The Biological Expansion of Europe  Criticism on Guns Germs and SteelMany historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecologicalgeographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history those just so stories dont adequately explain human history. Its true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.Cherrypicked data while ignoring the complexity of issues  In his chapter Lethal Gift of Livestock on the origin of human crowd infections he picks  pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However when diving into the genetic and historic data only two pathogens maybe influenza and most likely measles could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture domestication and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didnt support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas.   A similar case of cherrypicking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.gt Pizarros military advantages lay in the Spaniards steel swords and other weapons steel armor guns and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people raising a Spanish flag and calling game over. Conquest was a constant process of negotiation accommodation and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya citystates maintained independence for two hundred years after contact were conquered and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in  dislodged the Spanish for a decade and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological advantage in this case guns and steel did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced and conquest was never a cut and dry issue which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest  Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. Pizarro Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supportingjustifying their claim on the territory riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings bravery and outstanding deeds while minimizing the work of native allies pure dumb luck and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamonds thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.The construction of the arguments for GGampS paints Native Americans specifically and the colonized world in general as categorically inferior. To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires unable react to new weaponsmilitary tactics unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape incapable of mounting resistance once conquered too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them and doomed to die because they failed to build cities domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

10840287,0,t1_ddxsgfl,Ahh OK.Yeah I think definitely youre on the right track in terms of the Spanish  Arabic origins given the history between Spain and the Philippines of course!In terms of deriving a concrete meaning from the name I think unfortunately youve gone as far as you can. Too much of the true meaning has been lost to time it would seem. However Ive just thought of another possible scenario. This could be totally wrong but its just a suggestion... In Ireland there are many surnames that were supplanted by English ones as the Irish language  customs were suppressed by the English. Sometimes this was done phonetically. The surname Mac an Ghabhan for example was rendered McGowan. However that same surname was also rendered Smith the literal translation of the word Gabhan. Both of those are logical enough ways of doing it.However in the worst cases rather than create a new English surname from the Irish one a preexisting but unrelated English surname which sounded similar to the Irish was used. For example the surname Harrington is of English origin. In Ireland however it was used as a replacement for  Airchdain which is totally unrelated. This unfortunately can shroud the true origins of a surname.So perhaps a similar situation occurred in the Philippines under Spanish rule. Perhaps some native surnames were translated into Spanish using existing surnames such as Atazar. This could be probably is  wrong but maybe its something you could look into. ,history,ddy3ki5,1,t5_2qh53

I mean its not like Ive published on the topic of metaphor before and have been published as a writer of fiction and was slamming your metaphor as frankly a poorlyconceived one. Its also not as though I currently enjoy no renown IRL whatsoever precisely in relation to my work including the part where I formerly taught academic philosophy. Quantum philosophy is a widelyused term and equally widely derided as conceptuallyconfused nonsense which nearly everything going by that name is. I have no quarrel with metaphor whatsoever indeed I largely subscribe to the dicta of Wittgenstein that philosophy really ought to be written as a form of poetic composition and that advancement in philosophy consists of the development of novel similes and metaphors. Certain folks who compose metaphors like Wittgenstein  Cormac McCarthy or Gerard Manley Hopkins or Ezra Pound  do so in strikingly original andor aesthetically compelling ways. We should all aspire to do so in that kind of brilliant manner. You regrettably did not. I dont mean to be a dick but dont mind if I am claiming refuge in poetry or art in no way licenses conceptual sloppiness or mediocrityvergingonsheerincompetence in crafting metaphor especially if the art or poetry in question is bad art or bad poetry.

I really dont think youre understanding the dynamics at play here.It wouldnt have gotten to that point.  The government controlled the BBC and could censor the newspapers.  The king expressly needed permission to access those channels.  It was not a matter of punishing him.Britain was a constitutional monarchy that had devolved all political power from the king by this point.  Directly disobeying and attempting to overrule the government would have provoked a constitutional crisis.  This would have pit the King against parliament if it even got to that point  it wouldnt have.  Even Edward knew exactly what that meant  the power in England had been entirely in the hands of parliament for a long time by this point.  As to your claims of his supporters I think it might be more accurate that the monarchy had supporters.  He personally had some mostly apolitical admirers and a few contacts but he was not a political player by any stretch of the imagination.I could really go on about this especially about the degree to which all felt constrained by tradition and propriety and the full weight of society behind that constraint.

They Soviets already occupied those countries at the end of the war and there was nothing short of another war that would get them to give them up. The American people wouldnt have stood for FDR or Truman Eisenhower was just a general and didnt make that level of decision pushing the U.S. into another war as WWII wrapped up. Add on top of that the war in Europe being over months before the war in Japan meaning that either the Soviets got  months to consolidate their hold on those countries before America came after them or America starting a war with the Soviets before the war with Japan was finished potentially prolonging that war.,history,dedjov4,11,t5_2qh53

Thats why the Canadians so fiercely resisted and repulsed the American attempt to invade at the start of the war.These concessions to the French colonists were actually a contributing factor toward American anger before the Revolution along with the Royal Proclamation Line prohibiting settlement beyond the Appalachians the colonists felt that the British government was impeding their ability to settle new land and in this case remove the French identity.

I believe that anyone can understand Christs message to humanity that he is the only way truth and life. I believe that all Scripture is god breathed and infallible. While that is a blanket statement and has a lot that goes with it I.E. what about Old Testament law? what it the New Covenant? I think a lot of Christians use the Ill interpret the Bible on my own terms or I think there are many interpretations of the Bible and none of them are wrong as a cop out of fundamental principles that are clearly stated in the Bible. This seems to be especially true with the question of salvation which honestly doesnt surprise me. Its hard to believe in a God that separates the sheep from the goats and a lot of people will do anything to get out of believing it even if it means theology grounded in nonscriptural roots like their own understanding. Funny that the Bible tells us to Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding Proverbs . My main point is there is a lot that we can discuss and debate on in Christianity but when firmly grounded in scripture I just cant see how theres so much wiggle room for some people in some areas.,history,degwmg5,2,t5_2qh53

11021798,0,t1_degsscd,Youre right about the part concerning his sister especially regarding Neitzsches idea of the bermensch however and I know this isnt your fault but because Nietzsche was so influential and his philosophy was so complex much of the greater public gets him very wrong in all the ways that he fought so passionately against so it makes me a little sad when people misconstrue him. I would also like to preface by saying Im not a scholar so people may disagree and I would love to talk about it but I am going for my undergrad in philosophy and probably will study Nietzsche for my PHD so I like to think i have at least an inkling of sense on this stuff. Nietzsche wasnt just against modern day Christians and hypocrites although that was a theme in his work he hated the doctrine of Christianity very much. His main argument was that the dogma was a constant putdown of man telling people that they were evil and needed to be saved etc. He thought it was the religious manifestation of our masochism in a way. However he was supportive of Christianitys capacity to provide meaningmoral valuesits more complicated and lots of people way smarter than me will disagree so take that with a grain of salt... but the point still stands. This is where his so often taken out of context God is dead quote is relevant. The actual quote is beautifully written so Ill share it its this God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?Nietzsche The Gay Science Section   You can see its not sarcastic at all its the opposite regretful and desperate. He was afraid of what he saw as Western societies inevitable collapse into Nihilism and even though he was appalled by much of Christianity he was even more horrified by the philosophical and scientific trends he was seeing. ,history,dehagwr,138,t5_2qh53

The books primary topic is why the European nations colonized much of the world and the Chinese did not when they were actually in a better position to do so in the th th and th centuries.He has a multitude of reasons the one that sticks out to me was Europe was so divided they tended to compete fiercely with each other in trade.

Although that was one of the worst but in the end Africa came out as nationstates with some idea of what modernity was whilst before a good amount of them were not united and rather tribal. Granted the nation states created with decolonization werent properly divided culturally in a lot of areas which caused a lot of issues later on but in the end they arguably came out better than before.

11346973,0,t1_dfhjqxt,I wouldnt trust Livy too much about the surrender of the Numidian cavalry. Livy is known for not always writing objective history.  For example when a Roman army got ambushed Livy wrote the Romans were shattered but made groups on their own and resisted the Carthaginians with great courage.  When the Carthaginians did something dumb Livy simply said they failed and the Romans were much betterA major stereotype the Romans had about the Carthaginians was that they were dishonest and not to be trusted.  This is why I think that we should not believe Livys account about the Numidians when only Livy wrote about this event. I think only Livy wrote about this if someone else did please tell me It is easy to say after a big defeat that the enemy were just cheating instead of accepting they made strategic mistakes themselves.  ,history,dfi5qis,3,t5_2qh53

11387322,0,t1_dfmmtne,Youre very welcome I randomly stumbled on it in a bookshop in China and didnt for a moment regret the hefty investment hefty because of import taxes.  Its an academic book  still very readable I think but not written in that halfjokey tone of many books aimed at the general public. There are pages and pages of reference tables for example rank comparisons between countries price index comparisons etc.   What got me was the level of detail  Rodgers talks about the logistics of finding good oak trees for the hulls and masts in diminishing woodlands the introduction of uniforms the development of the docks the sailing expertise of Charles II and James I which influenced naval policy the difficulties of navigation in those centuries he briefly mentions homosexuality in the navy gives his take on the Mutiny On The Bounty and on and on and on.

It was thought that in a black magic ritual it was actually demons that took over the corpse and not the spirits of the deceased. So this could be an attempt to prevent the dead from being possessed? Although then it would have been easier to bury them in consecrated ground...In case the people mutilated couldnt be buried in sacred ground this reeks of extreme corporeal punishment for some moral wrongdoing.

Unfortunately for them Parma wasnt ready and didnt want to go.  His plan for the invasion had been modified by Phillip and he wasnt all that happy.  Plus he was winning in the lowlands.  The Spanish has about  fighting ships and the English had far fewer.  The English had better guns but were light on powder.  By the end of that fieat engagement many of them were out or dangerously low and they had inflicted only light losses on the Spanish.  Drakes idea most likely for the fireship attack while they organized at harbor was the master stroke.  The Spanish has shown they could escort Parma to the shores of England and they were desperate to find a way to stop them.  The fireship scattered the Spanish fleet.  When they regroup North  up near Scotland the winds were highly unfavorable to sailing back South again so they decided to sail round to the north.  Big mistake and the rest is history.The English fought well but they didnt have the staying power and numbers to actually defeat the Spanish.

Depending on various sources somewhere between  to over  Chinese mostly civilians and prisoners of war were killed. Those who had bullets ripping through their bodies as they ran away could have been said the lucky ones as many other victims suffered worse fates. Deaths resulted from bayoneting burning crushing by tanks burying and decapitation were common. Even worse were those who bled to death by after being nailed to telephone poles or doors castrated delimbed or disemboweled. And then there were the over  cases of rapes victims of which crime ranged from girls under  years of age to over  years of age many of those who were raped itself a grotesque crime were further tortured by the Japanese troops by impalement of their vaginas with everything from beer bottles to bayonets. Few but not unseen atrocities were committed by the most sadistic who tore out fetuses from pregnant women with bayonets and forced sons to rape their mothers. In  a millimeter film made by Episcopal missionary John Magee was smuggled out of China and eventually made its way to the United States. It was shown anonymously to certain US Congressmen US Army and Red Cross members. The original films were found in the s after being lost for more than fifty years documenting aftermath of the atrocity. Over time many Japanese veterans of the war stepped forth and admitted to the atrocities that took place confirming the widespread violence.Journalist Edgar Snow provided the following eyewitness accountThousands of men were led out of the Nanjing International Safety Zone ostensibly for labour battalions and lined up and machinegunned. Sometimes groups were used for bayonet exercises. When the victors grew bored with such mild sport they tied their victims poured kerosene over their heads and cremated them alive. Others were taken out to empty trenches and told to simulate Chinese soldiers. Japanese officers then led their men in assaults to capture these enemy positions and bayoneted the unarmed defenders.Sourcemore.,history,dg0i6ti,3,t5_2qh53

11529502,0,t3_64k04v,I got a wellpaying job as a paralegal coming straight out of college with my history degree. I would say that the writing and critical thinking abilities I picked up during the course of my degree are things I use pretty much every day. Getting a history degree does not prevent you from going to law school or med school or business school or grad school if you so choose. Nor does it prevent you from pursuing any number of careers in law services government education etc. etc. though probably not a career in the hard sciences or programming. The only thing I would do differently is that I would double major probably in political science or business not because I feel the history degree is unemployable but because double majoring gets you two degrees for the price of one.Tbh the thing thats most important and that people have sort of been overlooking in this thread is that the degree doesnt matter as much as getting to know people who can help you out in the future. Part of the reason that I got a job coming straight out of undergrad when so many of my peers in all degrees did not was because I made lots of friends and knew lots of people and was able to ask around if anyone had a job and could recommend me for it. My friend was a paralegal her firm had an opening and she was able to recommend me which got me an interview immediately. I made friends at my new firm who eventually got me a job at another firm that included a  raise and a much better work environment. I think thats probably one of the most important lesson to pick up. Who you know matters a whole lot more than what you studied barring a STEM degree. Finally let me just say that you really need to be careful about how much the degree is going to cost you in regards to student loans. If your family is poor you may be able to qualify for some type of financial aid that will dramatically help you. You really need to investigate all those options and ALL THE SCHOLARSHIP OPTIONS you can. Scholarships are free money and I wish I pursued them more heavily. The rstudentloans community is pretty good about giving you the lowdown on student loans and how best to mitigate them.

There are YouTube channels websites podcasts free resources to learn about pretty much whatever you want for free. You can still love history and learn it even if you arent a history major. The degree is more of a societal litmus test for the labor market and less an indication of what you enjoy learning. You used to be able to get a great working class job with just about any degree.

I also went to graduate school and have two Masters degrees in related fields. For my current job does it matter that my degree was in History in particular? Not really I probably could have had any undergraduate degree and would have been hired just the same. However the skills that I learned in that degree and especially in my Masters programs definitely make me better at my job. I believe that the writing research and analytical skills that I picked up contribute greatly to my ability to receive promotions more frequently than my colleagues. It wasnt really the content of the degrees that helped me get here so much as the skills they taught me along the way.Most of all studying history has changed the way that I see the world. I take a much longer view of current events. I am better able to recognize and look past my implicit biases. Rather than reacting to events on impulse I try to put them into a larger context and examine how they would be viewed from other perspectives. One of the first things you will learn in a history program is that there is no truth of what happened or if there is we will never actually know it there are only differing primary sources that we must piece together to resemble some sort of amalgamation of the average persons view of an event. History is not what happened history is interpretation. This mindset has permeated other areas of my life and what I once saw as very black and white is now a giant gray area. I think this makes me a better person and I wish more people focused on this type of study of history rather than the memorization of facts.I wouldnt change my degree in history for anything!

Ridiculously huge student loan debt is one of the US worst problems.Research job postings on websites knowing theyre typically  of available jobs the other  usually comes from networking recommendations from people youve built relationships with.

11590138,0,t1_dg9r0db,Hi! It looks like you are talking about the book Guns Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond.The book over the past years has become rather popular which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On rhistory we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written. Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons . In academic history there isnt such thing as one definitive authority or work on things there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to everything.  . There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of Guns Germs and Steel and there are some very real issues with Diamonds work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. In an ideal world every time the book was posted in rhistory it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put that isnt always going to happen and as a result we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the rhistory mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced.It should also be noted that being critical of someones work isnt that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research. Below youll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject further below youll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.  Other works covering the same and similar subjects.  Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest  New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Last Days of the Inca Epidemics and Enslavement Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast  The Great Divergence Why the West Rules for Now Ecological Imperialism The Biological Expansion of Europe  Criticism on Guns Germs and SteelMany historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecologicalgeographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history those just so stories dont adequately explain human history. Its true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.Cherrypicked data while ignoring the complexity of issues  In his chapter Lethal Gift of Livestock on the origin of human crowd infections he picks  pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However when diving into the genetic and historic data only two pathogens maybe influenza and most likely measles could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture domestication and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didnt support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas.   A similar case of cherrypicking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.gt Pizarros military advantages lay in the Spaniards steel swords and other weapons steel armor guns and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people raising a Spanish flag and calling game over. Conquest was a constant process of negotiation accommodation and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya citystates maintained independence for two hundred years after contact were conquered and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in  dislodged the Spanish for a decade and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological advantage in this case guns and steel did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced and conquest was never a cut and dry issue which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest  Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. Pizarro Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supportingjustifying their claim on the territory riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings bravery and outstanding deeds while minimizing the work of native allies pure dumb luck and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamonds thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.The construction of the arguments for GGampS paints Native Americans specifically and the colonized world in general as categorically inferior. To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires unable react to new weaponsmilitary tactics unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape incapable of mounting resistance once conquered too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them and doomed to die because they failed to build cities domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

I operated out of Al Asad Airbase so the first one had me assigned to a can and everything within a week of arriving. Afghanistan was different as we went off to secure a piece of desert in the middle of nowhere so it took two weeks to get to there and settled and on patrol. The guys fighting in WW and Korea and to some extent Vietnam took far more time to get to the theater and once there it took more time to get men and material in place. In both OEF and OIF we were living in a near constant  state of threat. Sure Al Asad was big and had way better defenses but that didnt stop people from trying to motaring it. They would almost always fail but it was possible. In Afghanistan it was way more common to come under rocket attack or a drive by rpg. Anyways the point is youre constantly on alert. In WW the average number of sustained days of combat was . You might spend a year in the Pacific but you generally didnt live under combat conditions for greater than  days. You took an island got back on the boat and sailed for the next one.  Korea was slightly higher. Vietnam was around . Now its basically the duration of time youre in country. We have a far more sophisticated and advanced military than we did in  but we also spend more time fighting per soldier than they did and it absolutely has a negative effect on us.  ,history,dgamxyv,12,t5_2qh53

What Im trying to say is we are the original European immigrants and although we stayed a different people than France for several centuries we now feel both French and Breton and still have an identity as a people. Our culture is as strong as if we were still a country and our food is too crepes if you havent heard of it. We now consider our history as a root for us but past the unification with France weve considered French history as the new one.And as a Breton guy I get both the Native American and the emigrated American point of view  I wouldnt want my peoples history to be forced down the throats of nonBreton people but I get that a people who emigrated search for an history to learn about. Sure sometimes its irritating to learn about an history that is not mine or my ancestors but I guess we cant really complain when we are a minority can we?So Id say it simply  learn about the US History back to its foundation but dig a bit to at least . Some of you may have roots from Italia Irish Spain France for what I know even from Asia from Oceania or from Africa but as a multiracial people learn the history of the ground from the time it has a name. And Im talking about America there.To resume Bretons lived in Great Britain before the British people from Scandinavian kicked us out to France. We took our time to adjust but we now learn French history at school and Breton history with our festivals and families.,history,dgu54jg,2,t5_2qh53

Anyways if you want to read up on the history of the libertarian socialist movement in Spain I highly suggest reading The Anarchist Collectives History of the FAI and Freedom Fighters from the Black Rose Books.Ultimately the libertarian socialists were betrayed by the Stalinist republic.
