4805095,0,t3_3gm4oy,I can say that Ive used Sketch on average around hrsday since November last year. Ive never experienced any big issues. I can maybe remember Sketch crashing  times this year alone which is against Photoshop crashing on me once every other day.Ive used Sketch on many different Macs everything from a horribly underpowered Mac Mini to a beast MacBook Pro  and Sketch worked great on all machines Im currently on a MacBook Pro  Early  GHz  GB and Sketch flows perfectly on it as well  I expect it to perform even better once El Capitan offically ships.I honestly think Sketch is way cheaper than it could be so grab it now! The only frustrating part about Sketch is the export feature which from time to time exports files like .svg wrong.,sketchapp,cu0803g,2,t5_2zquh

5725030,0,t3_3sqxgc,I had this bug. Its to do with which app you use to unarchive it. If you use the standard Archive Utility it should be fine. Its when you use something like The Unarchiver theres a problem.,sketchapp,cx6qv72,1,t5_2zquh
5740649,0,t3_3trhaw,Unusable on El Capitan is a huge deceptive reach of a headline. I still have your garden variety Sketch bugs fucking lineheight here and there but Im running at the same specs you are and unusable is not even remotely true.,sketchapp,cx8om4j,6,t5_2zquh
5978282,0,t3_3xa489,Are your items in that case maybe not aligned at px? I could imagine rendering stuff that would cause things like that coming from having an item positioned at . pixels or so. Or are the values literally px off in the inspector?,sketchapp,cy3a82w,3,t5_2zquh

6888300,0,t3_49tewb,This plugin is not as straigtforward to install as it may seems. Let me try to explain the steps how I got it to workHow to get the pluginThe plugin is hosted at github Here you can find a link to a zip file containing the plugin.What do I need to get stared?Before this plugin can be used you need to have the following things installed copied from the github page Sketch gt . not with the sandboxed version ie from the App Store. Git Sketchtool installed in usrlocalbinsketchtool default locationIt might be a little hard to check if you have Git and get the Sketchtool installed it involves a command in the terminal. But dont let thet scare you. Follow the steps belowInstall the required software Install sketch you probably already have it installed. Just make sure you are on version . or higher Install Git you probably have git already installed as well. To find out open Terminal.app from the utilities folder. When the terminal is loaded type git and press the return key. If you have git installed it lists options on how to use git starting with the line usage git version help C ltpathgt c namevalue. If this is the case close the terminal. You have Git on your system. If you get command not found git or something like that download and install Git via their website Install Sketchtool again you have to open the terminal and type the following command ApplicationsSketch.appContentsResourcessketchtoolinstall.sh and press ltreturngt.Install the plugin On the Github page download the zip file. Click the Download link under Installation Unzip the downloaded file and double click the Git.sketchplugin fileUse the pluginIf everything went well you have the plugin installed. A few notes about using the pluginBefore Git is able to track the progress on a file it needs to be told to track the folder you are working in. Go to Plugins gt Git and click on Init git repo. Now the directory your file is in is under version control. This is called a repo repository. Add your file to the repo by clicking in the same menu on Add file to git. Every new file needs to be added to repo this way.For more info on the workflow of this plugin see the Workflow section.,sketchapp,d0x3tlq,1,t5_2zquh
7056561,0,t3_49y0cu,Hi I use Zeplin. It is great to communicate with developers you can build your styleguide based on your Sketch file add all typefaces and color palette or add a specific typeface or color manually from one screen.Other option is Craft. This is a plugin for Sketch made by inVision. You have the Styles section where you can Create Styles. It creates a new page on your Sketch file with all of the styles in your screens typefaces color palette and so on. I think Styles Craft is better to deliver a pdf to a customer and Styleguide Zeplin to communicate with developers.,sketchapp,d1g7xzy,1,t5_2zquh

7271269,0,t3_4en9h3,This update is insanely frustrating!!! Symbols are basically useless now. Im shocked that this company would ruin such an amazing piece of software. This is beyond disappointing. Ive been advocating Sketch to people in my industry for a while now and this just makes me look bad. ugh,sketchapp,d24p014,3,t5_2zquh
7576852,0,t3_4j3fqr,. Add a ShapeEllipse I think its shortcut is E. Add a photo to your canvas. With the ellipse below the photo in your layers list right click on it and choose Use as Mask,sketchapp,d33g9n4,1,t5_2zquh
7635365,0,t3_4ioudf,I have a folder in my Dropbox that houses my templates so it can sync across both of my Macs. Then I create symlinks to the Dropbox folder on each Mac. To Sketch it thinks the templates are in the usual place but its actually just an alias to the Dropbox folder. Its been bulletproof for me but I havent really tried hitting it up with both Macs at once so no guarantees. ,sketchapp,d3a3k6a,2,t5_2zquh

11422869,0,t1_dfqri6s,You could try reducing the intensity of the blending mode in CSS. Also you might try multiply in CSS and giving the hex code an alpha value rgba to adjust to be similar to sketch. Are you using WebKit blending modes?,sketchapp,dfqrr7t,2,t5_2zquh
11585632,0,t3_65cw54,No. Is your file size larger than MB? I have performance issues around that size specifically when I have a lot of raster images in the file for reference or photographs depending on the purpose. Specifically I have had this issue when I have a lot of Unsplash photos at full size in my file.Sketch can handle larger file sizes so long as nothing is raster.,sketchapp,dg98lhl,5,t5_2zquh
