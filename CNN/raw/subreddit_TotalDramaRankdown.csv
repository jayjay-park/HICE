5409919,0,t3_3p42va,. TDA IzyyWe are defiantly moving into characters that arent bad. And Izzy is not a bad character at all but this just wasnt her season. She was eliminated pretty early which I felt was good for her. She was pretty funny for as long as she lasted but the season really diddnt need her. Then she returned and unlike Island where her return was amazing this one was not the best. Her different personalities were entertaining but it would have been just as good in the aftermaths.  Her and Owen diddnt really develop this season which sucks and despite returning she still didnt stay long. She wasnt bad this season she just wasnt needed.I will be nominating TDWT Lindsay. I love Lindsay but at the end of the day she was barley in this season and didnt do much unlike characters like Justin Sugar and Bridgette who stayed long in their seasons.uAlmightyOZ,TotalDramaRankdown,cw36dwi,2,t5_39toq

5425573,0,t3_3pbrl8,. Anne Maria Total Drama Revenge of the Island th placeAnne Maria is a solid contestant one I dont have any particularity bad things to say about but the reason I cut her instead of Cody is gonna be at the end of this writeup.Anne Maris is pretty hilarious in the premiere spraying Dakota and Staci and jazz. She has a really cool accent she sucked pretty hard in the challenge from what I recall and that was fun. Also her audition tape is pretty fucking great yo. Overall Anne Maria has a pretty good start.I also liked her in Ice Ice Baby and enjoyed her conflict with Jo and I cant say I didnt enjoyed her hair jokes. Now for the rest of the season Anne Marias big focus is on her relationship with Vito which I dont really care about tbh. It does lead us to her conflict with Zoey which was enjoyable even if Zoey was pretty infuriating and had no right to be mad at Anne Maria.Anne Marias big episode comes in well... her boot episode. I actually sorta liked her interaction with Feral Ezekiel remembering that he was kid from last season and stuff so yeah. The problem with Anne Maria comes in the end of the episode where she quits thats just a sloppy and crappy writing because the entire stupid love triangle between her Zoey and Mike was never resolved. Her relationship with Mike was never resolved and neither was her conflict with Zoey.So yeah Anne Maria is a fun contestant with a crappy ending a laRevenge of the Islandstyle. I would have probably put her above Cody since shes slightly funnier but she is not superduper memorable to me and she comes from a pretty forgettable season so. For my nomination well Im glad most of yall followed the trend of nominating premerge people but now Im gonna make a controversial nomination. Alejandro. Hes a fantastic antagonist interesting character with great interactions but Im not super into his personality in that specific season. It was a tough decision but Im stick to it.,TotalDramaRankdown,cw568zv,3,t5_39toq
