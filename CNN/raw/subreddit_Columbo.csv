11391743,0,t3_5snf0w,gtWhat was the purpose of that entire situation? Just to make the Private Eye unavailable for questioning?Im going off of memory IIRC do those scenes tie in to another suspect? Youll notice that detective shows often have to incorporate a few seemingly unnecessary characters in order to muddy the waters make it less obvious who the guilty killer is. Maybe its that?,Columbo,dfn8jqj,1,t5_2twu7
11540658,0,t3_64oese,Well that is one of the most unexpected things I can think of!  Somebody decided there would be enough interest in a pair of Columbo themed shoes to manufacture them and charge  for them.  I totally want a pair but I have never paid that much for shoes.  Im sure that Columbo never has either.Its kind of depressing that they spelled the name wrong Colombo but I like some of the little details.  Theres a little picture of Dog on the tongue of the shoe and Columbos license plate number on the back.  They said that the colors reflect his famous trenchcoat shirt and chinos another blooper isnt it a raincoat? but I would have liked to have seen them go all out and make the shoe the color of his battered old coat and maybe the sole could be the color of his car.  Even if theyre not perfect I am absolutely thrilled that these exist.  The world needs more love for Columbo!  I wonder if these are being made and sold only in Europe?  One of the websites offering them is in Switzerland.,Columbo,dg44vwd,7,t5_2twu7
