2692486,0,t1_cn9tkf9,Well were not great for clubs out here but the bars are cool. Hitch makes the best old fashioned in the city.  Ceilei Cottage has good Irish food fresh made bread  a decent beer list and yurts Hi Lo is a perfect mix of cool and open Boots and Bourbon is good if you want country and cool in one place. They have a bull to ride.  I will be trying Bill Hicks over the next week or two. It claims to be a tiki dive bar so it is either going to be spectacularly good or spectacularly badThere are of course others but these ones are some of the more popular. Give em a shot.,Torontoevents,cna0zwf,1,t5_2s0wq

11143205,0,t1_ddzzf02,Hey apologies for the later reply. The admission price for us is mainly a means of testing how serious participants are about attending. Initial event were free and we had huge drop offs in numbers between signup and actual attending which means we wasted a lot of money in catering and generally makes it harder to plan. We run our events quite different to most hackathons with constant mentors at hand quality food and a selection of local crafts beers that wont run out. We also have reduced ticket prices for students contact us if price is really a problem. Give the Toronto event is now in the past we had some great results and good attendance. Looking forward to next year! And the Vancouver hackathon later in the year,Torontoevents,dev2k38,2,t5_2s0wq
