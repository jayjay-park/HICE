5591677,0,t1_cwq6t49,I like your idea but theres a few things stopping me from doing that.Thinking about it more I like the idea of dropping Scrounger and taking Sneak instead. Ammunition may not be too hard to come across and the perks from the sneak skill are hard to miss out on.That said I am worried about the lack of AGI possibly making sneak redundant and too low on LUCK would destroy any possibly of critical hits.Actually yeah thanks for the input Ill drop Scrounger for Sneak!,Fallout4Builds,cwq77ht,1,t5_3acsu

5618462,0,t3_3s2mg9,Consider this buildThis takes into account the fact that the Perception bobblehead is found within the first hours of play so you can afford to lower it by one point without worrying about losing out on Locksmith because youll just get the bobbleheadS for the same reason as your build access to armourer nothing moreP for Pickpocket Rifleman and Locksmith with bobblehead. Maybe awareness might be good on a first playthrough to learn about enemy DR valuesE because not a useful SPECIAL for sneak just like yoursC for access to Local Leader plus a higher C will allow for more successful speech checksI raised from your  granting access to Hacker a must come on man and Scrapper which is nice if youre a hoarder like me and want to come across items easily I had a leftover SPECIAL after building this and decided to put it here to raise from  to . Higher INT also means you gain more xp per taskA just like you for Ninja Sneak Action Boy Commando Gunslinger All great perksL lowered from  because dont need to spend so many points just for criticals this has Bloody Mess its just so god damn fun Scrounger and Fortune Finder which are great low level Luck perks.TLDR  S P E C I A L Ill most likely be using this build or similar I like sneaking,Fallout4Builds,cwtiw86,3,t5_3acsu

5629324,0,t3_3s4o62,I agree with the call to take one from Perception and allocate it elsewhere. I also think the chemist perk isnt anything spectacular to me as I always find I have way more meds on me than I can handle anyways. So maybe even drop an INT point as well. Maybe add one point to CHR to get you to those juicy pacify skills earlier. And possibly add the other point to AGI to get you a couple more VATS points and a means to get  agi with a bobblehead giving you access to action boy.,Fallout4Builds,cwuvds6,0,t5_3acsu

5665973,0,t1_cwz5sqj,Lets put it this way. With max Scrounger you will never have ammo issues no matter how weak your actual character is. You are bound to find some good legendaries eventually that will obliterate enemies regardless of how invested you are in offensive perks anyway. I completely agree with idiot savant being important. If you intend to play one character long term Id say it is a must have. This guy shows how strong it is even with  it,Fallout4Builds,cwzf3pq,5,t5_3acsu
5671688,0,t3_3sssd5,Honestly anything works. Im currently playing as powerarmor melee on Survival.First perk went to Idiot Savant and I started with  Luck obviously. The rest of the points were  to Strength for Rooted  to Agility for Blitz.Rooted gives you a flat  damageDR when youre stationary. Needless to say its a huge DPS and defense boost. This works in VATS I think so yay for that. Compare it to things like Bloody Mess with its measly  damage increase or any weapon skill that only gives  damage and Rooted looks INSANELY good for meleeunarmed builds.Next comes Blitz which is lovely. Basically it lets you start melee combat in VATS from range. So no need to slog to the enemy you can just instantly VATSteleport to him. Whats more I believe if you are undetected hidden sneaking when you activate the attack Blitz doesnt break stealth so you teleport to a distant target and pretty much shot it with the damage boost of a surprise attack. The only downside you cant teleport upwards in my experience so far. So enemies on walkways are a pain in the butt.And then you take your weapon skill whether you want melee weapons or unarmed. Which gives additional  damage on top of  from Rooted. So at this point youre pretty much shotting Raiders with a baseball bat.At this point you can pick a direction to go in. You can go for Power Armor which is a pretty good idea with a perk like Pain Train. When you sprint at enemies you stagger and damage them. So that works nicely  Blitz them do one hit drop VATS sprint one step to stagger them and finish the rest of the fight using power swings.Action BoyAction Girl really helps regen AP faster and you already have quite a bit of it from having  Agility to start with. So you can VATS until cows come home.And at this point your character is pretty much complete. Theres some quality of life improvements to be had sure. You can go into improved bartering for example which allows you to sell nearempty Fusion Cores for more money and buy full ones for less. So running out of cores wont be an issue. Scrounger will help too though for me its mostly just the extra income from selling all that extra ammo and buying even more Fusion Cores.The best part so far is that the combat is a bit more visceral and a bit more handson. And theres wonderful fatality animations. ,Fallout4Builds,cx04nin,1,t5_3acsu
5681770,0,t1_cx1al4r,Run and gun style is played like CoD. You use cover and grenades and you dont make much use of vats. Im playing run and gun on survival and my special looks like thisSPECIALThis build assumes you get the special book at the start of the game. This build has all of the basic perks unlocked from the start. Gun nut science armorer lockpicking demo expert perception bobble is early. I take more INT because chems are insane in this game. I go higher endurance then most people on this board because chem resistant pairs very well with chemist. Bloody mess and scrounger is available as well.As for which gun you use its all personal flavor. I personally like the combat rifle. Solid damage semi auto to abuse rifleman and a good magazine. Rifleman also works with shotguns. Laser rifles are a good choice as well.If rifles and shotguns arent your thing pistols are very good as well. They dont have the raw damage capabilities that rifles have rifleman also gives armor pen but they tend to have faster fire rates.Full autos is dont like because their damage is too low. They chew through ammo really fast. The only full auto i would suggest is a bleed full auto because bleeds stack. Grenades are very strong this time around especially when throw next to a car. A word of warning though they hurt yourself alot also. If your gonna take demo expert be very careful because its easy to blow your self up if you arent careful.,Fallout4Builds,cx1do5p,4,t5_3acsu
5687328,0,t3_3t0d6x,Im about the same level as you and Im a bit surprised as a pure melee character you havent taken the Blacksmith perk yet.

5727012,0,t3_3tko0y,Ive finished the game recently using a melee build on survival. Its quite hard on the early levels but very satisfying once you get a few good weapons and some important perks.This build could work. strength allows you to level up big leagues armorer and blacksmith. The downside is that you might lack some melee dmg. perception just to get the perk awareness. endurance should be enough if you are planning stealth otherwise I would invest  more points. agility to get blitz. This perk is awesome regardless if you are going stealth or not. The perk ninja is mandatory for stealth and action boy is good for both but slightly better for non stealth builds.Since awareness is not mandatory or a game changing perk you could remove the points in perception and raise strength or endurance.Personally I used this build and started focusing around stealth perks later on.Srry for my poor english btw.,Fallout4Builds,cx6zpow,2,t5_3acsu

5774895,0,t3_3u8q34,This sounds similar to what Im making.This is what my build looks like so farS P  early bobblehead for demolitions expert E C I A LSo heavy gunner would be important as it stacks with demolitions expert on missile launchers and fatmen and with the skill book and the bobblehead you should be able to rush perception up to  for demolition expert. The high charisma will allow you to trade more for ammo and extort people for cash rewards. Also early on you get the minigun and soon after you can go for the junk jet for ammo consumption. Build up settlements early to open up trade routes. High INT will help you craft grenades with chemist and set you up for power armor by end game if you choose. Early on rely on armorer and gun nut as well. Strong back will be necessary mid game to carry a full arsenal of weapons like the fat man and missile launcher. By end game I think the high strength with gun bashing could be helpful at close range or just use a flamer gun bashing will be good on ammo and work with your high armour and strength. I played as a stealthy sniper the first playthrough so for this build Im doing the exact opposite with AGI and LUK at  no VATS. Rifleman I dont think is really necessary... An exploding minigun or something in that range will be way more menacing. You could also set yourself up for chem resistant as well so you can toss explosives and run and gun in slow mo as necessary.,Fallout4Builds,cxcxh6a,2,t5_3acsu

5819007,0,t3_3uqq5l,Probably go for moving target and maybe shotguns to get up in peoples face with. Also probably high agility and endurance so you can sprint a ton. This could be a pretty viable build if you focus on analyzing the environment moving between cover to keep safe then closing quickly on enemies to wreck with shotguns or a good cqc weapon. You could probably even figure out ways to drop down on enemies on some levels and catch them by surprise which would be fun.,Fallout4Builds,cxiehrq,2,t5_3acsu
5824385,0,t1_cxj15p3,Now that Ive played the game I can comment on it a bit...I ended up using VATS and stealth a lot so I rerolled in favor of at least  in agility and perception. I didnt find much use for the chemistchem resistant combo I dont like temporary buffs or Nuclear Scientist and Intimidation is a pain since half the time they just attack you and you lose the advantage of getting the drop on them. Scrapper was also a disappointment as it ONLY affects scrapping weapons and highlighting. Meh.With Intimidation and Nuclear Scientist both pretty meh I suggest  Int and  Cha. You can bobblehead em both up or wear clothing to boost them beyond if you want the full Velma look or as close as you can get go pick up the Armorsmith Extended mod off the Nexus so you can get a Ratty Dress and add armor layers to it.Definitely add Gun Nut to your build. Energy weapons are great but you cant realistically go monoenergy in this game. Armorsmith is also important but you can drop Strength to  and then use the baby book in Shauns old bedroom to raise it immediately.Fortunately Rifleman Lifegiver and Local Leader proved worth their weight in gold. Shotguns and sniper rifles both carry off Rifleman nicely. I added Demolition Expert and Commando in my s to add more options but Rifleman got me through most of the game alone.Good luck!,Fallout4Builds,cxj3okd,2,t5_3acsu
5852825,0,t3_3v70u9,also there should be a mention here of the math on lovers embrace. for plain int build with no idiot savant it is a simple  boost to exp gains... but for idiot savant rank  that is an extra  x. so lovers embrace makes idiot savant rank  even better than youd think. basically lovers embrace is similar to having  int but with the higher proc rate of  int... because you really only have  int. thats just an example. really just insert your int and add  but the proc rate stays because lovers embrace boosts your experience not your int!,Fallout4Builds,cxmu0lr,1,t5_3acsu

6068345,0,t3_3ymj7i,This should work but I wouldnt recommend it for a power armor build. Science scrapper and nuclear physicist are all really useful for full time power armor usage. If you want power armor I would at least recommend grabbing scrounger in the luck tree for more cores and starting endurance at  and getting it to  with the bobble. And even then with a VATS heavy build those cores will still drain really quick!Also... Good news this is  points you have  to spend!  with bobbleYou have  options in my opinion. Put the last point in luck and at least grab scrounger OR this is my recommendation leave END at  and put  points you have to spend in INT for nuclear physicist with a bobble as well as science. The extra DR will make up for the missing endurance plus youll have access to medic too which is one of the most underrated survivability perks. Seriously... Its like the best tank perk out there!Then use the book to boost your END to  which gives you chem resistant which works really well with chemist in the int tree. Full time power armor use will also boost your str to  automatically and will make you a tanky killing machine!,Fallout4Builds,cyf1t3x,2,t5_3acsu

9802641,0,t1_dalct14,As a tremendous Westworld fan who isnt? my take on the Man in Black is Hes person of determination and efficiency who while perhaps weary of the traditional quests and scenarios still pays respect to the roleplaying and lore of the land.This is not his first time traveling through the wasteland. hes familiar with the important characters the popular terrain the powerful technology. This is not to say he takes the straightest path to the best rewards. Hes long grown bored with such tactics. He wants to accomplish his goal some esoteric quest ala the Maze by any means necessary while staying immersed in the world.I disagree with uMysticZephyr on a couple points about Gear.gt Perhaps Silver Shroud outfit with a switchblade and only using pistols ideally revolvers. I believe Nuka World has an old western revolver you can use.While I like keeping his Western theme intact I actually think hes essentially an immersionist. So while he may prefer the cold simplicity of knife He wields a huge Rambo knife a lot in the show so maybe a combat knife I dont think he should commit to Western guns per se but commit to Wasteland guns. For example a mm pistol or a pipe gun would be the quintessential handgun of the Wasteland not a Westernthemed revolver. I like uMysticZephyr s RP suggestion of smug indifference a sort of playfulness to his dialogue choices. However I dont see Man in Black as a sadist. He wouldnt merely take pleasure in causing the predictable yet amusing machines pain though he would resort to any means necessary however brutal they may to achieve his goals.I love uMysticZephyr s suggestion of Lady Killer perk but I dont think Lone Wanderer suits himhe seems to value bringing someone with him who is pertinent to the quest. So Id say use the relevant follower for the relevant quest then go solo if the occasion calls for it. ,Fallout4Builds,daldxaq,3,t5_3acsu
9995118,0,t1_db8hae3,Yeah that sounds like a fun back story for something like Frost. Ive been biding my time before installing it until it at least supports all the DLC.,Fallout4Builds,dbae4ec,2,t5_3acsu

10432805,0,t3_5pdjzk,My advice is if you insist on going wholly wacky playing as a Druid and spending all points on charisma intelligence and endurance and going with these perksAttack DogAqua BoyWasteland whispererChemistChem ResistantLead BellyRobotics ExpertAnimal FriendThe idea is to be able to use chems contantly to boost your own survival while wololoinginciting and using armored up Dogmeat to deal the majority of your damage while using chemist to make stims to revive him quickly should he fall.Keep a decently powerful pistol both for inciting as well as self defence as well as some HalluciGen and cryo grenades for spell debuffs.,Fallout4Builds,dcqmm2i,4,t5_3acsu
10934240,0,t3_5vdga0,Ill just add that this is an extremely useful resource on how Int and Idiot Savant interact for experience gain    TLDR   int with rank  idiot savant is the best easily sustained exp farming available giving an average of  increased exp. To get comparable  better with high int youd need  intelligence.  Its ALWAYS better to have Idiot Savant regardless of how much int you plan on having but max exp gain for least investment is  int with Idiot Savant rank  or . The problem that you run into when doing a  int idiot savant based build is that some of the best perks are up there in the int tree. Specifically Medic Gun Nu Scrapper Science and Chemist. Ironically this would require you to get  int which is actually the worst amount of int to get if you are going with Idiot Savant as well. That said its only a difference of about  exp. That may sound like a lot but the ability to break down weapons and craft anything in the game will make up for it and remember that crafting will be a significant amount of your exp when you are going medium  high int.  As a veteran of FO with over  hours played Ill also point out a few things   It depends how you play but if your goal is to make the most powerful character ever just realize that there is no level cap in FO and on Survival Mode I reach level  with ease before even getting to the expansions. Some of the best perks in FO are not combat related. In fact the most essential perks IMO are not combat related at all. Almost all of the crafting perks are worthwhile although some are more vital than others depending on what game difficulty youre playing. You could of course entirely ignore the crafting pick up a sledgehammer and just bash enemies brains in. That is  viable and with a sneak attack  vats  blitz based build you can easily do melee sneak attacks by end game that will one shot anything. ANYTHING. Were talking in excess of  damage per swing on a sneak attack. You could also ignore VATS and perception completely and manually aim  swing. The advantage there is that you free up SPECIAL points from agility and Perception to be used elsewhere. Its all viable and Fallout  is a pretty forgiving game even on survival mode. The main thing is to get around  toughness so that you can shrug off most small arms fire. Now if you want to be able to tank a rocket or mininuke to the face you need power armor. ,Fallout4Builds,de7sgan,2,t5_3acsu
