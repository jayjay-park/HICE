Doesnt mean youre squatting incorrectly it just could be something you want to work on after you work out. Its also different with different types of squats. Highbar squatting involves being very upright and your hips have to be very open to get down in a squat position with out folding your torso forward. For a low bar squat your hips do not have to be as open as hinging forward is part of the squat.,xxweightroom,ci72ewg,2,t5_2yxyg

9036613,0,t3_53yyfq,Two weeks is very little. I would deload  if you were doing a linear progress program and just get back to it. Ive had to stop working out for several months in the past and while cardiovascular capacity was much reduced I was able to get back to my old lifts within a few weeks to a month. ,xxweightroom,d7y235j,3,t5_2yxyg
