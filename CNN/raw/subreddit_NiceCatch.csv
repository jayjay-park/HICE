In the NFL you have to maintain clear possession to the ground no bobbling or juggling the ball.In this case he held onto the ball without it moving or hitting the ground so keeping clear possession and touching both feet in bounds prior to going out.There is a third component that comes into play when a player transitions into a runner via a football move whether the dropped ball becomes a fumble or an incomplete pass but that doesnt apply here.And before you say it yes the rule is needlessly complex as well as difficult to call correctly even with instant replay. Theyre going to work on it once again this off season.,NiceCatch,cytjju5,1,t5_30n9y
