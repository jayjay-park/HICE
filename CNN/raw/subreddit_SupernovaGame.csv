4744199,0,t3_3fw7b1,I think competitive play will be interesting at the very least. Seeing all the different strats and builds will be pretty cool as there are so many different possibilities each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps before competitive play there should be a division system? Something similar to the likes of League and Dota.,SupernovaGame,ctsjulz,3,t5_3776o

7254672,0,t3_4df3jr,I just got into League started around  months ago and honestly its just frustrating to play. The community is saturated and toxic that every time I play I never have fun. Its a shame since I even bought champions and some skins too but I dislike the game.When I saw this game I was immediately interested. I had a closer look at the gameplay aspects and the game really appeals to me I feel like this new game will be so much fun for me and better to play.Honestly I really want to be a part of this game and play it forever it just looks sooooo damn good. Hopefully itll be popular on release.TLDR I am very interested in this game huge refresh from League.,SupernovaGame,d22syui,1,t5_3776o
