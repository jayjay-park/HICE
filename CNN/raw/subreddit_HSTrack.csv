696332,0,t3_22257m,Lmaoooooo Track is athletics.  raw and harvested power and determination. Skill and athleticism are completely different things. You still train for both. Dont let this fucking cunt try to say shit. Most sports are equally balanced or at one endthe other of skill and athletics. You cant be good at soccer if youre slow but have a ton of technical ability just like you cant be super fast and really shitty with the ball. I have respect for any athlete that doesnt bash another sport and sees an athlete as an athlete not a pussy. Good luck with your  Track and Field season fellow runner!,HSTrack,cgjfb9w,3,t5_2v35t

3152219,0,t3_2w8fw1,I suspect every states rules are different.  Oklahoma just recently had a rule change made specifically addressing this point.  Its unofficially called the Gunner Nixon rule.  The rule used to state that each team was limited to ten meets.  If an individual on that team competed unattached at an event it was still considered one of the teams ten meets.  Gunner competed I think at  meets unattached but took himself out of  of the ten meets his team was scheduled for.  He and his coach thought this was how the rule read.  Technically though his school competed in  meets that year.  Lots of bitching and moaning ensued. The rule was changed to what I think it should have been to begin with so that in the above case both Gunner and his team would have been in  meets.So...  I would check with your coach.,HSTrack,cooq45z,2,t5_2v35t

4331443,0,t1_csdd3ov,Hey Jack! Thanks for the question. I actually had to answer this question for our senior banquet two weeks ago but Ill try not to regurgitate the same response. My favorite moment will probably never change but my favorite race is kind of flexible and I might choose different races depending on how I feel at the moment.Id have to say that right now the favorite race but not my best race per se that I participated in was the K at New Balance Games this winter. I had never raced a K before and I like NYs oddball indoor distances because I think it takes the thoughts of time out of the race and allows you to just compete.So keeping this in mind I wanted to make sure that I got in a heat with my three training partners so we could finally test ourselves headtohead at this new distance. The heats were pretty big and anyone whos raced at an Armory invitational knows how much of a mess the seeding process can be so what ended up happening was my training group got put right on the break between two heats. I tried to pull some lastminute bib trading but it didnt exactly go to plan and I was stuck running the race with the thenslowest member of my training group at that point I thought I was a big shot and had the fastest mile PR so I was hoping to win it amongst them with the other two members being in a faster heat.At that point I changed my goal from beat my training partners to win the heat assuming I would easily beat the one training partner that was in my heat. Going under  would have been nice as well.So I went out really aggressively thinking that I had to be in the mix early on to win it. I came through my  feeling OK and I thought I almost had a kick there for a moment but as usual it wasnt quite enough to catch the lead and soon second place blew by me as well with m left. I thought I was going to have to settle for rd and pushed it in with everything I had.Then the unthinkable happened My slow training partner blew by me with m to go. I tried to react but his turnover at that point was just unreal. His mile PR was barely under  at the time but he finished the K in  low for rd giving me a final time of  for th place.This race in itself wasnt all that special but it was pretty cool that both me and my partner in this race ended up beating both of my training partners in the next heat timewise despite being in a slower field. This race marked the beginning of a new block of great races for my friend as he went from a maybe   from last year to splitting  on our divisions x to win it and running  in the . I love it when the unexpected happens in races even if sometimes that unexpected happens to beat me.Ive got to go for now but Ill update favorite moment in a few hours!,HSTrack,csdvsoy,2,t5_2v35t

6740027,0,t3_47zi35,Mostly pertaining to the  race that was my main event in high school and college Do you run drills where you jump over one side of a lane with a few hurdles with one leg right side of the hurdle for left leg vice versa at race height? Seems like that could help some.   As for the fear at racetime it may take some building confidence in your ability to make it over in the race setting to start working past that. Falling can hurt and can be a bit embarrassing in the moment to be honest Im not entirely sure how I got over it myself. The more you practice and achieve the less scary the hurdles will be and you can turn more attention to form and speed.   And to be on the safe side work on rhythm endurance to fend off fears of form breaking down later in the race. ,HSTrack,d0gh67f,2,t5_2v35t

11487050,0,t3_630fzb,Howd I miss this?m open at my senior year state meet. Two guys had been duking it out all season for the top ranking they were both pretty consistently hitting mid s with PBs of low . Everyone else was hovering right around two with only three or so guys having gone sub for the season. Id been overtraining like an idiot so I never raced on fresh legs and despite hitting  the previous season I hadnt cracked two until the day before as the anchor in the x. Pretty sure I was seeded around . good for the seventh seed.Gun goes off we make it to the first straight everyone is shoulder to shoulder. Like in a wall across all eight lanes. We reach the first bend and people are all the way out in lane four. The majority of people backed way off the pace after hitting the  and I wasnt about to get stuck in traffic so I broke one of the cardinal rules and passed on the outside on a turn in lane five. I got a m lead on everyone including the top two guys and crossed the  in  flat everyone else in . Ridiculously slow for a state meet with a couple  guys.By the  mark I had m on our one and two seeds and I later learned they thought I was gonna leave them all in the dust and take home the gold. If only. They both accelerated at the same time and reeled me in by the  mark then I started to really pay for that second  and I dropped back to sixth by the finish. I crossed in .XX cant remember what but I was pissed. The winner the first seed ran a low  splitting  the second seed came in a tiny bit behind him. Negative splits in the  are almost unheard of let alone in a subtwo performance at a state championship meet. Wound up having  all run subtwo which is definitely unheard of at the A level in Oklahoma. Usually a subtwo guarantees a first or second place finish.Wound up with a crappy finish but at least I got a fun story. Meet wasnt a total bust I salvaged a rd place finish from th in the x and I also got sixth in the  and x so I medaled in everything. No outstanding performances and my times were pretty rough but I had fun with it.,HSTrack,dfy20le,5,t5_2v35t
