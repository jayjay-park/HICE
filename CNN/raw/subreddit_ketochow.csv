I just had the chance to try it and would not recommend it.  The texture is beyond gritty and the flaxseeds get stuck in your teeth as you drink it leading to the need to floss immediately afterwards.  In terms of flavor I didnt notice anything noticeably different.  Side note Always be shaking your drink and jug before pouring as flaxseed settles fast.The note of possibly replacing fish pills seemed interesting to me as the cost basis on Flaxseed is lower than fish pills from what I can tell.  Interestingly enough replacing fish pills with flax seed wouldnt skew your omega ratios from what I can tell.  reference,ketochow,dehhnzv,1,t5_3bjok

I drink one for breakfast and usually lunch and dinners are protein heavy steak sausage chicken etc. with butter andor salad with olive oil based dressings went from  to  with no calorie counting.MCT is just a uber healthy fat source. i recently stopped using it and replaced it with the additional cream.Fish oil get it where ever you like. On a keto diet many people lose their neccessary omega  sources unless they ensure they eat salmon a couple of times a week. Omegas are prevelant in corn but thats a nogo on keto.And most of all Keto is a lifestyle and get educated on gaining muscle aka lean muscle mass in Keto. short answer is you DONT need carbs. reddit ketogains FAQ to learn all about it.,ketochow,df9yheq,4,t5_3bjok
