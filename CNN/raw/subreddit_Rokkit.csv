4549463,0,t1_ct3xogl,Ive been debating this model as well. Im actually going to have a conversation with a business owner  friend of mine either this week or next week to see if there is some sort of grunt funded model we can do with the development  art work. I would love to incentivize this if we can come up with a solid business plan for contributing members.If you have any ideas as to a good business model let me know!,Rokkit,ct430px,1,t5_2x7cb
