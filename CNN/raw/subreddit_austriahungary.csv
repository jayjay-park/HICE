6021518,0,t3_3xu7bu,Ok here we go. I used a different base map because I couldnt edit the svg and the second one was low quality. So let me explainThe central area is Austria which roughly corresponds to the areas claimed by the Republic of German Austria It includes the Sudetes mainly because due to the free movement in the empire it doesnt make administration that big of a problem.Then theres Czechia centered around PrahaPrag and Moravia centered around BrnoBrnn. These will be the national states of Czechs and Moravians respectively.To the south theres Trent which is an Italian region and theres also a Ladin region centered around CorvaraThe Slovenes have their own state too which includes the eastern side of Istria TrstTrieste and GrzGorizia and the capital is LjubljanaLaibach. The western side of Istria is part of an Italian state with its capital being Rovingo.The Poles live in West Galicia capital KrakwKrakau the Ukrainians in East Galicia capital LvivLemberg. East Galicia also includes northern Bukovina with Czernowitz. Southern Bukovina is its own state capital Suceava.Now for Transleithania. I left Burgenland in Hungary. The main reason for this is that Germans in Hungary Swabians arewere generally happy with the state of being there wasnt really a separatist sentiment for them. I left Prekmurje Vends in there too because they have a differentish culture and language from the rest of Slovenes but the question is open for them. In BcskaBaka I made an autonomous state mainly because its a clusterfuck of Hungarians Croats Serbs and even Slovaks and Rusyns. The capital of Bcska is Novi Sadjvidk. Banat is also a state on its own capital TemesvrTimioaraTemeschwar.Transylvania is another big state capital KolozsvrClujKlausenburg. There are ethnic lines drawn in case there were ethnic clashes or similar it can be further divided if necessary. It also includes some of Partium up to a line of AradNagyvradSzatmrnmeti but it doesnt include these cities.Hungarys northern border corresponds to the line drawn in the first vienna award in . It includes KassaKoice because the city itself was Hungarian majority at the time.There are two more states Slovakia capital Bansk BystricaBesztercebnya and the Rusyn state capital KhustHuszt.There are also  free cities on the map PressburgPozsonyBratislava and FiumeRijeka. These dont belong to any other state and govern themselves,austriahungary,cy8y0i8,3,t5_31zn5
