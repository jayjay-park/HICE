4880074,0,t3_3hp6do,Awesome. I have no problem with a regular mask and snorkel buy my girlfriend for some reason really struggles with it for some reason. Ive seen masks like this but could never find a retailer that sold them. I assume you are the amazon vendor?,snorkeling,cu9o5yh,1,t5_2zqai
7136791,0,t1_d1pdg6t,Thanks. Yea I love snorkeling when abroad as I dont need a wetsuit but since Im from Ireland you can imagine I need one all year round! Im quite a light person at  pounds and with all the gear Im very buoyant. So I was thinking kg will probably suffice. Ill test it out in shallow water first anyway to be on the safe side.,snorkeling,d1pdin3,1,t5_2zqai

9810819,0,t3_5fl6sy,Hey there I live in Miami and have snorkeled around the Caribbean quite a bit. One of the best spots Ive been to is Dry Tortugas National Park. Theres a boat that leaves from Key West that takes all day trips and theres also an option to camp on the island. Its on of the most beautiful and interesting and beautiful spots Ive been to. And of course Key West is a beautiful place as well. You can easily avoid the tourist areas Duval st. by staying on the east side of the island or another one of the keys. Another option is John Pennekamp State Park off the coast of Key Largo. This has the nice benefit of being only an hour or hour and a half drive from Miami. You can drive right past and forget about Miami since it seems like youre trying to avoid that scene anyways because the airport is well outside the city. There are tons of boat trips that take you out to dive. Theres also some small beaches with plenty of life right off the beach that you could snorkel by yourself on your own. Key Largo has the benefit of being much less developed and more casual than Key West. Both options are beautiful and very accessible via your flight options. But those are  of my recommendations.  ,snorkeling,dame6ed,1,t5_2zqai
