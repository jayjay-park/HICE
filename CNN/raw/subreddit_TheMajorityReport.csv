4775639,0,t1_ctwi9bi,History Equality Property and MarriageMost American treated married women according to the concept of coverture a concept inherited from English common law. Under the doctrine of coverture a woman was legally considered the chattel of her husband his possession. Any property she might hold before her marriage became her husbands on her wedding day and she had no legal right to appear in court to sign contracts or to do business.
