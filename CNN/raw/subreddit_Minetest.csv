6412683,0,t3_43hfs2,gtno way of launching carts need to manually push them then hop in no switches to send mesepower to release the brake track or  will provide compatibility with mesecons.gt MOBs cant ride in minecartsThis is possible but would require the mobs mod to detect and use carts.gt carts pass through MOBs no interferenceI think this would be extremely laggy.gt carts are stuck to rails cannot fly off the track if the track suddenly ends at a ledge for exampleThis is also impossible to do without extreme lag.,Minetest,czik2lf,3,t5_2twxh
