3114109,0,t3_2vt86n,Once you spawn? Thats a bug thats been in for a while that your fps suddenly drops massively on spawn occasionally. Just relaunch the game or deactivatereactivate VSync in settings Ive heard.If it gets really choppy in hangar now which is a feature of the latest patch yesterday you need to add    noddexas a launch parameter for the game.exe. Steam has an option for that somewhere but you can just create a shortcut to the game and add that seperated with a space to the target field in its property dialog. Should look like this,StarConflict,cokrz7i,4,t5_2u8e7

6376650,0,t3_42zzlr,gt Is maining Engineering Frigates at all viable in the context of reaching the end game or are they generally a subpar class?Viable anything is viable. But you usually want to have all four of your slots filled to be more flexible and in the CTB mode you might need all four. It also doesnt hurt if you get proficient with all classes easier to counter them that way.gt Can I order the drones to stay in one place and for example guard the beacon? Ive went through the keybindings but were unable to find anything that would resemble this. Im up to Raptor mk. if this changes anything.Nah the drones orbit you.gt For all I know Empire is by far the most OP faction. Should I stay in the Empire and play Federation Engies switch to Federation and play Federation Engies or stay in the Empire and go for Empire Engies?Play whatever you like. But I suggest you branch out to every faction you get some advantages which I cant recall right now but I know I had some headache because I still dont have a r Empire ship.gt Are there significant differences between playstyles of Federation and Empire Engineering Frigates?Definitely. Empire ships usually tank with hull. They are beefy and strong and slow. Fed Engies are faster more like an ambulance than a stationary safe space. Also can use adeptive tanking more effectively.gt What should be my playstyle? If possible I try to keep in close second line provide support fire throw down healing buffs and if domination defend the beacons we have captured.Keep doing what you are doing. For Empire Engies thats perfect.gt Are there different kinds of drones? In one of the threads here there was a mention of rocket drones and attack drones. When do they become available? How can I choose what drones I use?Yeah you can craft drones that go into the missile slot. Also when you craft an Engie a rank ship at Federation you can select what kind of drones you want to have in the special slot.gt Are there some YouTube channels that offer good informational content for this game?Dunno. There are a lot of gameplay and fun videos not sure about any good tutorials.gt Where can I find secondary stats maneuvrability etc.? One wiki is in Russian the other is very incomplete and Im probably an oaf but I cant seem to find them in the game itself unless its like in WoT and there are some hidden stats.There is a setting in the game to show detailed statistics. The game then tells you the turn rates and strafe speed and energy regeneration and crit chance and bonus damage and resistances damage reduction and basically every relevant stat. I think its quite good.,StarConflict,czegeri,2,t5_2u8e7
6404258,0,t1_czhg3fx,Yes and Posis work the same way. Your crit chance is multiplied by the amount of charges you release meaning if you have a  crit chance and  charges youll have a  crit chance but only do the extra crit damage of one charge.This was done to make damage spikes smaller as opposed to having regular crit chance and multiply the crit damage instead.Relevant Dev Blog,StarConflict,czhlklg,2,t5_2u8e7

6534024,0,t3_452sf3, Replace the hull rep with the module that increases capacitor performances I dont remember the name but it is INCREDIBLE. And since you are Jericho  so shield tank  you have no need of hull. If your enemy gets through your diffusion shield and your normal shields you are probably already dead... Use crit chance ammo or the purple spread reduction ammo and then an infrared scanner in the CPU slot. High crit chance is always very nice with rails. Implants I would suggest            and I cant remember what each rank  is sorry  and  for extra damage as you have chosen. The  and  do not apply The energy recuperation system in the shield is useless. When you activate your diffusion shield this module no longer functions since the shield is no longer taking damage... You could use the module that doubles the capacitor volume instead! Or just go with a bit more regular tank and install a thermal resist or something. Active modules are fine for PVP and PVE but try and upgrade them as soon as possible. For PVP I would use the command ships special missiles. They act as a  second ECM stun that switches off all the enemys modules. Can be used in lots of ways for example stopping a guards pulsar and self heals stunning a tackler that has just tackled an ally and stop him for cloaking for a short period of time stop an LRF from reverse thrusting force a gunship to use his combat reboot leaving him vulnerable to ECMtackler... You may want a bit more speed from somewhere   is slow even with the graviscanner! Maybe from the engine slot or a lightweight hull in the hull slot or just try and max out the synergy levelsor even from a booster if you have loads of credits I think not D. Up to you!,StarConflict,czv653b,3,t5_2u8e7

But Playing with teammates is poison?  You have to be jokingThe best matches I have ever had and closest matches was a  man vs  man.   They were the best part of the game.

9688274,0,t3_5dtp8l,Almost all passive modules are good in their own way I think it is much easier to learn those modifiers on real example rather than a generic guide on what is good and what is not because all those modifiers really shiny and come together if you take into account different factors like faction role ship rank purpose and so on. Especially considering that each ship in higher ranks with plenty of passive slots can be split into  area  OffenceRaw defenceAgility  they serve different areas yet must supplement each other. Like if you are building a very slow frigate  it make zero sense to put very close range weapons on it.,StarConflict,da7a9t3,1,t5_2u8e7
