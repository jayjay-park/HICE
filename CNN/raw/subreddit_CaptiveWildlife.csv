116142,0,t3_1veumx,Dont Shoot The Dog by Karen Pryor. Love that book pretty much every exotic animal trainer I know has read that at least once.Wild Mammals in Captivity is a very helpful textbook. The AZA has a small set of species specific care guides that come in handy also.Cry of the Kalahari was a very good read and also had quite a bit of lion behavior in it.,CaptiveWildlife,cernmny,4,t5_2stm2

1321252,0,t1_cii71qm,Thank you for your comment. I dont know that fish and wildlife could do anything but I do think that perhaps if I contact them and start to research more on laws and guidelines it will help me understand what I can do to help improve the animals lives a bit more. Its a tough situation.,CaptiveWildlife,cii9al5,1,t5_2stm2
1353511,0,t3_29jroc,I was sprayed. It was before Krebaums peroxidebaking soda was well known so I was told to go to a drugstore and get a couple of boxes of Massengil douche powder. So I went trotting to the drugstore but I didnt want to stink up the place so I opened the door and asked for someone to come over. Naturally who came to help me? The  year old male owner of the drugstore who I had to tell Hi Ive been skunked. Could you bring me four boxes of Massengil douche? He found it very amusing.Massengil worked well but its off the market. The Krebaums formula works very well. For your clothes tho I would try the urine or skunk removers you get at a pet supply. Beware nothing may work on synthetic fabrics. I got most of the stench out of my jeans but my top had to be tossed. My shoes too. Edit wanted to add the place I work at now doesnt deal with skunks but if they did I would find myself a hazmat suit.,CaptiveWildlife,cilycil,2,t5_2stm2

3055565,0,t3_2v4nyn,Ive heard this as well. I personally think that there could be come truth to this. I think we have a lot to learn about housing elephants and other intelligent animals. Those that lived alone or with conspecifics they disliked may have died young due to negative mental state which then lead to poor health. I have a list of animals that I dont think should every be kept in zoos because I dont think we canever will be able to provide them with adequate care and because they are more suited to live in large sanctuaries rather than enclosures due to their social systemsmigration habits and elephants are definitely on my list. They are very social intelligent animals I believe their care could be very complicated.The information Ive encountered on elephant ages are from fairly recent studies so I dont think the data is simply outdated. There is probably a lot to this issue that we dont understand.,CaptiveWildlife,coeph1g,1,t5_2stm2

3473771,0,t1_cpcaj5k,I dont work in wildlife rehabilitation but I do work in a zoo. While out on the path one day a man approached and proudly told me he bought a pet raccoon for only !. He had pictures in his wallet and everything. Needless to say I was horrified. It is amazing how many people ask us where they can buy one of our animals because theyd like one for a pet. Or Id have another tell me they dont understand why I was telling them a sugar glider would be a horrible pet for their  year old when they sell them in the mallSometimes you just want to knock some sense into people but sadly cannot. Mostly because they wouldnt listen anyway and also I love my job and wish to keep it.,CaptiveWildlife,cpo8hhr,1,t5_2stm2
3620225,0,t3_31qvyq,Cant say Im surprised or that I disagree. I volunteered there in  and saw shady and terrible things. Its not as bad as other infamous zoos but if the black market accusations are true then this is a long time coming.However the tigers are not in the care of the monks. The monks interact with them all day but all husbandry is taken care of by staff. ,CaptiveWildlife,cq4xkml,3,t5_2stm2
7348007,0,t1_d2czj9x,Hollllllyyy cow! Thanks so much for the info. That is quite thick! What you mentioned with outbreeding is really incredible to me. Thanks so much. I do not work with tigers personally but I would check if some of my contacts would be interested in that part. Thanks D ,CaptiveWildlife,d2df23r,1,t5_2stm2

10326225,0,t3_5nupgt,TLDR We created a device that makes makes foraging for food in zoosanctuary settings more complex and rewarding for animals.We are the nonprofit WildThink and we created the Animal Vending Machine. With the Animal Vending Machine zoos and sanctuaries can create foraging opportunities better than ever before. This device enables animals to exchange tokens that they have acquired for food much like humans use money that they have worked for to purchase valuable items. To acquire tokens animals engage in mentally or physically stimulating tasks such as solving puzzles exploring their enclosure or using tools. This allows animals to choose which tasks they want to perform and when to trade their token in for a reward.Visit us at www.wildthink.org,CaptiveWildlife,dcej9r0,2,t5_2stm2
