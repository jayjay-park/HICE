3290426,0,t1_cp3anqk,Hold Tight is blowing me away the music and sounds send my brain drifting to this almost ethereal place. Lyrically I dont think its bad either some of my favourite M songs are lets see not the most lyrically complex things Ive ever heard Lucky Star Beautiful Stranger etc. Some of us do get a bit wordy when we start talking about Madonna and Im probably the worst offender in that regard. I figure that these threads can make room for lots of comments so why not? But brevity is the soul of wit.

5106732,0,t1_cv14cwh,Who produced Hold Tight has been one of the questions Ive had the longest this year and as much as I love it Im not convinced that she produced it solo no matter what she or the label says. Late last year before all the leaks and everything went crashing down pretty quickly Ryan Tedder was interviewed and was quoted as saying that he worked on at least one song but if you look at the producer and writer credits for the album his name isnt listed anywhere. HT has its own wikipedia page    possibly because its been released as a promo single in some European countries and reached some of those charts and in this article it says that one of the places the song was recorded was Patriot Studios in Denver which is built onto or adjacent to Ryans Colorado home. Theres just something about the production of that song it swells into this really loud but pleasing to my ears sound similar to the way Bitch Im Madonna Graffiti Heart or Addicted do. IDK and I have no way of proving this but Im inclined to think that she had help at some point of the production process and Ryan or whoever else may have done some of that work either removed their names voluntarily from the project or maybe got bought out?edit typo,Madonna,cv1jvyw,2,t5_2qr9l

6350742,0,t3_41fccf,For Miamis second show Ariana Grande was the Unapologetic Bitch link I read this blog sometimes called dlisted where the main ho writing for the blog Michael comes up with nicknames for some celebs. Madonna is Madge usually Mariah Carey is Mimi Gwyneth Paltrow is Goopy Prince Harry is known as Prince Hot Ginge Leonardo DiCaprio is DiCatchAHo etc. etc. Anyway he calls Ariana by the name Ariana Grande Latte which always makes me laugh.Also heres a review from bocamag.com link This review is for the first show on Saturday and it includes an interesting tidbit I had missed earliergt The final act of the night took the audience back to the s as Madonna hit the stage as a flapper in a nightclub and one dancer came out as Charlie Chaplins character The Little Tramp. Madonna covered both Edith Piafs La Vie En Rose and Marilyn Monroes Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friendin which DJ Khalid made a guest appearance and brought her diamondsas strippeddown versions before ending the show with Unapologetic Bitch.I added the bold.

6477140,0,t1_czp6qax,I just read that article and was going to post it here myself. I was debating what to use for a title... I think I had settled on something like Another day ending in the letter Y another Madonna controversy. Because luckily we dont have really strict rules like rnews that say it has to be the title from the article itself. I know why news does that but we are allowed to deviate and inject opinions or even hyperbole if we want to. Im also not sure I would have used the flair news despite the fact that the article comes from the BBC site since it falls under their own description blogstrending in the web address. Its fine as is please dont think Im criticizing you because Im just thinking aloud about it and youve got to be used to that about me by now. I hope?

A lot of the songs sound very samey and kind of blend into each other for me. I also think it sounds quite dated in parts.I think its definitely an important album in her canon. It was a HUGE comeback at the time commercially successful critically lauded. Vocally shes never been better or stronger.

11097937,0,t1_deoo84d,What I dont understand is why this guys kids were at an orphanage in the first place. If hes so concerned about his daughters being raised in an environment he approves of why the fuck wasnt he raising them himself? Men are allowed to raise their own children whether the childs mother is in the picture or not  and if the mothers not in the picture then the father should step up and do more for them. That makes all these comments look like he is attentionwhoring... and the DM is providing him a platform to do so in their neverending quest to knock Madonna down again.,Madonna,depxwlh,3,t5_2qr9l
11180797,0,t3_5zlp59,IMO... Certain parts of the media have been running Madonna down since her career started  years ago and for the most part she has used the negativity to promote herself even more turning it into a cyclical kind of thing that feeds off itself. It becomes a contest to see which reporter can write the most shocking horrendous shit about her but at the end of the day she can claim that theres no such thing as bad publicity and use it to raise awareness of whatever it is shes doing. Like her or hate her there are very few people who have no opinion about Madonna and shes withstood the slings and arrows for years now and it only seems to make her stronger. I hate to say it but I could make a comparison between Madonna and Trump in that way because it comes down to the publics perception of how the person being attacked responds to it more than whatever it is they did. Maybe its the NYC influence on both of them... New York is not for little pussies who scream. Which was one thing when Trump was just telling people they were pretend fired on his shitty reality shows because he was operating under the same Madonna theory in a way and countless other celebs but now that its crossed over from reality to goddamn REAL reality it becomes kinda scary. With the younger generation of performers they are finding it harder to shock the public the way that Madonna did. Maybe because she already did it all? Like the South Park episode Simpsons Already Did It. Adele is super talented and appeals to fans across generational divides by intentionally not courting controversy so her press coverage reflects that generally. But for somebody like Taylor Swift Katy Perry Ariana Grande or whoever else they would probably kill to get  the bad press Madonna has raining down on her just for walking outside. Because that kind of publicity cant be bought.,Madonna,dezbx30,4,t5_2qr9l
