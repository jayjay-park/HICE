What was their name? Oh yeah it was DeathAngel. I wonder what theyre up to now? You search online but only find their old work.

I have a lovehate relationship with the whole series and while I agree seasons  and  were better than  and  they where far from good in terms of writing and plot. The art and animation was spot on as usual thanks to studio MIR doing the amazing work they do but plots all felt kinda half baked and a lot of that had to do with the fact that they where made simply because Nickelodeon ordered more seasons not because the original writers actually had a story they wanted to tell.       with ATLA they came up with a universe they liked a story they wanted to tell and wrote  seasons based off that. with korra they originally only had  story they wanted to tell meant to only last  season or  episodes. It got popular and more seasons where ordered before the first season even ended. thankfully they brought in a larger writing team for seasons  so eventually got new likable characters and were able to salvage the series from being mediocre to being pretty watchable.       good is not a word I would use to describe the korra series though. ,ImaginaryCharacters,czgspv0,2,t5_2ss6r

If you put your sword over your shoulder while holding the hilt theres no leverage youd be holding up the heaviest end and wouldnt be able to rest your arm.And also I knew of using the hilt to smash faces lol. One of the inspirations of this was the first trailer for For Honor where you see knights doing that and also holding the sword like this after whooping some ass.
