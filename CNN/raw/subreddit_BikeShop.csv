2823543,0,t1_cnow5ap,I want to raise the bars up a little bit for my posture which means either new stem new bars or both.My current headset has pretty pitted races so I want to replace it.Since I am already replacing the headset and bars andor stem I figured I may as well go all out and rebuildmodernize the whole cockpit I already have my favorite shifters for winter new grips new brakes amp new brake levers. It is not a total necessity but it seems like it a nice and worthwhile upgrade.,BikeShop,cnp1465,1,t5_2s90b

3155599,0,t1_cooy94p,Not sure if theyre quite collectors item status yet but the frames have a cult following. They dont come up for sale very often and often go for a high price if condition is good and the buyer has been searching for a while. They are race tools with a CX pedigree and were fairly expensive frames when new. Ritchey catalog said they were codesigned by Tom Ritchey and Thomas Frischknecht. I spent about a year tracking one down then another few months finding a correct fork and built it with the intention to have a cool conversation piece while bringing up the rear at CX cat races. Its really just too big for me to race plus my priorities have shifted. I rode it to work a few times thinking I could use it as a gofast commuter but its not really suited to that purpose. So here it is for sale!,BikeShop,cop2qh0,1,t5_2s90b

3879873,0,t1_cqyisc1,Well it says OBO up there Folks are currently paying in the ballpark of  for used Mondonico Monostay framesets frame and fork in good condition. Some more some less. All of the components on this bike are newer than the frame some less than  years old. The cassette alone is worth about  new and its got a lot of life left in it. Add another  for a used Record Crankset. Another ish for the nice headset. The Phil Wood bottom bracket will last a very long time and its  new. Were past  now and I havent gotten to the rear derailleur wheels the Brooks saddle seatpost handlebar stem and pedals.Its a nice classiclooking steel frame made by a man who has dedicated his life to the craft and kitted out by someone me who wanted to do it justice.But again OBO.,BikeShop,cqyjffk,1,t5_2s90b
4100146,0,t1_crn465k,From what I can tell the Tempo is a step above the Prelude. The Tempo has full Shimano  where the Prelude has Shimano Light Action which is at their lowend. They both have very nice double butted Columbus Tenax steel. Here they are sidebyside If you push the first right arrow you can see the Tempo that I have in stock. I still havent ordered the replacement rubber hoods but the bike is ready to go besides that. I will try to get the photos up today.,BikeShop,crnn479,1,t5_2s90b
