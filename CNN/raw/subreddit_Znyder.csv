8095048,0,t1_d4pk7zp,Chris Terrio said that he considers MOS BvS and JL a trilogy. And I kinda love the fact that while Zack directed is directing all three he has a different DOP each one. It helps make each movie still gorgeous but different visually. ,Znyder,d4pyft9,5,t5_3f7ml

8745841,0,t3_4zs5rp,Like Zack said He wanted to make a familyfriendly movie but not that it just focus on children. Studio second guessed and so they probably toned down on the more serious stuff and tried to pander it to kids. The movie also suffered from cramming like  booksstories into one movie. A trend similarly seen in this years  DC films. Still enjoyed the movie. The animation is great and theres that Snyder trademark visual flair which is really surprising as only a few animated movies IMO really pushed it as a visual medium not just as a storytelling one. The song by Owl City was also great.,Znyder,d6yvtvb,3,t5_3f7ml

9174961,0,t1_d8ezd8e,Unfortunately he blocked me even though I never replied or tweeted at him. He said watching BvS should be considered a violation of the Geneva Convention which dealt with war crimes and other atrocities.,Znyder,d8ezsao,9,t5_3f7ml
