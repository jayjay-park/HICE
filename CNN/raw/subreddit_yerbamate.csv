3542039,0,t3_30tzj1,My brother brought me a gourd and bombilla from Bolivia. They sat unused for a couple of years. I had my gall bladder removed and after that my stomach was very sensitive and I always suffered after lunch.I was reading up about natural ways to deal with stomach issues and saw that Yerba mate was supposed to be good for that. I dug out my kit and started drinking. I sweetened it up quite a bit and severely overdid the mix at first large mate filled to the brim...I had the caffeine shakes every day.These days I drink it straight and I put much less herb in. I dont need it for my stomach anymore but its my ritual now. Plus it keeps me from sleeping at my desk.,yerbamate,cpw0jq5,1,t5_2ro1q

9780899,0,t1_dahj7f2,The only types of smokedroasted mates I drink are the type thats from Brasil thats sold under the brand Matte Leao but I buy it loose at a local place that sells Brasilian mates both green pure leaf and roasted pure leaf and Argentine mate canchada.Ive never had Pajarito Mate Cocido o mate tostado but Im guessing its similar to this?,yerbamate,daipkvy,2,t5_2ro1q
9955624,0,t1_db4ucns,Hes also very good about replacing any gourds that leak. Im on my third Quantum Cup Original after the first two cracked and leaked. Hes also got some pretty good sales if you subscribe to the newsletter. Sure you pay a premium for Circle of Drink products but they actually back them up. You can get a lot of the same bombillas from matea.com and goyerbamate.com if you want to do some price comparisons.,yerbamate,db58r14,6,t5_2ro1q
