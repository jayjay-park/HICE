3459002,0,t3_2zv1mv,The short answer is depends.Some people collect copper because they have a doomsday mindset and having dozens on pounds of nearly pure copper is useful. Others collect it because theyre betting that the penny will soon be demonetized and they can get the melt value which currently stands at . cents per penny nearly doubling the value. Of course it is currently illegal to melt down pennies.Some people collect to sell to copperhoarders which seems like a lot of trouble for very little reward to me. You have to factor in the time it takes to sort the coins shipping costs dealing with paypalscammy buyers etc. for at most .So the answer is it depends.,CRH,cpmjvb3,6,t5_2umi8
