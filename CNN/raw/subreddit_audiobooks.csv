Interesting premise lots of details about the main characters thoughts and motivations satisfying conclusion ie no loose ends. Thought provoking. No problem finishing this one.Still Follin em by Billy Crystal narrated by the author so all the comic timing is there naturally. Began to lose interest towards the end but not too bad. As is often the case with memoirs you want to hear about the height of their fame but they tell you more about what theyve done since. As a limey I dont understand baseball too well and didnt get all the references and characters.Liar and Spy by Rebecca Stead listened with yearold daughter in the car over several weeks. Much to maintain a grownups interest. Issues include moving house friendships bullying not being part of the cool gang. Daughter liked a lot despite not having a strong female character usual a problem for her.The Heights by Peter Hedges titillating to begin with ultimately became a bit tedious and ended up disliking the characters but not in a bad way!.

2119390,0,t3_2j72aw,Dont you love having a pile of credits you need to burn?I have quite a few scififantasy titles in my audio library. The narration is as important to me in an audio book as the book itself so all of my recommendations have topnotch narration.The Hobbit and LOTR Trilogy  No doubt you are overly familiar with these titles but the narrator is so freaking good it is worth revisiting the original source material. The narrator is Rob Inglis and he reads the story as if he were your favorite British grandfather sitting down with you to tell you a story.The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie narrated by Steven Pacey. This is an epic fantasy trilogy with some really memorable characters.The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern narrated by Jim Dale. This is probably one of my favorite audio books. Its a dreamy fantasy set in the real world. The story is very unique and you never quite know where its going to go. The writing is absolutely exquisite  Erin writes with such delicious language you can almost taste it and Jim Dale absolutely nails the narration.The Magicians trilogy by Lev Grossman narrated by Mark Bramhall. These books have been described as Harry Potter for adults its a fair comparison but IMO sells them short. There are familiar trappings but Grossman has a hell of an imagination and he has the language skills to do it justice. Once again fantastic narration.Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice narrated by Simon Vance. Im sure youre familiar with this material. I had never read the books and only picked them up on audio because Simon Vance is one of my favorite narrators. They are long and will keep you busy for a while but both the writing and narration are excellent. If you like the narrator he also narrates the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was amazing at it.Also if you are a fan of Stephen King audio books you might want to try books by his son Joe Hill. Im just wrapping up NOSA and its great. It has all the hallmarks of a great Stephen King novel.EDIT formatting,audiobooks,cl97y2a,2,t5_2qqq5

2946385,0,t3_2tf3t1,Im listening to Elantris by Graphics Audio! And their dramatization is SUPERB. I had wanted to share it with everyone but of course it seems like everyone already knows about it  it took me a couple hours to realize but part of why the acting is so seamless is because GA out the he said she muttered he groaned bits instead incorporating those aspects into the audio itself. Does that make sense? It really does feel like a movie in your mind. It is everything that I wished the Dune audio book would be. I really enjoy the story as well. I read the Mistborn series and enjoyed that which is why I gave Elantris a try. I think Brandon Sanderson is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. The idea of fallen gods and defiance in the face of defeat are really powerful to me. I find myself wanting to be more like the Prince!

Based on what im hearing I think Ill read some of the detailed chapter by chapter synopses Ive found online.  If things dont pick up then Ill do so until Sanderson takes over as Ive always appreciated his writing style.  I think Im also suffering from a change of gears too.  I just came off reading Abercrombies The First Law Trilogy  and the lack of swearing sex and violence have made this series even slower then it normally would have been.

4898195,0,t3_3hyhfr,American Gods by Neil Gaiman and read by a full cast. Neil is one of my favorite writers but I didnt really love this when I read it over ten years ago so I thought it would be good to revisit as an audiobook. The full cast does a great job I liked the main narrator and the two main roles of Shadow and Wednesday were well done. Shadow in particular is a hard role since the character is such a cypher. Neil himself reads the interstitial stories which actually take up a lot more of the book than I remembered. Its still not my favorite Neil book but I definitely enjoyed it more as a full cast production.The Botany of Desire by Michael Pollan read by Scott Brick. Covers four topics  apples a lot about Johnny Appleseed tulips tulipmania and the nature of beauty marijuana history of the plant and drug use potatoes Irish lumper and Monsanto bt GMOs. I found the tulip section too abstract and I enjoyed the more sciencefocused sections with marijuana and potatoes. Theres a lot of cool information in this book and Id recommend it for anyone who likes nonfiction. Scott Brick is a pretty good narrator for this material.Also a few weeks ago I listened to Go Set a Watchmen and just wanted to add how impressed I was with Reese Witherspoons narration  Id definitely vote for her for the Audies this year.,audiobooks,cubyfpd,3,t5_2qqq5

7936844,0,t3_4nz03g,Most books need to be listened to at  increase in speed. There are very few books have I listened to which required more none or less one or two than that standard range. I think audiobook narrators have a standard to try to reach an average words per minute so the average person can listen and comprehend what theyre saying. I think the standard should be raised  since I have to go to almost every book to increase the narration speed to   or  faster depending on the narrator.Anyway I answered your survey at . speed since thats the closest average for my listening.On Android Smart AudioBook Player is the best thirdparty app for listening to audiobooks. You can finetune playback speed like on Audible though only in tenths not twentieths like Audible and my normal setting there is .x since you cant make it the . faster and .x is sometimes too fast make bookmarks set sleep timer. Pretty much everything Audible can do but it works with audiobooks from any source including Audible if you download it to your device.

8110008,0,t3_4qam8w,Purgatory  Book  of the Purgatory Trilogy by J. Costa  is probably the best one and new favorite that Ive come across. The way Costa made it is insanely cool. The entire audio book has sound effects for everything and the story is intense. Ive listened to it several times. Its about a serial killer kidnapping a priest to help him find and kill other priests during the church sex trials. The serial killer is also very human as far as his emotions regarding a woman he is in love with. The characters are amazing and the scenes are chilling at times. Especially the Abramo segments. The first time I listened to it I felt like I had just walked out of a movie theater. His website says they are making a movie from the book. Im not surprised. Listening to the credits it seems that Costa did all the technical stuff in addition to the writing and narrating. I highly recommend it!,audiobooks,d4rmz3z,1,t5_2qqq5

8860462,0,t1_d7cvva0,Even Terry Pratchett has said to not start at the first book just because he was still finding his feet as a writer. The overall world is split into several story lines which read as mini series consisting of the same characters with a little bit of overlap. Guards Guards! is the first book of the Night Watch series. And Small Gods is a highly regarded standalone book. And They COULD be considered young adult but they often deal with plenty of heavy topics albeit in a pretty witty and sarcastic way. I am NOT a fan of the YA genre really at all. I read alot of pretty dark shit. And I LOVE discworld. The dichotomy is kinda hard to explain. They arent super violent or dark but they deal with all that stuff and general human strife in a subtely humorous and sarcastic tone.

But theres a big difference between a missed error and a pattern of poor judgement ... sometimes I hear narrators who work a bit too hard at finding emphasis in every line and it inevitably sounds wrong more often than not. ,audiobooks,d980wo6,5,t5_2qqq5

For the record though I think A Slow Regard of Silent Things is better read than listened and it is one of few books I absolutely feel this way about.

Ive been in a nostalgic mood so thought Id give it a try listening to it.  The narrator is not the worst that Ive ever listened to but she manages to make it sound like a simple throw away young adult novel.  I know it was a young adult novel but it touches on serious and IMO particularly relevant subject matter.  The narration sounds like something akin to Twilight... which I mean as an insult.
