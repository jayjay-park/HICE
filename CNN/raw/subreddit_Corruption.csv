5023772,0,t3_3jiwk4,This is an interesting story that completely lacks any meaningful reference points.  Take your pick between lazy or politically slanted. To put it on the map the cost of the stadium is roughly the cost of art in Milwaukee. m for k population means that The cost of having a sports team in Milwaukee is about  per citizen over a  year period.  That is without any earnings back to to community.  I assume that local contractors build this employees pay income taxes so knock  off of the m BEFORE any other taxable revenues are generated. So thats  per person per year across a  year timeline MAXIMUM.  IF the authors estimated overruns actually occur.   If not its  per person. The players in the stadium are taxed vendors are taxed bars and restaurants are taxed too but forgetting all of that I am more than willing to have  of my ANNUAL tax dollars go to a professional team that provides entertainment across most of the year. Comparatively the annual budget for art in Milwaukee is  per citizen.   In addition there are individual donations which are tax sheltered so the actual cost is higher.   And this is just the current number.  The art budget will increase the stadium costs are upfront.   So during the next  years the cost and revenues of art vs  the Bucks should about even out. No outrage? Why would we want to subsidize art at the obscene cost of a sports stadium?The answer is that the numbers in the article are meaningless in the context presented and that both art and sports offer something intangible and meaningful to the community. If you want to report on something meaningful focus on that prison thing at the bottom.  Wisconsin is paying  per citizen .b on prisoners today and that is projected to double within  yearsFYI  I am not a Bucks fan.  ,Corruption,curk0r6,0,t5_2qlpr
