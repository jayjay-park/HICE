687859,0,t3_221628,The submitter of the removed post submitted a post here before the bot was able to post it himself. I already responded there and there is some discussion but I thought it should be here as well. Here is a link to the other thread below is an explanation about what happened.I know this is going to be a popular one to call censorship so Ill just explain it now. Please read the whole post before downvoting. Im trying to give transparency which is a big part of the point of this sub.This is a clear violation of rule . Rule  includes active politicians of the past  years and anything related to them including events prior to those  years. For example posts about obama when he was  are banned. Posts about W. Bush are banned even from when he was . There is no ambiguity about if this post is in violation of rule  in that regard. Please see the wiki for clarification of rule . The sidebar can only fit so much.On top of that this is clearly related to current and ongoing political issues. To claim that the government spying isnt a current political issue is nothing short of lying. I do not believe anyone could say that and actually believe it. Some may disagree about if politics should be banned but thats a disagreement about IF the rule should be there not about if this post violates the rule. As long as that rule is there it will be enforced.Finally not all removal is censorship. If someone posts gore to fu and its removed is it censorship? No. Its rule enforcement. It doesnt belong there. Similarly politics does not belong in TIL. There are plenty of other subs for it. I know many of those subs suck but if rgore sucks does fu have to accept that gore post now? No. Because its not fus job to make up for the failings of rgore. Its not TILs job to make up for the failings of the political subs.If you think the political subs work well then post it there. If you think they dont work well then you can see why wed want to keep the politics circlejerk and flamewars out of TIL. Political posts do not lead to constructive conversation. If you want to have a better place to talk politics take it up with the political subs dont try to force TIL to be your soapbox.,undelete,cgiglzv,16,t5_2xv4u

Those powermods also operate rworldnews and seems to only be concerned about getting certain stories to the front page and holding mod status to themselves.  I wonder why they would do that...Then by desparation these junior mods turn to automatic filtering to try to mod the subreddit an idea they didnt even likeand also tries to add new mods from the community so they can get rid of the filter and this Creq guy appeas blames them for everything and when they get kicked off he says everythings fine and all the censorship is gone.  Did I mention that he claims to have the moderation logs of rtechnology and has so far completely refused to release it?  Then the powermods start banning people that call them out even mods from other subreddits.  Creq suddenly shuts up about rtechnology censorship even though I PMd him proof about it.You know what Im thinking? ...And of course clueless paranoid rundelete is harassing uagentlame and lauding this Creq guy when hes probably a sock of a mod trying to consolidate power.  I say rundelete is far too gullible and manipulatable unfortunately.  Though at least theyre calling out the new mods now.Unfortunately for you he is right.

However I dont feel like anything you are saying is going to change anyones view.Theres no reason for me to attempt to change anyones views.  That never happens on Reddit anyway.  I know that mods like you seem to think they can change someones view by using bans or censorship or by using a number of alts to attack someone who posts something you dont agree with or even using that same pool of alts to protect someone you are allied with.I understand that none of that really works the only thing it really does is make that mod and his pool of alts look like idiots in the eyes of those who have figured out what theyre really doing.The users of this subreddit want transparency in the modding of this sub especially when one of the newlyappointed mods has a history of bias.,undelete,cimzu9u,4,t5_2xv4u

This can be a good thing because voting and comments reach critical mass and the subreddit has varied coverage. When the OP decides to self delete a post it kind of screws with that system though. It would be a bad move to reapprove old posts because they have lost momentum and wont rank. So the best thing now is just for someone to submit another article covering that story and it might make the front page if voters are not bored of it now.This little episode is a good illustration of the power the users and not mods have to censor content and manipulate reddit.

Seriously they did not receive  million the weekend TheFappening was banned.This is ridiculously unrelated and quite frankly your title is just as much click bait than anything else.

You can view the deleted post on rundelete ltlink from two days agogt. The discussion was reasoned and highly personal and the source was excellent and on the front page of Reddit as rated by the community.gtThis is in my opinion behavior thats unbecoming of a default and would never have happened in the Reddit I once knew. Mods may police their subreddits as they please but admins may choose to demote default subreddits that engage in this behavior.

It feels like you do it because you want to and not because you have to. Therefore it takes massive will power to quit.

In this case one mod censored an article on a technicality while the other freely offered a place to freely discuss it. If free speech is the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint and one mod is censoring something that another allows then the other by definition is protecting free speech on his forum at least regarding that topic.We dont have a right to free speech on Reddit but we have a right to pursue free speech and complaining about censorship and the mods who censor our speech is a part of that.

3487175,0,t3_304uk6,gtSo we have a paradox accusing someone of being a shill without evidence is against the rules. Accusing someone of being a shill with evidence is against the rules.This is the state of reddit today. This is why reddit cannot and will never be a platform for activism journalism or investigative reporting. It is deliberately hamstrung and designed to be a repost market and advertising platform. Shills Look Mom! I said the S word! marketers PR reps corporations lobbyists amp propagandists operate with impunity and control content to a large disproportionate degree.To say nothing of anonymous mods protected by anonymous admins free to engage in pretty much whatever behaviour they like so long as they dont rock the boat and anger Reddit itself or large corporations or interests. Ive seen at least  subreddits that have removed downvoting via css. Ive seen at least one subreddit about a video game that is moderated by employees of the video game company. If members of a subreddit decide a topic is too popular or upvote or downvote it too much or do something the mods dont like then suddenly all posts on that topic are quarantined to a megathread that is separate but equal. Maybe criticism of a product in its subreddit is segregated to one of these megathreads because its a safe space for those feelings per the mods. Or you know it would be a real shame if your highly upvoted post were to... disappear for a while... until its off of the front page. Or maybe the subreddit rules are only enforced when it serves the purposes the mods desire. Or maybe people with an agenda will just hop on their alts and harass you to oblivion while getting paid for it if you dare to contradict their narrative. Its not like reporting them does anything and on the . chance that alt gets removed they have  others ready to go. Or maybe theyll just script a bot that automatically downvotes everything you do forever. Why wouldnt they? Its not like there are consequences for these actions. The fact that the np prefix for links exists speaks volumes about what Reddit really is. So its a site about links and posting content so it can be voted on and voting on content? Right? Except you cant post your own content or you get shadowbanned dont get me started about the fact that this even exists and if you link to content thats worth sharing youre obligated to ensure that people who view that content are excluded from participating in the voting process.Reddit is schizophrenic and hypocritical. At worst its the most effective propaganda machinecommercial hybrid in the history of mankind. At best its a wonderful thing where people can share and meet and learn. Its both. Theres lot of hyperbole among the factions and the little people will never know whats going on behind the scenes with the power players constantly jockeying for position but everyone can see reddit is more fucked up than it has to be. At the end of the day I try to keep in mind that its a corporation just like any other corporation Like the CocaCola corporation for example makers of delicious Coke Zero. Coke Zero Drink fresh! and I expect nothing better from reddit than from other companies. They will serve their selfinterest.It doesnt matter if Reddit stays or goes or if it gets replaced by something else because that will just become what Reddit is now. Reddit is the frontline of the new cold war the social media war with all the problems and implications that entails.,undelete,cpprhgi,5,t5_2xv4u

3525324,0,t3_30npqc,I think your suggestion is technically very good but I think youve missed one reason why it is important.I dont think the important issue is being allowed to post shitty comments I think the issue is that the opaque nature of moderation allows moderators to inject their own personal bias into the process.Only in the last few days have we seen mods shadowbanned for monetizing their subreddit and deleting dissent.  Those mods were stupid because their efforts to profit from their subreddit were obvious.Moderation is inherently opaque and I am sure that there are plenty of mods on reddit who have succeeded in monetizing their moderation without detection. I also wouldnt be surprised if many moderation decisions in supposedly neutral subreddits were applied because of idealogical rather than communitybuilding decisions.Where deleted comments are invisible it is difficult to show the existence of such bias as only a very small number of deleted comments are visible at one time.I like the suggestion of soft deletions except that I do not think these kind of deletions should appear in the sub.  People who wish to join brigades and witchhunts will just view all the comments anyway say horrible things to other people who have these comments turned on and can witchhunt away to their hearts content.Admins dont have the time to investigate personal abuse I dont think theyd go for anything which required their input beyond child porn and doxx.To be effective these soft deletions must be somewhat harder to read than normal comments to raise the barrier to entry for examining them.ugodfish has a bot which documents removed comments from political subreddits but I personally think the barrier to entry to discovery from these comments is a little too high.,undelete,cpu41ke,4,t5_2xv4u

4453901,0,t1_css1om8,Haha.  Thats always such a thoughtless insult Who gave you that idea?Its complicated.  The Ellen Pao hate is irrational sexist racist and inorganic.  The current wave is transparently led by problem moderators like karmanaut who has been caught using multiple accounts to puff up his moderator profile and justify his official decisions.  Im sure it has multiple purposes.  One very obvious avenue of intent begun over two years ago is a carefully considered effort to continually prune the website in order to promote commercialism and stem organic sociopolitical discussion.  The TPP is a big deal but the censorship over the last few years has inhibited the fomenting of various movements within our population.Basically they are so myopic as to be considered legally blind.  This kind of suppression will cause effective riots that are less lawless chaos than guerrilla uprising.  Apparently the privatization of society is made in a bad faith effort to remove the limitations of the constitution despite the fact that precedent has clearly demonstrated the similarly full length that its provisions extend into private business.  Of course the humanitarian parts of the constitution have been systematically gutted by governmentmilitarycorporate interests for decades basically ever since the civil rights act was passed.  Roger Ailes and his cronies are destroying the world and the US government left is all too eager to help.  Most demographics are aware of it at some level or another and many people are starting to realize that a willingness to give up their lives in a struggle for a better future is necessary to make the only moral choice left and fight.,undelete,css3j5d,1,t5_2xv4u

And that has influence on the stats.we arent that different there are less differences between a black dude and a white dude than two chocolate labs with different mothers. There is no special predisposition for violence or anything else in race.. race is mostly just a societal concept. you cant draw lines and say this is black and this isnt in science.. race just doesnt really exist.,undelete,ct5v9za,7,t5_2xv4u

It could be erroneously inferred by a reader that Comcast had  ownership share but this wasnt explicitly mentioned in the title  rather it simply read as owned which is technically correct as Comcast has a  ownership in each. . The thread was allowed to persist for  hours before being removed and received numerous tags before finally being taken down.

Even  years ago not very many people were taking advanced classes unless they were one of the nerdy or iv league level students but now they are pretty much required to take for the average student.

What you shouldnt say or think is that all muslims are like that  its a tiny tiny tiny minority.For example Im Irish and as a historical fact almost all Irish sex abusers in history have been white. Does that mean that Irish white men are all sex offenders or deserve a sex offender stigma?

They spent  years applying this strategy to Bill Clinton when he was president and came up completely empty handed. If all you did between  was listen to the screaming on cable news or talk radio you would have thought a criminal mastermind was running the country. But heres the thing it was all an act. It was a deliberate strategy to make Americans think that Clinton was corrupt. Unfortunately for Republicans however Americans did not fall for it and of course you cant prosecute someone for the bullshit made up by conservatives and Fox News.The same is what they are now doing to Hillary. The email thing is a complete non issue with the FBI director deciding that no prosecutor would bring charges for the trivial things they found in their extensive monthslong investigation. And the FBI directory is a farright partisan Republican. If anyone was going to find dirt on Hillary it was him. But he didnt. He concluded there was no crime she could or should be charged with. And thats the whole story. They have nothing on Hillary except the willingness of millions of Republicans to all pretend in unison that she has committed major crimes. Its an act. There are two types of Republicans Those who know its an act and go along with it to damage Democrats and those who believe it. I at least hope you are one of the smart ones who realizes what a bunch of bullshit it is.,undelete,d6l6zbj,-2,t5_2xv4u

9239677,0,t1_d8n5yct,gtI agree with you Hillarys plans seem far more concrete and seem plausible. Problem is when have the Presidents listened to their people? Or held up their end?It depends on many things such as the political climate opposition in congress urgency etc. When candidates make promises what theyre really telling you is what theyd like to do when they become president. Some promises fall through not because the candidate was lying although yes that happens but because they become apprised of so many things that they hadnt considered when making promises such as classified information. Obama kept  of his promises compromised on  compromise built this country and broke  gtI voted for Obama. Why you ask? Bc he promised to shut down gitmo. This is an example of a promise made with good intention that simply became very difficult to do politically. He still has time and they are trying. For more gtHe said he would protect whistleblowers where is Chelsea Manning? Edward  Snowden? His promise was not to protect whistleblowers with immunity it was to ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process. But youre right he has not held up that promise  although there has been some change through compromise gtThey all lie. Hillary is known to be a liar. Fact. Why would anything she says be taken at value? I dont listen to words per se I look at actions and how words match up with past actions. Hillary has done some questionable things for sure but her record is pretty solid on the issues I care about. And Bernie endorses her  yeah maybe just to keep Trump out of office but theyre voting record in congress lined up something over  of the time.gtShe lied to the FBI ffs. We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI Comey told House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz RUtah during one of the hearings opening exchanges.gtFortuitously for her the FBI is bought out by the same elite.

10077709,0,t3_5k4atc,gtThis happened a few days ago and Im still cringing. gtgtBack in middle school I had a wonderful idea. Every time I jerked off instead of using tissues i just did it onto the nice white carpet because I figured it wouldnt show up. It didnt! It blended in like a polar bear in the snow. gtgtLater more grownup and definitely not jerking off onto the carpet anymore I got another wonderful idea. I was hanging these little glowinthedark planets and calculating the exact distance proportion of course each planet should be from the room. After I finished my mother suggested that I use a black light to make them glow. gtgtHeres where the FU began. I got my entire family to come with me so I could show them the nerdy contraption I had hung from the ceiling. Using the black light I lit up the planets and held the black light facing the rest of the room. Then I realized my floor was also faintly glowing. Not completely. But it was. Faint dots glowed across many sections of my room. Panicked I tried to turn off the black light but I instead dropped it. My mother promptly picked it up got down on her knees to examine the spots. After a bit of confusion my brother started laughing and my parents slowly realized what they were looking at.gtgttldr Revealed cum stains on the floor for my parents to see while using a black light.gtgtEdit Ive seen people express interest for pictures Im actually out of the country for Christmas Merry Christmas by the way but Ill be back before New Years and Ill add it here then. Also made for a fucking awkward plane ride. We literally left the next morning. Pictures will be out on the st! Sorry!gtgtEdit  Also wow. You guys doubled my total karma  already and I havent posted the pictures yet. gtgtAlso if this shit isnt a black light then its not a black light. All I know is that my cum glows under it and it makes white things glow blue and some other things glow green. Im not a scientist.gtgtEdit  Yes I know semen smells. Ive never had as much of a problem with mine. Either way its been  years so the smell is long gone anyways. Stains definitely are though. gtgtEdit  final edit for the night. Late as shit  in NZ. Since a good deal of you think this is fake Ill post a screen shot of my phone connected to a foreign cell service not offered in the US and then another with verizon not offered in NZ plus Ill make sure to take the screen shots right as Im leaving so you know I was in NZ right before the st.

10157514,0,t1_dbvd187,Just me. Although if you send me your credit card details Ill convince other people to be more trustworthy. But seriously when it comes to scientific research if you want to know whats honest or not the only way to judge is to immerse yourself in it. First find articles on a topic that represent both sides. Then check their sources. Also check the studies funding and look the authors up on OpenSecrets to see where else they get money from. Do this for a few years and you start to get a sense for whats above board and whats not. Except information on the internet is becoming so controlled by moneyed interests that even this is becoming very difficult. Books are better but you need access to a university library.

11311048,0,t3_61fknb,gtThis happened several years ago around the age I first started discovering my body and all the crazy good feeling shit I could do with it. I was having a blast but I thought I could do better. I decided to look up masturbation tips on the internet. I came across a Cosmoesque article that detailed all the weird and wonderful ways to have an orgasm. One of the tips included putting a lick of minttoothpaste onto your clit and enjoying the tingling sensation itd bring to your most sensitive lady bit. I had toothpaste. And a vagina. And a complete lack of common sense or shame. I was ready to rock. gtgtNever being one for moderation I squirted out a decentsized glob of paste  the sort youd actually use to brush your teeth with  and promptly rubbed it directly onto my unsuspecting clitoris.gtgtgtWhat was once a pink pearl of pleasure became a violent screeching volcanic mound of absolute agony. Instant regret. I obviously rushed to the shower to promptly scour my downstairs of any Colgate MaxFresh remnants but the damage had been done. Fucking excruciating. My fun exploratory jaunt provided by internet advice on the possibilities of the female orgasm resulted searing pain only upped by the searing embarrassment that has clung to me nearly  years after the fact. gtgtYou know if you have sensitive teeth thinking about an iceblock can send a shiver down your spine? Well my sensitive clit wants to crawl right back up inside my body every time I stare too long at my teethcleaning implements in the bathroom cabinet. gtgtTLDR dont treat your vagina like a toothbrush. ,undelete,dfe38uz,2,t5_2xv4u

Here they acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and clearly caused a battery to the passenger.  Even if there was a clause in the contract it would still be suspect on a number of grounds.  Here there actions were not based on the passengers actions at all he was just randomly selected.  Bottom line is United will pay.

11700448,0,t3_66x95j,The threads been reinstated as utrobertson points out but those threads too big for me to ask a very general question wtf is up with StarCitizen? I hear so much about it and it seems like every month I see some very well produced fauxcommercial released by the developers telling me to spend like  USD to fly an ingame ship for a few hours. Is there actually a game? If you buy the prerelease and log in what can you actually do? And how much real money do you need to shell out to experience all the different aspects of the game? Ive felt like if you want to try everything as you would explore any game youd inexplicably have to spend hundreds of real dollars. Im not even sure if theres an ingame grinding mechanic to avoid spending real money.The games also been in development for at least five years...WTF is going on? Is it a real game? Whens the release date and why do they keep making really slick marketing videos about ships and ingame ship designers and such?I also get a Battlecruiser Millenium vibe from it with people saying you can do anything you want in the universe from being a space marine to a space pirate to a freighter to a trader etc. I need a super high level overview of whats going on.,undelete,dgm9j3e,2,t5_2xv4u
