473498,0,t1_cfu37zh,ampampamp Toxoplasmosis sfw gtToxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii.  The parasite infects most genera of warmblooded animals including humans but the primary host is the felid cat family Animals are infected by eating infected meat by ingestion of feces of a cat that has itself recently been infected and by transmission from mother to fetus. Cats are the primary source of infection to human hosts although contact with raw meat especially lamb is a more significant source of human infections in some countries. Fecal contamination of hands is a significant risk factor. gtgtImage iInteresting Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis | Toxoplasma gondii | Spiramycin | List of MeSH codes C Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfur oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfur.

He talks about it so much because hes obsessed with it. You guys udavidleclaire is an event promoter in the Seattle region that makes his income from spamming bar parties around the city. Sleezy type of guy. His business is really poorly managed and he mostly gets banned wherever he goes in most communities. Its not surprising whats going on here...the guy hangs out in rsrs and knows a lot about how to brigade and bring down subreddits. Hes studied and been obsessed with this shit for years and hes just applying the same bullshit gorilla warfare logic to the rseattle sub.Thats why I comment if Im not careless. Because you guys are bullshit and you pick on careless all fucking day long because  you think its funny to ruin someones life and  you want his ultimate downfall and you hope to position yourselves as the obvious successors.

But then we invented Western Civilization and we attempted to outgrow this.With varying degrees of success.But youre actively trying to ignore all that and promote racism in the guise of Western culture.Seattle is significantly not in favor of the policies your arguing and you probably know that but seem to enjoy the trolling and attention.  We need less racism around here but thanks to Trump you fucks think you have license to shine.  Dont bet on a long term success for it fucko.  We still outnumber you by a lot.
