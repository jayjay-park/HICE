3043009,0,t3_2v0imx,Im an UD player and scrimAT partner is an orc player so I know the match up fairly well. I dont necessarily know how good either of you guys are but these are a couple things that I can think of off the top of my head. A huge weakness of UD is their acolytes. If he doesnt properly block off his mine or build a frost tower your blademaster can kill acolytes with little trouble. This typically stalls the UDs Tier  while youve hopefully moved onto your tier .  an agressive voodoo lounge is nice for this kind of play.  Killing acyoltes while he is teching is HUGE as he wont make more acolytes to mine gold. If you know he is going to rush you then there is no harm in getting an early warmill and getting a tower up.  Raiders ensnare can bring wyrms to the ground for your army to attack.  Wyvern do well vs air if you mass some. Though i recommend going standard and having a few bats in your army. UD have no dispel at tier  so if you go for a tier  push there is no harm in buying a scroll of protection. Or even go shamanwitch doctor but I wouldnt recommend it.,WC3,codenz0,2,t5_2r4nl
3061717,0,t1_cofat00,Thank you for your reply.Yeah warena and wine do not get along well. I managed to install warena in wine using  prefix.

I have also seen on warena forums that other people have that problem too. I have only mint installed on my laptop atm and doing dual boot with linux installed first is not recommended. Given that I dont want to risk having to reinstall mint at this point...It seems I will have to stick with wine until I manage to get a windows installation sometime in future.,WC3,cofce8z,1,t5_2r4nl

3237719,0,t1_cowmkj8,I have to agree with KLG. I dont play a lot of Elf but i am working on a beginners Elf guide so ill include what he said in it.This is very similar to an orc playing an UD that never leaves their base. Heres what i usually do. Confirm that theyre mostly turtling. Usually a bunch of towers is your confirmation.. Creep a bunch of camps on their side of the map. Try to get all the orange ones. . set up some way to spot them leaving their base. Usually i make a peon patrol the  biggest paths out of their quadrant of the map and if they move out i attack them or their base. Wisps would work very well here. Also since youre going to have  expos and this is probably a low skill game you could probably just build moon wells  at the paths out of the HU area. Yea one of them might die but then if he stays to kill off of them you could fight at them and have heals. I imagine having a tree of life inbetween both clusters of wells. . Deny anymore enemy expo attemps.. Try to get  heroes to as close to  as possible. Its pretty doable really. Buy as many healing scrolls and invul pots as you can as well and dont forget boots. Get staffs as well. Get an orb on your DH too. .Build to counter what the enemy is building which is frequentlty T air.. If they never leave their base start sieging. I imagine thisll involve setting up APs and using chims. You could even setup moonwells. I hope this helps.,WC3,coxlhg2,1,t5_2r4nl

3999334,0,t1_crc3xa0,Short answer yes.  Long answer it depends on what your true skill level is.  If this is the first time youve ever played the game WArena probably isnt for you since it is a higher skill level.  Then Id suggest starting off on B.Net and watching replays etc.  However if youve played some and want to improve WArena is the best place to play.  Personally Im not very good at wc and dont play anymore due to time constraints. but I still greatly enjoyed playing on WArena.

5028557,0,t1_cus2uld,Other ideas  Tauren Cheiftan and cast Lightning sheild on him Shaman spell. Run into the ghouls and war stomp to stun. Also vs Fiends use speed scrolls to get close and war stomp.  Vs ghouls you can also use heroes like brewmaster and pitlord to severly weaken them with drunken haze panda spell and howl of terror pitlord spell. Use these two spells in battle in conjunction with spells like stasis ward Witch doctor spell and Spirit link Spirit walker spell. This will weaken the bots units while strengthening yours.  Orc is the best race to tower in with and tech. Dont build a barracks build a warmill instead. Make a few towers and tech immediately. Pick Blademaster as your hero and solo creep the map using items from the voodoo shop. At teir  build  beastiaries and mass wyvern riders with a kodo while upgrading ranged attack. BM plus wyvern can be pretty tough to beat if you attack right away with about  wyvern assuming you will focus fire units when you attack.,WC3,cus4s95,0,t5_2r4nl

7603320,0,t3_4jcoov,Hey bro im the player .. from one of the replays. First of all its very nice to see new players in this game this is something the community is missing. My first suggestion to you is to watch replays as much as possible to figure out every orc meta strategies units compositions vs every race. You need to learn the timing for every unit when to be train in the game for example the most standard orc meta is gt altar burrow barrack second burrow grunt voodoo lounge train last peon for wood to make  limit with ur BM and grunt when nd burrow is ready train nd grunt then save for tier ur townhall. Watching replays will also help you to see what creep spots to creep when you have Bm and grunt  grunts  grunts etc. Second make sure to learn all the orc hotkeys and learn to use them as much as possible this will make you play and react faster. And third watch streams. Lyn is playing almost every day FoCuS streams sometimes too. Grubby streams WC on the weekend evenings he also explains everything he do on english you can learn a lot from his stream i believe. In the end since you are beginner you wont have much fun on warena because the level there is higher than any other platform but if you want to learn this is the place ,WC3,d36gi6g,4,t5_2r4nl

10291182,0,t1_dca5jgi,i mean i went  on my main account and  with my new smurf... i feel like theres shit people on both teams really but the matchmaking is crap because everyone smurfs and lossbots so their skill levels arent evaluated properly by the system in the first place.Back in the day when i was lvl a lot of the top RT players were above . I never once felt i was constantly at a desavantage in terms of teammates. Sure the system probably puts the worst player on your team but the other team at least has the second worst on theirs. In a ladder setting where people dont stabsmurf all the time people have actually good evaluations of their skill and even the worst player isnt too far off your skill level.Yes some games will feel unwinnable but thats fine. Im sure some games you can play in solo feels unwinnable too. In the end v rt is a team game you alone arent the only factor in whether you win or not although by my stats you can see you can influence the game heavily if you are good enough..,WC3,dcak7t0,1,t5_2r4nl

11403020,0,t3_62p8xv,orc and undead require the most micro on higher level of play.tbh all  races require micro at a higher level of play.but orc and undead are the hardest due to the expensive units and importance of heros. losing  unit as a undead or orc is actually a huge deal. people will say coil nova and blademaster imba they probably just get stomped by better players and blame the race.losing a DK  time can decide the game just like losing a BM  time can decide the game. losing a grunt early game really fucks up a orc just like losing a fiend can really fuck up a undead. people just stare at the heros and think thats what makes up a race...but theres so much more to it.hu and elf require micro of course but you can make mistakes and still be okay.,WC3,dfoinpq,2,t5_2r4nl
