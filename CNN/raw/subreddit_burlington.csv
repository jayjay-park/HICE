Furthermore Im not sure the income generated by these jobs really create an economic feedback loop within the community beyond the meager salaries of the employees being put towards costofliving expenses the real winners as far as I can see are the people who own the nearby commercial amp residential property since the values are definitely going up as a result the developers brokering this deal and the corporations that get yet another sliver of the longsincedespoiled formerly virgin market that is Burlington.EDIT furthermore Im VERY sure that whatever executive or managerial positions are created with this expansion will not be sourced locally. ,burlington,cvsud81,7,t5_2ri40

I am not condoning the actions of the victim  who acted foolishly as he was probably high as fuck  but I will also not condone the actions of the officer in this case.  The bottom line is the dude was unarmed.  Yes his concealing his hand behind his back made it appear as though he had a weapon but where was this weapon when the officer was chasing him? Tucked in his gym shorts? I think not.  The gun he was alleged to have was found in a dumpster days before this incident took place.,burlington,d8hiheg,0,t5_2ri40

10226422,0,t1_dc02g3w,This is completely false. I am talking about single family home here. You dont need the fire marshal to inspect your home. Burlington does not have these regulations because people want togtcheap out and not spend the money to have things done right.Where did you make that up from? BTV conforms to national codes like many other cities. But we also have many regulations that have nothing to do with code or safety issues. If you decide to put a new basement egress window in your  year old house you can make it conform to all safety codes and still not meet BTV requirements. The city will tell you the window needs to be made out of wood whether you want wood or not  inside and out. You can argue that its silly to put a wood window below grade. The city will insist you do. You can argue that your home has no wooden windows at all now due to previous changes. The city will still insist. So what is the penalty for you if you did not want to do this? This revokes your certificate of occupancy and stops you from being able to sell your house. ,burlington,dc380bk,1,t5_2ri40
