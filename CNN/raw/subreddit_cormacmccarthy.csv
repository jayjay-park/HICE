9391625,0,t1_d96ge59,CM For what the end of the world? Laughing No they dont have the date.JH Your writing its a form of poetry. But so much of what you read and study is technical and based in fact. Is there a line between art and science and where does it start to blur?CM Theres certainly an aesthetic to mathematics and science. It was one of the ways Paul Dirac got in trouble. He was one of the great physicists of the th century. But he really believed as other physicists did that given the choice between something which was logical and something which was beautiful they would opt for the aesthetic as being more likely to be true. When Richard Feynman put together his updated version of quantum electrodynamics Dirac didnt think it was true because it was ugly. It was messy. It didnt have the clarity the elegance that he associated with great mathematical or physical theory. But he was wrong. Theres no one formula for it.WSJ Is there a difference in the way humanity is portrayed in The Road as compared to Blood Meridian?CM Theres not a lot of good guys in Blood Meridian whereas good guys is what The Road is about. Thats the subject at hand.JH I remember you said to me that Blood Meridian is about human evil whereas The Road is about human goodness. It wasnt until I had my own son that I realized a personality was just innate in a person. You can see it forming. In The Road the boy has been born into a world where morals and ethics are out the window almost like a science experiment. But he is the most moral character. Do you think people start as innately good?CM I dont think goodness is something that you learn. If youre left adrift in the world to learn goodness from it you would be in trouble. But people tell me from time to time that my son John is just a wonderful kid. I tell people that he is so morally superior to me that I feel foolish correcting him about things but Ive got to do somethingIm his father. Theres not much you can do to try to make a child into something that hes not. But whatever he is you can sure destroy it. Just be mean and cruel and you can destroy the best person.WSJ What do you and your son do together? Where do you find common ground?CM My feeling is that consanguinity doesnt really mean much. I have a large family and there is only one of them I feel close too and that is my younger brother Dennis. Hes my kind of guy. Im his kind of guy. And Johns my kind of guy.WSJ Youre both fathers of young children. From watching them do you get the sense that artistic skills are passed down from parents to children?CM John draws all the time but I have to say hes not very good and I was very good. I was a child artist. A wunderkind. I did all kinds of stuff. Big showy paintings of animals. I havent done it in years. All that stuff vanished. I never followed it up.JH We share that. I had severe dyslexia and drawing was my survival mechanism. I ended up having a separate career at a young age where I had stuff in the Art Gallery of Hamilton in Canada when I was very young. I was doing murals for the city.WSJ Really? Im the odd man out who wasnt showing my artwork as a boy?CM I had shows when I was eight years old. It was just for prestige. Local art shows. I can remember some of the paintings. One of them was of a rhinoceros charging. It was kind of nice. A big watercolor mixed media thing. Another one was really bright red a volcano exploding. It was fun. Later on I drew birds and things like that. Nature paintings.WSJ Do you feel like youre trying to address the same big questions in all your work but just in different ways?CM Creative work is often driven by pain. It may be that if you dont have something in the back of your head driving you nuts you may not do anything. Its not a good arrangement. If I were God I wouldnt have done it that way. Things Ive written about are no longer of any interest to me but they were certainly of interest before I wrote about them. So theres something about writing about it that flattens them. Youve used them up. I tell people Ive never read one of my books and thats true. They think Im pulling their leg.WSJ Earlier you referred to the role luck plays in life. Where has luck intervened for you?CM There was never a person born since Adam whos been luckier than me. Nothing has happened to me that hasnt been perfect. And Im not being facetious. Theres never been a time when I was penniless and down when something wouldnt arrive. Over and over and over again. Enough to make you superstitious.,cormacmccarthy,d96geb3,4,t5_2tqna

9823432,0,t3_5fw1u8,Im about halfway through The Orchard Keeper and Im not quite as blown away by the prose as I have been by his other novels. However it was one of his early novels  and much worse novels than this one have made it into the American literary canon Im looking at you Dreiser.,cormacmccarthy,dao0hu1,7,t5_2tqna
