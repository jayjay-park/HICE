8622868,0,t3_4xwwrq,I wrote this on the collaboration post as wellunaeoa  suggested we use a wiki to have a massive hub of info on what has happened to everyones campaigns it would allow for users to research which campaigns are compatible or even just get inspiration for their own.I think that over time the wiki would get massive and there would be hundreds if not thousands of pages of info about the great adventures all the parties have gone through.uJupitera and uAsuperbname also recommended the wiki so it seems to be a somewhat popular idea.I and probably unaeoa  but hell have to confirm would be glad to create and moderate the wiki he suggested using Wikia which I think is a good idea. Once we get to the go from uVaryon Ill go ahead and make the wiki or if someone else wants to make it Ill happily start modding ,RoleIt,d6jgklc,2,t5_3fw0u

Because if we have multiple groups trying to accomplish the same goal a lot of players are going to feel time constrained and thus B line for the ending and not enjoy the world we have built for them. Likewise they will railroad themselves into staying on course and from I have read the biggest advantages of DnD is deviating away from the quest and doing what you and the party wants to do. I think we absolutely need to allow players to change the world individually though like with your village being ransacked by an evil group that is much more attainable. Just make sure it a partys tale gets updated after every adventure and the writers can alter the world as they seem fit and relay that information back to the DMs who then take charge and change what they need to for their group to accomplish what they want too. ,RoleIt,d6k06yo,6,t5_3fw0u
8632995,0,t1_d6kpxza,For me the simple fact that a nondedicated DM cant decide what the core story for their group would be is also a limitation. Also this might just be me personally but an MMODnD has a potential to ruin a players power fantasy. I like to have the feeling that me and my insignificant party members are all that stand between the world and total annihilation. This is diminished somewhat when there are many main characters. Its also a problem when your group is lowerleveled due to starting later than the first groups and not being able to do anything while the high level groups destroy big baddies thats threatening a city.There are just things to take into consideration. Hopefully someone smarter than me can provide solutions. p,RoleIt,d6kqcbj,2,t5_3fw0u
