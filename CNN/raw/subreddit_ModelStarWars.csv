6056375,0,t1_cydgx3h,Ah so there will be a Senate with an elected Chancellor. I like it we should change the factions to different home worlds to expand on things instead of it being Jedi vs Sith because that was never really a inside government thing. Hell Jedi werent even allowed in the government only in their own Jedi Council thats it. Id like to be the inaugural Chancellor if so.,ModelStarWars,cydhlit,1,t5_3bjkx
