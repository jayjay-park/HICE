Dont worry though while youre being kept in the dark now a lot will be explained later in the story. Namely when the trolls start showing up. greyskinned aliens. ,furrylobby,coef737,1,t5_3605q

Then move around the object both looking at and touching its various planes and surfaces getting a sense for how it looksfeels from all angles.  Draw again from the same angle.  Then move onto other angles.  This will help your brain better comprehend the volume of objects.  Will help your drawing overall not just with that one object.,furrylobby,cr1r34q,2,t5_3605q
