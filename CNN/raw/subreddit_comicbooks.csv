14400,0,t1_ceec3i4,The problem with Neonomicon is Avatar. Writers dont sell a book to Avatar unless they are looking for a pay check. Same with Hickmans God is Dead. Avatar isnt Image and they dont share right the same. So if a writer like Moore or Hickman is doing a book at Avatar its because they dont feel the need to own it but want the bigger upfront payout. Im not saying that changes anything about the origin of Neonomicon but its instantly a lesser work in first judgment for being an Avatar book. As far as the sex content goes I tend to think of the ABC books as being the closest to true Moore in that they were originally Image books with the freedom to do what they wanted but he didnt go nearly as far as he has recently. Im kind of wondering if the current work doesnt have any lingering resentment to when DC fucked over that one unpublished Cobweb story that DC meddled with and set Moore off again. Your last assessment of Avatar is spot on and I dont necessarily think it conflicts with the monetary angle. Dynamite will print almost anything but they still have content restrictionslimitations. So if a named writer needed cash they could easily sell a half assed TampA script to Avatar. If it was a solid script Image would snatch it up. Saga isnt rapey but the sexual content is definitely pushes boundaries.,comicbooks,ceg2nz8,2,t5_2qhon

17292,0,t1_cegdmpw,I totally agree that ABC is alien to the average comic reader. But I struggle with accepting average comic readers in general. My experience with comics stems from Metal Hurlants legacy TMNT Eclipse Comico and all those wonderful back and white indies of the s and early s. I wont say that Im anti big two maybe anti N. I certainly have bought my share of Legion of Superheroes and Teen Titans in my day. But I struggle with publishers that exclusively produce books for that demographic. As far as what sells I look at things like the fast food industry. If sales was an indication of quality then McDonalds would be considered the best food in the world. More relating to your point is that what sell is more important for the big two who have minimum profit margins to meet. Which is why I really appreciate the Image system. Its threshold for successes is a lot more sustainable and robust. The joke is that had Walking Dead been a Marvel book it would have been canceled after fifth issue. So ultimately Im indifferent to what actually sells as long at it doesnt entirely derails everything else like back in the extreme and dark and gritty entirely ruled the day.As far as I know Frank Cho is still under contract with Marvel art wise but for the love of god it cant be much longer. But as far as anymore of the ABC characters coming back to life really depends on deep DC Entrainment has their fingers in the current incarnation of Vertigo. I typically dont have a lot of good things to say about Dian Nelson  but that entirely restructuring of DC comics in DC Entrainment really crushed any hopes and dreams I had for ABC or any sidelined properties DC might have. I kind of want to say I dont find them as charming because I think what I originally found charming was the one and done nature of most of the Tom Strong books. Even the bigger story arcs were structured that each individual installments read really well as a stand alone story at least compared to most comics. The playfulness that all the ABC books had with their format really delighted me which is probably why I gravitated to Tom Strong and League more so then Top  even though Top  is arguably the best book of the line.Im remember Moore talking about the Neonomicon sequel and I might have to concede my argument on it. There is still something off about it but Ill hold my judgment until we know what the grand plan for it is. Im still going to try and go back and read all those relevant stories. If there is a chance of a pay off in the future Im willing fallow Moore down that rabbit hole. ,comicbooks,cegehml,1,t5_2qhon

99438,0,t1_cepnhst,You missed on everything since Brand New Day because you disagreed with the direction a story about fictional characters went? You denied yourself of all the enjoyable stories that spun out of it?I have been a fan of SpiderMan for some  years almost and I never understood this sort of mentality. I remember the months and months of the clone saga. The retirement of SpiderMan and his replacement by Mattie Franklin. His deathrebirth during the whole the Other story. His unmasking and everything that stemmed from that. Hell even the whole Miles Morales thing. So many events and so many fans going on about how they stopped reading because x happened.My point is in fifty years in the last  years even there has never been a shortage of storylines that have shaken things up for a while and rubbed fans the wrong way. This is a fundamental part of the character and his stories.SpiderMan and thus the life of Peter Parker is a perpetual soap opera dressed up in colorful costumes and bad jokes. If he isnt making some big mistake and struggling to do the right thing to correct the path his life is currently on then its simply not Peter Parker. Peter Parker is a nice guy a caring man with good intentions but he is a cockup for all the good that he doesthat always present Parker Luck.And on top of all this the character is inherently selfish. Peters major motivation is rooted in guilt this sense that he can never right a wrong somewhere in his past. And his superhero life has constantly come at a great cost to those around him due to his need to hide such things from friends and family. He doesnt simply keep them at arms length so as to minimize the likelihood that theyll be collateral damage or actually targeted this is one thing that the Batman character does right. He actually keeps them in danger unknowingly so because of his actions. Yes he does this all with the best intentions but it constantly backfires and proves to be a fatal flaw quite literally at times in his behavior.In the case of OMD it was the culmination of several major storylines rooted in Peters decisions that blew up in his face for lack of foresightor utter disregard for itbecause he thought that at the time he was doing the right thing. Sure it probably could have been handled a little bit better but ultimately it still played true to the character.For a character who put his thenwife friends family and colleagues in constant danger by hanging around them even after amassing an army of enemies that either knowknew his identity or that Peter Parker is his most wellknown contact. He lies to them. He lies to himself. Hes quit a ridiculous number of timesat one point simply walking away because his clone gave him the chance to do so. So is it really a stretch to think that hed trade his marriage to save a woman he blatantly put in harms way and not just this specific time?In the end it was just one more story in a constant stream of stories and its a shame that you cut yourself off from all the good thats come about since then because you couldnt get past one you didnt like.,comicbooks,cepr23z,40,t5_2qhon

After those youve got Avengers that is still slightly ahead of Deadpool. Hawkeye is actually the one that started the earliesta few months before Marvel Now and is still running now that Avengers Assemble has also been confirmed to end. I dont doubt that Hawkeye will come to an end as well since Fraction seems to be moving away from Marvel books to his own titles and he has talked about bringing the current storyarc to a conclusion.

You can read Harbinger alone and just get their point of view or read Bloodshot also to get his point of view and the mini series itself kind of combines the two somewhat.You could get away with just reading Harbinger all the way through but Id suggest at least also reading the Harbinger Wars  as well. The Bloodshot issues are okay but not as good as the rest of the series. Read it as well if you want the COMPLETE story of Harbinger Wars Although the fight between Bloodshot and Harada was AWESOME! Not sure if that was in the Bloodshot books or also covered in the mini series.Other than that you dont NEED to read any other Valiant books to get whats going on in Harbinger but Id highly recommend you also give XO Manowar and Archer amp Armstrong a try too!

But now Lex is like  years old in this world? Its such a weird choice to cast him as a young Lex. Cranston would make a hell of a lot more sense just based on age. Right now it just looks like the character from the Social Network took all his money and decided to become a villain.

Hes desperately trying to show Batman that sometimes things dont make sense but Batman keeps building a box around the madness to try and contain it with some sort of order.EDIT To expand on this a bit I think that this is the crux of Morrisons understanding of Batman. The death of Bruces parents was something beyond his control. It was a random act of violence and it took everything away from him. So hes spent his entire life making sure that he wont be surprised by anything random or unexpected.

295836,0,t3_1xhkfq,Its..... a bit complicated but Ill try to explain as best as I can.gt Are these all independent series complete with their own origindeath stories villains and have stories that come to their own conclusions then they start again from the beginning?Both Marvel and DC have their own main universe that things take place in but there are also things set outside of that universe. The Ultimate Marvel Universe is the biggest outside of mainstream continuity. So while the clone saga is part of Amazing SpiderMan as a whole and takes place in the main Marvel universe Ultimate Comics SpiderMan takes place in a different universe with its own origin and its own separate events. To even further complicate things all of these universes exist sidebyside as a multiverse which Godlike creatures called Watchers watch over. Theyre each called Earth followed by a number. For example the main Marvel universe is called Earth while the ultimate universe is called Earth. They do cross over into each other as well.And thats just Marvel. DC is even more confusing because they keep rebooting things and their main universe keeps changing.Confused yet?gt If so do they then publish the whole thing in one big book somewhere when its done?Sometimes you can get an entire run of something called an omnibus. These  can be very pricey.gt If not is there more than one unrelated world and storyline of the same character simultaneously existing?Absolutely yes. The different worlds that I was talking about above each have their own versions of the superheroes.gt Does each variationvolumewhatever have its own writers illustrators aesthetic?Of course!

310664,0,t1_cfcvzct, Worst comic Ive ever read....hmmm. Ugh man. Usually when I read something awful I dont even finish it. I just put it down and forget I ever saw the damned thing. Honestly I cant think of one because of how fast I lose interest. I love The Sandman! Who doesnt love the Sandman such a great comic. It was also the first series I ever read when I was a wee teen and it really opened up my eyes to what comics are capable of.  I have two actually! Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb who did several runs on Batman and reinventions of iconic Marvel heroes dubbed the Color series. Also Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon most notably Preacher and Punisher. Ooh Preacher! Another favorite series! And Hellboy! YES! For me a good first issue I like to be surprised! I like shit to crash down weird. Like lets say Wolvie gets back from a trip and suddenly everyone is a zombie! Whats up with that?! Thats messed up I must know more. First issues are hard they really need to end on a some kind of conflict while managing to have established a character I care about be it someone classic or a brand new creation. A great example of that was the comic Black Science. It started off crazy with these explorers trapped on a godforsaken rock with these violent alien creatures. Already Im concerned about these guys and you only watch things fall apart from there. Im emotionally involved especially as the main character monologues what has happened up that point and when the climax hits twenty two pages later I want to know whats going to happen. As a reader I like to learn things as the protagonist learns things really be a part of their adventure.Edit Right! Advice. Damn got caught up talking about comics.My advice is keep pushing and keep going. I know so obvious and dumb but if there is something you want go for it until they tell you stop. I lucked out with Fango but it took my six emails to get the EditorinChief to look my way. Call companies if you have too smile big laugh stupid but dont let them forget you. Oh and write well.

336005,0,t1_cffk5yo,Well...there may be a couple factors. Maybe the biggest is that I never read any Avengers before. If you were keeping up with the Bendis run I imagine you got burnt out. Also I love when Hickman weaves his longform tales. Fantastic Four by him was the only Fantastic Four I had read and it blew me away. It was imaginative plotwise the scope was huge the characters were well written and defined and all the artists were good. Hickmans Avengers run is going exactly like that except its even bigger. Infinity was just the climax of the first part. It was better than Forever Evil Avengers vs. XMen Trinity War or any other event of recent years. Those other things shouldnt even share the title event with Infinity because Infinity is so much better its not even funny.,comicbooks,cffli73,1,t5_2qhon

387034,0,t1_cfkdoio,I disagree. First of all I think Groot should have a deep voice. Secondly you should watch this clip from Chowder. Its John DiMaggio playing a character named Schnitzel and all Schnitzel can say is Radda. Now...before watching it lets ask the same question about it. Why hire John DiMaggio who voiced Bender from Futurama will go on to voice Jake from Adventure Time and a whole lot of other cartoon voices to voice Schnitzel when anyone can say Radda radda radda?The reason is very simple characters who convey all their speech in one word or a series of words still have to emote. True you dont need the best actor which Vin Diesel isnt but hes a serviceable action star but that doesnt mean you should just hire any random person to say I am Groot!TLDR You can have emotion behind a simple I am Groot which is why an actual actor is needed.,comicbooks,cfkvrar,4,t5_2qhon

389705,0,t3_1yivo1,Im a fan of certain aspects of both universes so Ill try to explain what appeals to me and what does not appeal to me from both sides.DC PROSDCs characters seem larger than life. The Green Lanterns are an intergalactic peacekeeping force that can create any objects they can imagine using magic rings. Superman is an alien from a destroyed planet whos biology allows him to absorb the Suns power and turn it into flight laser vision superstrength and nearinvulnerability. Wonder Woman is an Amazon princess from an island inhabited entirely by women and is the daughter of THE Athena. Even Batman is beyond human in many ways obviously he has beyond peak intelligence and physical prowess but hes also fuelled by his inhuman obsession with justice and vengeance.These characters arent just characters theyre part of a Pantheon. When written properly you understand that many of these characters carry the burden of the universe on their shoulders and many of them seem to represent ideals and concepts more than their own individual character. DCs characters and their stories especially their origins have classical mythological qualities to them which not only makes them more familiar but also more likeable. Superman is the exile tasked with guarding his adopted home. Batman is the orphan sworn to execute justice to avenge his parents and prevent the same kind of tragedy that befell him. Green Lantern is a normal guy given extraordinary powers that he must use to protect the universe. These are all stories that can be traced back hundreds if not thousands of years which ends up giving the DC characters a sort of timeless quality.Also even if youre not a DC fan you probably like at least one Batman story because seriously its fucking Batman.MARVEL PROSMarvels characters fall on the opposite side of the spectrum. If DCs characters are a Pantheon then Marvels characters would be the tragic characters of the Greek epics. They would be Ulysses Achilles Jason the human characters who must defy confront and accept their humanity.They have the same problems as many of us  anxiety alcoholism balancing work school and romance controlling our anger feeling misunderstood by society. They approach their problems more casually and many of them feel like someone we know or someone we could be. The reason so many of us love SpiderMan so much is because hes a nerd and a dork and was picked on in high school and we can relate to that. Even when he puts the mask on hes still kind of a goofball the line between Peter Parker and SpiderMan is much thinner than the line between Clark Kent and Superman.The line between the superhero identity and secret identity tends to be very fine in modern Marvel comics which makes it easier to feel like we could be SpiderMan or Hulk. Iron Mans alcoholism affects him in and out of the suit and hes open about the fact that hes just a guy in a suit of armour. Captain Americas boyscout attitude doesnt change at all when hes Steve Rogers hes a Norman Rockwell painting . Thor is actually a Norse god. Wolverine doesnt hesitate to pop his claws ever because thats just who he is. We can identify with SpiderMan because we identify with Peter Parker and SpiderMan IS Peter Parker.Also Im on the Fractrain and Hawkeye is just great right now.DC CONSHoo boy probably going to catch some flak for this so Ill just say right away that this is just my own personal opinion and that I still love DC. But there are problems with the universe and the characters and Im going to talk about them.First off theres a lot of DC to go around. Superman was introduced in  and has NEVER been out of print since. Batman was introduced in  and has ALSO had at least one monthly issue released ever since. Add in Flash GL all of them Wonder Woman Hawkman Aquaman Green Arrow Black Canary The Teen Titans Deadman Swamp Thing Martian Manhunter Red Tornado Zatanna Elongated Man Booster Gold Blue Beetle so and so forth not to mention their supporting cast and their rogues gallery and you have an absurd amount of characters to familiarize with. Marvel has many characters as well but DC has sooo much history behind it. The multiple revisionist and retcon events Flashpoint Crisis on Infinite Earths Infinite Crisis and several alternate earths that frequently intersect with the main earth Prime Earth and it gets difficult to sift through the backlog and figure out what the hell is going on.Alright so thats just issues with publication that can get confusing. Now the characters...As I mentioned before DCs characters are godlike. This can make it hard to connect for some people. Sure you can explain to them that Superman is an alien who loves earth and humans more than anything and despite his nearly infinite power longs to be a human but some people are just going to see Superman flying around the earth to turn back time and think Nah I dont get that guy. I dont have this issue but at the same time Ive never really connected as quickly or as intensely with DCs characters as I have with Marvels.Of course there are amazing stories like The Killing Joke and Kingdom Come that show how deep and intriguing these characters can be but Ive always found that in the average monthly floppies DC never packed the same gut punch as stories like Demon in a Bottle or Death of SpiderMan. Not to say that they cant just that they dont as frequently in my humble opinion which you are more than welcome to disagree with.MARVEL CONSOkay now this is going to be hard for me because Im definitely a Marvel guy at heart.Marvels characters as I mentioned earlier are a little more human with their issues and personalities. This is usually a really good thing especially in the hands of a talented writer. However sometimes Marvels more human approach leads to painful arcs and events and attempted grittiness can very quickly turn into melodrama. Civil War is probably the best example of this. It started out as a fantastic premise after a mutant kills hundreds of people and destroys part of a small town the US government puts the Superhuman Registration Act into place. If you have superpowers sign up otherwise youre a fugitive. Great premise and it was actually executed pretty well for a while. It fell apart very quickly when somebody at Marvel decided to kill Captain America as some sort of ... statement? I guess? It was supposed to be this big grandiose statement about the death of free America or something and it just ended up being painful watching Captain America bleed out knowing he would be back in a year or so.This is probably Marvels biggest issue. Not to say DC hasnt had terrible issues arcs and stories but Marvels tend to be notoriously bad. Clone Saga Ultimatum Secret Invasion One More Day Civil War Sins Past. Sins. Fucking. Past. When Marvel fucks up they fuck up HARD. DCs constant retconning and reboots can be confusing and annoying but Marvels calamitous events are just downright painful to read both as a fan of the characters and a fan of good writing.While it doesnt necessarily affect the mythos of the characters from the perspective of someone whos only ever seen the SpiderMan movies its absolutely devastating to someone whos read every single SpiderMan comic. Sins Past was like having a really great girlfriend who has her ups and downs but is overall pretty great and then one day she just fucks your best friends dad.So yeah I guess thats the best and worst of DC and Marvel from my perspective. Hope that kind of answers your question without being too longwinded.TLDR DC and Marvel both have great qualities about them but also tend to shit the bed pretty frequently as well. Ultimately its a matter of which characters and stories you enjoy and identify with more.,comicbooks,cfl5q4q,96,t5_2qhon

432264,0,t1_cfpk659,Ive read most of Elliss work although I can admit that I have a bit of a blind spot for his mainstream superhero stuff. The closest thing to it that Ive read was his Nextwave Agents of H.A.T.E. and The Authority. If youre into his superhero stuff thats cool. You seem to have wellthought out reasons for doing so. As for his attempts to be edgy Im not talking about dark tones. I have no problem with dark tones. I prefer dark tones. Im a huge fan of Moore Ennis when hes not writing stuff thats as juvenile as I think Ellis is and several other writers who dont write light fluffy stuff so thats not really what Im referring to. Ellis has a lot of iconoclastic themes in his writing. His characters are usually the type which have a major problem with authority so much so that they react violently to authority or towards people who disagree with them the way a teenager might. Instead of saying something substantive with a work like Transmetropolitan he deals in a lot of vagueries always having Spider Jerusalem ugh his names are the worst rant sanctimoniously about THE TRUTH whatever that is  while also having him perform violent and despicable acts on other people. He even lampoons this tendency in the series itself.

482673,0,t1_cfv43sw,Haha DC is pretty bad at hiding their dirt. I mean Marvel has their own. Brubakers odd way of leaving. Fractions Inhumanity gag and then the way that hes clearly slowly walking away. I have a friend who works for a company thats a child company of Disney and he was telling me they sign some pretty crazy gag orders. DC having not gone this route at this point shows a pretty clear lack of understanding of both their staff and the nature of the industry. Then again you also have Greg Rucka flare outs that lead to him coming back cause creator owned didnt work out. Maybe they dont want to make Marvel mad since they have most of the jobs? I wouldnt completely give up on DC. I think theyre slowly weeding out and figuring out how to adapt to Johns seeming lack of a plan. It would help if the fans would buy new things but the DC crowd seems a lot more traditional despite not understanding what the traditions actually are at times.

The Ultimate Doomsday trilogy Miles Morales HickmansRibics Ultimates.  All fantastic.  But so many people never gave them a chance because Ultimatum was too much for them.  It just doesnt seem worth it for the amount of tarnishing it did.  Especially when they could read a wikipedia plot summary to get up to speed.

A thousand times All New XMen. No Im not bothered by the O being different than we expect them to be. Theyre in a world radically different from their own. Its the terrible characters SURROUNDING them.  Kitty Pryde? Please step back into the giant bullet and leave. You wereare willing to risk the fate of the universe to allow them to stay. You then blow up on everyone for not following your terrible lead. Youre also a goddamned Mary Sue. You can teach a telepath how to control their powers? WHAT THE FUCK!?  Jean Grey? Once again Im not upset that shes different or more powerful than she should be at her age. Im upset because youre a terrible person who makes Emma Frosts ethics look downright angelic. X? What has Bendis done to you? Call me nuts but I think theyre coming back? What is that!? Then youre barely even wallpaper during Trial.Theres also the pointlessness of the title. That bothers me more than anything. Trial of Jean Grey was a huge improvement and Im giving the next arc another chance but without Young Cyclops I dont have much hope.,comicbooks,cgeerdl,0,t5_2qhon

The amount of care that went into each issue each panel is still as breathtaking to me as it was the first time I saw it.  He has no peers when it comes to superhero artists who can match the same kind of actionpacked hyperdetailed yet fluid intensity hes known for.  Im waiting with bated breath that Perez and Busiek! will some day return to the team he helped dig out of the gutters of the s to turn it into the premiere group they are today.  Even if it were just another miniseries Marvel would be printing money if they were able to have Perez back on the Avengers.  Hes the definitive artist for the team even topping Kirby in my books and getting his run from Volume  is worth it for the art alone.,comicbooks,cgf6obu,2,t5_2qhon

689855,0,t3_221eim,I feel similarly.  In my eyes where this book really succeeded was just the use of the medium.  Some folks thought the book flipping got annoying but I thought those ideas were used to great effect as well as paneling ideas coloring etc.  In that sense it was a very creatively told story and that was my favorite thing about it.As far as the story itself it started with a bang and ended with a whimper.  The characters were pretty onedimensional and not very welldeveloped and the love story thing was also underdeveloped so when Lemire tried to play that up at the end it really fell flat.  Same goes for Clay  pretty onedimensional and underdeveloped so when there is a moment of character development it was forcedrandom and didnt really land.  I also thought the ending was sort of tritely melodramatic in that every little thing that could possibly go wrong did.,comicbooks,cgioshs,3,t5_2qhon

702225,0,t1_cgk1plh,Alfred did his best to raise what remained but in the end look at how involved he is in Batmans operations. He simply had to accept that young Master Wayne was no more so he guided young Bruce in to becoming the Batman without destroying himself in the process. Im not saying that the Batman is devoid of all emotions and humanity simply that hes consumed in his psychosis. He sees everything through the lens of Batman. He took in Dick a young boy whos life paralleled his own and ultimately turned him in to as close to a mirror image of Batman. Jason was a troubled boy who Batman was never really able to reach quite like he did Dick. There was always a disconnect between the two. Ill be honest Im not too familiar with Tims history or even what his motivations are for becoming a vigilante. I just know that he figured out the identities of Batman and Robin through his own deductive reasoning which impressed Batman. Batman has definitely evolved over the years to show more human emotino but I still say that Bruce is the front. His dynamic with all those that are close to him are in the context of being Batman. He lives eats and breathes Batman. Bruce Wayne is simply the facilitator read financier for his operations.,comicbooks,cgk3g7p,1,t5_2qhon

And also youre wrong more female writers and artists is swell but having a major motion picture is better. Comics are a tiny little corner of the entertainment world and dont have any effect of the overall world. A massively funded DCMarvel film with a female superhero that will affect tons of little girls all over the world spur on TV shows copy cat films toys games etc...It can have a snowball effect that will be positive for little girls.

Its white people trying to survive looking for food and black people looting for food after Katrina. Why is it we have mainly white superheros? If racesex didnt matter why wouldnt there be more? Having diverse superheroes would help show it doesnt matter what race you are it matters that you can fly and shoot lasers out of your eyes. If we live in an ideal world having a Latino superhero wont be to appeal to latinos itll be because the author wanted the hero to derive his superpowers from ancient Mayans or the black south african who played a role against an evil apartheid the same way Captain America fought for us in WWII or he chose a woman for the same reason someone else chose a man. With different sexes you can tell a different story. The characters racesex will just add elements to the story not be the story.

Also I live abroad so shipping is a real bear.So I pirate my comics to read myself but at the same time Im buying the top  and having them sent to a public library in the USA.  It seems far better for the industry as a whole and for the creators than simply buying and keeping them for myself would be.  This way lots of people get exposed to comics  and good ones!Compare that with the squeaky clean version of buying digitally from Comixology which I still do for digitalonly titles I want to support.

Dan Slott may have had more stories for him but sooner or later this was always going to happen and it lasted a pretty solid  issues so it isnt like he had a  issue story cut down to .  Same thing for when Cap was replaced by Bucky for a few years after Civil War Brubaker always intended it to be a story that would end with Steve Rogers coming back though in that case it was editorial that actually stretched it out and Brubaker and Quesada were always clear he wouldnt stay dead forever.gtEd Brubakers Winter Soldier is the only instance of resurrection that I believe increased the quality of the story.I would say Green Lantern Rebirth bringing back Hal Jordan and the subsequent  years of Green Lantern stories benefited from a major resurrection.  Many would argue bringing back Barry Allen did so as well though personally I was pretty happy with Wally West.  While much of what was done with Jason Todd was forgettable I really enjoyed the initial Under the Red Hood story.  While much of Kevin Smiths work over the years has varried from forgettable to downright horrible his run on Green Arrow where he brought Oliver Queen back was awesome and resurrected not just the character but I title that was cancelled.

846133,0,t3_23t2ge,Have you looked around for a different comic shop? Even if you have to settle for a less than stellar store what matters is getting the comics. Construction has turned a  minute drive into an hour drive to my favorite comic shop so Ive started to have to go to the shop closest to my school. Its cramped and smells funny and I dont like their pull list policies but Im getting my comics every week.Switching to digital is a really difficult transition especially if youve been reading physical comics all this time. Its a very different feeling between holding an iPad and holding an actual comic book. You dont get the satisfaction of carrying that stack of books home. Its mighty convenient if you have the right mindset about it but personally I just couldnt commit to it past a subscription to marvel unlimited. ,comicbooks,ch0gjq0,2,t5_2qhon

Everything ties back to Spidey every villain every motivation every character of note. In the MU or MCU it feels big like theres space for characters to develop independently of each other and for reasons of their own. And yes theres pretty much three types of scene in ASM Romance between Peter and Gwen that needs to be better established than in the first film for SPOILER reasons.  Action. Scenes that are more about setting up future movies and spinoffs than they are about telling as good a story as possible in this movie.

He is shown to have this power and shown saying he wants to kill SpiderMan but most of their fight was him chasing Spidey around the power plant. Electro had multiple opportunities to do this. Maybe I am missing something. If so somebody please inform me.The Rhino scene was basically the same thing they showed in the trailer.

940660,0,t1_chb5k8p,gtUh yes it is.  Thats kind of the definition.  If you start writing a comic book to right the wrongs of the past instead of to entertain that is the very definition of forced.No. Obviously you shouldnt have one single thing in mind when you write a Comic book . you can entertain while having diversity in mind. Nothing forced about doing both. For example lets say you are a writer. You created your standard team of  white guys with various powers. because as we both know the White man is the standard and default in our society in most mediums. you realize that your team is not diverse or inclusive at all. nothing is wrong  or forced with trying to make your team more inclusive. You may think well hmm maybe I should think make it more inclusive. And you do it. Maybe you lead white guy with the magic of your pen and mind turns into a woman. Or a different race. Basically you can do both. gtNostalgia dollar  safety.  Established characters are called established for a reason.  They have previously appeared in books so they have fans already and unless you diverge completely from the character its very likely that character will sell again.My point wasnt denying that the established characters are well.... Established. I understand the concept of nostalgia and being safe. My point is that heroes of color for example couldnt have been created as the same time as captain America for example. The racism in America wouldnt allow It. see Lobo the first African American with his own book. Those factor stopped them from being as iconic and as established as say supes or cap. Minority are starting from behind. And now in America we can fix that. Nothing wrong with doing It. We can fix that by having more minority heroes. Less cannon fodder. Better writers better artists flesh out established minority heroes rouges galleries. Etc. I hope my point was clear here. The context matters why black Panther and spider man have different popularity levels. Even though they were created around the same time. gtA new character requires a lot of work.  Concept.  Visual design.  Characterization.  Every single aspect not tried against an audience.  A combination that could go horribly wrong.  Something a writer might not be familiar with or management might not be comfortable with.When these characters were created were the writers any of these things? Was the writer for iron man a billionaire playboy with robots? Was the writer for captain America a war hero? Was the writer for hulk a gamma ray monster? The answer is obviously no. They arent familiar with those things. But they made it work and researched something a good writer does. So you tryna tell me that writing a minority is harder than writing gamma ray monster because a minority is unfamiliar territory? gtYou handle it wrong you get characters like Shamrock or Tyroc from DC or Vibe... at best fans dont like the character which reflects badly upon the book they appear in.  At worst its considered offensive and theres a backlash that leaks into the public arena outside the fandom.For every shamrock Im not including the other two because Tyrocwho is a great leader in Legion lost and vibe who starred in his own solo recently  both are great characters today. But for every shamrock there is a cyborg black Panther etc. Ordinal characters can be great characters with Time. gtVic Stones a good example of diversity leaking into the DCU.  Cyborgs had the last decade to take center stage.  The Teen Titans cartoon.  The pre Teen Titans series.  Flashpoint.  And now hes in the JLA with a great origin reboot that allowed him to take center stage out the gate... being integral in fighting Darkseid.  Whether happenstance or very careful craftsmanship hes been pushed to be very mainstream to add diversity to the JLA that does not seem forced.Lmao you are literally the only person on reddit who doesnt think cyborg wasnt forced. When the new  was announced all I saw was cyborg was forced! You are in the minority. I agree cyborg wasnt forced. So I am too. But cyborg was a glorified school bus before couple months ago. Hes just now getting some shine. Also no solo. Complete bullshit. gtJames Rhodes the War Machine is another prime example.  He appeared in Iron Man as a regular guy.  It took  years of issues before he became Iron Man.  Sadly he kind of gets the shaft as the poor mans Iron Man but hes got a big revival in comics well given the fickleness well see how it lasts with Iron Man  giving him a good stance.Are you referring to his new series? gtIm not saying diversity hires need to wait their turn... given the periodical format of the medium though you do need to make their introduction as a main cast character more natural than cramming it inside the half of a year. This is with any character. Not just a minority. A good writer makes it work. ,comicbooks,chb7iyd,-1,t5_2qhon

949316,0,t1_chc6mzd,Hmmm. I would say I read comics like a TV show or movie in which I constantly control the playback speed.Reading lefttoright words and pictures together Ive noticed that sometimes the pictures are structured such that they only work that way. For example you might have a panel where two people are talking and in the static photo they both seem to be talking at the same exact time but its obviously meant to be sequential.EDIT To me the biggest difference between comics and books is that books require you to use more of your imagination. Comics take more imagination than video and books more than that. I feel like comics hold my hand just enough but still get my imagination really active.Also Im starting to notice comic artists using page structure and paneling to greater effect which I really love. ,comicbooks,chc70yz,2,t5_2qhon

Id aim for it to be a PG affair so characters die but mostly offscreen and never in a gory way. Id start with the original five Jason Zack Trini Billy and Kimberley with minor modifications to make the characters deeper eg Billy being gay in a little tribute to David Yost and Id make Rita Repulsa the first villain with characters like Goldar appearing and being defeated but not killed because good guys dont kill. Id also make the rangers powers a little more obvious and give each of them an extra power that can be used in and out of the costumes Jason has super strength Kim can fly for short periods of time like a controlled glide and I would introduce Tommy until the second arc where hed be the evil Dragon Ranger a little tribute story to Green With Evil.

Then in other issues he gets punched and actually hurt by Cyclops and Cable and Stryfe. Stryfe should not be able to match Apocalypse physically.

There was a point where i wasnt reading comics for a few years and when I came back in for the first time she remembered my full name and where I worked! She really makes you feel at home there. One of the only downsides is she doesnt get many copies of alternative or small press comics like the other store in town does. She also discounts back issues older than six months to like a buck each. But I like to spread the love around so I get all my Big  books from Ms. Theresa.The other shop is called ...and Books Too They sell a lot more than comics and are the bigger of the two stores in the city.

But there was so much more to it than that.We see Alan I wrote the book on willpower Scott stepping back up to the plate not letting a little thing like death stop him. Jay Garrick fearless in the face of danger just like with Wotan. Hawkgirl once again telling Alan that he cant do this alone and getting through after onewomanarmying her way through a nest of Parademons to rescue Flash. These are the Wonders Ive wanted to see since the first arc and it feels like its back on track. Jimmy Olsen telling Thomas Wayne to stop being a whiner and step the fuck up like everyone else is might be exactly what he needs to live up to his sons example. And I actually enjoyed Vals portion. Heres a guy whos thrown into the worst situation imaginable and hes making the best of it that he can. The last page where he pulls aside his outer shirt to reveal the Superman tee beneath was great. Its the iconic pose but his expression is what seals it. I see it as someone who idolized Superman and what he represented being faced with an unthinkable situation. For the first time since his introduction I sympathize with and care for the character.,comicbooks,chzh2fw,7,t5_2qhon

I also agree that it was ridiculous how shittily they were trying to announce problems and proper links to go to for the sale. I mean to only use twitter and not edit the website was ridiculous.Also telling people that oh refresh your cart til you see  day passes appear some people might not have checked out yet was asinine considering theres a timer and you could easily be squandering your chance for any tickets by doing that.The shitty other side to this is that its essentially forcing people to cave and buy a relatively high priced single day ticket. Greed is strong with this one. I get the business logic of raising the ticket prices as the years get more and more crowded and the con has become just a relevant as San Diego but god damn those individual day prices are so unjustifiable. Its kinda wild thinking how  years ago  bucks was your  day pass price.  passes per transaction is also just complete bait for scalpers plain and simple.I honestly cant fathom what the hell is going to go down at the comic shops that signed contract to be retailers for the passes. Ive heard stories of people camping around on street corners waiting for NYC shops to open. The worst thing about this is the retailers have no control the type of tickets and amount they get.

And its not like I was a regular customer this was only my nd or rd visit to the shop and the last for about  years.Fast forward  years his store has moved locations and Im looking to find a couple of bettergetthemnow variants driving all over town looking for them which is dumb because of the gas and time costs spent would have been better to get it on ebay.The new store is dimly lit and very cluttered.  Id call it an organized mess.  Only about half of the store is used for comics.  The back half of the shop is partitioned off and I see a drum kit off to the side not where any comic shoppers would venture by and there is a wicker table and  chairs.  I figure they put out a table so someone could have a place to sit and read some books theyve purchased.  Well maybe it looks like the table was more likely intended for a religious gatheringteaching area.  There were LDSrelated materials scattered on the table set about in a display format.  Mind you this was near the center of the shop and there was comicrelated items located nearby wall books and such.  I found it a bit odd and somewhat hypocritical that he was pushing one set of values in one section of the store and another just around the corner in the adultonly section.All this combined with an overall creepy vibe just makes me stay away.  Luckily I have some great stores in town to visit.,comicbooks,cil90ze,6,t5_2qhon

1398337,0,t1_cirera8,Youre mocking something but youre over simplifying as well. The classic notion is that DC has mythic iconic heroes which have also been described as godly. Morrison literally based his classic JLA run on that notion and DC has never shied away from it. Green Lantern may be a regular guy but hes also got a magical ring that manifests anything he can think of. GA is an exception and there are plenty others but their roster doesnt have to completely fit that paradigm for it to be true. Marvel heroes have feet of clay. Thors Marvel origin has him unable through his vanity to rise to his fathers expectations. Herc is a demigod who isnt accepted by nearly anyone in his pantheon has similar daddy issues and isnt the brightest bulb to begin with. theres an argument to be made that the most human of DCs gods are the New Gods  created by the greatest Marvel expatriate Now neither mythic nor human lend themselves to necessarily uninteresting stories.

1482880,0,t1_cj239j5,Well even if you look at Midtown you cant order next months comics because it was past the pre order cut off date and cant do a regular order until it is released. The reason Midtown is able to easily to meet most requirements after date is because they probably order a few hundred of each book and even if they go over then they have people not only all over the US but other countries buying their books. Then they have to be books in certain increments so a shop cant jut buy   or  issues and such and have to order   or . If a shop typically sells  of a title then they dont tend to jump up to the  quantity because then they tend to be stuck with a extra  and dont have the customer base larger stores have to get rid of them. So its very common for the first  months to be shaky on orders because their order forms were already sent out and they have to meet your pull list with what has already been ordered. Now the LCS doesnt want to lose your business because they added your books to their orders for the following month so now if they usually buy  then now they have to buy  to make sure they cover the one book you are buying and with backing out that means they are stuck with  more books than they usually need.,comicbooks,cj25kha,1,t5_2qhon

Shes basically in motorcycle gear that looks LESS armoured than regular gear and in gear as tight as what shes wearing she wouldnt be able to fight or run.

Its weird to describe... When something like this comes up even at work I feel like people are not pointing out that I know about it theyre more expecting you from giving them props that they now know about it too. So even when they say something about Character X and involve you in the process theyre not exactly asking you to confirm  or god forbid  correct them or even prolong that conversation by providing something on the subject. The best comparison I can find is when the soccer world cup runs and suddenly everybody is a fan and an expert. YOU know about soccer but you most likely have to take the crap from everybody else and you cant even argue about what they say without coming off as a douche. Same applies to comics. They talk about it just to show they know whats cool right now but dont really have any interest on the matter. ,comicbooks,cj5dfsl,1,t5_2qhon
1509320,0,t3_2bgkqf,Its all about self marketing and the message XMen is trying to convey. See XMen is about discrimination through birth it used to be an allegory to race homosexuality and other aspect that a person has no control over. Now look at the Fantastic Four. An almost perfect family husband and wife and two more to complete the family Yes I know they arent all related my point still stands. Plus they are rich astronauts scientist superstars. Rich people and astronauts get all the perks. Being rich rarely gives you incentive to do crime which is probably why a lot of Superheroes are millionaires and billionaires. And they advertise themselves as being champions of justice. Some have it harder than other tho like SpiderMan for example. The public perception on him changes from time to time.Basically imagine real world analogues. If Chris Hatfield Bill Nye and The Rock gained superpowers that would be cool! A bunch of well liked and respected public figures can now fight crime and help humanity! Great!Now imagine if random people suddenly got superpowers. Some poor desperate group of people are mutants. Well fuck who are these guys? Are they dangerous? Some random punk got powers. Should we be worried? Mutant power appear in the early teens theres no way they are responsible enough to have superpowers! Theres also this Brotherhood of Mutants that is running around and doing bad things! Every other mutant is bad too right?!Superpowers dont make you a superhero. There are about  times more supervillains than heroes in this world. Now we have to deal with every Jack and Jill getting powers randomly? Imagine if suddenly the government gave a random amount of guns to random teens everywhere. There would be a panic.

This sub has turned me on to countless new books and good stories and every Wednesday the sub is flooded with images from the current weeks comics.  Im sure theres plenty of people subscribed here that just like the comic book movies a lot but after spending significant time in a subreddit thats truly made extensive talk of a comic book character I love impossible I really dont think rcomicbooks has the same kind of problem.

1663398,0,t1_cjothdp,I believe the whole sadclownseesdoctorthing dates back well into the s as a common joke or story most often with the clown being Grimaldi since he was one of the most popular clowns of his time if not the most popular clown and visionary in his area of the arts. Grimaldis autobiography edited by Charles Dickens never explicitly recites this as an actual occurrence or part of one of his routines so its basically kind of a folk story. The Pagliacci opera did not come about until the s.So Moore definitely changed it to Pagliacci as the joke existed well before the s. But the concept of the sad clown is something that goes back a long way into pantomiming at least into the s if not earlier.As I just learned it is thought that Moore used the name Pagliacci in reference to a Will Eisner The Spirit strip Palyachi The Killer Clown from July   meant to reference the Pagliacci opera. Palyachi is how you phonetically pronounce Pagliacci as the g is silent and the cc is like our ch sound. I do not know if that strip of The Spirit references the doctor joke though.,comicbooks,cjou0e5,2,t5_2qhon

Looking back at your comment I think it actually is nice for the spotlight to be on certain characters instead of having them go up against any villains or grownup Cyclops.I agree about the art its pretty awesome. It actually reminds me of Fiona Staples work on Saga. Im fairly new to comics so Im not sure what the issue with Bendis is. Ive been reading a lot of DC and Image and have been trying to get into Marvel and finally settled on some Xtitles. I started off with Bendis Uncanny XMen and then AllNew XMen but Ive grown to enjoy ANXM more for some reason.

1711183,0,t3_2e0dyh,Final may be advanced unless you get the two Superman tie ins which are in the trades.I think  is a given esp the final issue.Infinite Earths is good but possibly not as necessary. It was to merge the dozens of DC worlds into one then certain titles explained how certain world chars jsa ie ended up in dc world.Infinite Crisis made a new planet Earth to reset reality but it wasnt a big deal in the titles bc they went on business as usual. said fifty two identical realities were made in IC but each was altered a lil. These too were ignored outside of a couple books like jsa and zoo crew and lord havoc etc.Flashpoint was a largely unnecessary time change like IC but it was a way to throw Vertigo and Wildstorm and Milestone characters in the DCU. It was a bit silly since those sub company books largely were in DC proper or one of the  earths.

1737689,0,t1_cjy0xxg,Well I hope they address the fact that it was literally Supermans first time trying to end a worldending conflict after an emotional rollercoaster. His head wasnt fully in the game yet as it were since it is only now he was playing it. With the inexperience comes stupid collateral damage and being forced to kill Zod which they should acknowledge should paint Superman in a terrible light.This should be the reason Superman develops his nokill code and Boy Scout reputation because he knows he has to overcome the stigma his initial appearance caused and work twice as hard at inspiring people to be better by becoming a better hero himself. The killing and destruction works if it lays the foundation for why Superman becomes the paragon he supposedly needs to be. If they make it his Uncle Ben moment or dark night of the soul where he learns that with great power comes great responsibility to borrow a Marvel phrase I am totally fine with that. Hell never let himself live it down and it makes him more human in a way.It also potentially gives Lex Luthor and Batman excellent motivations for being antagonistic towards Superman. Godlike aliens do all that damage and the battle culminates with one alien killing another? I wont care for the reasons behind the why so much I would still fear and mistrust Superman because the initial impression wasnt so clean cut and inspiring. Batman could effectively mentor Clark into being a better hero. Lex would take his mistrust to the next level to justify his villainous acts stating that with Superman around humanity is essentially rendered obsolete but hes really just angry Superman is effortless at just being better than him.Well at least that is how I would do it if I incorporated it in the story. Hopefully BvS or MoS  will tackle the killing of Zod and Metropolis destruction.,comicbooks,cjy77bb,6,t5_2qhon

My favorites have always been those with a brighter view of the world or those who are written in a more hopeful light. Supermans boy scout behavior has never bothered me. Its the practically invincible nature of his abilities that has always bothered me. SpiderMan is a character that generally tries to all the right things in a similar vein to Superman but isnt invincible. Nightcrawler is another character thats the same way. Yes he can be written in a darker way at times but hes always been the light in the darkness where the XMen are concerned.Theres a reason my favorite titles have been the more light hearted titles that are out now. Ms Marvel Cyclops Rocket Raccoon Nightcrawler Mighty Avengers Amazing XMen etc. These are always the titles that Im pulling off the stack first.

Is it white knights trying to gain some brownie points? article authors trying to get pageviews by stirring up shit for little reason? And yeah Im sick of hearing this.. attractive men equals a male power fantasy while attractive female characters are completely negative traits for women readers and only serve as eye candy for dudes. Women dont like feeling sexy? they dont day dream of being Wonder Woman? Its comic books.. The reader decides how they feel about the characters. Honestly as far as costumes go.. the only one that REALLY fucking annoys me was the New  Starfire.

1755351,0,t1_ck05x7o,dude you are so wrong. Ha ha I would laugh more but sadly most readers think like you.Most comic book scripts are  pages. Most comic books are  to  pages.  If pictures are worth a thousand words these scripts should be much longer right??Heres a typical script description.Peter is shocked to see Aunt may painting the ceiling of the kitchen.Peters dialogue blah blah blahSFX Paaaint As Aunt May rolls on paintThat could be one of  to  to  panels on a page. Theres no description on the perspective or the view point or how big the panel is. Theres no description on where characters are placed or what they wear.So a lot of the heavy lifting that you see is the artists adaptation of a script. If you gave the same script to another artist you would get something totally different back. This is most notable when theres a fill in artist and you just know the vibe is off and the book isnt as good most recent example I can think of is that two issue fill in on SheHulkEither way comics are mostly a collaborative medium so sometimes there are more directions in the script but usually not. It just drives me crazy to see how  of the execution of a comic is kind of pushed aside like all they do is draw the characters likenesses and stuff like that. ,comicbooks,ck0f4e2,1,t5_2qhon

In fact Gustavs only real responsibility was to look after the science teams mascot a cat named Gluon.  Proving himself inadequate for even this menial task Gustav lost Gluon the morning the collider was to be turned on.  Not wanting the team to think him a complete incompetent Gustav searched high and low for the cat eventually finding Gluon inside the beamline as the experiment went active.  Gustav and Gluon were reduced by the particle accelerator to a comingled quarkgluon plasma and exist in perpetual quantum superposition as man cat mancat and neither man nor cat until observed at which point they become Schrodingers Catman.,comicbooks,ck62tu2,5,t5_2qhon

1811221,0,t1_ck7ezin,Yeah definitely a good book to have acquired and as far as the media influence on worth its all about supply and demand so if comics become cool to be involved in then the audience for interest grows therefore demand grows and therefore your book gains value. It is always good to keep up with what movies are planned in the future cartoons toys and all sorts of media outside of comics to really see where potential changes could come up for certain books and characters! Fantastic  used to be a top notch collectable book series not that it doesnt still hold great value but the movies were done poorly and havnt quite gained the hype that The Avengers Wolverine Iron Man and other such big hits nowadays have done. Wolverine movies have been done terribly as well but he himself has become increasingly popular because even though the nerds out there are pissed they fucked the stories up the general audience doesnt know that so they just want Wolverine gear because hes cool and a badass.

1814681,0,t1_ck7slre,You answered your own question. Vertigo and Image offer different business models. Vertigo pays upfront but takes ownership of the property as a concession. Vertigo also has a budget for marketing. Creators are paid on the back end from Image once theyve taken their cut and doesnt spend on marketing unless youre Robert Kirkman.Vaughan has Hollywood money as does Brubaker and Kirkman. Fraction Ellis Aaron and Hickman have done time at the Big Two to build a name for themselves and a loyal following which makes their creator owned books more viable. Ellis in particular has never been all that interested in working for Marvel. He does brief stints when someone gives him something attractive to work with and a nice paycheck but he was pumping stuff out through Avatar before Eric Stephenson sought him out.People have always bought based on creator. It just seems to have finally taken off to the point where its more financially viable for creators to stick with it rather than go back to Marvel or DC. Kirkman and Vaughans success would also have a hand in it especially since Vaughan was gone for long and came back with a boom.I dont think Marvel is all that worried because they offer what Image cant  exposure. Theyre not selling new stories or creators theyre selling characters that everybody knows and love and people buy it. Theyre always going to have talented people that will want to play with their characters and build a name for themselves.,comicbooks,ck7umti,2,t5_2qhon
1816531,0,t1_ck7yotq,At a certain point it becomes not good storytelling anymore. I think the biggest sign of that is they choose to make a big event out of it counting down until it happens.

Now what actor will they find to play Shazam that will make people root against The Rock? You have to take away his greatest asset. And if you do make him charismatic you end up with a ThorLoki situation where they have to reshoot movies to add more Loki because most people dont care about Thor.

1821934,0,t1_ck8pl7a,Id really like to go the optimism route and say its planned. I really think that Snyder and Nolan sat down and were like Okay. Everyone thinks were going to do a quintessential Superhero flick...Lets NOT do that because theyre the type of directors who want to surprise their audiences. MoS WAS a bit more SciFi and its because they didnt want to fall in the trappings of making a Super Hero film.The thing is with Superman you can get away with it.Thats why Thor  kiiiiinda fell flat. There wasnt a caveat or a hook into it. It was a Superhero flick and you didnt care. It was a big dumb blonde muscle head punching things...also Loki kinda was there being Loki. With Superman you CAN do a beacon of justice kind of punch big things character because the ROOT of his being is just THAT. It isnt an edgy reboot or a crazy pewpew lazer fight Despite being from an alien homeworldGrant Morrison put it best Doomed Planet. Desperate Scientists. Last Hope. Kindly Couple. Superman.Its the simplicity of his character that can draw in people its the innate goodness that can do it. Superman is best portrayed as a CONCEPT not as a person. Look up some of the best Superman novels of all times. The best ones are never Metallo is robbing a bank or UltraHumanite is terrorizing an orphanage or Clark finds a new bagel stand he likes. Its Superman boiled down to the core concepts of Truth and Justice.  But so many people are SO jaded from the constant barrage of things that they cant see that a wholesome character can be cool can be awesome. So to be honest they took a more...logical and some may say safer route. But they didnt detract from future films Other than completely nixing Zod. But to be fair how often do you REALLY wanna see a recurring villain in a big movie. Sure okay Thanos is a major overarching threat but if he got beaten in Avengers Fight Thanos would you really go and watch Avengers Fight Thanos Again Avengers Thanos goes Hawaiian. and Avengers Thanos Steps up  tha streetz?No. No one would.tldr I feel the optimism way would be the way to go.

He screws up he does the wrong thing but hes always trying to be a better person and the kind of leader that the mutant races needs even if that means the mutant race will reject him.Liking a character doesnt mean you have to think everything they do is infallible.

Sometimes the EP will get so snoody theyll pull the bitch its my money so do it my way route and Directors will cave so they can keep a good rep with that EP and potentially use their funding in the future.

In the article it mentions that the little girl loved the JL animated series and cartoons well plenty of women are featured in that show heck most of the time we got stand alone stories or stories heavily featuring the many women characters of the JL. Comic books feature lots of women hell the BEST comic book DC has right now is Wonder Woman imho. Hell didnt they make Thor a woman not too long ago? I mean the Avengers like the JL only has one woman on the team which is a problem yeah but there are so many other titles featuring women why does the fact that theres only one woman on JL a problem when you have titles like Catwoman Wonder Woman Batgirl Batwoman SpiderWoman Worlds Finest Supergirl Black Widow so on? If anything this is a toygame company marketing problem does DC even have anything to do with that angle? People still want to believe that the majority of comic book readers are white males but thats simply not the case. Its a diverse world and with comic books getting even popular a lot of people are into superheroes. If anything the toy company should be featuring an equal amount of male female LGBT characters imo just like it is in the comics. ,comicbooks,ckpe032,-15,t5_2qhon
1960687,0,t1_ckp9wf1,Very interesting post you have here. I hadnt thought about some of these points and I think were looking at the same problem from slightly different angles.What bugged me about this article was that I think its generally bad for society when children are taught early on that girls should like preappropriated girl things and boys should like boy things. It leads to a negative chain of events that can evolve into bigger problems later on in adolescence much of whats wrong with our society right now in my opinion. When a girl decides she has no interest in something because there are no girl characters thats a red flag to me. I think it is an unfortunate choice to decide the right thing to do is to add some girl things to a game to make your daughter interested instead of trying to pique her interest in the other heroes that are there. Its just reinforcing behavior that conforms to a restricting social status quo. Its judgmental and rude to criticize someones parenting I know but there it is. I typed the anecdote from my childhood to try to explain that I think it made me a more open minded person to have shed this mentality early on. I agree we would be great if there were more equal representation for men and women throughout various media outlets but it should be a joint effort. We as the public need to stop being closedminded genderrole fools and the publishers need to understand that having women more prevalent in their products is good for everyone. I dont think we need to just have all the girls thinking Captain America is cool it would also be great if boys didnt have to feel weird for thinking Black Widow is awesome. Because she is. I had to feel weird for liking girl characters for years and thats messed up.

2016578,0,t3_2hukql,gtWith DC I have heard about a lot of criticism from about the new  on this sub as well as from linkara a reviewer on thatguywiththeglasses that also got me interested in comics so I might want to start on something a little further back I would guess. But if there really are any must read new  do let me know.gtIf the Arkham games are any kind of idea Like others have stated the New  is hit or miss. But I HIGHLY recommended Wonder Woman and Batman which have consistently been awesome. If you want a GL book it really depends on who your favorite is as there are a number of titles relating to GL. If I had to recommend one it would be Green Lantern Corps with Red Lanterns not too far behind. Really with all the crossovers reading every GL book is like a must but those two in particular are very good imo you might want to skip to vol  of Red Lanterns however I mean I really didnt care for Atrocitus but Bleez made it a must for me Guy Gardner becoming a Red Lantern even more so since he is my favorite GL next to John Stewart. Other titles if youre interested in good writing and not necessarily the character Jeff Lemire wrote a great  Animal Man really made me like that character who wasnt even on my radar to be honest. Swamp Thing Earth  and Justice League are other titles which are consistently good and ones you may be interested in. You mentioned the Arkham games but have you played Injustice Gods Among Us? Because holy fuckballs are you in for a treat if you read the comic. Tom Taylor Earth  is doing a pretty good job on that comic lots of craziness and feels and its a selfcontained book so it has nothing to do with the New . If you want to read older stuff my reading suggestions are very limited to limited series and oneshots as I wasnt much of a comic book reader before the New . Ill add these titles at the bottom along with some current stuff which could go either way at the moment but ones I think are going to be really good. TLDRNew  Wonder Woman Batman  Animal Man series ended but Lemire has put him in the new Justice League United title Green Lantern Corps Red Lanterns  Swamp Thing Justice League Earth  Grayson Nightwing now working for Spyral  New Suicide Squad new team includes Harley Quinn Jokers Daughter Deadshot Deathstroke and Black MantaSelfcontained  Injustice Gods Among Us Sensation Comics featuring Wonder Woman a throwback there really isnt any linearity so you can just pick up any issue and enjoyPreNew  Catwoman Ed Brubaker run Wonder Woman George Perez run  Saga of Swamp Thing Alan Moore Animal Man Grant Morrison run havent read it personally but I hear it was the definitive Animal Man The Watchman Alan Moore The Dark Knight Returns Frank Miller The Killing Joke Alan Moore Batman Hush Jeph Loeb Batman The Long Halloween Jeph Loeb Kingdom Come Mark Waid DC The New Frontier Darwyn Cooke Superman for All Seasons Loeb AllStar Superman Grant Morrison Green Lantern Rebirth amp Blackest Night Geoff Johns SupermanBatman Public Enemies LoebThere is way more old stuff I could have probably mentioned but Im kind of limited to Batman and Superman stuff since those were my favorite heroes back then.

He respects CA too much as a national hero to fight with him.  And when someone asks why the Punisher didnt fight back... Spiderman says basically Dont you get it?  Captain American and the Punisher are essentially the same person both dedicated patriotic soldiers  but Captain fought in WWII and he fought in Vietnam. In any event... CA beating the crap out the Punisher did not show how trivial Punisher is.  The Punisher wasnt fighting back or resisting at all.  As for him hurting Caps side in the Civil War... a short time prior to receiving that onesided beating the Punisher had just saved SpiderMans life after the latter got ambushed in the sewer while in a weakened state.  Punisher shot those villains to save SpiderMan and Cap didnt like the fact that he used lethal force.

2067467,0,t3_2ij65s,Very happy to see a resonable list of six titles on my list for this week. AVENGERS amp XMEN AXIS   Ive been looking forward to this event for what feels like a long time. AvX and the opening arc of Remenders Uncanny Avengers provided a nice set up thats finally getting a chance to pay off in a big way. AVENGERS   The Original Sin tiein issues of Hickmans Avengers were arguably my favorite part of the event. The series has improved exponentially now that were back to the story Hickman has been telling from the beginning. BATMAN ETERNAL   Very very behind in my reading on this title.The weekly schedule just doesnt work for me. BATMAN   Great to see this book starting its next arc.

Its family friendly and it features a  year old Muslim girl named Kamala Khan discovering she is inhuman and getting crazy shape shifting powers. Its a great book that is entertaining because you can relate to the character. Shes a teenager before she is a superhero and its nice to see her dealing with teenage problems. The facts that she also comes from a different culture makes things a little more difficult or unfair for Kamala when it comes to associating with your average American teenager. You feel compelled to love Kamala right away because of how charming she is. The story is entertaining the whole way through and I would encourage anyone to read it. Just dont be too surprised if an  year old cannot fully grasp everything in the book.

Back when he was written by Finger and Kane he solved almost every problem with genuinely scientific solutions.

For instance it went forever having only part of Morrisons Animal Man run then when they were doing some New  promotion they added his full run and ran a  cent sale on it. So oftentimes you have to just bide your time keep yours eyes open and jump when there is a good deal. Like with the current Harley series that DC is running I could see them do a Harley sale at some point with say the first  issues if the current sale and all the old stuff as well. Actually thinking about it I think they did a Women of DC sale some time ago that had a lot of that. Anyways the point is you have to keep your eyes open. Monday Tuesday Friday Sat are the days new sales hit. So you just give a quick look and see if anything is up just takes a second. ,comicbooks,cljynca,1,t5_2qhon

Havent read them yet but the most blind of all the purchases I read a bit of and it really knocked my socks off as they say.And if you count buying trades I do this all the time. Wasteland by Johnston and Mitten I bought the first two volumes of. Still havent read it not a single word. Got Animal Man by Morrison in the omnibus and that was amazing. Bought a lot of Alan Moores complete Swamp Thing run in single issues on ebay for less than  right when I was first getting back into buying comics and of course it blew my mind. Hellblazer which im reading and loving now I had never read before buying the first six trades all at once when IST had them on sale. On the flip side I bought the Big Damn Sin City and didnt much care for it.I buy pretty much anything by some creators blind. I have bought a custom bound hardcover of Promethea  as well as the absolutes  and  and still have not read a page of any of it. I got the entire League set of books and fucking loved them. I have Jason Lutes Berlin that I am not even clear on what its about right now and probably wwasnt much clearer on it when I bought it because it was super cheap and I hear it is fantastic. I got Bendis s early crime stuff Jinx Goldfish and Torso and the most I have done is flip througb and think holy fuck I didnt think they meant he was THIS wordy. Um...I guess ill stop.

Ive done the same thing with wasteland and Im hoping that you can get to tell your full story in your image books just like that?A  Oh god yes well be fine.It used to be the case maybe ten years ago that tradewaiting could kill a series through low sales before the publisher had chance to issue the first collection.But those days are gone launching a standardformat series nowadays without taking tradewaiting into account is utterly foolish. Its the epitome of shortterm thinking.Now heres a little secret for you creators dont care what format you buy. Singles trades digital whatever all we care is that youre buying and enjoying the series. Please dont ever feel guilty because you think youre buying a book in the wrong format. There are no wrong formats. Youre the consumer.Hell I tradewait for many series myself. Ive been an outspoken advocate of the book market model for comics throughout my career and I walk that talk Ive written more OGNs original graphic novels than almost anyone else in the US industry. So believe me I understand.If you are waiting for the trade I ask only three things.One. If you can buy it from your local store instead of Amazon. Yes Amazon may be a couple bucks cheaper. But that  can be the difference between even having a local store or not.Two. Buy it the week its released. Better yet preorder it from the store. This is what can kill a series these days when people wait for the trade but then carry on waiting. Sales of Vol  are essential to the books health.Three. Tell your friends. Or even buy it for your friends as presents  but seriously word of mouth is the best way to spread the word about a series you like. Nothing will encourage someone to buy a book more than their friends telling them theyll enjoy it.In short its OK. Buy whatever format you like. So long as people keep buying well keep making comics ,comicbooks,clsp5at,15,t5_2qhon

As one he should have been a lot stronger than he was shown to be. But then the writers run into the problem of him being too powerful. So he defaults into a general strong man role that has absolutely no substance. Substitute Unstoppable Colossus for any other super strong character and very little would have changed.

2482250,0,t1_cmijoes,gtWow. Based on this statement you absolutely do not understand the point of Rorschach or the point of V. I dont think you get how much political posturing plays into Moores writing. gtRorschach is generally considered the protagonist of Watchmen. You spend the most time with him in the book and you follow him around doing things that are stereotypically done by heroes. He investigates crime scenes interrogates criminals and hes got an unsatisfiable hunger for justice. But heres the thing hes an insane fascist. You want to root for Rorschach throughout and depending on who you are you may end up doing so on my first read through I did but at the end once it is revealed how wrong Rorschach was you take a step back and realize how obvious it was that you should not have been rooting for this guy. Hes sick twisted deranged. Yet we find those qualities endearing in characters like Batman. Rorschach is like many of the other characters a commentary on the modern superhero. IIRC Rorschach doesnt do anything in the movies he didnt do in the comics besides slightly extended action scenes. And the dialogue is essentially verbatim. So I fail to see the huge difference.gtNo it doesnt. Dr. Manhattan wasnt a creation of mans imagination. Dr. Manhattan exists.None of the fears involved in Cold War anxiety didnt exist either.,comicbooks,cmikh2w,0,t5_2qhon

In it there is a family dealing with tragedy and facing enourmous loss! These people are real. There not bullet proof and they dont shoot lasers from there eyes they just try and live in the world created for them. The stakes are only ever high for super heros at Marvel and DC. When was the last time a comic from the big two turned its head away from the heroes to concentrate on the people dealing with these events? I cant think of one right now so I may be wrongCreator owned has real stakes real tension they can kill any character they want and there is no chance he will be reborn by time travel or some parralell world or a fucking pirate ship in heaven.

This would be good if she just likes the idea of a lady thief. Batman Hush  Shes a secondary character in this but this would be good if she likes the BatmanCatwoman relationship.  The Dark End of the Street  This was the first arc in a new direction on Catwoman in . She becomes kind of an antihero wears a more practical costume and beats up bad guys. This would be good if she likes the idea of an asskicking lady in a cool costume. When in Rome  This is more the sexy femme fatale Catwoman in the form fitting purple costume with thighhigh boots. The art is very cheesecakey but if she likes the idea of a bad girl temptress itd make a good choice.Edit Ooh ugamermaker is right I didnt know Brubakers run got recollected.

Similarly Infinite Crisis and  may have reintroduced the Multiverse but they told their own interesting stories apart from that.

2666346,0,t1_cn6hddb,The movies also make people interested in the comics.  So someone watching the movies will start reading about Captain Marvel the only current Captain Marvel Carol Danvers.Carol Danvers is a more interesting character to write about.  She is also an easier character to connect earth with the rest of the cosmos since unlike MarVell has Earth origins and is an actual Avenger.  It just makes more sense to include her as part of the MCU and it would work better altogether.  Not to mention its so much that Marvel wanted a Captain Marvel movie as much as it was about introducing their first female superhero film.  The obvious pick was Carol Danvers who as you said just got renamed Captain Marvel a couple years back.  Introducing a new female superhero into the mix that can quite literally kick as much ass as the super powered males is something new that hasnt been seen before in the MCU.

2704378,0,t1_cnbf0w1,For your first question its partly because the writers dont own the characters and partly because at this point many of the superhero characters are modern myths. There is no real Batman only many different interpretations on what he is. This is why Batman can seem very different from one creator to the next.Personally I find this more interesting than if he was the same for the last  years. If he was hed still be running around with purple gloves on shooting people. And how do they keep it all cohesive? Well sometimes they just dont. Like XMen there are so many screwed up things in that continuity itll give you a headache if you think about it too long.And for the pencillerinkercolorist. Its broken down into multiple jobs because artists cant keep up a monthly schedule if they take on all three usually.

Issues  and  are especially good  Joe Kelly deserves some kind of Most Improved Supervillain award for his Rhino.Also if you dug SSM I recommend Chris Yosts Scarlet Spider. It has a lot of parallels with SSM  Kaine a former villain with a terminal condition suddenly finds himself in possession of a perfect Peter Parker clone body. He takes up crimefighting but with more pragmatic and sometimes more brutal methods than Peter. Hes done a lot of awful things and now hes trying to redeem himself.A couple of things that are good to know about Kaine in Scarlet Spider  . Hes wearing a stealthsonic suit Peter designed in Big Time. . He has some of Spideys powers from The Other storyline including organic webbing and wrist stingers. . He doesnt have Spider Sense.,comicbooks,cnds6fe,1,t5_2qhon

2760562,0,t1_cndoqed,He did from Amazing Fantasy  and Amazing Spidey .Its there in the print interviews with Stan Lee and is part of what makes Marvel Marvel the social realism Lee and others injected into their characters that them distinguished from the stodgystick in the mud dad comics of DC at the time who then were forced to basically evolve or die in response to Marvels amazing sales and their own shit sales and declining interest in their characters at the time. I also love DC dont see that as an insult.Granted it has always been part of the character I mean Ive read the first  issues of Amazing and pretty much every major defining eventstory from spidey in s.But classic spidey also had fun it was not a non stop cavalcade of more depressing fucked up shit with no sign of hope just endless desperation and the death of the old character metaphorically although one time he was killed by Thanos in the s SpiderMan title.If I want relentlessly bleak Ill read Allan Moore or Warren Ellis because they can do bleak and dreary well amongst other things and they even manage to throw in some black humour at the same time something that I didnt really feel with the JMS run. I dont really care for that in a SpiderMan comic when it becomes the main thing instead of like  down in the dumps spidey in the overall delicious pie chart of SpiderMan.  When that pie chart goes above  depressing that Spidey is one I dont want to read.They did depressing Spidey another time in the s when he staid in the costume constantly and he went all feral Daredevil was wearing his grey costume at the time.I agree with what you are saying and have intentionally overexaggerated to make my point.Im not against the idea of a depressing Spidey comic but given it is one of the few comics left that appeals to a younger audience it could not hurt to lighten the tone a bit.But hey every writer is going to add or take away something from a character and the reader votes with their wallet so nobody loses in that sense.You can do real world and depressing and all that in a comic but few writers do it well and I do find it is a lazy way to write.  I prefer fun loving wise cracking Spidey without  years of emotional baggage that fills up the wordthought balloons so much that there is barely room for any dialogue.If theres going to be the odd issue like oh no Harry is doing Heroin or whatever have it mean something and not be there just for shock value that story did mean something in that it was social commentary and not just a gimmick to sell a book although Stan has always been a  good salesmanspromoter first and story teller second imo. ,comicbooks,cnhv5q9,1,t5_2qhon

We dont really  need to have all the tidbits from that  point filled in because the point of this issue  was just to give us some backstory on a secondary character  who is now a lot more intriguing mission accomplished. ,comicbooks,cnpkytc,3,t5_2qhon

2903896,0,t1_cny53z5,Interesting premise for the VictorianEdwardian setting. Have you read any of the D Goggles comics? Theyre pretty fun. I havent read Curvy. Ill give Chester an opportunity over some reading to win me over or not.Its interesting the absence of text in the comics Ive read so far has seemed to make the content of the comics more explicitly visible. Action adventure connection novelty eroticism sympathy whatever the focuses  they become more apparent in the design of the imagery. Its like as intervening detail is tossed out the comics lose this as a supporting structure and have to rely on delivering and emphasizing the core of their flavorsubstance.And as a reader youre confronted with the recognition of this nature. Then when what youre seeking is unmasked do you choose to continue to consume it? For instance if glory pornography love exclusivity etc. are undisguised and at the fore is it an indulgent or gluttonous experience to read on? If the experience of the content is giving you your fill what inside yourself decides when youre satisfied  and how does that shape you? These are interesting questions to me and Ive been picking at them for a while.So I think what it comes down to is that Ill like this comic or other content if it doesnt feel like a gratuitous delivery of the emotional essences it serves in other words not emotional masturbationfan service. Not that indulgence isnt nice now and again but I wouldnt want to eat such a dessert with every meal or even every day.,comicbooks,cny6g7z,2,t5_2qhon

Marvel is putting Black Widow everywhere still waiting for a movie and the problem with WW is that mainstream have a such diffirent scope of ideas of what WW should be that it would be hard to create a WW movie that would make at least the majority of people happy unless you go with Rucka or Azzarellos version but I guarantee some people would still bitch about that. ,comicbooks,co71ztf,14,t5_2qhon

If Emma Frost gained superstrength would that kind of flashy frontline battling suit her ego or would she still prefer the more dignified methods shes accustomed to? In either possibility what does she do with that feeling?With Superman though the skys already the limit. Its kind of like Well I could do anything I wanted and I guess I still can do anything I want but Ive got an extra tool at my disposal for that now.That the article says its a destructive power is just even less promising. Superman can already do destruction really really well in multiple ways.Of course who knows they could legitimately have some awesome story planned but Im just saying where my mind goes when I see this sort of publicity.

3013850,0,t3_2uoh22,Im pretty bitter about the New  but not really because of the concept of rebooting. I thought they just handled it poorly for a lot of their characters. Not all the origin stories were completely redone but for the ones that were I was either lukewarm on them or didnt like them.A lot of the big names got pretty good treatment. Batman Wonder Woman Aquaman and The Flash all had great stories right out of the gate. And it was good for some comics with darker feels too like Animal Man Swamp Thing Justice League Dark or the weird but I found it entertaining I Vampire. They took a lot of risks which I appreciated.The problem was they also threw out a lot that worked and brought in a lot of creators whose work I either dont like or who did work that was outwardly bad. And since they were responsible for establishing the status quo of the characters new backstories and all most of the characters who got screwed at the outset havent recovered since even with new creative teams the damage done to Teen Titans and Red Hood cant really be undone without ignoring the writing thats been done already.tldr  It couldve worked in theory and did work for some but overall I was disappointed because of a poor handling of the characters more than because the continuity was thrown out.,comicbooks,coadtw7,2,t5_2qhon

3239709,0,t3_2x6h4r,There are basically two major differences between Manga and American Comics henceforth just called comics. The creative team behind a manga is often just one or two people doing nothing but that title. Its more often just one person both writing and drawing everything basically on their own meaning theres a very coherent singular narrative. Manga are generally a singular narrative. When a manga ends its over. Comics are generally more about characters and while arcs and storylines may have solid beginnings and endings the characters and their shared universe will continue on.Each of these has its ups and downs. The nearsingle creative control behind most manga means theres often a much tighter more focused narrative throughout the series. It can read more like a novel series than single stories of a character. The downside is that things like crossovers shared universes or new art almost always do not exist. And if a writer leaves or decides they dont want to work on a title its simply... done. Its very rare a cancelled or stopped manga will ever get picked up again let alone by someone else. It also means that once the story is done its pretty much done. The continuation or other adventures of the characters are rare to find outside of other adaptions.This is not absolute  there are manga subject to things like editorial oversight or multiple creatures and there are comics with single teams and are built around a singular tight narrative.TLDR  Comics tend to focus on snapshots of characters that have existed and will continue to exist. Manga focus on a complete narrative with a solid beginning and end and thats it.Mostly again nothing is absolute.,comicbooks,coxswi1,2,t5_2qhon

The only saving grace the franchise has is that Hemsworth and Hiddleston are both very charismatic actors and likeable.

I hear theres uh... this good new restaraunt down town... by the way I ran into Cindy last week... There would also be a very high chance of inside jokes and references that no one reading would have any way of understanding. You specifically called out stutters in other words filler like uh and um and topic changes as things that real dialogue has that are being left out here and good fictional dialogue leaves those things out too because theyre terrible to read unless theyre actually conveying something important about the conversation. In fictional dialogue if you see the word um it implies something like the person ran out of things to say is stumped or flabbergasted. In the real world the word um is a part of almost every conversation because thats just a part of how people talk. Your fictional dialogue should not have meaningless filler or irrelevant topic changes unless youre using them to say something about the person talking. As for you example A Hello... is more formal than B Hey.... Thats the primary difference. A person might realistically say A to their boss but probably not to their friend and vice versa. If the dialogue in the comic comes off as stiff and formal to you thats fine although I disagree but the criticism that its not how people actually talk doesnt make any sense because the written word is never how people actually talk. I hate to repeat myself but do you think that Shakespeares dialogue is bad? Or that it was bad in the s? Do you think people actually talked like that in his time? Do you think what makes dialogue good or bad has changed in the few hundred years since he wrote? It matters that modern dialogue sounds like how people talk in modern times but it doesnt matter if s dialogue doesnt sound like how people talked in the s?,comicbooks,cp6qqda,1,t5_2qhon

3323667,0,t3_2y2lrh,The issues that Superman faces is indicative of the glaring issues that DC has continued to face for decades now. It isnt that audiences have outgrown the character or that he is too good for us. To over simplify matters would be to say that DC has failed as a publisher to reinvent its overall approach to their iconic lineup of characters for the sake of modern storytelling sensibilities.In the s and s there was an editorial effort at DC to reinvigorate their lineup to reflect what they perceived was Marvels key to success. Batman returned to a more pulpish tone and style even more so after Frank Miller got to work on the character. Sociopolitical tales were weaved into heroics in books like Green LanternGreen Arrow. They even began a focus on more serialized tales DC maintained their traditional oneanddone paradigm for quite some time.Despite some successful retoolings the overall product line was still falling short of that being done at Marvel. A big reason for that is this continued issue of refusing to really do anything different with the characters. Yes some Elseworld tales have since seen some unique spin on the concepts but generally writers are incredibly limited as to where they can take these iconic characters.Notice that the vast majority of work from DC is very plot driven rather than character driven. A Batman or Superman story is more often than not all about the events occurring on the page rather than the impact it has on the characters. How often do we see the day in the life of Bruce Wayne the psychologically and emotionally damaged man? How often do we see a story where we explore how lonely and broken a man Bruce is?This doesnt happen by editorial design. The characters are sealed away from such explorations for fear of tarnishing their iconic imagery.Now compare this to the work at Marvel where many of their stories are actually about the characters themselves. We see the lives of the Fantastic Four at home how their relationships with each other and others effect them both personally and out in the field. Peter Parker is an emotional roller coaster and his life sometimes has him making some questionable decisions. He makes mistakes. He suffers. And others suffer. They grow and change. Not always permanent but layers and wrinkles are certainly added.The key to great character work is to dig deep flesh them out to the point where they arent simply characters but people. Highs and lows. Strengths and weaknesses. Hopes and dreams. Selfish desires.People will point to AllStar Superman as a high point but all it does is celebrate the icon rather than expand upon him. It is a time capsule a love letter to the icon we all know and love...and ultimately reject for being so twodimensional.There are many sides to a person and the best character work reflects this. With Marvel superheroes there are often  major faces the colorful costumed hero the public identity and the real man beneath it all. SpiderMan is witty and mostly beloved by the public. Peter Parker is often seen as a slacker lazy and unreliable. But the real Peter is underneath all that. Both are masks for that scared shy kid from Forrest Hills who still misses his Uncle Ben.DC characters lack this third side or at least it is rarely if ever allowed to be shown.For Batman there is the cold calculating and obsessed detective the affluent yet entirely fictional playboy persona and the scarred lonely young boy who never truly got over the death of his parents. But we never really see that tortured boy only the cool and iconic badass who always wins.And then there is Superman and mild mannered Clark Kent. The god and his goofy cover story. But there should be Clark the small town kid from Kansas with his own hopes and dreams and fears. This Clark exists or should exist beneath that outter heroic smile. Beneath that slouch and glasses and clumsy stumble. This is the man we need to identify with a man who struggles to be what the world wants and needs while somehow allowing himself to be a tad bit selfish like any normal person. Remember he isnt a god. Hes a man who happens to have godlike abilities. Even the Krytponians had their faults. They had needs and wants selfish or otherwise. But even while he was born KalEl he was raised his entire life as a boy named Clark. He went to local schools. Had crushes. Felt loss and jealousy. He isnt perfect he just does his best to live up to an ideal.This is why Captain America has remained rather relevant all these years even more so in the last decade or so. He was a golden age character just like Superman. A living icon of truth justice and the American Way. But hes also been allowed to be Steve Rogers the man faults and all. Hes made mistakes. Hes been selfish. Hes been more man than myth.And thats the problem with Superman. He can crush a piece of coal into a diamond. He can fly around the Earth so fast he can turn back time. He can shoot lasers and fly and even go supernova all he wants. He can be the myth and icon for truth and justice. Thats what makes him Superman and why he has continued to endure when so many others faded into obscurity. But to make him relevant requires allowing writers to share with readers the man behind the legend. The man inside all that. Show us that despite having all the powers in creation despite fighting off even death itself there is still that flustered farm boy afraid that he might not save the world the next time. A man who wishes to live a quiet life with a wife and family in a world that doesnt need Superman. ,comicbooks,cp74jn0,3,t5_2qhon

Unlike Hawkeye and SpiderWoman and Thor and the list goes on the first issue leaves her completely alone.

I would highly recommend SpiderMan Blue Daredevil Yellow and Hulk Grey because the art and writing in all of them LoebSale is phenomenal and the stories are incredibly pathos driven rehashes of established events for classic heroes. Batman Year One and The Dark Knight Returns are classics in the Batman direction and I would highly recommend Superman for All Seasons SaleLoeb again AllStar Superman and Superman Secret Identity as great stories about Superman that show him in some of the best lights. I personally enjoyed Superman Red Son but it was much less to me about a message or moral and more of just a fun what if tale still a great read all the same. Kinski is a bit newer but is a really funquirky little read about how far this one dude is willing to go to get a dog. Seeing as Civil War is about to get big Marvel Civil War will most likely be a must and is one of the comics that got me into the medium presently. The Scott Pilgrim series  volumes is also an incredibly fun read and the first trade of AllNew Ghost Rider is fun purely for the protagonist and art. Lastly please look into Jeff Lemire. His works are some of my favorites and while they can be fairly graphic at points they rarely delve into the realms of excess or traumatizing. Underwater Welder and Sweet Tooth are incredibly sweet endearing and focus alot on familial relationships through blood andor otherwise and carry alot of emotion with them for sure.Hope this helps!,comicbooks,cp99wbr,1,t5_2qhon

The thing about what happens to Babs in The Killing Joke and that is recalled here is that the violence done to her doesnt have anything to do with who she is or the choices she makes. Shes victimized and stripped of power due to her relationship to another character in fact its not even her relationship to James Gordon thats important but Gordons relationship to Batman. Shes not important enough to be taken out on her own merit. Shes not even important enough to be taken out as a tool to hurt Gordon Shes literally used as third hand collateral to hurt Batman. This is the difference in how male and female heroes are put in jeopardy. And female characters being killed or depowered to hurt a male character is indeed a staple of comic books,comicbooks,cpfmj9v,-7,t5_2qhon

But there have been death threats and enormous amounts of vitiriol and general shit flung at DC and the artist. I can stop you from denying that that had anything to do with it but its wilfully ignorant nonetheless.And the fact that virtually no one in this thread has complain just strengthens my point.

3421493,0,t1_cpi9e4e,Lets be fair here however.  Her trauma left far greater physical scars and a longer impact on her life.  Im not necessarily putting emotional trauma beneath physical but her paralysis did have greater implications.  It wasnt something you could ignore or hide in any capacity.Even at the end of things Jim Gordon in tears remained resolute that the Joker be brought in by the book.  He had emotional scars.  He would recover to an extent.  But its clear he was even worse off when the Joker shot his second wife to the point that he shot the Joker in the knee after hed been apprehended.Thats kind of it.  The Joker when he actually manages to land a shot is usually a sobering experience for the Bat Family. It happened when Dick Grayson was shot by the Joker and Batman made him quit forcing Dick out into the Teen Titans.  That defined him for years.It happened when Jason Todd was killed by the Joker.  Batman became a loner and a darker figure that needed Tim Drake to balance him.  For Todd he channeled it into his existing anger which he took out on the Joker when he returned as the Red Hood taking a mantle previously owned by his own killer.  His experience with the Joker still informs his concept of justice.Of course it would define her for years.  She was disabled by him.  She had to forge an entire career out of that one act.  The way Dick Grayson had to forge his own path from the Joker shooting him.  The way Jason Todd lost Batmans influence and became the Red Hood.  Theyre all carrying scars inflicted by that madman and they are part of who they are.To say the Joker and what he is to Barbara is to ignore what he did.  What he was capable of.  The Batman still takes Bane very seriously even if the writers dont but then no one takes Venom seriously anymore either.Whats it mean to people bearing similar scars when you basically erase what happened as if it never did.  That you never provide insight into a character that is not ignoring but coping with what their tormentor did to them?,comicbooks,cpi9x2i,20,t5_2qhon

I usually have the source image on my ipad next to the computer screen but sometimes I will drop the opacity on the source and overlay it to do a check on proportions. It helps me train my eye and hone my craftsmanship. If youre able to draw the shapes that create reflections and shadows anyone could create these paintings! I have noticed a dramatic increase in my copic marker abilities after doing all these digital studies. You can see some of my blank sketch cover work here!Im very aware of what is required to do digital art especially fully painted digital art what this is vs. photo manipulated digital art what this is not.It doesnt change the fact that every image has been photo referenced more like outright copied including the aforementioned reflections in Spideys eyes not to mention the entirety of Spidey himself.And unlike most people who dont understand painting or never see good painting I am not impressed by copies of photos no matter how good the brushwork.So people can downvote me and you can explain things that I already know to me.

3445460,0,t3_2zoy0q,Ive looked at the Batgirl relaunch as a book set in a college setting to be aimed at teens in the same way that the kind of teen stories youd see on Nickelodeon aimed at the age  set.   It seems consciously designed to be a gateway comic to attract new readers especially younger female readers.   As an adult male with younger sisters in the age group the book seems to be written for when I read the book I feel as if it almost panders to that audience a little and I personally havent been able to get into the book too much.  but they did sucker me into buying a few issues with the Darwyn Cooke cover and the Purple Rain cover and reading it.   Its good its just not for me.  Its designed with a certain audience in mind and I am not a part of that audience.    And thats okay.If they want to not publish a cover that recalls Batgirl being the victim of a sexual crime that was meant to run on an issue of the series that is marketed to younger girls and empowering for Batgirl it really shouldnt be as big of a deal as people are making it.     This shouldnt be an issue of comparing it to Jason Todd or anything else.   And this also isnt the SJWs winning.   This is an artist and a corporate publishing company realizing that they were planning on publishing something that in context would have been in bad taste and pulling the plug on it before it happened.   If you like that piece of art that much you can look at it anywhere on the Internet    It exists and its out there.   If you need a hard copy you can probably find a highenoughresolution image and print it out yourself.   People need to stop being so possessive about characters that belong to everyone and stop telling new younger readers that they arent welcome at this table.   The comics industry is only going to keep existing if new people start buying and reading the books.   If DC wants to be polite to those readers by not running the rapey Joker cover on an issue of Batgirl people are going to have to get over it.   Itll be reprinted somewhere some time guaranteed.   Probably in a future trade paperback or hardcover along with an explanation caption as a bonus featuredeleted scene.   If you want more Killing Joke just read Killing Joke again.   It is still in print and is probably never going away in that regard.   Every reread reveals something new.    Because it is still a great comic.   edited for format and a little bit of phrasing,comicbooks,cpl0aro,4,t5_2qhon

3468993,0,t1_cpnkcwm,gt Alright had time to sit down and read your argument and watch your video in its entirety. Id like to address the entire body of your argument and if this continues maybe I will but for now Ill stick to Thor and Odinson.Fair enough gt The argument that is brought up time and time again is she isnt canon. You mention Spiderman not being able to fly well actually for short time periods he has had that ability when he was Captain Universe. It was a brief stent but it happened. I cant comment on DC canon Ill have to trust you bc Ive never read DC. The point here is that sometimes the writers go outside the norm or canon to shake things up like Spiderman having flight the ability to breath in space and cosmic blasts? when he was Captain Universe but once that served its purpose he was returned to the friendly neighborhood spider we all know.Thats a entirely different situation in which spidey actually had a new identity and powerset. A better example would be to point to a creative run in which spiderman was spiderman and had the ability to fly. Its not a valid counterargument for the same reason superman bluered arent.gt Ill continue with the argument of canon and ask how is she not canon at this point? Before we get to her taking his name lets look at her story because a lot of people like to say she is a gimmick but then completely forget about Thor Odinsons story in GoT. In GoT we see three versions of Thor young current and old Thorforce wielding Thor Odinson. Something very important happens especially regarding future Thor he has lost an arm. If this future self is to truly be Thors fate Thor is going to lose an arm. So why is this important? Well in the next few chapters Thor becomes the God of Gods. We see his young unworthy self his old tired self but we get to see Thor become the savior of the Gods. Then Original Sin happens. Nick Fury whispers something and Mjolnir drops to the moon like a sack of uru potatoes. Thor doesnt know why Mjolnir wont answer to him but he clearly is rocked to his core by this. He was just on cloud nine the universe was loving them some Thor and then smack. A whisper took his self worth. Now he goes off looking for a purpose a fight and he comes upon a certain dark elf that slices right through that old arm of his and suddenly our Thor Odinson is looking a lot like the future Thor.I never said she wasnt canon and that isnt the argument anyone is making. We are saying she ruins canon because whenever someone has wielded thors power they still keep their own identity. For instance when nightwing became batman he didnt also become Bruce Wayne he stayed dick Greyson. Its fine if she had thorlike powers and a thorlike outfit...but to actually have his birth name too is pushing the boundaries of common sense and established canon.gt At the end of GoT the daughters find a book and old Thor loses his shit over it and tells the girls to scoot! He looks down at the book and we see that the wielder of Mjolnir had changed this was some book he wanted hidden its the female Thor! It was a time of great change. A time when heroes fell and worlds burned. A time of war and sacrifice of upheaval. Of cosmic decay. A time when even the greatest of all the Gods was laid low. Thats from the last few panels of GoT. People keep saying this was a PR move but this was planned. That text references everything that is happening in the MU right now with the incursions with Thors hammer and with so much changing.Again the story isnt in question its the fact that she not only took his powers but his birth name. gt All of this was planned. From Thors arm gone in issue one of GoT FemThor was already in the making. We just didnt get an inkling of her story bc she was intended to be a big reveal. Shes still a mystery to us. She will be revealed soon enough but her story and Odinsons are not two completely different stories but two intertwining. He needs this time to be unworthy so he can ascend again...and he will. Not bc I say so but bc GoT said so bc at the end of her run we know Thor ends up with Mjolnir again. Oh and bc they tend to like their movie characters being recognizable in their comic books as well and hes got a new movie in Thor Ragnorok.Im aware of the story and that isnt the topic of discussion.gt Now you can argue all you want about her keeping his name. I figured since Thor didnt possess his power he felt he didnt deserve his name and she took it up as if it were a mantle and not just his birth name. Because he has existed in some really weird ways as stated in the youtube video you linked for her to just call herself Thor doesnt seem like that big a deal. I have a feeling not all the cards are on the table yet and just because it doesnt make sense now doesnt mean it wont in the future. Isnt that what story telling is? If you knew everything youd lose a sense of wonder or those big reveal moments. I say let the book run its course and after Battleworld and Secret Wars we will see who holds the hammer.Her keeping his birth name is a problem...the video I linked went into detail explaining now all the wielders of thors power kept their identities and names. Her being called thor which is a birth name is a issue and this doesnt even get into the logic of gender swapping for the sake of pandering.,comicbooks,cpnov0z,3,t5_2qhon

I wasted too much money on AXIS to just dive into events all willynilly. SpiderGwen  This series is just gorgeous. Im glad Marvel gave us this book without interfeering too much. SupermanWonder Woman  Is this arc still going on? I feel like its been dragging for ages it feels like Bendis is writing this arc. Teen Titans Annual  This book may get cut soon I think ive been giving it a pass because I love Rocafort on art but I have to admit its only an above average book. Uncanny Inhumans  Ill totally pick this up. Soule is amazing and Steve McNiven is one of my favorites. I should catch up on Soules Inhumans run anyways I dropped that due to delays. Wonder Woman  I really wanted to hate this book... but I actually like this new creative team.

Ruin art for everybody because you have no idea what youre talking about. It looked to me like hes done something terrible and just making her look at it like sending the pictures of her to her father. The Joker loves showing off this was a perfect homage to that ground breaking story. In my opinion Barbara Gordon has always been better as the Oracle so I think the Joker made her into her best self. Strong survivor and making Alfreds life easier. Without the Killing Joke she never would have become that character that was amazing in her own way she was a strong symbol for the wheelchair bound what was wrong with that? Why does every female have to be an ass kicker with powers greater than any man? Even as a collector of Joker covers I know there are much more disturbing covers already out there and in my possession. The Joker is not meant to be funny to anyone but himself I can tell you thats the one consistent thing about the Joker from Batman  until now so anyone with the arm of the Joker around you and in that hand is a large gun anyone SHOULD be terrified man or woman or superhero.

We all know how important FF was for revitalising superhero comics so for his influence on that and for completely revamping the DC line Julie Schwartz is my pick.Also Denny ONeil shepherded one of the best periods of Batman continuity in the s. Knightfall and No Mans Land were put out when he was the head of the Bat department. He was also the editor on Batman Year One.

3615982,0,t1_cq4dl16,Ive posted this up somewhere else but its the best answer I can come up with in regards to race casting in comic booksIt simply comes down to this Demographics and marketing.As time as gone on comics well all forms of entertainment media have done their best to reflect what the audience wants to see. We all complain about Fox News CNN MSNBC female Thor current booking in the WWE changing the cover of Batgirl for the cover AND against it etc. It should be noted that when I say we Im referring to the collective conscious of the human race.However all those organizations like them or hate them have an idea they want to convey and do what they can to get it because MONEY.In media Ive always found race changing to be a nonfactor but Im willing to bet a lot of that comes from my background of being  black  white Obama black at the age . People are people and as long as the story is smart informed and doesnt betray my intelligence then Im willing to give it a shot.DC changes characters all the times. Theres a million universes a million personalities and a million different aliases for the same character. When Kyle Rainer was tapped to be a new Green Lantern nobody really batted an eyelid imagine if Jon Stewart with the internet as it is being tapped to be the new Green Lantern today?Flash has changed names and personalities the Batman cowl has been worn by different people weve had multiple Green Arrows etc...and the backlash to those events usually come along the lines of I love the current person and I dont want the new guy!So when Ultimate SpiderMan dies in  and the guy who had made all the decisions on that entire series decided to bring in a new blackhispanic kid...we get the backlash. Thats my point If you can stomach Barry Allen and Wally West two separate individuals sharing one character then it should be just as easy to have a SpiderMan that has to be more wary of police officers then the other one.TLDR Michael Clark Duncan was the best casting choice in the Daredevil movie because thats the power of getting the right guy for the right job.However Im completely with your sentiment that a black producer working on it will bring a better take then your typical Hollywood producer. My big fear for Luke Cage was for it to be turned into Dolemite. I like Dolemite and happen to like a lot of Blaxpoitation movies for what they are.But Luke Cage?

The Legenderry Vampirella wears a more modest and period appropriate costume and is a nightclub owner not a fulltime monsterslayer. There have been a lot of variations on Vampirella over the years. In issue  I finally reveal somewhat which origin story I prefer. One word Draculon. And with that comes a more science fictional and less supernatural take on the character. Thats partially because of the frame of the story steampulppunk and partially my own prejudices and preferences.Finally my Vampirella is influenced by a lifetime of admiring kickass women and I love writing a character who literally kicks ass.,comicbooks,cqddsj0,3,t5_2qhon

Wilson Fisk is a murderer who cant be stopped because he has paid out the media and police force. When would a person in real life be against a vigilante killing him?I cant even tell you ho many times Ive seen moms on Facebook freak out when a rape happens in the city and say that the rapist should be killed or maimed or whatever.People are not as against the killing of bad people as these shows like to pretend and when they force these values on characters that the viewer is supposed to relate to or just enjoy it feels out of place.,comicbooks,cqfm6un,0,t5_2qhon

3715678,0,t3_32x8e3,I think that everyone here is competent enough to find the leaked material themselves so not having it on here is perfectly acceptable. I know we all enjoy watching those things but I personally wouldnt want to contribute to stealing which is what leaks generally are stealing from an employerartist and releasing without consent. As much as we like to see the content and judge it it is not ethical and also may not be a reflection of the final product causing hiccups where negative feedback leads to a potentially good idea being abandoned.Obviously there are counterarguments such as the leaked deadpool test footage leading to the project getting greenlit but I think that we all have enough initiative to find the content elsewhere. Even if it feels good to see the content here it isnt worth potentially damaging the industry we love and it can be really frustrating for the artists involved when their content is leaked without their approval. However I dont think photos that people take of show sets is necessarily in the same ethical area. It is the right of that person to take a photo of their own and distribute it assuming they havent signed anything saying otherwise.,comicbooks,cqftapx,2,t5_2qhon

None of the shots felt like trailer shots looking at you Snyder what little we see of the characterization seems in line with the books Reed bores Sue Johnny cracks wise Doom is weird and too serious around others the action looks like we can follow it but more important than that for me is the emphasis on exploration and broadening horizons. That for me is the core of the FF. Not the blue suits not their age not Johnnys race and not even a lighthearted tone. These are explorers people who get turned on by knowledge. Forget Ultron AntMan or even Star Wars. As far as Im concerned this is the mustsee blockbuster of .,comicbooks,cqi4j0f,8,t5_2qhon
3736389,0,t1_cqi4wt8,He was accused of not having some social justice values truthfully by an angry mob of people who do have those particular social justice values.  Mozilla was hounded into firing him.  The person I was responding to claimed nobody got fired because a mob of SJWs demanded it.  He did.He was their cofounder so they obviously must have known about his political leanings if they were at all relevant to how he conducts himself professionally.  If he successfully compartmentalizes his personal and professional life he shouldnt have been fired IMO.  If he had started making company policy to be antiGSM Id have had little problem with the outrage as I had no problem with the outrage at CFA.  But he wasnt even given a chance.  It was way too much like McCarthyism to me.

3737238,1,t1_cqi7gko,gt not that i disagree that diversity is goodI think the problem with diversity in comics is that its to often forced amp lacks for anything beyond hey look we have a insert name of group minority here characterbook.Take Mighty Avengers for instance This book has literally no reason to exist as it has no narrative purpose because they stopped the second they came up with the idea ethnic Avengers.They could have taken those same characters looked at the books they were already putting out amp created a different book with those same characters a book that actually had a narrative purpose.Or female Thor. It had this giant push by being announced on the View but the actual book is terrible because outside of she has Mjolnir amp she has lady parts the character brings nothing new or at all to the table. Where as Silk on the other hand did more in her first issue to build a solid foundation than FemThor has for her entire book run so far. An only one of these books wasnt marketed amp sold on the basis of appealing to false diversity.,comicbooks,cqi9ppy,-2,t5_2qhon

That and the Avengers amp the XMen failing to respect each other enough to talk it out of which theres plenty of blame on both sides.You can keep saying it was a threat but it wasnt. This was a very specific previously recorded phenomena of the Phoenix coming to work with a Phoenix Messiah and her Five Lights to break an antievolution spell. It had happened before on other planets the mutants knew about it and that this is why it was coming they had been told about it by many millennia old being from space. Hope with proper support had the capability to be an effective host which we saw at the end of the arc.There certainly was risk but less risk than trying to fight a cosmic force of the universe even with the Avengers amp XMen working together.dont get me wrong considering the limited info they had its reasonable that the Avengers thought it was a threat. they made the best decision they could. and I can even see why they wouldnt want to listen to Scott he was pretty fanatical. but in the end Scott was right and it was their mistake,comicbooks,cqjhwb9,3,t5_2qhon

Would the same situation have happened if a well trained registered group of heros had handled the situation? Possibly but said group probably also wouldnt have attacked someone as dangerous as Nitro in a residential area. Itd be like if someone found out about a domestic terror group making a bomb inside a house and decided to raid the place rather than call the cops. If the bomb explodes then you bet your ass the gungho wannabe hero is partially to blame just as he would be worthy of praise if he had STOPPED the bomb but if that was truly his intention then he wouldve notified the proper authorities rather than run in himself. ,comicbooks,cqpx4pd,1,t5_2qhon

Look at the crazy kinds of comics are coming out nowadays that market to so much more people. all the stuff coming from Kaboom! for kids The Wicked  the Divine has crazy awesome fashion and makeup for the ladies and then super funny comics like Chew.

Snyder uses a subtle touch taking old themes and twisting them and it can be hard to see the distinctions.

US comics are about carrying the character along and adapting him to each age passing through dozens of writers and artists if not hundreds. Thats how it works and if you dont like that then you really shouldnt be reading big two superhero books. There is a time and place for finite storytelling American superhero comics are not that cant be that. ,comicbooks,cr314ob,1,t5_2qhon

Steph as a mess of daddy issues ft. her actual father and her Batdad. Steph as someone with her history being Spoiler and CONTINUOUSLY being wrong trying and trying so hard to do in the right thing but needing support. Stephgirl was her finally getting that support and making something of it. Never felt disconnected from her mistakes from the past she wasnt the perfect hero.Simones Babgirls was... not this stereotype. Had its own issues. Her survivors guilt was interesting. Shoddy writing and being cursed by the Nu all let it down.Camerons Babgirls is just completely disconnected from anything  from any flaw in her character history. Perfect hero.

More of the mutagen stuff is addressed once more mutants are added to the story and you see more of what Stockgen was doing and why.It is mentioned I dont know if its earlier or later how quickly they picked up on the ninja stuff and it is pretty much like muscle memory from the reincarnation.

3947600,0,t1_cr650pk,No not at all.Marvel has some of the most distinct artists going right now as they like to plunder anyone who does good indie stuff.  The only books that really look very similar are the AvengersNew Avengers books as they are very tightly connected.Even then Avengers World has a different style Secret Avengers does too.Ghost Rider had some CRAZZYYY stylish art. HawkeyeMs. Marvel.Young Avengers.Squirrel Girl.Silver Surfer.Moon Knight.The Xbooks have a rotating bank of artists who all have fairly unique styles to things.Humberto Ramaros on Spiderman.hell even Deadpool had some Tony Moore art.Marvel tends to let their current creative teams just run with a book even though they are bad at keeping them for more than a year.   DC has a very strong house style now. Like I am amazed that The Flash and the midseries reboot of Green Arrow happened there. They are EXTREMELY consistent across most of the books they put out since the reboot.  Its great for a sense of continuity but it gives everything a samey vibe and when the model sheets for all of the characters are basically THE SAME BODY go look at Justice League  Superman Batman The Flash Green Lantern Aquaman and Cyborg all have the same body and faces with different skintones and haircuts and costumes.

Im only a few in and it is a little hoakie but I am enjoying it. Carnage seems like the Joker on steroidsJokers m.o. being chaos Carnages is straight mayhem. Before that I read God Loves Man Kills which is beautiful. Before that I read the  part Hawkeye series from the early s. It was a decent story but they wrote Hawkeye to sound like a hillbilly.

4005933,0,t1_crcv3qt,Morrisons Batman run is all within the last ten years. Soule has nothing comparable to that so far. Edit I forgot this until a commenter below pointed this out but AllStar Superman probably the best thing that Morrison has ever written and easily one of the best Superman stories ever was written in the last decade. Soule certainly has nothing even close so far and likely never will.Edit  So in summation I guess my point is that Morrison has created two of the most memorable works in comics within the last ten years and Soule has Swamp Thing. Soule simply doesnt have a big enough body of work to claim that hes one of the greatest of the last decade. And it doesnt matter if Morrison is inconsistent because when he gets it right he gets it amazingly right. Look at Mary Shelley or Joesph Conrad. Theyre famous for writing one thing but those one things are so good that it doesnt matter whatever else they wrote.,comicbooks,crcwnp1,3,t5_2qhon

4009265,1,t1_crd9tbn,The original comment isnt really about a shared universe though. Look at it he says that a Feige is needed because DC gives too much creative control over the properties and that someone with extensive comicbook knowledge was needed to helm the universe. My response was that we do not need any more formulaic superhero movies which is what bringing in a Feige type would do as thats what he has done. Let DC try new things in their movies. Of course it remains to be see if having a shared universe will make each DC film like the last. And maybe its not fair to compare the old movies to the current MCU. But Id say Both Dark Knight films and Man of Steel are fair game and while two of the three arent very good the three are only similar in tone which again is more than I can say for any Marvel film.,comicbooks,crdac13,2,t5_2qhon

I mean he has a little bit of a point because anybody can become a mutant. There is no specific race nationality gender. So the only thing linking these people is the Xgene which manifests uniquely in each mutant.Sure mutants shouldnt be afraid to be mutants to accept that name and that culture. However as the universe is written you get new mutants who often completely lose their other heritage and culture when their Xgene activates. tldr Mutants shouldnt be ashamed to be mutants but they also shouldnt be forced to accept their mutation as their sole identity. ,comicbooks,cref7gd,1,t5_2qhon

4175449,0,t1_crw34l4,Keep in mind authorial intent or new criticism or reader response or any number of other ways to systematically approach a text are just lenses that the reader can employ to interpret that text. Part of critical theory is identifying the lenses one is using to critique a piece. This is partially how we are still talking about paintings or books created hundreds of years ago. While one may employ a New Historicist approach to understanding TDKSA like Grant somewhat does in this podcast another reader may provide a Marxist reading or a feminist reading or an authorial intent reading like Grant also somewhat does in this podcast  and thats ok! The multiplicity of readings produced by utilizing various critical lenses provides another layer for one to discuss and analyze in regards to a text.As a postscript you are probably most familiar with the New Criticism school of analysis. It is the most widely taught in schools today and relies on close readings of texts to construct a meaning. Historicizing this movement may lead you to this seminal critique of authorial intent.,comicbooks,crw7h9e,4,t5_2qhon

4232581,0,t3_39bo22,I really enjoyed this one. Tynion is not one of my favorite writers but hes been getting better with time. And he and Ming Doyle seem to make a good team on this book. It was a little text heavy but John is a bit of a talker so it fits the character. And Rossmos art gives it quite a unique feel. Honestly minor censorship aside it feels like a Vertigo book. I think DC may have realized that Hellblazer was as successful as it was because it pushed boundaries. The last Constantine series New  was apparently just mediocre from what I heard. I read the first issue because it was coplotted by Jeff Lemire but didnt really feel drawn into the story at all. This time around Im intrigued and I want to see where this goes. My hope for Constantine The Hellblazer is that it goes on for quite a while and maybe once again be one of the longrunning titles along with Batman and Superman. TLDR  This is a fun read and Im adding it to my pull list. ,comicbooks,cs2p8nf,8,t5_2qhon

He makes sense to sell items in celebrity gossip magazines and what not.The flaw I agree is that this isnt an appropriate ad for the context and customer base. Rather than take an ad campaign they already had for other venues and shoving it into this new medium they should have done more market research and come up with appropriate ads.

To keep some of the wonder theyve learned to appreciate at the theater. People arent as dumb as to have the movie told to them on a trailer no matter what Hollywood thinks. People are catching on this trailers spoil everything. Additionally this has spilled over to photo leaks rumors and all that good stuff online. Some people are starting to also avoid those stories and discussions.This movie has been spoiled and leaked guerrilla style harder than Ive ever seen. And some people either dont care about the movie and dont care about spoiling it or there are some that do care about the movie and dont mind or cant avoid spoiling some of it.So theres a big crowd watching these photos.

Particularly with regards to Moores belittling statements about Morrisons status in the comic book world the oftreferred to meal they had together in the early nineties in which Moore described Morrisob as an aspiring writer looking for advice about making it in comics when in fact Morrison had been releasing books for several years at that point...

If we think of humans as coming out of an assembly line the goal of which is propagation of the species with males and females that copulate to continue the assembly line then being gay or being a woman with a penis is a problem. It is a defect.Defect doesnt have to be a pejorative. Having an imperfection doesnt necessarilly make something bad some defects can even make things more valuable. For instance if we didnt have gay and trans people we would have a lesser understanding of what it means to be human and what is possible.

Its by Peter Milligan if it makes any difference. This review of the first couple of issues isnt the most flattering but then it also shits on Morrisons Animal Man and Doom Patrol so YMMV. The Robot collect this now piece seems more flattering but also more synoptic so read at your own spoilerrisk.Not technically set in ancient Egypt but Enki Bilals Nikopol trilogy  is a scifi set in alternatedystopian future Paris when the Egyptian Gods come calling. Id heartily recommend this from what Ive read sadly only the first of the three books  Gods in Chaos  I picked it up from a charity shop and now dont know whether to keep getting them as the individual books or go for the collected edition.If I had to recommend one of those Id pick the latter but the former fits your request better.If youre into retellings of the story of Moses as well I seem to remember coming across at least two of those and Id imagine youll have your pick of a large selection if thats what youre after.EDIT as I think of more Asterix popped over there in Asterix and Cleopatra Tintins adventures in Cigars of the Pharoah were set in more recent times but involved the mummies et al. and might scratch that itch if thats what you want.,comicbooks,csdxpvy,3,t5_2qhon

4359036,1,t1_csgrkde,gtWhy does Marvel hate Peter Parker so much? They dont. Think of what theyve done to Captain AmericaSteve Rogers as well. Marvel thinks the only way to remain relevant is to replace most of the white male characters with minorities and females instead of organically creating new characters to represent minorities the way characters like Falcon Black Panther and Luke Cage do. They seem to think the only way to make the statement that Marvel is progressive and postrace is by replacing our beloved characters that weve known for five decades or more.Im the target audience for Miles Morales a young Hispanic male who grew up loving SpiderMan. And I think replacing Peter Parker with Miles Morales is fucking stupid. I know the SJWs the Tumblr crowd etc they went nuts when it was announced SpiderMan would be allowed in the MCU and started raving for Miles Morales and making petitions and shit. So many sources are reporting thats why this happened the uproar to have a Black the Hispanic part seems to have fallen by the wayside based on who Tumblr wanted to be cast SpiderMan. Disney owns Marvel now. To them comics industry represents tens of thousands of sales a month at a couple dollars profit per unit while the movie industry represents BILLIONS of dollars in box office and merchandising. The comics side of Marvel is now seen as subordinate to the movie side clearly. So all this clamoring for Miles Morales to be the MCU SpiderMan may have been what drove the guys in charge at Marvel Comics to make him the new primary SpiderMan. Now Im not saying there shouldnt be minority superheroes or that Miles shouldnt exist. I thought it was really cool when I heard Ultimate SpiderMan was a Black Hispanic kid from Brooklyn had stopped following the series by this time. But to now make him the primary  SpiderMan to the point that it doesnt even seem Peter Parker will have his own title anymore... thats just ridiculous. It seems like pandering on Marvels behalf. Pandering to an audience that is really vocal but doesnt represent the majority. And I think beyond the novelty of the first few issues sales will reflect that.,comicbooks,csgzvwt,7,t5_2qhon

4512842,0,t1_cszh3ti,Well the first thing I thought of when I heard the news was how awesome it will be to hear Mark Hamill read The Killing Joke. No casting has been confirmed but I will be surprised if its anyone other than him and thats something Id get pretty excited for. Other than that I think its cooler seeing a cleaner version of these works with audio and voiced dialogue for the characters. I love the rough art in TDKR for example but the movie gave me a fluid and much cleaner looking version of that world which I did enjoy seeing. I will admit part of the enjoyment was because it just felt like rereading the book for the most partthere wasnt really much I experienced in watching that I hadnt when reading. But with these direct adaptations for DC its not a big risk at all if they stick to the source material like they did with TDKR so I understand why its happening. Plus it draws attention to the stories and unfortunately I personally havent found any of the more loosely based DCAU adaptations in recent years to be of great quality. Judging from how they approached TDKR Id like to assume DC will be very careful with this project so all in all Im ok with a good quality animated film being put out. Plus were already getting two Gods and Monsters seasons alongside the film and if this Killing Joke wasnt made it doesnt necessary mean that DC would pool resources to create more original animated content instead for that year or that they arent already working on more stuff.,comicbooks,cszhojv,10,t5_2qhon

4536396,1,t3_3d5z6l,This looks alright but I feel like people are bias because of it being the first trailer weve seen. Everyone is  riding on the high of the BvS trailer and thats making this look better.Besides Harley no one else really looks good here. Granted we only saw a minute or so of him but Will Smith didnt seem that great. He seemed sort of bored. I feel like people are just happy to finally see the new Joker but that scene just didnt work for me. Leto didnt seem right to me. The Im not gonna kill ya line was awesome but I didnt like his delivery. It seemed like hes trying to be Heath Ledgers Joker and not his own Joker.I hope it works and I like the trailer but I dont get the hype.

Many writers can cook up a pretty good story but Waid can really sell it with convincing dialogue more than most.That said I also really love the poeticism and clever wordsmithing of Alan Moore.

4603202,0,t1_ctat0mm,Alan Moore and DC had a falling out over Watchmen rights as rights were supposed to revert to Moore when it went out of print. Naturally DC has kept it in print for approximately forever now. Additionally DC was supposed to cut him in on merchandising but then claimed the merchandise was promotional material and therefore not subject to royalties. Moore never worked for DC  proper after that.Then he did work for Jim Lees WildStorm back when it was part of Image and Lee promised him his own imprint Americas Best Comics. In the process WildStorm became part of DC again but ABC hadnt yet launched. Moore reluctantly agreed to stick with WildStorm since the editorial influence from DC was supposed to be minimum. Then DC had a vintage advertisement for League of Extraordinary Gentlemen pulled from the book. The advertisement was for a genuine no joke this existed Marvel brand douche. Moore flipped his wig and left DC. Then there was a press release regarding V for Vendetta if I remember it correctly where some executive put words in Moores mouth and thats when he asked that he no longer be credited on movies relating to his comics leaving Lloyd and Gibbons to get full credit for the adaptations of V and Watchmen.TlDR DC keeps finding ways to piss off one of the more temperamental artists of our time.,comicbooks,ctatjz8,8,t5_2qhon

Most stories are about them fighting other Mutants or something trying to kill mutants. Often you dont see them going out on patrol like SpiderMan who often gets hate from the public still trying to halt and stop crime. So I could kind of see where it makes sense. Imagine if there were heroes in the world who work hard to save you and then there are Mutants who are generally only caring about themselves or their own politics because they arent well liked. They are perceived as only bringing trouble with them and not heroics. Doesnt work perfectly at all obviously but that is how Ive always rationalized it. ,comicbooks,ctdhrvf,3,t5_2qhon

4661528,0,t1_cthz3eu,This is a subject that interests me because I love TWD TV show and I like to wait until a finite series ends and then bingeread it all. So Ive read on the subject from time to time.Originally I remember him saying he wanted it to never end and that he could pass it on to someone else and hed love for it to someday go to  issues.More recently hes said that he knows the ending he knows the last page and that hes basically writing two stories now one that moves forward and one that starts at the ending and moves backward. When they meet thats when hell know how long its going to be. He also said that he isnt telling the TV show people his ending so if the show ends first it wont spoil his ending.In case youre wondering I eventually started to like the show less so I decided to read the comic.

4669801,0,t1_ctj5jx0,This is just my offthecuff definition.SJW is a pejorative for someone who is constantly offended by trivial things and wants them changed because they were offended. They frequently use newer social media to whip people who arent actually informed on the topic into a frenzy in an effort to be loud enough to force change.To be clear some things are offensive. And obviously its subjective whats offensive and whats not. But these are people who are so constantly sure that they or a group theyve chosen to represent are being oppressed or denigrated that you start to think they look for any chance to be outraged.Ive known people like since before we had social media. Hell I have family members who constantly think people are talking about them or not talking to them just right and try to get what they want by crying. This is sort of the social media version of that except its usually about misogyny or transphobia or racism or ablism or whatever and theyre able to amplify it thanks to new media.I think Id say a key part of the definition is that they try to bring others into their outrage and those others are happy to join. Theyll read a short blurb about whatever supposedly offensive occurrence and make up their mind that it was offensive without really looking into it and try to create enough outrage that the company involved loses business the person gets fired the book gets changed or what have you. A loud enough small group can have a big effect on the narrative and companies generally dont like controversy.,comicbooks,ctj6izb,16,t5_2qhon

4677289,0,t3_3exctu,I wrote this a while ago I copypaste it whenever people want some reading info on ol hornhead. DaredevilYoure fortunate as there have been some excellent DD runs many over the past decade. You could start with the Frank Miller run. Born Again is regarded as one of the quintessential DD story lines. Its got a great story and great art. You could also start with The Man Without Fear mini series also by Miller art by Romita Jr. which is a modern at the time retelling of Matt Murdocks origins. You could also start with Daredevil Yellow by Jeff Loeb which is also a good modern retake on the origin story. I would skip DD Season One however. I cant even remember the creative team behind it so that reaffirms to me that it isnt vital reading. Daredevil was relaunched in the late s under the Marvel Knights banner with a brand new . Kevin Smith started the volume off with an  issue run that is pretty good. Joe Quaseda does the art which is also rad. After that it leads into the Brian Michael Bendis run. This is my personal favorite DD run. Alex Maleev as well as some issues by David Mack is on art duties and the two work wonders together. This series has brilliant writing and brilliant art. I simply could not recommended this series enough. Ive talked it up to my friends that have no real interest in comics and especially not Daredevil as a character thank Fox for the film that left a bad taste in everyones mouth that ended Up loving it. In regards to the Bendis run I feel like you dont realize when youve fallen in love with it. You start reading it and it just sucks you in its tip top reading. Get on it!After Bendis comes Ed Brubaker. His run picks up right where Bendis leaves off. Brubaker takes the character in a new direction. Its more of an actionadventure type of book where as Bendis was more of a gritty crimemob style story. Both are great I just happen to like the former much more. The art for the Brubaker run is pretty solid too I jut cant recall who the artists are at the moment. The numbering goes back to the original numbering during this run mainly to commemorate the th issue of Dardevil. The numbering remains this way until the book was relaunched a few years later. Now here is where most fans will tell you the writing slips a little. Andy Diggle takes over after Brubaker and just like his predecessor he takes Matt in a new direction while also continuing on with story elements that were planted by Brubaker. Diggle tells a story that focuses on more of a magicspiritualmystical Asian inspired kind of book. Its pretty dark for the most part. A lot of people will tell you to skip this and while I do consider it to be VERY necessary reading I can agree to an extent because the writing wasnt great. At the very least you should read up on it on Wikipedia. It ties directly into Shadowland which was a crossover event that focused on the street level heroes Spidey Moonknight etc. with Daredevil as the primary antagonist. Thats right antagonist. Like I said I consider it to be vital reading. Once Shadowland ends the book turns into Black Panther The Man Without Fear. Without spoiling too much BP is taking care of Hells Kitchen for Matt for a little while. You dont need to read this but I quite enjoyed it myself. Its written by first name I cant remember Liss with someRotating artists. Theres only ish issues to read if this. There is a mini series also written by Diggle called Daredevil Reborn not to be confused with Millers Born Again. This series is only  issues and I found it to be the best of Diggles DD stories. It bridges the gap between Shadowland and the next volume. Next comes the Mark Waid run launching with a brand new  and new Volume. In general Mark Waids run has received nothing but critical acclaim. Like the writers before him Waid takes Matt on a new journey and new direction. This run is a little more upbeat and campy than any other Daredevil book Ive ever read. I can understand why some people might not like that kind of thing but I feel like Matt has faced so many hardships and so much tragedy in his life that he can certainly do with some more upbeat and happier moments. Theres still plenty of dark twists and turns in this run but in comparison to the others Especially Miller and Bendis this is like watching an episode of Sesame Street. The art is great too. There have been a few spectacular artists that have chipped I got this run Javier and Allred spring to mind right away but the standout is Chris Samnee. Waid and Samnee have made this book so enjoyable theyve got a fantastic control of the character. That run ends at issue  but is relaunched right away with ANOTHER new  and new Volume for All New Marvel Now. This run is sadly coming to and end soon. You could also check out Dardevil End of Days by Bendis and Maleev. It was great to see these two take ol Hornhead for a spin again. This book can be considered to be Daredevils The Dark Knight Returns. Its a future story that is meant to be canon. I liked it. It was dark and enjoyable. I hope you find this to be helpful.

4728141,0,t3_3fnlx8,I think its a combination of different factors and while thats one of them I wouldnt cite it as the only or main reason. Availability is probably the biggest factor in my eyes. Comics are only found at comic book stores. Getting comics in grocery stores gas stations by the checkout line along with other magazines would reel in kids from a young age and thats how you get another reader for life. Aside from that I think a big issue is that comics are just too overwhelming to begin reading. Every month theres some huge new event that a reader needs  books for to fully read understand. If a kid likes Batman and wants to read his comics theres usually two or three Batman titles at a time and maybe five more taking place within Gotham that often cross over. I know a lot of Image books have great creative teams telling awesome stories but this is  the reason I truly believe Image is having so much success right now the stories are contained. And as much as I hate to say it I think a focus on numbering is a problem too. It would be difficult to get used to and theres undoubtedly a charm linked to citing issues and their numbers but imagine if books didnt show the number on the cover or instead simply said Name of Arc  Part . Then on the inside cover the publisher listed the overall issue number in smaller print. That way a potential reader goes to a store and while a lot of books would be in the middle of an arc there would be some beginning a new storyline made obvious by the cover. Believe it or not there are people who go into a store and think they cant read titles like Superman or Detective Comics because they havent read the  issues before. Its just a ton of contributing factors really some bigger than others.,comicbooks,ctqitrx,2,t5_2qhon

All New XMen  Im a sucker for teen team books I think Bagely excels in that area and enjoyed Hopelesss take on teen characters in his teen Avengers books. New Avengers  sold on the cast and the concept. Ive been impressed by what Ive read of Ewings books so this one might be a lock if I dont chose the Ultimates instead.

4790006,0,t1_ctxzatq,gtI dont think you have a particularly wellinformed idea of statistical theory if you think you need similar base population sizes to draw any notable conclusions. You only need the population to reach a minimum threshold where you can take a sample of sufficient size. Statisticians are a lot better and more effective at their jobs than you seem to think.But studying relatively small populations do not always have results that are relevant to larger populations. For example say you have a small town  people. Then say you have a large city  million people. Now if you did a study on the small town measuring things like community involvement dont you agree that these results arent likely to apply to the big city? Methods that work fine with small populations in close contact with each others do not apply to large populations of millions. The same is true with a lot of sociological issues. I think statistics scale up just fine when talking about some topics like perhaps medical issues or general political leanings perhaps but I think they are a particularly bad fit for sociological studies where there are numerous differences between the smaller and larger groups that are impossible to factor out of the results. If statistics could be applied universally to every situation there would be a lot less problems in this world because the solutions would be easy to test and apply. gtI would have changed my mind. I really would. Now I will admit after seeing your position I did not hold out much hope for such an occurrence simply because I am intimately familiar with the position youve adopted. If you had provided any new information I would have taken it into account. But all you provided were standard rationalizations that just dont gel with the hard data. Your points were wellthought out and did have internal logical consistency. But if theyre contradicted by the numbers which I am familiar with which I know the methodology behind. I cant in good conscience change my mind when every shred of evidence I have ever been able to find supports my current position and disproves yours.Ditto. ,comicbooks,ctybi5m,0,t5_2qhon

I think people claiming that stuff is sexist is less of an issue than actual sexism because the people that decried the sexism are usually ignored by the industry. It seems that the general population of reddit believes that SJWs and feminism has a bigger impact on society than it probably does in the real world. Im not really even sure about people that complain about sexism because the products still continue to go on like they would have if someone didnt complain about it. I dont claim to really know but I know sexist shit when I run across it but in general it seems to have gone down in the current years. We have a lot of great female superheroes that have been well represented and not overly sexualized. It seems to be less of an issue in America I think. Japan is another story. I dont know. Im just rambling. But one thing I know for certain is that people complaining about sexism is not as much of an issue as actual sexism. I mean that from an objective standpoint. Someone complaining is not as harmful as someone effectively hurting someones identity. Now the question is how much actual sexism exists in comic books? I dont know. But both sides can get pretty annoying. The side of you damn feminists get so angry at everything and this offends me therefore its sexist. ,comicbooks,cu6xfqz,4,t5_2qhon

I dont think there is any other superhero comic series that takes its internal logic and forward progression of the characters and plot that seriously.Im also going to give a plug to Terry Pratchett and his Discworld novels he would set up a joke in the first chapter of a book only to have the punchline come in the very last chapter and still have you roll out of bed laughing.,comicbooks,cub1w1a,8,t5_2qhon

Hes the guy responsible for taking Batman back to his roots along with Neal Adams and one of the best comic writers of his generation. His editorial work is also massive with character defining runs in Iron Man Demon in a Bottle Daredevil Born Again and Batman too many to count. Although in Batmans case I feel like he did as much good as harm since he had a very specific and restrictive take on the character that kept him from being used in other books without his strict editorial oversight.,comicbooks,cubuog4,1,t5_2qhon

DC is far too confusing lately with all of its Theres only  universe now....wait theres .....wait.....theres actually the same number of multiverses again heres why and heres why theres gonna be  again even though we dont really care anymore where as Marvel always felt very simple to me. There was Ultimate original  and a few What Ifalternate history future spinoffs like Marvel Zombies and Age of Apocalypse that could easily with the exception of AoA be ignored for whichever universe you want to follow. Bringing in all of the universes for one big hurrah at Marvel reeks a bit of what DC did with Infinite Crisis.....but I liked Infinite Crisis so Im ok with it. ,comicbooks,cuc5db8,4,t5_2qhon

I just read Civil War yesterday and enjoyed it.But now wanting to get into say Thor Cap Iron Man and Hulk I find out they are all different.

She doesnt name the offending party but Scott Lobdell working then and now for DC later outs himself.Heres G. Willow Wilson saying that Some of the most popular creators had semiironic harems in the late s and early s which were sort of casting couches.Tess Fowler didnt reveal Brian Woods name until others came to her with similar stories. He was still doing XMen at Marvel after the whole thing came out.Mariah Huehner talks about being groped by a name creator which another creator then tells her hes known for doing so. Shes worked editorial at both Vertigo and IDW.And heres Nick Hanover describing a similar sentiment in light of the Edmondson thing with Newsarama editor Chris Arrant aka uchrisarrant chiming in in the comments that hes either had people refusing to go on record or only second and thirdhand reports. ,comicbooks,cuwu53h,1,t5_2qhon

Just taking the . credits two courses that I need to graduate Canadian history because I dont think I know enough about this country for a guy who insists on living here and intro to calc because I need to prove to myself that I can do it. After the first couple lectures I realized how much Ive missed math these past four years.Notable literature includes two volumes of Stephanie Brown Batgirl which I adored note the flair change. Continuing to plod my way through New  Aquaman and Justice League including a detour into the Trinity War collection. Lots of other reading done but nothing else that really sticks out. Picked up Superman For All Seasons but havent had a chance to open it yet.Reddit once again proves incontrovertibly that it has no tasteGot drinks with pole dance girl. Kind of out of the blue talked about what seemed like all the sad things that have ever happened to her. Lot of shit going on in her life lot of ghosts shes still dealing with.

Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps  of   I havent read past the first issue but I like the story. I think it was the first Secret Wars tiein that gave me necessary perspective on Battleworld. Deadpool vs. Thanos  of   Just for collectings sake. Im not super into Deadpool or anything.  S.H.I.E.L.D. th Anniversary Fury  of   A oneshot is a oneshot. Ive been collecting the other issues.  Inhumans Attilan Rising  of   More and more Secret Wars titles finishing up. Its bitter sweet.  Kanan   Ive really enjoyed this title. Looks like a oneoff issue going back to the Rebels timeframe probably to kickoff the next story arc.  Runaways  of   Havent read  yet Ill get to it eventually.  Weirdworld  of   Wait for it... Im behind. But I love this title. Will certainly be pulling the ongoing series after Secret Wars.  XTinction Agenda  of   For the XPeople.  Years of Future Past  of   For the XPeople. Paybacks   I missed this last week. Want to see if its any good. Its not like I need more pulls so if its not great I might just finish the arc and call it a day. Also Secret Wars  is unconfirmed right? Im pretty sure its still delayed. But on the extreme off chance its not I will also be getting that. ,comicbooks,cva3amj,6,t5_2qhon
5179245,1,t3_3lxy6t,I think its really hard to look at the numbers and see that men and white people are holding over  of the jobs and honestly think theyre taking jobs away from white guys!Im fine with companies giving people who would normally be ignored or cast aside a leg up in the industry. I think having storytellers with different experiences and different backgrounds and different upbringings makes for more and more interesting stories. DC and Marvel and Image and everybody else should be trying to appeal to as many different people as possible. Its just good business.And its not like theyre just hiring people off the street. Theyre obviously trying to find talented people. Theyre giving people who would in some circumstances be ignored or turned away a leg up in an industry that hard to break into.And I just really like diversity in storytelling. I dont care if you dont like Deadpool or Squirrel Girl or Batgirl or Harley Quinn because lots of other people do and I can easily see why. I love the idea of a Pacific Islander Aquaman because it makes more sense to me than a rando from Maine. I love that her religion and her heritage are a big part of Kamala Khans character because it makes her stories and her relationships with her family different from everybody else. And for every Wally West and Lady Thor and other legacy or change or new character that wasnt introduced or handled well there are tons that are. Its cool seeing a wave of new characters being introduced. Its great getting things like Prez and The Omega Men and Ms. Marvel and Midnighter and Constantine and seeing how different they are from each other and how they appeal to different groups of people and how theres just so many fucking options.,comicbooks,cvaaent,7,t5_2qhon

5198053,0,t1_cvcjuzs,Its the difference between buying based on what you want to read and buying based on what completes your collection on the display shelf. I will admit theres an entire demographic that treats comics in the same manner they treat hot wheels and action figures.Im just not convinced that the number of folks who buy comics they dont like and also are engaged in serious discussion of comics as art and narrative is nearly as large as some are trying to claim here. Its likely a small minority of the readership that does this and mostly the folks who are so detached from reading with a critical eye towards quality that they collect their comics based on the name of the character on the cover rather than the creative team behind the work. I imagine these folks are mostly younger readers or those who collect mainly for the collecting and nostalgia aspects of the hobby... and thus the quality of the work is of secondary concern to the collecting itself leading to complaints about the series they are collecting not being particularly good.,comicbooks,cvck4eq,1,t5_2qhon

He is technically invulnerable to most kinds of harm except getting suckerpunched by the likes of Darkseid and Mongul but still gets knocked around by big enough explosions and lasers. Made him able to be threatened on a weekly basis without resorting to kryptonite.But they also dont shrink from showing that he is a god among men and all the trouble and heroics that comes from that. I hate Superman stories where he is portrayed as an outsider because of his power or how emo he is at not being human... Dude hes Superman! If he didnt take a bit of joy in wearing a cape and waving to people why the hell is he doing it?I also love the humdrum way they handle it eventually. Lois Lane is on a plane that gets hijacked everyone freaks out screaming crying and shes just sitting there reading a book. The hijackers are like wtf lady...

5354770,0,t3_3oct0r,Invincible Iron Man   I think Ill probably echo the sentiment that Ive seen about this book in that it really surprised me about how good it is especially because of all the bitching about Bendis in the past year. However I know that until the last issue of Ultimate SpiderMan people were loving that series and I think this what really helps Iron Man. Marquez and Bendis work really well together they know each others rhythms. Look at the  page spread in the workshop the art is great and Bendis doesnt overload the small panels with narration boxes letting the art breathe. Same goes for the Thor gag Marquez is able to clearly convey Tonys face when in the background and Bendis doesnt overload the panel with dialogue that has the same effect as the expression. Bendis dialogue fits with Tony he feels like the Stark that Fraction was writing and the writing feels refined as if Bendis has gone over it multiple times and ensured it works in the book. If Marvels flagship book is going to carry on in this way Im in for the long haulNOTE The spoiler people are talking about for Secret Wars is really a non issueDoctor Strange   Also a really good looking book Bachalos art took a little adjusting to fully understand but its vibrant and clear minus a couple of confusing pages at the start. The scene on the street where the colours gone from the background and surrounding looks amazing so props to Townsend for the colours that he used to make the focus of that scene pop. The issue itself feels very reminiscent of Thor GOTs opening arc and that not necessarily a bad thing considering that its considered one of the best Thor stories ever written and Im hoping that Aaron is aware of this and is going to go in a different direction that I dont expect. Also because of that first page I want an omnibus this time next year of the Silver Age Strange stuff.Batman and Robin Eternal   This has got for the ride as well. I didnt read Batman Eternal as it was coming out because that was quite a lot to drop each month and  issues was a big commitment. On the other hand it seems like the Bat office and creators have listened to criticisms of the first  issue series.  issues hopefully means that this will be a tight focused story and if this issue is anything to go by thatll be true. Theres Dicks plot at the centre Grayson has more of Dicks plot though if thats what youre into and the other threads that seem to arise flow naturally theres no awkward transition to a completely different unrelated character to set up their arc everyone seems to come and go as necessary. Daniels art looks pretty good throughout. Some of the movement in the book like Dick at the Tower of Enlightenment feels like Millers Daredevil. That last page has got me curious though.Secret Wars   Again a lot of pieces are moved around the board but without an action scene really. This isnt really an issue for me Ive kind of accepted this is how the middle portion of Secret Wars will be and Im expecting the final third to be more dynamic and energetic. Still fun pairings of characters and Ribics art with Svorcinas colours look great if the delays mean we get this team I dont really have an issue. Star Wars   Not too much to say about this from me. Immonens art looks great as usual hoping hes back after Vader Down Chewbacca is a great character to see away from Han but not too much happens this issue. I also have Lando  but my store got shorted on Lando  so I need to find that first before I can read the last issue. If it carries on how it has for the first three issues though itll be the best of the Star Wars books.Finally Paper Girls . Im going to be honest with you I dont really like Saga. I mean I love Staples art and the first six issues were great but the next twelve didnt do enough for me. I think part of that was the fact that I was hyped up for what many consider the greatest thing on the stands at the moment. This was an impulse buy in a sense I worked out what I wanted on my Pull List and put this on there because of who was working on the book. Chiang and Wilsons work on Wonder Woman is some of the best of the New  and Vaughn is by no means a bad writer in my eyes Saga is very good I just need larger chunks to digest. I did like this issue a lot the spread of Erin riding her bike looked gorgeous and after Runaways we know how well Vaughn works with teenage characters. Each one feels unique all ready and I cant wait to see where the story goes. I dont think Ive seen any previews or promotional materials so that last page reveal which makes so much sense based on the beginning of the book really sidelined me. To anyone on the fence give it a go just incase this is me doing the same thing that people reading Saga did for me.NEXT WEEK Im at uni so I cant pick up my single issues for  weeks instead Ill probably have time to write about Buffy Season  and maybe Superior SpiderMan.,comicbooks,cvw4rxw,3,t5_2qhon

What he didnt really care about was the tone of the book. And I mean that in terms of the soap operaticensemblepersonal stories that defined the book from Claremont through the s. He expanded on the idea of what the XMen could be at the expense of longtime readers of the book. It wasnt necessarily about one team but obviously he had his core team but rather the mutant race as a whole. It wasnt about them being superheroes anymore.Obviously I really liked it but I can totally see why longterm XFans would hate it. I do think the focus on the school was his greatest contribution and Im glad that stuck around.And I also like Claremont and Whedons run which are totally s from Morrisons. Not sure what my point is with that but I do think the XMen are a great concept at their core and Im glad Morrison got to experiment with them since most XMen stories just follow the same formula.,comicbooks,cwgt3vj,8,t5_2qhon

5676810,0,t3_3srzdb,I am reading way too god damn many manga. To name a few  Kiss My Ass  Its about a guy with hemorrhoids. Thats it. No special powers. No burning courage of a shounen hero. Just a dude with roids and his female friend who also has roids. I have no idea why I read it probably novelty of it all. Well that and it was just one volume so we.Ive also been reading Boku no Hero Academia which is a fantastic super hero manga and is going to be made into an anime soon which is fantastic as well. Im hoping it doesnt succumb to the type of shit that Naruto did where all the side characters are eventually rendered completely unimportant as the main character runs over every threat. Not holding my breath there though.Actually finished reading Akira here recently great manga made me appreciate the movie that much more.Another Im enjoying is Inu Yashiki. Old worthless dude becomes a robot also a teenager does. Made by the guy who made Gantz its got good characterization.,comicbooks,cx0riq5,1,t5_2qhon

5689401,0,t3_3syvyu,Pretty new to comics overall the past year the only comics Ive been reading are Fuse and Star Wars. Got a job after finishing school now so starting to ramp up my comic activity as I can finally afford it. Below is what Ive been reading the past  weeks.Preacher Volume Blew me away cant say enough about this. I was hooked from the get go and ended up reading the entire volume in  sittings. Everything from the crazy story beautiful artwork and fun characters just had me entranced. Dont want to rush through it so will take my time getting the other volumes but in the mean time will try to get into some more Ennis comics giving Punisher Max a chance first Lazarus Volumes Loved loved loved this. Read volumes  and  in one sitting I got so hooked. The world building is incredible the idea of every family basically having their own terminators is such a good draw how cool was all of them meeting and Im really invested in Forevers character arc. Im really excited to get Volume  and then be able to start getting the floppies monthly. Also love the art work just some beautiful pages throughout. Klaus What a fun idea and really great first issue. Digging the art style and setting enjoyed the goofiness of the end seeing all the toys he made. Gonna be a enjoyable  issues I think.Big fan cool art and nice mature Bond story. Going to enjoy this one going forward subscribed to the series.Ultimates This was pretty good will be buying the second issue to see if it keeps me going. Like the art style and the more scifi kind of setting. Chewbacca ampNice light hearted little series. Im subscribed to it and will be finishing it out not earth shattering but cool art work and a fun little story. Nice compliment to some of the other Star Wars comics Im reading.All New Avengers Didnt really like this at all. Not really invested in the Marvel comic universe as a whole so I got this more to try it out than anything. Dont think Ill be getting issue .Illuminati  Wasnt crazy about this one either. Art style isnt my bag and the storysetup was kind of meh. However Im a sucker for heist type stuff and it seems like theyre setting that up so Ill probably get the second issue to see if its something Ill stick out with. I think my overall ambivalence towards the Marvel comic universe hurst me with a series like this because I dont have any investment in the characters or know who a lot of them even are.,comicbooks,cx2bq6y,2,t5_2qhon

The binds are around  per book and you can go up to . thick per book.  That is the base price that included a solid color hardcover in a color of your choosing amp text on the spine of the book the rest is extra and will raise the price. If youre OK with the ads staying in you can send in the books asis theyll remove the staples for you.  You HAVE to put them in the correct order though doubletriple check this before you send them off There is a page binding slip that you can print out from their website that lets you write in all the optionstext that you want. Youll print out one for each book you want bound. I usually take two comic backing boards and put them in the front and the back of each volume Im sending off put the binding slip on top of the front cover and tie it off with twine to make sure it all stays in order. Take it to a UPS store or KinkosFedEx store. Theyll be able to pack it all up a lot better than you can. Just ship it through them the cheapest way possible usually is ground takes about a week It takes about  weeks for them to finish once they receive the comics  weeks for a rush order  and extra  per volume Theyll invoice you by email you pay for the order and then they send the books back to you by media mail.If any of this sounds confusing just call the company.

6064457,0,t3_3yeb6v,Late to the party here but in Peter Davids XFactor there was an interesting idea proposed by the main villain Damian Tryp  that Madrox having had his mutant powers since birth wasnt actually a mutant but was another version of Homo superior a killcrop. These were an earlier form of mutation that since they had their powers at birth were found more easily and thus eradicated more completely from the gene pool. Since mutants usually gained their ability around puberty they were better able to hide them for the most part. It was an interesting addition to mutant lore but this was around the time that Marvel started distancing itself from new mutant stuff and it was quickly forgotten. Also from the moment of her introduction it was always hinted that Jubilees powers would eventually get... good. But that never happened and then she got depowered on MDay.

You said dinnerI then asked if we truly couldnt have a dinner scene without disrupting the story If youll recall that was your original claim. That forcing a reminder in would disrupt the story. This is the claim I argued to be creating a false dichotomy between a good story and a story where Cindis heritage has already come up.And you said He could have Again lets walk that back down the conversation.

Michael Dooney helped out with the comic a bit after Eastman amp Laird stopped working on it. Im pretty sure that is his signature. linkOP do you remember getting these signed at the same place?

6202701,0,t3_408wvd,Takio by Brian Michael Bendis is really fun. Its a pretty basic story about a pair of children who get superpowers but the sibling relationship is really spot on and the art lends the story a unique feel.Danger Club is really great. The premise is that all the big name superheroes of the setting went off to fight some worldending threat and never came back. Now its up to all the sidekicks to save the day while unraveling the mystery of what happened to all their mentors. It takes the immersion approach thrusting you right into the thick of the setting and letting you learn as you go along. Gets you caught up in the energy and momentum of the story so that even when you dont fully understand whats going you still keep turning those pages. Its a darker take on the superhero genre but I dont feel like its cynical?

6344932,0,t1_czaa32n,The absurdity of the line the panel the gesture and everything else about it is the ridicule just by virtue of the exaggeration of the whole thing.If I want to satirize a politician who is taking money from lobbyists and draw a political cartoon of him with dollar bills stuffed into his pockets overflowing in an exaggerated way I do not need to then draw a person next to him pointing it out and making fun of it. Its still a satirical take on an issue which uses the viewers previously held knowledge to inform them that the image is meant to be satirical.In the case of Ultimate Captain America the satire is doubly effective because of the added irony of the readers who do share that opinion and dont see it as being a ridiculous one.Its essentially Poes Law as applied to comic book readers who dont understand politics on a scale with any more complexity than what they see in comics.And then there are those who know that the opinion is outrageous and one to be ridiculed but because there are so many people who theyve heard echoing that opinion they assume the writer meant it without irony or satire and then whine about it on the Internet.Just a heads up youre in that last category.,comicbooks,czauk0x,1,t5_2qhon

6359218,0,t3_42ptdz,Big week this week.  Mostly Image books.   Black Magick   I checked this out because it was the Pull of the Week here and I wasnt disappointed.  The artwork is amazing and Rucka story is engrossing.   Chew   Chew is one of the few books that I stayed uptodate with even when I wasnt reading a lot.  Its just such a bonkers book.   Ringside   As both a comic book fan and a wrestling fan this book appeals to me.  It has a real pulpy feel to it which I think serves it well.   Saga   The other book along with Chew that Ive followed for a couple of years.  I think this is still the best written and best illustrated comic on the market today.   Southern Bastards   This is a book that appeals to me on a personal level because I grew up in a small town that was crazy about high school football.  I was disappointed that this got delayed but hopefully the wait is worth it.   Superman   I have been trying to catch up on the Superman books but the continuity especially in the early going is all over the place.  I just wrapped up the Truth storyline which is interesting to see if there are any long term ramifications and Ill be starting Savage Dawn here shortly.   ,comicbooks,czch0e8,4,t5_2qhon

Mainly because it quite obviously is you and the writers of that article really are jumping through hoops to be offended. I mean the author concedes that the panel in the comic was hilarious and then goes on to attribute that panel as a quote. What?!I am still waiting for you to back up your claim that Powell called anyone a rapist if he has removed a video where he claimed that then that is what is called a retraction. The only evidence to back up any claim is the panel from The Goon in which the only person he is making fun of is himself.

I havent read Millers run as art from that era is kind of a turn off for me but its commonly agreed that his run is part of the better part of his career.There is a chronological order to the runs and they do carry on from each other with the exception of Soules recent series which does seem to erase a lot of what Waid introduced to the series.There is also Kevin Smiths run of Daredevil which is... in my opinion pretty eh.,comicbooks,czqrsod,2,t5_2qhon

She can also use her swords to shatter telepathic powerinhibitors imposed on others. Psylockes telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world. Thus she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness.

6552232,0,t3_45cgxq,Great film. The jokes were funny and on point. Had the right amount of Deadpools darker aspects without overdoing it I hope they expand this in future films the torture scene and the building burning down was dark and it fit perfectly with the character couldve used a bit more of that. The characters were interesting. I wouldve liked to know more about the villains motivation and past which was talked about but barely touched on but I guess the point is that its not super important so why bother. The villains name being Ajax was a cool reference to the Greek myth of the strongest soldier in the Greek army in the Trojan war. The dish soap line was perfect. I wouldve liked more of Deadpools less sane side as well. In the comics he has voices in his head and in the movie I felt like maybe they were referencing that inuniverse with the way he kept addressing the audience. In one scene Colossus asks him something like who are you talking to? and Deadpool says them or the audience or something which I guess could allude to everyone inuniverse thinking hes insane and that he hears voices. Which if thats the case is pretty clever. After credits scene was funny but IMO skippable. It didnt tell me anything I didnt already know from articles Id read online. Wouldve liked for at least one Wolverine cameo. Colossus was great but I thought it was out of character that he vomit from watching someone being shot in the head. ,comicbooks,czx1z8t,1,t5_2qhon

Obviously I dont empathize  with what he goes through like I dont know what its like living in NY or working as a photographer for a demanding boss. But certainly enough that it makes him more relatable than someone like Tony Stark who was born with a silver spoon up his ass or Steve Rogers a living war hero.I feel like youre trying to be culturally sensitive by insisting that Peter only represents the American everyman but youd be surprised at the common themes of life that people around the world face.

Hoping to see Harper and Dicks story come to a good end here. Grayson   With the revealed changes on the way I suddenly believe in the stakes of this story way more than I did before. HeMan the Eternity War   with the way  ended I imagine most of this is simple denouement. Great end to an incredible run by Abnett. I wonder if HeMan gets another ongoing when this is done? Justice League   This is the main attraction this week. This story has been better than sex in the last few months. Justice league    I dont recall seeing this title on the rebirth docket so all the exciting changes theyve been building to are going to basically be for nothing. Lets see if they can take this to a satisfying ending. Superman  and SupermanWonder Woman   I have been loving savage Dawn so its great to see that were getting two installments at once here. Teen Titans   I love Pak so if anyone can turn this team around its him. We Are Robin   I have enjoyed this story but its been going WAY too slow and I feel like a lot of its momentum is getting murdered by the return of Bruce and Damian to Gotham so this comic may not be long for this world. Superman The Coming Of The Supermen   Worth it for Neal Adams drawing superman a ton alone.ImageSpawn   this has been a consistently great title since  highly recommended for lapsed Spawn readers.Saga  Lets see if this week we can actually visit some of the main characters again.

6789235,0,t1_d0ld9gm,Man I dunno. I cant help but feel that this push for representation is just...misguided. Full disclosure I am a White Male so if you think that automatically makes my opinion worthless feel free to downvote and move on but I am also bisexual have Asbergers Syndrome and am culturally Catholic and live in a part of Northern Ireland which is  Protestant and Straight so I do actually have a little experience in what it is like to be a minority even if such things arent typically thought of in the USA as being minority things.When I was growing up I didnt really feel any strong need to be represented. I didnt crave or even particularly care about being represented in media. When I looked at Daredevil I didnt see a catholic hero who represented me I saw a cool dude who had radar vision and beat up bad guys with sticks. I more identified with the people who seemed closer to me personally like Peter Parker or New XMen era Cyclops. I identified with these characters even if they didnt represent my minority status more than others who did because the things that were most immediately important to me was not my religion but it was the fact that girls didnt like me at school that I didnt have many friends that I was bullied that I suffered from anxiety etc. That was the stuff that really drew me to these characters. But the important thing is that still I didnt feel the need to be represented by these characters. They were just characters I liked and empathized with.  Even nowadays I really dont give a shit about a characters sexuality. When a character comes out as nonstraight I dont give a shit because I dont have a need for characters to represent me. Id rather just let a writer write what they think makes for a good story they want to tell than demand that more things have to have catholic autistic bi guys. Trying to force in representation where it isnt natural doesnt really help anyone. I think we can all agree that Ms.Marvel is bloody brilliant at least in part because of the fact that shes a Muslim is not the central part of her character it informs her character and is definitely a part of it but its not the main thing. She has more to it than that. Meanwhile FemThor for the length of her original series had one single character attribute woman. Now this was mostly because they had a stupid mystery about who she was and therefore couldnt give too much of her personality away that might show who she actually was. But most of her dialogue was just horribly generic devoid of any character the only thing approaching a character she had was the gimmick where her internal thoughts spoke modern like and her outward speech was asgardian style and could just as easily be spoken by any of the cookie cutter Strong Female Characters weve got running around these days. To be honest Im not that interested in a characters race or gender or sexuality unless it informs an aspect of the characters personality. If your personality is based solely on those things youre probably actually a really boring spod. Characters are so much more than the labels they are attached to and so much more than token characters to appeal to and represent a group. And thats what this current push is creating for the most part token characters. I mean for fucks sake this article is advocating that because this character is about eastern mythology and martial arts he SHOULD be asian. Isnt that problematic in and of itself?Real diversity that actually means something is only going to come about through increasing diversity in creators. Writers invariably write from their own experiences and their own beliefs and were only going to see more interesting things when more interesting creators come aboard If you think there arent enough stories out there with characters that represent you then go out and create something that does. Complaining that the current crop of material doesnt pander to you is just obnoxious. Instead of doing something deconstructive why dont you do something constructive instead?,comicbooks,d0lujd8,23,t5_2qhon

TChaka might have been one of Buckys targets from before and the explosion I mentioned could have been about that. The vibranium from Wakanda that was involved in the Ultron attacks could force a normally isolationist country into the world. TChalla on the agenda that he needs to show support to another world superpower and to hunt down his fathers killer joins Iron Mans side.

Jason is the victim in every way the system can fail you. Batman envisions a city where people dont have to be afraid of walking down an alleyway or being attacked. Jason accepts that in order to achieve that dream one must do things that may not be acceptable. Such as taking over the drug trade and limiting its exposure to consenting adults and never children. Mad men like the joker should be killed before they have a chance to hurt anyone. Guns and killing can be used for the greater good.

Unless your argument is that the artist is deliberately trying to misrepresent a situation that she herself created there is no reason to doubt what the woman is saying is true. Perhaps theres a fault with the situation not being expressed as clearly as it possibly could have been in the panels but honestly the great majority of people in this thread understood just fine. ,comicbooks,d1jcnxb,3,t5_2qhon

7089023,0,t1_d1juw5m,I disgree with points youve made and wholeheartedly agree with others.Sounds like our expectations differed coming into this movie. I sort of knew what I was getting and didnt expect anything perfect just based on the source material being used and the tone of Man of Steel. For the ideal Superman I read my favorite Superman writers Waid or Morrison in that order. For the ideal Batman I read my favorite Batman writers I still loved Morrisons Batman. Scott Snyder edges him out based on narrative depth and promoting the detective that is Batman. I also enjoy some Tony Daniel though his art outweighs his writing ability.I didnt expect completely fleshed out characters from this movie because its just shy of  hours and I knew they were addressing both main characters in the story from the middle of their respective story lines. We dont see the  months of development from Superman. We dont see the  years of Development from Batman.Even as a hardcore DC fan am I so bound by absolute reverence to the source material that I cant appreciate a modern darker interpretation? Thats like saying anything Frank Miller did in his interpretation is blasphemy which it was at the time. And  years later we appreciate it as a classic. Batman doesnt snap necks and paralyze people. Batman doesnt cripple criminals. But hey it happens in that story.I felt that this movie was creative in terms of representing two heroes we are familiar with at their utmost potential but still havent found their way or have somehow lost their way. Just like we all do. Were not going to be our  best of who we are all of the time. and gt Having him say Shit is just another way for Zack Snyder to make himself feel like hes making a movie for grownups.This was an improv line on behalf of Ben Affleck. He recently admitted this in an interview and felt it humanized the character in a very real Im going to fucking die situation. This line had nothing to do with Snyder. The Son of a Bitch line also had nothing to do with Snyder. That was Terrio and Affleck.I felt the character development was consistent. If youre looking for  years of experience to be fleshed out for Batman or the  months fleshed out for Superman in entirety thats a bit unfair and slightly naive. A character can go through major changes during the course of a film but fulling fleshing out a character isnt a requirement for a good film. Drive with Ryan Gosling for example. How about Inception or Interstellar? Some of the best characters in different movies are never entirely developed or fleshed out. They end up as they are who they are and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. Theres also cases like B v. S where the story takes place at a certain point in the characters lives where They are who they are right now. and by the end of the film They are leaning toward one direction or another or entirely staying the same. Very few films complete everything or answer every question. VERY few. Its not fair to expect that when the majority of films product dont do that either.I feel like youre a purist and I respect that. But a realistic Batman may NOT get better the longer he does it. Nolans didnt and that was THE MOST realistic Batman on screen to date. Expecting him to be just like the comics where hes been mid s for decades never have any consistent injuries or lingering emotionalmental trauma aside from the repeated MY PARENTS DIED AND I DREAM ABOUT IT bit that would affect his work and his ability to continue being Batman the same way is like saying being a Cop for years in a heavy crime area doesnt change you from Rookie to Retirement. Or being ANYTHING doesnt change you from rookie to retirement. Youre being unrealistic. If you want an unrealistic completely comic book accurate Batman watch the animated movies for that. Kevin Conroy is the best Batman of all.gtAnd you know what? I dont think people went into this movie wanting to see Guy who used to be Batman vs Guy who will grow into being Superman. I think we all wanted to see Batman v Superman.I saw Batman vs. Superman. I saw versions of the characters that were products of the world around them. Products of what theyve had to deal with good and bad. I dont think youve got any right to speak for me or anyone else when it comes to I dont think people went into this movie wanting.. or I think we all wanted.. You cant speak for everyone. You can say I didnt go into this movie wanting to see.. and I wanted to see.. Thats my main gripe. Your opinion is not be all end all and there are just many diehard DC Comics fans that have hated this movie as there are that really liked or even loved it. And of course weve got die hards right in the middle on it. I lean toward really like with different aspects but Im in the middle on other aspects because I also expected more here and there.You can come up with  different scenarios that Superman could have stopped Zod in that situation but when youre wrestling with a bornandbred soldier with your same level of power struggling just to hold him in place lock his arms up and then try to control his head as hes blasting heat vision at helpless people I think any human being is going to make a quick brash decision. I still stand by the neck snap. It wasnt calculated. It was panicked. It was human. I dont think Superman is running through all of the nonviolent scenarios after this guy starts targeting people Superman screams for him to stop and Zod simply replies Never. Never is Never. Its him or earth. Make your next move count.Anyway we can go back and forth and we both have valid points. But this isnt a debate that can be won or settled. We have different expectations points of view and flexibility with the portrayal of these legendary characters.Again you made some great points. I dont entirely agree with them but holding true to the comics they hold weight for me.,comicbooks,d1jwqdj,1,t5_2qhon

7091293,0,t1_d1k5hol,ShazamCaptain Marvel is a bit tough because hes also been around since . His publication history is a bit complicated. DC sued the original publisher Fawcett for ripping off Superman. Publication ceased and the character laid dormant for years. Marvel then published a comic called Captain Marvel about a different character which is why DC could never print the name Captain Marvel on any comic covers. Then they later acquired him in the s. The classic comics are a lot more lighthearted cartoony and filled with intriguing and entertaining moon logic than the way the character is presented in Injustice.If youre only interested in the current version  Shazam! Vol.  is your best bet. If you just like the character and want to see more Jeff Smiths Shazam Monster Society of Evil is a good choice. Its a standalone miniseries that is invoking the tone and style of the original comics. I personally have an affinity for the s series Power of Shazam! its one of the most effective marriages of classic fun and cartoony comics with more modern soap opera style ongoing superhero shenanigans. Neither of these are relevant to the current take though if thats a dealbreaker.I havent played or read Injustice so again help me out by naming the other magic users.

I can see that Zack is trying to make Clark a three dimensional character and also examine how everyday people view him but his problem is that he overdoes it to the point of forgetting about what makes Superman Superman.

So Id make roughly . off of every . issue of Batman.. The minimum Diamond ordering numbers are based on stores which primarily sell other things but wish to stock some comics toys or other merchandise. No store can survive solely off of  of orders a month. . Margins in TPBs are similar to those for single comics.. You do need to plan your orders in advance. That being said you can place orders for backstock comics which have already been released which Diamond still has in inventory and those would arrive within two weeks.

People always point at DC as the major perpetrators of retcons because of the reboots but Marvel reverses or ignores crap in every new run on almost every single book. Most of the time they dont even bother offering an instory excuse for it or at most you get some vague unsatisfying catchall like the end of Secret Wars to justify letting new writers run wild with established personalities and histories.I call it the silent retcon and this was a big one. Overwriting such a popular and critucallyacclaimed story literally as soon as it ended just about tanked  the whole thing for me because continuity and longterm plot progression are two of the largest reasons I read Big Two comics in the first place.

I was kind of hopeful that Secret Wars and the ANAD relaunch would help address it on the Marvel side some but AFAIK it did nothing unless we find out in a few years that stuff after ANAD is real time but then you run into aging problems but push the timeline forward  months which would have taken something like  years real time otherwise.Eventually Marvels going to need to reboot go the MC route or go the DC fuck continuity route none of which would be very optimal but all of which would be preferable to reaching the absurd point where  years of real time comics translates to lt year in universe.,comicbooks,d1nd765,7,t5_2qhon

In regard to Snyder I have my reservations as well. I dont like his method of filmmaking where everything is about looks and flash pun unintended and the very little substance he tries to add is simple at best. It doesnt seem like hes too open to criticisms since a lot of the problems in MoS are also somewhat present in BvS and while he tried to address some of them his attempts were somewhat laughable if Im honest.

Imagine judging Game of Thrones simply by the scene where Daenerys is traded to Khal Drogo. That is one scene in a much larger character arc just like this and until we see it all play out we should reserve judgment.I also think that this is is a realistic reaction for Miles.

I think well see him grow a lot by the end of this arc.

The Monster Society of Evil collection is pretty much a must for anyone even slightly interested in where the superhero thing started. It has everything you could want and some things you likely didnt realize you needed.From Gold Key the Turok and Magnus comics are fun superherotinged action titles doneinone stories and even though Solar is the main draw Doctor Spektor is the most intriguing title the company ever published. Ignore Mighty Samson unless you really want to torture yourself  it is hard to think of another title which goes at its message with such a heavy hand. The comics are relatively cheap the stories are entertaining and they really did have better adverts back then.From First Badger Sable and Nexus should cover the important characters  Badger is the definition of a fun read while Nexus... is complicated. Just read it. You will be doing yourself a favor.Image  Savage Dragon skews tropes left right and center pulls out a remarkable amount of characterization for a comic about a green dude with a fin on his head. Spawn... Meh. Some people think the character is great but it leaves me cold. Invincible is entertaining and genuinely gripping.Be forewarned that a lot of the mids superhero material Image Comics produced is unreadable garbage but it wasnt just Liefeld so make sure you know what versions of longrunning characters you are buying. The artwork on Brigade is so bad that the wings fall off angels backs puppy dogs die and Satan gets an erection every time someone speaks highly of the title.Essential titles... Okay read Madman  or pretty much anything Mike Allred has been involved with.The Zenith collections if you can get them set the stage for all the attentionwhore characters who came later.Give Den a chance  it isnt just a ConanmeetsAlice in Wonderland stew and some of the artwork really does shine.tldr dont settle for the latest fad go hunt out cool shit.,comicbooks,d20qqsr,1,t5_2qhon

Are STDs bad yes! you know what can solve that. A simple conversation with a child on the concept of STDs. You sound like the crazy antigay marriage nut jobs. O know how am I supposed to explain two men kissing to my kids. You are also making the same right wing argument that media deceptions of sex increase sexual activity when the opposite is true. Sex drives cause sexuality activity not the media. How do you not see the parallels between what you are saying and the crazy religious nut jobs of the past?

7276991,0,t1_d247pc0,Yes. I could never get any comics as a minor because you either needed to order them online or go to a certain store for them stores which didnt exist for miles and miles. My father would occasionally facilitate for that but generally didnt and my mother never cared to help me get any. When my father died when I was eleven I basically had no means to get any comics because they simply werent sold anywhere near me. It was until around when they started carrying comics in a bookstore that was a five mile hike away that I could actually get any access to any sort of comics and the selection wasnt exactly varied. Technically there was a comic book store closer to me but it had a lot of faults common to them. It wasnt new reader friendly it wouldnt bother to facilitate somebody who couldnt spend  on comics every week the owner was an asshole who acted like he needed to protect the comicbook fandom but perceived invaders etc.You need to carry comic books in places like WalMart if some people are going to have any access to comic books especially given that most convenience stores dont carry comics anymore. My cousins had it worse than I did. They lived out in the boonies so far away that WalMart the closest real store was over an hours drive away. People like that are in a situation that if WalMart doesnt stock it they dont get it and that includes comics,comicbooks,d25cft3,2,t5_2qhon

7290887,0,t3_4f95f4,Its a pretty big group of people who read comics. Different people like different things. Hard to get a unanimously positive reaction to anything.Some of what youre touching on is an issue with serialization. For example the rich Peter Parker thing. The people who have a strong negative reaction to it usually arent people who hate comics. Theyre people who love certain qualities of Peter Parker and resent that these qualities will not be present in his stories for a while. People who were looking forward to next months installment of this story and are disappointed to find that theyre no longer looking forward to it now that the storys taken a turn they dislike.A lot of mediums and genres are less big on serialization. A trilogy of fantasy novels for example will never become so thoroughly ingrained in your life to the point that youd miss it if you ended up going a month without reading a new installment.Arguably the press around comics also creates a certain amount of spectacle. Using your example of the Jokers Name a reveal like that would likely be left to be discovered in the story itself if this were a scifi movie. It would then be mostly discussed between fans after watching the movie. When we put this sort of stuff in a press release it means a lot of people who may or may not even be following the comic talking about the announcement in abstract terms. Lets say John for example is a fan of the Nolan Batman movies but hasnt really been able to get into Snyders run of Batman. John comes here to discuss all his favorite comics when he sees a conversation going about this reveal and decides to give his two cents about how this tarnishes something he thinks is special about The Joker.

I love movies as much as comics and yet I see people shit on both instantly instead of being like um ok thats new. My niece in particular is very hard on things being a certain way. I am.not saying FF was fantastic and yea doom was pretty bad in that but I enjoyed it...she didnt. I just try to dance around to a new subject as not to get in a pissing match with a  year old nerd. I enjoy comic they way they are going...if I am not feeling the way its going i just stop reading and check out the extensive back log there is out there.

7295451,0,t3_4f98xg,I really enjoy the theory because I love tying togetherdiscovering implications of anything Morrison writes. Personally Im hoping the resurrection of Darkseid will lead to him conquering Earth prior to the Rock of Ages story. Ive always thought that he would come back more powerful yet insane than ever which is why he couldnt recall who Batman was the man who killed him.However I kinda doubt that DC has their shit figured out that well and I think they let Morrison do what he wants while it doesnt really affect the rest of the universe.

Those characters were definitely more popular among the KinderElementary students than any Japanese ones and while the teenagers I taught had started getting into Anime and Manga at that point there was still a very strong showing for western stuff when I did stuff like surveys or essays on that kind of thing.,comicbooks,d2852zu,2,t5_2qhon
7301654,0,t3_4fczqv,. Superman is one word.  . Supermans colors are red blue and yellow.  Not lavender crimson and maroon.    . Supermans emblem is not a white S in a standard serif font  Theres a reason people will not leave Superman alone.  He is an American hero who stands for Truth Justice and the American Way.  He is not corruptible.  He doesnt kill people.  He has a code of honor.  And for those reasons he must be destroyed.  If not by fictional villains then by the people who own his likeness.  DC and Hollywood hate Superman with a seething spitting intensity.  They tolerate him.  They do not celebrate him.  They will never celebrate him.  This is why Marvel wins.  Captain America is not corrupted even by people who by all rights should hate everything he stands for.   Yet they allow him to stand for it which makes those people at least as honorable as their character.  For all intents and purposes Superman died when he killed Zod in Man of Steel.  Whatever this impostor is or whomever heit becomes has nothing to do with the character that returned the American flag to the White House and promised the president he wouldnt fail again.  Edit Every downvote proves me right.  Even comic readers hate Superman.  Thats probably why DC keeps trying to turn him into anything but himself.  ,comicbooks,d285cwn,-11,t5_2qhon

7403839,0,t1_d2jqcxs,Well written hats off to you. Its a tricky maze to navigate progressivism. Road to hell is paved with good intentions. I generally support sentiments of itd be nice to see more people like me because its a simple selfish want I can identify with. But the problem is that much of the time like youve noted is that people arent speaking in macro general terms on what theyd like to see happen they are attacking well intending people that just want to make good products. The worst is when these people not only try to attack people or casting decisions they qualify eligibility of a role by race. It seems to be replacing the prejudice of the classic no people of color allowed in Hollywood thing with theres too many whites in Hollywood. It seems regressive. In the same way some bigots will talk about direct ways the government subsidizes the lives of the poor black communities they didnt earn what they have the more left leaning people that wish to bring balance and diversity have a way of dehumanizing people they feel have it too good. Its okay to discriminate because X demographic has X privilege. Its regressive to be okay with being prejudiced just because another group was oppressed before.Anyway thats my feeling in social justice specifically relating to casting. I like larger movements about creating more diverse works of entertainment but when people decide its justifiable to try to reduce someones legitimacy or tell them theyre ineligible because of some sort of racist skin tone test Im off.

I absolutely agree with you. The recap page suggests that Miles still got the powers from the Ultimate Universes genetically engineered spider but youre right  why be SpiderMan in a world where the original is alive and well?Its funny to see that after all the Secret Wars drama to collapse the universes and bring Miles into the main continuity Jason Latour quietly created a new pocket universe character with Earths Gwen Stacy who can casually transport herself between universes so she keeps her own unique altcontinuity while teaming with others ifas necessary.,comicbooks,d2lfblv,1,t5_2qhon

It appears so.But if you were really educated about art specifically comic book art you would know how rare it is to find actual good art in monthly mainstream comics. You would know how often panels are repeated how prevalent swiping is and why superheroes wear spandex and all have the same physique in the first place. Its because figure drawing is quicker when the only clothing you have to worry about is a belt and a cape. Let the colorist differentiate them from each other.,comicbooks,d313u27,3,t5_2qhon

7558905,0,t1_d31dpao,gt  Tonys behaviour and actions in previous films go completely against how he acts in this oneActually I think his behavior actually leads up to his decision rather appropriately. Theres a constant theme with Tony in regards to control and this movie gives us the biggest revelation that hes been dancing around in the previous movies Tony doesnt want to be in control.    He wasnt prepared for the scale of things when Avengers happened. Aliens Gods portals to another universe Tony doesnt know what to do with that. His weapons falling into the wrong hands? Thats fine that was a mistake he made so he can put on his suit and blast some things.  But when it comes to world ending threats and all the powers being thrown around Tony is out of his element. All those things culminated with Tony almost dying in the middle of space. That shock never left his system.   Come AoU and Tony is trying to get the ultron program working because its his solution to the problem. Its like he told cap Arnt we fighting so we can go home? He doesnt want to do it anymore and he wants out but he continues to do so because hes burdened by guilt and responsibility. By having the Ultron protocol he can essentially do his part to keep the world safe but also be able to back down.  Then the events of Sokovia happen and turns out that another choice Tony made caused a tragedy. At this point its too much for him and he finally admits that hes done. Tony doesnt want to be the one pulling the trigger anymore he doesnt want to be the person that makes the choices which up to this point have been the wrong choices. So when the government steps in and offers them a way out hes more than happy to jump in and agree.  By him signing the Sokovia accords it means hes no longer responsible for making those hard calls. He doesnt need to worry about the outcome of making a horrible decision like Ultron again. It was a decision made out of fear.,comicbooks,d31et3o,47,t5_2qhon

It is not women who are targeted it is not PoCs which are targeted it is people who are trying to disrupt that are being targeted regardless of their own race or gender and that is a reasonable pushback to be expected from people who enjoy the medium for what it already is.gt Yes and those people who are being targeted are blameless and the people who are targeting them are shameless bigots.Wrong on both counts. The people being targeted are not blameless they are actively engaged in a campaign of destruction and pushback would be both expected and warranted. And the people targeting them may include shameless bigots but you dont have to be bigoted to defend the industry that you enjoy from external attack. gtOne of the most important areas is in regards to laws around sexual harassment and sexual assault. i believe that the way we enforce and prosecute those laws are woefully woefully inadequate in part because those laws are based on a woefully anachronistic understanding of the causes circumstances and effects of such crimes.So what changes would you suggest that would not circumvent due process and reasonable doubt?gtSo in other words Mr. ShowMeTheEvidence your remedies are the ones that we have no proof of. Yes. Im saying that none of us on the outside are in any position to judge the situation at all.

If there are less than  women in a field it has more to do with reduced interest than with reduced opportunity. There just arent nearly as many women applying for these jobs and therefore less qualified applicants and therefore less hires. Theres nothing sinister going on to give that result and theres nothing wrong about that which would need fixing.Its almost cute how naive you arecool for me not the time or place to have a discussion on inequality or systemic social disparity.gt Most comic characters are white because most of them were created over  years ago when it would have been practically impossible to lead a book with a nonwhite character. Of characters created within the past decade almost none of them have been straightwhitemale. As for women being sexualized the men are sexualized too its just that what a sexualized man looks like is different than what a sexualized woman looks like since men and women tend to look for different things in their partners.

Also untrue. DC had a  year head start working in the Hollywood studio system before Marvel and managed to wow both critics and fans by trying both of those tones with the Superman and Batman franchises respectively. Then they rebooted Batman and did it a second time raising the bar for the quality that people expect out of a superhero adaptation. It was Marvel that needed to pick up the gauntlet and get peoples attention after the parade of fanderided critical failures that follow Elektra  Fantastic Four  XMen The Last Stand  Ghost Rider  SpiderMan   Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer . The tone of most of those films couldnt be further from the Nolandirected Batman trilogy that WB was releasing at the same time  a series of films which were nominated for  Academy Awards.

7827279,0,t3_4mi4l5,I like the ideas youre throwing around but I think the end result will be the return of the more traditional Marvel U albeit with a few minor changes still intact. All these cosmic cube shenanigans mixed with Al Ewings Contest of Champions and The Ultimates exploring the greater concepts of the new Marvel U leads me to believe a soft reset is coming.For instance Steve Rogers will most likely be the only Captain America and not a Hydra agent Thor will be the Odinson again and the Inhumans will have a standing on Earth akin to the XMen in the late searly s as in there will be a lot of them but they wont be in peril of perpetual extinction like the mutants have been since .Of course Miles will still be swinging around as SpiderMan Kamala Khan will still be Ms. Marvel and the AllNew AllDifferent Avengers will still most likely be the flagship team kind of? although with a new roster.The past few years have been a weird juxtaposition of constant events and awesome character work i.e.  Original Sin and AXIS in the same year but also titles like Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Weirdworld Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Power Man and Iron Fist etc. so it wouldnt surprise me if Marvel is taking a cue from DC and going for a more cohesive shared universe now that they have a number of popular characters that fans want to see back in the spotlight.,comicbooks,d3vupgl,2,t5_2qhon

7872239,0,t3_4n55vb,Batman is a very boring character. Hes the ultimate Mary Sue doesnt matter who writes him. People complain that Superman is boring because no threat can harm him but Batman is way worse.His level of pop culture popularity makes this so much worse. Nothing can really be done to the character. Any status quo change is immediately reverted there is no lasting change or real character development and hes a pretty onedimensional character to begin with.EDIT A few more. I really dont mind the idea of frequent relaunches. Now I dont think it has to happen with every title and when it does it doesnt need to be a huge deal. But the idea of taking an approach like a series of miniseries or like TV seasons is not a bad idea. I just think publishers ie Marvel needs to make it clear somehow that this is season  or volume  or whatever.  DnAs Guardians of the Galaxy is loved not because it was a great book but because people like to hate on Bendis. I mean it certainly wasnt bad and I really enjoyed it at times but it suffered from inconsistent art over reliance on events and too much continuity. And for a series that drew heavily from Starlins cosmic Marvel it went really light on the deep concepts. Now it was probably better than the Bendis relaunch but if it was as great as people around here say it is it would have never been cancelled in the first place. Plus half writing the team is currently writing a Guardians of the Galaxy book featuring a number of the same characters and its largely ignored around here. ,comicbooks,d40wua6,14,t5_2qhon

It is not a bad title in fact it is great  its just not a title for your acquired taste. Im astonished that Marvel allowed him to take so many jabs at Marvels publishing strategies e.g. Civil War II and AllNew AllDifferent Now etc in the most recent issue. Fans rejoiced at the character development of Billy amp Teddy. I personally enjoy the more oldschool portrayal of Squirrel Girl compared to her solo title. Songbirds deal is exactly the same she always did in the past except she has finally become an Avenger. Hickmans favorite character Sunspot has also been elevated to a new level of awesomeness and Ewing inserted random details of his from Claremont New Mutants era that Hickman probably has forgotten about. He also gave back Cannonball his accent. And remember Maker comes in slices he has changed since his Ultimate time.  The same goes for Ewings Contest of Champions. Its pure random fun with a number of awesomely resurrected dead characters starring the criminallyunderusedbyHickmansSecretWars Maestro.

7990570,0,t3_4okk5x,Denny ONeil for me.To be fair the only Mike Grell stuff Ive read is The Longbow Hunters. I really need to rectify that soon. Quick question Grells main GA series takes place after Longbow Hunters correct?Lemires run was really good but I think a large part of that is due to the art. New  Ollie is far from what I consider definitive but thats not Lemires fault.Im also still a big fan of Kevin Smiths run where he brought Ollie back to life and Meltzers followup story was fantastic on a character level there were a few hiccups in comic book logic though. I consider Archers Quest to be one of the best Green Arrow stories and Meltzer handled the character excellently in Identity Crisis as well.And while he never wrote a Green Arrow comic I love the fact that Frank Miller included Ollie in The Dark Knight Returns. His involvement is one of my favorite aspects of that story and Ive been fascinated with the idea of a onearmed Green Arrow since I was a little kid looking at my brothers copy of DKR.,comicbooks,d4e7snn,1,t5_2qhon
7991561,0,t1_d4e7snn,Mike Grell wrote arrow for  issues....I was not even an Arrow fan I just read it cause Geoff Johns said it was on his reading list for Christmas if it impressed a writer of his calibur it just had to be more than great. I went in expecting a dated overly texted based book but I found something more than that. This is a white male with blonde and blues eyes who actually cares about minorities and the cultural issues we have in the west. The book had me hook the story was realistic in every sense not every chapter he won and not every chapter he gave into optimism he understood the world is broken but refuse for the world to brake him. I literally sat down for TWO DAYS straight just taking my time and reading absorbing this fictional book that wasnt even fictional I had never experienced half of these things but I felt the outcry of people who suffered when I read it. Ollie wasnt like Batman who had cool gadgetsSuper intellect and colorful psychos to fighthe wasnt like  Daredevil had sonar hearing and could scale massive buildings and he wasnt like The Punisher a mad man out to kill. This was a political man who accepted and understood if their needs to be change it has to start with him with ISISBlack Lives matter movement and the Orlando shootings Mike Grells GreenArrow is much more relevant than any other streetlevel hero on the shelves....,comicbooks,d4ebsrj,1,t5_2qhon

8014111,0,t3_4ozn1g,I know plenty of you are stoked on this but let us be realistic. Flashpoint was engaging because we got to see new and interesting takes on established super heroes. Bruce Wayne is dead Clark Kent never was and instead Kal El was seized by the government Aquaman vs Wonder Woman and the Amazons and so forth.Do we have any of that in the series? Oh Heelllllllll NO! Realistically were going to end up with an Iris who is bitchy in a new way a more brutal Joe a limp dick Cisco and a knock off of evil Caitlyn. Flashpoint was interesting because it was different in so many ways. How can that happen when we just saw a season that featured dopplegangers from a parallel Earth?I want to be on board with this hype train but I thought the finale was utter crap. Once again it was  minutes of waiting around to do something then doing it in a rather overly complicated way. I love this show I really do but sometimes the drivel gets too bad to swallow. I guess what Im saying is please no! Lets move forward not rehash storylines that need a cast of the Justice League to stand on.s At the end of the finale we watch Barry save his mom and his past self fades away!

8079755,0,t1_d4o7lkb,gtIf you want to be literal then the fact that I said technically should be enough.Similar is not the same. You started this off by saying some people read manga and not comics. Several times you spoke of the two as being separate entities. You later claimed youd never said manga werent comics but thats exactly what it means when you say things like that. Again I think the issue is that youre using comics and American comics interchangeably at times. So since you meant American comics you may think you never said it but thats how it would easily be interpreted.gtThere is a distinction between American comics and manga.No disagreement there. But thats not the issue. I dont think thered be any argument if youd said Western or American to start with which is what I think you meant.gtThats why when referring to the Marvel movies media refers to them as comic book adaptions while manga adaptations are specifically called out as that.Media often treats comic books as meaning superhero books and calls everything else graphic novels so I dont really worry about that.gtThat being said everything Im saying is in American terms. If you are in another country then the language is probably different and why you dont see my points the way I do. No Im American I just mean comics from anywhere when I say comics so I wouldnt juxtapose manga vs. comics in a sentence. I think you should say American comics if thats what you mean.

I cant remember if its the  mm bags and up or only the  mm bags but some of theirs are sturdy enough that theres no point in using a board.Another product the CGS guys rave about is DrawerBoxes.   Those would be useful if you had a large collection.,comicbooks,d4o91az,3,t5_2qhon

It even goes over in more laborious detail Victors fears about becoming Victorious which was covered very well last issue.Thats not to say I didnt think it was a good issue.

Everything else was either painfully predictable laughtrack sitcoms or serious drama shows where somehow no one in any walk of life used adult language and people covered their bodies religiously with bedsheets around their SOs.  And dont even get me started on religion.  It was completely above criticism.  The general public could be forgiven for wondering if nonbelievers even existed.  Within that context the profane and blasphemous stuff in Preacher was a breath of fresh air.  Im sure it was very satisfying for Ennis to let loose with that stuff and it was very satisfying for us young adult readers of the time who were tired of being clubbed over the head with censored formulaic content all the time.,comicbooks,d5frp4y,3,t5_2qhon

Swamp Thing The Root of All Evil is such a bad story in general but because Swampy has had such fantastic tales before this it sticks out as particularly bad. The story lacks direction you can tell the author dislikes Abby and immediately writes her out and everyone in it is just so angry for no real reason. Its a convuluted mess.

Theres normally a correlation between monthly sales and trade sales. If monthly sales are low the trade sells poorly and if monthly sales are high it sells well.So if everyone holds off on the monthlies that tends to translate into poor selling trades maybe because theres no wordofmouth about how great it is leading up to the trade being available. In turn theres less reason for Marvel to invest in keeping the monthly around.Im not saying thats  the correct business model but it makes sense from their perspective and if those correlations exist its not them not wanting your money its them trying to be smart in how they invest their revenue.Its a tricky balance.

DC admitted they screwed up taking the blame and working actively to get better. They gave the fans what the fans has been asking for years instead of Marvels what? Too many events?

Batman earned and uses his amazing abs to save lives and because male physical expectations arent as oppressive though admittedly and this is also a view born from feminism it is also a problem.Exactlyexaggerating certain aspects of characters is fundamentally different between male and female characters. The elements of male characters that are most often enhanced are traits involving fitness size or height the elements that represent power and strength with female characters on the other hand the traits most frequently emphasized are those which are made for men to ogle at that make them into figures subservient to males.

The silhouetteedge of the coat would look better with more confident lines  instead of a nervous line with small sshaped curves in it make it a strong line with large curves.

So that that percentage is not at all representative of how likely a black man is about to murder someone nor how likely you are to be murdered by a black man.If Im not mistaken the majority of those murders you mentioned are black men killing other black men usually in a criminal context aside from the murdering someone part obvoiusly. Assuming youre not a black man selling drugs to the community this context probably does not apply to you. So take out that bias from the overall statistics and you get a very different picture.For just about anyone from any background its still most likely that you are murdered by a family member IIRC.,comicbooks,d6blfbh,6,t5_2qhon

Sometimes it works really well and sticks sometimes its hamfisted and gets rewritten shortly afterwards but its all part of the ongoing process of making these comic book stories.

They showed up to help Bruce but Hugo Strange broke PsychoPirate out of prison and used him to infect Gotham with anger and Gotham Girl with fear.

Many people believe he defined Batman but while his work is really influential long before that Denny ONeil amp Neal Adams did some exceptional work in the s. Check out the whole Denny ONeil era not just the ones drawn by Neal Adams. A lot of it was drawn by Irv Novick.Alan Grant amp Norm Breyfogle. Shortly after Miller. Another great time to be a Batman fan.In this century Morrisons run is epic and amazing even though Morrisons style is not for anyone. But if its for you... boy what an epic ride! Seriously that guy is a genius. It shouldnt be the first Batman to be read however. Its just Morrison doing different things with Batman while at the same time respecting the characters roots.Also check out Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers Detective Comics.  ...There are many other good runs but those could be a place to start.,comicbooks,d6s4xhz,1,t5_2qhon

The problem isnt that it just happens on Reddit though its that women have a long history of having their looks tide to everything they do and having their  appearance overlook their accomplishments. People in this thread complimented OP without bringing up her appearance they didnt feel the need to because she isnt ridiculously photogenic like that meme you used as a reference. Theyre talking about her artwork and what it says about her as was the point of the post. No one is afraid to compliment her appearance it just isnt that relevant. Also calling her pretty simply because you think she is prettier than the rest of the group isnt a good complement and it puts down the other women who are most likely her friends. ,comicbooks,d72srdm,3,t5_2qhon

Whether he wanted the fame for himself or not its pretty hard to say that he didnt constantly use that fame for the benefit of comic books.And I mean Kirby and Ditko probably had to work a lot harder and got paid less but given the insane boatloads of cash their characters have made all three of them probably should have been much much richer than they ended up. Especially Kirby.And I do have a hard time believing Kirbys claims that Lee never wrote any of the dialogue when you can pick up some story hes written for a Spidey anniversary or for What If Stan Lee etc in the last  or  years and it sounds exactly the same as it did in the s. The same wordiness the same patter.Still Im sure someone could do a content analysis on all the comics that hes supposed to have written and get a much better idea of who wrote what though.,comicbooks,d73q5j5,8,t5_2qhon

8846240,0,t3_51cwhw,Superman  The big blue boy scout. The oldest the greatest. Clark represents the goodness in all of us. Clark represents the common man in all of us. Surprising how hes an alien and yet hes the most human of all heroes. Hes what we strive towards. He leads us by example. He is one man who even though has the most power but is the most good. He knows that if you try to hit him youll break your hand. He knows that he can bully anyone. And yet helps out the little guy.He haa punched planets. Held bloody infinity. Saved the earth a million times. And then he comes back to save a girl who is incredibly close to committing suicide. Superman inspires me to be a good man. That you dont have to Mask your face to do good. You dont have to hide in the shadows to be a good person. Clark never had to go through a tragedy like Batman did. Sure his planet exploded. But he was lucky enough to land in a farm and in arms of two wonderful parents who were blessed by a baby boy they otherwise never would have received. And they taught him well. Like most of our parents do. They teach us to be good humans. The reason Clark is Superman and not a villain is because he listened to his parents and realised that it doesnt matter if you have powers or not. It doesnt matter if you can fly or not.At the end of the day Clark isnt about being Super. Hes about being the Man.,comicbooks,d7b6y59,5,t5_2qhon

Y the last man   closes out an awesome series with crippling gut punch after crippling gut punch. Im still reeling.    vision   I know I should basically just exclude this because I just essentially listed the entire series but its too hard to choose only one. All of these issues could be said to be the greatest of the seriesalltime and youd hear no complaints from me.  did a great job in establishing that this was going to be no easy read  hit everybody right in the gut it just goes through me.  p vs np was a great buildup to the avengers reveal and  and  just tear your fucking heart out. One of my favorite series in years.    hawkeye   hard to choose just one for this series but the first issue hell the first page established itself as a unique and intimate take on hawkguy.    moon knight   shalveys art alone could make this list.    secret wars   now that the delays are behind us and we can look at judge the eventHickmans run as a whole its hard to imagine a better send off to his marvel work than SW .    the fix   this was just too perfect. Managed to become one of my favorite ongoings before Id even finished the first issue.    doom patrol  the beard hunter cant remember the issue number but fuck I nearly cried from laughing so hard the first time I read this. Ozone free? You bet.    grayson  futures end great to see a typical tom King issue before it was really a thing. I remember being blown away the first time thinking who writes a story like this? I love it! Tom fucking King thats who.    DC Rebirth  shattered my expectations and ushered in the dawn of a new era in The DC universe.    But if I were to choose just one from the last few years my favorite would have to be..    green lantern darkseid war one shot by tom king  no surprises here really tom King just doing tomthings.

Ive had this done with my Avengers The Initiative TPBs I didnt like how they reprinted some issues out of order and Im currently doing it with my Uncanny XMen run which is in a mixture of TPBs and floppies.The best way is to use heat hold them over the stove for  seconds in order to melt the glue holding the binding together just enough to carefully pull off the cover.  Then just also remove any pages from the front and back you dont want.  You can also cut TPBs in half in order to splice in other stuff if you wanted to change the ordering or whatever.

9009406,0,t3_53lmn6,My lists have been a little sparse for the past month or so but its seeming to ramp up this week and for the next several. Batman  Bats Dick and Kate fight monsters. This has the potential to be really fun. Black Hammer  Ive enjoyed the first two books of this. The characters are very...unique. Britannia  Ive been looking to get into some Valiant books and this one looks pretty cool so here we go. Civil War II  It feels like forever since the last book came out and I have a hard time remembering whats happening. Thats the sign of a good book right? International Iron Man I firmly believe that this story has gotten worse with each book which is unfortunate because I really liked the first couple. Justice League  Im so behind on this book. Since this is the end of the arc Ill just read it all at once I guess. Micronauts  Is it going to be hard to follow this with Revolution starting? Or should I just bite the bullet and pick that up too? Nightwing  This comes out the same week as Batman? So much Bat Family and I love it. Patsy Walker AKA Hellcat!  This is my favorite Marvel book right now. I love Brittney Williams on the art and the story can be really strong for a  more young adult audience. Also I hope Hedy gets whats coming to her. The Punisher  Seven To Eternity  Since this book was announced Ive been super excited to sink my teeth into it and the day has finally arrived! Super Human Resources I can count on at least  hearty chuckles per book from this. Its so funny. Superman  Epilogue books arent my cup of tea but oh well. The Astonishing AntMan  Im going to miss this book when Now . starts up. The XFiles  This is my last month of pulling this book. Its not bad its just not worth it to me.

9015848,0,t3_53offg,Cerebus by Dave Sim.It starts off as a silly Conan parody then starts getting a little smarter and more experimental after issue  or so. Many people Dave Sim included recommend you start at issue  or the TPB High Society then read the early stuff after although I personally think you should read from the beginning because there are characters and places introduced in those issues that become important later.Then at issue  it turns into allout satirical political satire then things start to get weirder and it turns into a satire on religion politics and gender roles then theres a retelling if the final days of Oscar Wilde and things go supremely meta and we get a commentary on the authors relationship with his creation and a readers relationship with both of them complete with a short story with the reader getting dragged into the book.Its long and uneven and very very odd plus at one point the creator Dave Sim had a mental breakdown and it started leaking into the work opinions are divided over which part of the story this starts to happen and at which point it stops being worth reading because things take a turn for the worse and start to become offensive but for my money the first  issues are some of the smartest funniest and most insightful comics Ive ever read and while the  issues that follow are where it starts to get noticeably more problematic in the viewpoints Sim expresses not to mention harder to get through  the storyline Reads is  made up of prose passages theres still a lot of worthwhile stuff in there. Im yet to read issues  and thats where I hear it gets real hard but honestly those final  issues could be a garbage fire and I still wouldnt regret reading the first .Plus the art is crazy good. Theres gorgeous spreads  experimental comedy  and brutal fights  The whole series is collected in cheap as hell phonebook trades that collect an average of  issues each  the first two are available to download for free on Sims website.,comicbooks,d7vkca7,3,t5_2qhon

9049680,0,t1_d7ys3yc,I did the fun and easy part. Ideas are a lot easier than execution. And great execution can make up for meh ideas. I imagine Id be  a terrible editor. Either too controlling or too undercontrolling. And of course most the stuff you do isnt really about the books but about making sure everything is in on time and generally managing things. Thinking up the line with the creators or doing it yourself then assigning books or just hiring a bunch of British gods to do whatever and finding a budget for great artists is just one part of the gig.If only I wasnt a pretty eh writer I could probably have a decent go at writing at least.  Even Marvel method the absolute most scripts you can do a month is like  consistently. Still that is enough. XMen is usually at its best when theres a clear person or two doing exactly what they want. Claremont Morrison Gillen and Bendis Ill make myself unpopular and say Bendiss run was pretty damn good particularly towards the end and wish hed stayed another year at least were high points.The key to XMen is to have strong individual books that usually do their own stuff but do tie in to a sort of central story somehow.  Its why the DecimationHope stuff was good and also why the InhumansTerrigen mist stuff isnt actually bad. The issue is that theres not a lot going on for a bunch of characters who are present or are distractions. Time travelling  and OML dont really fit but are too central. Characters who feel ephemeral and out of touch with the main story are bad to have as pretty major characters.Totally a fun exercise though. I imagine there are half a dozen other ways of organizing the line that have little resemblance to this formulation.,comicbooks,d7zmlgu,1,t5_2qhon

I visit  local shops and all of them have the same issues ordered items are late or missing items arrive damaged quantities incorrect etc.  If Diamond has to replace or resend stock it can be hit or miss.  If they have stock available and it arrives when they say it will great.  If theyre out of stock then youre out of luck.  If theyre waiting on another printing its anybodys guess.If my shop is missing something from my pull list its disappointing but I know its not their fault.

Inside the magnetic field Erik is preserved in there until one day Charles Xavier the same age as the boy detects him under the surface and guides him out of his metal cocoon and he starts living in this strange new world with Xavier.This way you keep the Holocaust origin for him and give him some extra layers by making him a dark analogue to Captain America.,comicbooks,d806nn0,1,t5_2qhon

9078429,0,t3_54mfna,Youve completely mixed things up. Postcrisis is . New  which was in  is when everything but Batman and Green Lantern got rebooted by flashpoint.gtBatman has been at it a while with Dick Grayson as Robin postCrisis opens up with Year One which is clearly a flashback story and then jumps into immediately setting up Jason Todd as the new Robin. Dick has come and gone.Yep Dick had graduated to Nightwing in the s New Teen Titans series by Wolfman and PerezgtThe first GL book postCrisis was a continuation of the preCrisis volume but was renamed to Green Lantern Corps and starts off with Hal John and Guy all as established human Lanterns. Kyle becomes a lantern and heads the series very shortly afterwards.YepgtThe preCrisis Flash volume ends with Wally as Kid Flash taking up the mantle of the Flash or promising to and after COIE the Flash book is actually Wally West. So Barry has already come and gone?Literally ever bit of Flash lore that wasnt multiverse remained and the multiverse stuff was retconned so that Jay is still there on the same earth. Barry dies in COIE and Wallys series takes place after that. Barry doesnt come back until  but all the best flash stuff is c.gtWonder Woman does get a new origin and numbering. But does it jump ahead in time after the origin like Batman? Or does her postCrisis series show her early days?The origin part of her postcrisis series is set in the present its why she was no longer a founding JL membergtSuperman gets Byrnes Man of Steel series then a new  with Adventures of Superman? Are these his early days? Or is Man of Steel just a new origin then we go back to an established Superman?IIRC Man of Steel is the origin and then the rest of Byrnes stuff is just normal present day SupesgtSame deal with Aquaman we get a new origin but do we get a new Aquaman.Well is origin is pretty different so you could say thatgtSo and this surprised me a bit but the Justice League as I would think of as the classic members basically never existed between COIE and Flashpoint right? Im used to Batman Superman Wonder Woman Flash GL Aquaman and Martian Manhunter as the main . After New  the team had  of those members but Im seeing Batman Black Canary Blue Beetle Captain Marvel Doctor Fate Doctor Light Guy Gardner Martian Manhunter Mister Miracle and Oberon as the first ever postCrisis Justice League? But it also seems like in their history other teams existed before them so does the classic team only exist as a legacy team between  and Flashpoint like the Justice Society exist as being an even older team on New Earth?No the clist Justice League International team you mentioned were just the roster at the time. The postcrisis founders were Flash Barry Green Lantern Hal Black Canary Martian Manhunter and Aquaman with Batman Superman Green Arrow Atom etc joining later. After  after Infinite Crisis the Trinity are founding members again. JLA Year One is a brilliant postcrisis origin story. JLA  by Morrison brings back the classic seven with Wally and Kyle for obvious reasons.gtI know Wolfmans New Teen Titans most resembles the team I would know from the cartoon but did the original team exist before them in their continuity? How is Wally Kid Flash on this team if hes also the actual Flash? How is Wonder Girl active if Wonder Woman is new on the scene?Yes the original team existed. It was like  years between the TT first forming and when Wally is the Flash and he left the NTT before Barry died. Wonder GirlDonna Troy is just a continuity headache,comicbooks,d832vuy,11,t5_2qhon

And if Bruce is going to cross that line I think it would have to be only to save someone he cares deeply for like Barb or Dick. If were trying to show a fallen Bruce I think the branding thing was a great way to take him to the edge of that cliff.  But unfortunately the few good ideas brought forth in that movie get lost in all the noise and unrepentant killing.  I also dislike not seeing the defining moment that threw him over the edge.  If youre going to take the character into uncharted territory you better damn well better give me a compelling reason to follow.  Instead of stupid alternate universe set pieces and dream sequences why cant he be haunted by that moment where he finds Jasons body?  It would have given us a much deeper understanding of why he became so callous.  And yeah most of the time his movie kills are ambiguous or bad editing.  He definitely did kill Ras Al Ghul in Begins.  If you have the power to save someone and you dont do it out of malice thats murder. ,comicbooks,d8clh05,2,t5_2qhon

Civil War II has actually been one of the better Marvel events of recent memory and is way better than people are giving it credit for.With regards to Carol Danvers acting in an unlikable manner is not the same as acting out of character. All of Carols actions recently have been consistent with how her character would act when put under the level of stress she recently has been put under.Jason Aarons Thor has been consistently good and yes Im including the first volume of JaneThor.Cyclops is boring as shit and even Joss Whedon was barely able to make him tolerable.Marvels diversity push has created some of the most interesting and welldeveloped stories and characters of the last twenty years and has overall been a complete success. BvS was better than Civil War on a pretty basic level. Thats because BvS is much much better than it often gets credit for and CW is much much worse.Luke Cage has been the strongest Marvel netflix series so far simply because it managed to actually have a quality finale that built on the previous episodes in a satisfying way something that none of the others managed to do. I still love them all though.I actually like Dan Slotts SpiderMan just fine. Garth Ennis Preacher is just okay. So far the show has been better.Half of you are saying the same two or three things and getting a fair amount of upvotes suggesting that your opinions arent all that unpopular.

9183498,0,t3_55zq15,I hate crossovers. Big major story that spans over several series? Maybe once every few years. But please not ever other arc. Especially if theyre going to be spanning over  or more books for more than  issues a piece. And then turn around and do it again  arcs later. Batman comes to mind. It seems like every time something big happens in Batman every bat book has to contribute. Why not just do oneshot tie ins for each character. Then you wouldnt have to interrupt on goings in the on goings.

Im seeing him as a more benevolent Lex Luthor focused on improving his city as much as possible eliminating the need for superheroes very Luthor in The Nail.Its hard to do Cap because a place like Brooklyn already exemplifies him well enough. Or DC. Hard to place him in a very fictional city. Black Widow is a superspy an international nomad and I dont see her having a base of operations. Thor has Asgard but you could argue he gets displaced in another city lets call it Midgard City a land where displaced Mythical creatures often hope off the Bifrost. Its his job to guard the city. While Im really not wellread in Thor I do remember him being in a small Oklahoma town a while back though Asgard was nearby. I kinda liked how middle America small town worked with him. Give Thor a more city like version of Smallville thats regularly attacked by Mythic beasts. Hes an outsider trying to fit in and a local guardian.Banner is hard too since hes really no ones hero. It has to be some sort of misfit outsider city. A place where a man with rage issues can fit in.

9385190,0,t1_d95mow3,One of the biggest misconceptions about movies is how much input the director has. Good or badeverything ends up landing on the director. Now obviously the director has some final say on what ends up on camera but most dialogue unless written by the director is not going to change. Auteur theory is easy to fall into because it allows the viewer to assign the very complex web of people needed to put a movie together and assign it to one person. There are very few pure Auteurs especially when we are talking big blockbuster movies. Even when we talk about the visuals in a movie very often we are praising the cinematographer or the editor or the production designer. Definitely a director probably has a hand in putting those pieces in place and has a voice but he or she is not the be all end all. Now Singer does do script work in these XMen so some dialogue issues can start and end with him but who knows how much. Much of the visual flair of Singers work can also be assigned to his cinematographer. Not to say Singer does not have a talent for working with actors and setting the scenehe certainly does. But the director probably gets too much credit and blame on any given project.,comicbooks,d95n036,12,t5_2qhon

9454430,0,t3_5a7sps,Captain Marvel  That was a dreaded moment and it had proven all expectations right. Seeing Crusher Creel reduced to a mysoginistic muppet took out all of my desire to familiarise myself with Carol Denvers.Captain Marvel  OK that one went down a little better. As in it still has a ton of stupid annoying stuff but at least it is readable without eyerolling  of the time. Although Carol does seem to have a habit of outgunning her opponents from the get go which sucks a lot of tension from the fights. Also it had some of the most forced humour ever. Ill read the first arc see if it gets better but Im not holding my breath.MARVEL Season OneI binged through all of graphic novels under this label lately. I would like to highlight Thor Doctor Strange XMen Hulk and possibly Wolverine if you want a kidfriendly Wolverine as essential reading for every fan of the characters  all of them put a decent spin on the origin of the character making it feel fresh again. On personal level I especially liked Hulk for fixing one of my biggest problems with the Gray GN  the absolute lack of spine in Betty Ross. The art is kinda wonky in all of them except for Thor and Wolveringe which are spectacular all the way through.Doctor Strange The OathSpectacular as expected. Art could be better but it was clean enough for me to enjoy it.Wolverine First ClassEh its fine but it does not live up to the hype. Logan training Kitty Pryde should have been bombastic but instead it is quite camp. Still some issues are rather good even if other can be rather dumb.Warren Elliss Moon KnightShould I say anything else? A work of a genius. Although Id prefer seeing more of an aftermath of each issue I get why Warren decided to refuse us closure  we do not follow the stories we follow Marc Spector and the moment a story ends for him it ends for us too.NEXTWAVE AGENTS OF HATEHilarious but a little overhyped. Id say it would have benefitted from longer run or smaller cast. Elsa in particular seems underused with her best moments being in her backstory.Doctor Strange The Mystic ApprenticeMarvel why? No seriously why? You had a perfect origin in Season One why did you need another one especially one so badly done? Its incredibly quippy compared to The Oath and Season One and would probably be a good companion to Aarons current run but it definitely loses a lot of subtlety. And I specifically refuse to compare it with any of the more sophisticated Strange Tales especially my favourite The Doctor Is Out. It just wont survive the comparison.SpiderMan BlueIncredibly overhyped. Its a good story but it definitely did not live up to my expectations. Its better than incredibly lame Hulk Gray but thats not saying a lot of things does it?Avengers The OriginSo incredibly meh... The art is good but constant exposition dumping gets old really fast. Its better than Avengers Season One but it is not much of an improvement.X Innocence LostTarget XIt was... interesting. While I enjoyed both parts of Lauras backstory Id say that I liked Innocence Lost more. Despite having inferior art and less stellar cast it was a much more balanced experience. Target X is a wild ride but I must say that at least one character in it acts completely unreasonable going against his established personality in the most defining run on the character. And while at the end they arrive to a decision that fits this personality the trail of actions and throughts that leads them there is... wonky at best. Replacing at least this character with an OC would make Target X an even more enjoyable experience.,comicbooks,d9eezl1,2,t5_2qhon

Now that a specific variant artist is tied to titles for I believe a year and the rest of the team tied to a title for  its not at all outside the realms of reason for the creative team to have some input on the style the variant artist wants to take as they will be together for a long time.

Problem is he excels at certain types of stories and instead they put him on every book under the sun because hes one of the most reliable workhorses in comics. So the style of writing that made him popular has now leaked into everything from Iron Man to Guardians to XMen and all of his characters now blur together and have become selfparodies. His claim to fame was a SpiderMan reboot so he also has a tendency to ignore continuity for his own purposes.Ive always thought that after he peaked they should have either given him Amazing SpiderMan or made him in EditorinChief. Hes split so many ways that the qualitys diluted badly and fans have turned on him.,comicbooks,d9jx53k,9,t5_2qhon

9503147,0,t1_d9jnxvc,gt I think theres a valid distinction between saying that she was drawn to look a bit too old which would be a valid criticism of most prior artists on the character and saying she was drawn like a porn star which many people have said as if possession of ccup breasts makes a girl into a porn star automatically.If you want me to argue on behalf of a vague many people using a label looks like a porn star that I havent used Im not sure I can do that. Even those people who would go a bridge too far with that criticism are still operating off of a root theme this child is drawn to look too old because comics artists default women as cheesecake whether they know it or not because they arent asked to pay attention to that by companies. gt I think its perfectly valid to criticize the art so long as you dont do so in a way that implies ill intent like implying that the reason the art is bad is because it is too sexual for an underage girl. Im sorry but all thats required to have a civil discussion here is to avoid the VERY avoidable dogwhistles.I dont think saying that something is too sexual is ill intent. I dont recall anyone with a platform saying J. Scott Campbell wants to have sex with underage girls. The point always seems to be superhero comics still cant shake themselves out of a cheesecake default to the point where even kids are drawn the same way.gtBut to bring it back around to the cover in question it is objectively not sexual in nature so youre raising moot points which is one of the trademarks of the outrage enthusiasm community.For someone who just invoked dog whistles you sure are against the idea that the sexuality of an art piece can be subjective. How can you be so sure that a specific term is a dog whistle but you put your foot down if someone with a different life amp fan experience than you is  wrong about what message a piece sends to them? This attempt to stamp out subjectivity is the weirdest part because again were talking about cultural criticism here not science.gtIn some cases sure. In this case no. Valid interpretation has a range to it. Within a certain range its open to interpretation for example is her age portrayed correctly? Does she look ? Maybe if you say so. Does she look ? Kind pushing it but plausible. Does she look ? No not really. ? No that would be a horribly drawn  year old. Basically if youre within the range of interpretation then you can fairly say sure maybe so. But outside that range of reasonable interpretation no you cant claim that your stance is justifiable. If you insist that she looks to be  years old then no I do not have to treat your view as a respectworthy opinion you are just a random crazy person.Where is the idea that she has to look  coming from? The idea is that she looks older than the character is supposed to be. If your certified objective reasonable age interpretation range  to  then thats already a thing worth talking about if only from an artistic ability standpoint. Tying it into a cultural about how comics draw women should be a small point if only people didnt get all weirded out as if the mere implication is a dog whistle that everyones a pedophile.,comicbooks,d9kgrm3,1,t5_2qhon
9505395,0,t1_d9kowaj,gt I think this would have more weight but as you acknowledge were talking about J. Scott Campbell who has a reputation for really only having one very narrow styleWhich I think is the real issue here. The people who are upset here dont rationally think that theres anything sexual about the cover itself theyre just projecting sexuality onto it because of their preconcieved biases against J Scott Campbell based on his prior work. The fact that several other artists drew her in the same scandalous outfit and in no less sexual poses earned little to no outrage is a pretty clear sign that something other than those elements is what set them off. It was less about what about this cover bothers me and more what vector can we use to make an argument against J Scott Campbell that seems lightly less petty than the usual?gtI would argue the pose and clothes and the context of J. Scott Campbell make it more than this is sexualized because shes a developed teen.And again Campbell did not pick the clothes those are not his responsibility and even so they are entirely age appropriate for a  year old in the st century. The pose has nothing sexual about it its a pose of dominance not sexuality. Again anyone who looks at that pose and thinks sex that is in their mind not on the page. He cant be held responsible for your dirty thoughts.gtthe biggest thing is that Marvel didnt pause before or after getting a renowned cheesecake artist to draw a cover for a book starring a kid. Why should they have?gtI think you only need to look at female superhero costume design in the s to show that cheesecake is the defaultYou do realize that if Riri were a real person she would not have been ALIVE during the s? I think the statute of limitations for complaining about how comics were in the s is long since passed. If youre going to complain about comics talk about how comics ARE not how they once were. gtBecause again no male character has ever had a costume like Star Sapphire or Starfire or Witchblade. So. Most men dont wear Daisy Dukes and tube tops either. Real human women tend to wear less clothing than real human men so it stands to reason that female superhero costumes would show more skin on average than male ones. Real human women also wear more skintight clothing like yoga pants leggings etc. than men do so again its reasonable that female characters would wear tight clothing. And if were going to complain about how female characters costumes are too skimpy . . .A  B  C  D  Edoes that mean were going to see some equal opportunity soon?Except you know.and as for posing yes it does look silly when you pose a man in a feminine way. Because its a feminine way. And its a man. Men look silly when they pose like women. Theres no point to be proved by doing so. gtBut thats because you could point to objective indicators like did The Office kill anyone? No? Then its not a reasonable position. But that is itself subjective. Youre making the subjective judgement that lives lost is more important than Dwight Schrutes antics. Not I would subjectively agree with you but there is no objective standard there. more lives lost is not objectively worse its just something most people would subjectively agree with.gtdid a cheesecake artist draw it?Completely irrelevant. The artists prior work has no impact on the current one. The work can only be judged on its own merits not on prior bias of the artist who produced it.gtHave comics ever done things like this before?Again irrelevant. gtIf you picked a random nonreader what age would they ascribe to this person?And that also is subjective and assuming that the answer would go your way. My belief is that if you did pick a random nonreader and told them that this was a  year old girl they would say ok and move on with their day. It might not be their first guess out of the blue but it would not be an unreasonable one and picking the exact age of teenagers is tricky which is why Mila Kunis was able to pass for  when she was only  and dozens of actors have been able to pass for  when they were over . If anyone is to blame for not having a precise view of what a teenager looks like its not comics. ,comicbooks,d9kqqk6,1,t5_2qhon

At a young age he lost both of his parents in a car accident. After six years in an orphanage Clint and his brother Barney ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Travelling Wonders. Clint soon caught the eye of the Swordsman who took the young boy on as his assistant. Along with the help of Trick Shot the Swordsman trained Clint to become a master archer. Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities Clint was beaten and left for dead allowing the Swordsman to escape town. Clints relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.gtClint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction a master archer called Hawkeye otherwise known as The Worlds Greatest Marksman. He spent some time as a member of Tiboldts Circus before joining the Coney Island Circus. He witnessed Iron Man in action and was inspired to become a costumed hero. However after a misunderstanding on his first outing Hawkeye was accused of theft and believed to be a criminal. On the run the naive Hawkeye met the Black Widow a spy for the Soviet Union with whom he fell in love. Blindly following the Black Widow Hawkeye aided her attempts to steal technology developed by Tony Stark. In one of their battles with Iron Man the Black Widow was seriously injured. Hawkeye rescued her and fled the battle to save her life. But before Hawkeye could take her to a hospital the Black Widow disappeared.

9656964,0,t3_5db7zv,Wow this is such a terrific list.  I know about the first two sections specifically and lots of these are in our household.  Amongst the favorites are the Zita Hilda the Oz books really great stuff.Ive noticed that these do not contain any Big Two superhero comics for mostly good reason in my opinion but if you find yourself looking for a nonthreatening introduction to some iconic characters that your little comic fan is sure to come across via school and friends weve had good luck with the Tiny Titans trade paperbacks and then later on Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers and the Unleashed miniseries as well.   Some of the Mighty Marvel Chapter Book series which are technically not graphic novels do have some comic art illustrations are an easy read and are wellsized to fit in little hands.  Anyway Im not suggesting an addition to the list just offering these up to others reading the thread.Looking forward to the coming years for the last two sections!

Its application has always been in a controlled environment in what I assume are high concentrations so maybe BB gambled that diluting it in the atmosphere would be okay. I see similarities with Cyclops gambling that the Phoenix Force could be controlled when it came to earth in AvX. Both origin stories for new mutants and new Inhumans can both be interesting. Youre an average teenager and one day boom your XGene goes off and your life is changed forever. Youre an Inhuman and youve been told your entire life that you can be something greater if you choose. You take that leap of faith to discover who you really are sometimes it works out sometimes it doesnt. Youre a Nuhuman young or old and one day after being exposed to this cloud you discover youre not who you think you are. I think they all have great story potential.

I dont really think Cyclops was ever a villain or ever nearly as bad as people made him.He was definitely a prick but tons of characters in Marvel are actually pretty big pricks when you break them down.Cyclops was only ever a villain because we had it hammered into dialogue CONSTANTLY. His shortcomings to his team or his friends are nothing that you couldnt compare directly to other Marvel leaders in fact I think others have had more heinous behavior in the last decade and a half or so.Cyclops was only villainous because we were told he was a villain by the rhetoric his friends and teammates were written to spout for the last few years.His behavior since MDay was really pretty mild considering the situation mutant kind was facing with Scott as its leader.I personally think Carol has acted more villainous in CW and Tony was far more of a heel in CW than Scott has been in most of the Fall of Cyclops storylines.,comicbooks,daft8eq,7,t5_2qhon

9896716,0,t3_5gyidp,I think before Planetary you should read Elliss Stormwatch. During his run Ellis turned Stormwatch from a shitty s action EXTREME comic partly into a prototype for what the s widescreen action comics will be and partly into an archaeology of the secret history of a fictional universe using it sometimes to make political points. He then broke these two elements into The Authority widescreen action and Planetary hidden archaeology. And while they have clearly superior art and are a more refined and confident embodiment of each type of story I think that the two tastes go very well together especially when mixed into the paranoia thriller aspect of Stormwatch. And if anything parts of that universes mythology come from that series.Aside from Ellis stuff if you want more comics in the vein of Transmetropolitan scifi politics comic Id say that DMZmore drama not that funny much politics Prez very funny so politics and Zombo are good fits.

The Invisibles is one of my favourite creations ever not just my favourite graphic novel just pieces of work in general. Although I will warn you its a head fuck. In a similar vein Arkham Asylum is amazing though nothing like his later Batman work. Doom Patrol is weird brilliance.If you want pure Superhero greatness I would recommend his later Batman run All Star Superman one of my favourite books of his JLA and the whole Final Crisis saga is just brilliant.

9999451,0,t1_dbaxqgk,Thats an extremely uncharitable and in a couple respects outright wrong characterization of the Inhumans. The slaves you refer to are the Alpha Primitives who are a distinct race of clones specifically bred for labor thousands of years ago. The current Inhuman Royal Family has tried to free them but the inhumane breeding experiment millennia ago have rendered them incapable of selfsustenance. They literally just kept mindlessly doing their assigned tasks regardless. Even so the creation of new Alpha Primitives has been strictly forbidden. Karnak and Gorgon were even punished for suggesting that they should be reenslaved.Calling them intergalactic conquerors isnt accurate either. They didnt conquer the Kree Black Bolt was the legitimate ruler. And they didnt start the war with the Shiar Vulcan did. Im not aware of any instance of them conquering anybody.As far as eugenics and the allegations of genocide did the XMen practice eugenics when they restarted the mutant race in AvX? Did that count as attempted genocide? If not whats the difference? As far as I can see the only distinction is that the XMen were fully aware there was a chance the Phoenix would wipe out the entire human population while the Inhumans didnt know that the Terrigen would kill mutants. Oh and also this the XMen actively tried to stop the Avengers which included some of their fellow mutants from preventing a Dark Phoenix extinction event while the Inhumans have a group thats full time job is traveling in the path of the the Terrigen cloud to prevent mutants from dying due to their mistake.Im not saying the Inhumans have no culpability here. Im just saying that the XMen have specifically demonstrated that they would do just as bad and risk even worse. The XMen fought a war against the Avengers so they could continue to get their powers and now they have started a secret unprovoked offensive against the Inhumans to prevent the Inhumans from doing the same. They explicitly say that moving offworld is an option. And they do not dismiss it for logistical reasons they dismiss it because they dont want to. They justify their war by saying that future generations of Inhumans not getting the ability to fly is no real loss paraphrasing Logan but they intentionally risked global extinction so mutants could continue to get their own wings as it were. And let us not forget that we dont know that this war was actually inevitable because the XMen intentionally forewent any attempts at peaceful negotiation. The Inhumans did not know that the entire Earth was about to become uninhabitable for mutants because the XMen didnt bother to tell them before they launched a preemptive strike.You can believe that the Inhumans are assholes all you want. But you best understand that the XMen are objectively at least as bad and arguably even  worse.,comicbooks,dbaygq5,1,t5_2qhon

So I just went and started getting a few here or there to find something I liked.  Was difficult then I saw Ms. Marvel with Kamala was coming out and it intrigued me.  Lucked up and it turned out to be a bad ass comic too.  I always liked Harley so I started picking up hers too and it snowballed from there.

Fury and his crew could try and take over  SHIELD thinking they could do a better job than whoever is in charge now.

10296277,0,t1_dcb3iyv,I think that this attack on white men angle is blown out of proportion. Some people certainly feel that way but I dont think its the majority of the pushback. Most of the people pushing back just dont factor race into their decisions at all. A lot of the people opposed to Sam as Cap for example are the same people that opposed Bucky as Cap or Dick as Batman or in some cases even Wally or Kyle. Readers have their own favorite characters and when an existing character is sidelined to allow someone else to take that role that decision really needs to be justified. If the justification appears to be the character wasnt brown enough before then that just seems like an offensive justification for making that change. I think that legacy characters are a good thing but people are missing the core trait of successful legacy characters you bring out the legacy option when the original is already defunct. Thats how it works. When the original version has been completely out of print for  years or at the very least has had pathetic sales for so long with no signs of improving then sure shake things up make a change bring in fresh blood and if youre going to do that sure why not pick a diverse character to fill that role? But the point is that you swap in the new version when the old is clearly not working anymore not just because you want more diversity. I mean compare that to Captain America which was holding a very respectable K sales for years leading up to Sam taking over and post Sam taking over outside of  spikes seems to level off at K. ,comicbooks,dcb50dh,9,t5_2qhon

I think the push for diversity will pay off in the future when kids out there look at the pages of Marvel books and see faces that look like their own. The inspiration derived from this experience will break the cycle of isolation and feelings of otherness. Nothing but good can come of this. I can attest to this from personal experience.  However with all of that said what I really want from a comic book is good story paired with good art.

This along with the pseudoretro setting really makes this series timeless. Compare this to all the s cartoons that feel very s. Im glad there were shows like Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures that gave WB an outlet for more contemporary humor and references.This show isnt perfect. There are quite a few episodes that are pretty bland if not total stinkers. But all the decent good and fantastic episodes more than make up for this whether theyre dark like Heart of Ice or BabyDoll extremely dark like Over the Edge or silly fun like Holiday Knights Girls Night Out or Jokers Millions.The Superman cartoon and the later Justice League and Batman Beyond built off everything learned from BTAS and its a damn shame that shared universe had to come to an end.,comicbooks,dcfg9d7,35,t5_2qhon

10361417,0,t3_5odn1k,Its a comprehensive list its my personal list and I have read every single title mentioned.Second at the end Ill give you three titles to not overwhelm you at the start itself.Now that thats done I have two categories. In continuity and alternate universes. Origins  Now there are usually threefour books recommended for it but my favourite has to be Superman  Birthright. If I could read just one origin story Id read this. It encapsulates almost everything I love about Clark and I reread it recently and appreciated it even further.In continuity  Superman  Up up and away  This story is written by Kurt Buseik and Johns. It majorly shows Superman having no powers and shows why Superman is still Super powers or no. Superman  Last Son  This storys written by Johns. Im sure you must have heard his name. Its an incredibly heartfelt story of Clark and Lois adopting a child. This was a child BEFORE Jon was even created. It has a lot of great moments and you see Luthor Bizarro Zod and Parasite in this story as well. The newest trade contains Superman  Brainiac as well and that story is as amazing as this one. Theyre just classic stories of bad guys and Ill always suggest this trade. Superman and the Legion of Superheroes  Now this trade is a bit different. It doesnt feature any classic villains but it shows why Superman is the superhero. This features the greatest legacy Superman leaves behind. You really need to check it out. Superman  Lois and Clark  This is a Road to Rebirth title. Clark and Lois have a son and are somehow trapped in the N continuity. Great read. Check it out. Also features Superman with a beard! Superman  Rebirth  Since I dont recommend N stories Rebirth is the perfect jumping on point. The first arc is fantastic and the second is filled with little bits of love letters. Its going on so you can jump right in.Out of countinuityalternate realities  AllStar Superman  This is my second favourite Superman story. It features the man of steel being the Man of Steel. This story can basically make anyone fall in love with Superman. But then there are a few things that may require you to have some more knowledge on Superman so I wont recommend you read it right away. Read a bit more Superman and youre good to go. This is IMO Grant Morrisons best work. Kingdom Come  Same writer as Superman  Birthright. For this I recommend you have some knowledge about the DCU. You can understand the story without it as well but youll appreciate it much much more if you know the characters better. This is my favourite Superman story. Period. Superman  Red Son  Another classic which features Supermans ship landing in Ukraine instead of Kansas. Incredible story. Incredible ending. Superman  American Alien  Now this is my second recommended Origin story. It shows a very very human Clark and its a lot more of a... Coming of age story for him. Great story. Superman For All Seasons  Lastly this book is written by the same guy behind Batman  The Long Halloween but is as human a story as American Alien. It used to be canon but tha changed later. It shows four seasons i Supes life and a different narrator for each one.,comicbooks,dcij07y,7,t5_2qhon

Theres hardly any of them and theyre basically never part of mainstream feminist discourse. Usually they stick to their own little blogs would normally never reach a mainstream audience.The reason you hear about them is because misogynist right wing groups go searching for quotes to broadcast as a way to discredit feminism. And a lot of the time its not even their quotes its out of context or sarcastic quotes from actual feminists or from misogynists trolls pretending to be feminists that they assume are real.,comicbooks,dcxms89,0,t5_2qhon
10495882,0,t3_5qa0l9,Hey guysso Ive been an avid Marvel fan for years and been reading comics for the past . Ive been trying to get into DC for a few months as Im not too happy about the direction Marvels been going and DC is doing pretty much the opposite of them also my DC knowledge is minimal and I dont like that. I tried to find some books of characters I like Flash Wonder Woman etc but they were all sold out so I have yet to delve into anything DC other than reading the first issue of Justice League Rebirth.What are the best series out right now and are the Flash and Wonder Woman titles worth checking out? Id also love recommendations for you guys favorite DC story arcsevents over the years that Ive missedThanks,comicbooks,dcxthcw,1,t5_2qhon
10497995,0,t1_dcy0zte,Most everyone reading superhero comics especially at this point understands that change is transient and that despite the latest claims of nothing will ever be the same! things will eventually revert to something resembling the status quo. But take for example Grant Morrisons New XMen some of the things he had done at the end of his run were almost immediately undone. That doesnt affect my enjoyment of his work in the slightest.The whole idea of a shared universe also allows for some interesting character development. Sure more often than not you have characters who behave completely different depending on whos writing them. But occasionally you get a character who follows an interesting natural character arc as they go from writer to writer that you wouldnt have seen otherwise. Daredevil and Cyclops are probably my favorite examples of this.,comicbooks,dcy23xz,7,t5_2qhon

10522647,0,t3_5qnuu2,Ugh. As someone who grew up reading comics when they were  to  cents apiece and the occasional doublesized issue here and there which would cost as much as a dollar my mind reels at the notion of a comic costing that much even if it is  pages. Ill happily pay  for a full graphic novel or trade paperback but somehow dropping a Hamilton on a single issue just seems crazy. Also this just feels like more evidence of Marvel and DC for that matter overlooking their younger readers in favor of the adults with more disposable income. I dont get how Disney and Warner Bros seem to believe that TV cartoons toys and movie franchises translate into dedicated comics readers. Pricing out the kids strikes me as longterm suicide for the comics themselves. old man rant,comicbooks,dd0utcq,41,t5_2qhon

10744595,0,t1_ddo5dz0,Well Ive long played and now am a freelance writer for the Shadowrun tabletop RPG. Native Americans have a unique role in the history and overall setting and in particular to the contemporary setting there are existing and potential story ideas already that implicate or integrate various Native American beliefs myths practices and potential in the Gibsonesque Matrix computer network that has replaced the Internet in the setting. Identity and spirituality and even reality can be investigated in how a Native hacker would approach and integrate cybernetic and other physical augmentations as well as how they might operate in the virtual reality Matrix where AI and other individuals could adopt various identities that could even be the real beings such as the voudoun LoaAI in Gibsons novels. Theres further room for exploration into specific ideas such as the twospirits individuals and manifestations in the real world and virtual world as aspects of individual identity dualmultiple manifestations or even as manifestations of independent or gestalt identity.And this doesnt even get to the action itself where you get to play with cybered commandos and mystical adepts and spellslinging magicians and hackersriggers controlling small drone armadas.

I find myself wondering why it even exist especially when the retailer commentary is far more interesting than the click bait. One store reported seeing an increase in sales for xmen  back issues.

10871871,0,t3_5vdo6y,Probably far from the best but it was a change that couldve had potential perhaps...Mr. Freeze was revamped in Underworld Unleashed in  GL tiein issues. Instead of being locked up in an armored suit his physiology was changed so he could exist outside the suit and his cold powers were now internalized like Killer Frost and what New  did with Captain Cold for a while. Barely a month later over in BATMAN hes back in the armor a much more amped up version of it similar to what Arnold was wearing in Batman amp Robin and its business as usual. I get why they did this  so Freeze had the same look as he would in the next big Batman movie  but I never liked it. Changing him as dramatically as others were during UU wouldve been nice to see.Plus he never seemed to thrive as a character like his animated version did. Its like DC tried to equal the BTAS success but it fell flat. Even Dinis attempt to redo his comics origin with a similar origin to Heart of Ice wasnt a home run.

It was quite a mess. Rather than fix it they decided it was easier and more acceptable to just toss it all and start over with a big event leading to a reboot.  As an added bonus Superman and others get depowered as Silver age powers are super OP and no one can write good stories anymore. No more moving planets between galaxies no more super hypnosis and no more nighinvulnerability.At the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths SuperboyPrime who had helped stop the AntiMonitor entered a Paradise Dimension with golden age Earth  Superman and Lois and Earth  Alexander Luthor. These characters survived the reboot that CoIE lead into.Fast forward  years. Infinite Crisis. The paradise dimension opens up and out comes SuperboyPrime. Hes gone a little bonkers.

Its fairly close to the movie but thats to be expected since they are both adapted from the same source.I dont know of any other screenplays that first became comics though there are plenty of comic adaptions of movies that often use the screenplay as a source and so show things that were written but not in the movie.

On the other hand parents quickly learn that not everything is an emergency and can tune out cries that arent particularly urgent.

Whether DC allows them to grow to adults or retcons them back to teens or somewhere in between the legion stands as the best teen book of all time for me. For a long time they were pretty relegated to their own corner of the DCU so writers didnt feel the need to keep the status quo with them. They could grow and adapt. Characters could lose arms get married die become transgender anything. Reading the Legion retcon after Zero hour is what got me into Legion and made me a lifelong Legionnaire. The Great Darkness Saga is still one of the best DC stories not just Legion stories ever and Legion Lost the  miniseries not the  ongoing is so heartbreaking it makes me cry every time.Great comics great characters!

However after that he became a genuinely unhinged threat who travelled the multiverse and became one of the most interesting meta villains.  He became far less about punching the walls of reality and more of a really tragic character who is almost justified in how completely robbed of his destiny he was.  Give his wiki a read through and youll see that some actually interesting things happened with him.  But not just that think of the potential of it being him.  When Superboy Prime first truly fell from grace it was when he confronted Connor for stealing his rightful place as Superboy.  He felt he wasted his potential that should have been his.  Now if Prime came back hed find that Superman got his happily ever after and now has a son whos Superboy.  It would drive him nuts.  Add in the fact that Prime is a true multiversal threat whos stronger than Superman and has even killed a Superman before then you can maybe see why people are excited.,comicbooks,deda2b9,37,t5_2qhon

OneTwoEdit curiously enough I was watching some Variant videos on YT last night and its mentioned that drowning has been hinted at as a way to kill Logan. Not sure if thats in reference to the Uncanny XForce pages I linked above though.

11209764,0,t1_df2kpmj,IMHO I think black just would look good on the cover and I feel like the rating would be common enough that aesthetics are an important consideration. Maybe instead of orange though we could have green or blue? For the covers with a similar color to that of the seallogowhatever I was thinking we could have a triangle in the bottom corner like the shape produced when dogearing a page thats white or some other contrasting color to set off the color of the logo.The problem I see with the whole system though is the same as with the MPAA. In movies getting a rating of NC is getting the kiss of death. A lot of times when a studio is contractually forced to release a movie they dont want to maybe because it could compete with another movie they want to do well theyll make sure it gets NC since they know that that means no one will advertise it and very few theaters will play it. How do you think these problems could be avoided?,comicbooks,df2m455,1,t5_2qhon
11210432,0,t1_df2o0jl,In the most literal sense sure. I assume Blue will even outsell Generation X which is largely but not entirely cult characters. Partly but not entirely because of reality that chucking the label of XMen or flagship on a book makes it sell these days more than most things. Though weirdly that last incarnation of Uncanny which was excellent would maybe have sold better as XForce.But they get a huge amount of push from events and high profile creators and sell less well than Uncanny and Extraordinary right now and the rest of the line back in the Bendis era. I think a pretty ordinary proper XMen book would outsell it like the last few eras of adjectiveless or Astonishing.Being stuck with really quite old characters in order to sell is quite a bad place to be in for the XMen creatively because once nostalgia runs out you have to have something left. This is as much an issue for the new Gold as Blue though Im looking forward to Guggenheims attempt at going full Whedon more than most.I think youll agree that developing the Xverse to keep it interesting fresh and good And grounded in its core themes is better than the alternative. Things like going back to the Xavier school an entirely Morrisonian idea and the  era teams of core Claremont and XFactor right before Claremont reenergised XMen for the late s. Im optimistic the new line might actually do both  get the initial sales from nostalgia but do good enough runs and change enough stuff to be reasonably good and retain sales.

11233205,0,t3_609p30,This is going to be a bit of an essay so strap in.Alright so first I dont think the XMen as a franchise is necessarily broken or even really that bad. You wanna see bad XMen comics come visit me in the years . I havent even begun the Chuck Austen run which is legendarily bad.  But I dont know if Id call the current state of the XMen franchise especially great either.  Its kind of... just OK. I dont hate reading any of the XBooks but neither do any of them light me on fire apart from the Wolverine books  for our purposes lets consider them excluded from this discussion.So to talk about how to fix the XMen we need to talk about what the problems are. I think it stems from three main problems Stale characters. Stale stories. Stale creative teams.These three problems are interrelated and prop each other up forming a table of comics that are content to be just ok.Stale CharactersThe XMen as a franchise has a very deep roster with a lot of compelling characters and more than a few duds but whatever. So why do we have a fairly static roster reboot after reboot? The books are frequently dominated by a handful of characters with one or two characters being in nearly every concurrent book. Its to the point that major franchise crossing events are required to make any room for anyone else. And when one overexposed character leaves the scene instead of digging into the deep roster they just repeat the mistake with another character or two which dilutes the flavor of those books.Moreover Old Man Logan is the most recent wave of this which is a double or triple mistake. While OML solo book is excellent he doesnt really fit in a team environment without ignoring significant parts of the character without giving the team book the space to tell the story of how he overcomes his rejection of society  which they havent. Its also just repeating one of the problems with OG Wolverine that they solved by killing him.Stale StoriesThe frequent reboots also frequently mean that any momentum that the books may have been building is wiped out and a new or old creative team steps in and treads a lot of the same ground as if it was new.  I dont dislike the O but I do dislike how theyve been handled  they arent allowed to get past the face your doomed future story. Its an important story and the first one that needs to get told but by the time anyone gets close to resolving it its time for a disruptive crossover event and a new creative team. Also while the threat of extinction thing is an important thematic component to the XMen at the crux of evolution and discrimination I have to agree with a lot of people that theyve been beating that drum at the same volume for too long. Moreover they never really brought it to a relateable level. Oh no! Some Clister died of Mpox? It doesnt exactly raise the stakes or make the threat real. At some point it just becomes noise.Stale CreativeI mean no disrespect to the current crop of writers and artists and possibly editorial on the Xbooks but this is part of the problem too. A surprising number of recent Xbook writers excel at solo books but seem to struggle when balancing a team book. Moreover Marvel seems to like to have writers on the XMen who are also writing six other books and stretching the writer so thin often shows. Even if they had the best intentions and a revolutionary vision for the franchise they wouldnt be able to focus on it.  I really liked the postschism arrangement for example  it was conceptually clear and well motivated and made for interesting drama but Bendis was writing too damn many books at the time and it was clear he was writing mostly to meet deadline than to service his admittedly really interesting ideas.  And not to beat a dead horse but the constant disruptive events have the effect of stifling progress on even interesting runs.And the art roster while often filled with capable and talented artists is often filled with the same artists over and over. I dont particularly dislike Greg Land or Terry Dodson but Ive seen them on XMen. Id be ok if they moved on to other things.Great but what do we do to fix it?Of course this is the harder part but Ill try to focus it on addressing the problems as Ive outlined them. New blood on the creative side and let them focus on their project. Theres a lot fertile soil for great stories in the Xfranchise books lets give a writer and artist some room to run and build something. Lets let them get past the first obvious stories and build the characters out a little bit. Id like to pick up an Xbook and be surprised by it in some capacity. This is the biggest thing. Also considering that one of the primary XMen themes is the racismdiscrimination thing maybe we could get some writers who can bring personal experience to their work. I feel like the straight white dudes complaint is especially relevant for XMen. Quit trying to make the XMen play nice with other franchises in huge events. Firstly theyre disruptive and smothering the Xbooks among others. Secondly the XMen as a franchise dont benefit from these events at all  they just take characters off the board in both casualties and gimmicky crossover teams.  Im not totally against events and I understand why IvX was necessary but Id like the next event or two that involve the XMen to be Xbooks only for a round or two.  Theyve resolved all the XMen inclusive linewide plots so lets give the franchise some time to rebuild. Dig a little deeper into the roster. There are a lot of characters who are stomping around at the edges who are interesting and could flourish with some attention. Some characters are ready to graduate from the Breakfast Club  Rockslide was pretty decent in Amazing a couple years back and Anole is a pretty solid earnest and eager character. Theyre almost always great when they get some pages. They dont necessarily need to be at the forefront of heavy drama but they could easily be main roster characters. And theyre not alone. As much as I really love the misfit teams some characters feel undeservedly stuck there. At the very least it will help with the sameold sameold problem. Dial it back a little for a while. Everything has been turned up to eleven for so long everything has been so big and so loud for so long Ive forgotten what quiet sounds like. Remember when there used to be Thanksgiving dinner episodes or even just a scene where theyre having a beach day before everything goes to hell. I dont remember the last issue of XMen where characters were given enough time to so much as catch their breath.  Moreover XMen has more themes than imminent global existential threat. Lets dig into something else for a while.So basically tldr You dont get something different by doing the same thing over and over.I do like the current idea about how the XBooks are organized one book for the dark violent XForcey stuff one book for the big spectacular adventure stuff one for a younger team of students and one experimental or offbeat team.  Those seem to be the major four modes of XMen books and its good to see them all represented.,comicbooks,df59oha,8,t5_2qhon

11239972,0,t1_df4tt1b,I think revolutionary Cyclops just makes so much sense as a natural progression for that charecter.He had a terrible life and all that kept him going were those rules and Xaviors dream.Slowly but surely all that got erroded. All those rules of society start making less and less sense as you see the same crimes against mutant happen over and over. He just kept getting screwed over for following those rules and believing in them.And Xaviors dream kept getting undermined by the man being a total monster but also by the fact that Charels dream just doesnt work things just got worse for mutants not better.So AvX comes along and the only thing I do buy about that story is where Cyclopse goes in it. In fact I still really like AvX almost  just because of the Cyclopse stuff. Even if nothing else makes sense.,comicbooks,df61963,1,t5_2qhon

11256948,0,t1_df7wrp1,As someone embroiled in this conversation youre missing the core concept behind this conversation. Your assumption that people want Danny to be Asian because his story involves him enveloping himself in Asian culture is incorrect. The difference is nuanced but hugely significant. Youre approaching the issue from the wrong direction.The point of view starts with this that Danny being everything that he is becoming what he is through the means that he does is racist. Thats the core issue. Thats the beginning and end of the problem.Ideas like making Danny Asian and a half dozen other ideas that range from equally racist to better than just Asian Danny are all proposed solutions or opportunities stemming from the problem. Obviously theres plenty of reason to discuss argue etc about these proposed solutions but to even begin to find common ground the core issue maintains the most important aspect. And frankly the least surprising but most frustrating thing is that folk refuse to acknowledge that core issue through attacking proposed solutions.This thing happening? The artists all creating Asian Iron Fists? This is first and foremost an acknowledgement by people who matter in recognizing the core issue. Voicing support and acknowledging the issue is the absolutely best thing people can do right now because what would the point  be of creating a solution if people dont recognize and respect the issue at its heart in the first place?,comicbooks,df7yi2e,-7,t5_2qhon

Also Flash couldve been a hero without the symbiote as soon as he was given prosthetic legs. Just look at that Space Knight issue where he went to the volcano planet in an exosuit without the symbiote. The symbiote was his legs in the beginning and an allegory to his alcoholism. Hes in a better place now and doesnt need the symbiote anymore. It was time for him to move on and for the symbiote to get a new host.

11298239,0,t1_dfclsj2,Youre right to mention the importance of preorders. But how do you expect retailers to know what to order without companies telling them whats going to be published? Thats what solicitations are. So that means the next chapter of a story or the next spin off book will be solicited before the previous chapter is published. There is no way around that in the current system. And yes fans read them too but thats not really why they exist. Does it suck when stories are spoiled by solicitations? Sure. But thats the risk you run when you read solicitations. And yes it also sucks when books run late. But saying that Marvel is struggling because of solicitations is just wrong. I also take a bit of umbrage with your opening statementgtIts no secret that Marvel Comics is in a losing battle with their rival DC Comics. The current era of Marvel is riddled with excess and poor judgment. Theyre struggling to maintain a large portion of their readers. Along with event overkill fleeing talent and constant rebooting are solicitations hurting Marvel Comics as well?Marvel is in a losing battle? If you look at the estimates of what comic book shops are ordering Marvel comics is still the top publisher in terms of unit and dollar share month after month. They are consistently selling more product than they did last year. There were I think three months when DC took top sot when Rebirth launched but with the exception of that Marvel has been the top publisher since the New  heat cooled. I dont say that as a fan its just a fact. If that means Marvel is in a losing battle Im sure theyd be happy to be losing every month of the year. ,comicbooks,dfcmzqd,10,t5_2qhon

The big iconic Avengers were mostly created in the s and back and reflect the marketing realities of those times.  There has been a lot of diversity in Marvel comics from the s until now.Though a lot of the people who read the comics also watch the movies the reverse is not true which is why there is so much misinformation about a lack of diversity in comics being slung about.Marvel could easily do a movie about any one of the vast array of nonwhitemale characters in their universe.  They could put in one of the nonwhitemale characters that have been part of the Avengers.  Theres no need for them to create a moviesonly character unless there would be a distinct benefit in doing so.  There isnt with such a huge array of existing characters that could easily be used.  ,comicbooks,dfeeuls,-13,t5_2qhon

In time you will help them accomplish wonders.That is inspiration at its core.The film was all character development and is a more accurate rendering of what Superman existing on Earth would be like. His atmosphere the look and build of Superman Rebirth and sheen all resonate with Cavills Superman. He is an inspiration triumphing the odds when there was angst and doubt put on him and he prevailed.In Superman Action Comic  Superman partnered up with Lex Luthor his RIVAL back on Earth in our dimension and defeated an astral juggernaut duo after losing his powers and feeling unsure of himself.That sounds about the same when Cavill had to fight Zod without knowing how he would overcome him yet he did even with doubt. ,comicbooks,dfpxn8s,-1,t5_2qhon

So even though his hunch was right he was willing to gamble all lives on Earth for that hunch. I can agree that Captain America did come fully loaded for a fight but Cyclops made no honest attempt to deescalate when Cap made an attempt to peacefully approach. In other words Cyclops often cares more about what he thinks is right in stead of what he thinks is best.

Is the narrative primarily in st person rd or expository dialogue? etc etc.Im all for dumb plots but when you have to talk about them as if they are the selling point for your book then thats a bad sign for what the book holds if its a good book then the dumb plot will just be a bonus dont hammer that point home but if its bad then well you talking so much about how its so positive and fun will just seem like super damage control.,comicbooks,dg98i3k,6,t5_2qhon

11624504,0,t3_65tdzf,It wasnt the wanting ownership and creative control that made them assholes it was the fact that a bunch of them acted like assholes. While being unrealistic for people working at Marvel it is totally fine to want to be able to own your characters and make the comics you want to make without too much interference. And they deserve all the kudos they get for being able to do that. That doesnt mean they werent assholes though. My understanding was that Liefeld was notorious for disrespecting collaborators McFarlane frequently insulted fans Lee and Liefeld regularly blew deadlines and changed things on the fly without consulting anybody. And when they left Marvel some of them withheld work leaving editors and other creators in a lurch with big holes to fill. And once they got Image off and running things ran very poorly with tons of announced books being massively delayed or never produced and abrupt cancellations. ,comicbooks,dgdndrj,5,t5_2qhon

11727275,1,t1_dgpamq6,Beyond outright mind control such as Maxwell Lord the Milton Fine version of Brainiac Eradicator or Eclipso when has Superman gone bad?  All of those were overt attempts at mind control not an attempt to change Supermans character.Also Batman never actually used those tools but planning for The Worst has been part of his character since he became the black amp grey Batman following Knightfall.  And became further justified in the setup in Identity Crisis.When Captain America became Nomad that is messing with a core character.  Ill even concede that whatever the hell Nick Fury whispered to Thor is messing with a core character.  These are when characters are reacting to situations thrust upon them.  You can see their progression and adaptation to circumstance.  Not being molded into something to fit some writers narrative.However this is just hamfisted generally like all CosmicCube alterreality stories are.  For lazy writers that know its the only way to get at least half the people on board for this sort of thing.

11745413,0,t3_67kagd,Thats a loaded question. In my opinion the best villains are either the ones that are hard to call villains the ones you sympathize with and almost want to see win and the ones who are just straight up brutal in every way to the point where you actually despise them and want the hero to just kick their ass. My best examples of each areMagneto. Hes not even really a villain when I think about it but hes so often labeled as one. His cause is sympathetic and as time goes on you cant help but think that hes definitely in the right. It becomes harder and harder to justify and side with Xaviers classic vision of mutanthuman peace when there are literal death robots built to kill their species. And Norman Osborn. Osborn is the most ambitious persistent and downright evil people in comic book history if you ask me. His hatred runs so deep for SpiderMan that its psychotic. From not only killing SpiderMans girlfriend and also later revealed to have slept with her and had children with her as well as the damage hes caused to his own family and how far hes willing to go for power and control Dark Reign in  and Ultimate  in the Ultimate Universe the dude just reeks of crazy. His real superpower is perseverance. He never quits. He always manages to come back and fuck shit up worse than he did before. Hes twisted on a whole new level. You just want the dude to go away forever because you hate him so much. ,comicbooks,dgrdeuy,9,t5_2qhon

People hate these status quo change ups because we all know itll eventually just revert back. I have basically no idea what comic fan even wants to see Eddie as venom.
