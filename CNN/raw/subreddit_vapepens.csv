The glass herb chamber is called the Bender.From left to right Persei with Okeanos Omicron shorty with KISS Globe and Nibbler GN Glass Necklace Persei with Hercules SR and Nibbler XL  with EO Cart and Nibbler X Persei with Bender Herb Chamber Persei double top Persei shorty with KISS Globe and Nibbler G.I do believe the Hercules cartridge to be the highest performing portable oil vaporizer ever to hit the market. Id LOVE to be shown any type of comparible device Ive tried somewhere north of  oil vaporizers so far and nothing comes remotely close.Here is a video of our Hercules SR cartridge assembly. This is a user serviceable cartridge engineered for essential oils not rebranded ecig technology.  We removed the electronic cigarette type heaters thus removing any hybrid vapor temp is user controlled now  We removed the silica wick andor glass rods for a small few who think its a glass rod  We removed all the solder  We removed all wires of any kind no more nichrome  wire  We removed all silicone  We also added an option for a Nibbler XL no more drops of water to cool it down  We use only quality parts that we sourced for the Hercules  Built tough to withstand daily use  Simply put the Hercules SR series essential oil vaporizer is everything that the vapor enthusiast needs.  You can load as you go if you wish  You can have preloaded tanks or coils  You can load a gram easily  You can recover all your oil  You can boil it or submerge it in Isopropyl alcohol.You can service your own device so no more down time  Comes with a One Year Warranty against manufacturers defects including heater  A video I made of the Hercules in action at low power to savor flavor  A single rip at regular power running off batteries ,vapepens,cps3wh8,1,t5_379ot
