Faster charging isnt always a good thing it creates more heat and in the long term can deteriorate batteries much more than slow charges.I think its great to own  or maybe  high power W chargers for those times when youre midday and have been using the phone a lot so you really need to crank in some more juice in  minutes and then get on with your day. Ill probably keep my W charger in my travel bag for just such an occasion quick top ups during the days when they are needed.But generally speaking most people just charge their phones overnight and if youre going to leave it plugged in for  hours you honestly shouldnt be using an W charger because thats just charging it needlessly fast and causing unwanted heat and wear on the battery.

Relative to the p and such we are getting flagship levelupgraded CPU and ram and maybe a better build quality yet to be determined.Other than that the p already had flagship screen camera and maybe just below flagship specs for the time yet it cost  cheaper depending on options?What would have made the pixels more arguable for the price is matching storage sizes with Apple adding ip or  and maybe even throwing in SD card tray? Though unlimited Google storage may cancel out the SD card.Anyways the pixel phones dont entirely add up to the significantly increased cost.

Nothing more nothing less.  If a locked bootloader and Verizon taking care of software updates is that bothersome to you I suggest taking a walk outside once in awhile.I got mine through Verizon for the same reason as you.  Cost less and will get the phone no later then Besides to the OP and I guess others that agree with him.  Dont get me wrong I see your side of it. Back in the earlier days of Android it would have pissed me off.  But now not at all.  However why do you really care?  What gives you the right to judge others on wtf are they thinking?

9204855,0,t3_56f3i6,If you buy it through Verizon you will have a locked bootloader. This means that it is very unlikely to be able to install a custom rom and root because someone will have to figure out how to unlock it. If you have no desire to root or custom rom your phonewhich it seems you wont since you are coming from an iphone. Then the Verizon one will be fine. As far as the updates go in the past a nexus phone called the galaxy nexus was sold on Verizon. What ended up happening is that the Verizon version of that phone got extremely delayed updates compared to the unlocked version. This means that people at Verizon despite having the same phone were getting updates months after it initially came to their unlocked variant. According to what people have been saying Verizon will be in control of the updates for the phone which could mean delayed updates. It has also been said that it is possible that Google will wait for Verizon to be ready to push the update to its phone and Google and Verizon will do the update all at oncemeaning there is technically no delay. As of right now there is no guarantee that the latter will happen. If you do not want to have to worry about either things that I talked about then you can buy from the google store and still use a device payment plan if needed. If you buy from the google store it seems that some variants of will be shipping late November due to the amount of preorders. If you want the phone much quicker you will have to go through Verizon.,GooglePixel,d8is8ky,2,t5_3aobb

9223283,0,t3_56oyic,Hi!  So the camera it seems like it will be a little bit better than the  if we look at DXO rating. Really the HDR processing from Google is really really impressive. I use both Mac and PC with my phones. Honestly I find my Nexus P communicates better with my Mac than any other combo. That is including iPhone to Mac. I just plug it in and use Android File Transfer from Google for Mac. For photos I put them on Google Photos. For files I use Google Drive. For notifications and action friendly notification mirroring I use Pushbullet. It feels very nice. Just fyi I use an iMac for dev and design a desktop built by me for fun time and a Surface Book. My iMac and Android combo is my favourite. Andromeda seems to be happening over the next year or two. What it will do? Who knows. But the Pixel will probably get it. But if you want to hold back and wait to see a clearer picture of where Google is going with hardwaresoftware for phones Id wait until next year. Im from the UK so no VZ but from what I have gathered it just means it will be a harder time rooting your device. But honestly the rooting community has really died down since stock Android has become such a delight to use. The Pixel adds even more reason to love Stock with its Google overlay. It seems updates will still be handled by Google and will be pushed out the same time as everyones devices bought from Google directly. But really we do not know this until updates come out and see it first hand.But honestly the Pixel seems like a killer device Im still upset Google are not introducing instalment plans in the UK otherwise Id be joining you. The iPhone  just seems a little boring when it is competing with the Pixel. Anyway hope this helps if you do get Pixel I hope you enjoy it!,GooglePixel,d8l4ar5,27,t5_3aobb

9227716,0,t3_56m7dd,I switched to Android a couple years ago because I didnt like iOS. Got an HTC M because I like the metal unibody feel of iPhones. It was great but I also like new toys and new versions of software so I Tmobile JUMPed to a Note  figured Id give the pen a try and I wanted a fasterbetter camera than the MM. Notes fine. I dont like the glass very much barely use the pen. Missed my metal unibody. Its also too big for me for comfortable onehanded use. Was going to JUMP to HTC  but they only had the silver and it has a silver outline around the bezels which I dont like. I prefer all black around the screen. Figured Id wait for the Nexus since its always first for new software. Also liked the idea of a back finger print scanner and through my Note have realized I dont like physical buttons I only liked it because I could double click to open the camera. Found out HTC was making the new Nexus got excited. Saw Pixel launcher liked things about it. And so on. Now here we are where Google has released what is essentially what Ive always wanted An iPhone that runs pure Android with an amazing camera. I understand why some people arent into it and there are some things I dont love about it or would like added so Ill probably get the Pixel  when it comes out but basically this is exactly the phone for me.

They will start using their best sensors in their cameras and license out the previous generation to Nikon et al.Canon will not be dependent on anyone and they make excellent lenses.

Google runs the preauth to make sure you have the fundscredit for the phone. When it times out they do another one. You may see them come and go as a result. The charge wont be completed until your phone ships at which time the final charge will stick. This way they dont have a bunch of orders that cant be completed on the th while people farther behind in line have the money at hand.

9430608,0,t3_59u82n,I know it sucks.  But the best thing to do is either start uninstalling apps in this case try uninstalling inbox restart the phone and monitor your battery performance for  hrs from there if that doesnt fix it start uninstalling other apps you think could be the problem or put the phone in Safe Mode which only has the stock apps activated and try using it for a day in that.  If you notice in Safe Mode your battery drain has disappeared you can confirm it is definitely something you downloaded that has bad code and is draining your battery.  I know its a process but it works.  I have done it a couple of times myself.  Good luck.

9591152,0,t3_5cc3pp,Hmmm if I understand this correctly we no longer need a cache partition...On devices that support seamless updates Google Pixels Android basically slipstreams OTAs as it writes the updated partitions meaning that it can merge in changes without first creating copies. An advantage of this system is that it does away with the need for a dedicated cache partition. It does not exist on the new Pixel phones and isnt likely to appear on future devices supporting seamless updates.Likewise the recovery partition has become largely redundant. Historically the stock recovery image was used to install OTA packages perform factory resets and wipe the cache partition. Installing OTAs is now handled by the OS and theres no need to wipe the cache partition anymore so the recovery partition has been removed as well. Since the ability to perform factory resets is still important and the Android team still wants to allow for sideloading OTAs a functionally similar recovery feature has been integrated into the boot image.,GooglePixel,d9vb0qo,6,t5_3aobb

Im seeing a lot of people who ordered after I did receive theirs people who ordered way before me with pending statuses and no expected ship dates the whole things a giant shit show but the dude I spoke to at core said that most if not all orders should be filled by December nd at the latest so that seems to be the worst case scenario.

Ofc. in the US it would be a little less but still not that difference which would worth it brandname and a little easier buttons to push on Spigen UH nothing else. If I could make it less glossy and more matte I would say it worth it.Photos before after comparison to the noname TPU case I pulled off the protective film only after the dye process which saved the clear view of the back  only a little line got dark where the liquid could get into between the back and the film sadly right under the camera led,GooglePixel,danmhx9,3,t5_3aobb

The big empty chin on the pixel just reminds me too much that they could have done better but chose not to. Youre never annoyed when you have something you know could have been the most perfect thing ever if the company didnt cheapen out? The Pixel is competing with the S and the iPhone  and its just painful when the other two look so fully loaded with value.

10020991,0,t3_5j4097,You can try downloading your matching version factory image from Google and using fastboot flash systema system.img and fastboot flash systemb systemother.imgIf that doesnt work just do a full flash to factory reset by using the flashall.bat. IF that does not work download the Unified Toolkit and use it to flash the factory image. When I tried using flashall.bat it told me my system partition had insufficient storage and wouldnt flash. The ONLY saving grace from the same no command bootloop was a full flash with Unified Toolkit.A factory reset is not that bad on these phones if you allowed it to back stuff up from the getgo. Your home screen will restore exactly as you had it previously app icons and all. Texts and call log restored some app data again if allowed to backup to Drive when it asked during setup. It was the least painful factory reset Id ever done.

10118907,0,t1_dbqef3b,The battery life was about the same for me. Ive heard varying reports though. The guy from real reviews hes the black dude and hes pretty great says he cant use it over his S because the battery life is trash but Ive seen people around here say that it gives them around  hours or so SOT and Im sure the standby time is great since it uses doze mode even while its in your pocket. With any device though its gonna a depend on usage. You can always try it out for a week and return it. Thats what I ended up doing. The phone was admittedly rushed. Huawei was the original contractor but wanted to claim design credit and Google didnt budge on that so in the final  months they went to htc. This wouldnt be an issue but after playing with it for a week the phone does seem like it has some dead giveaways that it was rushed. The camera glare issue the audio distortion on max volume the lack of water proofing which they even admitted was because they ran out of time the lack of x MIMO even though the device has the same chipset as the S  the screen peeling issue if the phone gets too hot the lack of SD expansion etc. I just couldnt justify the price. Im hoping theyll add more features and fix all the issues so Im staying tuned or at least waiting till the price drops.    ,GooglePixel,dbqi1tl,1,t5_3aobb

10126237,0,t1_dbr9jhh,The pixel will only delay the doze mode for  minutes  while in your pocket. All the time it spends in doze does make a pretty big difference to a lot of users. People will definitely have their phones in their pockets for an hour at a time it ought only save like  percent but thats time that could be used toward SOT. I definitely recommend that everyone install force doze to enable pixel like doze mode on marshmallow devices. Theres never a reason not to. Thats more than  hours solid SOT in with about a third of a charge left. Thats including all the time I use YouTube with the screen off. Check out my standby time altogether I always get around  hours SOT and I can be in standby mode for days. Force doze made damn sure that the phone didnt drain barely anything after I fell asleep.  Without force doze theres a lot more of a chance of having wake locks and stuff which would mean that there would be no guarantee that I would wake up with as much battery life.           ,GooglePixel,dbrgdxy,0,t5_3aobb

10211088,0,t3_5m6gm2,So Google Play Services is a broad set of APIs that other apps can use to help facilitate using google products and services. So for example if an app wants to use GPS it can either . Using the AOSP LocationManager to get location or . Use the Google Play Services FusedLocationProvider services to get smarter location. If the developer does this then Google Play Services the app will be using GPS and will be reported as having a high battery impact. Which means youll say play services up there on your battery monitor but might not see the app thats actually requesting those services from play services up there on the battery monitor. That definitely sucks because it makes it a lot harder to figure out what it is thats actually using your battery but normally in this situation youve got some app thats using a bunch of services aggressively and potentially incorrectly.

10498258,0,t1_dcy2qqo,You werent given permission to take the chocolate bar which falls under the definition of theft. Intention to pay is there but permission wasnt given. Thats different in the case of your friend giving Google permission to take the phone but now he has to show that they have no intention to return it.I agree that some extra compensation should be given and think a Daydream is really fair. And I agree that your friend should be given money back if they havent returned it by this point. Im not asking you to tolerate errors. Im asking you to understand that there will be errors from time to time. Errors arent something that justify blowing things up because errors happen. Im not going to go on Facebook and ridicule my friend if they made a common mistake. And if you dont want to wait months for your preorder Google gave people the option to cancel their order. People waited because they felt waiting for the phone is more worthy than getting their money back. This is a matter of preference and thats why Google granted cancellations during that time. Expecting more compensation than cancellation is pushing it.,GooglePixel,dcy36l2,0,t5_3aobb

Seeing as the last time the app was updated was  I highly doubt we will get an update anytime soon to resolve this... I loved how simplistic this was give me the song info and save it to a history list.  That was all I needed and all I will ever want.  Maybe there is a way to contact someone to inform them?

Please have a read of this article I wrote a year or so ago which lists some troubleshooting steps.  It talks about PushBullet but the same holds true for Gmail or any other service that uses GCM.  If youre not getting notifications then you probably have a GCM connectivity issue.  We had major issues at our work a few years ago with our IPv connectivity to GCM it was QoS related it turned out.  If I ran a VPN on my phone Id get push messages when I was supposed to.
