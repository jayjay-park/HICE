1865273,0,t1_ck3cv6i,hi there...thanks for the details.i generally like incandescent or halogen temperature. no way flourescent does anyone like those?!is color temp the only difference bt halogen and LED?  is there a difference in heat emitted?we would need remodel cans.  .  any recommendations that I can buy online and also a appropriate dimmer?,Lighting,ckdykar,1,t5_2qpor
3263068,0,t3_2xhkn0,First of all your pictures are crooked.For lighting maybe you can try some strip LED lights on the ceiling to light the picture. Or some LEDs behind the TV shooting out. You can also try moving the lamps around the house.,Lighting,cp088m2,2,t5_2qpor

5723126,0,t3_3skbiu,One thing to keep in mind about replacing incandescent candelabra bulbs with LEDs is that the LED candelabra bulbs tend to emit almost no light below horizontal.  Depending on how your fixtures are oriented and what youre trying to illuminate this may or may not be a problem.  ,Lighting,cx6idzt,1,t5_2qpor
6016187,0,t1_cy7zlwa,I agree with most of this but there are a lot more factors than ceiling height when choosing a lamp. For instance if you have a ceiling fan in the room a BR lamp could add to strobe effect.  A PAR lamp mimics the lamps that you are using now the closest.  A BR could be a good choice but we dont have enough information to specify here.  They will definitely get more light on the walls and less on the floor.  Maybe you want this maybe you dont.  Also BR and PAR LED lamps are manufactured to perform in recessed cans.  Most of the lamps he found were too bright not too dim.  My advice here would be to use a brighter lamp and a dimmer but the fact is that LED lamps are perfect for recessed down lights and heat is not a concern.  Any quality LED is rated to last between    hours in a recessed environment.,Lighting,cy88ynj,2,t5_2qpor

Change them to LED but as you dont know the transformer you may have to try a few different ones. You will want to change the pendants out if you want to go LED.,Lighting,cztuyx0,1,t5_2qpor

8102208,0,t3_4q5ng5,tldr summary Replace your fittings not just the lamps with goodquality integrated LED enginesThe problem youre having is a huge issue I come up against a lot in my profession that is yourself and others included are replacing Incandescenthalogen lamps in luminaires designed for incandescenthalogen lamps with cheaplymade retrofittable LED lamps designed for the domestic market.Fundamentally you need to understand how LED works to understand what the problems are with what youre saying.  Ill begin with the humble Halogen lamp.  Approx. say K nice and warm.  As you dim the halogen lamp it cools down as it is not drawing as much heat what happens then is a reaction inside the halogen which warms the light even further down to around K as well as making it dimmer.  LED literally cannot achieve this with a simple retrofit lamp replacement as an LED lamp in itself is an array of Blue LED covered with yellow phosphors similar technology to fluorescent.   So no matter what you do youll always have the same colour temperature as you dim it.Youre also experiencing the problem of the phosphors creating a colour that still appears whiter than what it should be and that also comes down to the quality control of an LED lamp manufacturer and how they bin their LED chips.  The stuff youre buying online from the supermarket etc are as cheap as possible they need to be to be competitive so they use what is called Loose Macadam step binning theyre at the outermost edges of the LED board when its created meaning they have the absolute loosest colour correction possible.  This is qualified in Macadam Steps  and how far away the colour binning is from actual K.  For example Macadam  LED chips are not very noticeable to the human eye from actual K these are not consumer level products. However what youre buying from the supermarket and online is Macadam step  K which can differ MAJORLY even pushing the colour temperature beyond K.It is all really good marketing done by the big manufacturers to pull the wool over peoples eyes as if you put a spectrometer at a  macadam step LED thats K it could easily be K ore more!Unfortunately I cant point you in the right direction as assuming youre from the USA I have no idea where to get these products from in your country.  Here in Australia youre looking at  per luminaire for a goodquality warmdimmable actually warms up as you dim it tightlybinned macadam step  downlight.,Lighting,d4qrezd,3,t5_2qpor
8252112,0,t3_4s7gow, As a lighting enthusiast Im always sceptical about any new LED thingamajig coming from China but these bulbs seem surprisingly nice and well designed. According to my measurements the W bulb does directly replace W incandescent in terms of light quantity and stays cool enough to not fry itself over time. The ones I have tested had E base. If you go up in wattage and down in socket size the problems with heat may arise and reliability may suffer.Fire hazard is minimal as the base is metal and bulb itself usually mineral glass you may want to check with seller. As an aesthetic consideration I would go for more subtle candle design instead of flame. IMO  once mounted the slanted tips may not align in any natural pattern and would look awkward and artificial. Also  get a few spares. On top of possibility of premature failure there is a good chance that light quality color temperature brightness etc. can vary between bulbs to the extent that you may want to discard some that look too different. Hope this helps. Good luck!,Lighting,d592iqq,1,t5_2qpor
8550547,0,t1_d691qci,Light is emitted when an electron makes the jump from one side of a material junction PN junction which is a process maintained by a constant supply of electricity under the right conditions. An LED driven by a constant current will provide a constant source of light.Flicker or strobing occurs when the supply of energy to the LED is not constant which commonly occurs in two situations. The first is when AC current is supplied to the LED circuit and the driver itself does a poor job of creating a constant level supply from the input oscillations. In the bad cases the flicker is very visible with any motion of the LED with respect to the eye. The other case what uIwontsurrender is referencing is created when lighting fixtures use PWM to reduce the intensity of the LED. Pulse width modulation essentially cycles the LED on and off very quickly and the ratio of times determines output. Unless the driver is poorly designed this type of flickering is generally imperceptible to the human eye but can cause issues with video cameras if the frame rate and PWM frequency sync in the wrong way.Essentially all light emitting diodes are dimmable and will only flicker if supplied with nonconstant power or connected to a driver that intentionally modulates duty cycle onoff time.,Lighting,d6ae2s4,2,t5_2qpor
