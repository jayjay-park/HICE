1996014,0,t1_ckphk7x,that was one of the worst DS episodes but it still had a certain charm to it which made it a bit enjoyable. Now the worst ds episode I thought was The Quickening. Episode where the doctor goes to a plague planet he cant cure. Holy crap that was boring and very uninteresting the makeup on the plague victims made it a hard episode to watch.,StarTrekPolls,cktpxo6,1,t5_31jiq

2345598,0,t3_2lzrme,SpoilersI really like the one where halfway through you realize the ship is a duplicate from an episode from the last season maybe the same season I cant remember and they try to meet up with the original Voyager. They end up disintegrating moments before coming within visual range.,StarTrekPolls,cm1mlfk,2,t5_31jiq
