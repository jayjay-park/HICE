3039908,0,t3_2uytws,Much like the Title II provisions in the s lead to the proliferation of telephone carriers in the s after the MaBell breakup Im hoping that the same effect will occur with Internet service providers.I could see the same thing happening in the ISP world and mega mergers between TimeWarner Comcast Cox Verizon Google yes even Google and others should lead to a breakup in a similar matter.  The next incoming FCC chairman will not be able to undo the Title II changes but they will be much more lenient and allow more to go through for a while to let the market feel its way through the changes.  Part of the leniency will allow these mergers through though I expect the ISP management teams to be much more careful and go slow keeping a perception of competition so as to not suffer the breakup that ATampT went through.  But I predict that will eventually come to pass...Once we have reasonable choices to the local highspeed ISP then the consumers dont have to put up with this sort of customer service abuse and can vote with our feet.Nutshell?
