528191,0,t3_2069lc,I dont think it would be weird. I remember when I was in highschool and one of the Harry Potter books got released I think it was the th or th one. I went to the midnight release at the local Barnes amp Noble and there were tons of people dressed up.I dressed up myself but I wore my jedi costume just to fuck with everyone.

1050858,0,t3_262pt2,I enjoyed Steelheart but I was most annoyed by the fact that there are two major plot twists but they are actually the same plot twist twice in both cases it turns out that people who were involved in the Reckoners from the beginning of the story are secretly epics. Seems like he could have figured out a different twist for the second one.,brandonsanderson,chnqjwc,1,t5_2s2s6
1721744,0,t3_2e59j6,First White Sand and Aether of Night  yes Brandon will email them to you if you ask. Eventually. It took him  months back when I asked several years ago but I hear hes gotten better.Second books similar to the Cosmere. If I recall correctly Asimovs Foundation series do something similar thats where Brandon got the idea from but only as an afterthought. Almost a retcon they werent like that by design all in one universe tied up neatly. If you are looking for something with expansive worldbuilding... Well you are in better shape than if you are looking for series that all take place in the Dame universe.Malazan Book of the Fallen is a good example I think but its a heavier and a little darker than Brandons works.The Wheel of Time features some solid worldbuilding too but not as much as Malazan.David Gemmells Rigante and The Stones of Power might offer similar experience but their trick is moving the plot through time the latter spans a period from Arthurian times to a postapocalyptic st  nd century I believe while keeping the magical stones of power a focus of the story Those are the ones I can think of right now. Frankly I dont think any of those are a match for Brandon but I am a bit of a fanboy so feel free to take this with a grain of salt... ,brandonsanderson,cjw6ua7,7,t5_2s2s6

4830865,0,t3_3h0wa5,I think that using stormlight would be a fair idea.  However in order to stay true to the series they need to be bound to a spren.  Luckily there are ten classes that they can work from.  Based on their personality and chosen professions there is a lot of play in this.My suggestion would be to assign their actions SP Stormlight Points.  This acts like mana in traditional games.  Each denomination of currency holds stormlight as well as uncut gems but at a lower value than a cut one ltCanon so assign each sphere a certain value of SP it can hold.  As was shown in the books Stormlight can be taken and given to gems so it would be possible for your players to only partially use a sphere.  This would relegate their actions concerning stormlight so that they couldnt just spam it.  Also it allows you to utilize High Storms which can be predicted and so have a schedule that they can plan their stormlight usage around as well as money exchangers who can trade dun spheres for full ones for a cost of course.Youve already touched that in your post but it is a good idea.  So I say you are on the right track but your players must have a bounded spren in order to use SP and must choose from one of the ten Orders.  This kinda forces your players to fit certain personality requirements but no more than a traditional religion in other DnD games.  Overall I think you have the right idea just come back here when you have it fleshed out.  Im sure wed all be interested to here about your campaign.As to your breaths idea it would function the same as SP with the ability to recover the breaths from the object.,brandonsanderson,cu3gy1b,1,t5_2s2s6

7409333,0,t1_d2jg86j,Theres always another secret.I dont find his endings to be that cliff hangery they generally wrap up quite a few threads and ask one more question  which for me is great.,brandonsanderson,d2ke5ir,4,t5_2s2s6
7459345,0,t1_d2q2sy7,Haha yeah. Its a manageable literary addiction but its when we see stuff like Secret History with a loooot of Cosmere stuff without it being fully explained that the wait hurts. We speculate guess get RAFOed by the man himself but we keep coming back for more. P,brandonsanderson,d2q2x8u,1,t5_2s2s6

7564495,0,t1_d31qsxv,Thanks! Yeah I was surprised myself the first time I saw that page in the second book that was a representation of Shallans sketches of the armour. I thought they looked a bit bulky too and I never even considered that theyd have skirts made of plate. I painted this one blue because I thought it could be a good representation of Adolins suit.,brandonsanderson,d321orh,2,t5_2s2s6

8204750,0,t1_d534xip,The only other novel currently out is Warbreaker. You should definitely read this as is has a minor connection to Stormlight Archives that is quite interesting. BTW Warbreaker is also available for free on Brandons website as a digital download if you want to go that route. Click here for that,brandonsanderson,d535cjo,6,t5_2s2s6
8243510,0,t1_d57u9i9,This seems a controversial opinion but Warbreaker didnt do much for me. I liked a couple of characters development but the plot was a bit bleh.,brandonsanderson,d57zsxm,1,t5_2s2s6

8754442,0,t3_4zxe57,I too was hesitant to read his YA series The Reckoners. I didnt figure I would like a series where the bad guys have superpowers and the good guys dont. Man I was wrong I enjoyed the hell out of it. Ive come to the realization that if it says Brandon Sanderson on the top of the book then it is a great book. ,brandonsanderson,d6zyodw,3,t5_2s2s6

9141134,0,t1_d8ao55m,Im not sure but I feel like a Sphere would not be x less investiture than a Breath. It takes Vasher  Breaths to do tasks in Warbreaker some are more eg when he makes his clothing extensions of his limbs while others are less like making a rope hold things. For the Knights Radiant however it takes a pouch of Spheres to fly around like madmen for a while.,brandonsanderson,d8apdf8,3,t5_2s2s6

9733921,0,t1_dabtqri,He totally retconned it. It started off as a sidefun project but now it actually has important events that matter in the Cosmere so he is counting it as one of the eras.  ,brandonsanderson,dacx26z,4,t5_2s2s6
9821707,0,t1_danptiz,I have been summoned!The short answer is that its entirely up to the venue so you should call them and find out when they lock the doors. Brandon will stay until everyone is taken care of but he event organizers might stop letting people in.,brandonsanderson,dansd7z,8,t5_2s2s6

10392665,0,t1_dcm2gux,That was my major problem with it. I had troubles understanding how the Sand Magic worked and expressions of characters.

11210140,0,t3_600xwt,Id echo somewhat the others here in that its not where I would suggest starting with Sanderson.  Its probably the slowest of his Cosmere novels not bad though.  I started with the Mistborn trilogy The Final Empire is the first book and Id recommend that.  Glimpses of the larger storyshared universe but cohesive in its own right.  ,brandonsanderson,df2nnba,5,t5_2s2s6

11697499,0,t1_dglvvh0,I know in the annotated version is mistborn he says the Cathedral was the inspiration for Keep Venture. But Im also  sure Ive heard him tell a story maybe on his podcast or the classes he teaches on YouTube about seeing the Cathedral at night on a foggy day and getting the idea for a land covered in mist. I hope Im not making that up but I cant find where I got it from now. ,brandonsanderson,dglxho4,15,t5_2s2s6
