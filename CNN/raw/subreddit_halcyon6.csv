9000722,1,t3_53j4r5,I can see where your coming from but how can you say your disappointed when the game wasnt even the type of game you wanted. Also going off a title is no way to buy a game neither is the trailer you have to see it played or look at reviews dont blame the game. You also have to realize this game is meant to be played multiple times so it needs replay value which means randomization of officers and mines. I do agree resources are a pain but there is a point where they are automatic. Also throwing officers into the void is a wastereroll button when selecting them all it does is waste time meanwhile your behind in so many ways Im assuming your difficulty isnt even commander or youd be dead by tier  ships. I dont know it seems like you gave the game a hard time bc you judged it by its cover and got stuck to the mindset that it wouldnt be good unless it was what you thought it was. As for story If you go and search all around for the different sectors and talk to them there is a pretty deep story.I dont want to spoil anything but you havent even gotten to act .,halcyon6,d7tqwt8,2,t5_37j1m
