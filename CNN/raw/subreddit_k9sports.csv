10738184,0,t1_ddmicdr,Yeah I agree that I shouldve cut it off shorter.  minutes doesnt seem like a long time but when youre playing one simple game over and over again it can be a bit boringtaxing for her. Is it normal that she checks one container before going to the correct one? I keep getting the feeling that its more trial and error than actual learning for her sometimes. Im hoping Ill see less of this as time goes on but she still does it from time to time.,k9sports,ddnk9k8,2,t5_3gb38

11722917,0,t3_6793ue,Learning different ways of doing things is a great tool. Each dog is an individual so if you ever get another agility dog having a variety of methods in your toolkit will help. Even if you only have one dog if theyre anything like mine she will have moods where shell run slower or longer. So choose what works best for you and your dog but learn the other methods too you never know when youll need it!,k9sports,dgotms4,2,t5_3gb38
