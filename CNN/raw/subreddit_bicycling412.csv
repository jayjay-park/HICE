1511289,0,t1_cj5ooxw,Well I mostly ride on the GAP trails and last winter there was snow on most of it throughout the winter even when it was warmer. My current bike slipped around a lot.I just pulled my cross bike out of the basement to look at it and its not as bad as I thought it would be. I dont know how to work the presta valves looking it up on YouTube now so I couldnt put air in the tires immediately but im thinking I might just need a new chain and itll be as good as new aside from a few rusted bolts that im assuming could be replaced. If I cant get used to it to ride it I guess I could sell it and not let a perfectly good bike go to waste.,bicycling412,cj5psck,3,t5_2wyfo
