7179446,0,t1_d1or50e,gt do you feel a gleeful fabulist in the background of those lines and get the sense of bit of affectionate legpulling in the reporterlike sentences?I think there might be something like that going on.   Years of Solitude is filled with slippery slope sentences like this one.  At the same time Of Love and Other Demons in its entirety is much more journalistic than much of Marquezs other work in both writing style and structure.  If this is an invasion of the fabulist I dont think its an invasion that Marquez was particularly committed to in writing this book.gt Another thing I notice is which mothers still sang about many years later  that colors the events while theyre still being depicted in the light they will take years from now.This structure is noticeably Marquezian.  I think at the risk of overreading it is worth pointing out that the injection of the old wives tale suggests something of the fabulous something of the rural and something of repetition and lineage.  The mothers in this sentence are the mothers that appear in Marquezs work as Ursula and absolutely not the mothers of other characters like Erendira or more pertinently Sierva Maria herself who falls victim to the plague in Of Love and Other Demons.,Canonade,d1u8lhn,1,t5_3ccrn
7213453,0,t1_d1y29gm,Thats a good point thank you.  I think at the end he admires what he perceives to be the indifference of the universe and strives to achieve that indifference but ultimately fails to because of what you said about him hoping for their hateful reaction. Hes definitely an interesting character.,Canonade,d1y43iu,1,t5_3ccrn

10317313,0,t1_dcb16v2,I know in Gravitys Rainbow theres a part towards the end of the book where Slothrop is wandering the woods and thinking about his ancestor William Slothrop. The guys life story basically maps onto that of William Pynchon one of Thomas Pynchons first ancestors to live in the American colonies. William Pynchon interestingly enough wrote the first book to be banned in the New World and allegedly inspired the Pyncheon of The House of Seven Gables because apparently Hawthorne hated him. I dont actually know if the Hawthorne part has any truth to it tho. It was in like a Vulture article or something.,Canonade,dcdiuof,1,t5_3ccrn
