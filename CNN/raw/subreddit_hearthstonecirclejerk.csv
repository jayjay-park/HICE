5632895,0,t3_3s8yyl,First of all you seem a bit upset calm down. I know being stuck at rank  forever even though you threw money to this game must hurt but chill. You rush to defend the game and say all I say is just ranting and wrong or pointless I already gave some ideas in other posts I dont need to do it in this one if a real AMA would happen I would with details. Why waste my time and share arguments and ideas with you? What can you change? Where are your proposals? All you do is defend the game and attack my posts. Show me your arguments show me your ideas. Show me how your superb insight and logic would help us all. You say the game is young  years and the open beta together with closed beta and development time is considered young and fleshing out? How long do they need to change stuff?  years of complaining? That excuse of yours is as weak as Ben Brodes We dont balance or change cards or add deckslots because the returning player will be confused. There is tons and tons of information and examples of mechanics that other card games use which they could take experiment and go from there. Even some small features like Tournament mode or real time ladder rankings is so simple that an indie dev company could achieve in no time not in  years. I dont say just because im not casual I am better than them and I deserve more casuals bring money to games. I say the game should cater to everyone not just casuals. Give you the CHOICE of deciding how you want to play it. Now the only choice you have is to take xannax so you can remain calm and grind through the bullshit to get to the ladders endgame that is Legend which in reality offers nothing. Or play it for mins per day and laugh it out. You sound like the latter and thats fine but I dont want to be forced to be like you. Also why would my goal be changing your mind you and I are both insignificant same goes for our opinions. Only reason I replied to you is because you mightve thought that I mean the game is doing bad in terms of profits but instead I meant gameplay.,hearthstonecirclejerk,cwvbb92,7,t5_2y8lt

8439800,0,t3_4v7qlf,I think anyone who has ever even glanced at these forums one time would be aware of the fact that one of the strongest opinions held by the fanbase is that we want less RNG not more. This has been clearly reiterated in thousands of posts here and elsewhere.I understand and identify with the communitys position on this folks who want to play competitively want the outcome to be based as much as possible on skill as opposed to slotmachine luck. Winning a game because you DESERVED to validates the time money and effort invested into the enterprise. Now its GG for you if opponent plays a lucky Barnes.The fact that the game designers have devoted resources making the new Barnes legendary RNG card just goes to show that they clearly do not care on iota about what their fanbase thinks about this game. I honestly dont understand this thats how you alienate consumers by ignoring their feedback. Theyve actually got a decent thing going with this Hearthstone game but its not going to last much longer if these guys cant take a hint and stop slapping their fans in the face. Thats just not how you run a business.Its a shame about this card in a party themed expansion pack Barnes had a chance to actually make a really fun mechanic or awesome dance party intro animation perhaps not unlike ETC perhaps especially if he was a little bit more viable than ETC was. Now its just going to cram this forum and others full of QQ stories about Barnes gone right or wrong and detract from the rest of the game.,hearthstonecirclejerk,d5wiid9,1,t5_2y8lt

8532711,0,t1_d67yage,This post will be a rant.Despite loads of criticism over various aspects of the game Blizzard acts as though they are completely contemptuous or havent seen any. Blizzard is highly unresponsive to any communication despite claiming months ago that they want to improve that. Even this upcoming expansion highlights Blizzards ignorance.Blizzard also takes far too long to ever make changes that arent just new cards or expansions even simple changes like more deck slots. Id rather have some general improvements than a new expansion.Golden cards arent put in the same slot in the collection as their nonGolden versions making it so that you have spend an unnecessarily long amount of time going through the Collection which only shows  cards per page and will occasionally lag on mobile devices.An example of a simple change that should be implemented is the ability to make your Golden Portrait not Golden. Right now you are forced to use a Golden Portrait once you get one despite for example some people only wanting Golden Portraits for decks that are entirely Golden.Why isnt there a Spectator Mode for tournaments so that there isnt a yellow bar to hide and so that you can consistently see cards opponents are Discovering? Even with Blizzards own tournaments there are technical difficulties because there isnt a proper Spectator Mode for tournaments.Cards are extremely rarely altered to be balanced. Flamewreathed Faceless is obviously overpowered and it hasnt gotten touched. Seemingly Blizzard never adjusts cards so they dont lose a bit of money from people gaining Dust. Thats the only sane motivation I can think of. Losing money was clearly the same motivation Blizzard had when not giving people any compensation for basically throwing away their cards from Goblins Vs Gnomes and Naxxramas.Whenever a card is Nerfed it is made to be surely unplayable because Blizzard doesnt want to have to potentially readjust it andor be embarrassed.Even after up to years inconsistent and nonsensical card text such as Shadow Madnesss text remain uncorrected.Blizzard seemingly abides by this misguided doctrine that everything must be simple. Its as though an executive told them during development that because the game would eventually reach a mobile audience everything needs to be simple and easy to understand. The majority of players dont need card text to be only  characters long and the doctrine that Blizzard follows reduces overall fun of cards.Even though expansions dont contain a high amount of cards there is a huge amount of filler for each expansion that will never be played past Rank  such as Faceless Behemoth.Arena is completely imbalanced and Blizzard acts like they dont care. They released cards like Shadow Strike and Faceless Summoner and now they are going to release Firelands Portal. To balance Arena they could give cards different rarities than they have normally. As an example they could have Flamestrike be a Rare and have a blue gem in Arena. If they didnt want to implement a list of Arena rarities for cards in game they could do so on their website or not have a list at all. Blizzard also seems to make things up as they go such as how interactions will work and their reasoning for things. They claimed that Firelands Portal wasnt complex so its a Common so apparently Moonglade Portal is complex so its a Rare. Even if they followed that system correctly they shouldnt throw away balance for that gimmicky system.Instead of deck trackers being ingame by default you have to go out of your way to get a finicky thirdparty deck tracker that disadvantages players who dont use deck trackers.Those are some reasons off of the top of my head that I believe the development has been terrible.,hearthstonecirclejerk,d685jl2,3,t5_2y8lt

8641581,0,t1_d6lsvmi,A quick introduction Im a psychology PhD and a consistent legend player since Naxx. While I maintain my own psychology blog I wanted to write a bit about Hearthstone card assessment but the material doesnt fit my own site for obvious reasons. I was hoping to find another site willing to host this piece but havent found any luck yet.First some perspective. Im an ANT player. If you dont know what that is its not important just know its a deck Im very passionate about and that Ive played for three years now. Thats right Ive played the same deck for the years and its never gotten stale. Why? Because the enjoyment comes from mastering the deck from fine tuning my decision making my sequencing from learning how to play around the latest and greatest shenanigans.Whoever decided flamewreathed faceless should be a common card definitely never played any arena screw him. Blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about WoW arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to PvE or even battlegrounds even though they kept saying it wasnt the case. Only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother. Well I dont care I play mainly constructed now but still blizzard never changes.,hearthstonecirclejerk,d6lt2js,9,t5_2y8lt

I guess when Blizzard made the Classic set they didnt foresee Standard rotation happening or it becoming an evergreen set or anything but I think a future where these cards are always in the game seems kinda dull. Hopefully they will slim it down to a core set of just bland but functional cards such as Fireball Swamp Ooze Loot Hoarder stuff like that. Even getting rid of that would be good but it would mean expansions probably need a lot more cards.MTG long since did away with stuff like Lightning Bolt  mana  damage Wrath of God  mana kill everything and Counterspell  mana counter any spell in favour of a larger variety of weaker more situational effects and the result is you have to make more careful choices in deckbuilding rather than just jamming in the OP cards. Plus theres always Wild where you can always play all the old classics which will hopefully grow into something as separate and interesting as MTGs Modern format over the years.Do people agree or do you like the idea of Classic sticking around forever? How about newer players?,hearthstonecirclejerk,d6o282d,4,t5_2y8lt

At first I called bullshit on the you can use this without combo if you dont want to make your board worse argument because I tunnel visioned on the fact that this card is trash. But that argument is actually valid.This card can be situationally better or worse than Youthful Brewmaster you cant really say its better or worse than it  of the time. If the effect also reduced the minions cost by  Im not even asking for a  mana decrease like Shadowstep just  mana then I would be happy with the card.That said we will most probably never see this card played seriously in constructed but Id rather play this than Poisoned Blade or Backstreet Leper I consider Backstreet Leper to be the biggest insult of the expansion so far.,hearthstonecirclejerk,daf2zy4,14,t5_2y8lt

Blizzard not giving any fuck about rogue design space remind me about WoW class design where it was obvious you were considered a second class citizen compared to death knight or even druid even though they kept saying it wasnt the case. Only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother. Well I dont care I play mainly shaman now but still blizzard never changes.,hearthstonecirclejerk,ddb37j7,6,t5_2y8lt
