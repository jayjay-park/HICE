11167811,0,t3_5ze3fq,He is known for his machete that is for sure. But we didnt think it would be interesting if every Jason had a machete. We wanted to branch out a little. But then you get a little bit stuck when you start thinking about what types of weapons would be readily available to Jason around Crystal Lake.When you watch the films he used more found objects for oneoff kills than anything. That or just brute force kills. The found or impromptu weapons became our environmental kills. The brute force no weapon became a part of our weaponless kills that each Jason has. And then lastly a weapon based kill. When we sat with Savini and talked through all of this and keep in mind there are some limitations to animationriggingmotion capture to consider we wanted the weapon to be real and something that made sense. Meaning a weapon could find while walking around. Theres also weapon length to consider. For example J is carrying the polefence that he ripped from the fence just after being dug up. That is the longest weapon we can put in the game due to all the animation capsules associated with characters interactions etc. It wouldnt be cool if Jason walked up to a door and his weapon stuck through the door before he opened it. So we needed to keep weapons somewhat short and he needed to carry it with one hand. His off hand needs to be able to grab people open doors throw knives etc. J can attack using two hands but while not attacking hes carrying it one handed. So when these limitations start stacking up you start to see that your options become somewhat sparse. The axe was a weapon that we felt checked off all the boxes. And there are different types of axes that we could put in the game thus giving a unique look and allow Savini to craft unique kills. We tried to use all sides of each axe from the handle to all sides of the blade. So were we  with the films? No. But we did our very best to keep with the source while at the same time provide some form of gameplay variety. There is only so much you can do with a machete and whereas the axe was a little more versatile.W,F13thegame,dexuyi6,40,t5_3abo0
