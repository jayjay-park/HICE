2032998,0,t1_ckxkjl7,thank you for your post. That was more or less the same idea I have about the French ltigtrgimeltigt. Ive actually subscrbed some plans at the bank and in few years they output about  to  in return using the euro average method every month I invest a fixed amount of money.Ive some stocks too. But I think that the stock market has high costs for the personal investor as me because the small amount of money I invest Ive to pay high fees.I was hoping to find out some products or way to get a higher output ,eupersonalfinance,cky8lmd,2,t5_2w5jv

3416636,0,t3_2yxj5q,Here is a very summarized process for buying real estate in France.. Have at least  of the price in cash typically . Find the property you like agree on a price with the vendor. Confirm in writing email to the seller your intention to purchase. This is not legally binding but reassures the seller that you are serious.. The seller or his agent organizes a meeting with a notaire to sign a Promesse de Vente. This usually takes  months because of all the paperwork to prepare. You pay  of the price. This contract means that the seller commits to selling the property to you. He cannot back out from that commitment under any circumstances not even death !. In return you commit to buying but you can still back out if  either you can prove you couldnt get a loan or  for convenience but then you have to pay  of the price  you already paid   and get nothing in return.. You have  months to finalize your financing obtain loans sell assets  to pay for the purchase transfer money etc. Warning in France when you get a loan offer you cannot accept it before waiting  days cooling off period so take that into account in your planning. If you are even  day late on this  months period and the seller is an asshole who applies the law strictly again you loose .. Pay the price of the property  you already paid . various taxes. Wire the money to the notaire. Meet at the notaire to sign the final sale. Get the keys to your new property.All in all buying real estate cannot be done in less than  months.,eupersonalfinance,cphpypg,2,t5_2w5jv
3490055,0,t1_cppiom7,Hey thereIll try to answer to all your questions please let me know if Im forgetting something. Ill start with your last question Im really not sure whats the deal with nationalitycountry of origin and the impact on taxes so I wont be able to help you on that. Now for the other things...Yes its true that when you invest at the beginning of the year overall returns tend to be larger quite logical since if you start investing in December but already had the capacity in January you missed an entire year of opportunities. I just tend to spread it and pay off the required monthly amount . Overall returns are probably lower than the depositinJanuary method but it happens automatically and I buy stockbons when theyre high as well as when theyre low. Hence the result will be a nice average between worst case and best case scenarios since you buy little pieces of the fund so often.On Long Term Saving I purposely didnt get too much into detail. As youve suggested if the monthly ratio you have to pay off for your mortgagehouse loan decreases with the duration of your loan there will be a time that you could pair up the Tak  long term saving together with the mortgage. But thats only if theres any fiscal space for it thats how they call it. You could calculate it with a taxplanner or let your advisor run the calculations for you but theyd need your tax data in order to be complete. Note that the fiscal space of your mortgage is larger than that of Long Term Saving. The latter is capped at  but should be indexed again in a few years but the former can be up to k. Not sure on the numbers since the laws on that just changed back in January.Your employer does something similar indeed but thats usually not in a mixed fund but rather some kind of Insurance such as TAK . Note that however rates are quite low at the moment they do vary over the course of a full carreer. The end result is never bad... However you might be getting benefits in the form of stock or derivatives as well?Of course apart from the TAK  in your Long Term Saving Life Pension Plan Plus since theres no mixed fund alternative within the bracket of Long Term Saving you could also take TAK  as a nontax deductible investment vehicle if you wanna play super safe. Be aware though that entree fees exceed  and guaranteed returns are under  on a duration of  years. Hence you net out on less than  after taxes... Not per year but over a duration of  years. That sucks so dont do it.As a matter of fact I know the Privileged Portfolio funds quite well. Gotta set some things straight though it doesnt contain any capital guarantees. Its a new system which is actively monitored cap guar is passive contains stocks bonds cash real estate forex... and switches between these investment vehicles. It does offer another kind of protection bodembewaking not sure how to explain this in English which is a better system imo. Capital guarantee does just that it guarantees that you get your invested capital back in a certain amount of years. It doesnt protect your earnings in the meantime. Privileged Portfolio puts a new downward cap on the total value of the fund every year. F.e. the February  version does this for  percent of the net present value of the fund at the end of each January so it starts with a new cap every February. The steep cost could be explained because of the fact that this is a very expensive product to make and its quite unique on the market as well. Say that you would have invested in the EUROSTOXX somewhere in  you would have gotten a blow of close to  by april . What did Priv.Port. do? .. How well it just bounced on the cap and just threw out all stock and kept it cash so it could automatically invest again when stock began to rise. In the meantime they did get quite some income from bonds since rates rose pretty steep that time especially bonds from financial institutions. Of the bill. EUR thats invested with KBC more than  is invested in that type of mixed fund. Id advise the  version though stockbond is more fifty fifty but equities can be built up a lot more. In the long run the  versions should do better especially now that bonds are so expensive this might have a bigger negative effect on the  version if rates rise.My parents have it I have very happy with it... Its pretty much the base structure of an investment portfolio. Its super diversified and theres a cap on your losses. I see it as a way to let somewhere around  of total portfolio just sit and rest until I decide to use the money for something. Its pretty much the backbone of your portfolio since it can take a bunch of blows without resulting in large amounts of capital loss. But Im sure if youre talking about a large amount of savings you could get a deal on the entree fees. Ask for  or maybe  percent discount depending on the amount you wish to invest. If they cant give it thats that but at least youve asked.Next to the backbone you can diversify a bit. Maybe use Bolero or another online broker to trade some individual stock maybe options or turbos. Maybe some ETFs or other funds without cap guaratees but with a lower cost. Anyway I gladly pay for some sort of security such as in Priv. Portfolio and you can NEVER build a diversified portfolio like that in your own spare time and imo not even with a lower cost rate since you would have to buy stock bond etf forex and hedge against the downward risk... that would ask tremendous time and effort and money....Ideally youd have a solid backbone like that mixed fund with a downward cap under active control computer monitored and experiment on the side with a smaller amount of your total portfolio in some etf or stocks maybe options and try hedging the downward risk of your stock. Im not a bond lover so I dont buy those at the side maybe cause Im not too knowledgeable on them but also because theyre fiscally less attractive higher taxes and return is generally lower as in quality stock. Especially now since stock dividend tends to be larger than bond coupons. But thats just my opinion of course. Hope this helps! Diversifying is key if you want to INVEST. If you wanna speculate well... Im not too into that ,eupersonalfinance,cpq3aji,3,t5_2w5jv
3960612,0,t3_35rkvi,I agree with danzania that they are relatively comparable. From a first glance it seems that MSCI ACWI has the highest weightage in emerging countries among the  ETFs and MSCI World UCITS ETF has the lowest. Vanguards Total World Stock is somewhere in between. With the lowest expense ratio Vanguard probably makes the most sense as your CORE. And if you plan to follow a CoreSatellite strategy you can choose an Emerging market focused ETF later to increase your exposure.In Germany some brokers have Sparplans that waive transactions fees for ETFs from certain companies therefore just check with your broker first to see if the ETFs above qualify for you.All the best.,eupersonalfinance,cr7qrk9,1,t5_2w5jv

5359745,0,t1_cvwrmpv,Its more for a lowincome family earning e.g K in the UK the tax is somewhat negligible but in NL it would be a very significant amount of disposable income.NL jumps to  at Kish compared to the K in the UK.  Anything below that amount has significantly lower tax in the UK.I guess theres enough alternative benefits that tax rates alone very much fail to show the full picture.UK taxes also include health care.Edit  UK take home on that would be more than  EUR inc. health care in comparison.   EUR vs  EUR is a big difference.,eupersonalfinance,cvwrnju,2,t5_2w5jv

5640419,0,t1_cwvmh6k,Thanks for your answer I think I will contact De Hypotheker they should be pretty good at figuring this out.I didnt know you could get a loan for over the value of the flat but since I will not benefit the tax rebates and will rent the flat for the period of the loan Ill try to figure out with them what is the cheaper option but flexibility on the amount is probably something I should look for even if we have to pay a premium for that since our salaries will probably decrease when we will leave the UAE.Thanks also for the big banks Ill definitely contact them.I wish you all the best with your purchase in December ,eupersonalfinance,cww8y02,2,t5_2w5jv
