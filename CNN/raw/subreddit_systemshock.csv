8214302,0,t3_4rt4ar,I also suggested a Collectors Edition . Floppy Disk with the new System Shock label on it. A message from NDS would be written to the . Mb drive. Maybe it could be in its own classic packaging too.,systemshock,d54cc3u,2,t5_2ueb5
8222035,0,t3_4rtxcp,Okay my friend and I have never played System Shock feel free to check out our video on the Reddit page for our first exposure and it confused us with there being limbs in boxes and crates. Do these limbs ever serve a purpose? You mention that it didnt make sense then and it doesnt make sense now so Im curious if it was just completely random and useless in the original game ?,systemshock,d55b743,1,t5_2ueb5
8225912,0,t3_4rrofb,My hardware may be too potato if linux adds any hardware demands. However Im willing to at least give it a try.,systemshock,d55sn5a,1,t5_2ueb5
8231830,0,t1_d56c0kt,For example pls check out this different hopefully effective Feedback Thread regarding much shorter feedback in as few words as possible.In the midst of the tons of feedback in a novel form here and there we are aware of that and trying to do our best too in order to make our feedback more easier to go through. Good to know that you wont forget. NDS have already shown that you could be trusted firstly bc of succeeding in  funding. Congrats again!  Its not about the money but how much we trust on you.This Project is in good hands.,systemshock,d56j9my,2,t5_2ueb5
8240066,0,t3_4s6tud,Its the kind of thing thats easy to mess up.For instance I thought the recent Shadowrun games did The Matrix in a horrible way that was just additional busywork. It ruined the flow of the game and made it feel like large empty gameplay segments you just had to get through instead of a cool world full of wonder.So unless they have a very clear and established vision  Id rather they do it like say Deus ExHR  where its a significant gameplay system  but not one that bogs the game down and you can skip it for the most part.I have a hard time visualising a truly great Cyberspace implementation  so thats why Im sceptical.I adore the original System Shock  and I admire the fact that it bothered to even HAVE Cyberspace. But lets be honest here it just wasnt that good. So I think it gets credit for simply having it  more than doing it well.If I set aside my nostalgiaglasses I actually prefer the System Shock  hacking  because it was fast and it integrated well with the RPG system.,systemshock,d57kby8,2,t5_2ueb5
8355638,0,t3_4u0pgi,Ill admit the RPG elements promise had me worried but the points outlined clarifying what that meant are great. ,systemshock,d5m0a6w,2,t5_2ueb5
11083963,0,t3_5y786y,Im personally hopeful they have a lot of people with great track records on this going. I think its gonna be a Fallout  to New Vegas sort of modernization as in it no longer needs you reading a long ass manual to get going but still very deep both in story and gameplay. I hope its mostly things such as making sure the maps are less mazelike while still complex and fun to navigate and also add more visual diversity to the maps. ,systemshock,deocvl6,3,t5_2ueb5
