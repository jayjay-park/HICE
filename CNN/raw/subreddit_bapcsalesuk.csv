2432024,0,t1_cmbjpe1,Just for future reference you dont really need to confirm this. Drives will generally work just fine. Maybe check you have a free SATA III port rather than a SATA II port since III will give you a better speed for SSDs.Other than that just make sure to get SATA drives and youre probably fine. There are different kinds for different purposes Western Digital have green blue and black which have different speeds and are good for PCs Reds are good for  dedicated NAS storage for example,bapcsalesuk,cmcazpx,2,t5_31rwf
