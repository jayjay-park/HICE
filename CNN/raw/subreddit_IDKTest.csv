From this I can conclude one of two thingseither kids today are even more jaded than previously suspected or more likely The Lazarus Effect is such a limp excuse for a horror movie that it cannot even get a rise out of a couple of kids out past their bedtime on a school night. The film is yet another riff on the old chestnut of arrogant scientists who discover the secret to bringing the dead back to life and discover to their amazement that it is not all that it is cracked up to be.It is the rare studio that can take successful auteurs like Barry Levinson or M. Night Shymalan and reduce them to directing found footage horror rather then working the other way round and using these projects to give them their initial big break.
