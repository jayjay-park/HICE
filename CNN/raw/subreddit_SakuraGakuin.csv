The best bet would be to just leave him do his thing and ignore him if you dont like him it seems like no matter what hell keep posting what he wants and everyone cracking down on him isnt going to make much of a difference at this pointEdit also he could be a bit younger and just not understand Im relatively young as well and I find various topics he posts are things I was thinking about myself,SakuraGakuin,cutj5gw,1,t5_31mhn

5519062,0,t1_cwh1qrq,Rosetta Stone was the first thing I used to try to learn Japanese but knowing what little I know now I wouldnt recommend it at all. At least not for absolute beginners. It just starts by teaching you words like Otokonoko and Onnanoko which seems like a pretty arbitrary and odd place to begin. I didnt get very far into it but I saw nothing about learning to read Hiragana Katakana or Kanji either.Ive found so many other great resources now that actually teach you rather than just having you memorize a bunch of random words. I might go back to Rosetta Stone and use it sort of like I use flash cards now but its definitely only for practice and not so much for learning anything.,SakuraGakuin,cwh3z8w,4,t5_31mhn

5637064,0,t3_3saocj,I dont think the album will sound like Mathematica at all and I agree its one of their weaker songs just like Animal Rhythm was the weakest song on the last album and Hana Hana on the album before it. All of those songs had a more electronic sound compared to the rest of the songs on the albums which were more rock sounding. Arent all three of those songs part of a learning series or something?

6281794,0,t1_cz3mak4,Although I love Mori and think he is a big part of what makes Logirl entertaining.

6284326,1,t1_cz3vstr,I think the songs are good particularly this newest one. The biggest difference for me is the sound. I agree it is very young a higher than ever. I think this is down obviously to the low average age of the group but also the lack of vocal strength and vocal maturity of the senior members In terms of vocals Rinon is probably the weakest president SG has ever had. Ayami and Suzuka were fantastic The mature voices of Rau Nene Hinata and Marina made  amazing And although I could listen to Yui and Moas voices all day long I think Hana deserves credit for bringing the mature sound to nendo I think SG brought in Mirena to add the mature element but cant feature her to the extent that they would like to thid year because the grads have to take leading roles by SG tradition,SakuraGakuin,cz3ygox,0,t5_31mhn

6438448,0,t3_43ranf,Yo Im from the US of A. When I first got into Sakura Gakuin the first songs I heard were Song For Smiling Verishuvi and Doki Doki Morning. As we all know Suzuka does some hella vocal performances on those songs and I was really into her singing ability. Then cut two like two days later and Im looking around YouTube and Dailymotion checking what kind of sick vids I can watch of SG and I find this  . for those who dont know that is one of the best SG videos of all time in my opinion. The way Suzuka reacts to the surprise had me feeling some type of way. As I continued in my SG journey other girls became more of my bias as them KPoppers might say but Suzuka will always have a special place in my heart because she was one of the first that really stuck out. I mean of course right? Shes the singer of BabyMetal lmao. But yeah I am trying to collect all the photobooks and the Suzuka is one of the ones I dont already have so itd be cool to have it!

It was hell to keep watching halfway through the first season since it was really boring and pace is so slow. But it was rewarding when the dots starts to connect. As long as you follow the story and not get lost its actually pretty good. Anyway im just giving you what to expect if you continued watching it. And uh...should I try Battlefield ?

8286717,0,t3_4szgn3,Popular? Yes.  As popular? Thats harder to call.    As long as the overall SG product was still as strong had BM never existed they would still likely be just as popular in Japan at least.    Internationally thats tougher to guess. Yes many people including myself discovered SG via BM. Then again many international fans of Japanese idols had heard of them anyway. And even those who had encountered BM first a fair chunk of the idol fans probably would have discovered SG eventually.    Also as several members past and present have either come from or gone onto other popular projects I suspect that people would have discovered SG by following from there too.  ,SakuraGakuin,d5decoy,9,t5_31mhn

8342726,0,t3_4so59v,This graduating class was a real interesting mix of personalities and I think that is what made them so interesting.  Rinon  the stoic leader Ooga  another long time member.  It was amazing to see her grow out of her shy shell into one of the best voices SG has had and finally CChan who was literally living the ultimate fukei fantasy.  Favorite memories outside of singingRinon  Literally never crying at any graduation and having the other members always pointing it outOoga  That intro video with Nenedon was HILARIOUS.    lt If anybody has not seen it yet I highly recommend.  I think Ooga said some things she was not supposed to lol!CChan  The sheer happiness she displayed and obvious fangirling was intoxicating.  Going to have to split this between her stealing the farewell poster at Logirl that was signed by YunanoHanaMoaYui and the shockhappiness at her surprise birthday celebration on stage. I REALLY wish there was some footage of that though.   She looked absolutely stunned when they sung to her.  ,SakuraGakuin,d5ke84e,1,t5_31mhn

8888964,0,t3_51zxft, I was torn between Yume Ni Mukatte and Message but Im going with Message because it has this calming nostalgic feeling to it and nostalgia is pretty much what I feel when I think of  nendo FRIENDS because of the amazing video they made where evebody can see the friendship and the bonds between the girls its just wonderful. My second choice would be See You.  Marshmallow Iro No Kimi To won over MGT only because of the suprise party for Su. Also the lyrics so endearing it just pulls the right strings in the heart Although I wanted to go with IJI I have to say Mikansei Silhouette. The music box intro was enough to convince me. This song IMHO perfectly captures the sad feeling of graduating while at the same time consoles the remaining students and reassures them that everything will be alright  This one is hard for me. I cant decide between Heart No Hoshi Gokigen Mr. Tropicalory and Takaramono. Each song has its different vibe to it which conveys different feelings. I just cant choose between these Well theres not so much choice here Id go with Michishirube. I dont even know how to begin to describe this amazing song.

I know they were all s covers but I was hoping she would at least continue with that organic sound using real instruments instead of programming.I cant even guess what she might have planned. I only know she wants to come back as an artist rather than an idol. I expect she will drop the gaudy idol costumes at least and probably the choreography.

This nendos upcoming graduation means alot to me because I am also in my final fifth year of university course and the way how my course resembles Sakura Gakuins year classes followed by a graduation ceremony. Also this years graduation concert is just a day before the final day of my finals exam. I am really blown away by the new band versions of the old songs  they breathe a totally new hype to the songs that I love so much especially Otomegokoro and Marshmallow iro no kimi to. And did I mention how lovely the new graduation duet song yubikiri and identity sounds? They nearly brought tears to my eyes by just listening to that short segment of preview.

11548777,0,t1_dg4sleb,Unlikely reasoning. Moas prefecture is among the richest in Japan close to Tokyo average salary and other Sakura girls had pets. Space shouldnt be an issue either since she took care of her friends dog when she traveled. Probably had more to do with her infamous mother with the bird and Marimo moss being a compromise.,SakuraGakuin,dg521tb,1,t5_31mhn
11561639,0,t1_dg5wnq2,gt How do we write in Japanese something like I want to see Sakura Gakiun and Perfume doing insert song name toghether ?Ive never studied Japanese seriously aside from reading or translating SG and BABYMETAL stuff so my production skills are a bit behind but I guess it could be something likePerfumesong nameAnyway I think you can just select Perfume and put Sakura Gakuin as the group you want them to perform together?Also I think spamming wont help because they will decide themselves anyway its not a vote kind of thing imho,SakuraGakuin,dg6illb,3,t5_31mhn
