983072,0,t1_chfffoi,I think I got the errors all straightened out. One other issue I had was the settings for nzb.su inside of sabnzb. I needed to almost enter in all new info so nzb.su could control sabnzb. At first I tried full API but in the end it worked only when I used just the NZB API from nzb.su and not the full API even though it states I can use either one.Thanks again for your help.,sickbeard,chg17l5,1,t5_2vpxu

7076092,0,t1_d1i3spc,Thanks decided to tough it out with launching two instances with different dbs and running on different ports and so far it seems to work fine. We will see after tonights new stuff comes in. I use Plex and I intend on making a separate library just for New HD TV and delete files that are say three weeks old. ,sickbeard,d1ift6h,1,t5_2vpxu
