4433866,0,t3_32rwd5,gtI missed something. Why is Annerose leaving Lohengramms estate and wanting less contact from him now when they arguably need each other more than ever?Annerose is leaving Lohengramms estate is important for several reasons.First of all is what they symbolise. Unlike Reinhard Annerose has no ambition. She simply wants a quiet idealic life whereas Reinhard wants to conquer the universe and lead mankind into a golden age. Thus in a strange way she represents stasis whereas Reinhard represents the future and progress. She is inherently a symbol of the Conservative everstatic Goldenbaum whereas Reinhard is a symbol of the Liberal everchanging Goldenlowe.Secondly there is a reason more concerned with plot than theme and that is about Sieg it is heavily heavily implied that Annerose loved Sieg. And thus by losing Sieg Annerose lost everything she had and could not bare the possibility of losing Reinhard as well as might happen in war. Furthermore she felt that she might drag him down or distract him from his ultimate goal which would also amount to the ultimate betrayal of Sieg.gtIs there supposed to be some implication that Kircheiss murder was actually planned by Oberstein or some third party?On the Oberstein point sort of. Oberstein certainly shares some fault for it but that fault is pretty much completely coincidental. Oberstein cares about the Empires well being and progress more than anything else  as Reinhard will later state Oberstein would kill Reinhard if he thought that Reinhard presented a threat to the Empire. Oberstein would never have so flippantly killed off one of the most important humanitarian and devoted members of the new Empire who represented everything Oberstein wanted the new empire to be like. He only ever disliked Reinhards favoritism towards Sieg but not Sieg himself as he feels that favoritism can lead to infighting.But it was certainly planned by someone and we are told who it is in the next episode Marquis Lichtendale which is why he is capture and killed along with most of his family.gtbut I found the fact that Kircheis and albeit others were forced to disarm beforehand awfully suspicious in fact Kircheis seemed to think so for half a second too.It was sheer coincidence. Every other officer had never been allowed near Reinhard armed. Sieg was the only exception due to Reinhards absolute trust of him which is what Oberstein took issue with. So Oberstein overrid Reinhard that day but he of course had no way of knowing that it was the same day that someone would try to kill Reinhard.,logh,cspkrc6,1,t5_2tlzp
4813610,0,t3_3gs7ts,Im glad someone in this world is able to see some flaws in LoGH.  I personally enjoyed the show a lot but I definitely wouldnt call the show perfect or an intellectual masterpiece like many others do.  In my opinion it was a wellwritten intelligent show with a wellthought out plot and interesting characters and not much more.  ,logh,cu1anl8,4,t5_2tlzp

9704402,0,t1_da85wbi,Yeah. Dont know much about the military here. However there is a retired Lt Gen H S Panag who seems to have the flair for strategic thinking.If India is the FPA Pakistan is like a much smaller version of the Galactic Empire since it is a military dictatorship for all practical purposes,logh,da99xm2,2,t5_2tlzp
