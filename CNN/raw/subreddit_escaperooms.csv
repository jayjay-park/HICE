5423992,0,t3_3pbaee,Hi! Keeping your room running smoothly should definitely be one of you main concerns! Use objectstechnology that wont inherently fail. Of course customer destruction is another hurdle to get through. I like to tell new owners to follow a Murphys Law when approaching potential customer destruction. While most players are rational thinkers and a simple warning at the start of rooms is enough sometimes adrenal runs high and those rules are forgotten. Make sure you are constantly taking steps to make your room as indestructible as possible. On the other hand of that comment sometimes less is more. You may find that something is consistently broken despite your best efforts  lets say a painting on the wall. If you really nail the painting into the wall when that gets pulled down you would have to redrywall etc. On the other hand if people are breaking it anyways you may want to have it simply be put up with strong doublesided tape or glue where you would simply have to repaint. It may not be as strong but if its going to get pulled down anyways it would be a lot easier to repaint than redrywall. I hope that all makes sense! One of the other issues is of course is customer acquisition. There are many ways to solve this problem make sure youre actively adding your business to every free modality of advertisement. Places like escape room directory play exit games etc. We offer an escape room map at   you can send us an email to get your room listed if youre not already. Were also going to be offering another secret modality in the near future! I hope some of this helps Im more than happy to keep discussing other issues if you have any questions! I felt like my comment was getting long!,escaperooms,cw4yz7g,1,t5_35o1v

7624931,0,t3_4jn80f,All of the below happened in a pretty highbudget Escape Room in a city with several high quality companies doing this sort of thing. We had opted to do the extended  minute experience so I was expecting something really cool and worth the extra fee but was really disappointed. Onetimeuse tools  under the guise of having an arsenal to solve puzzles we were given a dufflebag of tools and toys to help us infiltrate articulate and escape. We had stuff like an RC car cell phone with preprogrammed apps even a flash drive that only worked on one machine. Everything had a single use and there was no way to combine or use it any different way. Very rigid. Very disappointing. They say you should avoid any and all red herrings and having a whole bag of tech is the biggest one I can think of. Solution? Think Zelda  how can you combine or use the tool in a way one might not consider? How would you guide the player into intuiting this use themself? Not encountering explicit plot elements  we were told there would be a guard surveying the area every half hour and much of our progress was made and halted because we had to hide from personnel. The guard never came. There was no way to know if we had simply missed them or if we successfully disabled the summon guard trigger? or anything. We were told to expect something pretty substantive to the experience and when we didnt there was no clear indication that we had done something to avoid it. Gamemaster intervention  the gamemaster actually came into the room and told us that we had done something wrong and that we shouldnt have progressed as far as we had where we were. We didnt break anything hadnt forced anything open or otherwise abused the room as far as we could tell we simply progressed further than the gamemaster had intended using a path they hadnt anticipated. This broke immersion and we never got it back.  Leftover props from another sequence setting  there were clearly props leftover from when the room was set up in a different configuration by different configuration I mean like the swipe card is in the breast pocket and not under the stack of papers. We found an entire path that had pretty significant contextbased elements that simply werent used. Red herring mentioned above? This was a whole vestigial puzzle string that wasnt incorporated.  Technology beyond plugandplay  one puzzle had us forwarding an email and a file from the abandoned computer in an office we infiltrated. To do that we had to  I kid you not  find a password diagnose and fix internet connectivity issues and then forward to two different email addresses. From the gmail account we could tell that there were several other groups that did the same thing so the room wasnt even reset properly. The file was kept in the accounts Drive folder and had I not gone snooping we wouldnt have even found it. If we hadnt been techsavvy I cant imagine we would have been able to even get that far. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth from this experience. The company has a great reputation stellar social media following and some of the highest budget and talent team Ive seen so it came as a shock to me that the first game I try this extended and higherprofile more complete version of their room was such an underwhelming experience. It really felt like it could have been great ,escaperooms,d38wws2,3,t5_35o1v

There are different distributions we prefer freepbx. It runs reliably on an inexpensive computer and works over your network  some phones connect via wifi but weve had better luck with wired phones ,escaperooms,d6g3ojk,1,t5_35o1v

9004695,0,t3_52a5u0,Nice tips! I learned lesson  the hard way a few months ago when I opened my second room. The theme and story were weak and it was essentially just a room full of locks and puzzles. Very poorly received and for good reason. I wont make that mistake again! Thankfully my first room is still going strong enough so to keep me in business until I get a third room done to replace the disastrous one. ..,escaperooms,d7u830q,1,t5_35o1v
9963080,0,t1_db4mawh,It sounds like we have very similar situations.  I manage my business very much the same way.I go through and do minor maintenance all the time.  Replace labels papers anything printable anything that gets gross from being handled etc.  I have to recreate pieces of puzzles too.  Swap out props etc.Ive found that keeping it cheap doesnt really matter as long as it feels true to the theme and the cheapness of it is not distracting.Ive also found that over time the cost gets far more manageable.  I dont feel like Im spending nearly as much now . months in as I did  month in.Then there are the props that are scary to replace or fix on the spot if they break.  Audio clues computers tablets etc.  Ive started to move away from having too much tech in the rooms for this purpose  but its hard  all my rooms still have SOMETHING thats a little more technical or difficult to replace.,escaperooms,db67ris,1,t5_35o1v

11526176,0,t3_64ho26,I went to one where we were split into  groups and one group was handcuffed to a desk while the other group was in another room. One group had or could find the handcuff key and the other had to collaborate to be able to unlock the door that separated them. It was nice once that obstacle is overcome the whole group could work together.Edited to add No walkietalkies just raised voices through a door.,escaperooms,dg2hsew,2,t5_35o1v

Sudoku have no place in these rooms and Im glad that other people see that too.That being said what do you or anyone suggest for alternate puzzle designs that dont have to do with awkward number puzzles or too many locks?Secondary question Are actors a good idea overall or should they be generally avoided as a rule?,escaperooms,dg6sdpc,1,t5_35o1v
