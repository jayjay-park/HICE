166387,0,t3_1vzgxv,gt What happens if longterm side effects like lung disease or psychosis emerge in aftermarket testing years from now? How would medical marijuana interact with blood pressure medication the patient is already taking?As if this isnt a risk with drugs that come on the market every day.  The difference being that our newest andgreatest laboratory creations may undergo testing for a few years in pristine conditions yet they still manage to fuck up and miss things.  Cannabis has k years of recorded use.  One would think that with the prominence of use over that time and especially now we would notice the major concerns in our current population. ,SensibleCanada,cexduoc,1,t5_2z1f2

1129804,0,t1_chs0s8o,Yeah the regulations are written in a way that would appear to give Health Canada the opportunity to recall just about anything. To test at just over  for basic bacteria is very low. If you pick some lettuce out of your garden it would likely test tens or hundreds of times higher.All the more reason to just legalize recreational. Trying to ram marijuana into pharmaceutical definitions of medicine is fraught with problems. Legal it for all adults and let people medicate on their own especially since doctors dont want to prescribe it.,SensibleCanada,chwpnvw,1,t5_2z1f2

1967782,0,t1_ckiyuyf,So not convinced yet in the USA you need special permission to use this technology. Not scary enough yet? There are no studies today demonstrating the safety of smoking irradiated cannabis. Treatment of other medicinal plants with irradiation Digitalis Ephedra and others have been shown to negatively effect constituent profiles Samuelsson  and in other plant material to specifically lower terpenoid levels e.g. cilantro oranges fan and Gates  Fan and Sokarai . So irradiation may similarly negatively affect the general composition and specific terpenoid profile of cannabis. The lesson here buyer beware but be educated.,SensibleCanada,ckqbhof,1,t5_2z1f2

2251894,0,t1_clq1yao,I dont have a copy of the letter that I can post publicly no. Sorry.I understand what you mean by arbitrary but obviously they have to choose a distance based on something. Whats potentially arbitrary about it is ifwhen other LPs and there are a few who have been approved who have residences closer than that. So the distance itself isnt arbitrary any more than the speed limit or blood alcohol count for a DUI is arbitrary but the enforcement of it arguably is because its apparently not consistent ,SensibleCanada,clq20xr,1,t5_2z1f2
