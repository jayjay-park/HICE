2292785,0,t3_2lhrlp,gtI dont think I am very privileged when it comes to racial or gender issuesI think you are on the right track asking questions and reading for yourself but this  is where you should be a little more careful because things like this are indicative of your own and frankly everyones biases it is always the others that seem privileged wrong or foolish always the others... The closer to the normative meaning privileged we are the more invisible our privilege gets. This is because the priviliged is often offered as the norm before the culture wars in the s everyone was supposed to have a house in the suburbs and . children and anyone failing to do that was a failure a communist a beatnik a welfare queen etc. When our discourse treats poverty homosexuality femaleness blackness or the like as a failure to live up to the norm it is easy for privilege to become invisible it makes itself the good and the fair to hide how unjust the structures that support it are.Remember that the existence of gay people was denied for much of the last century and treated as a mental illness when it was acknowledged. Remember race science and colonialism.  If you an I both speak English and on a computer medium we are knee deep in power and privilege because we are intrinsically in the top echelons of global wealth because our access to first world tools is predicated on the existence of a third world that serves our needs and makes our wealth We cannot change this fact but by acknowledging it and by being critical in our political and personal choices we can begin to dismantle the structures that oppress us all.Menrights and the like do not represent a genuine desire for change they never campaign to stop abuse of boys such as the big case that broke in England this summer for instance.  Their whole mission is to oppose feminism and other social justice movements and to defend a status quo where straight white men and only straight white men have privilege and power. When they do point to a legitimate problem e.g. male suicide or the invisibility of male rape they never attribute it to the obvious and pressing cause e.g. men kill themselves because male emotions are stigmatized because in the patriarchy the ideal man is a cold rational being devoid of weakness and feeling or how men arent supposed to ever not want sex so male rape is impossible. etc etc etc.  All problems explicitly and obviously caused by patriarchal gender norms menrights attribute to feminism the intellectual movement criticizing patriarchal gender roles. According to them feminists somehow cause male homelessness and suicide in the course of running suicide helplines and homeless shelters. Feminism is the true object of their hate not male suffering.As such of course SRS hates menrights. They are hypocrites taking a stand against social justice what is to like?

The reason people should be assisted in transition is that it works and so the question is really does amputating a limb on such a person produce positive psychological outcomes not obtainable by a less invasive method?.

4092081,0,t3_37hcqy,gtSo my question is Is it wrong for us to do and enjoy things like animal roleplay and ageplay?If it stays in the bedroom between consenting adults I would personally say no its not wrong. I somewhat agree with uWooglyOoglys last statement though I think their terminology might perhaps be a bit confused. Its the term organic Id take issue with I think they mean that our desires do not arise naturally from our brain without outside interference which is obviously true. I would point out though for the most part they do not develop conciously the best evidence is that the core of patterns of sexual arousal is laid down during childhood and that actually removing sources of arousal in adulthood can be next to impossible. Personally I think that what is important is not the content of fantasies and scenes of roleplay per se its our relationship to them. Its like entertainment and art more generally its at its most potentially damaging when we fail or even refuse to critically engage with it to understand the dynamics and broader cultural forces behind it. It is through critical distance examination that we can ensure the separation of fantasy and reality of person and role and that we can avoid using our sexual activities to reproduce toxic cultural constructs. This doesnt just go for roleplay and kink by the way. I tend to agree with those radical feminists who point out that perhaps the most normalised sort of sexual activity heterosexual vaginal intercourse is among the most bound up with a whole slew of sexist cissexist and heteronormative ideological assumptions.,socialjustice101,crmq0k7,11,t5_2vjn1

Shouldnt you treat them with at least the same nominal respect and compasison etc.?Its not about less compassion or more compassion less respect or more respect. Its about understanding. Im very good at using a map to navigate. My friend who has a learning disability is quite bad at it. For a long time I just texted her addresses like I do with my other friends and then got upset when she got lost or turned up late. So I started meeting her at the subway stop and walking with her from there. Thats not any more compassionate or less compassionate than texting an address to someone but its the thing that works with her own circumstances.Or say you have two friends. A is in the same economic bracket as you B is quite a bit poorer. You can go out to lunch at a moderately nice place with A. But if you extend the same invitation to B theyre going to make excuses and probably make up some nonfinancial reason why they cant go. If you want to socialize with B you might suggest playing board games at your house instead or some other activity that wont cause them financial hardship.And this is the kind of thing that all of us take into consideration all the time in relationships and thats as it should be its understanding that respect and compassion arent onesizefitsall things but things that flex to shape the circumstances. But a big part of privilege is that less privileged peoples lives arent as represented in the media and arent as visible. If you use a wheelchair or if you have a close friend or relative who does then you know exactly how often the bus passes you by rather than stopping to lower the wheelchair ramp people who dont have that experience tend to be much more blas about how easy their city is to navigate by wheelchair. So the club president schedules a meeting in a restaurant without thinking to check whether the venue is wheelchairaccessible and then it turns out its not but its too late to cancel and figure out a different venue and then its Sorry maybe next time... and the person who uses a wheelchair misses out on professional networking opportunities.To call this just a problem of respect or compassion is to ignore the fact that the organizer isnt randomly showing less respect or less compassion to Amelia to Bob to Carol to Don... the person who misses out is the one who uses a wheelchair precisely because they use a wheelchair. ,socialjustice101,cxc4h0j,13,t5_2vjn1

There are reasons that the vast majority of rape victims dont report their assaults.

It really doesnt work that way. As Ixius already pointed out affirmative consent doesnt necessarily mean constantly getting verbal permission.

Also youre absolutely allowed to discuss why someone might feel a certain way. Thats not what you did in the following post. You were blatantly presenting your own completely ignorant opiniongtReactionary In this case someone who thinks society is becoming too SJWery and wants to return to when whether something was racist or not was based on the context of the situation instead of nothing against white people being racist and everything against black people being racist. They flip hard and go in the other direction in an effort to stop the SJWing of society.You blatantly misunderstand what racism is. Racism is something endemic in our culture and not just being mean to someone of a different race. Numerous scientific studies have shown that black people are discriminated against at a level vastly disproportionate to most other ethnicities. Unconscious bias is a real thing. Even people who believe that they arent at all racist do it. As a stronger demonstration of how deeply rooted in our culture it is even black people tend to be unconsciously distrustful of black people.Heres an article on the topic Yes black people can exhibit bigotry towards white people. It happens. But white people dont experience that kind of discrimination in nearly every aspect of their lives. White people are seen as the default kind of person. For example when people are telling an anecdote they almost always mention if someone involved was black but its never mentioned when theyre white unless its absolutely necessary for context.... and no just because some black people were mean to you or you were called a cracker at some point doesnt mean you have an in depth understanding of the black experience.As Dr. Cornell West in case you dont know hes a prominent black professor and racial activist has said he hasnt managed to eliminate ideas of white supremacy from his own thoughts so it would be pretty amazing if the average white people in our culture had done so.PS A reactionary is someone who favors the status quo when it comes to their political opinions and is angered by ideas such as antiauthoritarianism and refuses to seriously consider any concepts that challenge the way they see society.,socialjustice101,cxg15ho,4,t5_2vjn1

Diversification is great but by putting so much importance on the color of someones skin who they sleep with and whats between their legs how is that not perpetuating bigotry? Its the same exact thought process used by bigots that those irrelevant aspects somehow reflect anything about someones capabilities intelligence experience etc.Another example would be something Ive seen a lot as Ive been reading up on the social justice movement. Telling people who arent minorities that their opinion is less valid. Why? Because they havent literally experienced what it is to be a minority? Am I not allowed to speak up about political issues such as wars and the economy because Im not in the military or an economist? Is my opinion about issues related to poverty less valid because Im not currently living in poverty? What does the color of someones skin have to do with their ability to comprehend any issue whether theyve personally experienced it or not?Yes I want a color blind gender blind everything else blind society and how I believe we get there is by not perpetuating those practices. It wont happen overnight but how will we ever accomplish that by doing exactly what the bigots do? Judging people and their experience by the color of their skin who they sleep with and whats between their legs. It seems to me that its common sense if you want to accomplish a demographic blind society stop labeling and judging everyone by those demographics.Of course it offends me when someone judges me based on my race or sexuality and treats me differently because of it and thats why Im so offended by what Ive read in the social justice circles. gtId argue that the various social justice movement is invested in treating minorities better.And theres the problem. Why should we be treated better? Nobody was ever fighting for better treatment they fought for equal treament.Bigots will always exist.

Theyve been protested against by every demographic.Lynchings are no longer common place I cant be arrested because of my sexuality like I couldve just a few decades ago I can marry whoever I want regardless of race or gender weve made huge accomplishments in very short periods of time. We are at a point where almost everyone is treated equally under the law. In the few areas where its lacking progress is actively being made. Progress happens. Enormous progress has already happened. Progress is continuing to happen. What Ive seen within social justice circles inhibits progress. Its taking us back. Its saying that we should be treated better because of our demographics. Its the mirror image of the bigots who think we should be treated worse for the same reasons. How can this possibly help?I find the privilege argument to be bigoted as well. I have a friend who was severely beaten by his father through his whole childhood. As an adult he tries but hes broken. Another friend did a few tours in Iraq. He can barely function. Theyre both white. Conversely a segment of my family not my immediate family is affluent. They are the very definition of privilege. Theyre black. I know the whole institution racism argument but based on this concept of privilege someone would automatically assume myself and the family I mentioned are oppressed and assume the white friends I mentioned are privileged. Theyd be making assumptions about peoples experiences based solely on their physical appearance. How is that not racist? And its not limited to the only examples I gave. Poor white people are just as oppressed as poor black people. Rich black people are just as privileged as rich white people. Edit  something else I find unusual is the amount of college students saying how oppressed they are. If youre in college youre already privileged. It doesnt matter if youre a minority or not. The ability to get a college education is a privilege that unfortunately many still dont have.,socialjustice101,cxnb0c9,3,t5_2vjn1

You never said what mythical fourth choice women get after high school that makes you feel lesser. By all accounts women have all the same choices after high school that men do and get the same consequences for failing as you do. Do you think society looks better on an unemployed woman living with her parents than a man doing the same? Now as for your points feeling that all men have to have the same emotions wear the same kinds of clothes act the same this is a result of Toxic Masculinity In a Patriarchal system men are expected to act a very specific way and are shamed for acting outside the norm and it is a problem in our society. That being said if you want to wear bright colors wear bright colors. If you want to dress in some nonnormative way do it! People will try to shame you ignore them. You claim that men are not empowered to be creative or powerful but I absolutely dont understand how. Every single US president and over  of US Congress people in history were men. Nearly all supreme court justices have historically been men. Law Enforcement officers are mostly men. Most CEOs of major corporations are men. Nearly all famous artists and scientists are men. Also how do you think men have terrifying mutagens that warp their bodies but women dont. Have you seen women going through menopause? Better yet have you seen a woman give birth? Fuck that no offense ladies but I will take an entire sasquatch body of hair to never have to go through child birth.

However the fundamental problem with this is that American neoliberalism if it is possible to personify capitalism is privately terrified of thriving examples of socialism and socialdemocracy because they cast doubt on the necessity of mechanisms that transfer wealth from the poor to the rich. This is why we see USbacked coups in Latin America the enforcement of American interests across the globe elsewhere and why a gentler form of capitalism would not be tolerated within North America.gt  with which many of the rest of Americans do not agree not for racial reasons but simply due to different political philosophies.I dont accept that this is the case.

8755969,0,t3_4zwbwt,I dont know if this is welcomed here or not.  I dont feel like a social justice warrior and I generally dont agree with them.  Im here to read learn and I welcome being challenged on my POV. The colloquial definition of racism is the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.So myself as a successful minority with several successful minority friends dont run into that sort of racism too often in the sense that it will negatively impact our progress in life.  If youre a minority who is competent and capable you can succeed in the US. This wasnt always the case.  It use to be you could be the best in the world and you most likely wouldnt be able to succeed.   Even after the civil rights movement and all the new laws past you still had to be significantly better than your competition to over come the discrimination you faced due to your race. Now in sociology racism is on a societal level rather than an individual level.  So its very rare that a minority will be in power and in todays world in America a minority is not in power.  So while a black business owner can deny a job to a white person based upon the color of their skin despite being illegal where hes using his power its not on the society level.I really cant express in words alone how monumentally stupid this is.  Its incredibly frustrating.  I really like what I imagine SJWs stand for but the execution leaves much to be desired.  Simply saying Systematic racism or using another word than defining it would eliminate so much confusion and so much more progress would be made. You cant have a conversation with someone in the wild and use a commonly used word that you have a jargon definition for and expect them to understand.  It only ends one way.. they understand it as the commonly used definition and think youre a radical racist colloquial definition crazy moronic idiot.  Like look at the sentence Black people cant be racist without context and use the dictionary definition of the word..  Then appreciate the message that sends to the person youre talking too. This is why BLMs policy Oh were not here to teach you social justice is so dumb. There are smart people from all races.  Dumb people from all races. Lazy people from all races.  People are very adaptable and typically can improve or degrade depending on environmental factors.  Sure nature plays a big part but many times not all the times it can be overcome.  The issue in America today is racism in the colloquial meaning hasnt really been a problem.  Sure there is a lot of racists out there but they are typically closeted and too cowardly to act on their feelings.  The ones that are racist and act upon their beliefs are so rare a capable minority isnt going to realize they didnt get a job because they were black because by the time they found out they didnt get the job they already have  other job offers. Today capable black people or any minorities dont need affirmative action or any special considerations. These programs were useful in changing the way society operated after the civil rights movement.The problem with racism sociological in America today we still are suffering from redlining that went on throughout the entire th century.. might still be going on today but I havent seen it.  I know my father had difficulty getting a house in a white neighborhood well after the fair housing act was passed. America is segregated.  You drive through a city like Philly or Hartford its like walls of people.  All you see is white people.. a few blocks down all you see is black people.. another few blocks all you see is Latino.. then Asians etc. etc. Then you have NYPD making it unofficial policy to harass black people... and they are all on the same blocks for their convenience.Then you have the war on drugs which destroys black communities.  The police harass them not because they are black but because they are into drugs.. but the war on drugs was started to demonize blacks and hippies so.. there you go.  The police are unwittingly crucial tools of racism sociological and they dont even know it or have any real power to do anything about it. So now we have communities with kids with single parents or no parents and that puts them at a disadvantage.  Not that single parents cant raise good kids but its way more challenging and statistically not as successful as having  functional parents.  Its hard not to turn to drugs selling or using when youre poor and trying to find something to eat.  Its hard to find a job when you need to travel with public trans or walk... hard to get food when you need to go to a corner store because you dont have a car and the nearest grocery store is a few miles away.  Therefore as a whole America is less likely to produce capable minorities as they are compared to produce capable people who fit into the majority.  There in lies why systemic racism is such a problem. Anyway hope you found this helpful.. it was helpful for me to get my thoughts out.  Normally I just write things like this out and delete them because I dont feel like Im going to gain any new insight or knowledge as a result of an argument etc.  Laid out the  definitions where a lot of the confusion comes from and some of the history and barely touched why things are the way they are in America today at least.  ,socialjustice101,d705kfu,4,t5_2vjn1

The people who advocate for safe spaces see it as a place of comfort for people which I fail to see as university and college is meant to be a challenge. If someone wants to go to a safe space outside an educational institution I would be fine with that even though personally I would not.,socialjustice101,dcaglai,0,t5_2vjn1

10355622,0,t1_dchtyvy,Yeah but easy doesnt necessarily mean bad. It is of course much harder and a much stronger statement to stand up to the sexist traditions of your own culture and if you only break the sexist traditions of other cultures but not those of your own you will come of as a hypocrite. And there is of course a fine line between not respecting sexist traditions of other cultures and condemning an entire culture for having some sexist traditions that you have to be careful not to cross. ,socialjustice101,dchvc0u,3,t5_2vjn1

10678085,0,t1_ddh6v4f,There needs to be a fairly confident link between the policy and the backlash before we condsider taking a step back.Id not considered west african attitudes to mariage being affected by those in the west. If people in west africa are site western decadence then theres certainly seems to be some link. I dont think we should slowind the progress we make in the in the west because people in west africa are responding in a conservative fashion. If people in the US or UK were against marriage reforms to the point that they started to vote in fundamentalist christians then that might be a sign that the population in general were not ready for it yet....and that it might be counter productive to move too fast.The OP also had a problem with the fact such a thought process could be used to argue SJ policies should not be pushed at all. Thats the logical conclusion but we are also continuously arguing debating and persuading. While a policy might be counterproductive today it may not be tomorrow. People views change very slowly but sometimes you notice a sudden shift amongst people caused by an event or or someone with an audience speaking out. Hah Im trying to think of an example and coming up blank.....will have to think on this.Anyhow I think thats how you guage the speed you move at by watching how people are voting how certain ideas are gaining popularity or not.It might feel a bit one step forwards two steps backwards at times but I think it makes sense in certain situations to step back. As you say its highly dependent on each specific topic some issues with popular support could move at a quicker pace others not so much.Two examples...Gay marriage most people are onboard with this and have been for a long time theres not much opposition to this these days.Treatment for paedophiles.....There are supposed to be way more paedophiles around than we could possibly imprison. So really the only solution we have is to invest in finding way to treat them if thats possible. Pushing such a policy would be incredibly unpopular right now any government that made noises about this would likely lose many many votes. It would also open up an area rightwing religious groups could exploit to push other regressive policies should they gain power.Certain events could change popular opinion at some point who knows what or when that might happen though. For me it was watching a documentary about a ward of convicted paedophiles some of them were guilt ridden to the point they were castrating themselves in a DIY fashion. For some its definitely an affliction.....going off topic.,socialjustice101,ddhd3ph,2,t5_2vjn1

11311787,0,t1_dfe29lt,No but heres what does happenA white male hiring manager goes home at the end of a day of interviews and thinks about all the prospective employees he met that day. He narrows it down to three equally qualified candidates Amber Rothman Myquan Jackson and Greg Miller. They all went to great schools and come highly recommended. He just cant decide based on their resumes alone so he thinks back to the inperson interviews from that morning. He thinks to himself Well all these people are clearly qualified but that Miller boy just had something I cant quite put my finger on. He reminds me of myself at that age. I think Ill give him a shot!So hes just shown an implicit bias towards the white male applicant without having a single cruel or discriminatory thought in his head. Hes not a racist. Hes not a sexist. Its just that theres only one opening at the company and he has to make a deciscion somehow. He chose the person he most empathized with. Its not rational but people are not always rational.That scenario is not uncommon and when you multiply it across many companies over many years it results in a majority white male workforce. Thats why some companies have started training their hiring managers to account for thier implicit biases. You cant completely get rid of those thoughts. Its natural to be drawn towards relatable people but you can take a step back and ask yourself why you find someone relatable.And who knows? Its possible he finds Greg Miller relatable because of something that has nothing to do with race or gender but hell never know if hes not trained to ask the question. Thats the thing about implicit biases theyre hidden beneath a layer of completely unrelated explicit thoughts. If youre not trained to think about them you will go your whole life never realizing you have them.,socialjustice101,dfe69a2,13,t5_2vjn1

11314486,0,t1_dfe8ber,Im just gonna briefly go over the timeline of education. Girls arent educated boys are. Educational model of strictness and less activity is normalized.. Girls and boys are educated side by side. Model remains the same.. Girls do better than boys in said model.The model that was constructed when only boys were primarily educated happens to suit girls more. Its really not an example of sexism against boys as much as it is indicative of an old system that happens to be more suited to less hyperactive students overwhelmingly girls.,socialjustice101,dfeh974,4,t5_2vjn1
