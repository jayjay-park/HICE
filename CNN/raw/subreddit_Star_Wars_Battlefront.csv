5348265,0,t3_3o9r58,How Fix The Way TheHeroes Kneel Down When They DieI got the basis for this idea from the youtuber jackfrags on his what he dosent like about battlefront video but i wanted to add more to it.  He said that the way the heroes kneel down when they die was kind of weird and suggested that they force jump off the map when they take enough damage or something to the effect of that.  I think a fix to the problem of the heroes kneeling down when they die they could force jump up into the air and into their respective aerial vehicles Darth a Tie Fighter and Luke a T and fly off.,Star_Wars_Battlefront,cvvauup,3,t5_3a9tf

6016839,0,t1_cy8aw35,They could always have star destroyers and whatever the rebel ships are called fly over the ground battle. This could allow Tie fighter to dock under the star destroyers whilst a huge battle on the ground and sky commences with both players in the star destroyers one man fighters and players on the ground.They wouldnt have to great a open space area but could add these ships with interiors. It may take alot of work but even as separate DLC it would defiantly be worth it and cover DICEs expensives.,Star_Wars_Battlefront,cy8c0z6,2,t5_3a9tf
