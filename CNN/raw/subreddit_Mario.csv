2804022,0,t3_2rssef,To me the two Wii U Mario games so far suffer from a very weird difficulty setup. In NSMBUs case the problem is that the enemy hitboxes are so small that speedrunning through levels is not as easy as before. It is a frustrating day when I need to let go of the running button in order to pass a level or segment. D Mario is just not fun when you are not running.NSMBWii is the same thing yes but the hitboxes are much bigger and therefore running like hell is much more valid and fun,Mario,cnmt32n,1,t5_2qlqx

3388934,0,t3_2yyrpg,Id suggest starting with Super Mario RPG. Its an excellent game with a fun and exciting story and it sets the tone for all the games that follow. It also has some of the best music on the SNES.After that I think youll probably have the most fun if you play them in the order they were released. The Paper Mario series introduces new mechanics in each game and the Mario amp Luigi series gets incrementally more complex. And playing them in order youll go between PaperMampL so neither one will get stale.That said I should mention that the Paper Mario series is all over the place. PM and Thousand Year Door are essential for any Mario fan but the other two are kind of black sheep.Super Paper Mario uses the same RPG mechanics as its predecessors but relies more heavily on the platforming side of the game. If that doesnt bother you then I recommend playing it. It has some pretty funny dialogue and I personally really enjoyed it.Sticker Star is the only Mario RPG Im hesitant to recommend. First its story just isnt quite as interesting as the others. Second the battle system is a significant departure from other games in the Mario RPG series. Its still fun to play but its more like a cardbattle game than a traditional RPG. Its good but its not for everyone.Anyway Im sure youll have a good time with the series regardless of the order you play them. Theyre some of my personal favorites so I hope you enjoy them!,Mario,cpekd1w,2,t5_2qlqx

10658494,0,t1_ddf9rts,Sonic Jam was mainly a compilation though. It collected Sonic    and Knuckles onto one disc. The Sonic World D hub seen in that game was fairly small and while it did feature a few missions to complete it was mainly a means for accessing the collections bonus content the games themselves were accessed from a standard menu. Basically it was Segas way of using what little they had of the original Sega Saturn build of Sonic Adventure before scrapping and rebranding it for the Dreamcast.Really Sonic never really had a true response to Super Mario  as he was largely absent that entire generation. Due to Sonic XTremes cancellation no notable Sonic game releases came out during the Saturns lifespan. Sonic D Blast wasnt truly D at all and was an enhanced port of a Genesis game although the Saturn versions Special Stages are about a million times more fun. Sonic Jam was a compilation that used a small D hub as fluff bonus content. Sonic R was a racing spinoff. The Christmas expansion of Nights into Dreams had an unlockable Sonic mode where you could play the first level and boss as Sonic and while it was technically Sonics first playable D appearance it hardly counts.,Mario,ddfcbyn,2,t5_2qlqx
