Enjoy your baby. One day soon you will realize that your body is going back to normal. Respect what your body has done and what it is still doing.,FitMama,d7n7nts,6,t5_3fe11
9231191,0,t3_56skpc,It sounds like youre in the right track. Calories in calories out is really the best way to lose weight. Be careful while breastfeeding restricting calories too much can affect your supply. Personally I couldnt restrict calories without becoming sooo hungry anyway. I did log food though as it was a good way to keep track of what I was eating and helped me make healthier choices. The other thing that really helped me get active post baby was getting a fit bit. I worked out a lot and was really active pre baby. I havent been able to put in that much time post kiddo and I was sort of all or nothing with regards to working out. The fit bit has helped motivate me to walk more and see patterns with my activity levels. ,FitMama,d8m4d9u,3,t5_3fe11
