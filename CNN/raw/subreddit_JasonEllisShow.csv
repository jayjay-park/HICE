5740576,0,t1_cx8cwy8, makes me feel even better about cancelling my subscription. I had hoped they let people change things up at least a little bit. I remembered k.flay in particular because I had a friend at the time who was really into her EP and passed it on to me. I think musically for me the breaking point was that they played Run the Jewels for what seemed like only a month but Slipknot Marilyn Manson and Foo Fighters are on endless repeat. Whoever programs that hates music andor the days of payola are back.  Its all podcasts like yours Apple Music and my own library for me now. One more question from me Were you fucking with Ellis when you played the M. Shadows stripped vocals also wouldnt be surprised if Ellis andor Katie were fucking him but I hate Avenged Sevenfold and see no other reason anyone would listen to them?,JasonEllisShow,cx8oaem,1,t5_2waao
5753738,0,t1_cx8f9of,Correct me if Im wrong but I took your post as frustrated concern not just Ellis bashing. Personally I feel a connection with the show that I dont get with other programs because Ellis reveals so much of himself on air. Its hard not to start caring about someone you see on a somewhat personal level. And part of caring about someone is calling them out when theyre headed down a bad path demonstrating selfdestructive behavior. ,JasonEllisShow,cxab12v,2,t5_2waao

And when the shoe is on the other foot its get off me and instant dismissals.  days a week would be the end of my listening tenure a true confirmation that there is zero giveadamn left. Im barely hanging on as is.,JasonEllisShow,cxiphos,4,t5_2waao
5961742,0,t3_3wyiu7,Jason and maybe the rest of the cast needs to put down the KoolAid and take note of what people have made mention of here and Im sure on other message boards.Majority of Sterns show is entertaining he has dry spots like any other show but for the most part its a very well put together show that caters to the casual fan and diehard fan.The same cant be said about the Ellis show most days it feels like its been thrown together on a bar napkin and they just whatever the rest.Him trying to include Katie on the show sucks I really dont need to hear a grown man talk about his insecurities all the time. I understand a time and place but hes a total glass cannon emotionally.If he wants his own channel a lot more ground work needs to do done on his end to make it appealing the music on Faction is crap at best it really feels like its about  artists theyll play on rotation and when his show is on the music is even worse. Jason would get decimated  in the mornings as few pointed out already many local FM markets invest heavily on morning radio the AM sports talk crowd or News radio listeners who want local traffic and weather reports what he currently offers now would be ignored.  But thats not even the focal point a large market share of SiriusXM subscribers joined just to follow Stern. Yes Jason has his own market but Im certain if you compare the ratings of both shows it would be apples to oranges.Jasons lack of ratings isnt the fault of SiriusXM Stern Faction or anyone else he wants to point his finger at. Its Jasons fault for continuously providing the same stale content day in and day out.Stern has been able to evolve his show format over time Jason is boobs subpar MMA talk god forbid his Ellis Mania event doesnt sell out immediately thats a two weeks of crying on air and him and Katies sex life. Honestly I really dont care if he as someone in the corner of his room pleasuring themselves while wearing a dog mask thats cool youre into that but I really dont care.Yes Ive taken a massive shit on the show and I know this post will look super negative and the main question will be well why do I listen? Hes on the best time for east coast people driving home from work in traffic with nothing else on.The why not me attitude is on par with a spoiled preteen brat.
