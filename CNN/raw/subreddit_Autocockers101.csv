513156,0,t1_cfy8sqj,i have just heard and seen a lot of negative things about them when they first came out. No personal experience so they might not be as bad as i heard they were. ,Autocockers101,cfylkhi,0,t5_2x5sx
1515649,0,t1_cj45kn1,Are they really leftover bodies? Im not sure how much I believe that. The aluminum in the Psychoballistics bodies is shit compared to a true Dye body.,Autocockers101,cj69hlo,1,t5_2x5sx

10357770,0,t1_dchvzel,They did in fact put jewels on the frames as these ones were made by CCM for the Warped Sports markers which the bodies were not done by CCM.The frames and beavertails were done by CCM added to the Warped bodies with the Angel VA amp regs.So in fact this would not be a correct period frame as like you said the W milled ones would be. The single finger ones would be the first actual style with these double finger spaced one the latter ones with the W milled.I think that the amount of Warped cockers which did not sell or that the deal went sour have never really confirmed which one happened more there was a larger amount of the left over beavertails and the frames with the jewel circle milled at CCM. The Beavertails were held onto for a while and were recently sold but the frames probably were added to whatever markers that were assembled which were non J or the main change in the CCM line. ,Autocockers101,dci43u7,1,t5_2x5sx
