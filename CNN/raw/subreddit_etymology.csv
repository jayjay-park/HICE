3023,0,t3_1u5rl7,The scraps that are put in scrapbooks are so called not because they are unimportant but because they are small and often pieces of a larger thing e.g. something cut from a newspaper. Here is a use of the verb scrapbook by Mark Twain via OEDgt Put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrapbook them.Here Twain is not saying he will create a book but rather put scraps in a book.There are many references to scrapbooks in the th century and many of those make note of the scraps that are placed in them. None of the references talk about the book being made of scraps.Lastly if you were to present someone a book that is made of scraps but contains a normal book inside nobody would call it a scrapbook. But if you had a plain leather bound book containing newspaper clippings and photos people would indeed call that a scrapbook.,etymology,cees5zb,3,t5_2qspe

The ruling elite were the popular kids those who were into school sports and had well developed social skills. Thus the ones they used it against were the kids who focused on academics instead of sports and had poor social skills. This is how the words got their modern definition.Today it has actually taken on a positive connotation.
