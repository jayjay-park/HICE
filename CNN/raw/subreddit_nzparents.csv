4341559,0,t1_cselyml,Basically yes. I think the idea is its useful in an emergency when the normal or previously scheduled people cant do the pick up. You and your kid have an agreed password and you give it to the person who is going to do the pick up.,nzparents,csf0vr4,2,t5_38ken
5280892,0,t1_cvmj4c7,How does the free  hours work?  Is it in public daycare centers or privately run?  Can you child go to the same place for more than  hours and you pay the difference?,nzparents,cvmp1lh,1,t5_38ken
5431272,0,t3_3pebjj,I have a twoyearold.  I hadnt heard of HFM before having kids and neither have my parents. But pretty much everyone I know who has young kids especially those with kids in daycare has heard of it.  I dont know much about it except that I wish there was a vaccine for it.  ,nzparents,cw5wf3p,2,t5_38ken
