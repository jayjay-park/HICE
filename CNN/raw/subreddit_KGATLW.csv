11718514,0,t1_dgobboj,They have their own studio now and theres more money coming in. The hope is that they may be able to remaster the early recordings or not depending how purist one is and do another run of pressings. The demand is certainly there. Thing is they may not even have the original masters for everything. KG are pretty good on maintaining controlownership of all their stuff but unless anyone has info to the contrary this has never been confirmed because really its nobodys business but the bands. ,KGATLW,dgobm9z,1,t5_38w8r
