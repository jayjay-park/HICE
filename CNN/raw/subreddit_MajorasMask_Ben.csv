First while the Terran Federation in Starship Troopers is specifically stated to be a representative democracy Ed Neumeier decided to make the government into a fascist state. This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the th century Western democracies  brought on by social failures at home among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas. In a  interview on The Adam Carolla Show actor Michael Ironside who read the book as a youth said he asked Verhoeven who grew up in Nazioccupied Netherlands Why are you doing a rightwing fascist movie?Dubois elucidates the book s moral position in matters of war whereas Fleet Sergeant Ho s monologues examine the nature of military service and his antimilitary tirades seem primarily in contrast with Dubois. Later it becomes apparent that his attitude and display of truncated limbs are intended to scare off unmotivated applicants. Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico s History and Moral Philosophy course which reveal that the rights of a full Citizen to vote and hold public office must be earned through voluntary Federal service. Those who do not perform this Service retain the rights of free speech assembly etc. but cannot vote or hold public office.A common complaint about Starship Troopers is that it glorifies war along with the military. There was a twoyear debate in the Proceedings of the Institute for TwentyFirst Century Studies PITFCS that was sparked by a comparison between a quote in Starship Troopers that the noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war s desolation paraphrase of the fourth stanza of The StarSpangled Banner  and the antiwar poem Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen. Dean McLaughlin called it a booklength recruiting poster. Alexei Panshin a veteran of the peacetime military argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life and that the Terran FederationArachnid conflict existed simply because Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do.November  Berkley Publishing Group paperback ISBN  November  Berkley Publishing Group paperback ISBN   Ace Books paperback  pages ISBN   Buccaneer Books hardcover ISBN   Blackstone Audiobooks cassette audiobook ISBN XRico is promoted to squad leader and befriends Ace Levy. So I m going to make a perfect fascist world everyone is beautiful everything is shiny everything has big guns and fancy ships but it s only good for killing fucking bugs! You d think a human race capable of interstellar travel might have developed an effective insecticide but no. It features new characters with Rico now a General playing a supporting role. Defending Heinlein George Price argued that Heinlein implies first that war is something endured not enjoyed and second that war is so unpleasant so desolate that it must at all costs be kept away from one s home..   ,MajorasMask_Ben,cx9ticq,1,t5_2w30a
