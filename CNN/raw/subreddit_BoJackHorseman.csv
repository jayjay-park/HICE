4591725,0,t3_3dln58,Bojack will never be happy untill he stops trying to fill his unhappiness with other people  namely the women in his life. Hes always looking for more. More than what he already has  despite having everything most people could want. The perfect example of this is Todd.  Todd likes bojack for who he is  despite being completely fucked over by him all the time. Case in point  his rock opera  not bailing him out of prison and not going to his graduation for improv. Todd accepts bojack for the person he is but bojack has never verbally acknowledged their friendship untill the season  finale which is his first step towards bettering himself rather than crutching  onto what he thinks will make him happy.Predictions for season   bojack wasnt trying to have sex with penny  Charlotte walked in at the worst possible time when she fell  knocking the lamp over  and tried to undo his bowtie. Bojack realized he had already fucked up by trying to kiss Charlotte and didnt think clearing the air was worth it  penny tells her mother the whole story and Charlotte reaches out to bojack apologizing for being such a dick to him despite him deserving it because of how gentle she is.Diane and Mr peanut butters  mairage falls apart  Diane and bojack kiss and or sleep together. Bojack will either try to start a relationship with Diane which will ultimately fail due to their respective flaws or he will reject her incredibly unlikely imo and they will both be forced to grow as people. Season  will end with bojack realizing he cant keep trying to find a woman who will make him happy because no matter how great they are  they cant fix him. He is unfixable... to others. The only person who can change bojack is bojack and he will either realize this and better himself through acceptance or continue to spiral to an early grave via suicide or alcohol poisoning. Which in his mind would parellel with the series finale of horsing around where he died because he wasnt loved enoughEdit herb also faked his death.

8476353,0,t3_4v826v,Bojack will not kill himself. Remember all the predictions for the end of Mad Men like DB Cooper and Don Draper killing himself by jumping from the building?I think Bojack being a show dealing with similar themes will end on a similarly hopeful note Bojack will accept that nobody really likes him because he has been an asshole that just because he had a rough childhood with shitty parents doesnt excuse his behavior that at some point he became responsible for how he acts and cant keep running from it in women food and drinking. He will acknowledge that he is an asshole and that he deserves to be alone and yet somebody will come to him at the end. Maybe Todd maybe his daughter maybe Diane or Mr. Peanutbutter and maybe all of them. Bojack has finally realized himself he has reset to zero he has crashed and rebooted and now he can better than he was he can be the person who deserves the friend and relationships he only had due to his position. Just like Don Draper accepted that his personality was what sank all of his relationships with women with his children colleagues and everybody else Bojack will too he will have a huge revelation an inner realization and find his CocaCola commercial. He will realize he is the man in the refrigerator. ,BoJackHorseman,d6133um,2,t5_2zzfr

Showing up on time. Actually getting up out of fucking bed. And eventually all the shit life throws at you or the stuff you would throw at yourself will cause one to spiritually wear down and break. And when one does break they fuck up big time. Also it takes away from any good thing one would do.because selfloathing would find a flaw or anything to devalue any good action you would do.

9771204,0,t3_5f492k,A meta joke would be when the show makes a joke inuniverse that refers to the real show itself.An example of this is the dreamstate conversation Bojack has with Cuddlywhiskers as Cuddlywhiskers says something along the lines of we need a guest star someone people like maybe Sarah Lynn. This joke is meta because it works on two levels. Firstly this conversation occurs in Bojacks life and we see the result of it when he goes to Sarah Lynn in her dressing room with the script. Thats the inuniverse part. The meta part of the joke is that its also referencing the fact that while they were writing the show they felt like they needed to throw in an interesting character like Sarah Lynn.Please tell me if you need more clarification.,BoJackHorseman,dahimld,18,t5_2zzfr

So far episode  was my absolute favorite so far. All the beyonce references! What I really love about this show is all the small things. You gotta really pay attention to catch it all. Like in ep  theres this shot where everyone is looking at their phone while the D is being brought back and theres a hippie with a shirt that says my other car is a tree. And in ep  when Princess Carolyn goes to the gym theres a sloth just hanging lazily on the treadmill. And that Princess Carolyn has a cat toy on her desk. Also I think that this show has the absolute best themesong.Ill post a review when Im actually done with the first season.

She obviously has a great deal of interest in him but it doesnt seem to be a sexual interest...
