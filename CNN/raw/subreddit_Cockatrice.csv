200176,0,t1_cf163ex,Im almost done with it. Others have been released but I dont trust them so Im making my own. However I probably should trust them and just copypaste someone elses work. If you want to help once they go live on gatherer start adding images with me to the collective file. Ill upload the BNG only text file once Im done with it.,Cockatrice,cf18q92,1,t5_2vk8b

1318261,0,t1_cihwzak,I mean Im not personally complaining but I did want to bring it to your attention that if you were the one who made that happen it would have been better for the playerbase at large if you kept that under the table.

1797193,0,t1_ck5oefy,I dont understand. Did that solve your problem? if not launch oracle.exe and mark the sets you want delete again the downloadedPics folder and launch cockatrice.Remember whenever you update cockatrice or the card database launching oracle.exe you need to delete your downloadedPics folder.,Cockatrice,ck5onh7,1,t5_2vk8b

2264875,0,t3_2l4b6i,Tried Command  W?  It shouldnt look that way youve definitely encountered a bug.  Relaunching doesnt fix it?The answer below about getting a PC is wrong.The real answer is The best way to run Cockatrice is compiling from source off the Cockatrice GitHub page.  Preferably in a Linux environment that you also compiled yourself.A side note on OSX as a pseudoUNIXYou are in luck that youre in an environment that is friendlier than windows when it comes to attempting to compile code like this from source.  You will likely break everything if you dont know what youre doing but you will need a package manager like Brew as a means to install dependencies then at least most of the following packages I think theres a few I didnt need just pulled it from my bash history.Also bear in mind my system is Debian Linux with aptget. YMMV qtmobilitydev libprotobufdev cmake qtqmake qtdevtools protobufccompiler protobufcompiler libprotobufdev libprotocdev protobufcompiler libgcryptdev I think this one is only necessary for servatrice the Cockatrice server application.If youre mostly nontechnical check diligently for newer versions of the client installer for OSX.,Cockatrice,clrnpgf,3,t5_2vk8b

2567323,0,t3_2p5sk5,I would love to do this but the problem is that its all voluntary. Id love to see some kind of implemenation like xmage has where it automatically loads the next game against your next opponent but that takes coding time and testing. Ive never tried it but you may get at least one more round if you create a draft and call it something like KTK SWISS.  Then try to let people in the draft know that their round  opponent must have the same wl record.  ,Cockatrice,cmtor5o,1,t5_2vk8b

5042094,0,t3_3k0850,Currently its not possible but I think it might be worked on right now and possible in the near future. You can however set all your island to the same image by either using the CUSTOM folder or rearranging your sets in the deck editor.,Cockatrice,cutrhpo,5,t5_2vk8b

5265713,0,t3_3n3vhe,Connection timed out wouldnt indicate an out dated client.  It means that when trying to talk to the the server you have put in for registration that it is never reached. Start by making sure the server name you are trying to register is typed in correctly along with the port information.  Also make sure there is nothing blocking your connection between you and the server over that port such as malwareantivirus protection software or firewalls.You may want to make sure the name of the server you are trying to register to is resolving to the correct IP address.,Cockatrice,cvkr4ze,1,t5_2vk8b
