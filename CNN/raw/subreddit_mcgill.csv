949768,0,t3_24y6rq,Frankly everything else youve already heard here is right  a lot of students at McGill  especially in the Faculty of ScienceArts and Science Program and especially first and secondyear students  say theyre planning on medical school. Very few ever actually applyare accepted and even fewer immediately following undergrad. If youre going to be one of the few that actually followthrough you need to plan your time at McGill carefully. Im assuming you have no advanced standing which Im assuming for convenience based on the fact that youre a U. In the multitrack program you have an  credit Arts major concentration   credit Science major concentration might be  with labs   credit integrative course BASC    credit U Program. This brings you to about  credits depending on labs and such. That leaves you with about  creditsaround  courses to squeeze in everything you need that is beyond your major. Depending on how broadly you plan to apply and considering the new subjects included on the MCAT it is essential that you plan your degree  what classes will you take and when?  Check some med admissions sites and see what courses you may need to take as electives to ensure youre prepared. For Bio and Anthro this probably means Organic  stats maybe another English course if you take a language in your first year maybe a psychology course etc. There is no such thing as a premedpreprofessional advisor here so a lot of this legwork is stuff youre best off doing on your own. My advice take at least one English course as a part of your U Freshman program make a plan for the rest of your degree and bring it to your advisor before you register for your U courses to ensure that A. what you plan on doing is reasonablepossible and B. what you plan on doing will actually lead to a degree. Dont ask me what advisor you should see  ArtSci is notoriously frustrating on that front with the notable exception IMO of the interfaculty programs advisors. The details of whatever plan you come up with will probably have to be modified on a yeartoyear basis because of scheduling conflicts for example but having a general framework is useful.Finally as a recovering premed you should be prepared to really work but dont get stuck on this as the only thing that you should be focusing on or your only shot for a happy future. The second I stopped focusing on med school I found my schoolwork more enjoyable and my GPA went up as a consequence. After years of GPA anxiety I decided to postpone my AMCAS application last June and I was in a better mental headspace and academic place this year. I was in class to learn about cool stuff not just to get an A or the best grade I could manage so I could move along to the next thing. Its good to have a goal but especially in the Arts and Science program youll be expected to explore interests other than medicine. TLDR Plan your degree. Do it by next March. Everyone is premed their first year dont let that go to your head too much.,mcgill,chc8vpr,6,t5_2rhkw

When a prof wants a number of TAs they go to the chair and see if its in the departmental budget.On one hand theres the issue of pay in affordability but in some departments they need to have a set amount of TAs for the courses with higher enrollment so theres TA positions regardless. And some courses dont need TAs the smaller higher level courses. And the department is the one who decides which and how many TA positions are available. AGSEM just makes sure everyone gets the same amount which is fair to all students and takes into account the rate of inflation.,mcgill,chxtsed,2,t5_2rhkw

However the MathCS major has been around for quite a while. As a matter of fact Henri Darmon a MathCS McGill alumni is the Honours adviser and knows his shit pretty well. I dont know who is the adviser for the major program. Im not sure how PhysicsCS is more applicable to be honest.I highly recommend MathCS either the honours or major version.

1612667,0,t3_2cs36n,I took Honors Microeconomics and Honors Economic Statistics last year and plan on continuing with the program. The main difficulty in Honors Economics is the extremely mathheavy syllabus. Economics may be a social science but the focus in the Honors courses is not on the economic theory of how people participate in the market but on building the skills necessary to do well in an analytic Economics positionprimarily an academic grad school or professorship position or an economic researcher position at say the Fed or the ECB or the World Bank.I would still suggest taking Honours Economics if you want at all to go into the actual field of economics as an analyst or researcher. The firstyear courses are alternately inane and confusing and honestly Ive been totally turned off by academic economics because of my experience last year in my courses but I do want to stick it through. The skills you learn in Honors Economics that you miss out on if you go the Majors route are absolutely invaluable for any sort of STEMtechnical position and you can always transfer out if you absolutely want to both at the end of Fall semester and at years end. The professor quality for first year is honestly pretty bad. Out of the four professors I had for Microeconomics S and S and Economic Statistics S and S only one of those professors Rohan Dutta was praised by the students outside of class. Licun Xue was unintelligible and unhelpful during office hours John Galbraith was esoteric and obscure and too busy to be invested in the course and Victoria ZindeWalsh was scatterbrained and generally fit for retirement.If you decide to go through with this I suggest finding and befriending one of the Math majors since for them the whole Honors Economics program is a bird major or convening a study group as soon as possible. Doing this will absolutely help you do better in the course especially if you put in the effort to understand and internalize the various economic processes you learn about.,mcgill,cjifz6r,8,t5_2rhkw

2103582,0,t1_cl6zi76,As probably the only person on here who has gone to both McGill and a school in the states its about the same as top tier schools here. College is hard if you make it hard and easy if you make it easy. AeroAstro is gonna be hard everywhere. McGill is big enough to have a culture for anyone if you look hard enough as with American state schools. I drank a heck of a lot more in Canada than here cuz the drinking age is  years lower and the people I ended up hanging out with happened to like drinking. Im not saying McGill isnt harder than  of US schools and not saying that it holds your hand at all. Just that if you compare McGill to the top  of American schools its gonna be about the same. And I do miss the poutine.Biggest difference McGill doesnt grade on a curve for better or for worse.edit on the topic of AAE I work in an aeroastro lab at the University of Washington which has close enough ties to the largest airplane company in the world that . the AA department is named after William Boeing and . Tours of the Seattle Boeing plant are standard curriculum even outside the AA department and . Boeing engineers are routinely brought in as guest lecturers.

2459092,0,t3_2noqg0,Not too sure what youre looking for in terms of a description of the history department but here goes my best attempt as a rd year history major... Most of the profs are helpful but like many other departments many prioritize their research over teaching so I would only recommend history if you dont mind doing a great deal of learning and work by yourself. Like any field of study or work networking is key whether youre in a large or small course making the extra effort to connect with and get to know the prof can make all the difference in your mark for the course or even your future academic career.I do like how history is taught at McGill especially compared to what Ive heard about other universities but avoid large classes at all costs and try to get through the intros and prereqs as quickly as possible these classes are very easy but extremely boring and disengaging at least for me. The upper level seminar type courses tend to be the best and if you enjoy researching specific topics you will have a chance to shine. My focus has been on modern European history though with a handful of courses on the classical world Latin America and Asia. Although Im definitely biased in favor of history as an arts program I cannot help but feel its standards and methods of research are often more in depth and selfcritical than other social sciences and liberal arts. Memorization of facts and dates becomes an almost useless skill in favor of critical analysis so you better like writing papers over short answer or multiple choice exams which become almost nonexistent in upper level courses. I didnt have any trouble being accepted as a U arts student due to my grades and test scores if youre coming from the US its good to know that McGill does not take into account essays or extracurricular activities on its application but you probably already know this. ,mcgill,cmfn91b,5,t5_2rhkw

2530744,0,t1_cmnch8u,Hi Woozer Thanks for the comment! Typically students are entitled to a maximum of  sessions per school year at our service. However sometimes therapists will end treatment early because they feel the therapy work has been completed.  This is up the clinical judgment of the therapist though you should feel free to seek a second opinion. You are always encouraged to be assertive and advocate for yourself. I understand your concerns and certainly there is a role for longterm psychotherapy. However  studies show that shortterm therapy less than  sessions is as effective as longer term therapy. The duration of effective therapy varies with each individual. But for the majority of patients at our service who tend to present with depression andor anxiety  sessions is recommended according to the current evidence on talk therapies.

Although as anyone in math can tell you the difference is very little and neither option will prepare you well for grad school.However Honours and Joint Honours Math are exactly the same in both Arts and Science.

And yeah with the proper prerequisites no student who is appropriate for their program should fail any course six times. You can seriously memorize the exam structure and pass the next time. He uses assignment questions on every exam. I dont think thats unfair its a professional degree with strict standards.

6330895,0,t1_cz98nq5,gt slow down there we want this? i didnt get the memo.Yes? Its called not being a shitty person. McGills community was very welcoming to me when I was applying and in my first year which was a big help. I want to extend that welcome to other students who are in the same situation as I was just a few short years ago.Yeah I mean I agree that it gets a painful seeing the subreddit as more of a helpdesk than anything else. This is especially painful with simple factual questions that people at Service Point are paid to answer  like what happens if I fail or I have a GPA of X will I get in?. We get a lot of questions here that dont fall into that category which are fine and IMO should be encouraged  questions like should I choose prof Y or prof Z for this class or which program should I sign up for if my interests are A B and C.I think a simplified QampA system like a recurring Simple Questions Thread in other smaller subreddits would be better for addressing the helpdesk nature without alienating newcomers. There are the occasional student life threads that are active and upvoted  theres no reason why you or anybody else cant post more. Meetups are fun too since we dont end up actually talking about McGill much. SSMU drama is a bit stale for my taste but those threads are popular and frequent.Side unrelated rmcgill rant because fuck it threads about contemporary issues here get super neckbeardy so I stay the fuck away. Inactive nonMcGill users tend to come out of the woodwork to turn McGill issues into issues about ethics in video game journalism or how feminism is basically fascism or the police state of censorship because some mod deleted a racist comment. It ends up being a drama filled clusterfuck that never really has anything to do with McGill and may not belong here.,mcgill,cz994i2,14,t5_2rhkw

If feminism was an explicitly religious ideology based revelations and a Holy Book written by the creator of the universe which should be considered the Truth... and they claimed nonfeminists to be inherently inferior I wouldnt be a bigot to criticize feminism as a whole.  I mean I could still criticize the general instantiation of feminism or Islam regardless of the fact that Islam is coded doctrine.  How else can we talk about the validity of certain sets of beliefs other than their generalized instantiation in human brains?  If AltRight beliefs generally lead to hatred of Jews Id say their bad beliefs.  I dont see how the vast majority of Muslims being homophobic or antisemitic doesnt spark the same intuition in your head?  I mean they believe the literal reading which explicitly states infidels to be subhuman they also rank the different religions below Islam! cool!.  Islam is explicitly and implicitly divisive and hateful.  Its also obviously based on false beliefs.  Since when are ideas that are explicitly hateful divisive and wrong in any way not bad just because enough people espouse them?  How large of a cult does Scientology need to become before you start defending its ideology?  What about nazism?  What about white nationalism?  And if you tell me Islam isnt shitty because you dont take the hateful divisive parts seriously well then whatever most people in the world call Islam is shitty.

10417421,0,t1_dcosyut,Haven taking online courses at my previous university I understand the tremendous benefits of online courses. Youre free to complete tasks at your own pace so long as you meet deadlines. You dont have to attend lectures at fixed times unless the course is designed otherwise. You dont even have to be in the same city or country as the university to complete an online course you can just go to a designated exam centre in your city to write an exam. This allows flexibility for instances when you have to take a reduced workload due to illness or cant be in Montreal but still want to maintain your student status. Obviously there are shortcomings to online courses. Its very easy to be distracted and lose your sense of time management. You get a lot less guidance since online courses tend to be teach yourself out of the book. I dont see why McGill is so reluctant since online courses would increase tuition revenue since youd have more distance studies students taking courses for interest or for transfer credits and promote digital literacy in both students and professors. Much of the infrastructure eg. online portals like MyCourses is already in place so it shouldnt take a lot of effort to implement them. You might have to hire a couple of IT technicians and train some professors and TAs but thats just about it. ,mcgill,dcovsky,11,t5_2rhkw
10418122,0,t3_5o1pcv,When you say live on campus Im not sure what you mean as there are residences and houses that surround campus but nothing in the actual campus itself. The U of C campus is much more spread out and it is a commuter school McGill is not. I would say  of those I meet are not from montreal and live within walking distance to the university. Also for communal kitchens I do not know if any on campus that you can have access to if you are not in residence. However if you are in residence each rez will have some area but in my experience it was infrequently used. Again just my experience but I would say most people who live outside of residence buy or prep lunch and bring it with them.Moreover with everyone living so close I would say it is likely easier to get closer with friends that you meet at McGill. The universities centrality makes clubs and teams going for drinks a common occurrence and the abundance of cafes and activities allows for more interaction with those people you meet than typical in a commuter school as people typically live close by. Again social activits off campus are quiet common and most groups will have  throughout the semester. Fundamentally I think the U of C is largely lacking this people live far and commute in so finding friends hat also live in your area and can schedule events with is noticeably harder. McGills centrality and large portion of students living near campus really makes this a much smaller issue in my opinion. ,mcgill,dcoynlr,2,t5_2rhkw

10678997,0,t3_5sqgom,I took BIOL  with Leon Glass a couple years ago. To put this in context Glass is now almost  years old and has been teaching the same class at mcgill since the s he wrote the textbook himself and the course is insanely outdated like the textbook recommends FORTRAN outdated but hes a good lecturer passionate about what he does and he was relevant in the s and has published around  papers so hes still teaching. A super nice old man.So after taking the deferred final I was sick its early summer I work at Bellini about  min away from his office in McIntyre so I decide to pay him a visit to look at my essay and hopefully get some feedback on it.So I barely got an A in the class like . mostly due to my good score on the essay as I did rather poorly on the final and the midterm. So I show up to his office give him my name he finds my essay and nows the thing. The guy REFUSES to believe I wrote that essay. I have a rather heavy francophone accent a lot more so back then than now this was when I just started doing research and actually speaking English with other people at mcgill and he doesnt recognize me at all because I skipped over half the lectures and always sat in the back and never said anything. He takes out his s cellphone and CALLS the TA who shows up  min later. The prof asks the TA if he recognizes me the TA says no. So he starts asking me questions about the content of my essay and even though it was written almost  months ago I kind of convince them that I did write it.So then he looks sad and starts asking me why I didnt attend lectures and start telling about his plummetting reviews and how he feels like people dont have the same interest for math as they did  years ago and sometimes he feels like retiring but on the other hand he really likes teaching.So we have this conversation in which I end up apologizing for not showing and telling him that I really appreciated the lectures and felt like I got a LOT out of the class which is true and to not think too much of the reviews because the class was not as hard as people pretended and undergrads nowadays can be a bit entitled and react badly to classes that are a bit different from others and that it was one of the more interesting classes Ive taken many universities dont have that kind of course for biology students. Then we talked a bit about what I was interested into about the new horizons for interdisciplinary biology and all that new stuff going on that he didnt fully follow but he did say that he was happy that people were still interested in discovering new theoretical models for biological systems.And since then Ive been recommending his class to pretty much everyone because this tiny old man is the nicest most concerned for students prof Ive met at mcgill. Yes the class is outdated but its still great to open horizons about math in biology and it really inspired me to start doing research in interdisciplinary biology.,mcgill,ddhghi9,22,t5_2rhkw

Nor is it ok to accuse someone of lying when they say hold on with your accusations of me being a rapist Ive been a victim of sexual assault too.No I am a victim of sexual assault does not mean that this person is right or that their argument must be sound but accusing them of lying is as shitty as having other people disregarding you.Tldr both parties are committing mistakes IMO,mcgill,deuojq3,2,t5_2rhkw
11177971,0,t1_deytmws, I think the mandate of a Finance Committee would be too broad and that the time of our amazing staff and volunteer committee members could be used more wisely as they wouldnt be able to get their hands dirty. In short I am hesitant as I do not see the value of having a committee for the sake of having a committee. There is currently a committee assigned to each of the primary parts of the VP Finances portfolio Funding Financial Ethics and Research Health and Dental all of which have seats for Members at Large. That being said since you have flagged this as a point of interest I will now be looking into models of Finance Committees at other institutions to see if striking one would align with our current structure. However our Board of Directors Finance Committee largely fills the space of overall financial oversight and it also has seats for Members at Large. I hope to also create a working group or committee of sorts to research avenues for our longterm social sustainability.

11564241,0,t3_64t5mb,I took AI with him last semester. Read about all the negative reviews and turns out he wasnt THAT bad. He had a flipped classroom approach which means you had to do the readings beforehand or else you couldnt keep up with the material in class. I thought his teaching was totally fine but the workload was pretty intense imo. It certainly wasnt an easy class but I learned a lot and while he wasnt my favorite professor he certainly wasnt the worst either. ,mcgill,dg6t8lh,1,t5_2rhkw

11667550,0,t1_dgiex7k,Yes you can have fun. No you wont be left out. From the comments on this sub and online you might get the impression that McGill is all about drinking. Sure if you want to make your university experience like that its entirely possible to center your social life around drinking events. However a bunch of committees dedicate a lot of time in organizing events that arent drinking focused. From my anecdotal undergrad experience most people like partying in moderation. Everyone likes potlucks. Everyone loves going to parks. The beauty of university is that you can do whatever you want and theres so many social networks that exist that there will always be one for you. Protip on making friends at McGill.Dont be an asshole.Create your own opportunities to make friends University is not a TV show  you will certainly not bump into your bestfriend drop all the textbooks you both were holding and laugh blindly about how late you will be. You cannot simply go to class and study all day and expect to make friends. Join clubs societies anything that interests you. Following step  helps..Be openminded.Be friendly.Dont be an asshole,mcgill,dgij66j,9,t5_2rhkw

11794151,0,t1_dgwda18,Having TAedcourse assistant classes since nd year until the end of my degree one thing that has become clear to me is that undergrads will always complain and will rarely take it upon themselves to use other resources to learn. They take the easy way out and blame the professor for not adequately explaining a topic. Admittedly schedules are pretty tight but its really important to learn the fundamentals well Ive seen too many times students will forget everything from a class after they pass it only to get wrecked by a class down the line which uses the tools developed in previous classes extensively. ,mcgill,dgwwnou,6,t5_2rhkw
