3802597,0,t3_33lxdv,This is NOT official i repeat this is NOT official. It was made by a fan by the name of Bill Mudron. Hes a very talented fan artist but his work is just that fan art and should not be treated as official.,Marioverse,cqpq5nn,1,t5_37y0b
3807555,0,t1_cqqa5nj, The only map of the mainland perhaps. I saw uWakkadoo mapped out the islands from DKC which will help a lot.Im just trying not to be too overbearing. As much as Id love to tell everyone in no uncertain terms exactly where everything should go I probably shouldnt. ,Marioverse,cqqai8a,1,t5_37y0b
7114972,0,t1_d1mva75,I didnt mean that the airport is on the Turtle Archipelago but rather on islands beyond it.    Tomorrow night Ill be able to post a map sketch where the bottom corner islands and the location of Sunshine Airport is actually South of Dry Dry Desert which in turn is West of Rougeport. This would put Isle Delfino directly South of Rougeport. I think this could work with the rail map as well. Ill try to post it before midnight Swedish time. ,Marioverse,d1mvqcb,1,t5_37y0b
7217749,0,t1_d1yhp9f,Thanks! After the giant map I made before so I realized that breaking it down into sizable chunks might be easier to handle especially those that are known to be islands. Then later on Ill revise the giant map with these as basis.     Im thinking of doing the Northern Kremisphere next ,Marioverse,d1yloxp,1,t5_37y0b

Zelda isnt the pushover Peach is and would give the king koopa a beating hed never forget. Perhaps hed even withdraw from the Mushroom Kingdom haha. However Id dont think Peach gets the appraisal she deserves. She is one of the seven star children and while wisdom might not be an attribute most commonly applied to her I do think theres more to Peach than meets the eye. I really like this theoryanalysis by Gajin Goomba In short Peachs powers correlates rather well with a superpowered Japanese goddess which is kept in line by the nonstop appraise by the toad who do love her unconditionally. This keeps her powers from getting out of hand and lets the status out of hand. This power balance is disturbed in games where a villain other than Bowser comes and tries to change things. Peach steps into action until status quo is reestablished.    Combine this with the theory of Peach allowing herself to be kidnapped as it is the most efficient way of protecting the lives of her loyal subject and Peach just might seem a bit more like Zelda in pure power measure. That theory is very nicely complemented by a comment in the same thread explaining Mario and Luigis stance on the matter.        Ugh there is so much to talk about here Im loving the other topics youve given but I dont have time right now! Stupid need to sleep!,Marioverse,dbqfnui,2,t5_37y0b
