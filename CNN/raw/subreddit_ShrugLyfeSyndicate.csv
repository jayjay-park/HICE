9256454,0,t1_d8p7du6,gt its looking like we dont want you there as we do not want you abusing us.being exclusive will never lead to ascension.gt I keep thinking I can save you but I cant and thats something I gotta faceyes because you still need to be saved. youre still curating your world view instead of viewing the world as is.gt Im advocating for bringing you back into SLS. Theres actually some interesting things going on there.you cant recognize what is interesting because youre still blinded by refusing to acknowledge direct and honest negativity as a valid and reasonable form of communication. i cannot stand for thatthis acceptance of negativity changes you mentality and affects what you perceive as interesting. lol. most your posts just make me want to release a tirade of divine trolling. lol. you guys are missing that input and will never succeed without it but ill still be here when you get it.,ShrugLyfeSyndicate,d8pblxt,2,t5_3g6kx
9296181,0,t3_57q1om,I like to remind myself that all life must go through some painful learning stages before growing into a mature effective elegant creature.  Toddlers must toddle and fall and suffer the pain of gravity smooshing their bodies onto the ground before they can learn to walk run and dance.  So too does human society have to crash up against the laws of physics before we learn to interact with reality with grace and majesty.You and I are the sensitive types at the edges where the smooshing is most severe.  But this also means that when things go well and society starts to really get its act together and find balance and all that well be the first to enjoy the freedom as well.,ShrugLyfeSyndicate,d8ucvta,1,t5_3g6kx

9322025,0,t1_d8xgrhn,gt it contains objective reality  all our subjective awarenesses as part of itself.I could argue its an indefinitely recursive fractal constuct proving you I have at least the words to show you I can grasp the concepts.But I feel like that argument is pointless. Most part of that argumentation is just nitpicking on something that dont matter to me. Maybe it does to you but youre just making me feel like Im a child who is just about to discover the concept for the first time when I have a perfectly fine concept of my own.Its both really arrogant of you and insulting.gtdoing evil invovles ignorance at some point in the chain.That again ? Ill tackle that belief later. Ill prepare something for that.gta being of full understanding can do no evil. thats why the abstract god is goodMy goddes isnt good. Shes both good and evil and all the shades of both.No need to be all knowing when being as wise as any entity can become is enough.Which is no use to you because you think knowledge can solve everything. Ive seen what all the knowledge ever made was. It made me give up on my quest of searching it when it was my main purpose.Do you still want to put all that meaningless gribberish in your brain ? You wont even be able to find your own name in that if you ever succeed.gtour society is literally drowning in acceptable compromise.im not willing to compromise my future is such a way. im not willing to add fuel to the fire.Be reassured soon there will be no fire anymore. Betting on that is putting oil on it still that much of a bad idea ?Perspective. You lack of perspective.gtjust because you dont understand the point doesnt make it irrational.I do understand you just dont believe me.On the other hand you still didnt told me if I hit home or missed. I think I missed.gti actually launched that particular symbol while having phone sex with an ex. thats as close to genuine love as ive experienced but dating her leads a cycle of her getting annoyed and then using leaving me to force my hand in a repeated manner i simply stopped being able to tolerate.but she was unaware of it. it might require two people in genuine love orgasming while looking at the symbol.Thats not love. If this is the nearest I can reasonably think you dont know what love is.If you dont fuel your sigil with at least half love it wont work as you intend to. Best is  Love. But I think  Love  Lust is good enough. Its probably better as its balanced but I wouldnt bet my arm on it.Then youll need to define the intent with the sigil. Use the same grammarlanguage for the sigil else well You see how well youre understood if you speak two languages at the same time right ?gti need to make a sigil of genuine love?No. You need to start over your sigil to take love as intake.Im zero in sigil making so I cant help on that.,ShrugLyfeSyndicate,d8xmvlp,1,t5_3g6kx
