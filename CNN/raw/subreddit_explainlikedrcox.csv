Because the government is in everything. Eheeverything. And as at least a quarter of a doctor you should know this better than anyone!Libertarianism is based on the founding principle of what is right in the name liberty. Freedom! Now that sort of sounds like something the Found Fathers would have been jawing off about wouldnt it?But right now in this moment in time you cant even do a line of coke or take a puff of the reefer without every cop within ten square miles trying to break down your door. Now is doing either of those things stupid? They sure are newbie. But when you put them up against the liberty of being able to have a sixth of scotch in one hand a cigarette in the other and a rifle clasped between your meaty thighs it does start to seem a little bit odd doesnt it?But as the old saying goes newbie give a man a steak and hell eat for a day. But teach a man to hunt and well...Hell have to get a gun so he has to go get a permit for the gun. He has to observe the waiting period. He has to get a job to buy the gun. And a safe storage area for the gun. And read up on his local gun laws that change from state to state. And then he has to get a permit to hunt animals. And make sure he doesnt go over his limits. And make sure hes not hunting illegally on sacred ground. And make sure hes shooting the right kind of deer at the right time of year.And is it really any surprise that a movement about freedom from the government might just maybe be gaining traction?In closing newbieWhen you finally do find the right man to get down on one knee and sweep you off your feet and you finally birth life from the portable hell contained in your ovaries and that little kid grows up just old enough to start wanting to make lemonade...Well that precious little child is going to need to take governmentapproved courses on food preparation and serving and get a permit to sell to the public or shes going to be committing a crime.,explainlikedrcox,cjm0de1,-6,t5_2wsv9
