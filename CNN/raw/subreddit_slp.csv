394138,0,t3_1xi4np,It is VERY good that you are asking this question now. I always say that I had very little idea of what I was getting into when I majored in speech pathology. I was lucky since I still like it but shadowing before picking the field would have been a really good idea before such a big decision.As people have mentioned already there are a variety of setting that you can work in but the  most common are schools and skilled nursing facilities. I have worked several years in a SNF so Ill summarize a typical day in this setting.I get to work and print my schedule. I might have  patients for  minutes a piece. In a nursing home setting they are there all the time so its not crucial what order you see them in unless one of them has a doctors appointment or something.I might also have a request for an evaluation or two or  or . This is where you assess a patient to see if therapy should be recommended and if so you write their therapy plan and goals.However the bulk of the day is mostly therapy sessions which are repeated every day. My employer wanted us to spend about  of our time clocked in doing therapy. This means you have very little time for dillydallying in between patients. Its very different from when youre in school. When I was in training spent almost as long preparing for therapy as I did providing it. In the real world you have to do everything on the fly. Its not as scary as it sounds though because with experience you know just what to do for each type of patient without too much deliberation.What are the patients like? In a SNF you might be seeing a patient for results of stroke brain injury Parkinsons dementia and various other things but mostly dementia. When I first graduated I was surprised by this because they taught us very few specific techniques for dementiarelated problems in school. And yet in my first job probably  of my caseload had it. I dont want to get too far off on this tangent but the main implication of this is that much of your therapy is compensatory.Anyway now I do accent reduction and Im pretty sure Ive found my niche. Ive rambled on long enough but feel free to PM me with any questions!,slp,cflm9wc,2,t5_2sjju

616781,0,t3_217ge3,I am just a student but I saw one of my supervisor do something I thought was good for narrative cohesion. It was with a child but you can do this with a young adult as well. Im assuming by narrative cohesion you mean they have trouble staying on topicsaying things in order at the conversational level. Basically you place a coloured cards down from left to right on the table everytime they say things in order. If they skip around place some extra space between the cards and see if they can selfcorrect to fill in the blank or ask a clarifying question. At the end summarize everything they said and encourage them to summarize what they said as well more cohesively in order by pointing or looking at the cards to keep their mind on track. Ex What my supervisor did was ask the child how his trip went that he just got back from. He started talking about the airport delays and put a coloured card down then he started talking about something else and she didnt put a card down and refocused him. Then he talked about the lions he saw and she asked if that was right after they landed or a few days into the trip. He said a few days in so she left a big space put a card down and saw if he could go back and fill in the blanks to get more squares. I hope this is clear and somewhat helpful.

2721263,0,t1_cnbm0pv,Some general feedbackThe format is good. There is no magic format for resumes as long as its organized and easy to read allowing me to skim and quickly see what I want.Unnecessary itemsThe objectivesummary is fine but not necessary. It isnt going to lose you points but it isnt going to add anything. Removing it will not lose you anything and it will gain you space that you can use for more detailed relevant content.References do NOT need to be on resumes these days. Definitely not contact info and not even References available upon request. Its assumed that you will provide references. Save that space!AddMore Plz!I like the detail and information in your medical setting. Gives me an idea of the types of specific experiences you have very helpful for figuring out how much I might need to train you.I would condense the information under your university clinic which is fairly vague and generic and maybe highlight one or two interesting cases e.g. Experience coordinating care and cotreating complex diagnoses such as X.Sounds like you have LOTS of prior work experience I want to know more about that! Like I said student placement experiences are all the same. Looking at your past positions Id guess that you have a lot of organization communication and leadership experiences that most new grads dont have. You dont need to flesh out all your jobs but maybe  bullet points from all your nonclinical experience that highlight real accomplishments showing your abilities.QuestionI would just make a bullet point something like Experience with pediatric and adult trach care including suctioning etc. Overall dont worry about fancyperfect wording. When I read resumes I dont read in full sentences. Individual words jump out like trach or xray. ,slp,cnde9gp,3,t5_2sjju

3151814,0,t3_2w8z7a,Hey there!  I was a special ed aide for  years so not technically a teacher never got my license but I worked in the field and did many of the same things that my supervising teacher did helped write lesson plans and IEP objectives taught lessons etc..  I worked with pretty severe children and basically burned out after about  years so that was my motivation for going back to school.  The speech stuff we would do with the kids was by far the most interesting to me and that was what lead me to choose this path.  In my mind having worked in the field was absolutely an advantage when I started taking prereq classes.  Having already experienced a ton of the topics in the real world allowed me to bring a different viewpoint to discussions and assignments that at least I think my professors appreciated.  For instance Im taking an AAC class right now and some of the concepts can be a little abstract so having worked with a lot of kids who use AAC devices has been enormously helpful in wrapping my mind around the material.My only regret was not starting down this path sooner.  So I would  say if you really are interested in speech why not jump in right now?  But if money is an issue totally understand that! then I dont see any disadvantage to working in education for a few years.  Youll gain valuable experience that can a help you in grad school and your eventual career and b give you a competitive edge for getting into grad school lord knows you can use every edge you can get!. Theres going to be so many people applying right out of undergrad that some work experience can help get you noticed.Overall if you are interested in speech but want to work for a few years I would definitely recommend this route.  If you have any more questions or want some advice about how to get started just let me know! and good luck!Edit I did want to add one thing that I found to be challenging about going back.  Letters of recommendation.  Since I was pretty far removed from undergrad when I applied to grad schools last month fingers crossed! getting a bunch of letters of rec was tough.  The two professors that wrote me letters from my original undergrad for my first job have both passed away so they werent options.  Taking classes at night while working had a few challenges for the letters.  First almost every single prof. was adjunct i.e. not full time faculty with their PhD and while this shouldnt matter a number of prof. have told me that admission committees can sometimes frown on not having at least one letter from a full time faculty member.  Second taking night classes takes a long time and at least in my experience I never had a professor more than once until this past semester.  So it can be tough to get a great letter from a prof. who only had you for one class . years ago.  So I would say see if you can talk to some of your professors now about getting some letter lined up.  Explain your situation and ask if they would be ok writing you a letter a couple years from now.  It could save you the hassle of trying to track down old professors a few years from now.,slp,cooolm2,1,t5_2sjju

Everyone there is just so so nice and helpful. Its a very friendly studious environment!

The company has a lot of layers of corporate bullshit and treats their therapists with no respect. I worked with them for  years and never hears any review of my work no feedback no yearly review. They tried to stiff me on a raise they owed me. I had to actually threaten them with a labor lawsuit before they paid me my backpay.

If its strictly ortho probe to see if they have a hx of neuro problems which caused their most current problem. Check for their current diet and skim the chart for SLPrelated buzzwords.Mine would always start with Hi my names is . Im the speech therapist and I work on helping people here. I see everyone when they first get to this facility or if they leave and come back from the hospital. Can I get you anything before I ask you a few questions?I start out super vague to build a rapport and let them know I can help them with anything they need or help direct them to people they may want to speak to dietary nurse etc. Then Sometimes people have difficulty at meals I see youre on  diet. Have you had any difficulty eating this food? Do you have dentures? When you drink liquids do you often cough or get choked?If there are no obvious changes in diet and they say no to these questions I give the oz swallow test to see if a dysphagia eval is needed. I help support OT and PT with their goals of helping you walk again or use the toilet or stand up etc. These therapists will give you the tools to build strength but I want to make sure you are able to remember all the information they give you. I will ask you a few questions to look at your memory and how you think about information.At this point I usually test orientation short and long term memory. I throw in a few problem solving questions simple and then problem solving complex if needed.During this whole interaction you should be looking to see if you suspect neglect attention deficits impulsivity listening to their voicespeechlanguage and anything else which jumps out at you during this interaction. Particularly if this is a patient who will be picked up for OTPT if you pass on the patient you are saying they have no skilled needs for eatingswallowing voice speech cognition language and will be successful in OTPT without your support.I had great success with collaborating with OTPT to increase the success of patients. It is easy for all the disciplines to live in their own bubble but it is the combination of all treatments working together to ensure success. Nothing is worse than having a OTPT say they would be able to walk with a single point cane if they would be demonstrate greater safety awareness of their environment.

4442486,0,t3_3bxv02,What an amazing opportunity for you! It sounds like you are putting a lot of thought into your career choice and approaching it from a practical perspective.I was in your place a few years ago trying to decide if I wanted to pursue the field of psychology or transition over to speech. In the end I chose to become an SLP partly because it seemed to be a better fit for me personally but largely because it was a good career move.Pros of being in this field Nationwide need for SLPs and the number of jobs is projected to increase in coming years. Thats pretty good job security. HUGE variety in the field. There is the big split between SLPs in schools and SLPs in the medical field but there are sub areas of specialty including voice therapy stuttering TBI dysphagia autism AAC early intervention pediatric feedingswallowing articulation language and literacy etc. This also helps with burn out. If you get sick of working in one population you can do something completely different but remain in your field. Decent pay especially compared to social work. This last one is subjective but I personally like working in a field where I can know I am helping someone because I am taking data and measuring their progress. I find it very satisfying when I see my students reach their goals. If you are interested in psychologysocial work there are elements of both that cross over into speech pathology. I have my bachelors in psych and I find it extremely helpful for the work that I do.ConsChallenges Paperwork. Its inevitable. Large caseloadstoo much work. Too many SLPs I know work longer hours than they should or take work home with them. Productivity demands pressure to bring in revenue Generalization and carryover of treatment outside of direct therapy sessions.Its harder to come up with cons because they vary so widely depending on the setting you work in and I have fairly limited experience only working in one setting for the last  years since I entered the field. I could tell you about the cons in my job but I doubt they would apply most other places!The thing I like the most about being an SLP is trying to figure out the unique puzzle that each new client brings. Pathologists dont just treat we assess and diagnose communication disorders. Its sort of like being a detective. I also like being selfdirected. I am not my own boss I have a few people above me but I have the freedom to use my clinical judgment and make decisions in a way Ive never experienced in any other job.

I cried my whole way home  minutes. He passed away about a week after but I had almost already done my grieving. This was my introduction to how IMPORTANT!!!! advanced directives are. Shortly after another pt passed away and I wasnt nearly as affected.  We adjust quickly. My clinical supervisor helped me process the loss let me just observe treatments for the rest of the day rather than do them etc. I couldnt really talk for about an hour for fear of crying etc but I didnt have that big grief like I did for the first patient who just made the decision to go CCO. I think the big grief was almost like a loss of innocence on my part. I hadnt been around a lot of death  only one family member in my whole life at that point had passed away.Now Im in a SNF and it really depends on the case. The ones that are unexpected are harder to cope with. The facility holds a memorial once every  or  months and I always go look at the pictures remember them maybe talk to other residents I know they were friends with.My most common feeling is relief on behalf of the person who passed.I make a sincere effort to foster genuine human connection with my patients. I have a patient right now who decided to go CCO and I teared up during the family meeting but now my pt is so incredibly relieved she made that decision.

5193530,0,t3_3lw0sb,I recently started my CFY so heres what its been like for me as a brand new SLP. I work in a preschool. . I take work home  weeknightsweek and most weekends. I prefer to write my evaluation reports at home.  Its just easier for me to concentrate outside of the hustle and bustle of my setting preschool. I also plan for some of my kids the night before. Planning will hopefully get easier for me as I gain more experience and get to know my caseload by heart but for now its a bit like grad school clinicals but really not as bad. I just dont have that SLP bag of tricks built up yet thatll allow me to pull up something the day of and use it in therapy.  . I feel like I could get a job in most midsized cities Im not interested in living in a large city.. My setting follows the schoolIEP year so most kids will be on my caseload SeptemberMay with the possibility of summer service. So depending on how long the kid is enrolled at the preschool Ill be seeing most of them for at least a school year.. na. So far its treating the kids with severe autism nonverbal with significant behaviors. I have  or  of these kids on my caseload right now but they are definitely the hardest to treat and the most draining. Im currently relying a lot on the ed techs teachers and other staff to find ways to work with them. If I worked with that kind of population all day I dont think I would last long as an SLP. Thankfully I have a wide variety of needs on my caseload which I think will help keep me from feeling burnt out. . On busy days when my daily therapy notes get built up and I have to write them all at the end of the day it gets pretty tedious. But other days I have time to write them throughout the day so it evens out. . My CFY supervisor is onsite which feels like a godsend right now. Her being onsite was actually one of the main reasons why I accepted this job. If I ever have a question about a client therapy evaluation whatever I can just pop in and ask her or we can throw around ideas about a tricky case. If you go the SLP route definitely try and get an onsite CFY supervisor if you can. ,slp,cvc0ipf,1,t5_2sjju
5214237,0,t3_3lw0sb,.  I never take work home  like paperwork.  But I probably read work related texts  hours per week on my own time. I dont enjoy my job unless I feel confident and knowledgeable.  I also go through spurts where Ill make therapy materials for clients on my own time.  I usually enjoy this process because its an opportunity for me to reflect on the therapy process and come up with interesting ways to help my adult clients.. I could go anywhere and get the job I wanted but it took me about  years to build up my skillsresume so I felt that confident.. My relationship with clients usually lasts between a month and  years.. NA. Not feeling like I help my clients as much as Id like.  This feeling has subsided a bit over time as Ive expanded my conception of what help is.... Watching people eat lunch  when I worked acute I did this every day.  In outpatient settings its getting my medicare paperwork in line.. My CFY supervisor and other experienced SLPs in my clinic.

I really try to make the task about something they are interested in like a trip with several destinations household renovation or planning a fake college schedule. I think support from family friends and significant others is one of the most important prognosis factors along with the pts awareness of deficits. Quite frankly if the pt isnt aware of a change sp TBI you will get no where. Compensatory strategies are essential for our clients with mild deficits especially if they are expected to be independent.

8190110,0,t3_4rg3sn,that is a really tough way to start as a new SLP!  i did the summer program once at my district after my nd year with the district th year as an SLP and it was really challenging.  the kids are usually in a different classroom with a different teacher which takes them a while to get used to so their behaviors were more erratic overall.  even kids i had worked with quite easily during the school year gave me problems during the summer program.here is what i would do if i were you  ask the teachers if you can work in the classroom.  this is what i did and it worked well.  there were aides and teachers available if i had needed them. spend time pairing yourself with fun positive experiences for the kids.  dont expect them to work right away they have to buy into you as a person before theyll work for you.  bring toys games bubbles anything they like. start with easy tasks where theyll experience success.  praise them each time.  after they are successful work in some more challenging tasks and praise them each time whether theyre successful or not.  you can definitely correct them but something like im so happy you tried that will help if they were not able to do something.  observe them carefully during more challenging tasks  are they looking away?  are they fidgeting?  do they seem upset?  look for signs of stress and you can gauge how much they can handle.  if they are stressed reduce demands and let them experience success easily again. definitely set up the physical space to your advantage.  have something like a table between you and the kids.  you can position the table so theyll have to walk around it to get to you giving you time to react should they attempt to hurt you.  if they have fidget toys they like let them have them during the session.  if the kids are lashing out because of sensory issues or boredom having fidget toys may help with that.  remember that kids with autism may look like theyre not paying attention if they are fidgeting etc but they may actually be learning at that time.  having something to occupy one of their senses may actually help them focus on another sense. remember that what you do during a  week summer session isnt going to make or break their communication progress for the year.  the goal is maintenance  so if you can just keep them in the habit of coming to speech and working on their iep goals youve done your job.  dont stress out about it too much it is a really tough assignment for a new slp.good luck!,slp,d51bcxc,3,t5_2sjju

9171759,0,t3_55reei,I can just comment on my own personal experience as a CF I am a CF right now.  The district I completed my internship at used SEIS but the district I work in now uses another program. They didnt expect me to learn it right off the bat but I was also expected to learn fairly quickly as it is a pretty simple system. They did provide one half day of training and another optional day of training if I wanted it. Is there anyone in that CFs school that can help train himher? It doesnt have to be an SLP even an RSP or SDC teacher who is used to filling out IEPs and what not. At my internship there was a temporary SDC teacher who always came to the SLP to ask for help because nobody trained her on SEIS when she took the position.  A caseload of  sounds dreamy compared to my  I have right now... and thats not including the  open assessments I have that all look like they are going to qualify. A growing caseload is typical and  isnt that bad.  I cant comment on the lunch break. Did they say heshe cant take a lunch at all? Or that heshe takes a lunch whenever they want? I have work hours pm and I can take a  minute lunch or a  hour lunch if I wanted to... they didnt necessarily designate a lunch break. However Im not a contract SLP so take what I said with a grain of salt.  At one of my school sites I just held sessions in a conference room where another student was being held for detention. I still dont have printer access at one of my school sites and Ive been working for  months now. At my other site I have a decent sized room and a printer. I think it just varies where you are placed and what the school can offer you at that time. Does it suck? Absolutely  but I guess its just something SLPs have to deal with sometimes. I have three school sites as a CF. Sometimes I drive to all  school sites in one day therapy IEPs SST meetings picking up materials etc... I actually find it rare when I hear an SLP only has one school district. If they do then their caseload is usually large enough to justify it.  One of the school sites I took over was previously held by an SLP who just retired. That being said I had a TON of missing files upheld initial IEP meetings day meetings that probably were never held so and so forth. Its extremely frustrating to clean up the mess but as my CFsupervisor told me... Just know this isnt your fault She also told me not to worry about finishing up all the meetings on time. The meetings are already delinquent so there is no need to stress about holding them ASAP.  The supervisor expects them to work weekendsevenings? Was this more of a suggestion or was it written into their contract somehow? Ive been told by a couple SLPs that sometimes I will need to take work home but that its completely up to me. If it was more of a suggestion versus a YOU HAVE TO WORK WEEKENDSEVENINGS then I would definitely recommend the CF to have a chat with her supervisor about what the expectations are. Is there time for the CF to complete paperwork after the school day is over? Before the school day starts? I am still learning how to manage paperwork. Its definitely a challenge! Ugh. No mentorship during a CF. That was the first and absolute biggest priority I had when choosing where I was going to work. Did I want good money sure I did. I have a ton of loans to pay off. However I was very clear when I was interviewing what my expectations were for a CF supervisor and Im so very luck that I have one that is extremely supportive. She responds to my questions on the same day. We have monthly lunch meetings. She comes to a few of my IEP meetings and will watch some of my therapy sessions. Can the CF request another supervisor who can dedicate more time? Maybe they can problem solve as to how they can communicate better? Having a crappy CF supervisor isnt unheard of though... it could just be the luck of the draw. I dont know if its just my district but it seems like Im just as busy as other SLPs not CFs. I felt really lucky that I got a job as a CF and that someone was willing to supervise me. Maybe Im more of a unicorn situation cause I actually have a great CFsupervisor. I still felt EXTREMELY unprepared. I think this is a problem with a lack of preparation in certain areas that I did not get trained on during grad school. I dont think it was my school districts fault for things I didnt know how to do. With your question on why SLPs arent being treated in school as proper medical professionals? I have no idea. Just the other day my middle school SDC teacher yelled YOU DONT TEACH PHONICS?! I asked if she meant articulation and she replied Yeah whatever you want to call it.. its the same thing. Sigh. It could just be a lack of education on what SLPs actually do? Idk.. I do hope there is more respect for our field as it continues to grow in the future. I couldnt answer all of your questions but I hope there was something helpful in what I said. ,slp,d8el729,1,t5_2sjju

9288211,0,t3_56v5d7,Its neat to see them try to make CP more mainstream and it may have some effect on public perception but the writing is mostly derivative and predictable. Minnie Driver is actually a fantastic actor but shes coming off as overly intense and irritating in the show. Also as someone mentioned I cant believe the kid doesnt have a speechgenerator of some kind  the friendly janitor who becomes his aid seems to be there more for plot purposes than realism. ,slp,d8tcir0,1,t5_2sjju
9326364,0,t3_586t75,I have  students but that correlates to  thirty minute sessions each week. Not sure how that compares to some of the other numbers being given though. Those of you with very high caseloads how does that translate to sessionsminutes? I have students who receive between  and  minutes per week so its hard for me to conceptualize. Do you see each student once per week? Do you never see individual students? ,slp,d8y6ojw,2,t5_2sjju
9361602,0,t1_d9216up,I do work around there very close to the coast. Cost of living here is astronomical but the salaries for SLPs dont really catch up. I have found that most school districts in OC will also put you on the teachers scale. Havent found very many separate SLP pay scales. It may be because this area is fairly saturated as well. Take for instance the Irvine district. Probably one of the priciest areas to live in but starting pay for an SLP is . Houses there average . Not easy to make a comfortable living in the more populated areas here. ,slp,d92nflw,4,t5_2sjju

9528302,0,t1_d9n2obg,gt I can guarantee you they dont know what to do with the clients either and thats why youre not getting an answer.You know when it comes to behavior my supervisor falls back on things like yelling and negative reinforcement a lot.  When my client has a meltdown she comes in and yells at him and then she tells me she had to do that because I had messed up the situation so badly she had no choice.  Even with the clients we evaluate she often threatens them and speaks very sternly to them.  Then she always has an excuse like His mom is a friend of a friend or I talked to his parents and they said this is the only thing that works.  If we did those things wed be reamedno excuses.,slp,d9nkc19,3,t5_2sjju

9631108,0,t3_5cxqz1,Im just a student but I really dont think theres anything you can do just yet. Besides the usual of reading stories with him naming objects for him and play babbling with him. There could be a couple reasons for delayed milestones like these and the therapist will probably do a wonderful job at figuring out whats going on and explaining the best course of action to you. Good luck with everything!,slp,da08d02,-11,t5_2sjju

9819297,0,t3_5fsc6e,Dont feel obligated to stay if youre unhappy. Just be deliberate and have a really good plan for how youre going to transition. If you have a contract check it. Make sure you know exactly what you need to do in terms of the CF paperwork. Consider the fact that youll want this facility to be a good reference for your next job so leave on a positive note. Also consider that a very short tenure at your first position may look a little suspect on your resume.In terms of the setting I understand what youre saying. I feel fortunate to have gotten acute hospital experience in grad school because I had absolutely no inkling of how much I would dislike it until I tried it. Even under close supervision I was terrified and super stressed out for three months. I didnt like the lifeanddeath aspect of the work and I hated working under the doctors. I found my happy place in a specialized high school for students with intellectual disabilities ages . I never thought I was the kind of person who would work in the school setting. Working with older students was very different than standard pediatric work. Primarily language and prags with just a little bit of speech and other topics thrown in for good measure fluencyintelligibilityAACvoicehearingEF. Definitely safer feeling and so much glorious language.,slp,danh1b6,3,t5_2sjju

9880984,0,t3_5ghg68,Certified Nurses Aide. Seriously the best if you want to work with the elderly. A lot of SLPs have conflicts with CNAs because they dont understand how to communicate with CNAs or how to fit things into their already crazy schedule. Being a CNA gives you a great way to better understand that. Also teaches a lot about how to work with the elderly problem solve deal with families and deal with nursing home politics.  would make that decision again. Exhausting hard work but one of the most rewarding Ive ever had. Some days I miss it. ,slp,davikmo,1,t5_2sjju

10131778,0,t3_5kz3ap, your username.....wtf!???? is your mil still around maybe having your husband say something to his mother or father and have them gently talk to her might help.Youre right she needs to come to terms with him not meeting his developmental milestones. Its a tough pill to swallow especially when it seems shes grasping at straws texting you his new  words which are only approximations. A it cant hurt conversation telling her  hey if they are wrong then its just that then you move on,slp,dbs6ci0,5,t5_2sjju
10345552,0,t1_dcgov9p,I dont think I could live off what I make in the US but the cost of living in Spain is really low so I live pretty well.

10676149,0,t1_ddh1u0d,I work in the public schools as well. Unfortunately I dont currently have any resources regarding echolalia. I do have a discussion with the parents bringing awareness to the level of verbal prompting we tend to give without realizing it during tasks. I also talk about or show the parents the kinds of activities we do in therapy so that they can do them at home. I also offer when I have time to make icons for families who are interested.,slp,ddh5x7v,1,t5_2sjju

11806241,0,t3_68gjsh,Most private practices treat both children and adults though usually most of their clients are children. Not a bad place to start. If theyre worth their salt theyll have someone answering the phone who is knowledgeable enough to know if you can pay privately or if your insurance might even help out. If they dont treat adults they may know who in your area does.Another good idea is to check if theres a speech therapy graduate program in your city. Many of those programs take clients at reduced rates and have excellent clinical supervision.,slp,dgya0vn,11,t5_2sjju
