619058,0,t1_cgaj48z,Yeah I figured that was the case. Just waiting it out I guess. Ive been kinda frustrated because my chart looks like I have pcos and low thyroid function but Im pretty sure its just the weight loss. ,KetoBabies,cgamyuu,2,t5_2znsm

2098628,0,t3_2bhm8m,Johns Hopkins developed the ketogenic diet originally to treat kids with epilepsy and since it has been apparent that it works with myriad other neurological problems as well.And there is evidence that the keto diet works in diminishing migraine in adults. I am not aware of any studies about it in limiting migraine in kids though but it seems like a viable alternative.,KetoBabies,cl6kyo5,2,t5_2znsm

With this pregnancy I stuck to low carbs and have done amazing! Im currently  weeks and weigh add much as I did when I started baby is a great size and my bp and glucose are completely normal. ,KetoBabies,cs19fmz,2,t5_2znsm
4645132,0,t3_3ekcew,I tried to do keto while breastfeeding and it tanked my supply. But that was just me it could be great for others. Just thought Id put that out there.  As long as they are having the appropriate number of wet and poopy diapers your supply is fine and gaining weight of course.,KetoBabies,ctg30u0,1,t5_2znsm
5000376,0,t1_cuoqauq,I think you are misunderstanding them. Absolutely the demands on  your pancreas will go up as pregnancy progresses. But that is not gestational diabetesit is plain old having diabetes and being pregnant. You cant get diabetes upon diabetes. Keep up the good work mama! Thats a great AC number mine was similar when we conceived!,KetoBabies,cuoqdzm,2,t5_2znsm

6538835,0,t3_44u4vm,Personally I preferred to just eat the galactogogues on their own instead of making cookies because I felt like it was more effective and less likely to sabotage my diet than having a bunch of cookies around. But I got the best results from Mothers Milk tea. And the best way to increase your supply is just by nursing frequently and drinking a ton of water I only did the supplemental things to try to increase my below average pump output. ,KetoBabies,czvo33k,1,t5_2znsm
6725963,0,t1_d0f0lxl,Its been so frustrating. Im taking measurements weekly and using a scale that calculates approximately my body fat vs water and so on. Im losing only  body fat or so per week or week and . So frustrating. And I just dont feel like all the hard work is showing yet. But I do feel great and I believe in the program. Im hoping to breastfeed for  months to a year or so and as long as my milk supply holds up Im hoping to stick to that. Ive heard some moms swear by breastfeeding as a way to lose weight but I feel like it might be stalling or slowing my progress. Good to know Im not alone. ,KetoBabies,d0f0ubb,2,t5_2znsm
7223951,0,t1_d1y3kn0,Hey thank you for the input. I felt like my head was finally in the right space yesterday to jump back into Keto so I took the plunge. Wasnt a full day of keto I had a relatively carby breakfast and I woke up with cramps already last night... I took a large dose of electrolytes before bed too... Ill just keep trying to tweak it maybe itll improve if I just keep at it for a few weeks... I do have a lot of fluid retention so thats probably not helping I peed several times during the night lol. I was drinking a lot of water the last time around approx . ltrs a day not sure what that is in gallons. Thankyou for the breakdown of what you take I think Ill follow that and see where I need to tweak it... How are you going with the weight loss? When I tried last year twice I found the weight just didnt budge and I didnt feel as good as I usually do on Keto. Searching for answers led me to Prolactin as the likely culprit... especially as my monthlies hadnt returned properly then. But they have now and I have to say a single day of Keto and my body already feels less inflamed and I can move easier. When Im breastfeeding I dont count cals I just loosely count carbs and from previous stints I have a good idea of what is a good limit for me to eat... plus my hunger drops a lot except the week before Shark week where I eat as much keto friendly foods as I want to.,KetoBabies,d1zb51v,1,t5_2znsm
7699361,0,t3_4kp2me,I have definitely lost weight faster due to breastfeeding. My TDEE is  calories instead of the predicted  by the keto calculator even though my daughter is  months and eating more solid food. You can retain water when youre sick so Id give it some time. Breastfeeding can be a hassle but Im really glad to still have this extra closeness and bonding time with my daughter but everyone should be able to decide whats right for them. ,KetoBabies,d3hd7v3,2,t5_2znsm
8957480,0,t3_4wp042,Yay!  Bfing too and as long as I get enough protein and eat regularly I feel like a super hero.  The energy is amazing.  However when i forget to eat or keep up on electrolytes I crash and burn.  Keep it up mama nice work!!!,KetoBabies,d7ojzn4,2,t5_2znsm

9402136,0,t3_59b8ax,Congrats on your BFP! I would focus on healthy diet and nourishing your body and baby throughout your pregnancy not the numbers on the scale so if you have been doing well on Keto keep at it. But if morning sickness hits just do what you need to do. ,KetoBabies,d97scl6,1,t5_2znsm
9803433,0,t1_dal4ahw,Oh good Im only at about  Vitamin A even with the shakes I was drinking  prenatals so I dont have to suddenly freak out. Ill still definitely ask my OB though. ,KetoBabies,dalhfrk,1,t5_2znsm

10737610,0,t3_5tl7m4,Erythritol sadly gives me gas so its entirely possible. Worth cutting it out for several days to see if baby gets better. Its supposed to metabolize pretty fast in your digestive system but Im not sure if that would be before or after it could get to your breastmilk. Dairy can also be a common cause of gas in babies so maybe try that next if it doesnt seem to be erythritol.Also infant gas drops are amazing. Get some if you havent tried them already. ,KetoBabies,ddni4vs,1,t5_2znsm
11467885,0,t1_dfvt89c,I think my electrolyte intake should be good. I will definitely increase water to a gallon or more. I already have to use the bathroom every  minutes at oz so cant get much worse! Thanks!,KetoBabies,dfvvmya,1,t5_2znsm
11502503,0,t1_dfzjlna, Haha! Yeah this is the heaviest Ive ever been non pregnant. I wouldnt really mind because Im doing other very useful stuff with my body but Im also eating a lot of dumb stuff. And my shape doesnt suit a bunch of clothes I like.,KetoBabies,dfzt4la,2,t5_2znsm
