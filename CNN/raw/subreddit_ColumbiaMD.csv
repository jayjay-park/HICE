788833,0,t3_236m00,You should get Waze. You will probably need directions to get around for the first bit but it also warns you of speedred light cameras. Its pointed out quite a few cameras I didnt notice before.Although around here traffic usually abruptly drops to  mph below the speed limit right around the camera... which is why no one gets the tickets. Although I am pretty sure tickets arent given until  or  mph.,ColumbiaMD,cgty07t,5,t5_2slie

7916828,0,t1_d45pbht,Glad to see the optimism and I agree.  The libraries are amazing here and I love running on the trail system.  As long as the county is able to keep those maintained and safe I will continue to be happy living here. Maybe its eastern Columbia thats going down hill more so than the entire town?  The mall area does seem to be growing by leaps and bounds. Anyway the complaints I have are just small gripes when compared to the surrounding towns you could live in.  Aside from anything in western Howard county of course.,ColumbiaMD,d45xcun,2,t5_2slie
