1823305,0,t3_2ffqzs,I was not into furryMUCK myself.I just discovered an interest in Reddit recently but I am usually solitary.Technology? No. Society? Well that goes into the larger question of whether society has improveddeclined in the last twenty years. Im not sure.Sex  ohmygodyes  I was  uh um  ah yseee ... I was kind of involved with some of the battles on Alt.Fan.Furry. There were several groups  this was ... ? years back or so ... Essentially there were people who simply and only liked the cleaner stuff. There were people who were mostly into the freer expression of sexuality which reflects greater society. It was kind of like two rows of pews at church. On the one side Disneyesque innocence. On the other side the Seventies were still very much alive. In the broadest possible terms. Then there were some malcontents who took it upon themselves to become the arbiters of what should be in the fandom. Look up Burned Fur. My perpsective was that furry fandom is big enough for everyone. A snark of the time was that by and large furry fans were Bi and Large. So yeah sex was quite the hot topic. Some furs just wouldnt  couldnt  deal with the spooge and such. The first furs were our distant ancestors a million years back who first put on antlers or named their tribe after their main food source. But you likely mean that in modern times. Relatively normal  well whats normal? You could probably say that we are people who really just like the idea of furry more than most. Then there were the inhabitants of alt.lifestyle.furry like myself who really felt that it was a deep expression of self. And then there were the people who simply liked the artwork. The fandom was always so creative!Things change. Best to roll with them. ,Graymuzzles,ck8wbzf,3,t5_32kiz
