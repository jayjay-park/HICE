43411,0,t1_cejcptx,Have you any suggestions as far as lighter options go? I actually dont plan on staying in Canada much longer. One of my biggest objectives is something good for traveling. Minimal weight quite packable. The Northface thunder packs into its own pocket and turns itself into a bit of a nice airline pillow.   Thank you for the links. Id never heard of norther outfitters. Seems like some nice no BS affordable clothing.   Ive always loved merino but never known much about it. Been meaning to order some darntough socks as well. Nice to hear some good reference.

48957,0,t3_1ulxt1,I spend a fair amount of time tramping around in Yosemite havent done the whole JMT but its on the list.  Here are some things that will make your hike more pleasurableSven Saw for cutting logs and making a fire.Ditch the bowltupperware and get a small frisbee.  You can use it as a plate cutting board and...a frisbee.It seems like you might have too many pieces of clothing.  MidAugust should be pretty warm at high elevations you can use your sleeping bag for warmth but you might be a heatchallenged person.I have a pair of carbon fiber black diamond hiking poles and I LOVE them.  Id be worried about your listed poles they dont seem very durable.Ditch one of the lights a headlamp should be sufficient.I like to bring carabiners and rope along on all my hikes.  More often than not these items come in handy.Is the packtowel nano a poop shovel?  If not youll need one you have to bury your poop per park policy.  I use a cheap plastic gardening trowel.  Also you might want to look into this but the last time I checked you had to pack your poop out of Mt. Whitney.  This is probably still the case so you need a plan for that.I dont think youll need the odor proof bag since you will be required to haul a bear can.  Speaking of which you might need two.  The ones you rent in the park are sufficient for  days of normal eating for one person.Have fun!,Ultralight,cek05g8,-1,t5_2s7p2

167286,0,t1_cewy26u,I recommend the HOODED R. You wouldnt think so but its become my most used layer when Im active. Its athletic fit keeps me very warm and the builtin balaclava will quickly add  degrees. If you factor in the hood its actually very close in warmth to the R based off trying it in the store I dont actually down the R.I wore it underneath a goretex active shell in  degree temps skiing last night and was perfect. I was a little cold on the lift but once I zipped it up fully that was no longer a problem. I have a Ghost Whisperer hooded and a Mont Bell Mirage both of which are very warm but I would never do anything active in them. Combined with the ul down sweater youd have a good combo for camp too.

363557,0,t3_1y92tx,Nothing wrong with brand loyalty to Osprey in my book. They make great packs.This page on their site might be helpful to you if you havent found it already. It includes instructions on how to measure and fit for a pack but also down near the middle is a chart that shows the torso size ranges for all of the various sizes of all of their packs.Your wifes torso size is going to be the first thing to be concerned about before you worry too much about pack volume. Ospreys Womens Small which is the smallest size that the Aura comes in runs from  to . If your wife falls safely in that range then you can probably safely choose from any of Ospreys womens line based on the features andor volume you want to go with.On the other hand if her torso size is down at the bottom of that range or below say anywhere in  you might want to consider something like the Ariel  instead which you could get in an Extra Small L capacity or possibly the Kyte  which comes in XSS L capacity.The trampoline backpanel on the Aura is really nice though if your wifes in the right size range for their Womens Small. Much nicer in hot weather than the AirScape backpanel on their other packs.But as everyone else has already said I wouldnt make any kind of final decisions before you know better what kind of volume youre going to need.,Ultralight,cfig5fd,2,t5_2s7p2

689264,0,t3_21zgh4,Maybe  is personal challenge. Most of it is comfort and fun. My initial motivation to drop pack weight was a crosscountry hike in the Sierras with a lb pack that simply wasnt fun to hike. In parts it was fine but going uphill just plain sucked and I realized that the trip would have been much more fun for me and my hiking buddies with lighter packs.I dont go for minimal weight possible I go for balance of weight and comfort. I analyze each piece of gear carefully before I bring it to determine if its added weight i.e. discomfort on the trail is worth the additional comfort in camp. I guess I always did this but now Im realizing how comfortable I can be in camp without bringing all sorts of extras. Now when I go out my pack is usually about  lbs and I get much less tired can handle much steeper terrain and can go considerably further without breaks. That extra energy makes for a more fun wilderness experience. If I see something off my route that looks fun to climb or check out Im more likely to spend the effort to get there rather than slogging on to my destination. I feel more like an adventurer than a pack mule.If I was going for personal challenge I would do more of a Survivorman type thing heading out with just a match and a multitool. Thats fun in its own way but its not what Im usually looking to do when I go backpacking and its a very different mentality from ultralight.,Ultralight,cgimd3o,1,t5_2s7p2

We live in new England though and are able to do bear hangs almost everywhere we go so cleaning out a pot and having a cleaner hang bag aloksak in a dry bag makes sense to us.

930535,0,t3_24pva3,Ive owned the Contrail for over  years now and let me just offer some advice...  if you want to do cooking or menial tasks while protected while optimally warm inside a sleeping bag then a sideentry design like the Notch or MLD Solomid is the way to go.  Some kind of design with either side opening in case of wind change...  In fact once my Contrails lifespan is up I plan to go that route.The Contrail isnt bad but it has limitations in foulweather livability.  When it was first purchased I was thinking in terms of weight savings not livability or comfort.  The lack of situp space and the slacking wedgeroof design leaves much to be desired.  I often find bendingleaning forward into the vestibule to cook is stressful on my back after a long trek.  I also find that the single vestibule gets quite crowded  storing pack and gear an open place for cooking and room enough to enterexit...  Speaking of ingress and egress is a bit of a pain...  like crawling into a tunnel.  Not that I cant do it but it continues the feeling that the Contrail is more of a large bivvy and less a practical tent.,Ultralight,cha21bf,2,t5_2s7p2

Ive not looked at the weather outlook but Ill always bring a windshirt before a puffy  it adds F just by cutting wind.  Trekking poles are great depending on the direction of travel... climbing Whitney is a bitch at the end of a  mile trip.  They also add a form of shelter see below mosquito nettinggt Sleeping bag is probably overkill since I sleep hot anywayOooo ho ho ho.  Unless you are going for a speed record on the JMT or hiking at night and sleeping during the day you will want a sleeping bag.  Temps at elevation and any drafts will make you one cold fish.  If you really want to save weight dont bring the tent... just string some UL mosquito mesh between your trekking poles and sleep under that.Your list looks good and Ill only recommend replacing paracord with Spectra cord.

The problem with fleece pants is you dont want to take your hiking pants off when its that cold so youll want something you can put over your regular pants for camp or summits.  Insulated ski pants or down pants with zippers up to the calves are great or full zip so you dont have to take crampons or snowshoes off if you need them.For the top I like a short sleeve  weight wool over a long sleeve  weight wool or synthetic for  degrees uphill hiking since I can stay relatively sweat free.  Add the windshirt if its breezy and youre still working hard.  A  weight fleece under the windshirt for ridge walking or slower pace and a heavy down jacket something in the  to  ounce range for hanging out at the summit or camp.  You might be ok with the rain jacket over the light down jacket over the windshirt and fleece but sometimes you inadvertantly sweat up the fleece and baselayers so make sure you have an extra.For the head I like a very light balaclava to keep my cheeks warm.  A neck gaiter is an excellent addition if I need more head or face warmth and works great under a wind shirt hood.  Other than that a thick fleece hat is nice for camp under my down jacket hood.For hands have at least one set of spare glove liners since I find it easy to sweat those out.  I sometimes layer a pair of ski gloves over the liners for hiking even if Im in just the baselayers usually if its at all breezy.  I like a set of heavy mittens for camp and stops as well.  Some people like to use medical gloves as vapor barrier liners under their liner gloves which works well but I havent tried it.I sleep on the ground like a dog so I cant comment on your hammock.  If youre concerned about warmth you can add a waterproof nonbreathable sleeping bag liner as a vapor barrier to keep your insulation from gathering condensation from your body sweat.  Also keep a set of dry sleeping clothes. ,Ultralight,cngbc8z,1,t5_2s7p2

I agree with NaturalLaw that just getting a hard shell is the better option.With regards to layering with down Ive never been in temperatures cold enough that I wanted the down jacket on while hiking.

I think that youre probably overthinking whats below you and maybe ending up a little light on top. Still I dont think youll be in any kind of danger.Are you really planning on putting the hot water bottle into the UQP below your hammock? Seems like you wouldnt really end up getting much benefit from it there particularly given all the reflective insulation youre planning on using between it and you.Is your Air Core insulated or just a plain one? If its just a plain Air Core you might find that its not doing a whole lot for you other than complicating your stack. Still Id keep it with you in case you decide to bail and go to ground.In any case the Reflectix will probably do you more good on top of your pad than below it.Condensation is going to be your biggest problem with all of that plastic though.

3907956,0,t1_cr1oazq,I dont think people would actually expect you to give up your fishing equipment if your reason for camping is to go fishing but sometimes people dont clarify those facts.  I am not trying to blame posters only illustrate that in some cases there is a lack of communication and both the OP and the commenters take things very personally.  Example I love stargazing and have several telescopes.  If I came on rultralight and one piece of equipment was a lb reflector telescope I think it would be ok for someone to suggest that I bring binoculars instead.  That does not mean that I have to listen to them or that they have to force me to leave the telescope behind.  But it is interesting to make me consider my gear choices.  Perhaps next time I am in the market for a telescope I will look at what I can take backpacking more easily.  Maybe you wont leave your fishing poles behind but you will ask yourself how many flies you really need or whether you can bring a smaller pole or something along those lines.    It is this reason that a lot of people leave some of their specialized gear out of their pack lists.  I know this doesnt really solve the problem but it allows people to focus on what is known by everyone rather than having someone try to offer criticism on a field they are only somewhat aware of.  Trust me I wont ever be suggesting fishing poles to you.  On the whole suggesting things that people arent comfortable with I am sort of with you but I think most of the suggestions come from a wish to provide alternatives rather than call someone out.  Since gear selections are pretty personal everything thinks they are doing what is best rather than understanding that it is simply what is best for them.         ,Ultralight,cr1qpmq,3,t5_2s7p2

That is a good amount of Ibuprofen and Chafe cure. The first is something you can just buy along the way. And the second is a cure for something that should be prevented you probably only need enough to make it to town this is from somebody who doesnt chafe much though.You can also delay when you carry the DEET. Contacts.... personal choice but that is  of a lb right there. Could just wear glasses.For electronics... you could get a single port usb charger and a single micro usb cable. Then pick up a micro to lightning adapter. Spent town time topping off the battery pack or vice versa. And use a ft micro cable could probably save maybe oz doing that?

5316502,0,t3_3npg3g,For just boiling water and FBC then the system is great. Later you could upgrade to a conical stand like the Caldera Cone for better fuel efficiency and wind protection.For a while I used a ml cup with a heavy duty aluminum foil from a used turkey pan wind screen and a StarLyte Stove It works and is very light.This year I switched to the ml pot experimented with a DIY Cone and kept the stove. I designed the cone so I could use my esbit burner or the StarLyte. The Ti foil for my DIY Cone was from Titanium Goat The hard part in making the cone is the attachment that holds it together. Trail designs has the best solution for that problem.All that so I could boil enough water for both a meal and a hot drink.If you want the absolute best fuel efficiency with esbitalcohol use a cone with a wider pot. Greater surface area heats water faster. See the Open Country  cup pot or the Toaks ml The hard anodized aluminum is reportedly better if you want to do some cooking in the pot as it distributes heat a wee bit better. But getting a controlled simmer flame from esbit or alcohol is another problem entirely. ,Ultralight,cvr8uso,2,t5_2s7p2

Im guessing you have  pounds of food and water leaving you a  bound base weight.  Thats too heavy for a thruhike.  Youre guessing on some of these weights.  Cant help you unless you are completely accurate and weigh everything in grams.  If you arent looking at accurate grams on everything you cant make informed decisions on what to keep  what to swap out.  If you dont already have a kitchen scale to measure in accurate grams... stop everything get one start weighing everything.  You need to break everything into its components and weigh them all separately.  You dont need a tent weight you need a fly body groundcloth steak each sack pole weights.  For example I can show you how to pitch that tent with just the poles some steaks and the fly and a DIY ground cloth which would save you a pound.

6380535,0,t3_42ymul,I have a Vargo Hexagon Emberlit FireAnt Ti and EmberlitUL original.Weighing between oz they are handy windscreens for my cat can stove as well as for citronella candles to keep bugs away. Since I need a windscreen anyway the incremental weight is just oz. Additional uses justify that for me. I like the option to start a small fire under my tent vestibule for warmth waiting out a rainstorm and the FireAnt has the added benefit of working well with Esbitstyle solid fuel tablets. I prefer to underprovision my liquid fuel and the Esbits are my backupemergency option.However I get the most utility out of using wood stoves to heat water for luxury foods such as coffee or hot cocoa. That way I dont have to plan for or carry extra fuel and I can have as many hot drinks as I want provided Im willing to tend the fire for a bit which is sometimes just plain fun. Open fires would also do the trick but they require a lot more fuel for just a drink plus you have to figure out how to position your cupkettle stably.Comparing them the Vargo is heaviest and hardest to tend the fire but its by far the easiest to assemble but tends to selfdisassemble at inopportune times. Its good for stop and go trips with lots of dry wood. Both Emberlits are kind of annoying to assemble but more stable and usable once set up. These are my choice when staying in one spot for more than one meal.,Ultralight,czewcxy,1,t5_2s7p2

6386385,0,t1_czcsrn6,Nice kit. Here are my thoughts.Backpack I see its not marked with a green star anymore. I was going to suggest looking at the one made with XPac by Cascade Designs Not as light but it is waterproof which is my favorite feature of cuben.Stakes The regular titanium ones are fine. I think the Dutchware design is superior to the Zpacks because the hook is better shaped I use both. But CF sounds cool and Id like to try them.Tarp If youve got the dough go for it. Otherwise silnylon is great Oware has a great reputation. If youve got or know someone with sewing skills you could consider silpoly. It weights a little less than silnylon but doesnt absorb as much water and stretches a lot less. So its got some of the great qualities of cuben but weighs more.Rain jacket I like ponchos umbrellas and getting wet in the rain if its not cold. But Im not normal.Camera bag I like it and have been looking for something to put on my belt. Thanks.External battery My phone is off and the battery helps my wife feel a little more secure. So I carry a mha. Thats enough to charge my phone. But it will run my Garmin eTrex  GPS via USB if needed.Just my c. As usual YMWV and HYOH. edit formatting,Ultralight,czfkctq,1,t5_2s7p2

I guess I may have to do some more ordering. The soft water bottle idea I really like and thats a cheap buy great suggestion and i own one!. I wonder if its better to carry a fleece Vs a puffy down jacket in the summer or do you mean not at all? I know its always safety first but this is Ultra light after all and if Grandma Gatewood could hike the AT with a shower curtain I think Ill be okay knowing I have more than i need to survive. Some have suggested my down jacket is too heavy but I own it already and after seeing the ghost whisperer IRL I know the weight and comfort savings are negligible at most. Crocs im totally fine leaving at home no big deal. I think think i will buy a micro weight beanie soon I just want something i can pull over my eyes while sleeping. Maybe all i need is my buff though. Phone charger is the first thing Id leave home Im embarrassed to even have included it. I hiked the  mile wilderness without a phone at all last summer and had no regrets. I dont know if ill ever buy a bottom quilt though. They cost a lot and Im a cheapo.

When I use my pot to cook I always scrub the leftover food off using a bit of water and then drink it. I think getting in the mindset that this isnt dirty water is key though. It is just water with a little food in it. Fresh food that you literally just finished eating EDIT if youve cooked something with a lot of oil in it often the pot will be all oily even after fingerscrubbing it.

While the canister stoves are maybe less likely to break because they have less moving parts they are also almost impossible to fix on the trail and potentially period.  The Whisperlite has more moving parts but you can completely field strip the thing and will almost certainly be able to repair it if need be.  The Whisperlite deserves to be in the gear hall of fame but I still would recommend almost anything else above it right now just because the weight is insane and the new stoves can be super cheap super light and super reliable.

7757969,0,t1_d3nxvqi,Im  and sleep fine in my Lunar Solo. I usually keep my backpack under the vestibule and a few things next to me in the extra space within the tent but one could bring the backpack in as well no problem. The tent wall slopes down at the head end of course as all tents of similar design will but you can use the tieout to raise the tent wall if you feel closedin tie it off to a branch or tie a line to your second trekking pole and then to the ground as I sometimes do.One of my favorite things about the Lunar Solo is that I can sit up comfortably in the middle without hunching. That was an important feature for me. And I adore having the entire side open both for view and for air circulation. The vestibule is easy to adjust quickly.The main thing to know going in is that the tarptent has to be set up properly to handle wet conditions well the tub floor should be slightly raised and the vents at the floor slightly exposed by  setting the peak at the right height  which you can mark on your trekking pole for future reference. Also in damp conditions youll have more contact with condensation than you would with a doublewall tent. The big mesh side wall mitigates that by providing great ventilation and for me the disadvantages are worth it because of the light weight sitting room and view.The Lunar Solo requires a trekking pole or accessory pole a scrounged limb will do if you keep the ends from damaging the tent fabric. I use trekking poles when I hike so it means I dont have to carry redundant tent poles.,Ultralight,d3o0sov,5,t5_2s7p2

8828205,0,t1_d75rv9w,I would say you dont need camp shoes. I think if your footwear is so uncomfortable that you need to use campshoes then you just need new footwear. Trail runners are really popular. But sandal users represent a dedicated contingent as well.Id take a look at those pants. With the belt they are almost a pound.  A cheap pair of nylon running pants from a thrift store will be half the weight or less and they dont need a belt.. ounces of soap is so much soap. I carry . ounces and its really only for an emergency like if my digestion is really bad and I need to be clean.You could probably cut down your med kit a bit. Do you really need  pills? That seems like a lot of pills. Ive never seen people carry antifungal. Unless you have persistent fungus problems it seem unnecessary. A big part of going UL is packing for what you think probably will happen. Not all the worstcase what ifs. Example I dont bring a space blanket because I think I will probably keep my sleeping bag dry and Ill use that when I sleep. If I brought every whatif worst case scenario item...I could never carry a very light load. ,Ultralight,d790zu4,1,t5_2s7p2

8839750,0,t1_d7ae5m9,I couldnt believe it either! Lots of down is stuck in the seams or compressed by the sewnthru construction. I started by ripping all the seams letting the down fall into a pile at the bottom of the quilt. Then I opened up the corner nearest the pile and moved handfuls of down into trash bags. Once I collected most of it I rinsed the fabric in the shower and washed any remaining down away leaving a clean fabric shell behind. When I refilled the finished product same thing in reverse pretty much. To distribute the down evenly after every  minutes of filling I hung the quilt from my shower curtain rod and spread out the down. If you have a shop vac theres some cleaner ways to do all this. But I did all this in my bathtub with the curtain closed and hardly had any down escape into the rest of the house.,Ultralight,d7aev6d,3,t5_2s7p2

This would be for weeklong late summerearly fall trips in the Adirondacks cans are encouraged everywhere and required in some places. So season hiking. Hopefully good weather but maybe some rain and some cold. After the bug season so some colder nights and the need for some clothing layers I can get cold really easily in anything below  degrees unless Im moving around a lot.My current base weight is about . lbs. Adding the can brings it up to  pounds.  I really want to get lighter. Now that Ive thought about it all day I should probably continue to use my ULA Circuit until the other components of my gear are all lighter before really think about packs.

9340977,0,t3_58dpbk,Ideally youll want different gear for the desert section and the mountains.  A  degree sleeping system for the mountains should be plenty while a  degree system for the desert should be enough deserts get colder than you think at night.Depending on your experience I would suggest you skip down products and go for synthetic as other have suggested as they remain effective while wet.  They weigh a little more but its a safety thing.  Generally the more experience you have the less you need to rely on gear.  Ultralight on the PCT puts you at optimal performance but at that level youre gambling that you wont encounter unexpected circumstances.  Due to the length of the PCT Murphys law approaches  probability. I would suggest white capilene leggings rather than hiking pants.  If you must wear hiking pants on a cold day or morning use your rain pants if you have them as they do double duty or wrap yourself in your sleeping system.  Usually if you keep your core warm your extremities will stay warm enough.  In the desert section youll want to keep exposed skin to a minimum to stay cool hence the white capilene suggestion.  Every time Ive thru hiked the trail temps have exceeded the  degree limit of my little thermometer.  Many pause during the hottest part of the day to rest and hydrate in the shade.  I would also suggest treating your gear with permethrin as there are ticks aplenty in the southern section the concentrate can be found online.Best way to stay warm at night is be mindful of cold air flows.  Cold air flows down valleys like water as its heavy and damp.  If you camp near water or where runoff would flow temps can be  degrees colder than if you camp up higher where the warm air rises.  Most dedicated campsites will be low near water in cold spots.  This is also where youll encounter the most wildlife bears are annoying but mice can be much worse.  The strategy usually employed is to eat dinner near water and put in some miles after dinner to stealth camp high and dry.  By high and dry I dont mean exposed I just mean up away from the cold air flows.,Ultralight,d901bkc,3,t5_2s7p2

10055438,0,t1_dbhwjcp,I suspect if youre skiing and you try the soft shell approach you wont be dissapoined its much easier to move than any skiing jacket. I experimented with a berghaus down jacket as my outer layer  one that had that hydro treated fill. It was fine for insulation and warmth and surprisingly durable  but I took a spill on a big double black bowl and there was just no friction between me and the snow due to the covering of the jacket.They have a kind of glossy finish  I went rocketing past my skiing buddies and they shouted see you in the chalet as it looked like I wasnt going to stop till the bottom of the mountain. The more rugged soft shells seem to have better friction coefficient with the snow and so its not like being a one man toboggan. The only other absolutely minor niggle I have with the arcteryx is that the loops for tightening the bottom of the jacket sort of hang down. Its never happened bit I could imagine them snagging on a chair lift with interesting results. To emphasise though hasnt happened in thousands of ski lifts yet but I think it could. If I was looking at different soft shells Id just check if theres any exposed cord loops and make sure it wont be an issue. Although it has a helmet compatible hood Ive never used it whilst skiing but have used it while wandering around the city and it works fine good visibility. One other thing to add. They are a little vague about how water proof they are. Id say light shower proof. I did the tour de mont blanc last year and a lady had one as her rain shell and it was wetting through. This was in what Id call biblical rain  really strong. My wife has a more traditional Acteryx hard shell and had no problems. When I bought the one I bought they said it was designed for Snow boarding and back country skiing and it has been great for that purpose.,Ultralight,dbi8xth,2,t5_2s7p2

It was my intro back into backpacking after kind of pursuing other interests since my AT thruhike in . My last trip of the BT hike was my first ultralight backpacking trip and kind of the beginning of my speed hiking test trips multiple days of  miles.The Bartram Trail is really an amazing experience. It feels like getting a glimpse of the Appalachian Trail that Grandma Gatewood may have known more than  years ago. I like that everythings primitive from signage to campsites to the treadway itself. TherAll that being said the trail became quite overgrown at lower elevations by spring and I got a serious poison ivy rash when I got home. Looking back I should have been dancing through the ivy a little more carefully should have used more sticks to move large vines and DEFINITELY should have just brought more biodegradable soap and washed up better at night. I had gone out in April and it felt like winter. Then in May it was like a spring green jungle and I found myself rationing the winter quantity amount of soap I brought way less than I do in warm months for body washing.

Have you any experience with the BRST? Do you like it? For all the consumables Im actually working on getting useful measurements of them. I know I have too much of things like sunscreen but I know for sure Im WAY too pale skinned to not have enough sunscreen Id be miserable. My current solution is that as I go on trips say carcamping and day hikes Ill measure how much of that sort of thing I actually use and then repackage accordingly for backpacking trips. Its been ongoing Im just not quite there yet with all of the personal items. Some of it has been done already like the eyederopper of soap and some of it will be really hard to reduce I literally used the  small containers of Purell over a  day trip so thats already calibrated correctly. Im wondering if I can save more by washing my hands more frequently instead of using sany but that will be an experiment in the field before its a reduction in pack weight.Ill most definitely google up your other recommendations and see what I think will work for me. ,Ultralight,dcmr7lc,1,t5_2s7p2

The straps wore out after  miles but the soles were still fine though I still bought new ones as getting the straps replaced was too much work while still on the trail.Pros fantastic in warm weather didnt need camp shoes easy to cross streams last for a long time.  Can carry fewer socks since wet socks arent an issue theyll dry out quickly if you even wear socks.Cons toe stubbing although you learn pretty quickly straps can be painful sometimes though your feet adapt your feet will be utterly filthy even if you wear socks thruhiking isnt clean in general but seriously your feet will look awful. I cant remember which model I own but the tread isnt wonderful.  Wet rocks can be an issue and if the trail is incredibly muddy you may have some issues.They are kind of heavy for what they are.I didnt like the toe strap.  Feels really weird to me.

I use the  person tent as a one man tent.  If you are expecting to hang out in your tent dont get this style for  people.

Bears will for the most part avoid you and if you cross paths with them youre usually good if you make some noise. Mountain lions are probably the most terrifying of them all since you never know theyre there until its too late. I remember one time when I was probably ten hiking off trail and suddenly there wasnt a sound. No wind no birds no deer. Nothing. It creeped me right the hell out so I decided to head back. It wasnt too long before I noticed massive cat prints not just next to but inside of my own. Its not a good feeling being stalked.  As far as protection goes there really isnt a gun that will help defend you against an angry bear. A grizzly can still charge you for something like  yards without its heart.

Youre not going to be able to use an ultralight pack to shield your body from the attack of the zombie hordes or whatever. The packs you linked are super tough L  lb behemoths.

The bigger pot isnt super stable on something like a pocket rocket but if youre mostly boiling water and dont need to do a lot of stirring it gets the job done. Of course there are more stable canister stove designs available i.e. inverted canister models but at some weight penalty.

Youll get the odd storm here and there much more in WA if you finish late but overall you dont need so much extra clothing.  You already have a set of clothes for sleeping so you really just need one set for hiking in.  If you do have multiple days of rain you just wear the wet hiking clothes and keep the sleeping clothes dry.  Adding extra clothes that will only get wet in an hour or two doesnt help.  Similarly I would replace that towel with a bandanna.  Was about to suggest a down jacket but you have one in the worn category you wont be wearing that while hiking much....

It is a constant battle though! You must be relentless and you will spend more time on injury prevention than youd like. Accept it now or later  You are on the right path as far as strengthening the glutes... What is your fitness like right now both aerobic and strength? Did you jump into the PCT training trip pretty cold or are you feeling pretty fit? As you probably know increasing intensity or duration too fast is a quick way to get injured. Keep up the strength routine. You will likely want to keep doing this during your trip. If you need help with exercise ideas let me know but if you think you got it thats good just keep at it. Yoga  I used to think yoga was a fancy name for stretching. Over the past  years Ive found that is not the case. I always do a select few poses at camp at night time.

Ghost Whisperer Very expensive wait for sales freaking light but there are warmer jackets that are similarly priced  weight.  I would add the Montbell Superior Down Parka hood to your list. It is cheaper than all your options warmer and has a great rep. It is a little heavier than the Ghost Whisperer at .oz. I think that the Ghost Whisperers fabric is more comfortable but for almost half the price the Montbell is the clear winner in my book.

11433646,0,t3_637ztl,You can check out a few shugemery videos on underquilts to get an idea of the suspension. I have two answers for you. First answer is No. The burrow is not designed with a differential cut meaning that it is not shaped to elimante the possibility of compression underneath the user. This means that it will be compressed under you and basically be rendered useless. Secondly the UQ requires a shock cord suspension that typically is clipped up to the gathered end on your hammock. The burrow is also tapered most likely so it again is not the best option whatsoever and if you are going to hang as an alternative to tenting you should invest in an UQ that is made specifically for that.Second Answer Yes. You could ghettorig the burrow under the hammock and might get  percent of the rated temperature out of it. You would need to modify it to accept shock cord through the entire perimeter or at least at all four corners. The little loops on the burrow are for ground pad attachment .S,Ultralight,dfrzqaq,1,t5_2s7p2

Join the Backcountry Meal planning FB group and really dig into the caloriedenseweightefficient foods that are key to staying UL. Identify where youre hiking couldnt tell from the OP and realize that youre probably afraid youll run out of water when you wont. Also just because your pack is rated to  lbs doesnt mean if you put  lbs in it its going to break. Sometimes you have to load up higher than the rating no way around it.

11689024,0,t1_dgkc0g9,I agree with these comments from my own experience. I use my MLD Burn when I can but no matter how long the trip I limit it to lbs total including L of water. This usually limits its use to  night trips without a bear can. Even at lns or less I wont carry a bear can in it. For longer trips I use my HMG  which has a stay and hip belt. I know its become pretty glamorous to rock a frameless and belt less pack. I get it it does look nice but in my experience when you start approaching lbs in one of these tiny packs my shoulders begin to get sore. I have an athletic build but would never refer to myself as strong or weak. I think if youre willing to hike with a base weight around  lbs then its definitely doable for longer hikes. Ive accepted that I wont ever drop my base weight that low. Mine falls into the lbs range depending on the trip. YMMV ,Ultralight,dgkyvxo,3,t5_2s7p2

11774084,0,t3_6803yr,If the disparity between your two types of trips is so great I would maybe think about having two packs. Overnight solo hike vs. two week hike with gear for two people is basically directly opposite sides of the spectrum. I understand not everyone can blow the  for two HMG packs so maybe weigh the frequency of your two types of trips if youre doing more solo lighter trips maybe get the  as your expensive pack and have a backup larger one for other trips and vice versa if longer andor person hikes are more frequent pick the  as your expensive pack.I personally started with a L GG Mariposa found it to be a lot more volume than I need so I now also have a L GG Murmur.
