Russia the US ISIS and the Assad regime are all there doing whatever they are doing. What is your average male refuge supposed to do in this situation? Meh.... Lately and especially during that GoG show where Colin went off. Ive really wished there was someone around to check Colin when he starts getting really political on topics and current events. I enjoy hearing his opinion but I find myself very disappointed that none of the other guys are able to check some of the things hes saying with pretty basic facts and argument points that can be made by anyone whose been paying attention to the news. At the very least it would lead to more interesting discussions than what we get.

6852498,0,t3_49je2d,Thought on Uncharted stories I tend to be more extreme than Greg and Colin in my view that Uncharted stories are very different. Each game has really different themes and explores a new facet of Nate.Uncharted  Pretty classic Hero Tale. Nate is introduced as an underdog trying to prove a quack theory and legitimize the greatness of his family and his ancestor. We think Sully may betray Drake but not really. Theres a supernatural twist.Uncharted  We learn that Nate may not be the good guy presented in the first game. It seems he is pretty familiar with heists and such. The game revolves around him questioning if he really is a good guy. Can he be a hero? Flynn actually does betray Nate. There is a supernatural twist.Uncharted  Explores Nates upbringing his relation with Sully and goes back to Nates need to find greatness no matter the costs. Asks the question is what Nates doing worth it? What is important to him? No betrayal. Psychological twist. So there are common plot elements but to say the stories are too similar is just wrong in my opinion. I think Uncharted  is going to look at the part of Nates life with Sam that weve never seen before. I think Nate decided to let go of his need for crazy adventures now he values the people around him most. Sam is going to make Nate question that and try to get him to abandon it for the old life they lived together. ,kindafunny,d0t1er8,1,t5_2vhlq

I dont know how to say that in a way that sounds good. But its become clear that there is an unfathomable anount of arrogance from some people that are basically saying take it or leave it and unwilling to compromise or listen to criticism. Heres the thing  if Colin wants to talk about politics he should absolutely have a platform for that and for people to come and listen to him. But it should not be the Game Over Greggy show anymore. To be honest we see that it wears on you Tim and Nick and makes the whole thing less fun for everyone involved. It hampers the quality in general. There are some cases when serious topics need to be discussed thats not what I am saying. But if all were going to hear on political topics is Colin talk down and borderline insult anyone that doesnt agree with him it needs to stop. Ive seen the way he talks to Tim in particular and its disheartening.
