Buying things repeated wont be so bad if the gift menu would stay open so you dont have to click through all those screens.,crushcrush,d3mg5ph,4,t5_3ciqm

Sure I dont go see a lot because of the price usually only ones I really want to see.Ive played the Kong version of this game back when Pamu was the last girl to finish and Im playing again on Nutaku because a a good dating sim should have boobs!I figure for all the time Ive spent enjoying this game a fiver was a good token of thank you to the devs who probably only see  of it but whatever!. Call it a tip for good service!,crushcrush,d9udu6i,5,t5_3ciqm
