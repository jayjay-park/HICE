491740,0,t3_1zg2v6,Hi there.  My wife and I have lived on Prospect Hill for  years now and love it.  Our favorite local pub is the Mad Raven and go to Fulcinittis for our pizza thin crust.  Dominics is our sandwich shop.  Hannaford is a hair more expensive than Stop n Shop but we cant argue the convenience.  Anyways I am a licensed builder and flip houses.   I start my next project in Waltham! in a couple weeks but until then I am unemployed.   I typically dont do contract work but seeing how you have qualified the job as some repair work we may be able to work out something that works out for both of us.  Send me a message and I will send you a link to my company that contains pictures of my work.  You may then contact me if you would like some honest ideas on cost and time.   No worries if not.   Disclaimer I have been a lurker for over a year now and am just getting the reddit thing down.  I apologize if I have broken any rules here for self promotion.  Please unconfuse me if I have.   ,Waltham,cfw5x7a,3,t5_2slpn

3378471,0,t1_cpdcebl,Small probably because it started snowing earlier but fun! It was great to meet roosterofdragons and meltinginside. We sat at the bar and basically just hung out for a couple of hours nice low key evening. Well definitely try another one.,Waltham,cpdddc6,1,t5_2slpn
3816693,0,t3_34560a,I did a little dance for joy while snapping these pics my first Imgur post to Reddit  hope I did it right.  The contractor has delivered them over to the old Fernald Center on Trapelo.  This means there is an end in sight!,Waltham,cqrc0mc,2,t5_2slpn
9414295,0,t3_59bvp6,Ill agree with The Gaff and Wild Willys being good. I also agree that Relish isnt anything special. My favorite burger is probably the ultimate turkey burger at Jake n Joes but theyve got a lot of other interestinggood options.,Waltham,d99bszw,2,t5_2slpn
9877229,0,t1_dao6tjd,I second this. They also have a W. Newton location. Both are awesome. Knowledgeable coaches great community. Its more costly than a traditional gym but you get what you pay for.,Waltham,dav0xz4,2,t5_2slpn
10195525,0,t1_dbwgea8,This is good advice. My SO and his old roommate got a  bed house for   years ago by scanning Craigslist. They pounced about an hour after it was posted. Another friend found a great place by taking a chance on a post with no photos. It takes some work but you can find good deals that way.,Waltham,dbzpw20,1,t5_2slpn

11723799,0,t3_66i858,Yeah I wasnt too impressed after hearing about how great Watch City Brewing was. I moved here after they closed unfortunately.I really like The Gaff but the place is just too small and always packed it seems.,Waltham,dgox8g8,1,t5_2slpn
