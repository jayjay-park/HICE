1019852,0,t1_chf36q1,This is a little more subtle let me give it a try.A common misconception is that Science describes the reality exactly as it is but really it is just a model that can explain how things work the distinction is super important. Models do have limits and they evolve with new discoveries but depending on what you what to explain and under what conditions they can be admitted true. Most of the time in physics the maths can describe a situation adequately so the maths is the model. After that you can interpret the model how you want but then you are exiting the field of Science. Why? Because in Science if you cannot under the current set of laws make an experiment that can split between two interpretations they are equivalents. Interpretation is the way you try to vulgarize the maths but in the end it is always an oversimplification and is by definition less precise than the maths behind it.So Physics evolve by finding holes in the maths and patching them while leaving the interpretation to metaphysics. The latter is not Science because you cant prove or disprove an interpretation of a currently valid model except by finding holes in the maths!. In the end metaphysics is incompatible with the scientific theory and doesnt help to figure how things work but why things work.,quantum,chk7q1q,3,t5_2r871

2571831,0,t3_2p7n7n,Its hard to understand your question as worded but it sounds like what youre saying is mostly equivalent to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation the interference pattern observed in the double slit experiment is described by the branching ratios of different possible universes each occurring a weighted infinite number of times in the multiverse of parallel universes. The fact that we only observe one outcome is a result of us being confined to a single possible history though we can recover some indication of whats happening in the multiverse by repeating the experiment multiple times. Still this doesnt necessarily require a th dimension for the multiverse to exist in. Although its weird and one of the many complaints about the many worlds interpretation that the many worlds interpretation requires an infinity of infinities of universes to explain even a single event each of these events are universes are less like parallel universes existing together in some things as eigenstates of a superposition of universes each experiencing itself as real but in no way coexisting instead being superimposed. The phenomena of wave collapse is explained by all events being confined to a single eigenstate of reality. ,quantum,cmu9z1f,1,t5_2r871

3323723,0,t1_cp6sik9,Thats it.We are in an area where we have some data and were trying to make sense of it. The way we move forwards is to guess the underlying processes and then work out what predictions our guess makes so we can test it. This is how science moves forwards. A few ideas will die quickly when the implications dont happen in the lab and probably the best will just end up as theory mark  as we move forwards.I dont like strings but a theory does not stand or fall by getting likes but by reproducible predictions. Nobody really likes quantum mechanics but it works.,quantum,cp74rvd,4,t5_2r871
3563987,0,t1_cpxjwth,I find this video on the SternGerlach experiment helpful. This experiment exposed spin as a physical property of matter. As to the question what the spinvalue really mean I cant give a good explanation other than it is the value of the physical property called spin sorry!. It is like asking what does the charge value of a particle means it is simply some fundamental property affecting the particle behaviour. We are just more familiar with charge because we can play with humanscale magnets.As for youre second question there are two different phenomena. First the spin naturally processes with time while the particle doesnt really spin the mathematical representation of an electron spin is a spinning vector on a sphere and so we say the spin processes but we can take that into consideration when we make our measurement. That means most of the time we measure the particle in a spinning referentialframe that counters the natural spin procession.The second thing is superposition. An electron spin can be in state  in state  or in a superposition of both! A superposition of states is not one state and another fluctuating it is really BOTH at the same time in a very precise way. However when you measure a state in superposition you observe  or  with certain fixed probabilities. The result you get will have some level of randomness true randomness if we take localityrealism granted which cannot be explained by a lack of knowledge hidden variables. The interpretation of the measure is the metaphysical point where scientists divide.Its hard to explain superposition more convincingly without a blackboard I admit my paragraph above is kinda sloppy.  However if it really interests you I suggest you read this article If you understand the figure  you will understand what superposition really means without having to do the maths!,quantum,cpyirjk,3,t5_2r871

8536147,0,t3_4wmf82,I was about to say no but I suppose you could under unrealistically ideal circumstances. I also suspect that there would be a classical scheme for verifying the identity that is more practical and simpler. Regardless you could basically adapt the BB protocol to generate and then read a pair of tags one of which you attach to your object and another that you store securely. The primary practical issue would be storing entangled particles more or less indefinitely without the entanglement decaying. Currently the most advanced experiments have seconds before the entangled particles decay exception entangled photons but those are quite hard to keep in one place for long. Addendum To be clear you dont entangle macroscopic objects. You could use entanglement but not in the way you seem to be implying or imagining.,quantum,d68l2dr,1,t5_2r871

9950427,0,t1_db4i016,gtif the data is deleted off the instrument the particle will act as though never measuredThis isnt accurate.  The interaction ie with polarizers that initially measures or marks the system has a permanent and indelible effect on it.  Erasure is a secondary filtering process.  gtthe electrons interaction with the slit itself would cause it to collapse which obviously means none of this stuff would be a thing.It does.  Sometimes it collapses into the state where it went through the slit openings and sometimes it collapses into the state where it hits the slit mask and just gets absorbed.  The latter case are ignored as uninteresting in normal accounts of the double slit.,quantum,db4kej4,1,t5_2r871

If you do not have the knowledge to understand the mathematics of a paper and are not very familiar with the language that people like to use to describe certain quantum phenomena then it is hard to find out what the actual consensus is and what is deviating from it.Anyway I guess it is a good rule of thumb to be very suspicious about anything that connect consciousness to quantum mechanics and you can also safely disregard anything that suggests quantum mechanics supports the notion that consciousness is creating the material world.,quantum,dgig3wm,1,t5_2r871
