1884826,0,t3_2g6gqn,Take a look at the Ultimarc U joystick it even does analog.  I have  on each of my MAME machines.  And the support for them cant be beat!I am using those in combination with Xpadder and LED Blinky.  Havent looked back since.,HyperSpin,ckgbbby,1,t5_2ugn0
3296268,0,t3_2xtli0,Through trial and error mostly error Ive found the minimum specs you need to make Hyperspin run smoothly is dual core or core duo . GHz with  gigs of ram if youre running a  bit version of Windows and  gigs for  bit.  Anything less than that and it will run like shit.,HyperSpin,cp401me,1,t5_2ugn0
3754234,0,t3_339g7z,These are awesome  thanks much!,HyperSpin,cqk7kdh,1,t5_2ugn0
4493084,0,t1_cswqzio,You can turn it onoff for each system. HLRL HQ has drop down menus for each system to allow you to set things e.g. fades bezels etc. to follow the Global or individual settings.,HyperSpin,csx0gsu,1,t5_2ugn0

4593821,0,t1_cpje16j,It really sucks to have to manually rename all of the files. Thats what im dealing with now. Thanks for the reference to Hyperspin checker. I dont think i had any luck with Hypersync.,HyperSpin,ct9n6nv,1,t5_2ugn0
4774722,0,t1_ctwcs4c,On another note I really had no idea about the sentiment being displayed here. Somebody should have inboxed me there first cause now I just got my back up from your directed hostility. And like I said a ban cant keep me off the site. Ive got lots of resources to work from your efforts are going to be rendered futile. Its not like I dont know what the fuck Im doing if Im the only one in history who has made a torrent like this. I am rather tech savvy.And your cloud for distributing content sucks anyways. What good is being a god damn member if most of the content sucks. ,HyperSpin,ctwe9yg,8,t5_2ugn0
4861472,0,t3_3heneu,Sounds like you do not have RL setup properlyOpen up the UI and capture a screenshot of the MAME setup in RLUI I want to see the emualtor path defiend rom extensions and ROM path.Also please show paths to you ROMS and MAME.exe.I assume you are using RL to audit your ROMS if not please confirm what you are using.  Most likely culprit is the setup of your ROM extenstions.,HyperSpin,cu7bpyc,1,t5_2ugn0
4951888,0,t3_3g7umb,Updated the thread with the new format of the torrents.,HyperSpin,cuiq4im,1,t5_2ugn0
5108630,0,t1_cv1s156,Thats fine youll know who to blame when all of it goes underground.,HyperSpin,cv1s54n,1,t5_2ugn0
5118600,0,t1_cuyrn20,Yes hopefully. ,HyperSpin,cv2zehl,1,t5_2ugn0
6086191,0,t3_3y35d9,Its pretty cool but looks like it is a little over engineered.  The stick in the same path as the trackball seems odd but its cool to have the option for lefties.  This set up will save on space in the house too. ,HyperSpin,cyhdn6l,1,t5_2ugn0
8904646,0,t3_4e1ifm,Im having the same problem. Do I have to donate money to get a validation mail?,HyperSpin,d7i7k5l,1,t5_2ugn0
9326497,0,t3_587fgl,i dont like hyperspin for big collections,HyperSpin,d8y7adf,1,t5_2ugn0

11457317,0,t3_63j5kh,The easiest solution here is to just change the mapping. Generally you shouldnt be ever using shift space crtl alt for any controls as you may activate a combination you otherwise wouldnt want activated. Although usually its a letter one of those.Since your using a keymapped controller your not using a gameemulator that would need those settings so dont worry about it. Just change the mapping. You might also want to consider using something like retroarch or another global emulator so you wont have the problem of switching every keymap. Alternatively  Joykey features individual profiles based on the process running you could make another profile that is linked to the emulators .exe  it will default back when the process is no longer running.editP.S Do you have the latest version of rocketlauncher? I suggest updating if not. It may fix the issue.,HyperSpin,dfuog4c,2,t5_2ugn0
11802341,0,t1_dgxtazv,Id be concerned about the video being pulled or some connectivity issue... the live option while a cool concept might have problems ,HyperSpin,dgxu49n,1,t5_2ugn0
