Hp skill cool down attack dodge etc. If you have bad cards spend a few days farming rifts during hot times. Second watch some play videos. You need to be able to make your moves as soon as the boss does so you can use the iframes at the right moment. Also keep a set of healing blobs available at all times as a spare then each time you cast use the old ones to heal before they poof. You need an emergency supply at all times.

They either kill her or end up in a draw. There isnt much you can do about it. if they end up fighting between themselves there is nothing you can do but wait for a draw. Its like the Throot vs. Throot problem at the scale of the entire game.Worse part is you dont get to enjoy the game anymore. Everyone does either one hit damage or never dies.

8162111,0,t3_4r0wl7,It really depends on what you are doing.  Basic game strategy for story mode is get one hero to max level and use them to power level other heroes quickly.  Best option is to work on those that are easily farmable.  Best suggestions would be Black Widow  missions Giant Man easiest quickest special Ultron  missions  special. Granted Ultron is the least powerful but definitely most bios per day.  GM is powerful but squishy at higher levels.  Black Widow iMO is the strongest of those  but least speedy to farm as well as not getting great until they get their  move.My recommendation would be GM for the simple reason that he gets strongest the fastest.  And with no  move he becomes his strongest the earliest of the .  Granted at that point youll definitely want to focus on heroes with more endgame potential.,future_fight,d4xt8es,1,t5_3eui5
8163167,0,t1_d4xsamr,You more than likely wont get three teams out of those guys until everyone is maxed gearsskillsgood iso sets.Iron Man is fairly useless other than his leadership.  Hes pretty fast but his attacks leave him wide open so unless you get really good at reading the WB patterns he wont help much.  Floki obviously should be able to get you a win if he is geared.  I would pair him with IM leadership for the cooldown reduction to get permanent clonesshield.  So possibly a IMFlokiGroot team maybe.Blingpin is pretty good but not by himself.  Maybe you could pull a win off with DeathlokBlingpinSilk but I dont think you have the strikers for it.  Silk is actually really useful against the WB due to her  star being a shield like Loki.  The only problem is that her webs dont work on the WB so you still need to know the boss patterns really well so you dont start attacking when they are going to multihit your shield off.Groot I dont find all that useful in WB.  Maybe if you got him to T for that extra heal but most of the WB dont give you time to stand in his heal but I believe he puts it out as a striker sometimes.  Someone else can probably comment on that since I dont use him.Deathlok is fairly useless for WB except for his leadership.  His attacks take too long and leave him wide open.  Others have said they get WB kills with DaisyWarwolfIF but I havent had any success with that team.  But IF is a great striker.  He is when attacking and hits like a truck.  HB is actually much better against the WB than I originally thought he would be.  He is fairly tanky does tons of damage and has a great leadership so you could swap him out with Deathlok for a HBBlingpinSilk team.MK doesnt really do much against the WB until hes T.  My T MK can facetank the world bosses for the most part not BD or iThanos with minimal paying attention.  Some of the bosses like EM or Proxima can one shot him between the time his heal goes off and the time its ready again but if youre paying attention it should be fine.  He is a when hit striker so not that useful BUT he gives you  extra damage to WB.TLDR  I dont see three teams there but I see two possible ones.  IMFlokiGroot and Deathlokor HBBlingpinSilk.  ,future_fight,d4xxzun,1,t5_3eui5

She does good to great when controlling her against one of the WBs and as a striker it is like she reduces their total I dont think all Ts are game changers. I havent heard much noise from people like Rocket Vision War Machine Hawk Eye Bucky etc. Even Iron Man isnt a game changer in my Opinion but its hard to say that when I saw the video of him  KOing Proxmia. ,future_fight,d54ah72,2,t5_3eui5

8223013,0,t3_4rzjfy,At this point where you are in the game dont focus so much on winning or climbing the ranks but rather on completing  TL battles a day. You get  honor tokens per battle even if you lose. Compared to other games where youd be SOL if you lose a battle thats downright generous. At least MFF gives us a little something in return for the trouble.Save up the honor tokens you get then spend them useful things from the token shop when you have enough.  lost battles a day still means  honor tokens.While youre doing this keep working on leveling up and upgrading your characters. Soon enough youll get to the point where youll be winning more consistently and youll climb the ranks then.Everyone goes through this at the start. Just keep working at it and soon youll be winning more and more battles. And then eventually youll be wondering how the hell you got bumped up to platinum league when you all you wanted to do was keep collecting those sweet sweet honor tokens like me.ETA Wow this turned into a novel somehow.

Shes been in two movies of theirs and hasnt her origin been rewritten in the comics too?I can understand them not marketing Quicksilver since hes  Dead in the MCU and  Now one of FOXs most notable characters but I dont feel its rational for them to not be marketing the hell out of their version of Wanda.I have to believe its that they want to wait until the movies give her a more defined powerset or that theyre waiting to add more sophisticated gameplay mechanics perhaps Dr. Strange will bring the first iteration of some unique effects to add her.

Otherwise people tend to use that sub to max paywall characters.  Toons you cannot farm or buy using other bio selectors Carnage or Hyperion.  There are lots of other potential candidates that are hard to farm like Silk Hulkbuster Sister Grimm Ant man Wasp Angela Moonknight Elsa She Hulk and Singularity.  I would say generally people do not us the sub to buy characters farmable in story or special missions.  Hope that helps.,future_fight,d596f5u,2,t5_3eui5

8254511,0,t1_d59cri8,Uhhh.. so I found something that may or may not be why we dont seem to see any actual change with the stat...return Mathf.MaxGlobal.constant.MAXARMORPENETRATE penetrateDamageRate  Basically no matter what your Defense Penetration rate is... they always return the larger of the two values... Id guess from everything i know that should be Min not Max..gtedit Most backwards way ever to do that but basically you always get .defense penetration  or the larger value if you have more. Confusing as heck because the value is named MAXARMORPENETRATE but its really a minimum the way its coded. Skill cooldown functions the exact same way.As to how it wouldnt factor I see what you mean and i think alot of this stems from my attempt to simplify the logic. Heres how it really breaks down using more explicit names for the factorsdamageReduceFactor  f  DefenseAfterPentration  DefenseAfterPentration  target.DamageReduceFactor  floathitter.levelthen it doesdamageReduceFactor  damageReduceFactor  f  target.GetDamageReduceRateWithHitDatahitData  damageReduceFactor  Mathf.ClampdamageReduceFactor f fwhere target.GetDamageReduceRateWithHitData essentially is pulling any defensive buff values the target has.Also ive pmd you a link if you want to take a peek.As i mentioned im working on an actual calculator so ill be able to see more clearly what you are talking about.

Pretty much all the WBs share this same mechanic unfortunately.For myself personally this is why I dont bother with the current boss mechanics because its just another layer of difficulty that I dont need to stress myself over.

You misunderstood my comment and keep telling me about the auto play while my comment was for the coop in overall. Trying to be elitist in a toilet game that the only skill required is a credit card. Hmm what a life you must led. What you call trash is a factor in this game and most common that you think. Blame the developers for poor balance between characterbosses power levels not the players which are given the option to participate in this game mode with trash. A new player has not many options in the grind hunt but to dive into this shit patienly kicked in private rooms or doomed to leavereenter in quick match. Even in manual some bosses like doc oc venom destroyer are undoable with shitty . So my point was that the developers must balance this in a way that these characters can compete or change the requirements to participate to  stars level or something. ,future_fight,d658ybc,1,t5_3eui5

People have jobs families live in a time zone that the hot time event doesnt benefit them. Yes. It is very very situational. It isnt there to begin with and it demands someone to find and open the exact rift when you need it. Then you have to be hasty to fill one of the  spots so you can farm it and for  minutes you cant afford to do anything else. I dont judge by my self but when you think of improvement and need to be objective you have to take into account every parameter. And how exactly  people gives you  rifts when you are limited to one per day? ,future_fight,d6di587,2,t5_3eui5

8715434,0,t3_4za77d,I have her at T and I disagree that she is worth Ting currently.  IF is a much better use of T mats for ABTLWBwhich you did say.  She just isnt that great of a character other than she gets that  second invulnerable.  Her damage is really low for a T as well imo.  There are better characters for TL so I just dont see the use unless you really like her character.  Any BO I have two T SR T IF T Groot all of these are people I would make sure you had before you even tried to get White Tiger to T.Personally I dont like using T characters that take longer than  minute to kill the WB.  SR IF and Proxima are my three T characters that I can do all sub  minute kills.  Ive used White Tiger and she hasnt taken less than  and thats with me going full on facetanking not caring about not having my shield up.  It takes even longer if you are just running around.  I think she is a solid th out of the  new characters since Songbird Wiccan Gwenpool and Squirrel Girl all seem to do tons of damage very quickly.  I havent tried them on WB at T yet but from the videos Ive seen they all absolutely wreck the WB.  I actually regret upgrading her to T.  Her shield is great as long as you interrupt the animation.  Otherwise you waste  seconds of the  seconds just standing around because of the skill animation.,future_fight,d6v2fuq,1,t5_3eui5

Or at least make the rewards better for IThanos or raise the number of times you can beat them daily. I hate the new Timeline I cant really play on auto anymore and dont have time to play them manually or just dont want to.  Even Tier s can give my Thanos a tough time if Im not paying attention.  Kind of ridiculous.  Bring back rewards for friends running your rifts.  The completion bar is dumb and I dont always want to burn all of my energy on rifts.  It was much better the way it was. I love the new farmable characters but it kind of sucks that I can only do one at a time.  And it seems like Im not getting as many bios as I used to.  I wish they would have left the drop rate alone.  Im sure there will be a new batch of Ts the question is who. I think they should do some more tieins with the MCU to help promote each other.  Seemed like it worked well for Civil War but other than that they have done nothing. They never did release DD season  uniforms I wonder if they ever will.  AOS season  starts next month they could do a tie in with that.  Luke Cage will be about the same time.  This is a good post that list some other possibilities. ,future_fight,d6xseon,0,t5_3eui5

BW is kinda dumb in my opinion.  Similar story to TL.  Whats great about her though is you can use her as a lead to farm other stuff and especially at T shes really fast.  ,future_fight,d7paoru,3,t5_3eui5

At least thats my impression about it.And its definitely not as easy as a Floki AB.edit I had the same problem problems like you but got rid of it after some trial and error in AB. Its definitely like all others said. Just  repeat. I always got hit in the transition phase from  to . The timing is crucial so you can minimize the time you are vulnerable. You still get hit from time to time but you can heal that with your blobs. I dont have  cd so i definitely need  as a filler to have  ready before  ends and youre vulnerable. Mine scd is  plus the th gear whatsoever i get from all scd. And my obelisk is guard break crit rate  dmg proc.Vs Thanos i used only  and  though i guess  would also work. I ran around like a headless chicken after  until i felt  would be ready once i used . Rinse repeat  first Thanos kill and imo a lot easier than clearing AB.

Because most enemy wont regist it and help you survive better against the enemy on rumble stage you will need a good  star thats top tier or a tier  that can face tank or have shield and again have status skill save all your good tier  for this youll need them on stage  rumble stage with the new avengers hulking have physical damage reflect so try to kill him with an energy atker fast then kill song bird cause shell bind and stun like hell wiccan have insane damage with energy reflectdamn I know you  are a couple but come on but hes pretty squishy lucky us kill him fast then worry about the other both white tiger and squirrel girl have stun and have relatively high damage so be careful.

9053375,0,t1_d7zvtzd,gt Im sorry but i dont agree that some modes arent for some people.. Exclusivity died with World of Warcraft when it went casual. Games should be encouraging inclusiveness and not shutting out half the playerbase.I dont know how you managed to get disconnected from civilization for all these years to think that is true but welcome back to Earth. First some history lesson If you look at the VIP levels in Future Fight youll see similarities to hundreds of other games made by asian companies several years ago with one of the highest point being the chinese browser games made to attract whales who would spend up to k in a game eventually more. Their developers would release a game sometimes just copying some other successful title then promote the hell out of it a couple days later a new server would be released and another and another then merge old servers and keep releasing more up to hundreds of servers or thousands if the game was profitable enough so more whales could spend and race to the top of rankings. Things like VIP Level buy extra attempts on timeline spend crystals to revivecontinue are taken from this markets textbook just like many other mobile games do. So inclusiveness?Yea...right.With that being said except for Carnage and Hyperion who are behind a paywall and T advancement which is limited the game gives enough for you to grow your roster. Answering your other comment the reason why people downvoted you is because Shadowlands was very well received its challenging maybe the best mode in the game its fun and give a lot of rewards which you can use to get to higher levels. This game screwed up badly a lot in the past but Shadowlands is great and it shouldnt be changed. You can either grind at your own pace or spend you cant have everything for free and fast thats ridiculous and would break the game.,future_fight,d802kle,2,t5_3eui5

The only reason I dont have more six characters is because I have no interest in them right now. Maybe this will change later but right now I have no interest in MODOK. Getting crystals isnt as hard as it sounds its just we have to be pickyer than others because we cant magically get more when were in a bind. Getting characters to Lv  gives  crystals. Once you get to a certain point in story mode this becomes easy. Completing the daily achievements gives  easy crystals each day. Depending on how good you are timeline battle gives    crystals a week with minimal effort. There are also many many events where we get free crystals and tickets that let you skip character grind. Three of my teir s are because of some whinner who was mad he didnt have as much as the people who actually payed for it so I got three teir  tickets.

Now I really wanted to finish CG and not ing him and going for strange means hes going to stay at  for a fairly long time. But its Dr. Strange man...Should I skip over Corvus I can currently  and floor  SL with my current roster and just save up for Strange in hopes to get him done a little earlier? or will finishing Corvus give me a needed boost?I would still need to  or   the other new characters but with  selectors saved up and the boost from the subscription Im thinking doing this will greatly speed up the process.Thanks in advance for the advice!,future_fight,d98imp3,1,t5_3eui5

You want to or you think you have to or you feel obliged to but actually you dont have to. You want to or feel obliged to do AB BW x y z but you dont have to. Indeed no one has to.Its about time management. If you only have . hours available to spare in this game then it is your responsibility to do good time management. You should minmax calculate which modes give you the most resources that you think are most significant to you in the shortest time and which modes are less efficient and decide which modes are of higher priority and play them first and which are of lower priority and play them later or just dont play them. Your aim is to get the most out of the . hours.The choreness  repetitiveness in TLB and BWD and maybe some other modes too but I think TLB and BWD are the most serious is definitely an issue but that is another topic.So you either change your mentality and change your habit  your OCD and start planning your time management decide the priority of each game modes or ... what else can you do just deal with it? I dont know.,future_fight,d9mkk1r,1,t5_3eui5
9520977,0,t3_5b42i1,So given how useful Wasp is is she worth spending  and  rankup tickets on? I think she can solo a low combat rumble in SL? Which would help me save good characters like YJ and TSR for later. Mine is  with  bios and Ive still got plenty of other rifts to run. I also have four  and two soon   tickets.Roster Any other suggestions for the tickets?

Some characters only show up in type specific combat etc. selectors like Shulkie and Singularity.  Other characters can only be farmed as shifters.  Bio subscription selectors will give you any character you want.  That includes Hyperion and Carnage but also characters that only available as shifters like Gwen Poole and Clea.

9877720,0,t3_5gt1s6,my opinion of the update that I posted elsewhere Odin hopefully he is on same tier as thanos amp Dr.Strange.. His t amp leadership seems built to counter Strange.. And hopefully alot of Iframes.. Enchantress t passive seems decent not bad but not great either.. would have even better if either invulnerability or higher guaranteed dodge was added since alot of heavy hitters in the game lately and dodge seems not enough these days.. but the other passive seems interesting.. for a paywall i hope she is as strong as carnage and hyperion... not sure if she is worth an instant t.. gonna wait and see.. Hela looks like a solid leadership and gonna be a part of meta... her normal passive is basically just like a watered down version of Maw amp Cleas passives hopefully Helas summons can draw aggro like Hellstorms minions.. T seems mediocre with just another dodge boost but hopefully the debuff effect boost is decent.. And hopefully her debuff skills are decent... another wait and see if she is worth an instant t ticket.. Ulik Not sure what to think of him yet... aside from a couple of stuns he seemed pvpbw based kind of hero... tier seems decent as well but i think not worth an instant t ticket.. Fandral no crowd control.. T seems mediocre and not worth an instant t unless the boost to the typoed skill is good.. seems his warriors  summon is fun to use.. hopefully he has alot of iframes to make him worth an investment and usage.. Hogun nice leadership.. T seems similar with Miles Morales and Kaecilus havent ted both so cant comment how good Hoguns t will be.. Has crowd control skills and a warriors  summon could make him worth a look.. Volstagg He basically got She Hulks t passivsalbeit just the defense boost for free lol.. leadership seems average and t seems decent it seems he is built for shadowlands.. has a warriors  summon has Sharon Rogers star ability has a crowd control has a boost amp damage immunity skill.. It seems of the warriors  Volstagg is the one worth investing.. Sif new costume looks rad but not a must buy due to crappy effect only buy for stat boost... hopefully the new uni changes alot of her skills and make her solid option.. t seems mediocre and not worth an instant t ticket.. Silk looks is a bonus.. getting spideys passive in exchange for crystals lol poor spidey needs some love.. it seems worth to get Thor uni has decent effect it seems better than what is current available.. hopefully it gives him iframes on his skills.. t ability on the other hand seems decent that damage boost barrierimmunity pierce makes the t passive a somewhat less disappointing note.. i wished the t passive got a healing effect or invulnerabity instead.. Cap Marvel the changes to her skills are a plus.. And the t passive seems really good boost for her.. She could be look like worth of a t ticket  usage.. gotta wait and see first.. World Boss Coop finally its here.. hopefully the rewards are decent and servers are stable compared to bw servers lol.. bios per day makes farming so much easier more food for BO.. malekith is now farmable and hopefully other asgardians like angela and jane foster are farmable too.. Uru downside of additional resource timesinkgoldsink.. hopefully NM gives as a free inventory storage slots.. it seems like the boosts this resource provides will make broken characters even more broken lol.. IMHO nothing from the Asgurdian update stands out to me as worth t upgrade compared to the Strange update.. Even with the improvements to Cap Marvel she is a wait amp see for me before Id invest on t upgrade her... Gonna save my mega t tix and  t tix for when loki and the rest of asgurdians get their ts.. When looking back at the Strange update after seeing the new characters on paper nearly all but wong and kaecilius screamed instant t upgrade for me.. And since about all the Strange characters have utility skillslike crowd control buff debuff heals it sweetens the temptation to t them...  With the Asgurdian update none stood out for me to instant t upgrade them... Their skills seems have enough utility to make them worth to lvl but the ts doesnt seem to impress me yet.. Gotta definitely have to wait after the maintenance to see if im wrong..,future_fight,dav38za,3,t5_3eui5

9885068,0,t1_daw1de1,gt NM did it and while it may be artificial difficulty to a certain extent there is still a ton of skill involved in the fact that if you screw up the timing of your iframes youre pretty fucked too.The skill is there when talking about iThanos who can strip you of your safe buffs do things that stop your actions when he goes to do his meteors which coincidentally is also an action thats largely unavoidable you cant avoid EVERY meteor.Here? Nope. T Carnage will win after a few lifetimes.gt Dodge is actually a working stat against these bosses too. Had many lucky dodges with silk T as well.Wouldnt know. They bypass most of it although a lot of it has to do with the level disadvantage.gt not knowing their skill rotationsKnowing their rotation is pointless when in Surturs case hes smacking the entire arena and likely OHKOing you unless youre literally not there to take the damage.gt Checking your previous posts it seems you were stuck at surtur. Took me a while to figure it out but exploiting the chokepoint from where you came in helps a lot in isolating him and making him focus his attacks. Knowing his attack patterns and when to use iframes helps a lot too.Yes no kidding. The problem is said iframe characters Ebony MawCarnage are safe wins. Theyre also agonizingly boring because you have to want to lose in order to not win But it takes forever to eventually win.You keep saying knowing this doing that and ending it with use iframes which is what Ive been saying the entire time but you keep reaching the conclusion I do while still claiming Im wrong and youre right. Is my opinion only right when you say it?Slogfests are not very interesting.gt Why? Because of artificial difficulty. No matter what others may say Im not going to be able to kill  WBs with buffed hp within a span of  minutes.The time limit was brutal although it was only because of Ebony Maw being a slowpaced fight. By the time EM is dead you generally didnt have enough time for BD.Expecting people to beat both of them especially with boosted stats in the same time as one was a bit... silly of a gameplay choice.Theres no skill to these bosses in Chapter  beyond having the patience to beat them. Slogfests arent hard or skillful.What do you think of certain platforming action games that feature the leap of faith? When you have to jump into a pit in which you dont know where you need to fall in order to be safe until after youve fallen in. Do you find those fun or difficult?What they did with these bosses is no different than if iThanos was just Thanos with nothing altered except having x the HP.Mega Man Zero had boring as hell hard modes because it was only hard by weakening your damage. Nothing else changed. You were weaker. Thats it. It took longer to get things done.,future_fight,daw1qfn,5,t5_3eui5

Corvus was a real MVP here as he has summons to distract Santa Claus. Santa killed them pretty quick but Corvus was able to do a lot of damage on the side.

9948139,0,t1_db493kq,gt In the first case the match will end very quickly so it should be fine that you dont get the first place reward.Currently I like matches ending quickly but if its a case of firs player is likely to get a blue chest while second player is likely to get a green chest then Id rather the match take a minute longer and I come out on top than to finish fast and end up with a white chest. When were only talking a maximum difference of three minutes the time difference doesnt matter nearly as much as the reward differences. This is especially true since WBI is a timelimited activity where the chests you get take time to unlock so even if you blitz through every match the most you can do is three matches in a row and then you have to stop completely until your chests open. Even worst case scenario where every match takes  minutes and every chest is a white one youd still be stuck waiting for that first chest to unlock at the end of the third match.gtTBH I think its poor game design to have a mechanic that requires you to play for at least  seconds when matches can end in less than .Its fine game design if players are playing to the objective the poor design is in having completely random pugs where you have can have no faith that the other players know what theyre doing. ,future_fight,db49nns,1,t5_3eui5

Additionally I rarely recommend specific sets but for the top dog I feel its worth it and I considered Overdrive to be the best by a good margin  if your Cooldown on cards isnt riduculously low. Reason being that Overdrive wastes less stats than the other sets because his  caps Strange on many stats automatically. PoAH wastes attack speed and CritRate Hawks Eye pretty much wastes Dodge CD if you have a DefPen obelisk and can put some CDR on his th gear  which you absolutely should have and CritRate. Overdrive only wastes CritRate.But yeah if you want it cheap any attack set will do. I mean strictly speaking Strange could use...

The reason why you were able to lock down venom in Shadowland is because all Shadowland enemies have an annoying tendency to run away from iframes often avoiding you hits and ambushing you when youre vulnerable so in that case having iframes wont actually help you lock down your enemy and a skill with no iframes that can guardbreak is preferred against SL Bosses since before the update floor  venom treats you as a detectible target and will stay in your attack range during your Angelas  and  skills animations.,future_fight,dbhf335,0,t5_3eui5

AO also can solo  WB at T as well never tried her on Thanos or iThanos. Kaecilius and Clea just arent worth the investment. Problem with Clea is her survivability same with Kaecilius.

10347320,0,t1_dcgx18r,Do journey of growth because the  best starting options from heroes journey are farmable and not all that amazing anymore tbh. Starting out I would worry more about getting the right cards than iso sets. Loki will likely benefit you more with a heal set so you can more safely do regular AB and Black Dwarf WB who can do bleed damage. For SR most go for atk iso set but thats only when you get max or close cooldown reduction with cards  alliance bonus so her rd skill dmg immunity is up as often as possible. I would get StarLord Punisher  need cdr for th option Loki agent of asguard and marvel zombies for cards. Possibly Groot  for the last th slot. Those will give high def pen and can either roll cdr on th stat or have them as first  stats loki and zombies. They also drop from dimension rifts.As for journey of growth I would use them on Rulk. He will be a very easy win for regular combat AB if you arent planning on paying to get Carnage and also isnt farmable. With uni hell also be good for SL WB and is an excellent choice for T as well.Edit Use the daily bios to get Enchantress. I would save her bios and get a mega rank up ticket later when you get enough crystal so you can get her to  and work on her gears a bit with the extra bios. Shes excellent even at T and its a good option if you want to stay FP or even if you buy the bio subscription later as there is no other way to get paywall character bios.

But much more than that youd be better rolling for an ISO bonus that has it and roll your th gear to it as well and can top it up with Uru if you really feel like it  but that would be a rather large gold cost.,future_fight,dd1z397,1,t5_3eui5

10574745,0,t1_dd6o9mt,I got her at T which is pretty amazing and game changing for her IMO and use her in the higher floors... I havent built her really well and  primarily use her in speed BW and she has replaced my T BW in speed AB and runs along with T Silk and T Elsa lead. I have a rr obe on her giving  with  sec Invincible when hp is below  and a Web resist. I have her atk speed at  and it works quite well for her and she doesnt get guard broken very easily. However if ur not too worried about speed AB a def pen gear with  time dmg proc along with ITGB works best could be an ideal obe lol especially at T since she lacks a bit of DPS.Dont have an ISO  yet but will give her an atk ISO  set soon. Any atk set would work. She does not need a healing or a shield ISO set . But Id recommend having atleast  SCD and rest from Alliance and close to  def pen. Pair her with an atk lead like ElsaWM etc use the rd and cancel to th and follow with th... she has quick iframes in rd and th and a long one in th so that keeps her unhittable for quite a good amount of time. ,future_fight,dd6padj,1,t5_3eui5

Marvel was eventually bought by Disney who has its own studios so Marvel wanted the licencing back.  Fox said no.  Fox is allowed to keep the rights so long as they release a movie once every so many years.  Its why we keep getting F movies despite them being so terrible.  Same deal.  Anyway both sides argued and both sides got stroppy.  Marvel is now blacklisting all XMen related goods that are not the comics.

10788749,0,t3_5ubezf,Hi.Some of my alliance friends and me agreed that we all roughly get the same amount of gold from CoOp for a fraction of the prepatch time. We occassionally get gold from the first slot and most of us are VIP  and have unlocked stage  rewards. We find it freeing that we dont have to strain our devices and glue ourselves to it just to complete CoOp mode daily. We are fine with the mode as it is now.What really sucks is the custom gear shortage from Special Missions. The bio drops are comparable prepatch except for the shifters also a concern but the gear drops are less we all agreed on that since we have been comparing rewards since the update hit. I feel like they kind of mislead us on that one. All in all this was a very nice update because for me my own personal time being saved is greater than any ingame currency.,future_fight,ddss6rw,3,t5_3eui5

10878994,0,t3_5vhcun,Marvel Television has cast former Game of Thrones star Iwan Rheon as Maximus the lead character in the upcoming Marvels The Inhumans television series.While Marvel Television and ABCs Marvels Agents of SHIELD has been dealing with Inhumans through most of its four seasons Marvels The Inhumans will focus on Marvels most popular Inhuman characters the Inhuman Royal Family.Maximus often referred to as Maximus the Mad is the brother of Black Bolt king of the Inhumans. Maximus is described in the casting announcement as being fiercely devoted to the Inhuman people their kingdom of Attilan and his brother though he desires the throne for himself.Inhumans each possess special gifts granted to them after being exposed to the Terrigen Mist and undergoing Terrigenesis. Maximuss gift is subtle mind control. In addition he is a naturally gifted scientist and inventor.Marvels The Inhumans is being written and executive produced by Scott Buck Dexter. Roel Reine will direct the first two episodes which will debut in IMAX theaters on Labor Day weekend before airing on ABC in the fall.Iwans ability to be charming roguish and still completely unexpectedly dangerous were all the different sides we needed to bring the character to life. Were thrilled to have him on board Marvel TV head Jeph Loeb said.Maximus is a complex character. Likeable charming tragic and villainous all in the same moment and Im very excited to have someone of Iwans considerable talent said Buck.The Inhumans were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the pages of Fantastic Four during the early days of the Marvel Universe. The secretive civilization was genetically engineered by the alien Kree during Earths prehistory. The Inhumans have mostly lived in seclusion in the city of Attilan which periodically relocates to different areas on Earth and sometimes to the moon. More recently the creation of two roving Terrigen Mist clouds have caused a sudden surge in Inhuman population and forced the Royals to leave the shadows and begin integrating with human society.Rheon is the first casting announcement for Marvels The Inhumans. Rheon played the vicious Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones and starred in the British series Misfits before that.,future_fight,de23a4x,2,t5_3eui5

It is almost unseless the freeze on the skill makes no difference and the gender switch is of barely any use with abundant female meta chars that can clear female AB. So it boils the uni down to only be a  stat increase for a good char and this would be the definition of a uni that is not worth it.I agree that for a new player with only a hand full of  chars its worth it for the extra AB clear but for any player that is slightly advanced its not worth to buy that uni if he dont own it yet.,future_fight,deem8dh,2,t5_3eui5

ITS AN ANALOG.Then I replied thats the worst analogy ever. And you replied backYOU DUMB. WHO YOU RESPOND TO. WHY YOU DENY THEIR RELIGIONNot knowing you where editing I replied only  inhumans by my count are Muslim. Individuals dont represent a whole.And you replied back WHO YOU REPLY TO. NOT WHAT I WROTE. YOU DONT KNOW ANALOG MEANZ.I replied back a definition of an analogy. To show I did.You replied I DID THAT. SEE YOU THE FOOL. SEE. SEE. SEE. LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL POST.So I bit knowing something was up now and looked back and saw the paragraph count quadrupled and the size of each doubled. Most shockingly though this time you actually took some effort in a reply. It still was a bad example because you still solely where focusing on Kamala and not the large collection of diverse characters they had too. So I pointed out reddit showed its an edited post and its not the same post I first replied to in the slightest but I bit my pride and moved on from that to just challenge your new assertion. You exploded and I got nothing but accusations of fallacy posting and clumsy but sly insults. Thus we stand at our current mess me a fool a who has challenged cyber bullies for over a year straight once until a mod lost it on both of us not on reddit though. Then there is you Ill avoid descriptions even knowing you wont return the favor. Though I suppose I should thank you it only took  days of me pointing out the edit for you even both claiming it was just a typo in the post above in an offshoot of this chain. Even though I feel that isnt factual and have lots of circumstantial evidence to back it up at least you directly addressing it is a form of progress.,future_fight,defxxhw,0,t5_3eui5

T Sharon Rogers. I didnt test her T in SL but her t is awesome and she can clear all content easily at t.. Keep farming Ancient One and YJ they can both clear a SL level at T. And you already have their unis! Your Silk with uni can solo early SL at t.. Since you have his uni T Iron Fist!. Use the bio seletor on MK Jane Foster or any unfarmable through missions..

Hes so solid at T that the bump honestly isnt super significant even if it is fairly noticeable against villains. I was actually kind of more impressed with the newer Ghost Rider at T.Loki is kind of in a similar position with regards to T nice but not necessary and IF with his Netflix uni kind of supplants Moon Knight in most modes these days but otherwise youre pretty good with your selections.,future_fight,dg2ah6r,1,t5_3eui5

11538522,0,t1_dg2ifsf,I get what you mean about Crystal being a different class  though the hilarious part there is that I personally think that Crystal as Blast is fine and in fact that Medusa should have been a combat character and dont understand why shes in universal. Shes badass but to me shes a combat character plain and simple because otherwise you might as well make all the Hulks universal as well because theres no logic that fits.BB though inhuman in terms of raw power and shit he could have been a blast as well but sure him I can see as being either universal or that  though I feel like they made him universal early on and by the time they did the inhumans update they went politically correct and made medusa universal since shes his partnerspouseequalwhatever.

That means soloing with  as often as you can and using low level leadership if you have to and other low levels for the occasional team up boost. Considering mapping out your roster something similar to thisIt depends on the character but attack is usually best with ITGB ignore defense crit damage crit rate and a damage increase  time proc. If its a character that I dont use in XAB but do use in shadowland I often use a stun immunity obelisk. I occasionally go for a heal or invincibility proc as well.,future_fight,dg4l28h,1,t5_3eui5

11769992,0,t1_dgu5cj4,Hmmmmm. Im thinking I will go Carnage for T and AgentVenom for T. I really dont need another BlastEnergyFemale toon so even though Enchantress is good Im gonna stay away from her and Ironheart. This leaves me with Kid Kaiju and Hyperion  are either viable at T? Part of me want to unlock them all but Im afraid Ill run out of bios for Ting Carnage. ,future_fight,dgu5rbr,1,t5_3eui5
11770296,0,t1_dgu5ac5,Carnage it is then! As for Agent Venom hell probably be used mainly for Shadowland and World Boss not too concerned about ABx.,future_fight,dgu702m,1,t5_3eui5
11774105,0,t1_dgum8fo,Thanks! But the problem is both of them are combat! I am expanding the roster. So want a UniversalSpeed type if I choose Carnage.,future_fight,dgumnwu,1,t5_3eui5

11781263,0,t3_683d00,What I dont understand is...why do we have a preparation time if we cant do anything? Makes no sense...,future_fight,dgvfzt7,1,t5_3eui5
11781285,0,t1_dgvfzt7,I dont know. Maybe its just for this first time? ,future_fight,dgvg31n,3,t5_3eui5
11783511,0,t1_dgvn539,If you combine the DefPen from Cards ISO Gear excluding the obelisk your DefPen will be at  correct? That can be filled up by equipping Urus. I think you can gain about  from equipping x  DefPen Urus on each gear. That can keep you close to the  cap.IMO if you plan on scoring high numbers in ABX then replace Stranges obelisk with this ITGB  Crit DMG   Increase DMG proc. He will benefit a lot from that obelisk. Stranges DPS also benefits a lot from Crit Damage.,future_fight,dgvp6n0,1,t5_3eui5
11792462,0,t1_dgwhxad,Thanks. Which one gives her the second Attack boost? Gamora or Deathlok?,future_fight,dgwprh4,1,t5_3eui5

11793223,0,t1_dgwsotr,Exactly. Imo he should get both and depending on his needs t one. And whatever he picked first he wont do anything wrong if he ts the other one too. ,future_fight,dgwsva0,1,t5_3eui5
11794533,0,t1_dgwu2fa,Not that Im aware of. F comes with a lot of cosmic stuff that you wouldnt even think about tbh like Annihilus and Kang.,future_fight,dgwy7vi,1,t5_3eui5
11795318,0,t1_dgwzyuh,Just got Odin. Thanks to those that recommended AO. The purple teamup button brings out Ancient Ones heal bubble without having to switch from Strange. Saved me from dying. Also I actually forgot that Red Hulks leadership has more than just the increase in fire damage. I think thats the only time I found use for the immunity to burn effect.,future_fight,dgx1far,2,t5_3eui5
11795468,0,t3_689s0k,Ok i need some serious help with world boss proxima. I need that glorious  BAM but she absolutely crushes me. My current Ts are Cap thor rocket black bolt venom and Karnak.Is there a good team of these that could beat her for that shiny orange jewel? And if so tips on how to do it.,future_fight,dgx21cu,1,t5_3eui5

11796206,0,t1_dgx3au2,I find the pierce immunity useful in TL and shes able to take higher SL levels.,future_fight,dgx51yx,1,t5_3eui5
11797914,0,t1_dgxblml,Thanks for the reply makes the decision easier.,future_fight,dgxc17e,1,t5_3eui5
11798093,0,t3_689s0k,Who are good candidates for an ITGB with dodge . and  stat increase?  Im planning to T Kate soon and Im wondering if its good for her or maybe a theres a better obelisk for her.  Thanks!,future_fight,dgxcrjk,1,t5_3eui5
11798107,0,t3_68b0pd,Elsa probably has the best leadership skill of any farmable top level speed character.,future_fight,dgxctlt,1,t5_3eui5
11798513,0,t1_dgxe89k,Hmm those are both good. Someone else might have to weigh in. Or repost that obelisk question I want to say the second one for the better damage proc also what  chance and what cooldown? but I really like itgb for the quality of life factor.Kate will still probably score higher. no harm in trying both teams though..,future_fight,dgxehgb,1,t5_3eui5
11802673,0,t3_689s0k,Moon knight or Gwen pool? Which one would you prefer to invest first,future_fight,dgxvh20,1,t5_3eui5
