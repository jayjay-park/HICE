4554326,0,t1_ct4gmmb,You will have to buy their SmartThings hub then you can connect any zwave zigbee device no matter who the manufacturer. Its as open as you can get with no monthly fees. It can be super simple to operate or like me Ive dedicated more hours than I care to say programming my home to do very specific things. ,smarthome,ct4ozo9,1,t5_2sxlm

6567387,0,t3_45g6o9,I can certainly understand why beacons would be useful in a retail environment.  Touristmuseum environments as well.  But for the life of me I cannot envision a use case for deploying beacons in a home.  What home automation scenarios can beacons solve that cant be solved better using other techniques?  The only thing Ive been able to come up with is to set a beacon in each room so that your home controller knows via your phone which lights to turn on automatically as you walk around the house.  But simple occupancy sensors can solve that.  I suppose if each person in the household wanted custom light levels then a beacon could solve that by identifying who is in each room.  But thats still a stretch.  It also requires your phone to be with you at all times.I dunno...I just dont see a use case at home that begs for beacons.  Anyone have suggestions?,smarthome,czymeq6,1,t5_2sxlm

It is also about social norms dealing with positive and negative feed back.And all and all this pennyarcade comes to mindI tend to stick to raspberry pi and home grown code. I keep my devices off the internet when ever possible.Im not comfortable with technology becoming a friend. Im comfortable with it being a tool that has a give and take.

10913166,0,t1_de4mq1c,Not so odd at all.  You start with problems that automation will easily solve.  I didnt start with this but once I had everything together in HomeAssistant this was one of the first projects I worked on.And honestly one of the more satisfying solutions.

11532326,0,t1_dg36reu,I see and likewise if you have any IFTTT applets that wont work either unless its used as a notification for instance I get a notification that the mail has arrived through a triggerlinc that triggering turns on the lamp and shoots me an email. My thoughts were because of IFTTT latency the lamp would be turned on already and I could use ifttt to scrape my email for the mails arrived notification to set the bulb to say red?,smarthome,dg36w9f,1,t5_2sxlm
