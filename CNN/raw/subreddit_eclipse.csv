On the page you linked it says  Syntax highlighting scheme optional  Download RainbowDrops.epf right click on the link and select Save link as... and import it with Eclipse builtin Preferences Import go to File gt Import... then select General gt Preferences  Of course you can use your own syntax coloring scheme if you like or import one with Eclipse Color Theme plugin.  Theres a link to it on the page or else    I saw someone linked that earlier.,eclipse,cihg2if,1,t5_2qkqg
2135152,0,t3_2jfbje,Im not a web developer so Im not completely familiar with the eclipse packages that might be good but the Helios release you linked to is several years old now.The latest Eclipse release is Luna SR  I dont see a package there equivalent to the one you linked.Personally I like to get the bare Eclipse SDK which is available here and then install appropriate addons.  Launch that eclipse and go to Help gt Install new Software.   Work With Luna   Make sure Group items by category is selected Expand the Web XML Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development Select things that look appropriate Eclipse Web Developer Tools JavaScript Development Tools etc,eclipse,clb83i4,3,t5_2qkqg
