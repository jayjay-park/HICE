5316669,0,t1_cvr43pu,I was thinking about drilling vents but then figured that for them to be effective there would have to be many both top and bottom and it would probably ruin the sturdiness of the case.I dont think mounting the dongle externally would change the temps much as the dongle is on top of the RPi anyways and heat rises.So instead what I think Im going to do in the unlikely event that it gets too hot in my plane is to crack the zipper open halfway and place the case vertically so heat rises.Another thing I could do is mount the antenna externally and run the cable through the hole into the case. I might have to do that in my plane since theres only really one way to securely fasten the antenna against the window.I also found this,stratux,cvr9mf0,1,t5_39j9c

5856440,0,t3_3v57pa,Heres an update with the next iteration prototypeAnd heres the link to the print filesSlightly taller had to be to accommodate the GPS properly. Revised the SDR holder elements to allow the antenna cables to route properly. Better snapfit on the top using ball snaps. Reduced the radius of the top and bottom edges for better printing.Everything except the antenna jack is snap fit now  the Pi fits so snugly that screws are not necessary. I printed in PLA as thats all I have. It would be better done in ABS Nylon or PET  less likely to get hot and warp.I may have another go at it the top and make a bit more room for the connections and ICs on the RYAI.

6041916,0,t1_cybku2g,Actually I would like this feature too. Perhaps in v.x? We have a Monroy ATD in our Glasair which is basically a fancy RADAR detector. A.k.a. PCAS. It makes some educated guesses about distance using r assuming a base peak xmit power. Were it me I would assume  Watts. Allows for degradation of oldoff freq xpndrs. Fails in such a way that airliners and others with more powerfulnew xpndrs appear closer. No harm in that. The Monroy unit itself doesnt work all that well but before the Monroy we had a Zaon MRX which worked VERY well. Displayed distance in  mile incrementss up to NM. So the concept works acceptably well.Apparently all the MRXs suffered hardware failures at the same time. We would have  bought another one but Zaon went out of business and we were forced to buy the Monroy.Since not everyone is ADSB out and even if they were you cant see them if theres no tower nearby it would be nice to have this PCAS feature available. Of course some clever EFB manufacturer would have to come up with a UI to support it. But first things first. First the Stratux would have to supply signal strength and decode Mode C altitude. And possibly mark ownship signal and altitude stongest so the EFBs can display Delta Alt info.,stratux,cyblsgi,1,t5_39j9c

6919010,0,t1_d10imgh,I havent tried this antenna with Stratux with the reflectors and larger coax cable its be too awkward in the Mooney anyway.  What you cant see in the picture is that further down the pole but as far up as the antenna cable would allow theres a stock antenna ducttaped to the pole.  It was used for a while before Bobby built me this SuperBobby.  The stock antenna performed fine and saw aircraft from Memphis to Nashville to Atlanta to Montgomery.  Like I said the SuperBobby has painted aircraft over  states and I dont need that much traffic from Stratux.  Im planning to build a SuperBobby for my PiAware at home and Ill probably take it flying just for fun to see how they perform with Stratux and iFly while airborne.However this brings up an interesting question  is tv coax a better fit for ADSB than the SMA antennas and SMA to MCX adapterspigtails?

I did use the windiskimager and all went smoothly.  The newer version is very nice and I cant wait to fly it tomorrow.Here is what I was doing wrong.  I have never dealt with a zip file that big before.  I got spooked when it took so darn long to unzip.  But I knew I had it when I ended up with a .gig img file.  I used the windiskimager and was Will Roger careful to make sure it went to my F drive which was my SD card.  I just needed the reassurance that I was doing it correctly as I didnt want to write to the wrong disk or start that img file runing somewhere else.  But the bottom line is I got the job done and the stratux is working nicely.I sincerely thank you guys for your help and suggestions.  Yes the XP is an old machine but it works very well for the very simple amount of computing I do.  I help friends with the new Windows and I get lost really easy.
