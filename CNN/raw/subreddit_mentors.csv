4466959,0,t3_350seh,This is funny and awesome! Well done. I wonder what your goals are. Maybe to have a financially secure life. Have someone who loves you and maybe kids.What to do next? I wonder what you think the purpose of life is.  Personally I would do a couple of things look at my character see where I can become a better person where my weaknesses are. You should also have a passion but something noble rather than sports cars. Find some cause to spend your time on that will make your part of the planet better as opposed to getting more income and buying more things which definitely makes the planet worse.Find something you dont know and study it. Maybe learn everything there is to know about DNA. Maybe sit next to a homeless person for a couple of hours and find out about hisher life and what caused it.I would also travel to a non Western country. You can learn a lot about different value systems from it.,mentors,cstqiqm,1,t5_2r7eg
