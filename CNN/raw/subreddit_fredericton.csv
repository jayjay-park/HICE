939605,0,t1_chapzhr,Im getting downvote but your story isnt clear. Someone got sick of looking at the snake yet it sounds like they werent the ones actually taking care of the snake. What justification did they give for getting rid of the snake?

10291016,0,t3_5na93z,Edit Forgot link. Hello.In my experience its usually not a situation of meds OR . If you need medication you need medication. That being said I am in no way a health care professional and am just someone who has suffered from depression but has been able to get it under control. Ive been on and off medication for about  years on it solid for  and let me tell you Im a lot more stable and happy now than I ever though I could be. If you cant find a family doctor and need to go to a walk in clinic theres one on North Side by a little strip mall I think with a Sobeys which Ive found good you talk to them about it. They can at the very least give some suggestions but maybe even prescribe something to see if that helps with the depression. This may sound scary because there is so much stigma around medication for depression and the likelyhood for it to make things worse but there are different types of depression medication and they all work differently. A walkin doctor isnt doing to try a person on something that needs extreme supervision and from my experience in Fredericton before I got a family doc theyre pretty great to deal with even with mental health stuff. Lastly I know of a person practicing downtown havent been to their service myself but have heard great things and know them personally. If you let them know your financial situation Im sure they would be able to help out as possible!Hope your partner finds what works and hit me up if you ever need any resources. Id be happy to grab a coffee. ,fredericton,dcajjfu,3,t5_2rlw3
