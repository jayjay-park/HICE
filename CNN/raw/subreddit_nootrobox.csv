5859767,0,t3_3vdk0h,Some additional thoughts on using diabetes medications  Intuitively antidiabetic agents glitazones GLP agonists metformin or straight insulin may seem useful for combatting or preventing memory loss. However the evidence is conflicting in Alzheimers Disease AD patients and usage in normal individuals is a stretch.  They have been shown to improve cognitive status in AD patients on several accountsEvidence for Insulin  Evidence for TZDs Evidence for metformin However there have been studies with negative findings as wellregarding TZDs  regarding Metformin regarding Insulin Regarding GLP agonists there are no published data on this although data in animals has suggested that GLP may play a role in memory formation Currently Nootrobox uses only FDA GRAS ingredients in all of our stacks and this is improtant to us. Just because a compound or drug helps to improve memory in diabetes or AD patients does not mean that it should be widely used in healthy individuals. Apart from the ethical concerns involved there are potential concerns involving side effects. For example fast fluctuations in insulinglucose concentration in your body are not only undesirable they can be fatal. Acute hypoglycemia formally defined as plasma glucose levels lt  mgdL can lead to autonomic dysfunctions shock or even coma. There are other short term side effects including weight gain edema diarrhea and nausea. There are long term effects as well including increased risks of cardiovascular disease especially if you already have Type  Diabetes.   While modulation of insulin levels seems promising looking into the future we currently do not have a strong enough evidence base to suggest . whether or not modulating insulin levels in the brain will improve longterm memory especially in normal individuals and . the extent to which we can do so with minimal shortterm and longterm side effects. ,nootrobox,cxnqtk6,3,t5_3aw5w
