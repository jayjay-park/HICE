11751337,0,t1_dgrchq9,honestly you are better off going to the after parties in tokyo then going to edc japan itself. its only worth going if you want to cross another international festival off your list. other then that there are alot of good after parties going on. best clubs to go to would be ageha japan number and biggest club. there are also a bunch of clubs in shibuya area which is central tokyo. If you want to talk more about it shoot me a message here or just contact me on whatsapp line afcastillofb alejandro fiacro castillo,EDCJapan,dgs1ktu,1,t5_3bvrx
