11396658,0,t1_dfnrjv6,Listen bro the last thing I worry about if Im forced to defend myself is if I kill someone! Years ago when I was younger me and my friends were attacked by a large mob of thugs while we were on our way to a club. I was armed with a knife and I used it viciously! Nobody died but many thugs were slashed or stabbed. Even with their large number the damage I did could have killed someone. Was I thinking about that at the time or was I concerned about their possible injuries? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I believe that if youre faced with the possibility of losing your and the life of family or friends you do WHATEVER you need to survive! I wasnt even concerned about the cops either! If they came upon the scene of  guys fighting against  thugs and if they saw me stab someone I would fully be ready to defend my position in court! In NY thugs arent looked at favorably when they group up to attack innocent people! We all had our tickets to the club that we were going to. Remember in court self defense is looked upon favorably. NEVER stop to wonder if defending your LIFE could have consequences! If youre DEAD then you wont be worrying about anything ever again!,fightanalysis,dfnso2d,1,t5_2xl32
