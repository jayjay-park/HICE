6181424,0,t1_cy6udtj,Ill start working on a video when I have some free time. The Duelshock  might be a bit different as far as length and width go. I still think it should work just not  sure.,SteamControllerMods,cys9hw2,2,t5_37go0
9007954,0,t3_53nn6a,This thing has been kicking around my shop for months in pieces. Allowed a friend to try their hand at painting and started them off with some primer. They went ham and put it on too thick  didnt let it flash long enough between coats so it cracked. Dont feel like spending the time to sand it so I just threw it together super quickly. Meet the junkyard controller. It functions fine so Im using it as is | ,SteamControllerMods,d7um5cz,6,t5_37go0
9873957,0,t1_dauliy7,Battery life would be quite a bit shorter than just a pair of AA primary cells unless quite a bit of extra thickness is added but would be more than sufficient for  or so hours and placing it back onto a wireless dock when youre done would keep it constantly topped up.After doing a little research this seems absolutely doable. There are some combination Qi receiver and battery charger ICs out there which would be ideal for this when paired with LiFePO cells. Some protection from overdischarging the batteries will be needed since it looks like the controller typically drains the AA cells down below V each which LiFe wont tolerate. Unfortunatley that means you wouldnt get any warning from steam when they are getting low  but perhaps some kind of indicator could be added. Or just ensure it gets back onto the charging dock after each gaming session.,SteamControllerMods,daulm5x,1,t5_37go0
