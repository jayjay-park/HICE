The third or so listenthrough Possibility Days just HIT me.Specifically right at the end with the crescendo of emotional impact starting with I said goodnight goodbye. Seems like a good thing so you know its a good lie. Leading up to The worst part of a good day is the one thing you dont say and you dont know how but you wish there was some way.
