1890651,0,t3_2g8stq,Just had my first runin with some sea guardians... they can move so quickly underwater it makes them very challenging to kill!  Also a lot spawn at once so be careful you dont get yourself swarmed... they can outswim you but dont seem to chase after you very far like other hostile mobs will.  It also appears they have thorns while their spikes are out so you get hurt when attacking too.Edit just read the wiki about the Depth Strider enchantment that was added to help combat these fast swimmers... looks like Ill need to be going after them with new boots!  Also according to the wiki the guardians can only spawn around Ocean Monuments... however there is nothing where I found them so I have to assume that this area was too heavily traveled to allow a monument to spawn but there would have been one here otherwise?  Not sure... but either way it might make a good spot for a guardian grinder if such a thing is possible!  They can be found just off the coast of the Fishermans Wharf I built on the north coast of the mesa biome.Edit  I just wanted to add now over a week later that Craftsack and I have discovered multiple ocean monuments in the new terrain out East.  Ive decided to build a guardian farm out there and so has Craft because it is much easier to mark out the correct area when you have an actual monument to start with.  The area of empty ocean is much closer to spawn but would be difficult because I wouldnt know where to put up the walls exactly with no monument for reference.  That said I have already hooked up a nether rail to the gate for my WIP farm so if youre curious you can travel out to see it fairly easily!  Im still in the waterclearing phase as of writing this btw... so if you would like to donate any materials I could use some more sand! P,crabdancemc,ckh0k21,2,t5_2snze
