If you dont mind me asking how is it having the Den closed on weekends? Do you go to Cafe Libre or do you just go to the MP?,nmu,d01i7nm,2,t5_2qmcp

We get a lot of snow. Pack boots snowboards and good tires.. NMU is one of the leastexpensive schools in the state.. If youre going to be living on campus were building new dorms like mad.. The library is going to get refreshed and modernized!. Local businesses are awesome and mostly owned by NMU alumni. Shop local shop often.. Marquette is kind of in the middle of nowhere so expect a long drive through the forest to get here.. NMU is a great place to live study and thrive. Marquette is friendly quiet and close to nature.What else do you want to know about?,nmu,dath9g1,1,t5_2qmcp
