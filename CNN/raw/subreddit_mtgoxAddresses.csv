1202747,0,t1_ci3h0tl,IMHO the output addresses would show legit withdraws so the utxo would be less than interesting to me.From the address correlation of both deposit and withdraw addresses however we could construct the internal addresses of the Gox wallet and then from that data we could look at the UTXOs that did not pass through an output in the btcxferreport.Ive been working on some address correlation of my own but since it is evenings I should be spending with my family and on other projects havent completed.  I have high confidence that large portions of the gox wallets can be recalculated.,mtgoxAddresses,ci4xe3m,2,t5_31hr8
